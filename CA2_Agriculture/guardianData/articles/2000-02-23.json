Yesterday Kevin Keegan prompted another flurry of bets when he picked Dennis Wise alongside Beckham in central midfield. </p> <p>Sir Alex Ferguson once said of Wise: \"He could start an argument in an empty house.\" So as each Argentine possesses an honours degree in wind-up technique, one can only fear for Wise's reaction when pinching in the clinches and hair-pulling behind the referee's back starts. </p> <p>However, it is testament to Keegan's plight when it comes to the shortage of quality midfield players that he is willing to gamble on such a loose cannon. For there is no doubt that on purely footballing ability, Dennis is a menace with the ball.

Trust me.\" But we have heard that before. After being sent off for stamping in August 1998, Wise declared: \"I'm fed up with being banned. I won't be getting sent off again.\" Two months later he launched a two-footed tackle on Aston Villa's Darren Byfield and bang went the promise. </p> <p>Keegan retains a mystical belief that this time, the argumentative, quick-tempered 33-year-old will show his mature side. \"I just think I can trust him,\" he said yesterday, though he did not seem to know why. \"I cannot give you evidence. I mean you watch him a lot more week in week out than I do, but I have seen bits on television.\" </p> <p>Real-life experience would suggest Keegan's eternal optimism has entered dreamland. Certainly he will be pilloried unmercifully if the gamble backfires while Wise will definitely have seen the end of his international career. But if it works, England might at last have found someone with the energy and ability to give and move that the torpid midfield has been crying out for. </p> <p>\"He has this opportunity,\" said Keegan. \"And it is against Argentina, so it is a good game for him to answer all the questions that have been asked of him for a period of time.\" The nation will be praying there is a first time for everything.</p>",

Trust me.\" But we have heard that before. After being sent off for stamping in August 1998, Wise declared: \"I'm fed up with being banned. I won't be getting sent off again.\" Two months later he launched a two-footed tackle on Aston Villa's Darren Byfield and bang went the promise. Keegan retains a mystical belief that this time, the argumentative, quick-tempered 33-year-old will show his mature side. \"I just think I can trust him,\" he said yesterday, though he did not seem to know why. \"I cannot give you evidence. I mean you watch him a lot more week in week out than I do, but I have seen bits on television.\" Real-life experience would suggest Keegan's eternal optimism has entered dreamland. Certainly he will be pilloried unmercifully if the gamble backfires while Wise will definitely have seen the end of his international career. But if it works, England might at last have found someone with the energy and ability to give and move that the torpid midfield has been crying out for. \"He has this opportunity,\" said Keegan. \"And it is against Argentina, so it is a good game for him to answer all the questions that have been asked of him for a period of time.\" The nation will be praying there is a first time for everything.",

The England No4 made a classy 25 and it needed an amazing catch at long-leg by the Cook Islands schoolgirl Munukoa Tunupopo, who will be 16 today, to remove her. However the tourists were beaten by six wickets in this rain-affected final match and have lost 11 of their 12 games, the only win coming against a weak Wellington side in their first match in New Zealand. But there have been some plus points. The bowling and the fielding have improved: New Zealand had to fight to make an adjusted figure of 63 in 29 overs following rain - which had delayed the start by two hours and which interrupted their reply at 29 for one chasing 86 all out. Rain makes a habit of plaguing international matches here in Napier and though having the floodlights stolen, or part of them at least, was not enough to hold up play, the downpours were. The umpires somehow dredged up the long-abandoned average-runs-per-over system, though, and the end was a joke. For England, a bad one.",

      "body": "<p> Stanley Matthews, who has died aged 85, was the first ever European Footballer of the Year, and arguably the outstanding British player of his generation. He was nicknamed the Wizard of Dribble in Britain, and known abroad as Der Zauberer - the magician.</p> <p> His remarkable career stretched from well before the second world war to the 1960s; he was still playing League football at 50. At 41, at Wembley, he was capable of demolishing as famous a left back as Brazil's Milton Santos. Afterwards, in the England dressing room, in a rare moment of spleen, he said that when he read that he was too old he was sometimes tempted to tear the paper across. </p> <p>But the truth is that throughout his magical career, Matthews was constantly being accused of being too this, that or the other. Too unpredictable. Too individualistic. Too slow to release the ball. In one wartime Wembley international at Wembley there was a small scandal when it was alleged that he had deliberately been starved of the ball. At the end of the war, when football officially restarted, he was excluded from the England team for most of the 1946/7 season in favour of Tom Finney, an outside right with almost as remarkable a body swerve. Only to return in triumph in Lisbon, Matthews on the right, Finney on he left, Portugal routed, 10-0.</p> <p> As early as November, 1934, when England won the bruising Battle of Highbury against an Italian team which ran amok when its Argentine captain, Luisito Monti, limped early off the field with a broken foot, Matthews was damned in the Daily Mail. Geoffrey Simpson, its sports columnist, wrote: \"I saw Matthews play just as moderately in the recent inter-League match, exhibiting the same slowness and hesitation. Perhaps he lacks the big match temperament.\"</p> <p> Matthews was born at Hanley in the Potteries, the son of a formidable boxer Jack Matthews, a formidable boxer known as \"the Fighting Barber of Hanley\". Jack encouraged Matthews and his other children to keep physically fit, doing deep breathing exercises in front of an open window even on the coldest mornings. In later years, Matthews would devise his own regimes based on long runs across the Blackpool beaches. It used to be said that if you passed his house at 9pm, the lights of his bedroom would be out.</p> <p> His swerve was something which defied analysis; just as it defied attempts to counter it. He would take the ball up to the opposing left back who, even if he were mentally prepared for it, would still \"buy\" the dummy when Matthews swayed slightly to the left, putting the opponent off balance, only to wriggle round to the right, flick the ball up the touchline with the outside of his right foot, and sprint away. Catch him if you could. Over those vital first ten yards or so, he was beyond pursuit. \"Don't ask me how I do it,\" he once said of the swerve. \"It just comes out of me under pressure.\"</p> <p> Having sped past his left back and reached the goal line, Matthews would then pull the ball back into the goalmouth; the most effective pass in the game. He seldom scored himself, but he could do so when necessary. Not least when playing at Tottenham for England against Czechoslovakia in 1937. Injury reduced England to 10 fit men, and their unbeaten home record against foreign teams seemed in jeopardy. But Matthews, moving to inside-right, scored three times, and England won, 5-4.</p> <p> Much later, in the 1954 World Cup in Switzerland, when England were struggling in their opening game against Belgium, Matthews moved to inside-forward, galvanised the team, and helped it to gain a 4-4 draw. Over the years he would time and again fall foul of the England selectors, troubled by so maverick a talent. It is true that he began badly, a 19-year-old, in his first two internationals against Wales and Italy but it wasn't long before the \"big match temperament\" was asserting itself.</p> <p> In May 1939, in the Berlin Olympic Stadium, he had one of his finest games for England just when they needed it most. Forced to give the Nazi salute before they played the German international side, England proceeded to cut them to ribbons, with Matthews rampant, irresistible against a full back who had played him out of the game when last the teams met. Muenzenberg could do nothing with him that day and England won, 6-3.</p> <p> An outstanding schoolboy footballer, he once scored a dozen goals in a game from centre-half. He played for England schoolboys, joined his local club Stoke City straight from school, worked in the office, and made his league debut for them soon after he had turned 17. But even before the war, his relations with the club degenerated with the appointment as manager of Bob McGrory, a former Stoke defender. It has been suggested that McGrory was displeased by the fact that Matthews had replaced his friend, Bobby Liddle, on the right wing. Relations didn't improve when Matthews returned to Stoke after the second world war.</p> <p> During the war, he had played as a guest for Blackpool, a town where he and his wife, Jean, had opened a small hotel. Things came to a climax early in the 1946/7 season when Matthews was kept out of the Stoke team by the young winger, George Mountford. Eventually Stoke agreed to transfer him to Blackpool, for the sum of \u00a311,500. Matthews would stay there happily, forming famous wing partnerships with Stan Mortensen and Jackie Mudie, until his romantic and belated return to Stoke, in 1961.</p> <p> The war ate up much of his \"official\" career, but he found an ideal partner in the England team in Sunderland's Raich Carter, even though Carter once complained that when he gave Matthews the ball, he never got it back. Tactfully, his captain, Stanley Cullis, responded that having passed he should move into the middle. The England attack, which included Tommy Lawton and Denis Compton, was an outstanding one, with an 8-0 win over Scotland at Maine Road, Manchester, to its credit.</p> <p> Losing then regaining his place in the England team in the first official post war season, 1946/7, Matthews excelled in Lisbon against Portugal and, a year later, in Turin, reduced poor, blond Eliani - standing in as Italy's left back for Maroso - to tatters. England won 4-0.</p> <p> But when it came to Cup Finals, a winner's medal persistently eluded Matthews. In the 1948 Final, Blackpool lost 4-2 to Manchester United, despite taking the lead through a penalty kick by Eddie Shimwell. In 1951, two spectacular goals by Jackie Milburn enabled Newcastle United to win, 2-0. 1953 would almost surely be the last chance. Blackpool were to meet Bolton, and this time, luck favoured them when Bell, left-half - and thus a direct opponent for Matthews - was hurt and had to limp along the left wing.</p> <p> Even then, Blackpool made very heavy weather of it. They conceded an absurd early goal when their Scottish international keeper, George Farm, pitifully misjudged a shot by Nat Lofthouse after a mere 75 seconds. Lofthouse hit the post, Bell tore a muscle and Bolton were already down to ten active men. Stan Mortensen would later say that Bolton lost the game when they decided to move their English international left winger Bobby Langton inside, rather than let him contest space with Matthews, on the wing. Blackpool's equaliser, 10 minutes from the break, was a fluke, the ball going in off their emergency left-half, Harold Hassall. But Bolton gallantly hit back with two goals, one by Moir, with Farm at fault again, the second a brave header by Bell himself. There were only 20 minutes left.</p> <p> It was now that Matthews, strangely obscure till then, at last came into the game. Tommy Banks, Bolton's left back, was exhausted by his efforts to halt Matthews, contracting cramp in his shins, and four times leaving the field for treatment in the final quarter hour. One more Matthews run, a cross which would have gone out of play had Hanson, Bolton's keeper, not flapped at it, reached Mortensen on the far post and went in. 3-2. Mortensen equalised breathlessly from a free kick.</p> <p> Then clasically, Matthews got away again on the right, beat Banks, took the ball up to the centre half, Barrass, and pulled back an exquisite cross not to Mortensen but to the South African left winger Perry free on the far post. A right-footed shot and the Matthews Final had been won by Blackpool. Would England have prevailed in the most humiliating match of their history, that defeat by the USA at Belo Horizonte in the 1950 World Cup, had Matthews played? Perhaps; but he didn't. Indeed it was only at the last moment that he was grudgingly recalled from an FA XI tour of North America to play in Brazil at all. He did play the last England game, lost against Spain in Rio 1-0, but the die was cast by then.</p> <p> Matthews's long marriage to Betty ended in 1968. Matthews remarried, this time a, Czech linguist, Mila Winter, cultural assistant at the US embassy and wife of a well known Czech painter.</p> <p> He and Betty had two children, Jean and Stanley junior. The latter became three times British Junior tennis champion, and won the Wimbledon Junior Invitation title. He never quite fulfilled his early promise, and eventually turned to coaching in the United States.</p> <p> Knighted in 1965, a month before his 50th birthday, Matthews altogether made 698 appearances in the Football League for 71 goals, and played 54 full internationals for Englands for 11 goals.

An attacking Irish line-up features the left foot of Ian Harte at left-back in favour of Staunton, who warms the bench. Both sides were saturated by the rain lashing Lansdowne Road within moments of emerging onto the pitch.<br><strong>2</strong> Cunningham in hard but seemingly fair with a high-velocity sliding tackle. The referee informs him that he wants to see none of that during this game and awards a free kick to the visitors. Even Berger looks puzzled with that decision. <br><strong>3</strong> An early scare for the Irish as Butler is skinned by Kollar by a through-ball on the right flank as the remainder of the Irish defence appeal for offside. Butler recovers well to force a corner.<br><strong>4 GOAL Republic of Ireland 0 - 1 Czech Republic</strong> Horrible defending from the home team as Kollar gets two chances to roof the ball into the Irish net from 10 yards at the far post. Accusing glances all long the Irish back four as the distant Harte tries to avoid making eye contact with any of the 30,000 spectators. A bad, bad start.<br><strong>8</strong> Kinsella feeds Roy Keane from the centre circle and the United captain advances and tries his luck from 25 yards. His luck's out and the ball barely makes the dead ball line. Goal kick. <br><strong>11</strong> Ireland are trying to be a little too cute and walk it out of their defence. The Czech's are proving too good a side to disrespect like that and the visitors are winning back possession with alarming regularity.<br><strong>12</strong> Again Kollar races through the Irish offside trap, seemingly by osmosis and Gary Kelly saves Ireland's blushes with a timely interception.<br><strong>16 GOAL Republic of Ireland 1 - 1 Czech Republic</strong> Two corners, two goals. An excellent, inswinging corner hit with pace delivered by Kennedy on the right is deflected off the head of Karel Rada and past Maier for an own goal.<br><strong>18</strong> The Irish are reinvigorated. A free kick on the left is played quickly to Harte, who likes to hit them from distance with his left peg. The contact is not so good, put the shot is well placed and Maier does well to hang on as Quinn and Robbie Keane are ready to pounce should Maier fail to hold on.<br><strong>20</strong> The home side break again, this time on the right flank through Kennedy, who races into the Czech box. His centre is played out by Rada as far as Quinn, who from 15 yards chests the ball to control it, but can only spoon his shot over the crossbar.<br><strong>23</strong> Robbie Keane and Poborsky are 'enjoying' a personal battle of wills on the left wing. So far the Coventry forward's changes of pace have yet to shake off Poborsky's attentions.<br><strong>26</strong> Poborsky reminds the Irish not to push up too far as he runs the length of the pitch, beating and/or holding off three, four Irish defenders only to shoot wide from just inside the box.<br><strong>27</strong> So far an excellent friendly - relentless end-to-end stuff. A corner to Ireland, taken short but poorly thought out and the advantage is lost. Ian Harte miss-times a tackle and is booked. <br><strong>30</strong> So close to two-one. Robbie Keane runs on to a great flick from Niall Quinn but Maier does everything right to deny the young striker. The Czech keeper enjoys the luck of the Irish as the rebound falls to Repka, who clears.<br><strong>33</strong> The Czechs counter again, this time from Smicer on the right. He jinks and cuts back and jinks again, all to no avail as he loses possession in the Irish penalty area. <br><strong>35 GOAL Republic of Ireland 1 - 2 Czech Republic</strong> A beautiful, simple goal made all the more simple due to the lack of any meaningful marking by the home side. Berger spreads the play out right to Poborsky with the outside of his boot. His cross is met with power by Kollar and Kelly has no chance. Ireland playing catch-up once more.<br><strong>39</strong> Czech possession results in a Kollar knock-down on the edge of the Irish area to Smicer. His volley is a poor one and leaves the field at a tangent to the Irish goal.<br><strong>42</strong> Kennedy beats Gabriel but Rada cuts out his cross for a corner. The inswinger is a good one but Repka manages to clear.<br><strong>43 GOAL Republic of Ireland 2 - 2 Czech Republic</strong> The ball is eventually played back in by Gary Kelly and what looks like a simple catch for Maier becomes impossible as Kollar challenges his own keeper for the ball. It sails past both of them and into the path of Ian Harte, who cannot miss from 10 yards into an empty net.<br><strong>46</strong> Half time in a very entertaining match. It's even stopped raining.<br></p> <p><strong>45</strong> Here's hoping the second half is as full of incident as the first. Ireland restart the match.<br><strong>45 Republic of Ireland substitution:</strong> McAteer for Butler; Babb for Kennedy.<br><strong>48</strong> Ireland playing with the wind this half. Ian Harte overhits a pass by 30 yards and it sails out of play. Goal kick.<br><strong>50</strong> Phil Babb's first contribution is a cross from deep that Quinn just fails to knock down. An optimistic start to the second half by the home side.<br><strong>52</strong> The tenacious Kilbane wins a corner on the right. Kinsella delivers and football pinball ensues in a crowded Czech box. The ball emerges and heads goalwards. Nedved clears from off, or perhaps behind his own goal line and as the Irish players appeal the ball is played back in but Maier is fouled and play breaks down.

      "bodyText": "Republic of Ireland: A. Kelly, G. Kelly, Harte, Butler, Cunningham, R. Keane, Kennedy, Kinsella, Quinn, R. Keane, Kilbane. Substitutes: McAteer, Connolly, Staunton, Babb, Kiely, Breen, Carr, Finnan, Holland. Czech Republic: Maier, T. Repka, Rada, Nedved, Gabriel, Bejbl, Nemec, Poborsky, Kollar, Smicer, Berger. Substitutes: Latal, Rosicky, Suchoparek, Horvath, Cerny, Kuka, Wagner. 1 min Kick off in an intriguing friendly between the second-best team in the world according to the most recent FIFA rankings and a Republic of Ireland team unbeaten at home since 1995. An attacking Irish line-up features the left foot of Ian Harte at left-back in favour of Staunton, who warms the bench. Both sides were saturated by the rain lashing Lansdowne Road within moments of emerging onto the pitch. 2 Cunningham in hard but seemingly fair with a high-velocity sliding tackle. The referee informs him that he wants to see none of that during this game and awards a free kick to the visitors. Even Berger looks puzzled with that decision. 3 An early scare for the Irish as Butler is skinned by Kollar by a through-ball on the right flank as the remainder of the Irish defence appeal for offside. Butler recovers well to force a corner. 4 GOAL Republic of Ireland 0 - 1 Czech Republic Horrible defending from the home team as Kollar gets two chances to roof the ball into the Irish net from 10 yards at the far post. Accusing glances all long the Irish back four as the distant Harte tries to avoid making eye contact with any of the 30,000 spectators. A bad, bad start. 8 Kinsella feeds Roy Keane from the centre circle and the United captain advances and tries his luck from 25 yards. His luck's out and the ball barely makes the dead ball line. Goal kick. 11 Ireland are trying to be a little too cute and walk it out of their defence. The Czech's are proving too good a side to disrespect like that and the visitors are winning back possession with alarming regularity. 12 Again Kollar races through the Irish offside trap, seemingly by osmosis and Gary Kelly saves Ireland's blushes with a timely interception. 16 GOAL Republic of Ireland 1 - 1 Czech Republic Two corners, two goals. An excellent, inswinging corner hit with pace delivered by Kennedy on the right is deflected off the head of Karel Rada and past Maier for an own goal. 18 The Irish are reinvigorated. A free kick on the left is played quickly to Harte, who likes to hit them from distance with his left peg. The contact is not so good, put the shot is well placed and Maier does well to hang on as Quinn and Robbie Keane are ready to pounce should Maier fail to hold on. 20 The home side break again, this time on the right flank through Kennedy, who races into the Czech box. His centre is played out by Rada as far as Quinn, who from 15 yards chests the ball to control it, but can only spoon his shot over the crossbar. 23 Robbie Keane and Poborsky are 'enjoying' a personal battle of wills on the left wing. So far the Coventry forward's changes of pace have yet to shake off Poborsky's attentions. 26 Poborsky reminds the Irish not to push up too far as he runs the length of the pitch, beating and/or holding off three, four Irish defenders only to shoot wide from just inside the box. 27 So far an excellent friendly - relentless end-to-end stuff. A corner to Ireland, taken short but poorly thought out and the advantage is lost. Ian Harte miss-times a tackle and is booked. 30 So close to two-one. Robbie Keane runs on to a great flick from Niall Quinn but Maier does everything right to deny the young striker. The Czech keeper enjoys the luck of the Irish as the rebound falls to Repka, who clears. 33 The Czechs counter again, this time from Smicer on the right. He jinks and cuts back and jinks again, all to no avail as he loses possession in the Irish penalty area. 35 GOAL Republic of Ireland 1 - 2 Czech Republic A beautiful, simple goal made all the more simple due to the lack of any meaningful marking by the home side. Berger spreads the play out right to Poborsky with the outside of his boot. His cross is met with power by Kollar and Kelly has no chance. Ireland playing catch-up once more. 39 Czech possession results in a Kollar knock-down on the edge of the Irish area to Smicer. His volley is a poor one and leaves the field at a tangent to the Irish goal. 42 Kennedy beats Gabriel but Rada cuts out his cross for a corner. The inswinger is a good one but Repka manages to clear. 43 GOAL Republic of Ireland 2 - 2 Czech Republic The ball is eventually played back in by Gary Kelly and what looks like a simple catch for Maier becomes impossible as Kollar challenges his own keeper for the ball. It sails past both of them and into the path of Ian Harte, who cannot miss from 10 yards into an empty net. 46 Half time in a very entertaining match. It's even stopped raining. 45 Here's hoping the second half is as full of incident as the first. Ireland restart the match. 45 Republic of Ireland substitution: McAteer for Butler; Babb for Kennedy. 48 Ireland playing with the wind this half. Ian Harte overhits a pass by 30 yards and it sails out of play. Goal kick. 50 Phil Babb's first contribution is a cross from deep that Quinn just fails to knock down. An optimistic start to the second half by the home side. 52 The tenacious Kilbane wins a corner on the right. Kinsella delivers and football pinball ensues in a crowded Czech box. The ball emerges and heads goalwards. Nedved clears from off, or perhaps behind his own goal line and as the Irish players appeal the ball is played back in but Maier is fouled and play breaks down. The Czechs are lucky to not be trailing for the first time in this match. 56 Czech Republic substitution: Wagner for Smicer. 57 Robbie Keane is played through on the right flank by his namesake Roy. Once again, he uses his great pace and once again he loses the ball. He does that a lot. 59 Maier hates it when Kinsella crosses. A corner to Ireland and Maier comes for it, fumbles and can only lie on the floor and watch as his defenders get him out of yet another fine mess. 61 Czech Republic substitution: Latal for Nemec. 63 Kilbane does all the hard work on the left, beating three players and then crosses the ball over Quinn, Maier and the crossbar. 66 Some head tennis in the Czech area ends with the ball in the net, but the ref's whistle had halted play just moments prior to Roy Keane crashing the ball into the goal. 69 Czech Republic substitution: Kuka for Kollar. 70 Kilbane again on the right, beating his man and choosing to ignore the waving arms of Robbie Keane and Niall Quinn, strikes a weak shot wide of Maier's right-hand post. 71 Once more it's that man Kilbane, who chooses to cross to Robbie Keane.

The home side deserve the win, but can they get the all-important goal? Niall Quinn looks aggrieved as Bejbl drapes himself all over the tall Irishman in the visitors' penalty area. The referee is unmoved. 86 Niall Quinn knocks it down for Phil Babb 15 yards out with his back to goal. No problem.

A spokesman for Stoke City football club said the former star regularly went to Tenerife to escape the British winter. The spokesman said that he understood Sir Stanley had gone to the island in the Canaries in December last year and had been due back some time now. </p> <p>Matthews made his international debut at the age of 19 and collected his last cap in 1956 when, aged 41, he mesmerised the Brazilian defence in England's 4-2 win at Wembley. </p> <p>Matthews spent his 33-year league career with two unfashionable north of England clubs, Stoke City and Blackpool.

Twice a losing finalist with Blackpool in 1948 and 1951, Matthews stood 20 minutes away from a third defeat with his team 3-1 down to Bolton. Then his dazzling footwork carved out the last two goals of a hat-trick for Stan Mortensen, and Matthews went on to set up the winner for Bill Perry with 20 seconds left. Despite Mortensen's treble it was a game which would always be remembered as \"the Matthews final\". </p> <p>Matthews was born in Hanley on February 1 1915, the third of four sons.

And in 1937 he hit his only international hat-trick in a 5-4 win over Czechoslovakia. </p> <p>At Matthews' 80th birthday celebrations, former England captain Jimmy Armfield praised his skills and sportsmanship. \"You could kick him and do anything with him and he would never retaliate,\" said Armfield. \"He was the perfect example of self-discipline. I never remember a referee speaking to him once - and he didn't speak to them either.\" </p> <p>Matthews, known as 'the Wizard of the Dribble', was a crowd-pleaser to generations and tempted a British record crowd, 149,547, to Hampden Park in Glasgow. But he never earned more than \u00a350 a week, plus \u00a325-a-game bonus.

There are the dozens of fantasy novels, including the Elric series which made his name; there is the prize-winning Cornelius Quartet (1966-77), whose polysexual dandy-nihilist hero Jerry Cornelius shared Moorcock's own Notting Hill home of the era, turning that quarter of London into a mythical zone for decades of bohemians. And then, there's Mother London (1988), his time-chopping tribute to his city from the Blitz to Thatcher, and his Colonel Pyat quartet, thousands of pages long, still unfinished, a digging into the Holocaust's roots. And King of the City, his new London novel, out on CD next month. And he was in Hawkwind. And played banjo for Brian Eno. \"It's like grabbing Dickens by the coat-tails,\" fellow urban diviner Iain Sinclair reported, after trailing him last year. \"English fiction's Lord of Misrule,\" declared Angela Carter.</p> <p>\"I was an infant prodigy,\" Moorcock breezily admits. \"It's just one of those things. I was known as a smart kid from the time I could walk. Looking back, I can see why people were so nice to me. I've got teenage correspondence that goes from Woody Guthrie to Tolkien to Peake. I now realise not everyone is treated this way. I was just very confident. I'd written a social novel by the time I was 17, it was easy. The thing I've got, it's like Mozart - I can read an example of a genre, and once I've picked up what's in it, I know it. What I can do is put structures together, as easy as pie.\"</p> <p>Moorcock's artistic proving ground was New Worlds, the science fiction magazine he edited from 1964 to 1971. He published the genre's key experimenters - JG Ballard, Brian Aldiss, M John Harrison and more. But he wasn't interested in the genre for its own sake, and sought instead \"an idiom that dealt with our experience\" - a response to changing times. There were fist-fights in the office over artistic principle. </p> <p>\"I had to be a barmy despot for it to work,\" he remembers, \"but it stopped me growing up. It froze me. I'd always had a lot of power, since I was a child, but I didn't understand it. It was only after my second marriage collapsed that I looked back and recognised I'd been careering, going too fast. I looked after my kids at the same time, I loved them. I don't think my relationships with them suffered very much. They may have a different idea of it. But in terms of personal relationships, it was disastrous.\"</p> <p>Iain Sinclair took Moorcock back to his Notting Hill home of those days recently. It's been subjected to total gentrification, of course, defined now by Julia Roberts, not Jerry Cornelius. Once, though, things were different. \"The year George Melly moved into Notting Hill, 1980, I moved out,\" says Moorcock, \"because there were already too many pine shops. But when I arrived in 1957, there were police raids every night. It was the area of Peter Rackman, who I knew and liked, and think got a very bad rap.\"</p> <p>By the mid-60s though, Moorcock could feel his city lighting up bit by bit, not least Notting Hill. The nascent pop industry settled in nearby Ladbroke Grove, there were \"at least three famous rock groups on every block\". The first Cornelius book, The Final Programme (1966), was mocking yet heartfelt in celebrating the times. \"I was central,\" says Moorcock. \"All the hippies loved the fantasy books, they never read anything else. Everybody who was really famous really liked me. I flung myself into the counter- culture, because I'm a hedonist, and I loved the drugs. I loved everything. When you're in a car with women who are genuinely feeling great and sexy, and you've got nowhere else to go and nothing else to do, and you're stoned out of your brain, and you're famous and everybody recognises you - it can't get much better.\"</p> <p>But he knew it couldn't last. The latter parts of the Cornelius Quartet see Jerry broken, brought down by a mood of aching, nostalgic loss. \"I can do lyrical loss at the drop of a hat,\" says Moorcock. \"It's natural to me. My childhood was in the Blitz. And what happens is, you have no past, in a peculiar way, because all your early memories are of ruins - huge concrete blocks, little byways, bits of rosemary and willow herb that were yours. Then it gets built over, and you've lost a whole world. I form very loyal friendships, too, perhaps because I know I may lose them. Existentialism and entropy were in the air when I was young, as well. All my early Elrics are like fantasies by Camus.\" Moorcock's celebrity survived into punk, but by the time of Thatcher, the game was really up. \"Thatcherism made the language of liberal humanism sound silly,\" he sighs. \"In the 70s, if I said something, generally it got reported. With Thatcherism, I learned how rapidly the rhetoric shifts. As early as 1978, when a poet friend called Bill Butler died of an overdose, his funeral was like a Spanish Civil War veteran's. I'd never seen so many Afghan coats. The sense of being marginalised, defeated revolutionaries was very strong.\"</p> <p>Still, when the power drained from him, Moorcock grew up at last. With his third wife Linda, he moved to Texas. He also wrote his most extraordinary work, the \"memoirs\" of Colonel Pyat, full of fantastic sights from adventures in the years 1900-40, narrated by a self-deceiving, Jewish anti-Semite. Byzantium Endures, The Laughter of Carthage and Jerusalem Commands (1981-92) now await a final volume. \"It's just so horrible getting into his head,\" Moorcock explains. \"It's something my wife doesn't want me to do, and I don't, because you start to become this awful character. But it's the only way. What I wanted to do was to get inside the sort of person who was my natural enemy - I'm part-Jewish. The last book is nearly finished. I know it sounds pious, but it does feel like a holy subject to me, and it's something I have to be careful with. I don't want to pick over the bones of the dead. I'm actually trying to produce a memorial.\" Meanwhile with his newest book, another London love song, King Michael makes it clear that he isn't stepping down yet. \"All I know is,\" he says, \"is that I was given a bit of talent.

After hearing evidence on the third day of the inquest at Westminster council chambers, coroner Paul Knapman adjourned the hearing at the request of the lord chancellor, Lord Irvine of Lairg, pending the conclusion of a public inquiry into the accident by Lord Cullen. Under an amendment to the access to justice act passed in January and being used for the first time, the jury was dismissed without being required to reach a verdict. The specific purpose of the inquest was to allow the deaths of the victims to be registered, but it was felt in this case that it would be of use to the families to hear some details of their loved ones' deaths. The lord chancellor is empowered to halt such an inquest at any time. Speaking after the adjournment Louise Christian, who heads the crash victims' solicitors group, welcomed the decision: \"It has been good for families to come and hear the circumstances in which their loved ones died, and we're grateful to the coroner for allowing them that opportunity.\" She added that Dr Knapman should consider resuming the inquest after the Cullen inquiry had reported: \"I believe a number of my clients will want the inquest to resume, particularly if they feel... a verdict of, for example, unlawful killing would be appropriate.\" It is thought unlikely the inquest will be resumed, though legislation does allow the coroner to reconvene the hearing \"if he believes there is exceptional reason for doing so\". The legislation, specific to major accidents where a public inquiry is due to be convened, was introduced to stop the duplication of evidence heard by inquests and inquiries and prevent delays. A jury was called in this case only because juries are currently compulsory in rail crash inquests. The public inquiry into the 1997 Southall rail crash did not begin taking evidence until two years after the accident. Lord Cullen will begin to hear evidence in May. A criminal investigation by British Transport Police, Operation Brodie, is also under way. Earlier the inquest heard details of the deaths of the final six victims of the crash, which happened shortly after 8.10am on the morning of October 5 when a three-carriage Thames train bound for Bedwyn, Wilts from Paddington collided with a First Great Western travelling in the opposite direction. The Thames train was attempting to join the main line away from London and is believed to have passed through a red signal shortly before it crossed the path of the larger locomotive. The jury heard that the driver of the Great Western train, Brian Cooper, 52, was thrown some distance from the train and died instantly from multiple injuries. A toxicology report confirmed that he had not taken drink or drugs before the crash. It also emerged that one of the victims may have initially survived that collision, and died trapped in the wreckage. A post mortem examination on Allan Stewart, 28, an accountant raised in New Zealand, revealed that he had endured \"a period of survival\" of between one and 59 minutes after the accident. The jury also heard details of the death of Fiona Grey, 33, an IT consultant from Dumbarton. She had started a new job in London two days before the accident. Ms Grey had been sitting in the front carriage of the Great Western train next to her new boss, with whom she was lodging in Didcot, Oxfordshire.",

      "bodyText": "Home secretary Jack Straw, delivering his first annual progress report on the action plan drawn up after the Macpherson inquiry into the Stephen Lawrence affair, warned the police today to stop grumbling and to keep working to eradicate institutional racism. He acknowledged that the report on the police handling of the inquiry into the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence had made uncomfortable reading. \"But there is no reason for the report to have been a trauma for the police service. It was a shock.\" Some officers have suggested that rising levels of street crime could be due to police not carrying out stop-and-searches for fear of being accused of racism. The Metropolitan force was described as \"institutionally racist\" by the report. Mr Straw said he believed the report had opened people's eyes to the unequal treatment some people in Britain received simply because of the colour of their skin. It also emerged today that a third of ethnic minority staff in the home office, Mr Straw's own department, say they have suffered racial discrimination at work, although the majority believe the department is committed to equal opportunities. Mr Straw said he believed there had been a \"significant reduction\" in levels of racism experienced by people at the hands of public bodies. The action plan progress report claimed more than half the recommendations made by Sir William had been implemented. Work was under way on the remainder. Action taken included the introduction of the new race relations act, better recording and investigation of racist incidents and racism education programmes in schools. The report said new policies to ensure stop and search powers were used more fairly and effectively were being drawn up, police were getting better training in race awareness and the recruitment of ethnic minority police officers was being stepped up. Two of the most controversial proposals put forward by Sir William remained under consideration. A conclusion on whether to scrap the double jeopardy rule which blocks the prosecution of someone twice for the same crime is not expected before early next year. Additionally, a working party is still looking at whether to change the law to allow people to be prosecuted for using racist language in private. Mr Straw stated his commitment to independent investigation of complaints against police officers, rather than the current practice of inquiries being carried out by fellow officers. He said: \"I am under no illusions that we have a long way to go. Full delivery of the action plan can only be a start on the road to delivering a truly multicultural Britain, not just free from the scourge of racism, but where diversity becomes a cornerstone of our modern society.\" Fred Broughton, chairman of the Police Federation, commented: \"The service has come a long way since Macpherson but knows there is further to go, with more mountains to climb.\" The crown prosecution service also published details today of the progress it has made in meeting the report's recommendations. Almost a year after the release of the report on the Stephen Lawrence inquiry, the director of public prosecutions, David Calvert-Smith, concluded that the service had achieved a \"great deal\". However, he admitted that it \"still had much to do\", particularly in improving communications with victims of racist crime. Under new plans, crown prosecution staff will offer to meet victims of racially-motivated crimes to explain its decision not to prosecute or to substantially alter charges. They will also receive extra training in handling such cases sensitively. The service adopted the Macpherson report's new definition of a racist incident and renamed its monitoring unit accordingly. Additionally, special care will be taken to ensure that any evidence of racist motivation for a crime is referred to during the trial and any pre-trial hearings to establish correct evidence. Defendants will not be allowed to plea-bargain (submit a guilty plea in the hope of more lenient sentencing, which saves the court time) in order to conceal any racist elements of their crime.",

The appointment of a fifth woman to the nine-member cabinet was hailed as a milestone in equal opportunities by the new Labour first secretary, Rhodri Morgan. Sue Essex, 54, was awarded the post of environment secretary as part of a minor reshuffle by Mr Morgan, joining the four existing female members of his Labour cabinet. Tony Blair's cabinet, by contrast, contains only four women out of a total of 22 members, while men outnumber their female cabinet colleagues in every other European country.

But even in the age of career coaches like Graham Ford and John Buchanan, great value is still attached to Test experience. It does help if this is, as the pros say, in the right area.

      "bodyText": "A major international conference organised by the commission for racial equality and backed by Tony Blair, which was supposed to showcase Britain's anti-racist achievements, collapsed yesterday amid official allegations of inadequate financial and management control. The company set up by the CRE to organise the global cultural diversity congress in Cardiff next month went into liquidation on Monday when the home office refused to bail it out with a further \u00a31.5m after a report by government accountants raised \"serious questions about the quality of the management and financial controls in GCDC 2000 Ltd\". Despite claims that the organisers had \"over 1,000 pre-registered delegates\", fewer than 500 tickets were sold for a congress initially planned to attract 2,000. The congress also failed to attract the sponsorship it needed, despite being such a high profile event. The collapse of the congress, which was co-hosted by the national assembly for Wales, the CRE and the Australian multicultural foundation, is particularly embarrassing for the government as it coincides with the first anniversary of the publication of the official inquiry report into the death of the murdered black London teenager Stephen Lawrence. The congress was to be addressed by Jack Straw, the home secretary; Alun Michael, the former first secretary of the Welsh assembly; Sir Herman Ouseley, the outgoing chairman of the CRE; and Michael Mansfield, the civil rights lawyer, as part of the government's plans to demonstrate that \"Britain is a beacon to the world\" when it comes to race issues. Nelson Mandela had been invited to speak and senior government ministers from Australia, China and Canada were due to address the four-day conference originally scheduled between March 20 and 23. Among the directors of GCDC 2000 Ltd who may now face personal liability are its chairman, Bob Purkiss, a CRE commissioner; Hugh Harris, the acting chairman of the CRE; Chris Mayant, the CRE's chief press officer; Susie Parsons, the CRE's chief executive; Maggie Semple, director of education of the New Millenium Experience Co; and Richard Stone, chairman of the Lord Ashdown charitable trust. The home office minister, Mike O'Brien, last night said that the government had made it clear from the beginning that it could not offer substantial financial support for the conference, but that the CRE had asked for extra money on January 11. The home office called in \"forensic accountants\" to examine the affairs of the company.

He said he had asked the incoming chairman of the CRE, Gurbux Singh, to hold an urgent inquiry into what went wrong. Mr Purkiss said last night: \"With hindsight, the assumption that the event could be funded through a combination of private sponsorship and delegates' fees was unrealistic. \"I can understand why the home office was not prepared to allow substantial public funding to go into GCDC 2000 Ltd once the true state of the company's affairs were apparent to us all.\" The prime minister, in an endorsement of the congress, had said he was heartened by \"the opportunity that this congress will provide for Britain to share our unique achievements in this area with the rest of the world.\" The initiative for the Cardiff event came from Sir Herman, who decided that it would be a good idea to bring the congress to Britain after attending its last meeting in Australia three years ago.

More than 5,000 people are waiting in the UK, but in the whole of last year there were 746 donors - the lack being partly due to the drop in road accident deaths and strokes.

      "body": "<p>A record number of black and Asian officers are now working for the Metropolitan Police following a successful recruitment drive in the wake of the damning Macpherson report last year, the force announced yesterday.There has also been a massive surge in the number of racist incidents reported to the police, the number of racist crimes solved and signs that rank and file officers are regaining their confidence to use stop and search powers. </p> <p>Sir John Stevens, the commissioner, said there was strong evidence the force had changed and \"was not the same Met as 12 months ago\". </p> <p>\"It has not been easy. It has taken some longer than others to face up to their responsibilities. We are determined to go beyond this and turn the Met into a truly anti-racist police service.\" </p> <p>Last week in an interview with the Guardian to mark the anniversary of his report into the Stephen Lawrence murder inquiry, Sir William Macpherson said the Met had to stop \"whining and complaining\" and get on with restructuring and reforming. </p> <p>Yesterday Sir John indicated he agreed. He said he was interested in being positive, and intended to give credit where credit was due. </p> <p>Although the Met is still a long way off the ten year target for ethnic recruitment set by the Home Secretary Jack Straw last April, it has managed to take on 184 extra black and Asian officers since last year, bringing the total to 1049 - about four per cent of the workforce. </p> <p>The increase came despite the swingeing criticism of the Met in the aftermath of the report and a crisis in overall recruitment. Last month the Met revealed that it needed to recruit 180 officers a month to keep up to strength, but recent figures were 108, 89 and 85. </p> <p>Assistant commissioner Denis O'Connor and deputy assistant commissioner John Grieve, head of the Racial and Violent Crimes Task Force, described how the number of racial incidents reported to the police had shot up by 175 per cent to 17,660 since last year. The number of racially motivated crimes has risen by 188 per cent to 15,620 and the clear up rate for race crimes has soared by 198 per cent to 3,755. </p> <p>Mr Grieve said the doommongers who predicted that ethnic minority communities would not trust the police enough to report race crimes had been proved wrong. \"The figures have gone through the roof. People obviously have confidence in what we are trying to do.\" </p> <p>Sir William made 70 recommendations in his report, and 39 were aimed directly at the Met.

      "bodyText": "A record number of black and Asian officers are now working for the Metropolitan Police following a successful recruitment drive in the wake of the damning Macpherson report last year, the force announced yesterday.There has also been a massive surge in the number of racist incidents reported to the police, the number of racist crimes solved and signs that rank and file officers are regaining their confidence to use stop and search powers. Sir John Stevens, the commissioner, said there was strong evidence the force had changed and \"was not the same Met as 12 months ago\". \"It has not been easy. It has taken some longer than others to face up to their responsibilities. We are determined to go beyond this and turn the Met into a truly anti-racist police service.\" Last week in an interview with the Guardian to mark the anniversary of his report into the Stephen Lawrence murder inquiry, Sir William Macpherson said the Met had to stop \"whining and complaining\" and get on with restructuring and reforming. Yesterday Sir John indicated he agreed. He said he was interested in being positive, and intended to give credit where credit was due. Although the Met is still a long way off the ten year target for ethnic recruitment set by the Home Secretary Jack Straw last April, it has managed to take on 184 extra black and Asian officers since last year, bringing the total to 1049 - about four per cent of the workforce. The increase came despite the swingeing criticism of the Met in the aftermath of the report and a crisis in overall recruitment. Last month the Met revealed that it needed to recruit 180 officers a month to keep up to strength, but recent figures were 108, 89 and 85. Assistant commissioner Denis O'Connor and deputy assistant commissioner John Grieve, head of the Racial and Violent Crimes Task Force, described how the number of racial incidents reported to the police had shot up by 175 per cent to 17,660 since last year. The number of racially motivated crimes has risen by 188 per cent to 15,620 and the clear up rate for race crimes has soared by 198 per cent to 3,755. Mr Grieve said the doommongers who predicted that ethnic minority communities would not trust the police enough to report race crimes had been proved wrong. \"The figures have gone through the roof. People obviously have confidence in what we are trying to do.\" Sir William made 70 recommendations in his report, and 39 were aimed directly at the Met. Sir John said 25 had been implemented already and the remainder were in hand. \"We've still a long way to go to fully regain the confidence of all Londoners. But we have taken a lead in this country in encouraging advice from our communities and closer scrutiny of everything we do.\" The Monitoring Group, which helps race attack victims in west London, said the rise in racial incidents was due to a post-Macpherson \"backlash\", targeted mainly at refugees who had just arrived in the country. Spokesman Suresh Grover added: \"Victims are galvanised by the example set by the Lawrences, but they don't expect anything by going to the police. The increase in the figures is also because police are following the definition of a racial incident as laid down by Macpherson, which provides truer recording of the actual figure.\"",

      "bodyText": "Frank Dobson today suggested that the government should not give way to the Lords on the row over whether all candidates in the London mayoral race should be entitled to a free mailshot. Labour's official mayoral candidate told the government and the Lords to thrash out a \"common sense solution\" to the row, after the Lords last night defeated the government's plans for the May 4 election. \"I do not think most Londoners would want to spend 15 million quid on a mailshot,\" he said. Ministers have warned that the Lords' amendment to the Greater London assembly bill could delay the election of a mayor and members of the new Greater London assembly. While the government claimed it could cost \u00a315m-\u00a330m, there is speculation that the government has so far refused to countenance the free mailshot, partly because it would offer encouragement to Ken Livingstone to stand as an independent against Mr Dobson. The current impasse is also believed to be preventing Mr Livingstone announcing any decision on whether or not he will join the mayoral race. Liberal Democrat hopeful Susan Kramer called it another government \"slip-up\" in the election and said that in the votes for both the Scottish and Welsh devolved assemblies there had been a free mailing. \"I think Londoners deserve the same treatment as anyone in Scotland,\" she added. Meanwhile, gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell resigned from the Labour party in protest at what he called the \"rigging\" of the London mayoral selection, which elected Frank Dobson by a narrow margin on Sunday. In a letter to prime minister Tony Blair, Mr Tatchell, the Labour candidate for Bermondsey in a 1983 byelection, said that after 22 years as a member he could no longer be in a party which \"has contempt for democracy and its own members\". He added: \"The rigging of the London mayoral candidate selection is the latest, unforgivable abuse of the democratic process. \"It follows similar gerrymandering in the selection of the Labour candidates for the Scottish and Welsh elections, and your plans to pack the House of Lords with unelected, unaccountable cronies and back-scratchers.\" He added: \"I have stuck with the Labour party through thick and thin over the last two decades. \"I bit my lip and stayed loyal through the progressive abandonment of socialist values and policies.

      "body": "<p><strong>TP:</strong> Now both our guests tonight are familiar with London. Norman Jewison and his wife Dixie lived here for 9 years. He even worked for the BBC - poor fellow - and Denzel Washington, whilst starring in For Queen and Country came to know the East End of London pretty well and even got a London accent before Gwyneth Paltrow! (Laughter). But tonight we're discussing The Hurricane, which is the life of a black man wrongly imprisoned and it is really the tale of his struggle for freedom. At the emotional heart of this film is the relationship between Rubin Carter and Lesra Martin. And I think it's current of course, we've had one or two interesting moments recently with heavy-weight champions in London [Mike Tyson's visit] but more importantly some of you will be aware of, amongst others, the M25 3 - young black men who've been imprisoned in this country for the last 11 years for a crime which certainly I believe they did not commit. </p> <p>On my right, Denzel Washington one of Hollywood's leading leading men. He and I have met before - we met in Columbus, Ohio where he gave me my very first award for television but the reason I went to Columbus, Ohio to meet him was because at the same time he gave me a lot of late night pleasure, as it were (Laughter. Denzel Washington moves his chair away from Trevor Phillips). He was starring as Dr Philip Chandler in St Elsewhere, okay! </p> <p>Amongst the many things that one can say about Denzel Washington - and we all know his filmography: the Oscar for Glory, Soldier's Story, Devil in a Blue Dress, and amongst his honours, including Best Actor a few days ago at the Berlin Film Festival (Applause), he has been voted the Sexiest Man Alive (Cheering).</p> <p>Norman Jewison is one of Hollywood's master story tellers. He started as an actor but is now a director who has, in a sense, specialised in bringing to us important stories, humanising them and making them available to a mass audience.</p> <p><strong> NJ:</strong> Are you going to say anything about my sexiness? (Laughter. Applause)</p> <p><strong> TP:</strong> I spoke to your wife (Laughter)... and she said she would do me serious damage if I mentioned any of that, so... </p> <p><strong> TP:</strong> Denzel, you've created a particular screen persona which could probably best be described as 'noble' and I wonder how it now feels to have become an icon who has this particular persona which comes through in all of your films: a guy who is basically moral and good... Is that part of what you hoped to do as an actor?</p> <p><strong> DW:</strong> Well, it is acting after all (Laughter). People have asked me, \"Do you do films to please certain groups of people, or are you concerned with what people will think, and has that influenced your choice of films?\" And the answer's \"No\". I just do what I feel and what I like. I don't necessarily censor or feel an obligation to have a particular moral standard - I'm willing to wallow in the mud, if necessary. It appears as if there seems to be a consistency in result, but maybe that has as much to do with the roles I choose as it does with how I play them. I do what pleases me. I honestly believe, and I've said it many times, that the universal stems from the specific and I can't walk around with a performance and ask everyone how they feel about it, but if noble is an opinion that people have I'll accept that. I've been asked many times why I don't play bad guys, or heavies, and I would do it, absolutely, in a second, just haven't been offered any so...(Laughter) if anybody has a script out there tonight I'm more than willing.</p> <p><strong> TP:</strong> You tried to buy the rights to Hurricane. What was it that attracted you to this particular story?</p> <p><strong> DW:</strong> John Ketcham, one of the producers of the film, brought the book, The Sixteenth Round, to my attention. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I just thought it was a fascinating and - in the case of this film - an incomplete book. I flew to Toronto immediately. I met with Rubin and his Canadian friends and I was expecting to meet this very angry and bitter man. I didn't. I met this sweet, little guy who will tell you to this day that he wouldn't change a thing; that everything that has happened to him has made him a better person, and made him the person that he is today. </p> <p><strong> TP:</strong> I don't know how much this is you or how much this is the character but clearly we are on Rubin Carter's side from beginning to end. But in reality Rubin Carter is a real human being and there are unattractive sides to him, which to some extent come out in the film: he is vain, he is angry and you can imagine at some point - when he shuts himself off in the prison, when he doesn't deal with people - he will come over as arrogant and unpleasant. How did you feel about that side of him? Could you get that side of him across? Or did you feel it unnecessary to deal with that?</p> <p><strong> DW:</strong> No, absolutely. In fact I could use more and that's maybe for selfish reasons. In the arc of a character, in building a character, since he ends up here somewhere (indicates high) in a lofty position then I would want to wallow down here even more in order to highlight that. One of the things that I said to Rubin when we sat down and talked for a while - after I'd figured out how much he weighed and the fact that I could run faster than he could (Laughter) - I said to him, \"Maybe you got exactly what you deserved\" and he said, \"I did\". There's a line in the film: \"Hate put me in prison and love got me out\". Well, I don't believe that it's just the hatred that was sent his way from different forces - police, the judicial system, whatever - I felt and I told him quite honestly that I thought it was the hatred in his own heart which put him in the position that he was in. Once I'd opened my eyes and stopped worrying about getting hit, he said \"You're right\". He was a mean, angry person. He was also living in a time where when you spoke about what you believed as a black man in America in the mid 60s it could cost you your life, as it did Malcolm X and many others. He was very much under the eye of the FBI and other organisations and he knew that and those forces were very powerful, but for me the journey was a personal journey. It's the story of his mental, if you will, but definitely spiritual, evolution and that's the way I attacked the role; that's what I was interested in as an actor.</p> <p><strong> TP:</strong> The story of the black athlete, particularly the boxer, who emerges from the ghetto is not an unfamiliar one. The previous example of this the Jack Johnson story. To what extent did you draw on that in thinking about how you were going to portray Rubin, because physically you changed your stance completely but actually there was there quite a lot of difference in there from how you normally are on screen?</p> <p><strong> DW:</strong> This was a different opportunity. This is a film that starts off with a left-hook and an angry man who's willing to destroy anyone who gets near him. I didn't think so much about those people: we all have it in us. We've all had some level of injustice, whether 20 years in prison, or 20 minutes sitting in your car waiting for a police officer to determine your future. Or even a few moments in an elevator with some woman clutching her purse thinking you're going to rob her \u00be regardless of celebrity, that has happened to me, nothing like what has happened to him has happened to me but I can relate. I've seen examples of it. In fact, the reason I'm in America is the result of it, so I understand that racism, I understand that's how America was founded, I understand that that history and hatred is passed down from generation to generation. I understand especially now because I'm a father of two sons and two daughters, so I use those kinds of things to fuel my own fire. And then I spent a lot of time just talking with Rubin and he walked me through his past and how those agencies and individuals affected him in his life. So I just related to the experiences I had and draw from the experiences he told me about to try and shape the character.</p> <p> <strong> TP:</strong> Norman Jewison, why did you choose this movie?</p> <p><strong> NJ:</strong> After reading The Sixteenth Round which is a eloquent plea for help and then listening to the Bob Dylan song over the years, everybody was aware - if you're over 40 years old - who The Hurricane was. I was never aware of the end of the story and the moment I was exposed to Lazarus and The Hurricane, which was the book written by the Canadian group, Terry Swinton and Sam Chaiton, I think that's what inspired me. I mean this is like a fairy tale, this is a miracle. Can you imagine? Here's a kid, Lesra Martin from Brooklyn, can't read or write, he's 15 years old, he's never read a book and he goes to a book sale at Toronto public library and he's told he can buy a book. What if didn't choose The Sixteenth Round, what if he hadn't picked up the book? Would Rubin still be in jail? Would he die there? The chances, the fate. I asked him, \"Why did you pick up the book?\" He said, \"I looked and I saw Rubin's face on the book, and I kind of identified and I picked the book up and I opened it up and there were some boxing pictures...\" and then I said, \"But you wrote Rubin a letter. Rubin has never answered any letters, hundreds of letters, he cut himself off from his family, from his friends, from any white person, he isolated himself in order to do the time\" [I asked Rubin] \"Why did you pick up the letter?\" and he said, \"Well, I looked at the stamp and it had the Queen of England on the stamp and I was curious, I guess\". He realised the letter was from Canada and he opened it up and what Lesra had written touched his heart and so he started to write this kid. And that's where it starts, that to me was the story that excited me because everything that Rubin was at that point was changed. It was like Lesra was like a ray of sunshine. You know when you lock an animal away from the sun, from the light, it's unnatural, they wither, they die. Every animal you see faces the sun, they lie facing the sun. We get energy from the sun. Turner, the great painter, said that God was the sun, God is light. And here was this man sitting in this cell in the dark and the kid became the sunlight, and I just got carried away with this whole idea. That's why I tried to tell the story through those two lives, rather than through the commune - there were nine people in the commune, and there was all kinds of lawyers and there was all kinds of people who helped Rubin and contributed, but I just wanted to concentrate on those two.</p> <p><strong> TP:</strong> What interested me and struck me very forcibly was this relationship which Denzel played with Vicellous Shannon [Lesra Martin] that was clearly the heart of the movie. To what extent did you think, as you were composing this, that actually here are two men and in some sense, for Rubin, Lesra might have been what he was but in the way the story is presented, and we see that Lesra at the end of the film becomes a lawyer in Vancouver, actually there are two different paths which are made available. Now to what extent was that a conscious motive in the movie - \"if you're going to get out of the ghetto you can read, or you can box?\" I'm putting it crudely, but...</p> <p> <strong> NJ:</strong> True. Each one is a choice. From what I could tell about Rubin, the fighting, I think, came when he learned how to box when he was in the army. When he came out and was arrested after he won his paratrooper wings, he was changed a certain amount. He was exposed to black pride, he was exposed to influences in the army which he felt affected him for the rest of his life, he was exposed to writings that he had never read before and to the Black Muslim movement. When he came out he robbed a woman's purse, he was up for assault, he was given 4 years in the penitentiary, he came out and that's when he built himself up into this fighting machine. But when he came out he was full of anger. Here was an angry, violent, powerful instrument who was going to make sure he was never going to jail again. But he knew he could do one thing: he could fight and he learned that at a very early age in Jamestown, which was a brutal, horrible place. People say [to me] \"I don't know whether you showed the rage [in the film]\" But I think all those scenes in solitary, when he's struggling with his own demons, when we show him struggling with his own rage, they're very powerful scenes. I think it's one of the best parts of the film for me and I think it's some of the best acting in the film, I think what Denzel did in those scenes is just brilliant. It's not too often in a film we see a character playing different parts and arguing with himself. This is pretty original stuff. I think Denzel's said what I felt the first time I met Rubin Carter. After I decided to direct the film I spent 4 or 5 hours with Rubin, we were walking in the woods and I was amazed, \"Where's the anger, where's the angst, where's the rage? God, you were locked away for 19 years for something you didn't do, your career was ruined, your family destroyed, why aren't you angry?\" and he said, \"Rage only consumes the vessel which contains it\". And I thought that's Buddha, that's Krishnamurti, this comes from years and years and years of submerging your own ego. I mean how many people do you get to meet who are like this? That's why he's so charismatic. I wish he was here tonight because he'd just amaze you with his understanding. He's a very spiritual person.</p> <p><strong> TP:</strong> This movie is presented as kind of the third of a trilogy - the others being In the Heat of the Night and A Soldier's Story, in which Denzel played the crucial role. To what extent did you do that consciously - it's very striking that in this movie Rod Steiger appears. I mean, he only appears for ten minutes but interestingly to my reading of it he plays almost exactly the same role - not the same character - but he does the same thing in the movie in that he accepts that there has been an injustice because he stands for the idea of the American Constitution and that defence of the idea of justice and the Constitution allows him to overcome his natural, ingrained prejudice. Now I may be giving an elaborate reading and you might not have thought about that in that way at all, but I'm interested in what extent you think these three films are part of the same story for you?</p> <p><strong> NJ:</strong> All three films deal in different ways with racial prejudice. Americans love to talk about the Constitution and how it protects the rights of every citizen and promises freedom to every citizen, but it's also a country based on racism and they don't talk about that too much and every time there's a film which deals with it there's certain parts of the country that feel uncomfortable. And yet I think it has to be dealt with and I've often thought if I was African-American going into a courtroom and I looked up I think my worst nightmare would be to see Rod Steiger sitting on the bench! (Laughter). So I told Rod, \"I think you're going to love this role\" (Laughter) He says, \"Well, I'm going to have to come in and save you again, kid!\"</p> <p><strong> TP:</strong> Are you going to be allowed back into Canada? I read that some people were slightly disturbed by your portrayal of Canadians as slightly bombed-out hippies?</p> <p><strong> NJ:</strong> Well, actually there was quite a group of them. I've had trouble before, listen, I made a film called The Russians are Coming and I went to Moscow and they wouldn't let me back in the United States (Laughter) so I've been through all that!</p>",

      "bodyText": "TP: Now both our guests tonight are familiar with London. Norman Jewison and his wife Dixie lived here for 9 years. He even worked for the BBC - poor fellow - and Denzel Washington, whilst starring in For Queen and Country came to know the East End of London pretty well and even got a London accent before Gwyneth Paltrow! (Laughter). But tonight we're discussing The Hurricane, which is the life of a black man wrongly imprisoned and it is really the tale of his struggle for freedom. At the emotional heart of this film is the relationship between Rubin Carter and Lesra Martin. And I think it's current of course, we've had one or two interesting moments recently with heavy-weight champions in London [Mike Tyson's visit] but more importantly some of you will be aware of, amongst others, the M25 3 - young black men who've been imprisoned in this country for the last 11 years for a crime which certainly I believe they did not commit. On my right, Denzel Washington one of Hollywood's leading leading men. He and I have met before - we met in Columbus, Ohio where he gave me my very first award for television but the reason I went to Columbus, Ohio to meet him was because at the same time he gave me a lot of late night pleasure, as it were (Laughter. Denzel Washington moves his chair away from Trevor Phillips). He was starring as Dr Philip Chandler in St Elsewhere, okay! Amongst the many things that one can say about Denzel Washington - and we all know his filmography: the Oscar for Glory, Soldier's Story, Devil in a Blue Dress, and amongst his honours, including Best Actor a few days ago at the Berlin Film Festival (Applause), he has been voted the Sexiest Man Alive (Cheering). Norman Jewison is one of Hollywood's master story tellers. He started as an actor but is now a director who has, in a sense, specialised in bringing to us important stories, humanising them and making them available to a mass audience. NJ: Are you going to say anything about my sexiness? (Laughter. Applause) TP: I spoke to your wife (Laughter)... and she said she would do me serious damage if I mentioned any of that, so... TP: Denzel, you've created a particular screen persona which could probably best be described as 'noble' and I wonder how it now feels to have become an icon who has this particular persona which comes through in all of your films: a guy who is basically moral and good... Is that part of what you hoped to do as an actor? DW: Well, it is acting after all (Laughter). People have asked me, \"Do you do films to please certain groups of people, or are you concerned with what people will think, and has that influenced your choice of films?\" And the answer's \"No\". I just do what I feel and what I like. I don't necessarily censor or feel an obligation to have a particular moral standard - I'm willing to wallow in the mud, if necessary. It appears as if there seems to be a consistency in result, but maybe that has as much to do with the roles I choose as it does with how I play them. I do what pleases me. I honestly believe, and I've said it many times, that the universal stems from the specific and I can't walk around with a performance and ask everyone how they feel about it, but if noble is an opinion that people have I'll accept that. I've been asked many times why I don't play bad guys, or heavies, and I would do it, absolutely, in a second, just haven't been offered any so...(Laughter) if anybody has a script out there tonight I'm more than willing. TP: You tried to buy the rights to Hurricane. What was it that attracted you to this particular story? DW: John Ketcham, one of the producers of the film, brought the book, The Sixteenth Round, to my attention. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I just thought it was a fascinating and - in the case of this film - an incomplete book. I flew to Toronto immediately. I met with Rubin and his Canadian friends and I was expecting to meet this very angry and bitter man. I didn't. I met this sweet, little guy who will tell you to this day that he wouldn't change a thing; that everything that has happened to him has made him a better person, and made him the person that he is today. TP: I don't know how much this is you or how much this is the character but clearly we are on Rubin Carter's side from beginning to end. But in reality Rubin Carter is a real human being and there are unattractive sides to him, which to some extent come out in the film: he is vain, he is angry and you can imagine at some point - when he shuts himself off in the prison, when he doesn't deal with people - he will come over as arrogant and unpleasant. How did you feel about that side of him? Could you get that side of him across? Or did you feel it unnecessary to deal with that? DW: No, absolutely. In fact I could use more and that's maybe for selfish reasons. In the arc of a character, in building a character, since he ends up here somewhere (indicates high) in a lofty position then I would want to wallow down here even more in order to highlight that. One of the things that I said to Rubin when we sat down and talked for a while - after I'd figured out how much he weighed and the fact that I could run faster than he could (Laughter) - I said to him, \"Maybe you got exactly what you deserved\" and he said, \"I did\". There's a line in the film: \"Hate put me in prison and love got me out\". Well, I don't believe that it's just the hatred that was sent his way from different forces - police, the judicial system, whatever - I felt and I told him quite honestly that I thought it was the hatred in his own heart which put him in the position that he was in. Once I'd opened my eyes and stopped worrying about getting hit, he said \"You're right\". He was a mean, angry person. He was also living in a time where when you spoke about what you believed as a black man in America in the mid 60s it could cost you your life, as it did Malcolm X and many others. He was very much under the eye of the FBI and other organisations and he knew that and those forces were very powerful, but for me the journey was a personal journey. It's the story of his mental, if you will, but definitely spiritual, evolution and that's the way I attacked the role; that's what I was interested in as an actor. TP: The story of the black athlete, particularly the boxer, who emerges from the ghetto is not an unfamiliar one. The previous example of this the Jack Johnson story. To what extent did you draw on that in thinking about how you were going to portray Rubin, because physically you changed your stance completely but actually there was there quite a lot of difference in there from how you normally are on screen? DW: This was a different opportunity. This is a film that starts off with a left-hook and an angry man who's willing to destroy anyone who gets near him. I didn't think so much about those people: we all have it in us. We've all had some level of injustice, whether 20 years in prison, or 20 minutes sitting in your car waiting for a police officer to determine your future. Or even a few moments in an elevator with some woman clutching her purse thinking you're going to rob her \u00be regardless of celebrity, that has happened to me, nothing like what has happened to him has happened to me but I can relate. I've seen examples of it. In fact, the reason I'm in America is the result of it, so I understand that racism, I understand that's how America was founded, I understand that that history and hatred is passed down from generation to generation. I understand especially now because I'm a father of two sons and two daughters, so I use those kinds of things to fuel my own fire. And then I spent a lot of time just talking with Rubin and he walked me through his past and how those agencies and individuals affected him in his life. So I just related to the experiences I had and draw from the experiences he told me about to try and shape the character. TP: Norman Jewison, why did you choose this movie? NJ: After reading The Sixteenth Round which is a eloquent plea for help and then listening to the Bob Dylan song over the years, everybody was aware - if you're over 40 years old - who The Hurricane was. I was never aware of the end of the story and the moment I was exposed to Lazarus and The Hurricane, which was the book written by the Canadian group, Terry Swinton and Sam Chaiton, I think that's what inspired me. I mean this is like a fairy tale, this is a miracle. Can you imagine? Here's a kid, Lesra Martin from Brooklyn, can't read or write, he's 15 years old, he's never read a book and he goes to a book sale at Toronto public library and he's told he can buy a book. What if didn't choose The Sixteenth Round, what if he hadn't picked up the book? Would Rubin still be in jail? Would he die there? The chances, the fate. I asked him, \"Why did you pick up the book?\" He said, \"I looked and I saw Rubin's face on the book, and I kind of identified and I picked the book up and I opened it up and there were some boxing pictures...\" and then I said, \"But you wrote Rubin a letter. Rubin has never answered any letters, hundreds of letters, he cut himself off from his family, from his friends, from any white person, he isolated himself in order to do the time\" [I asked Rubin] \"Why did you pick up the letter?\" and he said, \"Well, I looked at the stamp and it had the Queen of England on the stamp and I was curious, I guess\". He realised the letter was from Canada and he opened it up and what Lesra had written touched his heart and so he started to write this kid. And that's where it starts, that to me was the story that excited me because everything that Rubin was at that point was changed. It was like Lesra was like a ray of sunshine. You know when you lock an animal away from the sun, from the light, it's unnatural, they wither, they die. Every animal you see faces the sun, they lie facing the sun. We get energy from the sun. Turner, the great painter, said that God was the sun, God is light. And here was this man sitting in this cell in the dark and the kid became the sunlight, and I just got carried away with this whole idea. That's why I tried to tell the story through those two lives, rather than through the commune - there were nine people in the commune, and there was all kinds of lawyers and there was all kinds of people who helped Rubin and contributed, but I just wanted to concentrate on those two.

Upon receipt of the Fiver - the first 50 individuals to ENTER this month's game win 1 share!</p> <p><strong>HOW SKIVING STARS COULD EARN THEIR LYING STRIPES</strong></p> <p>Celestine Babayaro and Nwankwo Kanu have finally returned to Chelsea and Arsenal respectively. Both went AWOL for 10 days after Nigeria's traumatic penalty-shoot out defeat in the Africans Nations Cup final and both face fat fines of up to \u00a350,000 from their clubs unless they can come up with more convincing alibis for their absence than \"my Brooklyn's got gastro-enteritis\". What can they try?</p> <p>\"Sorry gaffer, I've caught an exotic foreign disease.\" Oh dear, Babayaro's sister tried that one. Chelsea's assistant manager Gwyn Williams wasn't impressed: \"He [Babayaro] hasn't got malaria, that is just rubbish. All I'll say is that he is fit and well and he is back in training today.\"</p> <p>\"Excuse me boss, but there was serious civil unrest in Nigeria and it wasn't safe for me to leave the jacuzzi.\" Babayaro's guardian attempted something along these lines and Kanu might feel it could work for him. David Beckham must be ruing the day he moved to Hertfordshire; if he had only set up home in Moss Side he could claim something similar.</p> <p>\"I had extremely bad diarrhoea for 10 days and couldn't get on a plane.\" It might work if Kanu or Babayaro's boss was Alex Ferguson, a man who understands more than most how bowel movements affect travel arrangements.</p> <p>\"I developed a sudden phobia of flying and had to travel from Lagos to the Isle of Dogs on a pedalo.\" This could be the winner for Kanu - after all, it gets Dennis Bergkamp several breaks a season.</p> <p><strong>LIVE AND KICKING</strong></p> <p>England v Argentina and Republic of Ireland v Czech Republic.

OK, they're live on Sky as well, but this is much better.</p> <p><strong>A TURN FOR THE WORSE (AGAIN)</strong></p> <p>When things aren't going well, sometimes you have to hit the very bottom before you can turn things around. Take Celtic for example. Their nadir came when they were dumped out of the Scottish Cup by Inverness Caley Thistle, but since then they have won at Dundee - yes! - closed the gap on arch-rivals Rangers to eight points - alright! - made the League Cup final - woohoo! - and several sources have reported that star striker Mark Viduka is on his way to AC Milan ... oh well, it was looking good for a while.</p> <p>According to the Daily Record, Vicenzo Morabito (who describes himself as a 'super-agent' - \"Is it a bung? Is it a bag of used tenners under a table in a motorway service station? No, it's Super-agent!\") is a mere couple of weeks away from completing an \u00a38m transfer on Viduka's behalf to a large club in Italy. \"A club have approached me about Mark but they do not want to be in the papers until there is something more concrete,\" prattled the all-action businessman. Luckily, he said nothing at all about web sites, so Teamtalk was free to confirm that the Celtic hitman will be off to the rossoneri sooner than you can say 'Luther Blissett'.</p> <p>However, Viduka's adviser, IMG, has denied that any transfer will take place, and suggested that our comic-book character is simply chancing his arm. \"We have never done business with Morabito and we never will,\" insisted IMG's Claes Elefalk. A disillusioned Fiver doesn't know what to believe now - things have come to a pretty pass if you can't take a super-agent at his word.</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"Unless he knows something which is completely beyond our ken, he has picked an XI who would have a hard time beating Aston Villa, let alone Argentina.\" - Jeff Powell of the Daily Mail on Kelvin Koogan's England side.

      "bodyText": "DO THIS VERY QUICKLY Win a share in www.kamikazefootball.com! Upon receipt of the Fiver - the first 50 individuals to ENTER this month's game win 1 share! HOW SKIVING STARS COULD EARN THEIR LYING STRIPES Celestine Babayaro and Nwankwo Kanu have finally returned to Chelsea and Arsenal respectively. Both went AWOL for 10 days after Nigeria's traumatic penalty-shoot out defeat in the Africans Nations Cup final and both face fat fines of up to \u00a350,000 from their clubs unless they can come up with more convincing alibis for their absence than \"my Brooklyn's got gastro-enteritis\". What can they try? \"Sorry gaffer, I've caught an exotic foreign disease.\" Oh dear, Babayaro's sister tried that one. Chelsea's assistant manager Gwyn Williams wasn't impressed: \"He [Babayaro] hasn't got malaria, that is just rubbish. All I'll say is that he is fit and well and he is back in training today.\" \"Excuse me boss, but there was serious civil unrest in Nigeria and it wasn't safe for me to leave the jacuzzi.\" Babayaro's guardian attempted something along these lines and Kanu might feel it could work for him. David Beckham must be ruing the day he moved to Hertfordshire; if he had only set up home in Moss Side he could claim something similar. \"I had extremely bad diarrhoea for 10 days and couldn't get on a plane.\" It might work if Kanu or Babayaro's boss was Alex Ferguson, a man who understands more than most how bowel movements affect travel arrangements. \"I developed a sudden phobia of flying and had to travel from Lagos to the Isle of Dogs on a pedalo.\" This could be the winner for Kanu - after all, it gets Dennis Bergkamp several breaks a season. LIVE AND KICKING England v Argentina and Republic of Ireland v Czech Republic. Both are being covered live at http://www.footballunlimited.co.uk. OK, they're live on Sky as well, but this is much better. A TURN FOR THE WORSE (AGAIN) When things aren't going well, sometimes you have to hit the very bottom before you can turn things around. Take Celtic for example. Their nadir came when they were dumped out of the Scottish Cup by Inverness Caley Thistle, but since then they have won at Dundee - yes! - closed the gap on arch-rivals Rangers to eight points - alright! - made the League Cup final - woohoo! - and several sources have reported that star striker Mark Viduka is on his way to AC Milan ... oh well, it was looking good for a while. According to the Daily Record, Vicenzo Morabito (who describes himself as a 'super-agent' - \"Is it a bung? Is it a bag of used tenners under a table in a motorway service station? No, it's Super-agent!\") is a mere couple of weeks away from completing an \u00a38m transfer on Viduka's behalf to a large club in Italy. \"A club have approached me about Mark but they do not want to be in the papers until there is something more concrete,\" prattled the all-action businessman. Luckily, he said nothing at all about web sites, so Teamtalk was free to confirm that the Celtic hitman will be off to the rossoneri sooner than you can say 'Luther Blissett'. However, Viduka's adviser, IMG, has denied that any transfer will take place, and suggested that our comic-book character is simply chancing his arm. \"We have never done business with Morabito and we never will,\" insisted IMG's Claes Elefalk. A disillusioned Fiver doesn't know what to believe now - things have come to a pretty pass if you can't take a super-agent at his word. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"Unless he knows something which is completely beyond our ken, he has picked an XI who would have a hard time beating Aston Villa, let alone Argentina.\" - Jeff Powell of the Daily Mail on Kelvin Koogan's England side. Worried yet? GABRIEL GABS They've been trying to sign him for years. So now that he's 31 (in striker's years, just about to tip over the top of a very steep hill) Gabriel Batistuta has declared that he wants to sign for Manchester United. Fergie must be chuffed that his club are being treated like Middlesbrough, eh? \"I really want to play for United because they are the best club in the world right now,\" said the Argentinian, in no way trying to annoy the hell out of world champions Corinthians from arch-rivals Brazil. \"Besides being a very cool club,\" he continued, missing the point completely, \"it would be nice to play in the Premiership and have the experience of English life.\" Sounds promising for United - and it sounds like Batigol is indeed serious. \"I'm taking English lessons,\" he proudly smiled, pushing out his chest. Well, then, you're halfway there, Gabriel. Now all you need to do is brush up on how to invade a referee's personal body space while making all the veins on your forehead bulge out and you're in. THE RUMOUR MILL Liverpool are interested in AEK Athens striker Demis Nikolaidis. Gerard Houllier wants the \u00a35m-rated Greek international on loan until the end of the season. Rangers have reportedly signed AZ Alkmaar's Dutch right-back Fernando Ricksen for \u00a33m. But Opta Soccer claim that Coventry will launch a \u00a33.5m counter-bid. Arsenal are close to signing Marseille winger Robert Pires as replacement for Barca-bound Marc Overmars. NEWS IN BRIEF Paul Scholes has been voted England's player of the year for 1999 by the England Members' Club. Jorge Cadete has finally joined Bradford after passing his medical. He should debut against Aston Villa at Valley Parade on Saturday. Dundee United's Scottish Cup quarter-final against Inverness Caledonian Thistle or Aberdeen at Tannadice will be screened live on BBC Scotland on Sunday, March 12 at 3pm. BSkyB will screen the eagerly-anticipated clash between Rangers and Hearts at Ibrox, also on March 12, from 6.05pm. Aberdeen have abandoned plans to enter the InterToto Cup this summer.

The cult of the superstar Asian cricketer is such that captaincy is part of the inheritance. But great players too rarely make good captains; far better for them to inspire their teammates with deeds rather than words.</p> <p>Already Wasim is transformed: once more a giant on the field, and no longer a shackled player and befuddled captain. The same will happen to Sachin, on home wickets and with the burden of captaincy to be lifted he will once more display the sweet science of batting.</p> <p>But their resignations are only half the battle. There are few viable alternatives in this crucial phase of regeneration, and Pakistan have already got it wrong. Saeed Anwar will be crushed by the captaincy rather than emboldened by it.

      "bodyText": "Easy rests the head that wears no crown. No thoughts of bowling changes, field placings, man-management, and that awful spectre of defeat. Wasim Akram and Sachin Tendulkar are now free to do what they do best: win matches with bat and ball. Resigning is never easy - it's an admission of personal failure. Why not hang on a little longer, it must be tempting to think, it might all turn rosy? But for these two, possibly the greatest players their nations have ever produced, it would not have been a happy outcome. Captaincy was ruining their joie de vivre and blunting their potency. It was brave, and right, of them to step down. It will add to their greatness, not diminish it. \"We didn't do it,\" say the cricket boards. \"Our star captains chose to go.\" This is truer of Sachin than Wasim, but at least they both managed to retain their dignity. The cult of the superstar Asian cricketer is such that captaincy is part of the inheritance. But great players too rarely make good captains; far better for them to inspire their teammates with deeds rather than words. Already Wasim is transformed: once more a giant on the field, and no longer a shackled player and befuddled captain. The same will happen to Sachin, on home wickets and with the burden of captaincy to be lifted he will once more display the sweet science of batting. But their resignations are only half the battle. There are few viable alternatives in this crucial phase of regeneration, and Pakistan have already got it wrong. Saeed Anwar will be crushed by the captaincy rather than emboldened by it. His last spell in charge was notable for negative tactics. Imran Khan even advised him to be more aggressive this time around. On sumptuous batting tracks Saeed responded by putting Sri Lanka in to bat in all three one-day games - and lost the lot. Not quite the positive signal that was needed. Meanwhile his form is waning.

One of the grown-up people, my wife Angie, stays upstairs for a while with the small, gurgling, malodorous one, who is our daughter Estelle. The other grown-up person - me - runs up and down the stairs, in and out of the kitchen, and back and forth along the hall to ensure that the three intermediate-sized people who've doubled our numbers are a) getting ready for school, and b) having a better time doing it than they have at their \"other home\", where their mother Dilys takes exclusive charge of morning matters. This is so that their \"other dad\", as Chris the Pillock is now dutifully described, can devour for his breakfast the head of the crazed crocodile, rhinoceros or grizzly bear he wrestled the previous evening then ritually slaughtered out of a fellow warrior's respect for that spirit of the wild with which desert-booted, self-made IT consultants have such a powerful affinity. </p> <p>You are now probably expecting me to say: \"OK, I made that last bit up.\" And it had crossed my mind. But, frankly, the more the three intermediate-sized people, Gloria, Jed and Billy, let slip about the regime at their \"other home\", the more convinced I am that nothing can be ruled out. Also, I rather like the idea that Chris hides from the bad moods and mayhem that dominate beginnings to the days. It reaffirms my sometimes faltering faith that no matter how much Dilys tries to make things otherwise, Chris can never replicate the bond between Gloria, Jed, Billy and me, a bond that becomes so apparent first thing on weekdays as I scrabble about in my housecoat and fluffy slippers with a roll-up hanging from my bottom lip. </p> <p>OK, I made that last bit up. But there's plenty to be said for sluttishness in a part-time dad when his place in the affection of his part-time kids is under threat. Empathy is the key, and my kids are the biggest sluts of all. Each has their own style. Gloria really works at hers. Fast approaching 12, she's discovered glitter nail paint and hair colour in a can, both of which she applies in hallucinogenic quantities as soon as she's awake. When she descends from her toxic boudoir she looks like the Maddest Tart in Trollop City. </p> <p>And do you know what? I feel so proud! Of myself, you understand, for letting her go to school looking such a fright, especially in the knowledge that her mother doesn't allow it. I know this because Gloria disclosed as much to Angie, and Angie, being a good stepmum, immediately told me. Dilys says purple hair is \"not appropriate\". Not appropriate! Hah! All the more reason to encourage it! At least one of us knows where true parental duty lies. On the step the other day as she prepared to leave I said to Gloria: \"Remember this, big daughter: you are not only the wittiest, cleverest, coolest girl in all the world but also the most beautiful.\" </p> <p>\"Thanks Dad, er Joe.\" </p> <p>\"Er Dad, will do,\" I smiled. </p> <p>She smiled, too. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Jed and Billy had been joined at breakfast by Estelle. Wedged into her usual precarious position between her two half-brothers, she stuck a finger in her Ready Brek, then stuck it up her nose. Then stuck it in her mouth. Then forgot about the Ready Brek and stuck it up her nose again. Then in her mouth again. I placed my hands upon my hips and affected indignation. </p> <p>\"Oi, Stell, please don't do that. Other people might want some too.\" </p> <p>Jed and Billy looked at me, amazed. What was that I'd said? </p> <p>\"What about your brothers?\" I continued. \"If you eat all the snot there won't be any left for their bogey butties.\" </p> <p>\"Ugh, sick!\" Billy squealed, clutching at his belly and rolling off his seat on to the floor. </p> <p>\"Ugh, sick!\" echoed Jed, doing the same, more animated than he'd been for months. </p> <p>Angie had to hurry off to work. I kissed her. I squeezed her. I told her that I totally adored her. Then I bundled Jed, Billy and Estelle out of the door. As we shambled down the street, the boys chattered on in awe of my performance in the kitchen. </p> <p>\"Bogey butties!

Also, it can be nice for your children to see where you work, so taking them in occasionally has its benefits: my six-year-old is always asking me when she can come and see where I work.

I can see it's not a good idea to have babies in some parts of the Commons, but I don't think taking them into the tea rooms or voting chamber in an emergency would be a big problem. <br>Verdict: Sometimes</p> <p> <strong> Anna Reece</strong> Head of communications, Inst of Personnel and Development <br> </p> <p> The working environment is rarely designed to accommodate children, and they can be disruptive. They take their parent's mind off their job - you can't concentrate on a task with your child there in the background - and they distract your colleagues, too. Often it's a recipe for complete disaster, as in the film Mary Poppins, where the children get taken to the bank for the day. It affects productivity all round - often people will take their children in because their childcare has fallen through, but overall they might be reducing the total output of their office that day if they do go in with children. <br>Verdict: No</p> <p><strong> Sharon Mears</strong> Widowed mother with an 11-year-old son <br> </p> <p>I'm bringing up my son on my own and I've got no family around me. If anything goes wrong with my childcare arrangements, I'm caught in a dilemma: do I leave the colleagues in the lurch in the magazine office where I work, with deadlines to meet, or do I go in and take my son with me? I've done it when I've had to, although of course I don't think an office is the right environment for him and he gets bored. It's a question of the lesser of two evils. The people I work with are brilliant about it, but it makes me feel guilty: I feel he's distracting other people, and that I'm not working as much as I should be. <br>Verdict: Yes, in extremis</p> <p> <strong> Sue Nickson</strong> Head of the employment unit at lawyers Hamond Suddards <br> </p> <p>Unless they have specific provision for it, workplaces are no place for a child. Technically, you shouldn't even bring your new baby into the office to show off to your colleagues, although of course lots of people do. But it's a breach of health and safety regulations, and thus there's no insurance cover in case anything untoward happens. I can see why people are tempted to bring their children into work at half term, but it really isn't a good idea - employers should talk to their employees to find out what they need so that the question of bringing in children won't apply. <br>Verdict: No</p>",

I can see it's not a good idea to have babies in some parts of the Commons, but I don't think taking them into the tea rooms or voting chamber in an emergency would be a big problem. Verdict: Sometimes Anna Reece Head of communications, Inst of Personnel and Development The working environment is rarely designed to accommodate children, and they can be disruptive. They take their parent's mind off their job - you can't concentrate on a task with your child there in the background - and they distract your colleagues, too. Often it's a recipe for complete disaster, as in the film Mary Poppins, where the children get taken to the bank for the day. It affects productivity all round - often people will take their children in because their childcare has fallen through, but overall they might be reducing the total output of their office that day if they do go in with children. Verdict: No Sharon Mears Widowed mother with an 11-year-old son I'm bringing up my son on my own and I've got no family around me. If anything goes wrong with my childcare arrangements, I'm caught in a dilemma: do I leave the colleagues in the lurch in the magazine office where I work, with deadlines to meet, or do I go in and take my son with me? I've done it when I've had to, although of course I don't think an office is the right environment for him and he gets bored. It's a question of the lesser of two evils. The people I work with are brilliant about it, but it makes me feel guilty: I feel he's distracting other people, and that I'm not working as much as I should be. Verdict: Yes, in extremis Sue Nickson Head of the employment unit at lawyers Hamond Suddards Unless they have specific provision for it, workplaces are no place for a child. Technically, you shouldn't even bring your new baby into the office to show off to your colleagues, although of course lots of people do. But it's a breach of health and safety regulations, and thus there's no insurance cover in case anything untoward happens. I can see why people are tempted to bring their children into work at half term, but it really isn't a good idea - employers should talk to their employees to find out what they need so that the question of bringing in children won't apply. Verdict: No",

Parents around the country breathed a collective sigh of relief: so our grannies were right, after all, when they said things like \"outdoors dirt is good dirt\". We began whisking our children round open farms in droves. Then the awful story of Tom Dowling hit the headlines. Tom, now aged six, caught E coli from an infant school visit to a farm near St Albans in 1997. He survived, but he's unable to move his limbs and can only communicate by blinking. Farm dirt, it seems, might not be so healthy after all. </p> <p>This is certainly the conclusion reached by professor Hugh Pennington. This week he said on BBC1's Countryfile programme that he would \"go to the extreme of saying that perhaps it is unwise to take a five- or under-five-year-old on a farm visit because we have had such complications in the very small number of kids who've been infected\". Pennington should know what he's talking about. He's a leading expert on the E coli 0157 bug and headed the inquiry into the Lanarkshire E coli outbreak in 1996-7, which killed 21 people. </p> <p>So, am I risking my one-year-old daughter's life by letting her pet the goats? John Newton-Jones, chairman of the National Association of Farms for Schools, says I'm not, \"providing the farm is properly managed and your child is carefully supervised\". Fear of infection from farms should be put in perspective, he says. \"There are risks of infection wherever we take our children, whether it's to a farm, the countryside, the beach or a public park. A massive range of animals and birds, including seagulls, can carry the E coli bug\". Luckily, the key to avoiding it is simple: hygiene. </p> <p>As long as they wash their hands thoroughly, under running water after touching the animals, and as long as the farm is run to basic safety and hygiene standards, the risks to your children of catching E coli on a farm will be minuscule. </p> <p>This is because E coli is transmitted through the mouth. A spokesperson for the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) explains how it works: \"E coli 0157 is a particular strain of the bug that tends to cause the food poisoning outbreaks. It is transmitted by the 'faecal-oral route' and is often carried by animals.\" Crudely speaking, then, it goes like this: my little one strokes the goat. The goat happens to have a tiny (maybe even invisible) bit of goat poo on its fur. She then sucks her fingers, thus consuming the goat poo particle. In most cases, no harm will be done at all. But if the goat happens to be infected with the E coli bug, as some goats are, then she could become seriously ill and even die. If, though, I wash her hands carefully before she sucks them, the bug will never get into her system. </p> <p>This all sounds straightforward. But Pennington's E coli warning somehow lingers. Most of us think of farmyards as wholesome places where our red-cheeked children will breathe fresh air and cuddle sheep. We don't think of them as places where they could catch a virulent killer bug. </p> <p>In an average year, according to PHLS, there'll be 1,000 cases of E coli in England and Wales. Last year, 24 of those were because of farm visits (there was none in 1998). This may sound significant, but according to the National Farmer's Union, 14m people visited open farms last year. And statistically, you're far more likely to catch a nasty bug by eating an animal than by touching one: salmonella food poisoning infects 23,000 in an average year. </p> <p>It's also worth remembering that the people who run these farms are in general doing their best to make them safe. This isn't necessarily down to good will. Open farms are good business at a time when many farmers are struggling to keep afloat. What's more, the government has guidelines and carries out inspections: these farms can be closed down if they aren't deemed safe. </p> <p>The National Association of Farms for Schools (NAFS) has drawn up a charter of good practice that all members must adhere to (this will be posted at the farm's entry). NAFS also carries out random checks on its members. These go hand in hand with regular inspections by either the Health and Safety Executive (for working farms that are also open to the public) or the relevant local authority (for farms set up specifically for visitors). </p> <p>The HSE issues guidelines to all open farms and to schools, giving important safety rules. These are the basis for all inspections. Newton-Jones, who also runs his own \"farm park\" in Wrexham, North Wales, is convinced that these safeguards work: \"Provided proper precautions are put in place, we're quite happy that under-fives can safely visit farms.\" </p> <p>But guidelines aren't the law and we all know that inspections can miss things. As the solicitor representing Tom Dowling's parents put it last month, \"It's one thing to have guidelines. It's another to see that they are enforced.\" </p> <p>These warnings are a stark reminder of how important hygiene is. But the benefits of taking children to see animals are huge. \"It's a real life learning experience,\" says the NFU. \"It's an amazing chance for children to experience things first hand, rather than looking at a blackboard,\" says Newton-Jones. Certainly, watching my baby daughter encounter a goat for the first time was memorable for me. And it won't be her last chance either: I'll be taking her to farms in future. One thing's for sure, though: no goat poo's going anywhere near her mouth. </p> <p>\u0095 If the farm you visit is sticking to the rules, your route will be clearly marked and areas not for public access will be sealed off. It shouldn't be hard to find washing facilities - they must be clearly signposted - and the cafe, or eating area, will be separate from the bit with animals in it. </p> <p>If your child is going to a farm on a school trip, the teachers should be vigilant and informed. They must stick to HSE guidelines; this means, for example, only letting children eat in the designated area and watching to stop them from sucking their fingers, crayons or pencils as they wander round petting animals. They also need to make sure open wounds - grazed knees, for instance - are covered up and that all hands are properly scrubbed under running water before eating, or leaving the farm. </p> <p> \"We're confident,\" says HSE, \"that if these guidelines are followed, the risks of catching E coli will be minimised\".</p>",

The National Association of Farms for Schools (NAFS) has drawn up a charter of good practice that all members must adhere to (this will be posted at the farm's entry). NAFS also carries out random checks on its members. These go hand in hand with regular inspections by either the Health and Safety Executive (for working farms that are also open to the public) or the relevant local authority (for farms set up specifically for visitors). The HSE issues guidelines to all open farms and to schools, giving important safety rules. These are the basis for all inspections. Newton-Jones, who also runs his own \"farm park\" in Wrexham, North Wales, is convinced that these safeguards work: \"Provided proper precautions are put in place, we're quite happy that under-fives can safely visit farms.\" But guidelines aren't the law and we all know that inspections can miss things. As the solicitor representing Tom Dowling's parents put it last month, \"It's one thing to have guidelines. It's another to see that they are enforced.\" These warnings are a stark reminder of how important hygiene is. But the benefits of taking children to see animals are huge. \"It's a real life learning experience,\" says the NFU. \"It's an amazing chance for children to experience things first hand, rather than looking at a blackboard,\" says Newton-Jones. Certainly, watching my baby daughter encounter a goat for the first time was memorable for me. And it won't be her last chance either: I'll be taking her to farms in future. One thing's for sure, though: no goat poo's going anywhere near her mouth. \u0095 If the farm you visit is sticking to the rules, your route will be clearly marked and areas not for public access will be sealed off. It shouldn't be hard to find washing facilities - they must be clearly signposted - and the cafe, or eating area, will be separate from the bit with animals in it. If your child is going to a farm on a school trip, the teachers should be vigilant and informed. They must stick to HSE guidelines; this means, for example, only letting children eat in the designated area and watching to stop them from sucking their fingers, crayons or pencils as they wander round petting animals. They also need to make sure open wounds - grazed knees, for instance - are covered up and that all hands are properly scrubbed under running water before eating, or leaving the farm. \"We're confident,\" says HSE, \"that if these guidelines are followed, the risks of catching E coli will be minimised\".",

      "body": "<p>When was the last time you were asked your opinion on something that mattered to you? General elections? They're only every four or five years. Local and European elections? Most people can't be bothered. Opinion polls or focus groups? You're more likely to read about one than take part. </p> <p>While much has been said about social exclusion, little attention has been given to the growing phenomenon of the politically excluded - those people who feel they are not represented in our political institutions and who lack the capacity or willingness to make their views heard. It is a condition particularly prevalent among the young, the poor and certain ethnic minority groups. And it is a condition whose effects go wider than its immediate victims. We all get less good government from a system dominated by the three Ms - middle aged, middle class, men. </p> <p>Like poverty, political exclusion is a particular affront to progressives. One of the big arguments between the left and right is about the relative merits of democracy and markets as systems for allocating social goods. While markets are dynamic, creative and appear to offer new choices every day, democracy is creaking, discredited and leaves many people feeling they have no choice. As they say: \"It doesn't matter who you vote for, the politicians always win.\" </p> <p>Something must be done. If the tribulations in Edinburgh, Cardiff and London teach us anything, it is surely that building new institutions is not sufficient to create a new political culture. Fundamentally, we have to recognise that traditional representative democracy must be enhanced by new ways of involving the public in decision making. </p> <p>Some change is already underway. A commitment to public involvement has been made a key part of Labour's modernising government agenda. The government has argued that to achieve their long-term policy objectives - such as improving local services and tackling social exclusion and crime - it is necessary to involve the public. </p> <p>Yet evidence suggests that government departments are carrying out public involvement exercises without developing a coherent cross-departmental approach. There are few opportunities for sharing or learning from best practice, or for pooling experience and expertise across central and local government. </p> <p>We need to develop more coordinated methods - from opinion polls to citizens' juries - of involving the public in decision making, not as alternatives but as complementary to the traditional process. Elected representatives are there to make the difficult decisions. They have experience, access to the necessary expertise and, once elected, should have the legitimacy to govern. But the space on the ballot paper is all. You can place a cross, but you can't write: \"I like my local school, but my mother's lost her home help and I'm worried about street crime.\" Politicians need to be listening and to be showing that they are. </p> <p>This principle is not exclusive to politics. As a nation, we have a poor track record in engaging the general public in the process of change. Too often public involvement is mistaken for mere customer care - a market driven exercise used to refine a particular product or service. Increasingly, private sector bodies are making decisions in the public domain and are recognising the need to involve the public in a more meaningful way. As the government puts more emphasis on the engagement of the voluntary sector in service provision and regeneration, questions are being asked about whether this sector is any less guilty of high-handedness than the public alternative. </p> <p>Exercises in public involvement are vulnerable to three main criticisms: </p> <p>\u0095 The attempt at consultation is little more than an exercise in legitimising a decision already made. </p> <p>\u0095 Those engaged are not truly representative of the public, often because they are the peculiar kind of people who enjoy attending public meetings; </p> <p>\u0095 There remains a powerful imbalance of information between the agency consulting the citizens consulted, and the public. </p> <p>The main reason for these failings is that inclusive, meaningful public involvement is expensive, time consuming and challenging for those who undertake it. Those bodies which are really involving local communities in excellent and groundbreaking ways should be publicly lauded. There is a lot of good work going on, but the danger is that public involvement mechanisms could continue to grow in quantity yet decrease in quality, and consultation fatigue could easily set in among members of the public. Put simply, bad public involvement can often be worse than none at all. </p> <p>The Institute for Public Policy Research, a centre-left think tank, and the Guardian are together launching the Public Involvement Awards. Our premise is that high quality public involvement often goes unrecognised and that best practice is not always spread. </p> <p>These annual awards will publicise and celebrate the impact of successful public involvement. They will reward organisations that have put time and effort into undertaking meaningful consultation, but can also demonstrate that their policies or processes were significantly improved as a result. </p> <p>Any public, private or voluntary sector organisation that has shown a commitment to this principle is encouraged to take part in this award. Similarly, if you are an individual who has been consulted as part of the process of change, tell us about your experience - good or bad. Real choice is more than just being asked your choice from a set of pre-determined outcomes, more than about determining your own answers; it should empower you to change the questions. </p> <p>At its worst, public involvement is window dressing that will increase public cynicism. At its best, it could be a key plank in tackling political exclusion and improving the goods and services we receive. The Guardian/IPPR awards will aim for the best. </p> <p><strong> Cases proven</strong></p> <p><strong> Regulating the internet </strong></p> <p> To discover what a cross section of society thinks about internet regulation, the Independent Television Commission set up a citizens' forum, with 200 people recruited from a large mail-out in Birmingham. They represented all ages and walks of life: some used the internet daily, while others had never even touched a computer. For a day and a half the members of the forum debated the subject - helped by fact sheets, presentations and a panel of four diverse experts. Their opinions were assessed by monitoring these discussions and administering questionnaires before and after the forum. </p> <p>\u0095 lnternet Regulation: The Way Forward? is available on <a href=\"http://www.itc.org.uk\">www.itc.org.uk</a> or price \u00a35 from the ITC at 33 Foley Street, London Wl P 7LB </p> <p> <strong> Redeveloping the South Bank </strong><br> A major redevelopment of the South Bank site in London (stretching between Waterloo Bridge and County Hall) is currently being planned. </p> <p>The South Bank Centre (SBC) is currently running a massive and innovative consultation programme to involve all those with a stake in the site in the redevelopment, from visitors to residents to artists and performers. Working with Opinion Leader Research hundreds of people have become involved in projects, including: </p> <p>\u0095 A series of citizens' workshops with audiences, visitors, local residents and employees to establish the non-technical criteria for success of the redevelopment of the South Bank, and </p> <p>\u0095 Consultation discussions with current and potential national and international performing and visual artists, architects, educa tionalists and curators and people with disabilities. </p> <p>Karsten Witt, chief executive of SBC, says: \"The scale of our public consultation at this stage in an arts-led urban regeneration project is unprecedented in the UK. I am convinced that by continuing to actively encourage informed public involvement at every stage of the re-development we will be able to create a wonderful South Bank for everyone.\" </p> <p><strong> Youth Parliament </strong><br> In the east London borough of Tower Hamlets, a youth parliament was established in 1996 as a platform for young people to voice their views and opinions on local issues. </p> <p>Many of the members of the parliament come from the Bangladeshi community in the borough - which is one of the poorest in Britain. </p> <p>Recently, the youth parliament held discussions on how New Deal money should be spent in their local area, and representatives then presented ideas to the New Deal Board - the body that decides the allocation of funds for this programme. </p> <p>The parliament is also represented on the Single Regeneration Budget local area board, the body which decides how funds for regeneration activities should be distributed.</p> <p>\u0095 Matthew Taylor is director of the Institute for Public Policy Research.

      "bodyText": "When was the last time you were asked your opinion on something that mattered to you? General elections? They're only every four or five years. Local and European elections? Most people can't be bothered. Opinion polls or focus groups? You're more likely to read about one than take part. While much has been said about social exclusion, little attention has been given to the growing phenomenon of the politically excluded - those people who feel they are not represented in our political institutions and who lack the capacity or willingness to make their views heard. It is a condition particularly prevalent among the young, the poor and certain ethnic minority groups. And it is a condition whose effects go wider than its immediate victims. We all get less good government from a system dominated by the three Ms - middle aged, middle class, men. Like poverty, political exclusion is a particular affront to progressives. One of the big arguments between the left and right is about the relative merits of democracy and markets as systems for allocating social goods. While markets are dynamic, creative and appear to offer new choices every day, democracy is creaking, discredited and leaves many people feeling they have no choice. As they say: \"It doesn't matter who you vote for, the politicians always win.\" Something must be done. If the tribulations in Edinburgh, Cardiff and London teach us anything, it is surely that building new institutions is not sufficient to create a new political culture. Fundamentally, we have to recognise that traditional representative democracy must be enhanced by new ways of involving the public in decision making. Some change is already underway. A commitment to public involvement has been made a key part of Labour's modernising government agenda. The government has argued that to achieve their long-term policy objectives - such as improving local services and tackling social exclusion and crime - it is necessary to involve the public. Yet evidence suggests that government departments are carrying out public involvement exercises without developing a coherent cross-departmental approach. There are few opportunities for sharing or learning from best practice, or for pooling experience and expertise across central and local government. We need to develop more coordinated methods - from opinion polls to citizens' juries - of involving the public in decision making, not as alternatives but as complementary to the traditional process. Elected representatives are there to make the difficult decisions. They have experience, access to the necessary expertise and, once elected, should have the legitimacy to govern. But the space on the ballot paper is all. You can place a cross, but you can't write: \"I like my local school, but my mother's lost her home help and I'm worried about street crime.\" Politicians need to be listening and to be showing that they are. This principle is not exclusive to politics. As a nation, we have a poor track record in engaging the general public in the process of change. Too often public involvement is mistaken for mere customer care - a market driven exercise used to refine a particular product or service. Increasingly, private sector bodies are making decisions in the public domain and are recognising the need to involve the public in a more meaningful way. As the government puts more emphasis on the engagement of the voluntary sector in service provision and regeneration, questions are being asked about whether this sector is any less guilty of high-handedness than the public alternative. Exercises in public involvement are vulnerable to three main criticisms: \u0095 The attempt at consultation is little more than an exercise in legitimising a decision already made. \u0095 Those engaged are not truly representative of the public, often because they are the peculiar kind of people who enjoy attending public meetings; \u0095 There remains a powerful imbalance of information between the agency consulting the citizens consulted, and the public. The main reason for these failings is that inclusive, meaningful public involvement is expensive, time consuming and challenging for those who undertake it. Those bodies which are really involving local communities in excellent and groundbreaking ways should be publicly lauded. There is a lot of good work going on, but the danger is that public involvement mechanisms could continue to grow in quantity yet decrease in quality, and consultation fatigue could easily set in among members of the public. Put simply, bad public involvement can often be worse than none at all. The Institute for Public Policy Research, a centre-left think tank, and the Guardian are together launching the Public Involvement Awards. Our premise is that high quality public involvement often goes unrecognised and that best practice is not always spread. These annual awards will publicise and celebrate the impact of successful public involvement. They will reward organisations that have put time and effort into undertaking meaningful consultation, but can also demonstrate that their policies or processes were significantly improved as a result. Any public, private or voluntary sector organisation that has shown a commitment to this principle is encouraged to take part in this award. Similarly, if you are an individual who has been consulted as part of the process of change, tell us about your experience - good or bad. Real choice is more than just being asked your choice from a set of pre-determined outcomes, more than about determining your own answers; it should empower you to change the questions. At its worst, public involvement is window dressing that will increase public cynicism. At its best, it could be a key plank in tackling political exclusion and improving the goods and services we receive. The Guardian/IPPR awards will aim for the best. Cases proven Regulating the internet To discover what a cross section of society thinks about internet regulation, the Independent Television Commission set up a citizens' forum, with 200 people recruited from a large mail-out in Birmingham. They represented all ages and walks of life: some used the internet daily, while others had never even touched a computer. For a day and a half the members of the forum debated the subject - helped by fact sheets, presentations and a panel of four diverse experts. Their opinions were assessed by monitoring these discussions and administering questionnaires before and after the forum. \u0095 lnternet Regulation: The Way Forward? is available on www.itc.org.uk or price \u00a35 from the ITC at 33 Foley Street, London Wl P 7LB Redeveloping the South Bank A major redevelopment of the South Bank site in London (stretching between Waterloo Bridge and County Hall) is currently being planned. The South Bank Centre (SBC) is currently running a massive and innovative consultation programme to involve all those with a stake in the site in the redevelopment, from visitors to residents to artists and performers. Working with Opinion Leader Research hundreds of people have become involved in projects, including: \u0095 A series of citizens' workshops with audiences, visitors, local residents and employees to establish the non-technical criteria for success of the redevelopment of the South Bank, and \u0095 Consultation discussions with current and potential national and international performing and visual artists, architects, educa tionalists and curators and people with disabilities. Karsten Witt, chief executive of SBC, says: \"The scale of our public consultation at this stage in an arts-led urban regeneration project is unprecedented in the UK. I am convinced that by continuing to actively encourage informed public involvement at every stage of the re-development we will be able to create a wonderful South Bank for everyone.\" Youth Parliament In the east London borough of Tower Hamlets, a youth parliament was established in 1996 as a platform for young people to voice their views and opinions on local issues. Many of the members of the parliament come from the Bangladeshi community in the borough - which is one of the poorest in Britain. Recently, the youth parliament held discussions on how New Deal money should be spent in their local area, and representatives then presented ideas to the New Deal Board - the body that decides the allocation of funds for this programme. The parliament is also represented on the Single Regeneration Budget local area board, the body which decides how funds for regeneration activities should be distributed. \u0095 Matthew Taylor is director of the Institute for Public Policy Research.

This group's roadshow included quizzes, role-plays plus workshops on safe sex, sexually transmitted diseases, the nature of relationships and challenging homophobic attitudes.

ACIA estimates 70% of Africans with HIV/Aids live in London. Its work includes support groups, outreach services and domiciliary care.

The scheme, developed through the government's new \"learning labs\" programme, will help those completing their sentences to resume their lives and gain access to a range of public services. </p> <p>Under the initiative, front-line staff from benefit, housing, employment and other agencies have worked together to develop a holistic approach to the needs of prisoners preparing for release. </p> <p>The passport scheme was launched last week at Kirklevington Grange prison, near Middlesbrough, by cabinet enforcer Mo Mowlam. \"This is a fantastic example of joined-up government,\" she said. \"From where I sit in Westminster, these ideas just wouldn't have occurred to me. It really shows the potential for everybody at the front line of service provision to get involved and change things for the better.\" </p> <p>Drawing on this potential, the learning lab think-tank produced a pocket-sized maroon passport which is now issued to every prisoner and recognised by local job centres, housing associations and benefit offices across Teesside. </p> <p>Prisoners are also given help filling out a set of forms, recognised by public service agencies, which they can use to negotiate the maze of red tape awaiting them on release. It is the first step in reclaiming their identity outside prison. </p> <p>John Harrison, a researcher at Sunderland university, has interviewed more than 100 inmates and former prisoners at Kirklevington and Durham prisons. He said those who have served a custodial sentence are most likely to return to crime within the first four weeks of release, so by helping former prisoners establish themselves during this crucial period re-offending rates should fall. </p> <p>\"Many of these people have been jailed for long periods and, because public services are changing all the time, they really don't know where to start in terms of arranging housing benefits and finding a job,\" he said. </p> <p>Overwhelmed by the unfamiliar procedures, requests for personal documents they do not possess, and mountains of forms to fill out, the process of establish ing links with service agencies can be long and frustrating.

      "bodyText": "Prisoners about to leave jails in Teesside have been given passports to help smooth their passage back into society. The scheme, developed through the government's new \"learning labs\" programme, will help those completing their sentences to resume their lives and gain access to a range of public services. Under the initiative, front-line staff from benefit, housing, employment and other agencies have worked together to develop a holistic approach to the needs of prisoners preparing for release. The passport scheme was launched last week at Kirklevington Grange prison, near Middlesbrough, by cabinet enforcer Mo Mowlam. \"This is a fantastic example of joined-up government,\" she said. \"From where I sit in Westminster, these ideas just wouldn't have occurred to me. It really shows the potential for everybody at the front line of service provision to get involved and change things for the better.\" Drawing on this potential, the learning lab think-tank produced a pocket-sized maroon passport which is now issued to every prisoner and recognised by local job centres, housing associations and benefit offices across Teesside. Prisoners are also given help filling out a set of forms, recognised by public service agencies, which they can use to negotiate the maze of red tape awaiting them on release. It is the first step in reclaiming their identity outside prison. John Harrison, a researcher at Sunderland university, has interviewed more than 100 inmates and former prisoners at Kirklevington and Durham prisons. He said those who have served a custodial sentence are most likely to return to crime within the first four weeks of release, so by helping former prisoners establish themselves during this crucial period re-offending rates should fall. \"Many of these people have been jailed for long periods and, because public services are changing all the time, they really don't know where to start in terms of arranging housing benefits and finding a job,\" he said. Overwhelmed by the unfamiliar procedures, requests for personal documents they do not possess, and mountains of forms to fill out, the process of establish ing links with service agencies can be long and frustrating. Many former prisoners also face delays before benefits can be processed and housing arranged. In the meantime, the return to crime is a constant temptation. Nick Harrison, a prison officer at Kirklevington for 11 years, was the first to see that the release process could be made much smoother given a little inter-agency flexibility and co-ordination. Impressed by his ideas, the cabinet office asked him to set up a lab in co-operation with local services. The resulting prisoners' passport scheme is being piloted in five prisons across Teesside with the co-operation of public agencies working together to tailor their services to the needs of individual prisoners. Having spoken to prisoners and the learning lab team, Mowlam was bursting with enthusiasm for inter-agency co-operation. \"How can you get a job when you haven't even got a P45?\" she asked. \"How can you get housing without a job or a job without housing? It's Catch-22.\" The Teesside project is one of five established around the country to tackle problems as diverse as tobacco smuggling or social service provision for pensioners in Torquay. In each case the problem solving approach is the same. A committee of front line service providers work together to develop innovative solutions beyond the mind-set of central government planning. A problem common to all the learning labs is that while many of the solutions offered involve inter-agency co-operation, there is no inter-agency budget to implement them. \"It is too early to give that commitment,\" said Mowlam. \"The prisoners and staff need to buy into the idea and make it work. Then we can find a budget and spread the scheme to other prisons.\" But without a ring-fenced budget it is hard to see how these projects can achieve their potential. The Teesside project, for example, has been trying to raise a budget to place a benefits officer in prisons one day a week, but the cabinet office will not provide the funds. Mowlam has promised to discuss the matter with the treasury.",

During the classical period, the Greek and Roman states maintained a body of priests whose specific task was to read bird signs. Augury involved interpreting future events from the way birds were calling or whether they flocked from the left or the right. The augur's pronouncements could shape major state policies, such as whether to go to war. </p> <p>Making the sparrow's chirp a matter of life and death sounds both absurd and fantastically remote from our own society.

The present government recently announced the establishment of a number of indices to monitor changes in the quality of life; bird populations were selected as the key environmental yardstick.

This is another severe blow for the UK company, which has already lost its biggest customer in Japan by supplying fuel with falsified documents. Germany is its other main potential market. This second example of falsified data is a separate incident and underlines the lax management at the plant, which was heavily criticised by the nuclear installations inspectorate in three reports last Friday. A spokeswoman for the German company, Preussen Elektra, which runs the power station at Unterweser near the Dutch border, said: \"BNFL had always assured us that there was no indication of falsified safety documents.

The Unterweser plant, a boiling water reactor, generates up to 1,255 megawatts of electricity. Shutting it down during one of the coldest months of the year would cause widespread disruption to power supplies in Germany.

BNFL said this was an isolated example. The Japanese falsification had happened much later, when workers had routinely falsified papers rather than laboriously check samples by hand. Whatever the circumstances, the discovery that BNFL had also sent false papers on plutonium fuel pellets to Germany poses a further clear threat to its commercial relationship. It must set back further the company's prospects for partial privatisation. BNFL has to justify the commercial prospects for its new \u00a3300m mixed oxide plant to the government before it can get a licence to run it - a task which looks virtually impossible since there are no customers. The revelation comes at a supremely awkward moment for the German power utilities. Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's coalition government, which includes the Greens, is committed to a phased withdrawal from nuclear energy. The environment minister, J\u00fcrgen Trittin, a Green, on Monday called on the electricity companies to consider whether they should continue their relationship with a trading partner \"which has shown itself to be unreliable\". BNFL has now been given two months by the nuclear installations inspectorate to come up with management plans to improve safety or face having some of its operations shut down.",

      "bodyText": "The Welsh cabinet yesterday became the first executive body in the western world to boast a majority of women ministers. The appointment of a fifth woman to the nine-member cabinet was hailed as a milestone in equal opportunities by the new Labour first secretary, Rhodri Morgan. Sue Essex, 54, was awarded the post of environment secretary as part of a minor reshuffle by Mr Morgan, joining the four existing female members of his Labour cabinet. Tony Blair's cabinet, by contrast, contains only four women out of a total of 22 members, while men outnumber their female cabinet colleagues in every other European country. Mr Morgan said: \"Wales is now the only cabinet in any democratic country in the west with a majority of women in the cabinet. \"This is a small step for the Welsh cabinet but it's a giant leap for Welsh womankind. Wales has overtaken even the Scandinavian countries which have historically had more women in their governments.\" However, he was at pains to stress that Ms Essex, who was also the first female leader of Cardiff city council, had been appointed \"entirely on her own merits\". The remaining four female Welsh cabinet members - agriculture and rural economy sceretary Christine Gwyther; finance secretary Edwina Hart; health and social services sceretary Jane Hutt, and education secretary Rosemary Butler - were all appointed by Mr Morgan's predecessor, Alun Michael. The traditionally male-dominated structure of Welsh politics made Wales an unlikely frontrunner for breaking the gender barrier. But it was the twinning campaign at last May's assembly elections, which saw two constituency parties jointly selecting a male and a female candidate from a shortlist, then allocating one to fight each seat, which resulted in women making up 40% of the assembly, with 15 of the Labour group's 28 members being female. Ms Essex, a university lecturer in planning, described her appointment as \"staggering\". She added: \"It's wonderful. I think from the Labour party's point of view, we've broken the traditional glass ceiling.\"",

      "body": "<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> What are Rubin Carter's opinions of the movie?</p> <p><strong>NJ: </strong>I was very nervous, naturally, to show it to Rubin because he may be 62 years old but, man, could he throw a punch! (Laughter). It was an emotional moment for him to have to sit there and look at his life. There was a silence when the film finished - it was three hours long with a lot of scenes in it that aren't in the film now - and he got up and he turned and I was watching - and he's blind in one eye, he lost an eye while he was in prison - and there was a pause and then I could see he was crying and then he threw his arms around me and said, \"You did a good job, brother\". I think he's pleased (Laughter) I don't think he's really upset and he always said to me, \"I didn't know that I was that good-looking\" (Laughter).</p> <p><strong>TP: </strong> How did he react to you Denzel?</p> <p><strong>DW: </strong> I wasn't there so it was different for me. I actually heard about it from other people, because I was afraid to call him (Laughter) 'cause he had said to me when we were sitting around and talking before shooting, \"If you don't get this right Denzel I'm a-gonna come and see yer\" (Laughter). I said to him then, \"If I didn't think this was bigger than you and I then I'd be worried about that\". But I do think it's bigger than him and I so I wasn't worried about it and he was quite pleased.</p> <p><strong>Question 2: </strong> What scenes got cut?</p> <p><strong>NJ: </strong> I get nervous when a picture goes beyond two hours. Most of my films are not that long. Outside Fiddler on the Roof I don't think I've ever done a picture 2 hours and 25 minutes. I took out a scene where the Canadians are arguing between themselves about whether they should go down to New Jersey. They did have reservations; it did take a long period of time. I took out a scene where the police harassed them in the little apartment they were living in - which happened, which was true. I took out a wonderful scene between Vicellous and Denzel when he looks at the wall and Denzel describes how Rubin sat in prison and looked at the wall and could see a pinpoint of light and he concentrated on that light and he said, \"If you keep looking at it, you can see through it and I can see flowers of the most beautiful kind and I can smell their odours and it gets bigger and I can see children and I...\" And poor Lesra's looking at the wall and he can't... and I liked it because it gave you an insight into the fact that he was talking about freedom, he could see his freedom, even though he never left his cell and that's what why he retreated, I think, into so many spiritual journeys, whether it was with Gandhi or Dr King, or Malcolm or Krishnamurti. I kind of wish I'd left the scene in, the trouble is the picture was getting so long I was afraid people were going to go to sleep.</p> <p><strong>Question 3: </strong> Your film deals with racism and corruption in the judiciary and the police. Was it difficult to get the film made?</p> <p><strong>NJ: </strong> David Picker tried to get this film made 8 - 10 years ago and couldn't get the money to make it, couldn't get the support. I don't think it's the kind of film that the studios are looking for these days (Laughter). We're in a period where content isn't very important (Laughter and applause). No, it was an independent film company, but I don't think there were any political pressures. There's a lot of political pressure now that we've made it. There's one guy in the Newark Ledger who's such a racist I think he wants to try Rubin again - after the Supreme Court has ruled on it! (Laughter) You can't believe the talk shows, you cannot believe it. There's people calling in from New Jersey saying, \"I wasn't in the picture, it's not right\" (Laughter).</p> <p><strong>TP: </strong> It's remarkable any time you make a film about race, it's never the people's town, they were never there!</p> <p><strong>Question 4: </strong> Which of your roles has given you the most personal satisfaction?</p> <p><strong>DW: </strong> Probably the first one ocause my rent was due! (Laughter). I'm asked this a lot and usually answer in a very clich\u00e8d way, \"My next film is my favourite\". I really enjoy the process, I learn a lot and I've gotten a lot from all of them. Working on Cry Freedom was wonderful in that I got to go to Africa for the first time and that was an amazing thing. But in terms of the role itself I don't have a favourite.</p> <p><strong>Question 5: </strong> What's the difference between Norman Jewison and Spike Lee when you're working on a film about racial prejudice?</p> <p><strong>DW: </strong> Different film making styles. I get along with both filmmakers and I can't even answer that question and if I could, I wouldn't.</p> <p><strong>TP: </strong> You have said that it was quite different working on The Soldier's Story which had an all-black cast than on films which didn't have an all-black cast. Can you say a little bit about that?</p> <p><strong>DW: </strong> Did I say that?! When I did A Soldier's Story with Norman I was very young and green and thought I knew everything - now I know I know everything! - it was a very different time in my life and career but just in terms of styles there are two entirely different approaches they have to making films and I've made three films with Spike and I've made two with Norman and would love to make it three. I will continue to work with both of them. I love working with both of them.</p> <p><strong>Question 6: </strong> Is Hollywood still racist towards actors?</p> <p><strong>DW: </strong> I always say racism doesn't start at the California border, or the border of Hollywood, racism is a factor in US, if not in the world. It's also a factor, obviously, in Hollywood. Where I think the most work needs to be done is behind the camera, not in front of it. One of the things we've seen in the 80s with the Spike Lees and the Robert Townsends and other filmmakers is that if you go for it and take the time and put in the effort to write your own material and absolutely refuse to be denied the right to make your film it is difficult whatever colour you are. But I think that's where the future lies. I think that if there can be considered racism it's to do with the lack of opportunities for writers and producers and the people behind the camera. That being said, it's very difficult for women of any colour in Hollywood. The men get older and the women get younger somehow and I think the bottom of the totem pole is African-American women, or women of colour. I think they get the least opportunities in Hollywood and they have the toughest road ahead of them. I've been very blessed. I've made 26 films in 20 years and haven't been unemployed for 20 years. I'm an exception to the rule but I still think we've got a long way to go. The NAACP has been very active in Los Angeles and they've been putting a lot of pressure on the studios to hire more people and I think that's good 'cause I know the minute they stop doing that then there'll be less and less people of colour in those positions. I think we've made some inroads when you look at the way Hattie McDaniel had to perform and the way African-Americans can perform now we've come a long way.</p> <p><strong>Question 7: </strong> After shooting finished did you have any anger towards white people?</p> <p><strong>DW: </strong> At the end of the film?! (Laughter). One good thing about acting in film is that it's good therapy. It's a process to have an effect on the audience. If you did then in some ways I've done my job, but I get a lot of my emotions and anger in the work itself and I've been around the block. As Malcolm X used to say, it's one thing to be angry, it's another thing to know - just to be angry and out of control won't do you any good, if you have an enemy then learn and know your enemy, don't just be mad at him or her. My career for a long time has been about the business of doing something about the anger that I felt and through the roles that I play and it's no coincidence that playing some of the roles that I play is for a particular reason, for a particular effect - like Malcolm X and The Hurricane. I'm not afraid to upset people. But I am not as upset because I understand what I'm up against.</p> <p><strong>Question 8: </strong> Tell us your experience on working on The Heat of the Night</p> <p><strong>NJ: </strong> I knew it was going to be a controversial film, an important film simply because of the times. This was probably before you were born -1966 we were shooting. I think timing has a great deal to do with films. There's a wonderful story about timing. I was skiing in Sun Valley at Christmas, just before shooting In the Heat of the Night, and I met Bobby Kennedy - our kids both broke legs in a ski race and I met him in the hospital and he asked me what I did and I told him a little bit about the story, about a black detective who works in Philadelphia and he gets stuck in a Mississippi town and the red-neck sheriff and the circumstances and the racism. And he said, \"This is a very important film, Norman. Timing is everything in life, in art, in politics.\" And so we had spent New Year's Eve together then he sent me research on young people in the Southern United States at that time, and he stayed in touch, he really was sincere about it. I didn't think too much of it but when the film was finished it won the New York Critics' award and I went to New York to get the award and who was giving out the awards? The senator of New York, Robert Kennedy. As I went up to get the award he says, \"See, I told you that timing was everything!\"</p> <p><strong>Question 9: </strong> Was the decision to shoot the boxing scenes in black and white homage to Raging Bull?</p> <p><strong>NJ: </strong> As much as I'd like to say I was paying homage to Martin Scorsese I really wasn't. The reason I shot it in black and white was that I had a long discussion with Roger Deakins, the British cameraman who shot this film who I think is quite brilliant, probably as good a cameraman as I've ever worked with in my life. Scorsese's film is brilliantly done, but it's very stylised like they built the ring in certain ways, there's a lot of steam and slow motion and so on and I wanted a very terse almost semi-journalistic, very real, believable boxing scenes which meant that Denzel would have to go into training for God knows how long (Laughter) and box two hours a day for six months. He lost over 40 pounds, he was unbelievable, what he did personally. Because you're all alone, the director can't help you. You're going to be there all alone. A pair of shorts and that's it. You can't use stand-ins, you can't do anything. It has to be very carefully choreographed so that no one gets hurt. The only reference we had was black and white television, we had the old Monday night fights, the Gillette fights, \"It's Monday night, the fight!\" But the reason that they were in black and white was because there was no colour television so here we were looking at all these black and white [shows] and I said, \"You know if we could just recreate that...\" I think that's where it started and then we realized that if we did that the audience would feel maybe that it was going to be a docu-drama, that there was something very real happening because it was period, it was 1966, and then if I went to colour right in the middle of it I could jump the audience from 1966 into the 80s and they would understand that. I think it really helped the film stylistically.</p> <p><strong>Question 10: </strong> If you could choose one person to meet from history who would it be?</p> <p><strong>DW: </strong> That carpenter from Galilee (Laughter)</p> <p><strong>NJ: </strong> I'd like to have dinner with his dad (Laughter)</p> <p><strong>Question 11: </strong> Does artistic power ever scare you?</p> <p><strong>NJ: </strong> I don't think people read as much anymore and I think films have become important. I used to think when I was young that I could change the world, that my films were going to have a great effect on people. I found out that it's still a movie, that there's still that suspension of belief. I worry that people will misinterpret what I'm trying to say. That's what I worry about the most and if I worry about it too much then the film will become simplistic and filled with perhaps with too overt a message, so I try to find stories that I would think that everyone would find interesting, and just a good entertaining story, and then if I can find a story that has a raison d'etre behind it that I feel is important then that's the best for me. But I do think films should be what you pull out of them. They should mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people, perhaps. I don't know, it's hard.</p> <p><strong>DW: </strong> I'd probably be a bit more frightened by not using whatever abilities I'd been given. I'd be more frightened by procrastination and laziness and I agree with Norman in that it is just a movie, on the other hand I receive thousands of letters a year and I see the impact that it has on people. But it's just using what you've been given to say what you feel you want to say.</p> <p><strong>TP: </strong> You said earlier about the universal stemming from the specific and the comparison may be too simple but interestingly someone made the parallel with In the Heat of the Night and this movie. I saw In the Heat of the Night as a kid and the thing that struck me as a young black person watching it was both identification with Sidney Poitier, but the fact that Poitier was able to universalise a story which would mean something to me as a black person but maybe in other circumstances would mean to people who were not black and I get the sense from what people have told me about Hurricane that Denzel Washington has done the same thing in this movie. To what extent is this particular actor important in your being able to universalise a story about racial injustice in a way that a wide audience, besides a black audience, can accept it and identify with it?</p> <p><strong>NJ: </strong> Both actors are so intelligent and extremely sensitive and seem to be able to give the camera an interpretation beyond the script, beyond the lines that are there and I think Denzel is comfortable with himself as a person and therefore he knows who he is. People are comfortable with him, they like someone who is... Mmm, boy, this is hard. (Laughter).</p> <p><strong>DW: </strong> I wonder what Spike would say... ! (Laughter)</p> <p><strong>TP: </strong> I wonder to what extent you consciously feel this because you're now clearly amongst serious actors or actors with serious roles, the leading African-American, and the leading marquee name amongst African-American actors in this genre. This ability and the possibility of being able to universalise these stories is important to you and the choice of roles that you make.</p> <p><strong>DW: </strong> It goes back to the universal stemming from the specific. I don't concern myself with that. I cannot if I am a cup maker [picks up glass] I'm interested in making the best cup that I possibly can. My effort goes into that cup, not what people think about it. Now that may sound selfish but that's the only way I can operate. I can't walk around the room and ask each person their opinion of it - definitely not while I'm making it. And once it's done [slams glass down and looks at it], whatever they think, but I really don't care.</p> <p><strong>NJ: </strong> You see how sure he is! (Laughter)</p> <p><strong>DW: </strong> One of my favourite books was Lust for Life and Van Gogh was out there and burning up in the sun and I dug that, nobody was out there and nobody bought any of his paintings and now look at him. (Laughter) People buy mine but I relate to that. I don't know - and I don't want to say I don't care ocause I do - but I don't know what people are going to think and I don't do it for what I think they're going to think. I do it for what I think and what I feel and hopefully they'll buy that cup.</p> <p><strong>NJ: </strong> I think he's an artist - he doesn't need anyone's approval.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Question 1: What are Rubin Carter's opinions of the movie? NJ: I was very nervous, naturally, to show it to Rubin because he may be 62 years old but, man, could he throw a punch! (Laughter). It was an emotional moment for him to have to sit there and look at his life. There was a silence when the film finished - it was three hours long with a lot of scenes in it that aren't in the film now - and he got up and he turned and I was watching - and he's blind in one eye, he lost an eye while he was in prison - and there was a pause and then I could see he was crying and then he threw his arms around me and said, \"You did a good job, brother\". I think he's pleased (Laughter) I don't think he's really upset and he always said to me, \"I didn't know that I was that good-looking\" (Laughter). TP: How did he react to you Denzel? DW: I wasn't there so it was different for me. I actually heard about it from other people, because I was afraid to call him (Laughter) 'cause he had said to me when we were sitting around and talking before shooting, \"If you don't get this right Denzel I'm a-gonna come and see yer\" (Laughter). I said to him then, \"If I didn't think this was bigger than you and I then I'd be worried about that\". But I do think it's bigger than him and I so I wasn't worried about it and he was quite pleased. Question 2: What scenes got cut? NJ: I get nervous when a picture goes beyond two hours. Most of my films are not that long. Outside Fiddler on the Roof I don't think I've ever done a picture 2 hours and 25 minutes. I took out a scene where the Canadians are arguing between themselves about whether they should go down to New Jersey. They did have reservations; it did take a long period of time. I took out a scene where the police harassed them in the little apartment they were living in - which happened, which was true. I took out a wonderful scene between Vicellous and Denzel when he looks at the wall and Denzel describes how Rubin sat in prison and looked at the wall and could see a pinpoint of light and he concentrated on that light and he said, \"If you keep looking at it, you can see through it and I can see flowers of the most beautiful kind and I can smell their odours and it gets bigger and I can see children and I...\" And poor Lesra's looking at the wall and he can't... and I liked it because it gave you an insight into the fact that he was talking about freedom, he could see his freedom, even though he never left his cell and that's what why he retreated, I think, into so many spiritual journeys, whether it was with Gandhi or Dr King, or Malcolm or Krishnamurti. I kind of wish I'd left the scene in, the trouble is the picture was getting so long I was afraid people were going to go to sleep. Question 3: Your film deals with racism and corruption in the judiciary and the police. Was it difficult to get the film made? NJ: David Picker tried to get this film made 8 - 10 years ago and couldn't get the money to make it, couldn't get the support. I don't think it's the kind of film that the studios are looking for these days (Laughter). We're in a period where content isn't very important (Laughter and applause). No, it was an independent film company, but I don't think there were any political pressures. There's a lot of political pressure now that we've made it. There's one guy in the Newark Ledger who's such a racist I think he wants to try Rubin again - after the Supreme Court has ruled on it! (Laughter) You can't believe the talk shows, you cannot believe it. There's people calling in from New Jersey saying, \"I wasn't in the picture, it's not right\" (Laughter). TP: It's remarkable any time you make a film about race, it's never the people's town, they were never there! Question 4: Which of your roles has given you the most personal satisfaction? DW: Probably the first one ocause my rent was due! (Laughter). I'm asked this a lot and usually answer in a very clich\u00e8d way, \"My next film is my favourite\". I really enjoy the process, I learn a lot and I've gotten a lot from all of them. Working on Cry Freedom was wonderful in that I got to go to Africa for the first time and that was an amazing thing. But in terms of the role itself I don't have a favourite. Question 5: What's the difference between Norman Jewison and Spike Lee when you're working on a film about racial prejudice? DW: Different film making styles. I get along with both filmmakers and I can't even answer that question and if I could, I wouldn't. TP: You have said that it was quite different working on The Soldier's Story which had an all-black cast than on films which didn't have an all-black cast. Can you say a little bit about that? DW: Did I say that?! When I did A Soldier's Story with Norman I was very young and green and thought I knew everything - now I know I know everything! - it was a very different time in my life and career but just in terms of styles there are two entirely different approaches they have to making films and I've made three films with Spike and I've made two with Norman and would love to make it three. I will continue to work with both of them. I love working with both of them. Question 6: Is Hollywood still racist towards actors? DW: I always say racism doesn't start at the California border, or the border of Hollywood, racism is a factor in US, if not in the world. It's also a factor, obviously, in Hollywood. Where I think the most work needs to be done is behind the camera, not in front of it. One of the things we've seen in the 80s with the Spike Lees and the Robert Townsends and other filmmakers is that if you go for it and take the time and put in the effort to write your own material and absolutely refuse to be denied the right to make your film it is difficult whatever colour you are. But I think that's where the future lies. I think that if there can be considered racism it's to do with the lack of opportunities for writers and producers and the people behind the camera. That being said, it's very difficult for women of any colour in Hollywood. The men get older and the women get younger somehow and I think the bottom of the totem pole is African-American women, or women of colour. I think they get the least opportunities in Hollywood and they have the toughest road ahead of them. I've been very blessed. I've made 26 films in 20 years and haven't been unemployed for 20 years. I'm an exception to the rule but I still think we've got a long way to go. The NAACP has been very active in Los Angeles and they've been putting a lot of pressure on the studios to hire more people and I think that's good 'cause I know the minute they stop doing that then there'll be less and less people of colour in those positions. I think we've made some inroads when you look at the way Hattie McDaniel had to perform and the way African-Americans can perform now we've come a long way. Question 7: After shooting finished did you have any anger towards white people? DW: At the end of the film?! (Laughter). One good thing about acting in film is that it's good therapy.

Egg and Prudential banking made a loss of \u00a3150m last year, compared with \u00a377m in 1998. Prudential said it expected Egg to break even in the latter part of 2001, adding that investment in the concern would be similar to the \u00a3150m spent in 1999. Mr Bloomer ruled out a large-scale merger such as that announced this week by the insurance companies CGU and Norwich Union. However, he said Prudential would look to make acquisitions in Europe to enable it to compete with the likes of Allianz, Axa, Aegon and Generali, as well as the merged CGNU. Mr Bloomer takes over from Sir Peter Davis as chief executive next month. Sir Peter, who is credited with having transformed Prudential during his tenure, is moving to Sainsbury's, the retail group.

It could be, after all, that the Portugal in my head is a completely partial one, based entirely on those few auteur films that get on to the international festival circuit, that once in a blue moon get distributed in Britain, and that occasionally inspire film-makers elsewhere (among them Alain Tanner, Wim Wenders and Time Regained director Raul Ruiz).</p> <p>Various things may contribute to giving Portuguese cinema its peculiar flavour: its geographic position on the edge of Europe; the folk memory of a crumbled colonial past and the experience of dictatorship this century; a distinctively literary mindset among many film-makers, and the shadow of its modern national poet, the gloom-merchant Fernando Pessoa. Perhaps there's also a sense that, if the outside world couldn't care less, then there's nothing to lose - hence a profusion of strange, severe hot-house blooms.</p> <p>In fact, some of Portugal's slim national output remains unknown outside the country - its latest box-office hits include a pop-movie vehicle for a TV presenter - and many Portuguese critics are said to be sceptical about the country's artier exports. You can judge the wider picture from a rare package of new Portuguese film that comes to Britain this week under the title Sea Changes.</p> <p>It opens with the national auteur par excellence - the nonagenarian Manoel de Oliveira (pictured), who made his first film in 1931. His recent autobiographical miniature, Journey to the Beginning of the World, was the very model of what they call an \"autumnal masterpiece\". His latest film, The Letter, is a rewrite of the 17th- century novel La Princesse de Cl\u00e8ves: in this version, a young aristocrat (Chiara Mastroianni) falls for a Portuguese rock singer - one Pedro Abrunhosa, who plays himself. The ultimate drift of it is just this side of unfathomable, but there's no mistaking the mastery.</p> <p>Another great individual is Joao Cesar Monteiro, who stars in his own films as his alter ego Joao de Deus. An emaciated, goatish presence, Monteiro is a truly anarchic confrontationalist, with a staggering talent for visual comedy. He can also be a long-winded bore and unsavoury lech; take him as you find him, as they say. The season doesn't feature his best film God's Comedy, about a philosopher- pervert in charge of an ice-cream parlour, but it does have the crazily uncompromising The Hips of JW - a chunk of Strindberg crossed with a plot about an expedition to find John Wayne waggling his hips at the North Pole. It's a staggeringly self-indulgent film, but everyone ought to see Monteiro in action at least once.</p> <p>The season also represents the reality factor in Portuguese cinema: notably Teresa Vilaverde's punchy, rather Loach-ish Os Mutantes, about young Lisbon delinquents; Mal, an enigmatic tale of urban lost souls; and one genuine overlooked masterpiece - Ossos (Bones) by Pedro Costa. \"Bressonian\" is a term that's bandied around a lot, but Ossos lives up to it - a very stark picture of impoverished Lisbon shanty youth. Costa lets his emaciated cast stare us out in close-up, or places them in disturbing street scenes - one of them, apparently set up as a v*rit* candid camera routine, has a character hang around a bustling square, trying to palm off his baby on passers by.</p> <p>Ossos is an example of a national cinema that's accomplished and hard-edged, but that's never going to take over the world, and will probably never even be subject to the same fashionable art-house rediscovery that Iran and Denmark are currently experiencing. Given the European rush to cosmopolitanism in film, there's something strangely old-fashioned in Portuguese film-makers' seriousness and their commitment to a small canvas. There's also a waywardness, a continuing sense that discoveries are always possible. Portugal may be artistically and geographically on the margins, but it may prove to be central in keeping the European art- cinema tradition alive.</p> <p>\u0095 Sea Changes opens at London's Cine Lumiere tomorrow, then tours.

But who are the noisiest whiners? Frank Dobson was belly-aching even after his victory, grumpily assuring us yet again that he was wholeheartedly opposed to Tony Blair's \"electoral college\" (which is not so much a college as one of those grand-sounding but bogus universities that will sell you a degree certificate for $10).

When he stands in a contested election and wins a mere 25,000 votes against 80,000 for his main rival, wily old Dobbo is still declared the winner. \"Stop whining,\" John Prescott instructs those of us who have the temerity to raise an eyebrow at this extraordinary feat of ballot-rigging, which would make the late Mayor Daley sigh with admiration. But who are the noisiest whiners? Frank Dobson was belly-aching even after his victory, grumpily assuring us yet again that he was wholeheartedly opposed to Tony Blair's \"electoral college\" (which is not so much a college as one of those grand-sounding but bogus universities that will sell you a degree certificate for $10). What he wanted, he said, was the verdict of Labour members, as delivered through one member, one vote. Though he affects to be unaware of it, that verdict was duly delivered; and he lost. It's just as well he doesn't have to face himself in the shaving mirror every morning: if he means what he says, how can Dobson pretend that he is the legitimate Labour candidate?

      "bodyText": "The Mirror Liverpool will make a move to sign AEK Athens striker Demis Nikolaidis on loan until the end of the season. The Greek international is rated at \u00a35m; Liverpool would pay a loan fee and if the player does well they would come up with the rest of the money in the summer. Teamtalk AC Milan have opened negotiations with Celtic to sign \u00a37m Mark Viduka. Valencia are also interested in the 24-year-old Australian, but Milan are favourites for his signature. Rangers have reportedly signed AZ Alkmaar's Dutch right-back Fernando Ricksen for \u00a33m. But Opta Soccer claim that Coventry will launch a \u00a33.5m counter-bid. Opta Soccer Arsenal are close to signing Marseille winger Robert Pires as replacement for Barca-bound Marc Overmars. Pires' agent met Arsene Wenger in London on Tuesday to talk over a move. Daily Star Eric Tinkler will quit Barnsley in the summer even if they are promoted to the Premiership.",

There are the dozens of fantasy novels, including the Elric series which made his name; there is the prize-winning Cornelius Quartet (1966-77), whose polysexual dandy-nihilist hero Jerry Cornelius shared Moorcock's own Notting Hill home of the era, turning that quarter of London into a mythical zone for decades of bohemians. And then, there's Mother London (1988), his time-chopping tribute to his city from the Blitz to Thatcher, and his Colonel Pyat quartet, thousands of pages long, still unfinished, a digging into the Holocaust's roots.

The first Cornelius book, The Final Programme (1966), was mocking yet heartfelt in celebrating the times. \"I was central,\" says Moorcock. \"All the hippies loved the fantasy books, they never read anything else. Everybody who was really famous really liked me. I flung myself into the counter-culture, because I'm a hedonist, and I loved the drugs. I loved everything.

The figure, which will have to come from increased subsidies and higher rail fares, emerged after the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, announced changes amid a hail of protest against his decision to allow Railtrack to keep its safety role. The families of those bereaved in the Paddington crash accused Mr Prescott of a u-turn and going back on promises he made to strip Railtrack of its safety resposibilities. The \u00a32.5bn total suggested by Sir David Davies, president of the Royal Academy of Engineering, as the price for in stalling the most modern safety equipment in a driver's cab, will be achieved over the next 10 years. The families of the Paddington victims were not impressed with the government's tactics, or that ministers had seen fit to release three sensitive post-Paddington reports during the week of the inquest into the tragedy. The first, by Sir David, calls for the introduction of new safety controls in train cabs. Diana Macaulay, whose 26-year-old son was killed in the crash, said allowing Railtrack to be responsible for safety was \"like putting Peter Rabbit in charge of a lettuce patch\". Paddington survivor David Taylor, said that the government's decision to allow Railtrack to keep its safety role in a subidiary company was \"an insult\" to the memory of the people who had died. He said that a second internal report by the department of transport on whether safety should be removed from Railtrack was \"a complete u-turn\" and demonstrated that Mr Prescott was full of \"hot air\". A third report by the health and safety executive absolves Railtrack from making commercial gain from safety, but says that much of its safety programmes should be improved. Both Mr Prescott and the transport minister, Lord Mac donald, pointed out that Railtrack would be losing one of its functions, the responsibility for deciding whether train companies were safe to operate. Mr Prescott suggested that setting up a subsidiary company to handle safety at Railtrack was only a holding operation because of legislative restrictions. Like the transport select committee, he is in favour of an independent transport safety authority and will be passing on this view to Lord Cullen, who will be heading the public inquiry into the Paddington crash later this year. One of Lord Cullen's tasks will be to report on rail safety generally. Mr Prescott declared: \"I would not be wise to pre-empt the Cullen inquiry. I am caught here. Do I do nothing?

But the Liberal Democrats spokesman, Michael Moore, called the plan for a Railtrack subsidiary \"half-baked\". Bernard Jenkin, Conservative transport spokesman, said that the government had been panicked into making decisions immediately after Paddington due to the public outcry. It was now repenting at leisure. Industry sources admitted that Railtrack's subsidiary would mean very little change to Railtrack's safety regime. Almost the same people would be working together, and it was a matter of changing round the chairs. Sir David's report to Mr Prescott called for the introduction of a cheaper and less sophisticated train safety system as the best short-term solution for the railways. His conclusion means that the more costly automatic train protection system recommended more than 10 years ago, after the Clapham rail crash, is still not seen as the best immediate remedy for trains passing signals at danger. The report said that the rail industry should plan, as a first stage, to fit the cheaper train protection and warning system, with the second stage upgrading of the system.

However, he gave nothing new away about the government's stance on the single currency. \"In principle we are in favour of joining a successful single currency. In practice we have to get the economic conditions right. The final say is with the people in a referendum. Meanwhile we are making the necessary preparations in the manner we have set out,\" he said. Mr Blair took a swipe at the landmark speech on Europe made by former Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher in Bruges more than 10 years ago. \"From it stemmed the isolationist and hostile view of the European Union that has dominated the UK Conservative party ever since. It began the 'opt out' mentality that characterised Britain's relations with Europe - despite the best early efforts of [former Tory prime minister] Mr Major - for almost a decade.\" Britain's place has historically always been in Europe, the prime minister said, adding that political hesitation over Europe was \"one of my country's greatest miscalculations of the post-war years\". But he accepted that some of Mrs Thatcher's criticisms of Europe were justified - and shared by others in the EU. However, he went on: \"My disagreement is that the response to those criticisms was for Britain to withdraw into its shell, to opt out: to see - at least in terms of presentation - the European Union as Britain versus Europe.\" Shadow chancellor Michael Portillo had earlier accused Mr Blair of misleading the British people by suggesting that the logic of the Conservatives' opposition to the euro was that ultimately Britain should withdraw from the EU. Mr Blair was attempting to generate a smokescreen to cloak his inability to persuade the electorate of the merits of joining the euro, Mr Portillo claimed. \"He is holding up an entirely false debate. He is trying to argue against people who want to pull Britain out of the European Union. We are not proposing that, no other major party is proposing that, so why on the earth is the prime minister speaking about such a ridiculous thing?\" he said Lord Norman Lamont, who as chancellor in John Major's government was one of Britain's negotiators at Maastricht and is now vice-president of the Eurosceptic Bruges group of Tory politicians, branded the speech as \"naivety on stilts\". \"The prime minister's European policy is a re-run of an old movie which we have all seen and whose ending we all know,\" he added.",

      "body": "<p> At a time when the European Union is embarking on radical expansion and internal reform, I would like to take a moment to put the challenges facing Europe in context. </p> <p> My starting point is this: the European Union has been one of the outstanding political achievements of the twentieth century. </p> <p> NATO kept the peace. But it was the European Union and its predecessors, jumpstarted by the enlightened self-interest of the Marshall Plan, that led to the political and economic reconstruction of Europe. </p> <p> The project that began with the European Coal and Steel Community had one over-arching objective: to end the feud between France and Germany that had been at the heart of one European and two world wars in less than a century. </p> <p> The project has succeeded brilliantly. It has turned the age-old rivalry between France and Germany into friendship and partnership, so much so that France and Germany have been the driving force behind the European project for 50 years. </p> <p> But the European Union has done more than that, much more. </p> <p> It has provided a Framework for law and institutions which respects the rights of Europe's democracies, large and small: which allows competition but prevents dominance. </p> <p> It has provided the framework for Europe's prosperity, not just free trade in Europe, but a single market and, increasingly, a single economy. </p> <p> And it has provided a clear path forward for countries emerging from political dictatorship and centrally planned economics. </p> <p> It was the European Union more than any other institution that helped Greece, Spain and Portugal turn their back on dictatorship. </p> <p> Not by force of arms, but by force of example. </p> <p> It was the European Union and with it the vision of a prosperous, democratic, European Germany that helped bring down the Berlin Wall, so setting off the chain reaction that ended the Cold War. </p> <p> And it is the hope and promise of European Union membership that is now driving political and economic reform across eastern Europe and the Balkans, from Latvia to Bulgaria, from Poland to Croatia. </p> <p> That is strengthening the hand of those who believe in democracy and free enterprise, against those who would exploit the fear of change to play the card of nationalism and protectionism. </p> <p> The European Union is on the threshold of achieving the dreams of its founders. Of reuniting the continent in peace, democracy and prosperity. </p> <p> But Britain could have played and can play a larger part in it. </p> <p> <strong>Britain in Europe</strong> </p> <p> Britains relations with Europe have too often been ambivalent or indifferent, Indeed, I believe Britain's hesitation over Europe was one of my country's greatest miscalculations of the post-War years. </p> <p> We opted out of the European Coal and Steel Community. We opted out of the European Economic Community. We opted out of the Social Chapter. And we played little part in the debate over the single currency. When we finally decided to join many of these institutions, we found unsurprisingly that they did not reflect British interests or British experience as much as we would have wished. </p> <p> Yet, as our history shows, Britains place has always been at the centre of Europe. England was a European power long before it became an imperial one. No King of England if not King of France, as Shakespeare's Henry V rather bluntly put it. </p> <p> Even in the days of Empire, Britain was first and foremost a European power, preserving the balance in Europe, opposing those who sought to dominate Europe. </p> <p> Belgian history can attest to that. </p> <p> Waterloo, Ypres, the Battle of the Bulge. </p> <p> British servicemen died to set Europe free. Yet since the second world war, Britain has too often been an observer in Europes development, not a player. </p> <p> With the creation of the European Union, for the first time in our history, we were content to stand aside from a major development on the continent. </p> <p> Nearly 60% of British trade is with the rest of the European Union. Over three million British jobs and billions of pounds of investment in Britain depend on Europe. Europe's s global trade interests arc Britains trade interests. </p> <p> Of course, Britain could survive outside the European Union. But it would be a poorer, weaker Britain. We could probably get access to the Single Market, as Norway and Switzerland do. But the price would be applying Europes laws without having the chance to shape them. </p> <p> That is why I am determined that Britain should play its full part in Europe - for the same reason that Belgium or France play their full part in Europe: because that is what is best for my country. </p> <p> A few miles from here, in Bruges, another British Prime Minister made a speech. From it stemmed the isolationist and hostile view of the European Union. My disagreement with Mrs Thatcher's speech in Bruges is not that its criticisms were all unjustified. Some were justified. Some indeed were and are shared by others in the European Union. My disagreement is that the response to those criticisms was for Britain to withdraw into its shell, to opt-out. To see at least in terms of presentation the European Union as Britain vs Europe. </p> <p> The result was not that Europe stopped moving, but that Britain stopped shaping the form and direction of that movement. The very lesson that the development of the Single Market taught us where Britain was heavily engaged was abandoned. The idea of Britain vs Europe also infected the debate in Britain and encouraged the perception that Europe was something done to Britain, over which we had little say. </p> <p> And as we lost influence in Europe, it did not help us in America. Britain has close ties with America. They will remain close, no more so than under this Government. But America wants Britain to be a strong ally in a strong Europe. The stronger we are in Europe, the stronger our American relationship. </p> <p> I hold to my view that Britain's destiny is to be a leading partner in Europe. It is right for Britain, and it is right for Europe. It is a central ambition for the New Labour Government. </p> <p> The change in our relations in Europe since May 1997 has been fundamental. Britain has fully participated in every new initiative: economic reform; defence and foreign policy; institutional change and enlargement; immigration and crime. To each we have made a substantive and clear contribution. Without it, the nature of the changes would have becn very different. </p> <p> And we have not found ourselves alone in arguing the case for reform. Others, like the new government in Belgium. are arguing the case with us. </p> <p> At this crucial juncture, where reforms of an absolutely momentous nature are being debated and decided, Britains place must be at the centre of them. To withdraw from them is not patriotic; it is an abdication of our true national interest. Other countries playing a leading role in Europe do not see the European Union as an alternative to the nation state; indeed, they see it as a way of enhancing their national interests. At a time when countries are coming together ASEAN in Asia, MERCOSUR in Latin America, NAFTA in North America - Eurosceptic isolationism means marginalisation. </p> <p> If people tell you that the argument for Europe has been lost in Britain, they are wrong. Of course our position is made more difficult by our media. One part has abandoned all sense of objectivity and is essentially hostile to the European Union. The other part is supine in the face of that hostility. </p> <p> Take the example of last years financial negotiations at Berlin. Europe is always at its most hard-headed when it comes to paying for it. But by making our case persuasively, we protected Britains rebate and got a very good deal on structural funds. Yet that got a fraction of the media attention that attended the failure by France to lift the ban on British beef, even though the financial consequences for Britain were more far-reaching. </p> <p> Another example is Vodafone-Mannesman. For weeks, our media had been telling us that this was the test of reform, and that Europe would flunk it. That politicians, rather than shareholders, would decide. When the deal went through, the British media barely commented on its enormous implications. </p> <p> In fact, reform is already happening in Europe. In Germany, the government has announced plans to reform capital gains tax, opening the way for the radical restructuring of German industry. 40% of French shares are now owned by people who arent French. Italy is reforming its labour markets. Belgium, the Netherlands and Scandinavia are setting the pace in Europe on welfare reform. </p> <p> That is why I will carry on pressing for a more mature and sensible attitude. So that we in Britain dont blow every dispute with the European Union or with another member state into a crisis, and get a bit of balance into our debate. </p> <p> We are committed to Europe. and to reform in Europe. I am determined that Britain will play its full part in the reforms necessary for the European Union to move to the next stage of its development. </p> <p> So what are the main areas for reform? </p> <p> <strong>Lisbon</strong> </p> <p> At the Lisbon summit next month, Europe will be dealing with a dilemma confronting us all: economic reform. How do we reap the benefits of globalisation while preserving our values and strengthening our societies? </p> <p> The choice facing Europe here is not between status quo or reform. The choice facing Europe is between uncontrolled change forced by the markets, or a process of economic reform that delivers both economic dynamism and social justice. </p> <p> Globalisation and the competitive effects of the Euro make reform inevitable. </p> <p> As for our own position on the Euro, it is clear. Despite whatever you read or hear, it will remain exactly where it is. In principle, we are in favour of joining a successful single currency. In practice, we have to get the economic conditions right The final say is with the people in a referendum. Meanwhile, we are making the necessary preparations in the manner we have set out. </p> <p> We are all, however, in the midst of a wider economic transformation. A revolution in technology. An explosion in international capital. The wind of economic change has never blown through our economies with such force. </p> <p> Every government in Europe is having to respond. </p> <p> Here in Belgium, the government of Guy Verhofstadt is leading the way in strengthening Europes social model by modernising it. Active welfare measures that recognise that work is the best way out of poverty. Cutting non-wage labour costs. The Rosetta plan to tackle youth unemployment. Flexible and decentralised wage bargaining. More labour market mobility. </p> <p> But some things can only be done effectively at the European level. </p> <p> If Europe is to compete on equal terms with America in the new economy, were going to have to create a whole new single market. </p> <p> E-businesses are not like traditional businesses. They start small, use knowledge and intellectual property as their raw materials, operate internationally, and grow exponentially. </p> <p> If Europe is to give them the same benefits that America offers, we need to extend the single market to the internet, to innovation, telecoms, and venture capital. Europe cant legislate for technology entrepreneurs. But we can surely get out of their way. </p> <p> That is the main challenge for the Lisbon summit: how to make Europe the best place in the world to do business in the new high-tech knowledge economy. </p> <p> But the Lisbon agenda rightly goes wider. It is about promoting economic dynamism and social justice. About recognising that getting people back to work is the best way of alleviating poverty and strengthening societies. </p> <p> I also hope that Lisbon will mark a turning point in Europe's approach to economic and social policy at the European level. Legislation to push through liberalisation, enforced by strong independent institutions. Benchmarking and peer review to make best practice the norm in areas where member states have the sole or main responsibility, such as social and employment policy. </p> <p> Today, Guy Verhofstadt and I have announced a joint proposal for Lisbon on modernising European social policy so that it makes work pay. </p> <p> Wc want to put full employment back at the heart of Europe's social agenda. This requires a cross-cutting, joined up approach to policy-making. A stable macro-economic framework; market liberalisation; welfare reform. </p> <p> Europe needs to be able to respond rapidly to technical, economic and social change and compete globally. To have flexible and fair working arrangements which encourage individual choice and overcome disincentives to work. To recognise the key role of education, skills and life-long learning. </p> <p> A Europe of full employment also calls for the modernisation of European social policy. Changing social and economic conditions means that we need a new concept of the welfare state if we are to continue to deliver the services people need. </p> <p> In Belgium and Britain we are now pursuing active welfare policies. Reforming our welfare systems so they become springboards for employment rather than simply safety nets. </p> <p> And finally, Belgium and Britain will be advocating a new focus on small businesses as the main generator of jobs in modern economies. </p> <p> <strong>Wider reform</strong> </p> <p> But while economic reform is vitally important, it is not enough by itself. </p> <p> Europe's post-war political leadership built the European Union on the basis of widespread popular support. But as the EU has matured and taken on more powers, and as the external and internal threats have subsided, the people of Europe have rightly come to expect more of a say in how it is run. </p> <p> The world is changing. The Cold War is over, but we face new threats in the Balkans. from international crime, from global poverty and instability, from the consequences of mass migration. </p> <p> Europe is responding to these new realities. </p> <p> In 1998, Britain and France took the initiative to strengthen Europe's common defences in a way that also strengthens NATO. EU Member States are now looking at ways of enhancing their military capabilities against headline goals. </p> <p> NATO will always remain the cornerstone of European defence. Both of our countries know only too well the importance of the transatlantic alliance for maintaining peace in Europe. But Europe needs to take on more responsibility and share more of the burden within NATO. And Europe needs to be able to act when the Alliance as a whole is not engaged. </p> <p> Last year, led by the Finnish Presidency, the European Union also agreed changes to tighten co-operation between our judicial, law-enforcement and immigration authorities. Cross-border problems such as international crime, illegal immigration and asylum abuse require cross-border solutions. </p> <p> As the new Belgium Government is doing, we must take decisive steps to deal with these problems by combining an overhaul of our immigration services with the reform of asylum and immigration law. </p> <p> The dangers of inaction are clear. When reasonable and tolerant people fail to deal with the genuine concerns raised by these issues, then unreasonable and intolerant people will take their place. </p> <p> Bogus or fraudulent asylum claims are the enemy of the genuine asylum seeker and these issues must be tackled at the national and European level. </p> <p> The European Union is also reforming institutionally in the wake of the Commission's resignation last year and in preparation for enlargement. </p> <p> I have always maintained the view that an efficient, strong and independent Commission working in the service of the whole Union is a basic requirement of successful European development. That is why the Commission reform process led by Neil Kinnock is so important, and why Britain strongly supports the changes underway. </p> <p> Enlargement is also driving institutional reform. We began an intergovernmental conference earlier this month to look at how we can streamline the Commission, and reform voting in the Council to fit an enlarged European Union. </p> <p> But enlargement raises wider questions. In due course, we will need to consider in what circumstances the flexibility outlined at Amersterdam should operate. To consider how we balance the desire to move forward with the desire not to create a two-tier Europe. I am confident common sense can find a way through. </p> <p> And what of democratic legitimacy? </p> <p> How do you prevent an enlarged Union further diluting the link between voters and decision-makers in Europe? </p> <p> The tension here is between pushing forward the development of Europes institutions; and recognising that most of our citizens identify first and foremost with their national governments and national parliaments. </p> <p> This is not the place for a detailed analysis. I would just make two points. The first is that there is a case for examining how we bring a greater understanding and cooperation between national and European institutions, in particular national and European parliaments. Secondly, we need a concerted drive on subsidiarity. As Romano Prodi said in his speech to the European Parliament last week: </p> <p> Europe's citizens are disenchanted and anxious. They have lost faith in the European institutions. They are losing patience with our slow rate of progress in tackling unemployment. The prospect of enlargement divides public opinion between hope and fear hope for stability and progress, fear of a Europe without identity or frontiers. </p> <p> As he said, the answer lies in focusing on what really needs to be done at the EU level and what should be done by the member states or civil society. Together we need to create a new, more democratic form of partnership between the European, national and regional levels in Europe. </p> <p> <strong>Conclusion</strong> </p> <p> So, to conclude: </p> <p> The British on the whole are too pragmatic to believe in visions. </p> <p> But this is, I suppose, my vision of Europe. </p> <p> Free, fair and open. A community of values. </p> <p> Delivering on the potential of a single market every bit as wide and as deep as Americas to generate jobs, prosperity, opportunity. </p> <p> Strengthening Europe's societies and promoting social justice by once again putting full employment at the heart of our common agenda. </p> <p> A beacon of democracy and free enterprise in the world. An international force for stability, for promoting European interests and European values. </p> <p> A Europe that is truly the servant of the people, never their master. Strength based on strong democracy. Acting effectively in the interests of all the people of Europe, and accountable to them.</p>",

But as the EU has matured and taken on more powers, and as the external and internal threats have subsided, the people of Europe have rightly come to expect more of a say in how it is run. The world is changing. The Cold War is over, but we face new threats in the Balkans. from international crime, from global poverty and instability, from the consequences of mass migration. Europe is responding to these new realities. In 1998, Britain and France took the initiative to strengthen Europe's common defences in a way that also strengthens NATO. EU Member States are now looking at ways of enhancing their military capabilities against headline goals. NATO will always remain the cornerstone of European defence. Both of our countries know only too well the importance of the transatlantic alliance for maintaining peace in Europe. But Europe needs to take on more responsibility and share more of the burden within NATO. And Europe needs to be able to act when the Alliance as a whole is not engaged. Last year, led by the Finnish Presidency, the European Union also agreed changes to tighten co-operation between our judicial, law-enforcement and immigration authorities. Cross-border problems such as international crime, illegal immigration and asylum abuse require cross-border solutions. As the new Belgium Government is doing, we must take decisive steps to deal with these problems by combining an overhaul of our immigration services with the reform of asylum and immigration law. The dangers of inaction are clear. When reasonable and tolerant people fail to deal with the genuine concerns raised by these issues, then unreasonable and intolerant people will take their place. Bogus or fraudulent asylum claims are the enemy of the genuine asylum seeker and these issues must be tackled at the national and European level. The European Union is also reforming institutionally in the wake of the Commission's resignation last year and in preparation for enlargement. I have always maintained the view that an efficient, strong and independent Commission working in the service of the whole Union is a basic requirement of successful European development. That is why the Commission reform process led by Neil Kinnock is so important, and why Britain strongly supports the changes underway. Enlargement is also driving institutional reform. We began an intergovernmental conference earlier this month to look at how we can streamline the Commission, and reform voting in the Council to fit an enlarged European Union. But enlargement raises wider questions. In due course, we will need to consider in what circumstances the flexibility outlined at Amersterdam should operate. To consider how we balance the desire to move forward with the desire not to create a two-tier Europe. I am confident common sense can find a way through. And what of democratic legitimacy? How do you prevent an enlarged Union further diluting the link between voters and decision-makers in Europe? The tension here is between pushing forward the development of Europes institutions; and recognising that most of our citizens identify first and foremost with their national governments and national parliaments. This is not the place for a detailed analysis. I would just make two points. The first is that there is a case for examining how we bring a greater understanding and cooperation between national and European institutions, in particular national and European parliaments. Secondly, we need a concerted drive on subsidiarity. As Romano Prodi said in his speech to the European Parliament last week: Europe's citizens are disenchanted and anxious. They have lost faith in the European institutions. They are losing patience with our slow rate of progress in tackling unemployment. The prospect of enlargement divides public opinion between hope and fear hope for stability and progress, fear of a Europe without identity or frontiers. As he said, the answer lies in focusing on what really needs to be done at the EU level and what should be done by the member states or civil society. Together we need to create a new, more democratic form of partnership between the European, national and regional levels in Europe. Conclusion So, to conclude: The British on the whole are too pragmatic to believe in visions. But this is, I suppose, my vision of Europe. Free, fair and open. A community of values. Delivering on the potential of a single market every bit as wide and as deep as Americas to generate jobs, prosperity, opportunity. Strengthening Europe's societies and promoting social justice by once again putting full employment at the heart of our common agenda. A beacon of democracy and free enterprise in the world. An international force for stability, for promoting European interests and European values. A Europe that is truly the servant of the people, never their master. Strength based on strong democracy. Acting effectively in the interests of all the people of Europe, and accountable to them.",

      "trailText": "<p>We all want to give our children as many life skills as possible. It is estimated that there are 1.5bn speakers of English in the world today, and that this number is growing. Our children are part of that future - so how can we help them succeed?</p>",

      "body": "<p>We all want to give our children as many life skills as possible. It is estimated that there are 1.5bn speakers of English in the world today, and that this number is growing. Our children are part of that future - so how can we help them succeed?</p> <p>All children are born with a tremendous desire to learn, to discover, to explore and experiment. Tony Buzan, leading British psychologist, rightly comments that \"a child picks up a language much better than a doctor of philosophy, and is a master of it by the age of three or four\". It is remarkable (and enviable) how quickly a child can progress from communicating by using a string of baby sounds to being able to handle complex grammatical structures.</p> <p>The acquisition of language, according to the linguist Noam Chomsky, can be compared to the development of walking. Just as a child will naturally learn to walk if given the right nourishment and freedom of movement, so he will acquire language if exposed to the right environment. As parents there is a lot we can do to enrich that environment and stimulate our children's natural curiosity, so they become confident and enthusiastic learners.</p> <p>More and more non-native English speakers want to encourage their children to reach a good level of English. However, language is very closely linked with identity, so it is important to take steps to avoid confusion. Wear a funny hat. Put on a special shawl. Do something obviously different to your appearance to let your child know that English is different and that English is fun. Set aside a cosy corner of your home where English activities will take place. You can quickly and simply create a more exciting atmosphere by throwing a colourful blanket over an armchair that your child can associate with \"English time\".</p> <p>Alternatively, choose an outside spot where your child feels safe, warm and secure. I have a large, tatty, friendly-looking basket, overflowing with games, toys and books, which I pull out for these occasions. </p> <p>Children learn in different ways, and will respond most effectively to activities where all the senses are involved. A song or a chant that is accompanied by pictures and actions will be enjoyed and remembered, however complex the structure. There is a wealth of nursery rhymes to choose from, as well as a large number of \"TEFL\" songs that have become popular in the last decade. \"Hokey Cokey\" and \"Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes\" are top favourites. In both of these the children sing and participate with actions - quite strenuous for the adult, but exhilarating and energising for the child.</p> <p>Songs and chants play an important role in language development at various levels. The child enjoys new structures and vocabulary in a relaxed way, and also practises intonation and pronunciation, while becoming familiar with the rhythm of English. I have often found that even in fluent adult speakers the \"music\" of the language is somehow stilted, and the strong stress patterns of the mother tongue come through.</p> <p>Also, when we sing or chant together, we all breathe in time and often feel a sense of unity with the people around us, which is very positive for learning. This contributes to rapport - a very important ingredient in teaching.</p> <p>Young children get bored and fidgety quite quickly, so keep the activities short and varied. At the same time there is a security in establishing a familiar routine as long it isn't too rigid. The secret is to create a balance, and to do this, notice and respond to the child's needs and reactions.</p> <p>A quick game of Simon Says (where the child only obeys commands such as \"jump\" and \"run\" if they are preceded by the words \"Simon says\") sets the scene in a light-hearted and active way. \"Simon\" can then be extended as an English character to introduce new material.</p> <p>Puppets can provide a whole world of experience that can be transferred to language learning, and they can be simple and enjoyable to make. The shape of a person or animal cut out of card stuck on a drinking straw or stick is sufficient for endless role-play games. Make up short dialogues based on your child's experiences, and have a lot of fun practising them, using different voices.</p> <p>Art activities such as making puppets, decorations for festivals, and invitations to parties can all become part of your child's English experience. Most exercises have far more value if there is a genuine reason for doing them, so make the most of special occasions such as birthdays and holidays, by helping your child to make an English card for a friend or relative that will be appreciated.</p> <p>There is also a wide range of published materials available that you and your child can enjoy. All you need is a picture dictionary to play memory games, bingo and guessing games. Videos and CD Roms can be both useful and entertaining, as support material though not as an exclusive teaching tool. Many of them now come complete with activity books with colouring and matching exercises for the pre-reader.</p> <p>Books that have accompanying cassettes with songs and stories are excellent - but look for ones that are really clear. Flashcards can be used as labels for vocabulary that you are teaching, as well as for games such as Pelmanism (finding pairs of cards), and board games can be adapted.</p> <p>Finally, remember that valuing and developing the mother tongue is a sure way of helping your child become successful in a second language. Children who have a rich experience in their first language and are encouraged to enjoy books are often those who do best, as they are able to transfer the necessary skills.</p> <p>Children all have a huge learning potential that needs to be fuelled and not neglected. Pioneers in child development, such as Glen Doman, have inspired many parents to provide their children with the stimuli they need to flourish. Above all, we should try to foster the curiosity that our children have when they are tiny and when, as Doman says, \"they believe that learning is the greatest game of all\". </p> <p> <strong>Recommended material</strong></p> <p>A variety of picture dictionaries, flashcards, song books with cassettes and CD Roms are available from <a href=\"http://www.longman-elt.com\">Pearson Education</a>. The BBC also has a good range of CD Roms as well as a new course, <a href=\"http://www.bbcworldwide.com/brands/Ozmo.asp\">Ozmo</a>, which comes complete with video, tapes and books.</p> <p>\u0095 Izabella Hearn teaches at King's College Madrid, Spain.

      "bodyText": "We all want to give our children as many life skills as possible. It is estimated that there are 1.5bn speakers of English in the world today, and that this number is growing. Our children are part of that future - so how can we help them succeed? All children are born with a tremendous desire to learn, to discover, to explore and experiment. Tony Buzan, leading British psychologist, rightly comments that \"a child picks up a language much better than a doctor of philosophy, and is a master of it by the age of three or four\". It is remarkable (and enviable) how quickly a child can progress from communicating by using a string of baby sounds to being able to handle complex grammatical structures. The acquisition of language, according to the linguist Noam Chomsky, can be compared to the development of walking. Just as a child will naturally learn to walk if given the right nourishment and freedom of movement, so he will acquire language if exposed to the right environment. As parents there is a lot we can do to enrich that environment and stimulate our children's natural curiosity, so they become confident and enthusiastic learners. More and more non-native English speakers want to encourage their children to reach a good level of English. However, language is very closely linked with identity, so it is important to take steps to avoid confusion. Wear a funny hat. Put on a special shawl. Do something obviously different to your appearance to let your child know that English is different and that English is fun. Set aside a cosy corner of your home where English activities will take place. You can quickly and simply create a more exciting atmosphere by throwing a colourful blanket over an armchair that your child can associate with \"English time\". Alternatively, choose an outside spot where your child feels safe, warm and secure. I have a large, tatty, friendly-looking basket, overflowing with games, toys and books, which I pull out for these occasions. Children learn in different ways, and will respond most effectively to activities where all the senses are involved. A song or a chant that is accompanied by pictures and actions will be enjoyed and remembered, however complex the structure. There is a wealth of nursery rhymes to choose from, as well as a large number of \"TEFL\" songs that have become popular in the last decade. \"Hokey Cokey\" and \"Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes\" are top favourites. In both of these the children sing and participate with actions - quite strenuous for the adult, but exhilarating and energising for the child. Songs and chants play an important role in language development at various levels. The child enjoys new structures and vocabulary in a relaxed way, and also practises intonation and pronunciation, while becoming familiar with the rhythm of English. I have often found that even in fluent adult speakers the \"music\" of the language is somehow stilted, and the strong stress patterns of the mother tongue come through. Also, when we sing or chant together, we all breathe in time and often feel a sense of unity with the people around us, which is very positive for learning. This contributes to rapport - a very important ingredient in teaching. Young children get bored and fidgety quite quickly, so keep the activities short and varied. At the same time there is a security in establishing a familiar routine as long it isn't too rigid. The secret is to create a balance, and to do this, notice and respond to the child's needs and reactions. A quick game of Simon Says (where the child only obeys commands such as \"jump\" and \"run\" if they are preceded by the words \"Simon says\") sets the scene in a light-hearted and active way. \"Simon\" can then be extended as an English character to introduce new material. Puppets can provide a whole world of experience that can be transferred to language learning, and they can be simple and enjoyable to make. The shape of a person or animal cut out of card stuck on a drinking straw or stick is sufficient for endless role-play games. Make up short dialogues based on your child's experiences, and have a lot of fun practising them, using different voices. Art activities such as making puppets, decorations for festivals, and invitations to parties can all become part of your child's English experience. Most exercises have far more value if there is a genuine reason for doing them, so make the most of special occasions such as birthdays and holidays, by helping your child to make an English card for a friend or relative that will be appreciated. There is also a wide range of published materials available that you and your child can enjoy. All you need is a picture dictionary to play memory games, bingo and guessing games. Videos and CD Roms can be both useful and entertaining, as support material though not as an exclusive teaching tool. Many of them now come complete with activity books with colouring and matching exercises for the pre-reader. Books that have accompanying cassettes with songs and stories are excellent - but look for ones that are really clear. Flashcards can be used as labels for vocabulary that you are teaching, as well as for games such as Pelmanism (finding pairs of cards), and board games can be adapted. Finally, remember that valuing and developing the mother tongue is a sure way of helping your child become successful in a second language. Children who have a rich experience in their first language and are encouraged to enjoy books are often those who do best, as they are able to transfer the necessary skills. Children all have a huge learning potential that needs to be fuelled and not neglected. Pioneers in child development, such as Glen Doman, have inspired many parents to provide their children with the stimuli they need to flourish. Above all, we should try to foster the curiosity that our children have when they are tiny and when, as Doman says, \"they believe that learning is the greatest game of all\". Recommended material A variety of picture dictionaries, flashcards, song books with cassettes and CD Roms are available from Pearson Education. The BBC also has a good range of CD Roms as well as a new course, Ozmo, which comes complete with video, tapes and books. \u0095 Izabella Hearn teaches at King's College Madrid, Spain.

      "body": "<p>For most teachers even the best text books will never meet all their needs. Good teachers will always want to supplement the course book with other materials. They use such materials to extend what their students can do - to stimulate discussion, to enrich vocabulary, to increase understanding of how language works. But teachers are usually short of time, and it takes time to find the right texts and the right examples.</p> <p>So imagine a situation in which you want to prepare supplementary materials to help your students extend the ways in which they give examples: they know about \"for example\", but you want to encourage them to start using alternative structures like: superordinate plus \"such as\" plus further examples. </p> <p>How long would it take you to prepare an activity similar to the one linked to below (Activity 1: such as) - half an hour, two hours? With the right resources, it took me less than five minutes. If you want to do the same, you will be one of a growing number of teachers who are using corpus resources to inform and extend their teaching. To start using corpora in your classroom you need three basic resources. The first is a collection of electronically held texts, otherwise known as a corpus, and one way to create this is by using the email edition of the Guardian Weekly (Tap into the Guardian Weekly's mine of email words, November 18). The second is a reasonably powerful computer, and the third is the right kind of software. </p> <p>All Guardian Weekly subscribers who access the email edition have the first two of these resources, but readers will probably not have the other piece of software: a program called a concordancer. Concordancers offer the best means for investigating a collection of texts and creating practical language learning activities. Two reasonably priced and readily available programs are now on the market for around $80 (MonConc Pro from Athelstan Press, and Wordsmith Tools from Oxford University Press), so that problem is easily solved. A concordancer offers at least two distinct tools for looking at a corpus of texts. The first lets you make lists of all the words in the texts you are studying. This is invaluable as it immediately lets you see the most frequent and the least frequent words in your text collection. The second tool lets you display in context any word or phrase you might be interested. We have already seen how \"such as\" could be investigated. As another example, consider a group of business English students at upper-intermediate level who have been having problems with the difference between \"cost\" and \"price\". With a collection of Guardian Weekly email texts on my computer it was simple to prepare two different supplementary tasks to help them. In the first the students were given a print-out of 100 concordance lines containing the two words in question, and were asked to develop their own rules about cost and price.</p> <p>They came up with a good general rule that you can control a price (prices are decisions) but a cost is often outside your control. They then applied this rule to decide which verb would be more appropriate in a number of contexts (see Activity 2).</p> <p>On a matter of design, you will notice how Activity 1 uses the default layout for a concordance printout (often called \"KWIC\" - Key Word In Context), and this second one uses a conventional sentence layout. Each has its advantages, but traditional sentence concordances can be a good starting point for students as they are a little less intimidating. And the result? A group of students with a much clearer idea of how these two words work.</p> <p>These examples offer only a very brief introduction to the potential of corpora in language teaching - what concordance specialist Tim Johns at Birmingham university in Britain calls Data-Driven Learning. If you are interested in finding out more, and have access to the internet, you may also want to visit the British National Corpus site to find out about other text resources or Mike Barlow's Corpus Home Page.

      "bodyText": "For most teachers even the best text books will never meet all their needs. Good teachers will always want to supplement the course book with other materials. They use such materials to extend what their students can do - to stimulate discussion, to enrich vocabulary, to increase understanding of how language works. But teachers are usually short of time, and it takes time to find the right texts and the right examples. So imagine a situation in which you want to prepare supplementary materials to help your students extend the ways in which they give examples: they know about \"for example\", but you want to encourage them to start using alternative structures like: superordinate plus \"such as\" plus further examples. How long would it take you to prepare an activity similar to the one linked to below (Activity 1: such as) - half an hour, two hours? With the right resources, it took me less than five minutes. If you want to do the same, you will be one of a growing number of teachers who are using corpus resources to inform and extend their teaching. To start using corpora in your classroom you need three basic resources. The first is a collection of electronically held texts, otherwise known as a corpus, and one way to create this is by using the email edition of the Guardian Weekly (Tap into the Guardian Weekly's mine of email words, November 18). The second is a reasonably powerful computer, and the third is the right kind of software. All Guardian Weekly subscribers who access the email edition have the first two of these resources, but readers will probably not have the other piece of software: a program called a concordancer. Concordancers offer the best means for investigating a collection of texts and creating practical language learning activities. Two reasonably priced and readily available programs are now on the market for around $80 (MonConc Pro from Athelstan Press, and Wordsmith Tools from Oxford University Press), so that problem is easily solved. A concordancer offers at least two distinct tools for looking at a corpus of texts. The first lets you make lists of all the words in the texts you are studying. This is invaluable as it immediately lets you see the most frequent and the least frequent words in your text collection. The second tool lets you display in context any word or phrase you might be interested. We have already seen how \"such as\" could be investigated. As another example, consider a group of business English students at upper-intermediate level who have been having problems with the difference between \"cost\" and \"price\". With a collection of Guardian Weekly email texts on my computer it was simple to prepare two different supplementary tasks to help them. In the first the students were given a print-out of 100 concordance lines containing the two words in question, and were asked to develop their own rules about cost and price. They came up with a good general rule that you can control a price (prices are decisions) but a cost is often outside your control. They then applied this rule to decide which verb would be more appropriate in a number of contexts (see Activity 2). On a matter of design, you will notice how Activity 1 uses the default layout for a concordance printout (often called \"KWIC\" - Key Word In Context), and this second one uses a conventional sentence layout. Each has its advantages, but traditional sentence concordances can be a good starting point for students as they are a little less intimidating. And the result? A group of students with a much clearer idea of how these two words work. These examples offer only a very brief introduction to the potential of corpora in language teaching - what concordance specialist Tim Johns at Birmingham university in Britain calls Data-Driven Learning. If you are interested in finding out more, and have access to the internet, you may also want to visit the British National Corpus site to find out about other text resources or Mike Barlow's Corpus Home Page. For teachers who are not on the Net, the Newsletter of the IATEFL Computer Special Interest Group has a number of articles which relate to the uses of corpora and ELT. For more information Athelstan Press Oxford University Press Tim Johns's home page has many useful examples of concordance exercises British National Corpus Mike Barlow IATEFL \u0095 Dr Christopher Tribble is a freelance consultant in applied Linguistics.

Like A Beacon In London every now and then I get this craving for my mother's food I leave art galleries in search of plantains saltfish / sweet potatoes I need this link I need this touch of home swinging my bag like a beacon against the cold \u0095 Like A Beacon, \u00a9 Grace Nichols 1984, extracted from The Fat Black Woman's Poems, Virago, \u00a34.99.

He was once photographed jogging through the streets of New York during a -17C cold snap.

After the general election, Germaine Greer memorably identified the 46-year-old's most remarkable feature to be his \"chaotic dentistry\", but in all other respects, he can match Haider's mail-order athleticism. Blair is a man who favours outdoor photo opportunities involving Tuscan scenery before which he can strike a tanned and relaxed pose. He favours the understated chic of Paul Smith. </p> <p><b> Style </b><br> </p> <p> <b> JH:</b> Haider has a creepy way of referring to himself in the third person: for example, \"if Blair is not extreme, then nor is Haider\", which may be an indication of his titanic ego, a glitch in his English, or a symptom of some deeper estrangement. He has a weakness for attempting yoof-speak when addressing the common people, and likes to boast that 35% of voters under 30 voted for his party in last year's general election. \"If you accompany him to an election meeting, he will speak more dialect and his language will be a little rougher,\" says Professor Melanie Sully of the Diplomatic Academy in Vienna. </p> <p> <b> TB:</b> He may not have run marathons, but he has proved himself handy with a tennis racket and, in the honeymoon period after the election, was filmed bouncing a football on his head, quiff whipping in the breeze. He looks his age, but Cherie's pregnancy has rejuvenated his image whilst delivering a powerful message to would-be aggressors about the state of his virility. He has a weakness for attempting Estuary English when addressing the common people or Des O'Connor. </p> <p><b>On family values </b><br> </p> <p> <b> JH:</b> \"For the FPO, the family is the most important anchor in the community, where children are prepared for life and learn to differentiate between right and wrong.\" Haider has two grown daughters and a wife, Claudia, thought to be more liberal in outlook than her husband. </p> <p> <b> TB:</b> \"Strong families cherished by a strong community: that is our national moral purpose.\" Blair has three school-age children and a wife, Cherie, thought to be more liberal in outlook than her husband. </p> <p><b>On law and order </b><br> </p> <p> <b> JH:</b> \"The FPO and Labour support law and order,\" Haider asserts, \"since those who adhere to the fundamental principles of our society deserve our protection.\" </p> <p> <b> TB:</b> Last August, the Government proposed giving Whitehall access to all personal bank accounts, confidential medical records and individual tax files to ease the crackdown on fraud. Civil liberties groups immediately labelled it \"Big Brother Britain\", but they had missed the point. \"The exchange of information poses no threat to the law-abiding citizen,\" said a senior government source, sinisterly. </p> <p><b> Ideology </b><br> </p> <p> <b> JH:</b> Haider has floated to the top of Austrian politics because, he says, he is \"free of ideological ballast\". He identifies with Blair in this, claiming that they stand shoulder to shoulder for \"equal opportunity, fairness, responsibility and trust\". He is sceptical of old right/left definitions, preferring to hack out a new, third way through the jungle of tired old ideologues. It is a passage so radically unshackled to the past that Haider has made the ambitious claim to be working in a society \"without taboos\". </p> <p>Even more remarkably, he has realised his boast. In 1991, Haider broke the ultimate political taboo by identifying with Hitler. \"The Third Reich had a sound employment policy,\" he said before venturing that Waffen SS veterans were men of \"good character\". His thoughts on the taboos of child abuse, bestiality and spitting at old ladies are yet to be recorded. </p> <p> <b> TB:</b> \"Let the courage of past generations, their devotion to duty and their loyalty to family and friends inspire us,\" wrote Tony Blair in his first official address over the internet, skilfully combining scorn for the past with the sentimentality of a wartime poster campaign. He is also tired of slavish political definitions and would like everyone to, you know, lighten up or perhaps even get real. \"It is time to move beyond the social indifference of right and left, libertarian nonsense masquerading as freedom,\" he has said. This bid for freedom has had the unfortunate effect of winning him comparison to some of the great despots of the 20th century. \"In the last few months alone, I've been compared to Hitler, Mussolini and Milosevic,\" Blair admitted recently. </p> <p><b> On welfare </b><br> </p> <p> <b> JH:</b> Haider doesn't mince words when it comes to benefit scroungers, saying there should be \"no taxpayers' money for criminals or wasted money on social welfare.\" Moreover, the unemployed should not be \"encouraged to be inactive through state assistance\", but rather to override their lazy instincts and enter the job market. \"Without freedom there can be no social security,\" says Haider, \"and without social security there can be no freedom.\" It is safe to assume that, in this context, work brings freedom. </p> <p> <b> TB:</b> \"Welfare reform goes to the heart of what Labour stands for,\" said Blair after the election. \"It is the issue on which our government will be judged.\" Since then, widows benefits have been cut, \u00a3300m has been knocked off the cost of lone parent aid and the New Deal threat to withdraw benefits from those refusing jobs and training has been extended to the over-25s. Last May, 67 Labour MPs revolted during the vote for Blair's Welfare Reform Bill, which proposed to cut incapacity benefit for new claimants and restrict entitlement to those who had not paid sufficient National Insurance contributions. But in the spirit of tolerance for which his government will indeed be remembered, the cuts applied only to those who were \"80% disabled or less\". </p> <p><b> On Europe </b><br> </p> <p> <b> JH:</b> Haider calls himself a European and claims to have a \"positive attitude towards Europe\", which includes tightening the laws on immigration and maintaining a healthy scepticism towards foreigners. These policies have had the all too rare effect of provoking a reaction from Arnold Schwarzenegger, who as an immigrant to the US says he felt \"hurt\" by Haider's anti-foreigner remarks. </p> <p> <b> TB:</b> The home office handling of victims fresh off the hijacked Afghan Boeing 727 took more cues from the Sun's \"chancers trying to gate crash our shores\" headline than was admirable, civil rights observers have said. Last year, the government's immigration and asylum bill advocated stricter border controls, tougher sanctions against illegal residents and greater use of deportation. Afghan asylum-seekers were interviewed without legal representation (a perfectly legal practice) and Jack Straw voiced the hope that \"as many as possible would be removed from Britain\".

Fernando Buesa, the Socialist party spokesman in the Basque parliament, was walking past the car with his bodyguard, a member of the regional police force, when a massive explosion sent his body flying 30m (100ft). Attempts to resuscitate them were broadcast live on Spanish state television by a camera crew that had been covering a press conference given by the Basque regional president in his office nearby. The attack took place near Buesa's home in the university campus area of Vitoria, the Basque capital. Students raced out onto the playing fields where the victims' bodies lay, to gape in horror at the scene. \"The windows of the classroom shook,\" said one. \"We knew they'd let off a bomb.\" Buesa, who was married with three children, was known to have been on ETA's hitlist. His death came one month after an army colonel was killed in Madrid by a car bomb detonated by remote control. A similar method is thought to have been used in yesterday's attack. Earlier, Spain's interior minister, Jaime Mayor Oreja, had warned that ETA would almost certainly strike again before the general election on March 12. Politicians from all parties, led by the centre-right prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, cancelled campaign events in a gesture of respect and mourning. The two car-bombings, the first successful terrorist attacks since June 1998, followed a prolonged ceasefire which ended last November after direct talks between the government and ETA failed to agree any terms for securing a lasting peace. Mr Aznar had authorised a meeting with the separatists but ruled out any concessions. Basques were free to pursue their aim of a separate state through institutions set up under Spain's constitution that made the country one of the most devolved in Europe. But his position angered the Basque Nationalist party (PNV), which had persuaded the guerrillas to declare a ceasefire. It promised to work with them to achieve the formal recognition of Basque's right to self-determination. The Basque regional president, Juan Jose Ibarretxe, a member of the PNV, was under pressure yesterday to cease cooperation in the regional parliament with ETA's political wing, Herri Batasuna. A total of 772 people have died as a result of ETA violence since the group began its terror campaign in 1968. Public revulsion at ETA's tactics has grown, and yesterday's attack was expected to provoke demonstrations throughout Spain similar to those which followed last month's bombing. The choice of victim may have been meant as a warning to the PNV, which had been inching closer to the Socialist party.",

      "body": "<p>The driver of one of the trains involved in the Ladbroke Grove crash was thrown from his cab by the impact, and his body was recovered yards away alongside tangled wreckage, a Westminster inquest was told yesterday.</p> <p>Michael Hodder was driving a three-carriage Thames scheduled service from Paddington to Bedwyn. Shortly after 8.10am it collided with a First Great Western train from Cheltenham to Paddington travelling in the opposite direction.</p> <p>The Thames train was attempting to join the main line away from London, which meant crossing the path of the intercity service. The Thames train is believed to have passed through a red signal.</p> <p>On the second day of the inquest into the deaths of 31 people in the crash on October 5 last year, the jury heard that a detailed pathology report revealed that Mr Hodder, 31, had not used alcohol or drugs before the crash.</p> <p>Mr Hodder, who was married with two children and lived in Reading, died instantly. The driver of the Great Western train, Brian Cooper, was also killed.</p> <p>The jury heard that many of those killed had to be identified by dental records, or in some cases DNA testing. In some cases, there was a considerable delay in recovering bodies from the scene, two miles outside Paddington station, and transferring them to a temporary mortuary.</p> <p>The body of Martin King, 41, a company director travelling in the second coach of the Thames train, was not taken to the mortuary until 21 hours after it was discovered.</p> <p>Questioned by solicitors acting for Mr King's family, Detective Chief Inspector Guy Ferguson said that rescue teams \"were under considerable pressure\", and that specialist cutting equipment had been required to extract bodies from the carriage.</p> <p>The body of Antonio Lacovara, 24, was recovered between two coaches of the Great Western Train. Asked why Mr Lacovara had remained in the carriage for so long, Mr Ferguson said it had been difficult to extract the bodies as many were dismembered. It had been imperative to remove them and associated belongings to assist police in identifying the victims.</p> <p>Later Robin Kellow, whose daughter, Elaine, 24, was thrown from the rear coach of the Thames train and crushed by another carriage, attacked Railtrack for what he described as a \"negligent\" track layout at Ladbroke Grove. Ms Kellow was the only person in the rear coach of the Thames train to die.</p> <p>\"I and all the bereaved want something positive and lasting to come from this slaughter, but our history of these events holds out little hope,\" he said.</p> <p>As he continued his attack, the coroner, Paul Knapman, asked that he confine his comments to his daughter. A police investigation into the accident is continuing, and a public inquiry chaired by Lord Cullen is expected to begin hearing evidence next month.</p> <p>The inquest resumes today.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The driver of one of the trains involved in the Ladbroke Grove crash was thrown from his cab by the impact, and his body was recovered yards away alongside tangled wreckage, a Westminster inquest was told yesterday. Michael Hodder was driving a three-carriage Thames scheduled service from Paddington to Bedwyn. Shortly after 8.10am it collided with a First Great Western train from Cheltenham to Paddington travelling in the opposite direction. The Thames train was attempting to join the main line away from London, which meant crossing the path of the intercity service. The Thames train is believed to have passed through a red signal. On the second day of the inquest into the deaths of 31 people in the crash on October 5 last year, the jury heard that a detailed pathology report revealed that Mr Hodder, 31, had not used alcohol or drugs before the crash. Mr Hodder, who was married with two children and lived in Reading, died instantly. The driver of the Great Western train, Brian Cooper, was also killed. The jury heard that many of those killed had to be identified by dental records, or in some cases DNA testing. In some cases, there was a considerable delay in recovering bodies from the scene, two miles outside Paddington station, and transferring them to a temporary mortuary. The body of Martin King, 41, a company director travelling in the second coach of the Thames train, was not taken to the mortuary until 21 hours after it was discovered. Questioned by solicitors acting for Mr King's family, Detective Chief Inspector Guy Ferguson said that rescue teams \"were under considerable pressure\", and that specialist cutting equipment had been required to extract bodies from the carriage. The body of Antonio Lacovara, 24, was recovered between two coaches of the Great Western Train. Asked why Mr Lacovara had remained in the carriage for so long, Mr Ferguson said it had been difficult to extract the bodies as many were dismembered. It had been imperative to remove them and associated belongings to assist police in identifying the victims. Later Robin Kellow, whose daughter, Elaine, 24, was thrown from the rear coach of the Thames train and crushed by another carriage, attacked Railtrack for what he described as a \"negligent\" track layout at Ladbroke Grove. Ms Kellow was the only person in the rear coach of the Thames train to die. \"I and all the bereaved want something positive and lasting to come from this slaughter, but our history of these events holds out little hope,\" he said. As he continued his attack, the coroner, Paul Knapman, asked that he confine his comments to his daughter. A police investigation into the accident is continuing, and a public inquiry chaired by Lord Cullen is expected to begin hearing evidence next month. The inquest resumes today.",

      "body": "<p>They are the men against the machine. One is a decorated Vietnam vet with a lightning temper, the other a newt-fancier with a talent for the one-liner. One talks proudly of his PoW past as a guest in the Hanoi Hilton - \"a hotel where they didn't leave a mint on the pillow\" - another brags of his time as the red bogeyman of Conservative nightmares. One is fresh from last night's expected victory in Arizona and up-to-the-wire clash in Michigan, the other mulls his options in Brent East. One is John McCain, the other is Ken Livingstone - and they are playing a remarkably similar game. Both are on a quest which, if they succeed, could change the way politics is done forever.</p> <p>Presidential candidate McCain is mounting a double challenge: both his message and his method are rebellions against the system. The Republican's signature theme is the corruption of American politics, thanks to the corporate givers and the \"special interests\" - the lobbies who offer hefty donations in return for friendly decisions from Washington. He says his target is this \"iron triangle\" of lobbyists, cash and legislation. That's why he has spent 14 years in the senate pushing for campaign finance reform: until that's fixed, says McCain, the whole system is broken. With the candour that has become his trademark, the former Navy flyer talks like a real-life Bulworth - Warren Beatty's fantasy politician who shocks America by suddenly telling the truth. He asks audiences why they don't have a decent health care system. \"Because the Democrats take money from the trial lawyers and we take money from the insurance companies,\" explains McCain, happily lambasting his own party. Until all the politicians wean themselves off the milk of corporate cash, he says, America's biggest problems will remain unsolved.</p> <p>The form of the campaign reflects its content. John McCain is the insurgent daring to take on the entire Republican establishment, lined up behind George W Bush: the countless governors, mayors and party bigs who are determined to see that Prince George gets his birthright. Bush has the money, a colossal $70m of it, as well as grass roots organisation on loan from party bosses in almost every one of the 50 states. Michigan was a classic case. The Republican governor there, John Engler, behaved like an old-time machine pol calling in the favours. So when a Michigan law firm was asked to turn over its offices this weekend - allowing Bush volunteers to use it for tele phone canvassing - they knew better than to say no to the man who runs the state. One Detroit suburb loyal to Engler had 560 people working in shifts on 300 phones to get out the Bush vote: McCain, by contrast, had 25 volunteers making calls from home.</p> <p>Ken Livingstone must know that a similar disadvantage awaits him. If he seeks the London mayoralty as an independent, he will be a lone soldier fighting not one but three party machines - with Labour, the Lib Dems and the Tories all training their organisational fire on him. He will be the one playing to the packed houses, the one gaining the loudest applause on the hustings. But he will lack the boring nuts and bolts which make up a political machine - and which get results.</p> <p>For this is one of the paradoxes of politics: you can be the most exciting and inspiring candidate on the stump and still lose. In the US, Gary Hart set pulses racing in 1984, but lost the Democratic race to the machine man Walter Mondale. Pat Buchanan catalysed a revolt of \"peasants with pitchforks\" in 1996, but the Republican nomination still went to the charismatically-deprived creature of the establishment, Bob Dole. Ross Perot caught a national mood in 1992 but he was squeezed out, partly by his own self-destructive behaviour, but chiefly by the organisational might of the two main parties. In Britain we know what happens when new groups try to break out of the box. Incredibly, the last new party to become a permanent feature of the British political landscape is Labour, which celebrates its 100th birthday at the weekend. The Social Democrats created huge momentum in the early 1980s, a genuine buzz of excitement, but still they failed - beaten back by Labour at its most demoralised. Even on its knees, Labour still enjoyed the advantage that matters: the machine.</p> <p>Both the Livingstone and McCain revolts are throwing down a challenge: does it always have to be this way? There is certainly an appetite for change. After all, a huge chunk of both men's appeal is their underdog status: vote for them and it's one in the eye for the big boys. There is a rebellious streak in both British and American culture, and these candidates know how to tap it. \"I'm just like Luke Skywalker trying to get out of the Death Star,\" cries the Star Wars fan who would be president. \"Everybody's against me. Governor Engler, Governor Bush, all the governors, all the senators. They're shooting at me from everywhere!\" Less dramatically, Ken never misses a chance to boast that \"I'm my own man\".</p> <p>Can independents like them ever win? Not under the old rules. But the new politics of the 21st century offers a gleam of hope. When McCain whipped Bush by 19 points in New Hampshire he raised $2m in instant cash - via the internet. Friends of Livingstone admit an indie campaign would have to rely less on door-knocking than on radio phone-ins and TV appearances. In both the London mayor's race and the Republican primaries, new technology and new media suggest a way the candidates can defy the juggernaut.</p> <p>In Britain, this change need not be confined to Ken. If he wins, independents will try to follow his lead by seeking mayors' jobs (if they happen) in Liverpool, Birmingham or Manchester. The constraining embrace of the party - which values uniformity above all - would be cast aside, replaced by a variety pack of candidacies, each one tailored to the specific constituency it sought to win. The old party system would be broken. Disagreements would no longer have to be contained within the fractious coalitions that are the Labour and Tory parties.

      "bodyText": "They are the men against the machine. One is a decorated Vietnam vet with a lightning temper, the other a newt-fancier with a talent for the one-liner. One talks proudly of his PoW past as a guest in the Hanoi Hilton - \"a hotel where they didn't leave a mint on the pillow\" - another brags of his time as the red bogeyman of Conservative nightmares. One is fresh from last night's expected victory in Arizona and up-to-the-wire clash in Michigan, the other mulls his options in Brent East. One is John McCain, the other is Ken Livingstone - and they are playing a remarkably similar game. Both are on a quest which, if they succeed, could change the way politics is done forever. Presidential candidate McCain is mounting a double challenge: both his message and his method are rebellions against the system. The Republican's signature theme is the corruption of American politics, thanks to the corporate givers and the \"special interests\" - the lobbies who offer hefty donations in return for friendly decisions from Washington. He says his target is this \"iron triangle\" of lobbyists, cash and legislation. That's why he has spent 14 years in the senate pushing for campaign finance reform: until that's fixed, says McCain, the whole system is broken. With the candour that has become his trademark, the former Navy flyer talks like a real-life Bulworth - Warren Beatty's fantasy politician who shocks America by suddenly telling the truth. He asks audiences why they don't have a decent health care system. \"Because the Democrats take money from the trial lawyers and we take money from the insurance companies,\" explains McCain, happily lambasting his own party. Until all the politicians wean themselves off the milk of corporate cash, he says, America's biggest problems will remain unsolved. The form of the campaign reflects its content. John McCain is the insurgent daring to take on the entire Republican establishment, lined up behind George W Bush: the countless governors, mayors and party bigs who are determined to see that Prince George gets his birthright. Bush has the money, a colossal $70m of it, as well as grass roots organisation on loan from party bosses in almost every one of the 50 states. Michigan was a classic case. The Republican governor there, John Engler, behaved like an old-time machine pol calling in the favours. So when a Michigan law firm was asked to turn over its offices this weekend - allowing Bush volunteers to use it for tele phone canvassing - they knew better than to say no to the man who runs the state. One Detroit suburb loyal to Engler had 560 people working in shifts on 300 phones to get out the Bush vote: McCain, by contrast, had 25 volunteers making calls from home. Ken Livingstone must know that a similar disadvantage awaits him. If he seeks the London mayoralty as an independent, he will be a lone soldier fighting not one but three party machines - with Labour, the Lib Dems and the Tories all training their organisational fire on him. He will be the one playing to the packed houses, the one gaining the loudest applause on the hustings. But he will lack the boring nuts and bolts which make up a political machine - and which get results. For this is one of the paradoxes of politics: you can be the most exciting and inspiring candidate on the stump and still lose. In the US, Gary Hart set pulses racing in 1984, but lost the Democratic race to the machine man Walter Mondale. Pat Buchanan catalysed a revolt of \"peasants with pitchforks\" in 1996, but the Republican nomination still went to the charismatically-deprived creature of the establishment, Bob Dole. Ross Perot caught a national mood in 1992 but he was squeezed out, partly by his own self-destructive behaviour, but chiefly by the organisational might of the two main parties. In Britain we know what happens when new groups try to break out of the box. Incredibly, the last new party to become a permanent feature of the British political landscape is Labour, which celebrates its 100th birthday at the weekend. The Social Democrats created huge momentum in the early 1980s, a genuine buzz of excitement, but still they failed - beaten back by Labour at its most demoralised. Even on its knees, Labour still enjoyed the advantage that matters: the machine. Both the Livingstone and McCain revolts are throwing down a challenge: does it always have to be this way? There is certainly an appetite for change. After all, a huge chunk of both men's appeal is their underdog status: vote for them and it's one in the eye for the big boys. There is a rebellious streak in both British and American culture, and these candidates know how to tap it. \"I'm just like Luke Skywalker trying to get out of the Death Star,\" cries the Star Wars fan who would be president. \"Everybody's against me. Governor Engler, Governor Bush, all the governors, all the senators. They're shooting at me from everywhere!\" Less dramatically, Ken never misses a chance to boast that \"I'm my own man\". Can independents like them ever win? Not under the old rules. But the new politics of the 21st century offers a gleam of hope. When McCain whipped Bush by 19 points in New Hampshire he raised $2m in instant cash - via the internet. Friends of Livingstone admit an indie campaign would have to rely less on door-knocking than on radio phone-ins and TV appearances. In both the London mayor's race and the Republican primaries, new technology and new media suggest a way the candidates can defy the juggernaut. In Britain, this change need not be confined to Ken. If he wins, independents will try to follow his lead by seeking mayors' jobs (if they happen) in Liverpool, Birmingham or Manchester. The constraining embrace of the party - which values uniformity above all - would be cast aside, replaced by a variety pack of candidacies, each one tailored to the specific constituency it sought to win. The old party system would be broken. Disagreements would no longer have to be contained within the fractious coalitions that are the Labour and Tory parties. Instead what are now mere internal factions could break out and run on their own - confident that their lack of a machine would not spell disaster. All that's a long way off. For the moment, the smart, if cautious money says Bush will win the Republican nod and Livingstone will struggle to fulfil his dream. But something will have to give eventually. Bush will have to accommodate the sentiment McCain has voiced; political parties in Britain will have to change. Labour will either have to accept that its \"brand\" means different things in different parts of Britain - that Scottish Labour differs from Welsh Labour which differs again from London Labour - or it will see more breakaways across the country.

      "bodyText": "As someone whose family played a significant part in the creation of the state of Pakistan and continues to serve the country to this day, I find risible the accusation that I am part of an \"Indian lobby\" (Letters, February 19). I am a Pakistani and proud of it. I am sure the present Pakistani government, which has committed itself to deal severely with the endemic corruption in the political and financial life of the country, is able to distinguish between \"Indian lobbies\" (whatever that might mean) and financial malpractise. As the director, producer and co-writer of Jinnah, I believe my film is an emblematic record of the creation of Pakistan and of the life of its founding father. I invite the government of Pakistan to investigate the business of entitlement and accountability concerning the making of the film, through its accountability bureau. There are questions to be answered. The fact that Farrukh Dhondy, Shashi Kapoor and Indira Varma, a writer and two actors of Indian origin, participated in Jinnah refutes the \"Indian lobby\" allegation. On the contrary, it demonstrates that there are leading Indian artists who are willing to play a role in the making of a film which is hardly a piece of subversive Indian propaganda. Surely this collaboration is something to be applauded rather than vilified by scurrilous and chauvinistic innuendoes. This is paranoia masquerading as patriotism.

The generals do not like the rumours that the British army might be asked to take part in a \"ceremony of reconciliation\" with the IRA, whereby each side would hand over a symbolic clutch of weapons.</p> <p>Some, according to yesterday's Times, are even threatening resignation. They say the army cannot countenance any event which establishes a moral equivalence between themselves and the terrorists. And put like that, one can hardly blame them. They are right to see a world of difference between a legal army and an illegal campaign of terror.</p> <p>But none of those who advocate a day of reconciliation - including this newspaper, which was first to revive the suggestion at the start of this month - ever said otherwise. Perhaps some clarification is required. First, this is not a provo scheme. It surfaced first in the Hillsborough agreement between Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, sealed last Easter on the anniversary of the Good Friday agreement. It triggered no rejectionist outcry then: rather it was seen as a good idea which might break the deadlock on decommissioning. It lay dormant until it was revived this month.</p> <p>The fact that the IRA sees some merit in it - perhaps as a face-saving way to make disarmament palatable to hardliners - should not automatically disqualify it.

      "bodyText": "The top brass are said to be in a cold fury. The generals do not like the rumours that the British army might be asked to take part in a \"ceremony of reconciliation\" with the IRA, whereby each side would hand over a symbolic clutch of weapons. Some, according to yesterday's Times, are even threatening resignation. They say the army cannot countenance any event which establishes a moral equivalence between themselves and the terrorists. And put like that, one can hardly blame them. They are right to see a world of difference between a legal army and an illegal campaign of terror. But none of those who advocate a day of reconciliation - including this newspaper, which was first to revive the suggestion at the start of this month - ever said otherwise. Perhaps some clarification is required. First, this is not a provo scheme. It surfaced first in the Hillsborough agreement between Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, sealed last Easter on the anniversary of the Good Friday agreement. It triggered no rejectionist outcry then: rather it was seen as a good idea which might break the deadlock on decommissioning. It lay dormant until it was revived this month. The fact that the IRA sees some merit in it - perhaps as a face-saving way to make disarmament palatable to hardliners - should not automatically disqualify it. On the contrary, if people are genuinely keen to see a handover of guns, they would surely seize on this as part of the choreography which might help achieve that outcome. Second, nobody has suggested anything so tacky as a \"ceremony\" where British and IRA bullets would be thrown on to the pyre.

Earlier yesterday, a senior military spokesman also spoke about arriving at \"a formula\" by which Israeli troops could pull out of the self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in the absence of a full-scale agreement. While Gen Eiland refused to say directly that the army had a contingency plan, there have been signals in recent days that the establishment is considering its options should it fail to revive the talks suspended with Syria last month, or to come to an understanding with Lebanon. \"We have some decisions, but I can't say there is a plan,\" he said. The risks of a unilateral withdrawal are high. In recent days, Israeli analysts have outlined scenarios in which the army would be compelled by public opinion to respond with force to any attack on northern villages by Hizbullah guerrillas in south Lebanon. On Monday, however, the prime minister warned US Jewish leaders that an Israeli withdrawal from the security zone in the absence of an agreement might not bring a cessation of hostilities with the Hizbullah militias there. The military spokesman yesterday said Israel's bombing of Lebanese power stations during the upsurge in fighting was a show of strength in advance of the planned withdrawal. \"We believe we have built a better situation for the next couple of weeks or months, hopefully until the day when we have an agreement or other formula to go out of Lebanon,\" the spokesman said.",

This was an easy entree to the subject of Amadou Diallo, shot 19 times by four New York policemen who are now on trial for murder. \"I think it was an outrage,\" said Mr Bradley, hands wide as though he were expecting to receive a basketball, as he once did for a living as a star player for the New York Knicks. \"I feel it. Everybody in this room feels it. I think it was also a tragedy.\" Mr Gore felt it too. \"The Diallo case and the other cases are just heartbreaking,\" he said. They even agreed on what to do about police attitudes to the community: stop \"racial profiling\" - the targeting of black people. This was where the candidates parted. Mr Bradley, jowls working overtime, said: \"I am questioning why you haven't made this happen in the last seven and a half years.\" Mr Gore, executing a two-part left turn from the waist like an articulated lorry, slammed on the brakes: \"You know, racial profiling practically began in New Jersey, Senator Bradley.\" Most commentators gave the verdict in the bout between the two wealthy, middle-aged whites at the cradle of black working-class talent to Mr Gore. It was no accident that the Apollo was chosen as the venue for the only Democratic debate since the New Hampshire primary on February 1. Black support was decisive when Bill Clinton won the 1992 primary in New York.",

      "bodyText": "Accident investigators have discovered an open hatch on the wreck of the Solway Harvester, prompting fears the ship was not watertight when she went down with her seven crew in the Irish sea last month. An interim report reveals that a fish-loading scuttle on the ship's main deck was open and did not have a safety hatch, which could have left the vessel at risk to flooding from high waves. The investigators also discovered that the scallop dredger's life rafts were not properly attached and maintained, and four of the seven crewmen who lost their lives had not undergone basic safety training. The Solway Harvester went down bow first in stormy waters 11 miles from the Isle of Man on January 12, but the marine accident investigation branch safety bulletin says there is no evidence of any collision with the boat. The report's authors have urged the fishing industry to take immediate action to secure the safety of fishermen. They are asking boat owners to ensure that decks are kept watertight, and that life rafts are properly installed and maintained, and to make sure that all crew undergo mandatory basic safety training. The MAIB recommends that in the \"overriding interest of safety\" the maritime and coastguard agency should take immediate action to promote and enforce better safety practices. Skipper Craig Mills, 29, his brother Robin, 33, their cousin David, 17, and fellow crew members David Lyons, 18, Wesley Jolly, 17, John Murphy, 22, and Martin Milligan, 26, from the tiny communities which make up the Machars of Whithorn in the south-west of Scotland, all died when the Solway Harvester sank. A spokesman for the boat's owner said he was abroad and unavailable for comment. Chief inspector of marine accidents John Lang said in the safety bulletin: \"The MAIB's initial inquiries have revealed evidence of several safety shortcomings, which give rise to serious concerns about the safety of all fishing vessels, and particularly for the crews sailing on similar scallop dredgers and other trawlers operating out of Kirkcudbright.\" Hamish Morrison, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, said the report, although welcome, did not explain what had happened to the vessel. The public should not be left with the impression that if the problems highlighted had been resolved the victims would still be alive. \"That's not true because all the crew were found inside the vessel. Whatever happened, happened quickly and was catastrophic.\" Preliminary seabed investigation into the sinking found that the loading scuttle to the fish hold on the main deck was open and did not appear to be fitted with a hatch cover. Life rafts, which are meant to be serviced annually, proved not to have been checked since September 1996. The ends of the rafts were found to be unbroken and heat sealed, which indicates they were not attached to the Solway Harvester when it went down. Mr Lang said: \"The absence of a mayday transmission or any other radio report of trouble, and the subsequent discovery by divers that all seven bodies of the crew were inside the vessel, indicates that whatever happened occurred very rapidly. \"The underwater survey has revealed some hull damage, which, on initial inspection, is consistent with Solway Harvester having impacted the seabed stem first. \"The wreck will be raised and the hull will be examined more closely before this can be confirmed beyond doubt.\" Yesterday the marine and coastguard agency said it had begun to implement the two recommendations directed at it in the report, and through its normal inspection procedures would be checking all fishing vessels with a similar design to the Solway Harvester. A full report is expected later, probably after the boat has been raised.",

Anthony Phillips, of Wolverhampton, was convinced that Lorraine Howell, 34, had corrupted his son Jamie, 17. </p> <p>The electrician, aged 43, climbed over his garden fence and attacked his neighbour with an axe while her two young children were in the house. </p> <p>Mrs Howell, who had separated from her husband, embarked on an affair with Jamie Phillips and gave birth to their child, Lauren, on November 17 1998. Roger Smith QC, prosecuting, said that when the deeply religious father of two heard of this he bought an axe from a hardware shop and began plotting her murder. </p> <p>The affair began soon after Mrs Howell's husband, Peter, left the marital home in August 1997. </p> <p>\"By December 1997, sexual intercourse had occurred on two occasions. </p> <p>\"It did not become a regular thing and as far as Jamie can recollect he only had sex with Lorraine Howell one time after that. </p> <p>\"But Lorraine Howell became pregnant as a result.\" </p> <p>Jamie later told his mother that he was the father. \"She told the defendant and he was outraged.\" </p> <p>Phillips later told police that on May 1 1999 he had seen Mrs Howell's back door was open and entered her house. </p> <p>\"He said Lorraine was coming down the stairs with a bundle of washing in her hands. He said he just swung the axe and it was 'like hitting a piece of rubber. I just basically took the axe and hit her with it repeatedly,' he said.\" </p> <p>Phillips admits manslaughter, but denies murder. </p> <p>The case continues. </p> <p><b>Girl tells of avalanche rescue</b></p> <p>A British teenager yesterday told of the moment when a wall of snow engulfed her at an Austrian ski resort. </p> <p>Alice Reed, from London, who was celebrating her 17th birthday on a family skiing holiday in the Alpine resort of Tauplitz, was rescued by a ski instructor and a family friend also caught in the avalanche on Monday. </p> <p>Miss Reed told ITN: \"I didn't really have time to be scared, but snow was completely covering me. It was in my mouth as well, so it was hard to breathe. My left arm was free so I pushed the snow away from my head and found I was stuck.\" </p> <p>The friend, David Wallace, added: \"I was trapped to my midriff. The ski instructor, who was further down the slope, managed to get herself out, got me out, and then we dug Alice out.\" She was taken to hospital for treatment to minor leg injuries. </p> <p>Police from nearby Bad Mitterndorf said the party was lucky to survive. The guide, Maria Huber, 23, told reporters: \"The snow was all around me up to my shoulders, but because I could see to orientate myself I was able to get free. I was able to dig them out. We were lucky that one of us was free and could see the others.\" </p> <p>Police in Bad Mitterndorf are hunting two snowboarders who they believe started the avalanche by skiing off-piste. Elsewhere, avalanches in ski resorts left six dead - three women in Bolzano, Italy, and another three people in Davos in Switzerland. </p> <p><b>Grade buys Pinewood for \u00a362m</b></p> <p>Pinewood studios in Buckinghamshire saw the end of an era yesterday as its founder and owner, Rank Group, sold the complex to investors led by the former head of Channel 4, Michael Grade. </p> <p>Pinewood, built in the 1930s, was sold for \u00a362m - more than the \u00a350m originally expected. Rank no longer sees Britain's biggest film studio as a core business. On Monday, the company sold its Odeon cinemas chain for \u00a3280m. </p> <p>The move will take Mr Grade back to the heart of the British entertainment world after his three-year stint as chief executive of First Leisure. </p> <p>Mr Grade, speaking from Australia, said: \"People love to film at Pinewood, especially Americans. We want to keep attracting the Hollywood blockbusters but also see more British films, TV programmes and adverts made there.\" </p> <p>The British film industry was set for huge expansion as government initiatives such as tax breaks and national lottery funding took effect, he said. The explosion in the number of cable and satellite television channels and internet sites would bring a further increase in the boom. </p> <p>Mr Grade is receiving backing from the investment group 3i for the deal. He will run the company alongside Ivan Dunleavy, formerly chief executive of a video production company. </p> <p>The most recent figures, for 1998, show Pinewood made an underlying profit of \u00a34.4m on \u00a313.2m of turnover. </p> <p>Dan Adler, one of the directors at 3i who arranged the financing for the deal, said: \"The media business is all about who you know, and after being controller of programmes at the BBC and chief executive at Channel 4, Michael Grade has a contacts book to die for.\" </p> <p>Pinewood will continue wooing the big US movie producers such as Sony, Fox and Warner Brothers, all of which use its studios. </p> <p>As well as 20 studios of various sizes, Pinewood houses dozens of businesses associated with the film industry such as lighting and production outfits. It also has large office facilities, vital for attracting the entourages of staff who work on big budget productions. </p> <p><b>Sky centres beam the way ahead</b></p> <p>Mobile phone masts that disfigure the landscape could one day be replaced with communications platforms floating in the sky, it was disclosed yesterday. </p> <p>A team of British scientists is investigating ways of using airships, balloons or small pilotless aircraft to relay phone, TV and internet signals. </p> <p>The high altitude platforms would fly higher than Concorde but be much closer to the earth than orbiting satellites. </p> <p>Powered by solar panels, they would offer more efficient and cheaper communications than either cellular phone or satellite systems. </p> <p>Research into the platforms has been driven by the explosion in demand for services such as mobile phones, internet access and email. </p> <p>They could deliver all these to both stationary and mobile users, rendering existing ways of connecting with the internet obsolete. </p> <p>They would also be able to cope with large numbers of TV and video channels, and could replace current satellite or cable TV systems. </p> <p>The platforms would be designed to respond to user demands. For instance, they might direct most of their capacity over city centres during the working day, but move their antennae beams out to the suburbs in the evenings. </p> <p>The platforms could also prove useful where there was a sudden need for communications, as in the event of an earthquake or other disaster. </p> <p>Tim Tozer, leader of the communications research group at York university, said: \"This has colossal potential, and indeed may be the only way we are going to fulfil all the demands for wireless services.\" </p> <p>The York researchers are collaborating with 10 other teams across Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Slovenia, Hungary and the UK. The work is being funded by an EU grant totalling \u00a33m</p> <p><b>Slip did not show Council cleared over landslide</b></p> <p> Scarborough district council has been cleared of blame for the disaster in which one of the North Yorkshire resort's leading hotels slipped off the cliff (pictured above) one morning in June 1993. </p> <p>Lord Justices Stuart-Smith, Schiemann and Tuckey yesterday allowed an appeal court challenge in London by the council against a 1998 high court ruling that it had failed in its legal duty to keep the land between the hotel and the cliff's edge safe. </p> <p>The claim had been brought by Holbeck Hall Hotel Ltd and English Rose Hotels (Yorkshire) Ltd, owners of the four star hotel built in 1880. </p> <p>Lord Justice Stuart-Smith said that it had not been \"just and reasonable\" to impose a liability on Scarborough for the damage. </p> <p>The council in its appeal argued that it could not fairly be said Scarborough knew of the danger. The owners had claimed that the council, if it knew the land was unstable, owed a duty to the owners to take steps to prevent a disaster. </p> <p>The judge said: \"Scarborough have done nothing to create the danger which has arisen by the operation of nature.\" He did not consider that the high court judge who found Scarborough to blame had addressed the question of the extent of the damage that could reasonably have been foreseen.</p> <p><b>Vegetarian 'danger of infertility'</b></p> <p>Vegetarians were warned yesterday that their diet could cause infertility in both men and women. </p> <p>Lack of meat might also create a risk of anaemia and an inability to work due to lack of vital minerals. </p> <p>Margaret Rayman, director of nutritional medicine at Surrey university, said young women were most at risk because they lost iron during menstruation and could not replace it by eating just greens. </p> <p>Dr Rayman said: \"Iron, zinc and copper are readily found in red meat [but] are poorly represented in fruit and vegetables. A shortage of zinc can cause fertility problems particularly among men who secrete large quantities of it in the testes.\" </p> <p>She added: \"Vegetarians could optimise their uptake by drinking orange juice with a meal as it improves the body's absorption of iron.\"</p>",

Lord Justices Stuart-Smith, Schiemann and Tuckey yesterday allowed an appeal court challenge in London by the council against a 1998 high court ruling that it had failed in its legal duty to keep the land between the hotel and the cliff's edge safe. The claim had been brought by Holbeck Hall Hotel Ltd and English Rose Hotels (Yorkshire) Ltd, owners of the four star hotel built in 1880. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith said that it had not been \"just and reasonable\" to impose a liability on Scarborough for the damage. The council in its appeal argued that it could not fairly be said Scarborough knew of the danger. The owners had claimed that the council, if it knew the land was unstable, owed a duty to the owners to take steps to prevent a disaster.

Lack of meat might also create a risk of anaemia and an inability to work due to lack of vital minerals. Margaret Rayman, director of nutritional medicine at Surrey university, said young women were most at risk because they lost iron during menstruation and could not replace it by eating just greens.

The attack, which led to the murder of Dion Holmes, 29, was like something from the \"wild west\", with shots being fired from a 12 bore pump action shotgun and pistol, the Old Bailey was told. Richard Horwell, prosecuting, said Winston Harris, 38, Stephen Murray, 26, Jermaine Hamilton, 22, and Leonard Cole, 27, had gone to the Bridge Park leisure centre last May bent on revenge and retribution because they felt slighted by a rival posse. They were members of a gang called the Lock City Crew which used the leisure centre, near Wembley stadium, as a meeting place and hideout for drugs and ammunition. The shoot-out was provoked after the wife of a member of a rival gang, the Cartel Crew, drove to the centre. A security guard, who was also a member of the LCC, admonished her for poor parking and told her to try again, the court was told. The woman flew into a rage, smashed a bottle and had to be escorted away by the police. She returned 20 minutes later with her husband, infuriating the LCC gang members who thought it showed \"a certain lack of respect to them and their territory\". Mr Horwell added: \"Their hackles rose.

One of them locked the doors of the leisure centre to prevent people from leaving, but their plan to pick off their rival went wrong. Hamilton accidentally fired his shotgun, causing panic and Harris, who has served jail terms in New York for violence, let off another shot in an effort to control the crowd. In the mayhem Mr Holmes, of Streatham, south London, was hit. He was found lying in a pool of blood with a bullet hole through his heart and liver, the court heard. All four men, who are from north London, pleaded not guilty. The court heard they had come here from Jamaica in the mid-1990s and were staying here illegally.

On top of having to admit to being the subject of investigations in the United States, Europe and Australia into alleged price-fixing - and the consequent resignations of its chairman and president - the institution that has spent centuries sizing up the financial cut of a client's jib learned that its own IOUs had been downgraded.</p> <p>Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit-rating agency, marked it down because \"Sotheby's no longer possesses the credit characteristics of an A-category rating\".</p> <p>For an auction house long renowned for its snootiness, this would have been the bitterest of pills. Other than, perhaps, the knowledge that arch-rival Christie's has effectively \"shopped\" Sotheby's to America's much-feared department of justice. Christie's entered an amnesty agreement in return for the goods on alleged price-fixing between these two giants of the auction world between 1995 and 1997.</p> <p>Christie's turned federal evidence in early January, and the reverberations yesterday toppled both Diana Brooks, Sotheby's president since 1994 , and its chairman, Alfred Taubman, the effective owner of the auction house since 1983.</p> <p>His departure raised the question of whether Sotheby's is now up for sale. A spokeswoman in London \"couldn't speculate\" on the company's future, but if the man who once saved Sotheby's from the indignity of a bid from two US felt manufacturers were to sell up, what price would his one-time pride and joy command under the hammer?</p> <p><b> Shares fall</b><br></p> <p>Mrs Brooks - until now the most powerful woman in the art world - is said to have such a head for figures that she can add up sales totals faster than Sotheby's computers. But even those with more modest number-crunching skills were able to work out the importance of the fall in the company's value yesterday.</p> <p>Less than a year ago its shares were worth $47 (\u00a329) each. They opened yesterday at $17.75 and by lunchtime in New York were down to $14.5, the direct result of the criminal investigation.</p> <p>Once the idea of a criminal investigation into the auction house might have seemed as incongruous as the notion of Sotheby's and the internet (on which the house now has a major presence). But it was by email that staff at the auctioneer's new \u00a369m New York headquarters heard the news of the resignations of Mrs Brooks and Mr Taubman. It is believed that the two were helped to make up their minds by a board meeting conducted by telephone.</p> <p>\"No one's rejoicing\", said a New York art lawyer. \"We're waiting for the other shoe to drop. At this point we don't know how seriously these disclosures will affect confidence in the market.\"</p> <p>But Angela Westwater, a contemporary art dealer in the city's SoHo district, said: \"For a lot of people to whom the art world is hype anyway, does it increase their fears and cynicism?\"</p> <p>Sotheby's yesterday admitted that the cost of any settlement with the justice department, added to possible fines by European and Australian regulators and bumped up further by the outcome of 36 class-action suits in the US, could present it with a bill that \"could well have a material impact on Sotheby's financial condition and/or results of operations\".</p> <p>For a company that made \u00a357m profit in 1998 from auction sales totalling nearly \u00a31.2bn, that has to mean that the house is bracing itself for the worst.</p> <p>The root of Sotheby's problems line in the early 1990s, when revenue started to fall as a result of the slump that followed the high-price 1980s. Both Sotheby's and Christie's raised their buyer's premium rates and, three years later Christie's brought in a sliding scale for seller's commissions of 2% to 10%, and Sotheby's followed suit. Smelling a rat, the justice department launched an \"anti-trust\" investigation in 1997, spurred on by the dominance of the two houses, which account for 95% of the \u00a32.5bn global auction business.</p> <p>As the inquiry proceeded, Christie's changed hands, going private in May 1998. In January this year a spokeswoman said: \"Christie's is co-operating with the department of justice and has entered into an amnesty agreement\".</p> <p>Its new chairman is Michael Sovern, a former president of Columbia university and, in the late 1980s, the chairman of an anti-corruption commission which was run jointly by New York's city and state governments.</p> <p><b>Sotherby's</b></p> <p>At Sotheby's, Mrs Brooks is replaced by William Ruprecht , a senior auctioneer and managing director of the house in north and south America since 1994.</p> <p>There were only two crumbs of comfort for Sotheby's last night. One is that Christie's US amnesty does not apply to the inquiries being carried out by Britain's office of fair trading (OFT), by the European commission or by the Australian authorities.</p> <p>And the other is that - whatever penalty Sotheby's faces in the US - it will face none in Britain. Tough new OFT fining powers do not apply to offences committed before March 1.</p> <p><b> Founded:</b> 1744 by Samuel Baker with a book auction.</p> <p><b> Reputation:</b> The world's oldest and, until recently, largest auctioneer known in the trade by its address: New Bond Street.

      "bodyText": "Sotheby's, the oldest and, until recently, the largest auction house in the world, ended one of the worst days in its 256-year history last night with the ultimate ignominy. On top of having to admit to being the subject of investigations in the United States, Europe and Australia into alleged price-fixing - and the consequent resignations of its chairman and president - the institution that has spent centuries sizing up the financial cut of a client's jib learned that its own IOUs had been downgraded. Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit-rating agency, marked it down because \"Sotheby's no longer possesses the credit characteristics of an A-category rating\". For an auction house long renowned for its snootiness, this would have been the bitterest of pills. Other than, perhaps, the knowledge that arch-rival Christie's has effectively \"shopped\" Sotheby's to America's much-feared department of justice. Christie's entered an amnesty agreement in return for the goods on alleged price-fixing between these two giants of the auction world between 1995 and 1997. Christie's turned federal evidence in early January, and the reverberations yesterday toppled both Diana Brooks, Sotheby's president since 1994 , and its chairman, Alfred Taubman, the effective owner of the auction house since 1983. His departure raised the question of whether Sotheby's is now up for sale. A spokeswoman in London \"couldn't speculate\" on the company's future, but if the man who once saved Sotheby's from the indignity of a bid from two US felt manufacturers were to sell up, what price would his one-time pride and joy command under the hammer? Shares fall Mrs Brooks - until now the most powerful woman in the art world - is said to have such a head for figures that she can add up sales totals faster than Sotheby's computers. But even those with more modest number-crunching skills were able to work out the importance of the fall in the company's value yesterday. Less than a year ago its shares were worth $47 (\u00a329) each. They opened yesterday at $17.75 and by lunchtime in New York were down to $14.5, the direct result of the criminal investigation. Once the idea of a criminal investigation into the auction house might have seemed as incongruous as the notion of Sotheby's and the internet (on which the house now has a major presence). But it was by email that staff at the auctioneer's new \u00a369m New York headquarters heard the news of the resignations of Mrs Brooks and Mr Taubman. It is believed that the two were helped to make up their minds by a board meeting conducted by telephone. \"No one's rejoicing\", said a New York art lawyer. \"We're waiting for the other shoe to drop. At this point we don't know how seriously these disclosures will affect confidence in the market.\" But Angela Westwater, a contemporary art dealer in the city's SoHo district, said: \"For a lot of people to whom the art world is hype anyway, does it increase their fears and cynicism?\" Sotheby's yesterday admitted that the cost of any settlement with the justice department, added to possible fines by European and Australian regulators and bumped up further by the outcome of 36 class-action suits in the US, could present it with a bill that \"could well have a material impact on Sotheby's financial condition and/or results of operations\". For a company that made \u00a357m profit in 1998 from auction sales totalling nearly \u00a31.2bn, that has to mean that the house is bracing itself for the worst. The root of Sotheby's problems line in the early 1990s, when revenue started to fall as a result of the slump that followed the high-price 1980s. Both Sotheby's and Christie's raised their buyer's premium rates and, three years later Christie's brought in a sliding scale for seller's commissions of 2% to 10%, and Sotheby's followed suit. Smelling a rat, the justice department launched an \"anti-trust\" investigation in 1997, spurred on by the dominance of the two houses, which account for 95% of the \u00a32.5bn global auction business. As the inquiry proceeded, Christie's changed hands, going private in May 1998. In January this year a spokeswoman said: \"Christie's is co-operating with the department of justice and has entered into an amnesty agreement\". Its new chairman is Michael Sovern, a former president of Columbia university and, in the late 1980s, the chairman of an anti-corruption commission which was run jointly by New York's city and state governments. Sotherby's At Sotheby's, Mrs Brooks is replaced by William Ruprecht , a senior auctioneer and managing director of the house in north and south America since 1994. There were only two crumbs of comfort for Sotheby's last night. One is that Christie's US amnesty does not apply to the inquiries being carried out by Britain's office of fair trading (OFT), by the European commission or by the Australian authorities. And the other is that - whatever penalty Sotheby's faces in the US - it will face none in Britain. Tough new OFT fining powers do not apply to offences committed before March 1. Founded: 1744 by Samuel Baker with a book auction. Reputation: The world's oldest and, until recently, largest auctioneer known in the trade by its address: New Bond Street. Once described as \"businessmen pretending to be gentlemen\". Bought leading US fine-art auctioneer Parke-Bernet in 1964. Is today American-based. Ownership: Bought for \u00a387.2m in 1983 by US shop ping-mall tycoon Alfred Taubman after hostile bid by felt manufacturers Marshall Cogan and Stephen Swid. Recent difficulties: In 1997, an internal inquiry was launched after accusations that staff were involved in trafficking in old masters out of Italy in defiance of Italian law. The previous year, the house seemed to have been caught on the hop by faked works purporting to be examples of the Russian avant-garde. Sales: About \u00a31.19bn. Christies Founded: 1766 by James Christie, friend of the painter Joshua Reynolds. Catherine the Great an early customer. Reputation: Once tagged \"gentlemen pretending to be businessmen\", but emerged as very aggressive player during the lean years of the early 1990s. Ownership: Was quoted on stock market. In 1997, broker SG Warburg Dillon Read was trying to put together a private buyout of booming Christie's, with a consortium of six private individuals including the Bahamas-based tycoon Joseph Lewis, himself one of Christie's best clients.

Mr Morgan is believed to have been quizzed over share transactions in Wiggins, a property and airports group. It was alleged that Mr Morgan bought shares in the company the day before they were tipped in the Mirror by the paper's now-dismissed City Slickers team. Mr Morgan, 34, has been cleared by the paper's parent board, Trinity Mirror, of any wrongdoing over share dealings in two other companies which have been written about by the Slickers team.

It also emerged last night that the Stock Exchange inquiry, which has been passed over to the department of trade and industry, investigated dealings by Mr Morgan in a number of companies. Mr Morgan is understood to have bought the shares in Wiggins at the same time as the Slickers, Anil Bhoyrul and James Hipwell, in October 1998. Shortly after buying the shares the Slickers tipped Wiggins, saying it was \"undervalued\" and was a potential takeover target.

Lord Levy, a multi-millionaire music impresario, paid nine visits to the region last year on behalf of the prime minister, outstripping the foreign secretary, Robin Cook. Downing Street's disclosure of Lord Levy's role, made in a parliamentary written answer after earlier denial, was questioned by the Tories and the Liberal Democrats. Francis Maude, shadow foreign secretary, demanded to know whether Lord Levy, who has substantial business interests in Israel, was acting as a Labour party fundraiser during his trips. \"If this proves to be the case there will be a clear conflict of interest, not to mention a strong hint of impropriety,\" Mr Maude said. Norman Baker, Lib Dem MP for Lewes, who tabled the parliamentary question to the prime minister, said that Mr Blair appeared to be moving towards an American system of awarding foreign policy jobs to party backers. \"It is unacceptable to have someone acting as a minister who is not accountable to parliament,\" Mr Baker said. The prime minister said last night that Lord Levy had visited eight separate middle eastern countries on his behalf, over nine trips, since April last year. In his most recent trip earlier this month, Lord Levy visited Lebanon and Syria. He has also visited Jordan, Lebanon, Eqypt, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain, while making numerous visits to Israel, where he has substantial business interests. In a written parliamentary reply last night, the prime minister said that Lord Levy had paid his own costs, although the foreign office had provided accommodation and advice during some of the trips. Downing Street played down speculation that Lord Levy, who ran the \"blind trust\" which funded Mr Blair's office in opposition, was acting as his personal envoy to the Middle East when his role was first disclosed last year. The foreign office was initially sceptical about Lord Levy, fearing that he was treading on the toes of the former Middle East minister, Geoff Hoon. However, the foreign office is now said to be relaxed about his role. Lord Levy, who plays tennis with the prime minister, established such stars as Alvin Stardust, Chris Rea and the group Bad Manners.",

Almost uniquely, Fiennes remains adamant she wants Clark - or whoever she happens to be dealing with - to be understood through their work rather than the other way around; not for her the hackneyed game of small-screen headshrinking.

      "bodyText": "The Commons' new anti-sleaze atmosphere has led MPs to declare everything from large quantities of free air miles to complementary tickets for Wimbledon. The register of interests published yesterday includes Ann Clwyd, Labour MP for Cynon Valley, and Tess Kingham, Labour MP for Gloucester, declaring 20,000 Virgin air miles given when they were stranded after their transatlantic flights were cancelled. Others admit ringing up Roger Willoughby, the registrar who polices declarations, to make sure they would not be called before Elizabeth Filkin, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, whose investigation led to MPs recommending a month's suspension for Teresa Gorman, Tory MP for Billericay. Tessa Jowell, the employment minister, discloses she and her husband, David Mills, had four years' tax returns done free by a chartered accountants, Chiltern. She told the Guardian: \"Mr Willoughby said it was marginal, but in the present atmosphere it is much better to over declare than under declare.\" John Prescott's office agonised over a free helicopter from Milton Keynes to Silverstone from the Motorsports Association. He had been invited to present the grand prix trophy in his capacity as deputy prime minister. Again, this was ruled as marginal - but he decided to register. Other one-off declarations include Brian Donohue, Labour MP for Cunninghame South, who had his garage built courtesy of Bardon Aggregates.

As the momentum continued to build behind an independent Livingstone campaign, and the government's plans to hold the election without freepost delivery were thrown out by the House of Lords, the release of the embarrassing letters demonstrated that Labour's Millbank headquarters is now convinced that the former Greater London Council leader will go it alone. With the latest ICM poll for the Evening Standard showing that even one in three Tories would vote for Mr Livingstone as an independent, and that most Londoners reject Tony Blair's attempt to brand him an extremist, the party hierarchy is convinced that its best card is to portray the Brent East MP as a man who cannot be trusted. In the exchange of letters between Mr Livingstone and Labour's chairman, Vernon Hince, over Christmas and the new year, Mr Livingstone wrote: \"If Frank Dobson wins the vote in the electoral college, however narrowly, I will support his campaign for mayor.\" Mr Hince demanded first that Mr Livingstone repudiate reports saying he would run as an independent if he won a majority among the Labour membership but lost the electoral college, as has now happened.

      "body": "<p>Noel Annan, who has died aged 83, was a remarkable man. His qualities had a completeness that made him the spokesman of more than one generation. To his intellectual flair and imagination was added considerable experience. After distinguished war service he became a leading academic, a fellow of King's college, Cambridge, and a university lecturer in politics. He went on to become a university leader and administrator, as provost of King's from the early age of 40 (1956-1966); as provost of University College, London (1966-1978); and the first full-time vice-chancellor of the University of London (1978-1981). He held these responsibilities at crucial periods in the history of British universities.</p> <p>He knew periods of expansion and prosperity, as he knew years of stringency and uncertainty. He sat on innumerable committees and chaired most of them. His decisiveness and affability were valuable assets, but much more than this, he was one of the few who sought both to understand and to explain what was happening. He strove to find a philosophy of education.</p> <p>Annan was also a public figure. Once again he presided over councils and committees. He was a director of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden; chairman of the board of trustees of the National Gallery; a trustee of the British Museum; and president of the London Library. There were government bodies, such as the public schools commission, and private bodies, notably the Gulbenkian foundation.</p> <p>He was therefore much in the public eye. At times he attracted attention by making statements which were deliberately resonant. In 1970, for example, he forcefully expressed his opposition to the plans of the Conservative government of Edward Heath to allow public museums and galleries which had hitherto been free, to charge for admission. Why, Annan asked, should someone who worked in a shop be unable to spend some of the lunch break looking round the British Museum or the National Gallery?</p> <p>The prime minister angrily claimed that this was a small matter which had got completely out of hand, and there were those who mocked - and Annan encountered many such in the course of his career - by asking how many shopgirls did Lord Annan know? But the protests succeeded. And for Annan this was not a small matter. His indignation was part of a process in which he devoutedly believed: that of civilising people.</p> <p>He was an accomplished speaker. As an orator fulfilling his duties as provost of King's, when giving the Hobhouse Lecture at Bedford College (1958) or the Romanes Lecture at Oxford (1965), speaking on the television Brains Trust in the 1960s, or performing as the Dimbleby Lecturer on the BBC some years later, he was always impressive. He became a life peer in 1965, and his speeches in the Lords were always carefully prepared and listened to with respect. He often took the chair at public lectures and would frequently conclude proceedings with an anecdote that was better than any of those which the speaker had produced. This always delighted the audience and sometimes the speaker.</p> <p>Noel Annan was educated at Stowe and King's College, Cambridge. He wrote the biography of Stowe's first headmaster, JF Roxburgh (published in 1965), who was also his headmaster. Annan believed that it was during the 1920s that the intelligent public began seriously to doubt whether the accepted principles of the public school were adequate and right. Roxburgh, whom Annan admired, had tried, in his own way, to deal with these demands. And at Cambridge Annan pursued these considerations.</p> <p>Postwar, in the days of Attlee's 1945-51 Labour government, he thought that the university had not paid sufficient attention to what had been happening in schools and in education. He wanted Cambridge to change its attitude. He believed in grammar school boys, and as they adapted themselves to fit in to their new surroundings, they discovered that brains and originality opened doors. Annan believed that in the 1950s it was the manners of the grammar schools that came to predominate. Both public and grammar school boys came to dislike the upper class and their ways.</p> <p>As provost of King's, Annan made an effort to attract boys from the maintained grammar schools. Thirty years later he noted that 54% of the entry to King's came from the comprehensive system and 15% from the few maintained grammars schools that still existed. He believed that comprehensive school students had a greater potential than their public school contemporaries.</p> <p>But, of course, Annan himself belonged to the gilded elite. His own description of how he was recruited, in the war years, and became a member of MI14, a small unit of the military intelligence division of the war office, could not be bettered. It was in December 1940. \"I was lunching with my father at our club, when he introduced me to a member called Carl Sherrington. He was the son of a famous Cambridge physiologist who had won the Nobel prize.\" As a result of this meeting, \"I got a letter telling me to report to a Captain Sanderson at the war office.\" This captain believed that Annan was an expert on railways. He was not, but his father had been associated, some time before 1914, with the Chesapeake and Ohio railway. Hence, Annan was given an important job in operational intelligence studying the movement by rail of German forces. Then, after Germany's surrender, a chance meeting with Bill Cavendish-Bentinck (the future 9th Duke of Portland) led to Annan's appointment to the political division of the British control commission, eventually stationed in Berlin.</p> <p>This is surely the old public school account of how we won the war, a story which accords with Correlli Barnett's view of the British upper class supporting each other as they muddle through. But Annan shows us in his account, Changing Enemies (1995), how the machinery became professional and worked. His book is very far from the traditional story of a man at war. It is the essential Annan. Who else would have begun with a quotation from Troilus and Cressida? Who else would be able to recall a return to Berlin in 1948, when the East Germans were beginning their blockade of the city, and to tell of how he had renewed his student acting days? The Marlowe Society were producing Webster's The White Devil and they invited Annan to play the part of Cardinal Monticelso.</p> <p>Annan enjoyed Cambridge hugely. He was at the centre of social and intellectual life. He always remained a King's man. EM Forster had been given a set of rooms in King's from 1953 (to his death in 1970) and Annan constantly referred to him as \"my guru\". Forster sometimes thought that King's was a bit too ostentatious, and that its buildings had a tendency to say \"look at me.\" Annan's critics would say that it was not surprising that he did not think this. They suggested that Annan was too smart and sophisticated. But if Annan defended that which was exclusive, he was sometimes only being sensible. It was absurd to accuse the Apostles, a club that existed to discuss a variety of subjects, as being the centre for homosexuals or for becoming traitors, as certain hostile critics did.</p> <p>He was very active as a critic. It was during these years that he wrote two influential articles, one on Kipling's Place in the History of Ideas (Victorian Studies 1959-1960) and the other, The Intellectual Aristocracy, on the emergence of that group in England (published in Studies in Social History, a tribute to GM Trevelyan, 1955). Both have been endlessly quoted. It was during these years that he developed his views on sociology, and proposed that it be taught as an undergraduate subject in Cambridge. \"Nothing marks the break with Victorian thought more decisively than modern sociology\" was his dictum. His work Leslie Stephen: His Thought and Character in Relation to His Time (1951) on Stephen as a literary critic raised the question of literature and its relation to society.</p> <p>It was here (as well as over CP Snow's ideas of the two cultures, the scientist and the humanist) that he came into conflict with FR Leavis (and his wife, QD Leavis). This became a classic antagonism, with Leavis denouncing Annan as a key member of the establishment and ridiculing him because he supposedly thought of a university as an industrial plant, for ever humming away in ceaseless training of the hapless young. Annan had little difficulty in pointing to the contradictions and inadequacies of Leavis's arguments and denouncing him as callous and dismissive. He once wrote, \"all public controversy is dispiriting; controversy with Dr Leavis is degrading\".</p> <p>Annan's activity in promoting widespread educational reform was considerable. He hosted more than one important conference on the subject, and it was widely rumoured that when Labour returned to power, as expected in 1964, he would be given a ministerial post. But this was not to be. And when he left Cambridge in 1966 it was to take over the direction of University College, London, \"that university within a university\" as he called it.</p> <p>It was ironical that he should have chosen University College. In Cambridge, Leavis and others had attacked him for being at the centre of the supposed Bloomsbury-King's cult (King's had been described as Bloomsbury-on-Cam) and now Annan was within a few hundred yards of Bloomsbury Square and his new college occupied many houses where the Bloomsbury set used to live in Gordon Square, and where Maynard Keynes's widow was still to be seen walking her dog in the mornings. Outside his office was another of Leavis's hates, Jeremy Bentham, whose clothed skeleton occupies a box. One day Annan emerged from his office, with a number of Japanese visitors, to discover the French Marxist philosopher, Louis Althusser, trying to break into the case to prove that it was not Bentham.</p> <p>He found much at University College to surprise him. He could not understand that the first college to admit women with full status should have a senior common room from which women were excluded. They had their own common room, which was small. And there was a joint senior common room, universally known as the \"joint\". When a vote was held, the women preferred the existing system. The exclusion only ceased when a number of women simply started to use the senior common room as a matter of convenience.</p> <p>He was also surprised by the power of the professors, but accepted with joviality the information that they spent only three to four hours teaching in some weeks of the term. He was sure the students learned a great deal during that time. And the same professors feared Annan's innovatory intentions and were uneasy over new appointments, since he had a wide range of friends and contacts.</p> <p>For a time, expansion continued and new subjects were introduced. The last major building in Annan's time was the School of Architecture and Planning, the Wates building, which was opened in 1975. For the first time Annan encountered student unrest and new developments in the organisation and role of the college's non-academic staff. Annan had made a careful study of the literature of student unrest and had a good understanding of the phenomenon, as he later showed in the report that he wrote on student protests in the University of Essex, which was a model of discernment.</p> <p>At University College his attitude was essentially personal. He would meet student leaders and talk and socialise with them. The saying among staff was \"as long as Noel doesn't run out of glasses, we're all right.\"</p> <p>On one occasion students occupied part of the main building and caused considerable inconvenience. Annan pursued a policy of discussion and waiting. Some members of staff thought that this was too weak, and the professors of history, for example, with one exception, signed a protest demanding strong action. But before the protest had reached the provost, the student action collapsed. He showed some sympathy towards the exhausted and depressed young men and women, and some irritation towards the professors.</p> <p>At University College he enjoyed helping with syllabuses. To give one example, he devised the degree course in Latin American studies and Spanish. But he was the first to say that he was not skilful in raising money. And he thought increasingly that many of University College's problems were part of the general problem of the University of London. He was very careful that his many other activities did not interfere with his duties as provost, whether it was his role in the Lords or whether it was as the author of the committee on the future of broadcasting report, always known as the Annan Report, (published in 1977).</p> <p>But he sensed that these activities were at times resented by members of the college. He was, as was not always realised, a sensitive man. It was this hostility that was one of the reasons why he chose to become the first full-time vice-chancellor of the University of London. There he endeavoured to rationalise the university, by grouping together certain colleges. He found himself dealing even more with civil servants, and it was with feeling that he coined the phrase \"the memo is more deadly than the demo.\"</p> <p>He always looked back to the ideal which he had had when in Cambridge. \"The intellect. That is what universities exist for. Everything else is secondary.\" He realised this ideal was always being questioned. He questioned it himself, but always came back to it in some form.</p> <p>Noel Annan lived life to the full. He played tennis until he was quite elderly. When preparing his report on the future of broadcasting, he would rise very early and go for a swim in Hampstead. He was alert to the intellectual scene, as he showed with the panoramic display of his generation in his remarkable book Our Age (1990). In this he was ably helped by his wife Gabriele, herself a distinguished and incisive writer. All of Annan's many activities, centred as they were on education, literature and philosophical history, were devoted to the one subject: Culture, and \"enclosing the wilderness of an idea within a wall of words\" (Samuel Butler). His last book, The Dons: Mentors, Eccentrics, Geniuses (1999) was full of perceptive academic comment.</p> <p>His wife and two daughters survive him.</p> <p>Noel Gilroy Annan, scholar, born December 25 1916; died February 21 2000</p>",

EM Forster had been given a set of rooms in King's from 1953 (to his death in 1970) and Annan constantly referred to him as \"my guru\". Forster sometimes thought that King's was a bit too ostentatious, and that its buildings had a tendency to say \"look at me.\" Annan's critics would say that it was not surprising that he did not think this. They suggested that Annan was too smart and sophisticated. But if Annan defended that which was exclusive, he was sometimes only being sensible. It was absurd to accuse the Apostles, a club that existed to discuss a variety of subjects, as being the centre for homosexuals or for becoming traitors, as certain hostile critics did. He was very active as a critic. It was during these years that he wrote two influential articles, one on Kipling's Place in the History of Ideas (Victorian Studies 1959-1960) and the other, The Intellectual Aristocracy, on the emergence of that group in England (published in Studies in Social History, a tribute to GM Trevelyan, 1955). Both have been endlessly quoted. It was during these years that he developed his views on sociology, and proposed that it be taught as an undergraduate subject in Cambridge. \"Nothing marks the break with Victorian thought more decisively than modern sociology\" was his dictum. His work Leslie Stephen: His Thought and Character in Relation to His Time (1951) on Stephen as a literary critic raised the question of literature and its relation to society. It was here (as well as over CP Snow's ideas of the two cultures, the scientist and the humanist) that he came into conflict with FR Leavis (and his wife, QD Leavis). This became a classic antagonism, with Leavis denouncing Annan as a key member of the establishment and ridiculing him because he supposedly thought of a university as an industrial plant, for ever humming away in ceaseless training of the hapless young. Annan had little difficulty in pointing to the contradictions and inadequacies of Leavis's arguments and denouncing him as callous and dismissive. He once wrote, \"all public controversy is dispiriting; controversy with Dr Leavis is degrading\". Annan's activity in promoting widespread educational reform was considerable. He hosted more than one important conference on the subject, and it was widely rumoured that when Labour returned to power, as expected in 1964, he would be given a ministerial post. But this was not to be. And when he left Cambridge in 1966 it was to take over the direction of University College, London, \"that university within a university\" as he called it. It was ironical that he should have chosen University College. In Cambridge, Leavis and others had attacked him for being at the centre of the supposed Bloomsbury-King's cult (King's had been described as Bloomsbury-on-Cam) and now Annan was within a few hundred yards of Bloomsbury Square and his new college occupied many houses where the Bloomsbury set used to live in Gordon Square, and where Maynard Keynes's widow was still to be seen walking her dog in the mornings. Outside his office was another of Leavis's hates, Jeremy Bentham, whose clothed skeleton occupies a box. One day Annan emerged from his office, with a number of Japanese visitors, to discover the French Marxist philosopher, Louis Althusser, trying to break into the case to prove that it was not Bentham. He found much at University College to surprise him. He could not understand that the first college to admit women with full status should have a senior common room from which women were excluded. They had their own common room, which was small. And there was a joint senior common room, universally known as the \"joint\". When a vote was held, the women preferred the existing system. The exclusion only ceased when a number of women simply started to use the senior common room as a matter of convenience. He was also surprised by the power of the professors, but accepted with joviality the information that they spent only three to four hours teaching in some weeks of the term. He was sure the students learned a great deal during that time. And the same professors feared Annan's innovatory intentions and were uneasy over new appointments, since he had a wide range of friends and contacts. For a time, expansion continued and new subjects were introduced. The last major building in Annan's time was the School of Architecture and Planning, the Wates building, which was opened in 1975. For the first time Annan encountered student unrest and new developments in the organisation and role of the college's non-academic staff. Annan had made a careful study of the literature of student unrest and had a good understanding of the phenomenon, as he later showed in the report that he wrote on student protests in the University of Essex, which was a model of discernment. At University College his attitude was essentially personal. He would meet student leaders and talk and socialise with them. The saying among staff was \"as long as Noel doesn't run out of glasses, we're all right.\" On one occasion students occupied part of the main building and caused considerable inconvenience. Annan pursued a policy of discussion and waiting. Some members of staff thought that this was too weak, and the professors of history, for example, with one exception, signed a protest demanding strong action. But before the protest had reached the provost, the student action collapsed. He showed some sympathy towards the exhausted and depressed young men and women, and some irritation towards the professors. At University College he enjoyed helping with syllabuses. To give one example, he devised the degree course in Latin American studies and Spanish. But he was the first to say that he was not skilful in raising money. And he thought increasingly that many of University College's problems were part of the general problem of the University of London. He was very careful that his many other activities did not interfere with his duties as provost, whether it was his role in the Lords or whether it was as the author of the committee on the future of broadcasting report, always known as the Annan Report, (published in 1977). But he sensed that these activities were at times resented by members of the college. He was, as was not always realised, a sensitive man. It was this hostility that was one of the reasons why he chose to become the first full-time vice-chancellor of the University of London. There he endeavoured to rationalise the university, by grouping together certain colleges. He found himself dealing even more with civil servants, and it was with feeling that he coined the phrase \"the memo is more deadly than the demo.\" He always looked back to the ideal which he had had when in Cambridge. \"The intellect. That is what universities exist for. Everything else is secondary.\" He realised this ideal was always being questioned. He questioned it himself, but always came back to it in some form. Noel Annan lived life to the full. He played tennis until he was quite elderly. When preparing his report on the future of broadcasting, he would rise very early and go for a swim in Hampstead. He was alert to the intellectual scene, as he showed with the panoramic display of his generation in his remarkable book Our Age (1990). In this he was ably helped by his wife Gabriele, herself a distinguished and incisive writer. All of Annan's many activities, centred as they were on education, literature and philosophical history, were devoted to the one subject: Culture, and \"enclosing the wilderness of an idea within a wall of words\" (Samuel Butler). His last book, The Dons: Mentors, Eccentrics, Geniuses (1999) was full of perceptive academic comment. His wife and two daughters survive him. Noel Gilroy Annan, scholar, born December 25 1916; died February 21 2000",

      "bodyText": "Japan's nuclear power industry suffered a historic defeat yesterday when one of the country's biggest utilities was forced to scrap plans for a power plant that it has been trying to build for 37 years. The stunning setback - less than six months after the country's worst nuclear accident - underlines the growing hostility to atomic energy in Japan and raises questions about the government's ambitious atomic energy programme. The plan to construct two 1,300 megawatt reactors in Ashihama, a scenic coastal area in Mie prefecture, central Japan, has been the subject of a prolonged and bitter confrontation since 1963, when it was first proposed by Chubu Electric Power Company. The prefecture's governor, Masayasu Kitagawa, broke the stalemate yesterday by becoming the first politician of his rank to order the abandonment of a nuclear project. \"The plan has neither the support nor the cooperation of local residents,\" he told an assembly of local politicians. \"It should go back to the drawing board.\" Within hours, Chubu Electric announced that it would start looking for an alternative site. The decision has sent shock waves through Japan's nuclear industry, as prefectural governors have tended to side with the powerful utilities which bring jobs and tax revenue, rather than residents. Public opinion has grown more hostile, however, as a result of a series of high-profile accidents and cover-ups in recent years. In a sign of the changing climate, anti-nuclear campaigners have been elected mayors in some towns and four years ago, the community of Maki in northern Japan rejected plans for a nuclear plant in a referendum. Mr Kitagawa said his decision was prompted by the growing concerns about nuclear safety in the wake of the uncontrolled nuclear fission at a uranium processing plant in Tokaimura last September. One man died and more than 400 people were exposed to radiation following the accident, which occurred when plant workers mixed seven times the safe amount of uranium in a bucket. It has since emerged that they were following an illegal manual and that the plant was rarely inspected by the authorities. \"People's worries and disbelief in nuclear power reached a previously unknown intensity after the Tokaimura accident,\" Mr Kitagawa said. The reputation of the industry has also been damaged by revelations that workers at British Nuclear Fuels fabricated safety data on shipments of recycled fuel sent to Japan. The Mie governor's move comes at a sensitive time for the government, which is in the midst of a five-yearly re view of Japan's nuclear policy. A country with almost no natural energy resources, Japan relies on atomic power to supply 30% of its electricity and it wants to increase this amount by building 20 new plants by 2010. Even before yesterday's decision - which means at the very least a delay for one of those facilities - bureaucrats were debating whether to lower the target because of the increasing hostility to nuclear power. Parliament is also expected to begin a debate early next month on where to site a new storage site for high-level radioactive waste. In the current climate, few prefectures are likely to be willing to accept such a facility. Anti-nuclear campaigners welcomed yesterday's decision. \"After a 37-year fight by the people of this area, we have finally won a victory,\" said Yoichi Shibahara, a resident near Ashihama. \"After this decision, it will be impossible for nuclear plants to be built against the wishes of local people anywhere in Japan.\"",

The Thai government filed a complaint with police yesterday against Kamol Sukosol, a distributor of x-ray equipment, alleging that it mishandled radioactive materials and exposed at least nine people to dangerous levels of radiation. They believe the cylinder containing the radioactive isotope was removed from one of three x-ray machines dumped in a parking lot. Five workers at the scrapyard who opened the cylinder were in hospital over the weekend with radiation sickness. Four waste collectors who removed the cylinder also came down with radiation sickness and were placed in intensive care on Monday. The victims suffered sharp drops in their white blood cell counts, blisters, skin burns and hair loss. \"The company failed to handle the radioactive waste, and put people's lives at risk,\" said Ong-art Klampaiboon, an adviser to the country's science ministry.",

Four different divorce cases that the centre has raised for Itimad over the past three years have failed, merely because the court clerk assigned to deliver the divorce summons cannot find Itimad's husband. He may have been bribed by the husband, Ms Ali claimed. Women's rights activists in Egypt have campaigned for years to wrest divorce from the male preserve it has been for so long. According to the 1929 personal status law, a woman can only file for divorce in cases of physical or psychological abuse, which must be proved by the woman. But a man could simply say \"I divorce you\" three times, or get a divorce by filing a paper with the marriage registrar, in which case he would not even need to inform his wife. Supporters of that legislation claimed it was inspired by Islamic law. But women's activists noted that it also conveniently ignored rights afforded by Islam to women. The activists lobbied to guarantee more rights for women by writing them into marriage contracts, but opposition from the religious establishment torpedoed their efforts. Last month, under pressure from the government, the Egyptian parliament approved amendments to the personal status law which, for the first time in Egypt's history, allow women to file for divorce on grounds of incompatibility. After all manner of social disintegration was predicted by members of the male-dominated parliament, MPs approved the changes. Under the new law, based on an Islamic precept called khula, women who want to divorce their husbands must return their dowries and relinquish all financial claims, including alimony. The doom-laden predictions of male politicians that the law would encourage women to leave their husbands en masse - along with cartoons in national newspapers that showed men in chains and moustachioed wives with downtrodden men at their side pushing baby buggies - reflected the deep-seated fear of women's rights in this deeply conservative country. Opposition to the amendment also came from Afghanistan's ultra-conservative ruling Taliban movement. A Taliban spokesman said the changes were \"a blatant violation of Islam\". He said: \"The Islamic world should protest against this move.\" But liberals have argued that the new changes do not go far enough, saying it would be difficult for poor women to return their dowries and to renounce financial rights. Zeinab Radwan, a dean at Cairo university's college of Arabic and Islamic studies, says it is not Islam that denies women rights, but the male monopoly of its interpretation. \"It is not a law that will destroy the family, but men's behaviour,\" she said. \"Men in this country are not used to the idea that women have rights.

Work announced yesterday will reopen swaths of the site to the public and allow digging in an unexplored 20 hectares, where bodies and buildings are believed to be smothered in pumice, undisturbed since Vesuvius erupted in AD79. The findings may resolve the dispute over whether those who died were asphyxiated slowly by ash or poisoned instantly by a cloud of toxic gas. Analysis of thermal shocks to 300 bodies found at the nearby village of Herculaneum suggested they were killed within seconds by a gas at a temperature of 400C. Other theories suggest that most of the 2,000 victims were killed by inhaling the ash and pumice which piled 20ft high. A column of smoke reached 25 miles into the sky.

The Albanians - part of a 60,000-strong protest march from Kosovo's provincial capital, Pristina, - had been demanding an end to Mitrovice's division into Serb and Albanian areas. </p> <p>The division has sparked violence that has left nine people dead and more than 20 wounded this month, including two French soldiers shot in gun battles. </p> <p>Leaders of the city's Serb minority community north of the bridge, which divides them from ethnic Albanians, claimed that hundreds of armed troublemakers broke through K-For lines on Monday to reach the bridge.

      "bodyText": "Nato halts searches in Mitrovice Peacekeepers in Mitrovice yesterday suspended most weapons searches to defuse tension a day after their troops struggled to prevent riots in the divided Kosovan town. The Nato-led peace force, K-For, announced a suspension of house-to-house weapons searches in both the Albanian and Serbian sectors of the city, but said soldiers were still searching cars and individuals. The house-to-house checks had enraged Serbs, many of whom were thought to keep weapons in case of an attack by ethnic Albanians. About 1,000 Albanian miners yesterday demonstrated silently near the site where peacekeepers had fired tear gas on Monday and fought with their bare hands to prevent Kosovo Albanians from storming a bridge. The Albanians - part of a 60,000-strong protest march from Kosovo's provincial capital, Pristina, - had been demanding an end to Mitrovice's division into Serb and Albanian areas. The division has sparked violence that has left nine people dead and more than 20 wounded this month, including two French soldiers shot in gun battles. Leaders of the city's Serb minority community north of the bridge, which divides them from ethnic Albanians, claimed that hundreds of armed troublemakers broke through K-For lines on Monday to reach the bridge. Their claims were denied by K-For. \"I think that troops did a good job yesterday in what could have been an explosive situation,\" said Captain Joe Butterfill, a spokesman for British forces.

Because Yevgeny Dzhugashvili was a citizen of Russia, not Georgia, he could not be a candidate in the April 9 election, according to commission spokeswoman Eka Peradze. The incumbent president, Eduard Shevardnadze, is the frontrunner in the race. Mr Dzhugashvili, a leftwinger who has called for the restoration of the Soviet Union, was barred from running in Georgia's parliamentary elections last autumn because he is not a citizen.

Amid growing worldwide concern about higher crude oil prices caused by lower production in the Opec oil-producing nations, more than 300 trucks assembled at dawn in New Jersey and arrived in Washington, 200 miles to the south, in a three-mile-long convoy, hooting their horns and paralysing traffic. After parking their rigs in dozens of streets around the congress building, the Capitol, the truckers climbed the steps to demand that congress and the White House approve a 15c (10p)-a-gallon rebate scheme for commercial truckers while prices remain high, and that they cut federal excise tax on diesel. But few congressmen were in Washington to meet the protesters yesterday since only the senate is in session this week.

Crude oil is selling for around $30 (\u00a318.75) a barrel, its highest price since the gulf war in 1991 and nearly three times the price of a barrel of crude in December 1998. The truckers say many haulage firms may soon go out of business, creating shortages of goods and higher inflation.

      "body": "<p>In the past 24 years my husband and I have adopted three children and fostered many others. We are part of a mostly silent majority of adopters who have gradually become more vocal in an attempt to stem the number of adoptions taking place. Yes, that's right: we want fewer children to be adopted. We want the bandwagon halted in its tracks until social services get their act together and stop destroying well-meaning families. </p> <p>Mass adoption in this country took off from a US initiative in the late 50s that rolled over here within a decade. You may remember the accompanying slogan: \"Every child has a right to a family.\" No in-depth research, no thought, just an evangelical crusade that brooked no doubts. Indeed, anyone advising caution was likely to be stoned to death as a heretic; I bear the scars to this day. But Armageddon has come to pass, and the care system in the US is today in crisis, with the UK's crisis perhaps five years behind. </p> <p>The whole foundation of child adoption, as opposed to baby adoption, was that tender loving care by ordinary, warm-hearted individuals would produce happy, healthy children. Appeals were made to the emotions on television and in the newspapers, with little comments such as \"may be attention-seeking\" or \"needs a lot of reassurance\" - phrases that old hands would recognise as covering a multitude of difficulties, but which meant little or nothing to the unsuspecting viewers at whom they were aimed. On television these appeals, together with footage showing appealing, needy children that touched the heart and the conscience, as they were designed to do, were fronted by celebrities who are still on my personal hit list; to this day I can't look at a Jane Asher cake without wanting to throw it at her. Social services, we were told, weren't looking for some impossible ideal, but for the average family, for people with a lot of love to give, and we all like to think we have that. </p> <p>The trouble was, and still is, that it is all a lie, because the majority of children in care are so damaged that ordinary, warm-hearted individuals have no hope of coping with them. </p> <p>However much it goes against the zeal, not every child is adoptable. The breakdown rate in adoption began to soar, though to this day most social services will come over all coy and vague when asked to put a figure on it, and they never tell prospective adopters that breakdowns happen. But, for the record, a major study some years ago in Strathclyde region found that breakdowns escalated from around 16% if the child was adopted aged five, to 60% if the child was adopted at nine or older. There is no reason to suspect that other areas of Britain do any better. </p> <p>In that study, three years was counted as a success but, as battle-scarred old sorts like me know, adoptions can break down after longer than that. There are lots of reasons, lots of problems, from constant lying, stealing and other forms of anti-social behaviour, to the most common: the inability of the child to form emotional attachment. Children in distress either sink or swim, and the swimmers often do so by looking out for number one. Families give affection and it is taken, often with demands for even more, but it can be debilitating and draining when little comes back, and even when it does, there may be strings attached. The children become users of others, portraying an affection they don't feel to get whatever they want. It's a common scenario and even understanding it doesn't necessarily make it any easier to cope with year after year. </p> <p>My family's experiences are not unique; we have not been especially unlucky. There are a lot of us out there. Anyone who is told \"it's just like having your own\" should sue. Our son, Euan, was a baby adoption. We then fostered two girls, Louise and Marion, aged 30 months and 18 months respectively, adopting them five years later. Louise, was, according to the case social worker, \"showing early signs of disturbance... she clings to people\". How we laugh when we think back, however wryly. Believing that we were reclaiming a child with the potential to become a functioning human being, we sank most of our energies into Louise over the years, taking time and emotion from ourselves and our other two children. But gradually, as we unwound Louise's problems, we discovered more than we had been told. An officer from the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children told us that Louise had been battered at 10 months by one of mummy's boyfriends because she wouldn't call him daddy, and after that she was noticed head-banging. Recognising this as a sign of brain damage, a health visitor informed social services who made an appointment for the mother to take Louise to hospital for a check-up. When she failed to turn up for three appointments they shrugged their caring shoulders and did nothing more. Neither did they tell us, her now adoptive parents, only confirming it when we found out. And that became the pattern; as we discovered some new horror they would confirm it, but nothing more was disclosed. </p> <p>Life with Louise became more hellish as she grew and we kept in touch with social services, so they knew that our family life was under great stress. We were no longer looking for progress, we were trying to contain her increasingly bizarre behaviour. Our son, Euan, walked out of the house one day and didn't come back for the longest 36 hours of our lives, worn down and depressed by the strain of life with Louise. He was doing his Highers [the Scottish equivalent of A-levels] at the time. He failed them and left school. It took him three years to enrol at college to resit Highers and A levels, which meant that he started university later than he should have. </p> <p>In the meantime, Louise had been diagnosed as psychotic at 16, and we realised that what we had been living with was the characteristic long, slow decline of schizophrenia-type illnesses. When I told the placing social worker he replied: \"Well, that's hardly surprising, given her family history.\" He then unfolded the rest of her family history, which was riddled with mental illness. He hadn't disclosed it before, he said, \"because no psychiatrist would give us official diagnoses on the other family members, due to patient confidentiality\". Didn't it occur to him to tell us that there were grounds to ask for these diagnoses? And when did he find out, \"officially\"? </p> <p>We have now found out the full extent of Louise's problems: brain damage consistent with violent shaking of a child under the age of one, a form of moderate to severe autism that can follow such injuries, and, of course, a psychosis that is only partially controlled by powerful drugs with their attendant side-effects. In the circumstances, confirmation of early sexual abuse somehow paled into insignificance. The prognosis is that she will never work, marry, have children or even be allowed out without an escort, and for the rest of her life she will need 24-hour care. </p> <p>It was our belief that social services owed our other two children compensation for their ruined childhoods, and that they should make some kind of settlement to ensure Louise's future care; compensating my husband and me would be impossible. Their response has been to say that they think they're legally covered, that we should have sued within three years of finding out what they knew, three years when we were desperately trying to cope with a mentally ill child. And besides, they say, total disclosure wasn't policy when we adopted the girls in 1985 - not true, but it wastes more time on pointless correspondence. I know of adoptive parents in similar circumstances who have wasted four-figure sums involving lawyers in just this kind of stalling, the local authority happy in the knowledge that as a result they will have that much less to finance a court case. Legally covered, you see; morality doesn't come into it. </p> <p>It doesn't stop there. Some years ago, as special foster parents, we took two boys, George, nine and Sandy, 12, both with varying degrees of foetal alcohol syndrome, which affected them both mentally and physically. It was our job to find out if they were adoptable and, if they were, to get them into an adoptable state. We quickly discovered that social services' greatest worry, that George had \"problems of gender identification\", was wide of the mark; he was anatomically male, but in his mind he was female. His femininity gave him access to the company of girls, but it soon became clear that he had much deeper psychological problems when we witnessed a variety of unprovoked attacks on girls, verbal, physical and sexual. </p> <p>It was when he attacked Marion that we discovered what everyone else already knew: that this tendency was well-documented. They had placed an abusing boy in a family with two girls. Given George's problems and with puberty looming, we gave our opinion that he was not adoptable and that more attention should be focused on Sandy, who might be. We were so concerned that Sandy was being sacrificed to support his brother that we offered to adopt him. And that's when social services descended, removing both boys. You can't adopt if you don't have custody of the child. One social worker justified removing both boys with the remark: \"After all, blood's thicker than water.\" Despite protestations that the boys would be placed with a family within months, both remained in care till their late teens, and Sandy never did find out that he could have been adopted. In fact, he died not knowing. It was just a small paragraph in a newspaper - murders are not uncommon in big cities these days. Sandy, aged 21, was attacked and stabbed with a sword. When he was released from care where could he go but back to the deprived, rundown, violent inner-city area he came from? There was nowhere else. Blood is indeed thicker than water, as those who had to hose Sandy's blood off the street doubtless noticed. </p> <p> As old hands at adoption know, what matters most is not how young the children are, but what has happened to them in their lives, and the family history. You only have to think of how much a child learns in its first year to have some idea of the harm that can be done in that time. Social workers often say that the level of damage is not apparent for years, which is true, and so they go on placing ticking time bombs within unsuspecting families. Being childless and wanting a family or feeling sorry for these children are bad reasons for adopting. The only people who should take them on are those with an almost professional ability and knowledge; kindly, golden-hearted, warm, loving, ordinary people risk destroying themselves and their families. </p> <p>Some placements do work out well, we know about those because they are always the ones trotted out as \"examples\". But there is no way of knowing if you are being told the full truth, or of predicting which placements will succeed, and finding out has destroyed many marriages and families. In recent years, as adopters have become more vocal about the fall-out of that misguided bandwagon from the US, and a new generation of social workers has replaced the mindless crusaders, adoption has slowed down. Not a bad thing, when you remember the extra damage done to children whose adoptions have failed, as well as the families they have scarred. </p> <p>The sad fact, one that has been scorned out of ignorance and dogma, is that there are many children who are so damaged that they can only handle institutional care. But that doesn't mean the workhouse or years of abuse - it means that we have to look at providing different kinds of institutional care to suit the children who cannot cope with life within a family and cannot be coped with. The last thing we need now is another New Labour crusade of show without substance, a simplistic vote-enhancer for Tony, saviour of little children. Generations of children have suffered enough damage, as have families conned by nonsense about \"tender loving care\". Soundbite solutions are not the answer.</p>",

This was the argument used by Ken when the result was announced on Sunday and his justification for describing the result as \"tainted\". It is also the argument used by Paul Foot in yesterday's Guardian and has become common currency in the debate over the mayor. Indeed the very fact an electoral college was used has become code for saying the selection was unfairly conducted.</p> <p>First of all, the electoral college is not new. It has been in use in the Labour party for many years. It was not just used in Scotland and Wales. It was also used to elect Neil Kinnock, Roy Hattersley and John Smith, as well as Tony Blair and John Prescott of course. Going back even further, the electoral college was used in the 1981 titanic battle for the deputy leadership between Tony Benn and Denis Healey. Unlike Frank, Denis Healey really did win by a whisker. But Tony Benn, to his credit, never even hinted that he would consider walking away, leaving the party and running as an independent.</p> <p>When the electoral college was introduced it was defended by Ken and his allies as reflecting the federal nature of the party - unions, party members and elected representatives. And indeed that is one of its strengths. But, goes the next argument, the electoral college was misused in London. Ken's supporters will say that in earlier instances all unions who took part balloted their members.</p> <p>It is true that not all unions balloted their members in London. But it is not true that this delivered the result for Frank Dobson. Where union ballots took place, in most cases the unions did not split their votes in the way the Labour members section was divided. Thus in ballot after ballot which Ken won, he was able to ratchet up 100% of each union's vote while Frank and Glenda received 0%.</p> <p>A telling fact about the so-called stitch-up is that if every union had split their vote in the way that the GMB, for example, did, Frank Dobson's margin of victory would have been even higher. This remains true even if those organisations which did not ballot had done so and Ken won these ballots by a margin of four to one.</p> <p>The second objection to the electoral college is that the MPs, MEPs and candidates section swung it for Frank. But does anyone really argue that the candidates who are to campaign alongside the mayor should not have a big say in who the candidate is? One reason that Tony Blair did not argue for straight one member one vote in the past for leadership contests is that he believes, as do the vast majority of MPs, that you cannot have a party leader who does not have the confidence of the PLP. The same applies in London.</p> <p>It is a complete myth to say that the electoral college is either an illegitimate method of selection or that its operation delivered the selection unfairly for Frank Dobson. His margin of victory was reduced by the inclusion of MPs and MEPs and by union after union allocating 100% of their vote to Ken as long as he won more than 50% in their ballots.</p> <p>So let us move on from the misplaced accusations of a stitch-up and focus on the real issue this week - will Ken run as an independent or not? To complain about a result is one thing, but to walk away and run against the party is to place yourself outside the party for ever.</p> <p>It is a step I would never contemplate, nor would the vast majority of Labour's members, be they on the right or the left. The question of Ken running as an independent has been raised time and time again over the past few months and he ruled it out absolutely. He also assured the selection board: \"I am happy to confirm, as I have done on so many occasions that, if Frank Dobson wins the vote in the electoral college - however narrowly - I will support his campaign for mayor.\"</p> <p>It is time for the speculation to stop. Labour deserves better than the events of the past few days. We have a candidate now and Frank Dobson deserves better than to be undermined in this way. It is time the nonsense stopped and all of us, including Ken, backed Frank for mayor - as he promised.</p> <p>\u0095 Ian McCartney is cabinet office minister</p>",

Thus in ballot after ballot which Ken won, he was able to ratchet up 100% of each union's vote while Frank and Glenda received 0%. A telling fact about the so-called stitch-up is that if every union had split their vote in the way that the GMB, for example, did, Frank Dobson's margin of victory would have been even higher. This remains true even if those organisations which did not ballot had done so and Ken won these ballots by a margin of four to one. The second objection to the electoral college is that the MPs, MEPs and candidates section swung it for Frank. But does anyone really argue that the candidates who are to campaign alongside the mayor should not have a big say in who the candidate is? One reason that Tony Blair did not argue for straight one member one vote in the past for leadership contests is that he believes, as do the vast majority of MPs, that you cannot have a party leader who does not have the confidence of the PLP. The same applies in London. It is a complete myth to say that the electoral college is either an illegitimate method of selection or that its operation delivered the selection unfairly for Frank Dobson. His margin of victory was reduced by the inclusion of MPs and MEPs and by union after union allocating 100% of their vote to Ken as long as he won more than 50% in their ballots. So let us move on from the misplaced accusations of a stitch-up and focus on the real issue this week - will Ken run as an independent or not? To complain about a result is one thing, but to walk away and run against the party is to place yourself outside the party for ever. It is a step I would never contemplate, nor would the vast majority of Labour's members, be they on the right or the left. The question of Ken running as an independent has been raised time and time again over the past few months and he ruled it out absolutely. He also assured the selection board: \"I am happy to confirm, as I have done on so many occasions that, if Frank Dobson wins the vote in the electoral college - however narrowly - I will support his campaign for mayor.\" It is time for the speculation to stop. Labour deserves better than the events of the past few days. We have a candidate now and Frank Dobson deserves better than to be undermined in this way. It is time the nonsense stopped and all of us, including Ken, backed Frank for mayor - as he promised. \u0095 Ian McCartney is cabinet office minister",

      "bodyText": "Barclays Global Investors is expected to announce tomorrow the creation of a new type of stock market investment known as iShare. The move by the fund management arm of Barclays is expected to encourage investors to put their money in \"index-tracking\" strategies followed by the iShares, which will be listed on the London stock exchange. The iShares will be similar to products that BGI is already selling to investors in Canada. Officially known as \"exchange-traded funds\", the launch of the products in Canada late last year has already prompted BGI to plan to unveil 51 similar investments in the United States later this year. The arrival of iShares in Britain is expected to mark a new way of investing in the stock market for both private and professional investors. The products are different to existing unit trusts and investment funds in the way they are traded and the expected lower fees paid to the investment manager, in this case BGI. But, they are also different to these more familiar products in that they allow investors to adopt more sophisticated trading strategies because iShares can be bought \"on margin\", allowing investors to borrow money to pay for them. BGI, which refused to comment yesterday, is expected to announce plans to unveil a whole range of products based on traditional indices as well as internet stocks. By buying the iShares, investors will have almost instantaneous access to which ever stock market index is tracking rather than the delay they now experience by buying traditional unit trusts or investment trusts. The iShares - known in Canada as iUnits - might prompt fears of greater distortion in the stock market where index-tracking funds are said to be behind the rise in demand for big stocks in the major indices. Index tracking involves buying shares to replicate an in dex as opposed to \"active\" fund managers which make decisions about which stocks to buy and sell on their merits. The success of these exchanged-traded funds in Canada was highlighted by Matt Barrett, Barclays new Irish-Canadian chief executive last week at the bank's 1999 profits presentation as a reason for the business achieved by BGI. BGI, based in San Francisco, is already one of the world's biggest fund management groups, more than $680bn (\u00a3421.4bn) of assets for investors, most of which is in so-called index-tracking products. While the group has apparently had some success with the exchange-traded funds in the North American market, where investors are more prevalent, Barclays has had a checkered history at launching new products in Britain.

According to George Wimpey, the housebuilder, you will be able to do so soon. Later this year on two sites in Essex, Wimpey will put up factory-made homes for Guinness Trust, a housing association, which will come with fitted carpets and can be assembled in a couple of days. Dennis Brant, Wimpey's chief executive, sees the revo lutionary concept being rolled out into the private sector where an increasingly wealthy population is demanding detached homes designed and built to their own specification. The houses, complete with steel frame to allow maximum loft space, will be assembled in four or five modules which will be delivered to sites where the foundations and pipes and wires have already been laid. They take 4 to 6 weeks to build in the factory compared with 13 weeks for a traditional house. Unveiling a 33% rise in 1999 pre-tax profits to \u00a3112.8m, Mr Brant said the new concept homes could help encourage more young people into the construction industry and promote the \"de-skilling and multi-skilling\" under way. A government task force led by Sir John Egan demanded 18 months ago that the industry clean up its act, condemning shoddy profits, filthy sites and downtrodden employees. By moving the building of homes to modern, air-conditioned factories, Mr Brant said, more young people would be attracted to the industry - and discover that the old craft skills were no longer needed while flexibility reigned supreme. Mr Brant also disclosed that a growing number of home-buyers are moving online, with Wimpey reporting 750 sales leads a month and a 300% increase in visits to its website in the past year. The group - which wrote off \u00a34m last September because of accounting irregularities and has seen its shares slide in recent years - said it was on course to beat its targets ahead of schedule.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The woman centre stage looks pissed off. She's trying to play this Debussy thing on the flute but she can't get it right. Then, backstage, a trumpet begins to play, not just the Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s midi d'un faune, but a sensual, cool jazz variation on its theme. The sort of playing that can turn a girl's head. \"Shit,\" says the flautist. She'll never be as good a musician as the side man who is even now coming centre stage, bent on wooing her. </p> <p>Terry, this wannabe jazzer's moll, is a lovely paradox: a foul-mouthed ing\u00e9nue with a Noo Yawk twang and a trucker's diction, who doesn't understand the heroin addiction prevalent among certain jazz musicians. She's tough but winningly vulnerable. </p> <p>This is the first time we see Edie Falco in Side Man, the West End transfer of an award-winning Broadway show. Warren Leight's autobiographical play is about the trials and tribulations of male jazzers in New York, from their 50s heyday to their 80s nadir, and the women who loved them. It's dramatised from the perspective of Terry's son, here played by former TV sexpot, Jason Priestley. </p> <p>Falco, who played Terry in the original off-Broadway production, knew this milieu and empathised with Leight's biography. \"My father used to be in a band. Frankie Falco and his Orchestra. They used to play the Catskills. He had hundreds of obscure jazz records. My mother, too, was a creative person, an actress. So I understand the tension of an artistic household. </p> <p>\"I read the play and I thought 'I know this world'. What could be more beautiful than to play a different angle on that world and suss out a character's motivation? It's an incredible therapy.\" Perhaps by working on this play she could, just as the playwright Leight did, understand her parents and what they endured. </p> <p>During Side Man we watch Terry over four decades of a difficult marriage to a man who is passionate about his art and, less frequently, about her. She's a woman forever on the fuzzy end of the lollipop, often disappointed, bitterly inhaling a cigarette with angrily crossed arms, and exhaling out razor-sharp put downs. </p> <p>Falco seems to have specialised in pissed-off women who are slightly but significantly older than herself (she's 46). In The Sopranos, for instance, she plays Carmela, the wife of screwed-up mobster Tony. \"I don't have a kid myself, but for me to imagine having a 17-year-old daughter in real life - that's too much!\" She won the best actress award at last year's Emmys and a Golden Globe for the best performance by an actress in a dramatic television series for the part. </p> <p>In the first series of this mafia comedy-drama, she had a thing going with the local priest. While Tony was out unburdening himself to his sexy shrink, Carmela was at home watching a DVD of the Remains of the Day with Father Phil, hoping that he might stop being a servant of the Lord for one evening at least. </p> <p>But, at the end of the series, she turned on this clergyman who appeared to want to seduce her and eat all her Italian-American delicacies, delivering one of the best put-downs in recent TV. \"I really appreciate everything you've done for me,\" she tells the priest, \"the religious counselling, the book on Buddhism. But I think you need to look at yourself, because you have this MO where you manipulate spiritually thirsty women and I think a lot of that is tied up with food somehow as well as the sexual tension game.\" Father Phil, devastated by this acute character analysis, shrinks from the Sopranos' house. </p> <p>In Oz, like The Sopranos a Home Box Office-produced drama that has found a niche in British TV viewers' hearts, she plays a double-shifting single mother prison guard, a role which Falco understood from her \"resting\" periods. It was, she recognised, \"another service-type job in a polyester uniform\", just like the waitressing jobs that used to tide her over when off-Broadway shows and indie films didn't pay the rent. This wasn't a career path she hankered to pursue: \"You would bring a fajita to someone and they would go: 'I saw you in so and so.' Horrifying.\" </p> <p>Falco puts down her coffee and takes a drag on her Malboro Light. She's started smoking again after three years, partly because it's easier to smoke in public in London than in New York. Which, for me, is nice, because now she looks something like the stereotype I've created in my head, all smoke-cloud sexuality and caffeinated brittleness. Annoyingly, though, she isn't a disappointed woman in real life. She doesn't even have Carmela's long nails or her penchant for liberally applied make up or pastels. She's swathed in cream to rhyme with her blonde hair, that problematic signifier of her Italian-Swedish heritage that has deprived her, she says, of Italian-American roles that have in the past gone to dark-haired actresses like Annabella Sciorra and Marisa Tomei. </p> <p>Why is a woman with a finally burgeoning acting career working in London? After all, she's pining for her dog Marley, not to mention her boyfriend, actor-director John Devlin. Why come to Shaftesbury Avenue when she's the talk of US TV-land? A lot of people tried to talk her out of working in London: \"My agent was like, 'if you have to'. It didn't make sense in career terms. But I have been so successful in following my heart. I have made a lot of terrible career decisions. But this is what I want to do as an actor: there are stories I want to help tell, experiences I want to have. </p> <p>\"I wasn't sure that the play would work here: the jokes are so specific to New York. But the previews I've done indicate to me that they get the references. What's surprised me is that the audiences are even more ebullient than the best New York crowds. I thought they would be reserved! </p> <p>\"As a kid in Long Island, I was like, 'don't even bother dreaming of going to London'.

      "bodyText": "The woman centre stage looks pissed off. She's trying to play this Debussy thing on the flute but she can't get it right. Then, backstage, a trumpet begins to play, not just the Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s midi d'un faune, but a sensual, cool jazz variation on its theme. The sort of playing that can turn a girl's head. \"Shit,\" says the flautist. She'll never be as good a musician as the side man who is even now coming centre stage, bent on wooing her. Terry, this wannabe jazzer's moll, is a lovely paradox: a foul-mouthed ing\u00e9nue with a Noo Yawk twang and a trucker's diction, who doesn't understand the heroin addiction prevalent among certain jazz musicians. She's tough but winningly vulnerable. This is the first time we see Edie Falco in Side Man, the West End transfer of an award-winning Broadway show. Warren Leight's autobiographical play is about the trials and tribulations of male jazzers in New York, from their 50s heyday to their 80s nadir, and the women who loved them. It's dramatised from the perspective of Terry's son, here played by former TV sexpot, Jason Priestley. Falco, who played Terry in the original off-Broadway production, knew this milieu and empathised with Leight's biography. \"My father used to be in a band. Frankie Falco and his Orchestra. They used to play the Catskills. He had hundreds of obscure jazz records. My mother, too, was a creative person, an actress. So I understand the tension of an artistic household. \"I read the play and I thought 'I know this world'. What could be more beautiful than to play a different angle on that world and suss out a character's motivation? It's an incredible therapy.\" Perhaps by working on this play she could, just as the playwright Leight did, understand her parents and what they endured. During Side Man we watch Terry over four decades of a difficult marriage to a man who is passionate about his art and, less frequently, about her. She's a woman forever on the fuzzy end of the lollipop, often disappointed, bitterly inhaling a cigarette with angrily crossed arms, and exhaling out razor-sharp put downs. Falco seems to have specialised in pissed-off women who are slightly but significantly older than herself (she's 46). In The Sopranos, for instance, she plays Carmela, the wife of screwed-up mobster Tony. \"I don't have a kid myself, but for me to imagine having a 17-year-old daughter in real life - that's too much!\" She won the best actress award at last year's Emmys and a Golden Globe for the best performance by an actress in a dramatic television series for the part. In the first series of this mafia comedy-drama, she had a thing going with the local priest. While Tony was out unburdening himself to his sexy shrink, Carmela was at home watching a DVD of the Remains of the Day with Father Phil, hoping that he might stop being a servant of the Lord for one evening at least. But, at the end of the series, she turned on this clergyman who appeared to want to seduce her and eat all her Italian-American delicacies, delivering one of the best put-downs in recent TV. \"I really appreciate everything you've done for me,\" she tells the priest, \"the religious counselling, the book on Buddhism. But I think you need to look at yourself, because you have this MO where you manipulate spiritually thirsty women and I think a lot of that is tied up with food somehow as well as the sexual tension game.\" Father Phil, devastated by this acute character analysis, shrinks from the Sopranos' house. In Oz, like The Sopranos a Home Box Office-produced drama that has found a niche in British TV viewers' hearts, she plays a double-shifting single mother prison guard, a role which Falco understood from her \"resting\" periods. It was, she recognised, \"another service-type job in a polyester uniform\", just like the waitressing jobs that used to tide her over when off-Broadway shows and indie films didn't pay the rent. This wasn't a career path she hankered to pursue: \"You would bring a fajita to someone and they would go: 'I saw you in so and so.' Horrifying.\" Falco puts down her coffee and takes a drag on her Malboro Light. She's started smoking again after three years, partly because it's easier to smoke in public in London than in New York. Which, for me, is nice, because now she looks something like the stereotype I've created in my head, all smoke-cloud sexuality and caffeinated brittleness. Annoyingly, though, she isn't a disappointed woman in real life. She doesn't even have Carmela's long nails or her penchant for liberally applied make up or pastels. She's swathed in cream to rhyme with her blonde hair, that problematic signifier of her Italian-Swedish heritage that has deprived her, she says, of Italian-American roles that have in the past gone to dark-haired actresses like Annabella Sciorra and Marisa Tomei. Why is a woman with a finally burgeoning acting career working in London? After all, she's pining for her dog Marley, not to mention her boyfriend, actor-director John Devlin. Why come to Shaftesbury Avenue when she's the talk of US TV-land? A lot of people tried to talk her out of working in London: \"My agent was like, 'if you have to'. It didn't make sense in career terms. But I have been so successful in following my heart. I have made a lot of terrible career decisions. But this is what I want to do as an actor: there are stories I want to help tell, experiences I want to have. \"I wasn't sure that the play would work here: the jokes are so specific to New York. But the previews I've done indicate to me that they get the references. What's surprised me is that the audiences are even more ebullient than the best New York crowds. I thought they would be reserved! \"As a kid in Long Island, I was like, 'don't even bother dreaming of going to London'. It was a place where theatre is revered, the home of acting, and it was so far beyond me it was untrue. So when the opportunity presented itself, there wasn't a choice for me. It was just a matter of working out my schedule so I could do it.\" There is another advantage to working in London for five months.

      "body": "<p>Tugboat Annie, she ain't. For one thing her girth is too modest: 5ft 3in, 130 lbs; then her range is too vast. Linda Greenlaw, still under 40, was skipper of a \"longliner\" fishing boat working out of Maine, US, for 15 years, regularly steaming across 1,000 miles of ocean in search of swordfish. </p> <p>Thirty days at sea was about average, with an all-male crew. She is an unaffected, forthright woman, and she disposes of the obvious question of chauvinism directly. \"It was never a problem. But people who ask me about it just don't believe this. They are disappointed. I have been interviewed by women who say, 'Oh, come on, you must be able to think of something.' They just don't want to take no for an answer. The relationship onboard is like what you read about firemen. Fishing is a fraternity. Maybe, being a woman, fraternity isn't the word. But accepting the masculine terms doesn't bother me.\" </p> <p>The crucial element in her relationship with the crew seems to be that she had professional authority. \"I could do any job onboard a man could do.\" And there is a bonus in being a woman: \"Men have to keep up with or outdo a woman,\" she says. \"It's a macho thing. If I work 18 hours a day, they will work 20.\" </p> <p>There was another problem. Old-time fishermen regard women as Jonahs: they bring back luck. But when she started to bring home catches of 50,000lbs of swordfish, they began to call her Lucky Linda. </p> <p>It was when Sebastian Junger described Greenlaw as \"one of the best captains on the entire US east coast\" in his bestseller The Perfect Storm that she found urgent messages on her answering machine from US publishers. The result is The Hungry Ocean, in which she takes one 30-day fishing expedition, high in catch but scuppered financially by falling markets and foul weather, to describe her relationship with the sea. </p> <p>Her father is a \"suit-and-tie guy\", a financial executive in a large ship-building company. He thought she was going to go to law school \"but after graduation I knew at 19 what I wanted to do with my life\". She is also a product of a traditional, one might say antiquated, island community. She was born and brought up on Isle au Haut, Maine, 65 inhabitants; no bridge connection to the mainland seven miles away; no cinema; one store, nothing but woods and sea to fill the imagination. </p> <p>By the time she was 15, she had headed for the sea, initially taking out her father's powerboat then going on a friend's trawler as a cook. When an accident left the crew a man short, she was allowed to work on deck, and rapidly became a helmsman.

      "bodyText": "Tugboat Annie, she ain't. For one thing her girth is too modest: 5ft 3in, 130 lbs; then her range is too vast. Linda Greenlaw, still under 40, was skipper of a \"longliner\" fishing boat working out of Maine, US, for 15 years, regularly steaming across 1,000 miles of ocean in search of swordfish. Thirty days at sea was about average, with an all-male crew. She is an unaffected, forthright woman, and she disposes of the obvious question of chauvinism directly. \"It was never a problem. But people who ask me about it just don't believe this. They are disappointed. I have been interviewed by women who say, 'Oh, come on, you must be able to think of something.' They just don't want to take no for an answer. The relationship onboard is like what you read about firemen. Fishing is a fraternity. Maybe, being a woman, fraternity isn't the word. But accepting the masculine terms doesn't bother me.\" The crucial element in her relationship with the crew seems to be that she had professional authority. \"I could do any job onboard a man could do.\" And there is a bonus in being a woman: \"Men have to keep up with or outdo a woman,\" she says. \"It's a macho thing. If I work 18 hours a day, they will work 20.\" There was another problem. Old-time fishermen regard women as Jonahs: they bring back luck. But when she started to bring home catches of 50,000lbs of swordfish, they began to call her Lucky Linda. It was when Sebastian Junger described Greenlaw as \"one of the best captains on the entire US east coast\" in his bestseller The Perfect Storm that she found urgent messages on her answering machine from US publishers. The result is The Hungry Ocean, in which she takes one 30-day fishing expedition, high in catch but scuppered financially by falling markets and foul weather, to describe her relationship with the sea. Her father is a \"suit-and-tie guy\", a financial executive in a large ship-building company. He thought she was going to go to law school \"but after graduation I knew at 19 what I wanted to do with my life\". She is also a product of a traditional, one might say antiquated, island community. She was born and brought up on Isle au Haut, Maine, 65 inhabitants; no bridge connection to the mainland seven miles away; no cinema; one store, nothing but woods and sea to fill the imagination. By the time she was 15, she had headed for the sea, initially taking out her father's powerboat then going on a friend's trawler as a cook. When an accident left the crew a man short, she was allowed to work on deck, and rapidly became a helmsman. Pretty soon she was skipper of the Hannah Boden. In terms of hardship and danger, life at sea has not changed. Being washed overboard is considered an easy way to go. What the fisherman fears most is the lethal longliner's hook. \"Size and sharpness render hooks unforgiving when they decide to dive into and tear through flesh,\" she writes. \"Just as fatal are the internal injuries that result from being crushed under the weight of a rogue wave.\" But Greenlaw is also a modern captain, who can gut a fish and toss a Doppler with the best.

      "body": "<p>Where ignorance is bliss, 'tis jolly to be wise - Dennis Wise, that is, who will tonight represent Kevin Keegan's latest attempt to solve the eternal England problem of not being able to put more than two passes together without giving the ball away. </p> <p>The 33-year-old Chelsea captain has been sent off 11 times in his career and six times in the past 18 months. Even now he faces another misconduct charge from the Football Association after a fight in the Stamford Bridge tunnel after the game between Chelsea and Wimbledon 11 days ago. </p> <p>Nevertheless Keegan has convinced himself that Wise's bad disciplinary record should not prevent him being given a chance against Argentina to show that, alongside David Beckham and Paul Scholes, he can pass, tackle and organise well enough to be worthy of consideration for the European Championship squad. </p> <p>\"Dennis Wise's consistency for Chelsea has been tremendous,\" Keegan insisted yesterday. \"A lot of things surrounding him have overtaken his performances on the field but he deserves an opportunity and what better game than this for him to answer his critics? </p> <p>\"I can't defend his disciplinary record but, as far as I'm concerned, this will be a fresh start for him. I think I can trust him, or I wouldn't play him. He is an aggressive player, a winner, and he does care. You can see that. He's also got courage, although sometimes, as he would probably be the first to admit, he has overstepped the mark.\" </p> <p>For Wise's growing army of critics this will smack of calling up John McVicar when someone has lost the keys to the local bank. Yet in pure footballing terms there is certain logic in preferring a ball-player who can tackle a bit, like Wise, to Paul Ince, a ball-winner with a limited range of passes. </p> <p>At the same time the choice of Wise in his testimonial season is a reminder of how desperately short of top-class creative talent Keegan is. Wise's international career has experienced false starts under Graham Taylor and Terry Venables. </p> <p>This evening Wise and Beckham will take it in turns to hold in midfield while Scholes moves forward to support Alan Shearer and his latest partner, Emile Heskey. As a husky 22-year-old with useful pace Heskey is worth a try and Liverpool rate him highly enough to want to sign him from Leicester. But as a striking combination England are unlikely to see football's answer to Torvill and Dean. </p> <p>Yesterday Shearer overdid the praise slightly when he declared that Heskey was \"probably a bit like Batistuta in a way; he hasn't scored as many goals but is in a similar mould\". Tonight, should Gabriel Batistuta be in the mood, the extravagance of that statement may become apparent. </p> <p>Another danger for Keegan tonight is that an exercise designed to enhance the shape and make-up of the side that faces Portugal in Eindhoven on June 12 in England's opening match of Euro 2000 will founder on a lack of understanding between players who have appeared together only fleetingly at this level if at all. </p> <p>The Wise who binds together the movements of Chelsea's multi-national team will do well to adapt quickly in a side thrown together and asked to find a pattern capable of taking on a number of accomplished players in one of the world's most settled teams. </p> <p>Seven of the side Argentina are set to field played against England 19 months ago when Glenn Hoddle's team went out of the World Cup on penalties after the dismissal of Beckham had offset the startling impact of Michael Owen. Ariel Ortega, Juan Veron, Diego Simeone and Javier Zanetti will not freeze in apprehension each time Wise gains possession. </p> <p>Argentina have yet to beat England at Wembley. Much, from England's point of view, will depend on Keegan's back three establishing an early rapport with the midfield that will not allow the opposition to make infiltrating runs to set up chances for Batistuta and Claudio Lopez. </p> <p>Shearer's resurgence of scoring form at Newcastle under Bobby Robson and his renewed enthusiasm for the game looks like England's best hope of victory. And at least the captain will enjoy service from the wings of team-mates present and past: Kieron Dyer, a colleague at St James' Park, and Jason Wilcox, now with Leeds but once a supplier of crosses at Blackburn. </p> <p>For England, whatever the outcome, tonight's exercise will be worthwhile if the latest selection brings about an improvement in passing and movement, so poor against Scotland at Wembley in November. That at least would give Keegan a modicum of encouragement for Euro 2000. </p> <p><strong>England team to face Argentina in tomorrow night's Wembley friendly</strong></p> <p>Seaman (Arsenal)<br> Dyer (Newcastle)<br> Keown (Arsenal)<br> Southgate (Aston Villa)<br> Campbell (Tottenham)<br> Wilcox (Leeds)<br> Wise (Chelsea)<br> Beckham (Man Utd)<br> Scholes (Man Utd)<br> Shearer (Newcastle)<br> Heskey (Leicester)</p> <p><strong>Argentina</strong></p> <p>Burgos<br> Pochettino<br>Sensini<br> Ayala<br> Simeone<br> Veron<br> Gonzalez<br> Zanetti<br> Batistuta<br> Lopez<br> Ortega</p>",

Yesterday Shearer overdid the praise slightly when he declared that Heskey was \"probably a bit like Batistuta in a way; he hasn't scored as many goals but is in a similar mould\". Tonight, should Gabriel Batistuta be in the mood, the extravagance of that statement may become apparent. Another danger for Keegan tonight is that an exercise designed to enhance the shape and make-up of the side that faces Portugal in Eindhoven on June 12 in England's opening match of Euro 2000 will founder on a lack of understanding between players who have appeared together only fleetingly at this level if at all. The Wise who binds together the movements of Chelsea's multi-national team will do well to adapt quickly in a side thrown together and asked to find a pattern capable of taking on a number of accomplished players in one of the world's most settled teams. Seven of the side Argentina are set to field played against England 19 months ago when Glenn Hoddle's team went out of the World Cup on penalties after the dismissal of Beckham had offset the startling impact of Michael Owen. Ariel Ortega, Juan Veron, Diego Simeone and Javier Zanetti will not freeze in apprehension each time Wise gains possession. Argentina have yet to beat England at Wembley. Much, from England's point of view, will depend on Keegan's back three establishing an early rapport with the midfield that will not allow the opposition to make infiltrating runs to set up chances for Batistuta and Claudio Lopez. Shearer's resurgence of scoring form at Newcastle under Bobby Robson and his renewed enthusiasm for the game looks like England's best hope of victory. And at least the captain will enjoy service from the wings of team-mates present and past: Kieron Dyer, a colleague at St James' Park, and Jason Wilcox, now with Leeds but once a supplier of crosses at Blackburn. For England, whatever the outcome, tonight's exercise will be worthwhile if the latest selection brings about an improvement in passing and movement, so poor against Scotland at Wembley in November. That at least would give Keegan a modicum of encouragement for Euro 2000.

Mr Hampton and David Varney, the chief executive, appealed to the missing Sids and relatives or heirs to claim back the up to \u00a314m owed them. </p> <p>This emerged as BG, announcing flat \u00a31.2bn pre-tax profits for last year which were ahead of City expectations, set out a series of projects at home and abroad to attract investors and boost its share price. </p> <p>Mr Varney, a keen formula one fan, said the group planned to market new hi-tech, dual fuel engines capable of running on compressed or liquid natural gas as well as petrol or diesel for polluted urban transport networks. </p> <p>BG, which has helped Lotus develop the Elise, believes the engines developed by BMW, Mercedes and Volvo could, for example, power London's buses and taxis. </p> <p>Projects are already running in Argentina and Egypt, where the energy group supplies gas to domestic consumers and transport authorities. </p> <p>BG, which expects earnings to be boosted this year by the delayed impact of the surge in oil prices, also hopes to break further into the liberalised Eu ropean market as consumers demand lower prices and better service compared with those on offer from state or regional monopolies. </p> <p>Mr Varney said BG's pipeline business, Transco - which already supplies parts of Europe through the interconnector to Belgium - had the sophisticated IT systems that enabled 60 shippers to deliver gas over the consumer network. Europe's systems, in comparison, were \"like a Sunday outing\". </p> <p>BG's chief executive confirmed that it was talking to a number of telecoms companies about using its pipeline network to install high speed telephony and internet access, both here and abroad. </p> <p>Mr Varney, refusing to comment on reports that BG would team up with Energis, cable company Telewest or Freeserve, the internet service provider, said the goal was to produce one or more alliances later this year.</p>",

Philip Hampton, BG's finance director, said after the restructuring and share buyback scheme BG had a shareholder base of just 1.1m compared with 1.7m on demerger with what is now Centrica. The missing 150,000 hold between 20 and 30 shares each. Mr Hampton and David Varney, the chief executive, appealed to the missing Sids and relatives or heirs to claim back the up to \u00a314m owed them. This emerged as BG, announcing flat \u00a31.2bn pre-tax profits for last year which were ahead of City expectations, set out a series of projects at home and abroad to attract investors and boost its share price. Mr Varney, a keen formula one fan, said the group planned to market new hi-tech, dual fuel engines capable of running on compressed or liquid natural gas as well as petrol or diesel for polluted urban transport networks. BG, which has helped Lotus develop the Elise, believes the engines developed by BMW, Mercedes and Volvo could, for example, power London's buses and taxis. Projects are already running in Argentina and Egypt, where the energy group supplies gas to domestic consumers and transport authorities. BG, which expects earnings to be boosted this year by the delayed impact of the surge in oil prices, also hopes to break further into the liberalised Eu ropean market as consumers demand lower prices and better service compared with those on offer from state or regional monopolies. Mr Varney said BG's pipeline business, Transco - which already supplies parts of Europe through the interconnector to Belgium - had the sophisticated IT systems that enabled 60 shippers to deliver gas over the consumer network. Europe's systems, in comparison, were \"like a Sunday outing\". BG's chief executive confirmed that it was talking to a number of telecoms companies about using its pipeline network to install high speed telephony and internet access, both here and abroad. Mr Varney, refusing to comment on reports that BG would team up with Energis, cable company Telewest or Freeserve, the internet service provider, said the goal was to produce one or more alliances later this year.",

      "body": "<p>First come the rumours. Weeks, months, even years in advance, whispers of a profit slump, a cost-cutting merger, a radical \"restructuring\" whip workplaces into bubbling crucibles of speculation. So that, when a swingeing round of redundancies is finally announced - as this week at Unilever, which plans to sack 25,000 workers worldwide in the next five years; at insurers CGU and Norwich Union, due to shed at least 4,000 posts when they merge; and at Ford's Dagenham plant, where 1,500 job losses were announced last week - the immediate, visceral response can be an entirely incongruous surge of relief. </p> <p>\"At least, when the details come, you finally have an idea of what you're dealing with,\" recalls Helen, a senior employee of a major corporation based at Canary Wharf, who kept her post when her employers implemented a harsh round of job cuts in 1997. \"Living in limbo, knowing the axe is going to fall but not on whom, is particularly grim.\" </p> <p>Nobody who has experienced redundancy needs telling about the often huge personal and financial costs of losing one's job. What's less widely appreciated - though employers are finally beginning to heed the warnings of occupational psychologists - is how much damage can be done between the time when numbers are announced and the notices of redundancy received, even for those who hang on to their jobs. If the nation's employers had deliberately plotted a system designed to foster maximum insecurity and bad feeling in their workforces, they could hardly have come up with a better method than the current strategy of rumours first, numbers second, and specific names a long, long time afterwards. </p> <p>\"Fear and bewilderment,\" says Simon, a banker working at the south-east division of a high-street bank, when asked to recall his colleagues' response to a recent announcement of impending redundancies. \"Why us? Why now? Why, when the bank is making such huge profits, are they making us redundant?\" </p> <p>Office camaraderie vanishes in a trice as workers struggle to second-guess the management's impenetrable logic. \"There's not an awful lot of team spirit now,\" says Simon. Conflicts of loyalties escalate into full-scale wars as employees try to balance solidarity with self-interest. \"Especially for those with families to support. It's 'What am I going to do if it's me?' Everyone's looking at everyone else, and wondering: 'What if I'm next?'\" </p> <p>But the problem is that an employer's logic isn't always particularly logical. \"The odd thing is that you can guess, but what you're thinking is often unfair: that this person isn't going to be sacked even though they're completely crap, because management can't afford to pay them off,\" says Helen. \"There was always a feeling that it was going to be the Indians and not the chiefs, the workers who were actually producing rather than the paper-pushers and memo-writers. On the other hand, my salary was so incredibly low that I thought I'd be too cheap to bother firing.\" </p> <p>If there are still any neanderthal senior managers who believe that the paranoia of job-cut limbo keeps workers keyed-up and competitive, they're very, very wrong. Psychological studies show that productivity plummets during the grim wait for letters of redundancy - not least because levels of health decline drastically. In a 1995 study, researchers from University College London analysed 10,300 civil servants, and found vastly increased levels of ill health among those who worked through years of threatened unemployment. (Female employees proved disproportionately at risk from psychological illness, while males were more likely to suffer physically.) </p> <p>The findings held good even disregarding the effects of excessive drinking and smoking and lack of exercise - although, Helen remembers, there's plenty of that too. \"Productivity fell by about 80%. It took over the office, and brought everything to a standstill - even though everyone knew bloody well the decisions had been made, they would be in the pub every night discussing it. People were terribly hung over for an awful lot of the time.\" </p> <p>A brave face is not an uncommon response. \"People over 50 had badges printed saying they were 50 and didn't care if they were made redundant, because they'd get a pension,\" says Mike, who was laid off two years ago by a water company that is still slashing staff numbers. But appearances can be deceptive, Helen says. \"The people who at first said they'd be glad to take a cheque and get out were the ones in tears when it came to leaving.\" </p> <p>How the news is communicated can make all the difference, according to Jenny Summerfield, business psychologist and author of a book on workplace counselling. \"Organisations find it difficult to be upfront, but that's what they've got to do,\" she says. \"People may, over time, stop resenting the fact that they lost their jobs, but they will never forget how they were told. If they're taken aside in small groups, given explanations and immediate support, they will remember that the company treated them humanely, even though it fired them.\" </p> <p>This, though, is an ideal rather than the reality. Mike's experience was more typical: \"The company likes to get rid of people at the end of March, which, because of the notice period, meant people were always made redundant just before Christmas,\" he says. \"There was a lot of despondency, and illness among workers but also among their families.\" Helen, too, shudders at the memory of her company's insensitive \"dawn raid\" methods. \"People were called before they left for work, and asked to come and see a manager. My friend recorded her conversation on her answering machine, and on the tape you can hear her fighting back tears.\" </p> <p>Counterintuitively, among those most detrimentally affected may be those who appear, at first, least deserving of sympathy: the ones who remain. In America - borrowing rather inappropriately from psychological studies of the Holocaust - they call this \"survivor syndrome\"; whatever you call it, Summerfield says, its effects are hard to deny. In extreme cases, employees who keep their jobs - with increased workload, insecurity and paranoia - end up suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder's sister condition, prolonged-duress stress disorder. </p> <p>\"One way to get over post-traumatic stress is to remove yourself from the situation, but with prolonged-duress stress you can't do that,\" she explains. \"People have to keep coming into work every day. Employers will often assume that people are grateful just to have kept their jobs, but the levels of demotivation can be huge.\" </p> <p>Mike knows exactly how it feels. \"By the time I was made redundant, our department covered an area three times bigger than when I started. Because there was no theory behind the redundancies, people just didn't understand how those jobs were going to be done when they left.\" And judging by the tone of his voice, he's not entirely unhappy that he got out when he did. </p> <p>\u0095 Some names have been changed.</p>",

Why, when the bank is making such huge profits, are they making us redundant?\" Office camaraderie vanishes in a trice as workers struggle to second-guess the management's impenetrable logic. \"There's not an awful lot of team spirit now,\" says Simon. Conflicts of loyalties escalate into full-scale wars as employees try to balance solidarity with self-interest. \"Especially for those with families to support. It's 'What am I going to do if it's me?' Everyone's looking at everyone else, and wondering: 'What if I'm next?'\" But the problem is that an employer's logic isn't always particularly logical. \"The odd thing is that you can guess, but what you're thinking is often unfair: that this person isn't going to be sacked even though they're completely crap, because management can't afford to pay them off,\" says Helen. \"There was always a feeling that it was going to be the Indians and not the chiefs, the workers who were actually producing rather than the paper-pushers and memo-writers. On the other hand, my salary was so incredibly low that I thought I'd be too cheap to bother firing.\" If there are still any neanderthal senior managers who believe that the paranoia of job-cut limbo keeps workers keyed-up and competitive, they're very, very wrong. Psychological studies show that productivity plummets during the grim wait for letters of redundancy - not least because levels of health decline drastically. In a 1995 study, researchers from University College London analysed 10,300 civil servants, and found vastly increased levels of ill health among those who worked through years of threatened unemployment. (Female employees proved disproportionately at risk from psychological illness, while males were more likely to suffer physically.) The findings held good even disregarding the effects of excessive drinking and smoking and lack of exercise - although, Helen remembers, there's plenty of that too. \"Productivity fell by about 80%. It took over the office, and brought everything to a standstill - even though everyone knew bloody well the decisions had been made, they would be in the pub every night discussing it. People were terribly hung over for an awful lot of the time.\" A brave face is not an uncommon response. \"People over 50 had badges printed saying they were 50 and didn't care if they were made redundant, because they'd get a pension,\" says Mike, who was laid off two years ago by a water company that is still slashing staff numbers. But appearances can be deceptive, Helen says. \"The people who at first said they'd be glad to take a cheque and get out were the ones in tears when it came to leaving.\" How the news is communicated can make all the difference, according to Jenny Summerfield, business psychologist and author of a book on workplace counselling. \"Organisations find it difficult to be upfront, but that's what they've got to do,\" she says. \"People may, over time, stop resenting the fact that they lost their jobs, but they will never forget how they were told. If they're taken aside in small groups, given explanations and immediate support, they will remember that the company treated them humanely, even though it fired them.\" This, though, is an ideal rather than the reality. Mike's experience was more typical: \"The company likes to get rid of people at the end of March, which, because of the notice period, meant people were always made redundant just before Christmas,\" he says. \"There was a lot of despondency, and illness among workers but also among their families.\" Helen, too, shudders at the memory of her company's insensitive \"dawn raid\" methods. \"People were called before they left for work, and asked to come and see a manager. My friend recorded her conversation on her answering machine, and on the tape you can hear her fighting back tears.\" Counterintuitively, among those most detrimentally affected may be those who appear, at first, least deserving of sympathy: the ones who remain. In America - borrowing rather inappropriately from psychological studies of the Holocaust - they call this \"survivor syndrome\"; whatever you call it, Summerfield says, its effects are hard to deny. In extreme cases, employees who keep their jobs - with increased workload, insecurity and paranoia - end up suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder's sister condition, prolonged-duress stress disorder. \"One way to get over post-traumatic stress is to remove yourself from the situation, but with prolonged-duress stress you can't do that,\" she explains. \"People have to keep coming into work every day. Employers will often assume that people are grateful just to have kept their jobs, but the levels of demotivation can be huge.\" Mike knows exactly how it feels. \"By the time I was made redundant, our department covered an area three times bigger than when I started. Because there was no theory behind the redundancies, people just didn't understand how those jobs were going to be done when they left.\" And judging by the tone of his voice, he's not entirely unhappy that he got out when he did. \u0095 Some names have been changed.",
