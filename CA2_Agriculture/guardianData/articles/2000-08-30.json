      "body": "<p> This was to have been the start of Claudio Abbado's final visit to the Proms as artistic director of the Berlin Philharmonic, a post he relinquishes to Simon Rattle in 2002. Illness, however, has forced Abbado to withdraw, and his concerts have been taken over by Bernard Haitink a conductor with whom the orchestra has established a considerable rapport. </p> <p>The programme opened with the Prelude and Liebestod from Wagner's Tristan und Isolde. Haitink is due to conduct the complete work at Covent Garden in October, and this provided us with a sneak pre view. He avoids both the erotic approach favoured by some and the wild prefiguration of Freudian neurosis stressed by others. In their place is something much more spiritual. Haitink seems acutely conscious of the work's philosophical underpinnings - the staining of voluptuousness with Schopenhauerian pessimism, with its emphasis on the futility of human striving and the need for the dissolution of the ego in transcendental experience. He opts for sensuous rather than sexy textures , and presents us with music which seems to emerge from eternity into time and then retreat back into infinity. The famous opening phase slides from silence into sound like the first stirrings of desire slowly taking shape. The Prelude's climax has a frantic urgency, while the Liebestod swirls towards mysticism rather than orgasm. The crescendo and decrescendo through the final chord brings peace and stillness. </p> <p>It's impressive, moving and profound, though just occasionally there were problems of balance, with the Berlin brass - not quite at their best throughout the evening - tending to be over-dominant. </p> <p>Bruckner's Seventh Symphony followed. This has always been one of Haitink's great tours de force, though his interpretation has changed and deepened over time. Speeds have become more extreme, with the first movement faster and the Adagio considerably slower than I've heard him take them before. Dynamic and textural contrasts have become more emphatic, and the work's emotional palette has widened. </p> <p>He still avoids the sensuality that some conductors, notably Riccardo Chailly, have brought to the work of late, though the work's mystic aspects are now balanced by the humane.

      "bodyText": "This was to have been the start of Claudio Abbado's final visit to the Proms as artistic director of the Berlin Philharmonic, a post he relinquishes to Simon Rattle in 2002. Illness, however, has forced Abbado to withdraw, and his concerts have been taken over by Bernard Haitink a conductor with whom the orchestra has established a considerable rapport. The programme opened with the Prelude and Liebestod from Wagner's Tristan und Isolde. Haitink is due to conduct the complete work at Covent Garden in October, and this provided us with a sneak pre view. He avoids both the erotic approach favoured by some and the wild prefiguration of Freudian neurosis stressed by others. In their place is something much more spiritual. Haitink seems acutely conscious of the work's philosophical underpinnings - the staining of voluptuousness with Schopenhauerian pessimism, with its emphasis on the futility of human striving and the need for the dissolution of the ego in transcendental experience. He opts for sensuous rather than sexy textures , and presents us with music which seems to emerge from eternity into time and then retreat back into infinity. The famous opening phase slides from silence into sound like the first stirrings of desire slowly taking shape. The Prelude's climax has a frantic urgency, while the Liebestod swirls towards mysticism rather than orgasm. The crescendo and decrescendo through the final chord brings peace and stillness. It's impressive, moving and profound, though just occasionally there were problems of balance, with the Berlin brass - not quite at their best throughout the evening - tending to be over-dominant. Bruckner's Seventh Symphony followed. This has always been one of Haitink's great tours de force, though his interpretation has changed and deepened over time. Speeds have become more extreme, with the first movement faster and the Adagio considerably slower than I've heard him take them before. Dynamic and textural contrasts have become more emphatic, and the work's emotional palette has widened. He still avoids the sensuality that some conductors, notably Riccardo Chailly, have brought to the work of late, though the work's mystic aspects are now balanced by the humane. The great focal Adagio, its composition affected by the news of Wagner's death, is at once a solemn ritual, a vision of transcendence and an expression of the most profound grief; its impact, on this occasion, was shattering.",

The move has already been largely discounted by the market, traders said. \"What's driving the euro down against the dollar at the moment isn't ECB policies, it's market positioning and merger and acquisition flows,\" Dresdner Kleinwort Benson currency strategist Jesper Dannesboe said. \"So if the euro does react tomorrow this must be blamed on the market and not the ECB.\" Expectations that the US economy is heading for a soft landing is driving the dollar's strength against other currencies. It hit a seven-year high of 1.4424 against sterling at one point yesterday. Sterling recovered some ground later in the day, to finish in London at $1.4567.",

      "bodyText": "John Hartson was last night hoping to revive his fortunes with the most surprising move yet of his turbulent career as Rangers worked feverishly to finalise a \u00a37m deal against the clock. The Welsh striker's elevation from relegated Wimbledon to the champions of Scotland was hinging on a stringent medical in Glasgow which must be completed and passed by this morning if the 25-year-old player is to become a Rangers player in time to beat the deadline for the Champions League. Indeed the Rangers chairman David Murray, who has been a long-time admirer of the fiery striker, admitted that the time pressures could scupper the deal, the FA of Wales having insisted earlier that he rejoin the national squad in time for a 10am flight today to Minsk before Saturday's World Cup qualifier with Belarus. Murray, who quickly agreed personal terms with Hartson, said last night: \"There is the possibility that the medical might not go well because it is very strict. \"We would ask him to stay a bit longer tomorrow, but he has to catch up with the Welsh squad in Belarus and that might stop us doing a full medical - and if that is the case then it is a possibility that the deal will be off. \"We have made mistakes in the past and we don't want those things to happen again. But he is staying here tonight.\" Hartson earlier talked passionately about his willingness to join the Ibrox cause - \"there is nothing bigger than Rangers\" - but was then facing the potential distress of another major move breaking down after his projected \u00a36m transfer to Tottenham in March was scuppered by a medical uncovering knee trouble. If Hartson passes this medical he will join another recruit, the Dutch international midfielder Ronald de Boer, who has already passed a medical and said last night that he was \"to all intents and purposes a Rangers player\" after denying his \u00a36m move from Barcelona had stalled.

Ambrose simply did what he had done since his debut in Georgetown five years earlier: bowled unfailingly in the right place with uncommon bounce from his great height (the Aussie press delighted in referring to him as the \"two-metre Antiguan\") and a hint of movement. The ball was drawn magnetically, mesmerically, to the edge of the bat. That one spell encapsulated almost everything of Ambrose: pace, skill, accuracy unparalleled in a genuinely fast bowler, aggression, courage and the capacity to produce devastating bursts of wickets when the integrity of West Indies cricket was at stake.</p> <p>In 1990, he sent England spiralling to defeat in the final session in Bridgetown, taking five for 18 in a 7.4-over spell with the second new ball that brought his best Test figures of eight for 45.

They again show wide variation between the leading providers and those making up the rear. At the head of the list is Oxford which has excellent Ofsted inspection grades and some 70 per cent of the intake have good degrees. Homerton College is second and the University of East Anglia third just in front of Cambridge University. From the bottom up the order is Huddersfield, North London, Open and East London.

One puff and it's gone, completely deniable. What me? Racist? It works like magic. Everyone gets the message, yet nothing tangible remains. It was a quiet bank holiday with no news beyond the Tory slippage in the polls so into the void stepped Dr Liam Fox, Conservative health spokesman, a clever man. </p> <p>With great finesse he suggests that foreign doctors \"can be fatal\", \"patients are suffering at their hands\" and \"this is an issue of patient safety\". Images flash before the eyes of his blue-rinse party members - doctors with funny names and weird accents who turn up as locums in the middle of the night \"can be fatal\"! Every innate suspicion of foreigners, every atavistic fear of otherness is nicely stirred. Peter Sellers' comic Indian doctor with his \"needle in the Punjab\" is the kind of joke they still really enjoy. So Dr Fox's comments do the political business. The clear message goes out - the Tories will bring back Doctor Finlay, no more darkies on the wards. </p> <p>Of course he never said that but the joy of race is that it only has to be breathed. So he said the Tories would bring in tougher language tests and tougher medical exams for all foreign doctors, including those already practising. With no evidence, no research and apparently zero knowledge of how the system works, his cavalier assault on the quarter of doctors now working in the NHS who trained elsewhere was insulting and unpleasant. Fox concentrated his remarks on what he claimed was their poor language skills, saying: \"In potential life-and-death situations having a minimal standard of proficiency in English can be fatal.\" He just threw in the need to toughen the medical exams as an apparent afterthought. But it planted the idea - voodoo third world stuff, jungle doctors, jungle medicine. </p> <p>Naturally he has vehemently denied racism. He would, wouldn't he? But why on earth did he choose to bring up such a minor issue among the plethora of NHS inadequacies for which there are good figures and damning evidence, instead of just gut prejudice? He had a point about the lack of language tests for EU doctors working here - but did he really mean the fatal threat of a Frenchman? </p> <p>What's the best evidence available? Rather more complaints about foreign-trained doctors are received by the General Medical Council sent in by other public bodies in relation to the number there are practising, but then rather fewer complaints against overseas doctors are sent in by the general public. There is no evidence that patients try to change doctors to avoid foreigners. In a specialism with an acute shortage, Professor John Lilleyman, president of the Royal College of Pathologists, dismissed Dr Fox's remarks. \"Thirty years ago some doctors could barely string two words of English together, but it's all changed now. As for communication skills, there are plenty of doctors born and bred in the home counties for whom communication with their patients is a serious problem.\" There is a shortage of pathologists, with 100 consultant jobs unfilled: Wigan district general has one part-timer instead of three full-timers, putting cancer and other diagnoses at risk. </p> <p>Since 1979 overseas doctors have taken a stringent English language test (but not those from the EU). Doctors have to pass the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), run by the British Council, at grade 7 or above (postgraduate academic level) both written and oral. Professor John Cox, president of the Royal College of Psychiatry, says that Dr Fox has no evidence. \"He is casting a slur on overseas doctors. We find British doctors are just as likely to have communication problems with patients. We are giving British doctors special training for treating multiethnic communities with deep cultural differences.\" There are unfilled vacancies for 419 consultant psychiatrists. </p> <p>By calling for \"tougher medical exams\" Fox questions their overall competence. But foreigners already have to sit two medical exams, called PLABs, so tough that when 50 practising British-trained doctors were randomly asked to sit it only two passed. Hardly surprising since it requires doctors who have specialised for years to relearn the whole medical syllabus from when they first qualified. </p> <p> The real scandal is not incompetent foreigners killing NHS patients, it is the estimated 2,000 refugee doctors, many of them distinguished, who cannot work here. Dr Sheila Cheeroth runs the Refugee Doctor Project at Queen Mary and Westfield College, London. The barriers set up against them are near impossible. She mentions a Somalian who worked as an Assistant Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in Russia, headed the Red Crescent in Somalia during the famine, worked at WHO headquarters in Geneva and speaks five languages. But he can't find medical work. </p> <p>It costs the NHS \u00a3200,000 to train a new doctor. Dr Cheeroth says most of these refugees could be retrained, some for as little as \u00a31,000, most others for \u00a310,000. But those who arrive without money have virtually no chance, however distinguished their experience. To take the PLAB exam costs \u00a3550. To take a short PLAB revision course costs \u00a3625. The IELTS language courses are expensive too. Then doctors need two clinical attachments, lasting about three months each, working alongside an NHS doctor: these are not only unpaid but applicants have to pay \u00a3500 each time, while trying to supporting their families. Dr Cheeroth has set up a weekly study club inside the Royal London Hospital where junior doctors volunteer their time to give teaching and help to overseas aspirants. </p> <p>But getting a post is almost as difficult. I spoke to a pathologist from Iran, who speaks the Queen's English rather better than the Queen. Escaping Iran under threat, he has since sent off scores of applications for training posts, but only ever had one interview. Research published in the BMJ tested racism in medicine by sending out applications for jobs in a variety of specialisms, half with an Asian name, half with an English-sounding name. The Asian names were far less likely to be shortlisted. </p> <p>Asylum seekers are not allowed to work in their first six months, dispersed randomly around the country living on vouchers, with no money for bus fares let alone training courses. After that, the DSS pressures them to take jobs, often cleaning jobs, which makes it even harder for them to study and pass exams. Doctors who become refugees are among the most educated and sophisticated people who arrive here. Although the Refugee Council and others offer what courses they can, only 20% of refugee doctors ever practice medicine again. The scandal is the waste. </p> <p>Dr Fox was not replying to his pager yesterday. Why should he?

      "body": "<p>Wordsworth's famous lines will soon need to be updated. \"I wandered lonely as a cloud, That floats on high o'er hill and dale, When all at once I saw a huge billboard telling me to fcuk fashion.\" The government has announced that advertising hoardings will now be permitted across most of the English countryside. Clearly the millions of visitors to our shores this summer were disappointed that the views across rural England were not obscured by enormous posters and so the government have stepped in to put this right. </p> <p>The abolition of controls originally brought in under the Atlee government follow intensive lobbying from that great lover of our natural heritage, the Outdoor Advertising Council. We are assured that we will still see beautiful scenery in the English countryside, but only as featured on the poster advertising the new Vauxhall Astra. </p> <p>Now the chit-chat on The Archers will be changed forever. \"Ooh I've got terrible problems; no rain for a month, winter cabbage gone to seed and the focus group has revealed that the branding concept on my poster sites is failing to reach the targeted C2s.\" Once farmers have got the advertising bug they might find other ways to get the message across. The sheep in One Man and His Dog won't just be herded into a pen; the collies will have to arrange them on the hillside to spell out: \"You can't get kwikker than a kwik-fit fitter\". Bright yellow mustard will be planted in such a formation that airline passengers flying overhead will see the Nike logo. Bored looking cows will stand around in fields holding placards that say \"Massive golf sale - 100 yards on the left\". </p> <p> There are always more places in which commercials can be placed. Soon it won't be possible to have a hearing aid fitted that doesn't contain a tape that privately plays you the Shake'n'Vac jingle every five minutes. Or what about advertising during the Queens Christmas message? \"At this festive time one's thoughts turn to the Commonwealth, but also to the fact that the World of Leather sale starts 9am Boxing Day at Lakeside Thurrock, Bluewater and Purley Way, Croydon.\" </p> <p>The trouble is, of course, that the more advertisements to which we are exposed, the less effective they become. The first piece of junk mail was probably read quite carefully. John Prescott giving permission to increase the number of poster sites won't result in a corresponding rise in consumption of all the products advertised. We are still only going to buy one car each, John Prescott excepted. Advertising might persuade us to switch from Coca Cola to Pepsi but it won't make us spend money we haven't got on things we don't want. However many times I watch the videos standing in the post office queue, I am still no nearer to buying myself a Stannah stairlift. </p> <p>And yet the advertisers continue their stampede towards devaluing their own currency. I had a drink in a pub in Barnes the other day which featured a TV screen on the wall permanently playing advertisements. As far as I'm concerned this is the end of all civilisation as we know it. I don't know how much Young's brewery or the landlord receive for having this monstrosity ruin the pub, but if The Bulls Head were my local I'd like to try and help raise the same amount to have it taken down again. </p> <p>The proliferation in advertising is steadily eating away our quality of life and is becoming increasingly ineffective as it does so. And the idea that the financial crisis facing British farming can be solved with roadside posters is clearly ridiculous. The farmers in greatest need live in the remotest areas and have no sites of any value. It is true that that the more accessible areas of rural England do receive thousands of visitors every year but it is precisely because they are unspoilt. The act of erecting poster sites will in itself help make the sites valueless. Somehow I can't imagine myself driving down to Somerset to look at the view of Chris Eubank sipping a mug of Nescafe. </p> <p>The way forward is to combine two countryside problems to create an overall solution.

      "bodyText": "Wordsworth's famous lines will soon need to be updated. \"I wandered lonely as a cloud, That floats on high o'er hill and dale, When all at once I saw a huge billboard telling me to fcuk fashion.\" The government has announced that advertising hoardings will now be permitted across most of the English countryside. Clearly the millions of visitors to our shores this summer were disappointed that the views across rural England were not obscured by enormous posters and so the government have stepped in to put this right. The abolition of controls originally brought in under the Atlee government follow intensive lobbying from that great lover of our natural heritage, the Outdoor Advertising Council. We are assured that we will still see beautiful scenery in the English countryside, but only as featured on the poster advertising the new Vauxhall Astra. Now the chit-chat on The Archers will be changed forever. \"Ooh I've got terrible problems; no rain for a month, winter cabbage gone to seed and the focus group has revealed that the branding concept on my poster sites is failing to reach the targeted C2s.\" Once farmers have got the advertising bug they might find other ways to get the message across. The sheep in One Man and His Dog won't just be herded into a pen; the collies will have to arrange them on the hillside to spell out: \"You can't get kwikker than a kwik-fit fitter\". Bright yellow mustard will be planted in such a formation that airline passengers flying overhead will see the Nike logo. Bored looking cows will stand around in fields holding placards that say \"Massive golf sale - 100 yards on the left\". There are always more places in which commercials can be placed. Soon it won't be possible to have a hearing aid fitted that doesn't contain a tape that privately plays you the Shake'n'Vac jingle every five minutes. Or what about advertising during the Queens Christmas message? \"At this festive time one's thoughts turn to the Commonwealth, but also to the fact that the World of Leather sale starts 9am Boxing Day at Lakeside Thurrock, Bluewater and Purley Way, Croydon.\" The trouble is, of course, that the more advertisements to which we are exposed, the less effective they become. The first piece of junk mail was probably read quite carefully. John Prescott giving permission to increase the number of poster sites won't result in a corresponding rise in consumption of all the products advertised. We are still only going to buy one car each, John Prescott excepted. Advertising might persuade us to switch from Coca Cola to Pepsi but it won't make us spend money we haven't got on things we don't want. However many times I watch the videos standing in the post office queue, I am still no nearer to buying myself a Stannah stairlift. And yet the advertisers continue their stampede towards devaluing their own currency. I had a drink in a pub in Barnes the other day which featured a TV screen on the wall permanently playing advertisements. As far as I'm concerned this is the end of all civilisation as we know it. I don't know how much Young's brewery or the landlord receive for having this monstrosity ruin the pub, but if The Bulls Head were my local I'd like to try and help raise the same amount to have it taken down again. The proliferation in advertising is steadily eating away our quality of life and is becoming increasingly ineffective as it does so. And the idea that the financial crisis facing British farming can be solved with roadside posters is clearly ridiculous. The farmers in greatest need live in the remotest areas and have no sites of any value. It is true that that the more accessible areas of rural England do receive thousands of visitors every year but it is precisely because they are unspoilt. The act of erecting poster sites will in itself help make the sites valueless. Somehow I can't imagine myself driving down to Somerset to look at the view of Chris Eubank sipping a mug of Nescafe. The way forward is to combine two countryside problems to create an overall solution. While it is rightly banning fox hunting the government should add an amendment legalising the hunting of advertising executives. Yuppie account handlers will be strolling around the countryside checking out their new advertising hoardings when suddenly the horn will sound and packs of hounds will descend upon them snapping at their Armani suits as red-coated huntsmen gallop across the fields in pursuit. It will become one of the beautiful traditional sights of the English countryside. It's a shame that the billboards will prevent anyone from actually seeing it. And until then we must halt this mercenary tendency to use every imaginable space to try and flog people things.

Or stick pins in an effigy of Chris Sutton. Or chuck all your official merchandise (replica shirt, novelty bowler hat, musical sash, etc.) onto the fire and swear never to march anywhere near Edmiston Drive again. But what would that achieve? Nothing positive, that's for sure. A much more level-headed response would be to breathe deeply, sit down, and quietly wait for your morale to be boosted by some good news.</p> <p>If you did, suicidal Rangers fans, you've been rewarded for your good sense. Because today Dick Advocaat agreed to buy Ronald De Boer from Barcelona for \u00a36m, the Dutch midfielder agreeing personal terms on a four-year contract. De Boer announced the move on his official website <a href=\"http://www.icons.com\">www.icons.com</a>, and next to a huge and frankly scary picture of his head, he wrote: \"I'm about to undergo a medical, which is always a little bit nerve-wracking, but I've been fairly injury-free so everything should be okay on that score. I'm already looking forward to linking up with my new team-mates.\"</p> <p>That's great news guaranteed to cheer up even the bluest bluenose. And the rehabilitation didn't stop there, because Rangers announced that they are also having talks with Wimbledon striker John Hartson. The 25-year-old's agent is believed to be on his way to Glasgow to seal a \u00a37m deal, and the big Welsh loon could be unveiled later today. Now, the Fiver is usually totally impartial in these matters, but we really hope Hartson's signing goes through. Why? Well, picture the next Old Firm game... Big John up front... the crowd whipping him up into a frenzy... and who's that wily Israeli midfielder lining up for the other team?</p> <p><strong>THE LATEST FROM DECAMPED DESCHAMPS</strong></p> <p>It's not often the Fiver ambles up to Frank Leboeuf and mumbles the most difficult word of all: sorry. But, as history will record, today is such a day. Well, sort of. Because a couple of weeks ago, when the arrogant Frenchman claimed that Vialli \"has problems with everybody\", we took \"everybody\" to mean Albert Ferrer and Leboeuf's rather large ego. How wrong we were. Today, Didier Deschamps became the third person in recent months to have a pop at Luca, who he blamed for his poor season at Chelsea. </p> <p>\"In England I had difficulty showing my qualities,\" he moaned for about the 1415th time. \"I arrived from Italy with techniques which were useless in England [insert your own joke here], there were too many games and no break in December.\" But it was loveable Luca who caused Didi the most problems. \"I felt very frustrated on the pitch and also in my relationships with Vialli, which were difficult or even impossible. It was hard because I had a very different opinion of him as a player from the coach he became.\" Unresolved issues, anyone?</p> <p>Before the Fiver could direct Didier to Dr Raj Persaud's home page, the mini-sized midfield general went on to echo He Is He Was's comments about the underlying racism in English football: \"A foreigner is less protected than a British player. It's a paradox because there are very good English referees who can perform very well in a European game but are too fussy or too lax in the Premier League. No one really complains about it - neither the public nor the media - and I'm not here to tell them they are wrong.\" Of course you're not Didi, but we get the message all the same.</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I am not here to defend them. I know what they're feeling. But let's put it all in perspective. They haven't murdered anybody, no one has been raped and no drugs have been sold. They made a mistake.

[Tok] Nice one! Now, what did you want to say? \"Obviously when you don't get success, then people maybe perceive you as not being very good. We need to get out there and get a little bit more respect back, that's certainly what I'm going for.\" Sorry to interrupt... chuck us that deodorant, will you? </p> <p>[Fling] Thanks! You were saying? \"I didn't think we played particularly well against the Germans, to be honest with you. I watched that game and I was very disappointed with the way we passed the ball. Sometimes it can disguise what's going on under the surface and put a few plasters on the cracks, so it will be more the manner of the performance in Paris which matters.\" Coming down the pub for an orange juice, Tone? Got to meet the girlfriend.</p> <p>[Tug, tug, tug] Tony! It's hard enough to catch the barman's eye without you pulling away at the leg of our trousers! Behave yourself and tell us how you think Alan Shearer's retirement will affect the way England play. \"When you've got a dominant centre-forward like Alan, you kind of get stuck in a role that you want to play. Certain individuals do influence the way that you play.\" So do you think England could become a better with a new Shearer-free attacking approach? \"Hopefully. That's what I'm aiming for.\" We wish you luck, Tone, and... hey, is that little bloke in cricket whites waving at you?</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Leeds are preparing a move for Hertha Berlin striker Ali Daei, according to Teamtalk.

Today, Didier Deschamps became the third person in recent months to have a pop at Luca, who he blamed for his poor season at Chelsea. \"In England I had difficulty showing my qualities,\" he moaned for about the 1415th time. \"I arrived from Italy with techniques which were useless in England [insert your own joke here], there were too many games and no break in December.\" But it was loveable Luca who caused Didi the most problems. \"I felt very frustrated on the pitch and also in my relationships with Vialli, which were difficult or even impossible. It was hard because I had a very different opinion of him as a player from the coach he became.\" Unresolved issues, anyone? Before the Fiver could direct Didier to Dr Raj Persaud's home page, the mini-sized midfield general went on to echo He Is He Was's comments about the underlying racism in English football: \"A foreigner is less protected than a British player. It's a paradox because there are very good English referees who can perform very well in a European game but are too fussy or too lax in the Premier League. No one really complains about it - neither the public nor the media - and I'm not here to tell them they are wrong.\" Of course you're not Didi, but we get the message all the same. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I am not here to defend them. I know what they're feeling. But let's put it all in perspective. They haven't murdered anybody, no one has been raped and no drugs have been sold. They made a mistake. But I have made more mistakes than anyone\" - Roy Keane QC cleverly juxtaposes different crimes to defend Irish team-mates Phil Starsky and Mark Hutch. PHYSIO REPORT [Bounce, bounce, bounce] What's that noise ? Why... it's little Tony Adams! Hello mate. You want to tell us about your ambitions for the England team? OK, before you do, pelt this football at that boring bald bloke's head, will you? [Tok] Nice one! Now, what did you want to say? \"Obviously when you don't get success, then people maybe perceive you as not being very good. We need to get out there and get a little bit more respect back, that's certainly what I'm going for.\" Sorry to interrupt... chuck us that deodorant, will you? [Fling] Thanks! You were saying? \"I didn't think we played particularly well against the Germans, to be honest with you. I watched that game and I was very disappointed with the way we passed the ball. Sometimes it can disguise what's going on under the surface and put a few plasters on the cracks, so it will be more the manner of the performance in Paris which matters.\" Coming down the pub for an orange juice, Tone? Got to meet the girlfriend. [Tug, tug, tug] Tony! It's hard enough to catch the barman's eye without you pulling away at the leg of our trousers! Behave yourself and tell us how you think Alan Shearer's retirement will affect the way England play. \"When you've got a dominant centre-forward like Alan, you kind of get stuck in a role that you want to play. Certain individuals do influence the way that you play.\" So do you think England could become a better with a new Shearer-free attacking approach? \"Hopefully. That's what I'm aiming for.\" We wish you luck, Tone, and... hey, is that little bloke in cricket whites waving at you? THE RUMOUR MILL Leeds are preparing a move for Hertha Berlin striker Ali Daei, according to Teamtalk. They quote a source close to the German club who says: \"Leeds would be ready to buy Daei and Hertha would not hesitate in selling.\" Teamtalk also claims that Sunderland are about to table an \u00a38m bid for Aston Villa defender Ugo Ehiogu. NEWS IN BRIEF West Brom are to sign Tottenham winger Ruel Fox for \u00a3200,000. Fox, who initially moved to Albion on loan so he could play in the Bank Holiday games, said: \"Everything has been sorted out. I will be signing a two-year contract.\" Steve Claridge has signed a new three-year contract with Portsmouth, which will keep the striker at the club until he is 37. Norwich midfielder Chris Llewellyn has undergone an operation after suffering a fractured cheekbone in Monday's 1-0 defeat against Fulham. He is likely to be out for at least a couple of months. Lyon have signed Brazilian defender Edmilson - a former target of Arsenal - from Sao Paulo for \u00a37m. Diego Maradona has denied he is making a comeback after reports yesterday suggested he had provisionally signed for Argentine second division side All Boys. \"All Boys? No, I have nothing to do with them at all,\" he said. \"My future plans are the same as I said in July, which are staying here and continuing with my treatment. I am very happy in Cuba and I will stay in Cuba.\" TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV: Football Extra (3.25am) The title looks a bit like Football Pizza if you squint really hard.

      "body": "<p>First he cheats on her. Then he leaves her. Then Grant Bovey decides he's made a terrible mistake running off with Anthea Turner and talks Della into taking him back. But he has not been back long before Della discovers he is still carrying on with Anthea. There's another scene. Grant the Rat scuttles off again. Della resolves to put it all behind her - begin a new life, help her children pick up after this disaster and move on. But she has hardly had a chance to catch her breath before her children are swept off to feature as extras in Grant and Anthea's glitzy wedding. </p> <p>How did she feel to see her tragedy turned into a celebration? Didn't it hurt even more to know her children would be there to watch? Did she have any qualms about letting them attend, and if so, why didn't she put her foot down? And what was it like for the children? They must have been left feeling very confused. </p> <p>In this, at least, they have plenty of company. There is, after all, no \"right way\" to involve children in a second wedding. It used to be something movie stars did, badly. It's only very recently that people have begun to hope that it's something that should be done nicely. </p> <p>But how? That's still not clear yet. There are so many permutations, after all. It's one thing if the children in question are too little to know what's happening, and quite another if they're teenagers, and something else again if they're already adults. It matters how much time has passed since the divorce, and why the divorce happened, and how the old spouse and the new spouse get along. If I had no problem about my children attending their father's next wedding, it was because I liked the new wife. I would not have wanted to be there, although I do know of women who have gone along with their children to their ex's weddings. </p> <p>However, I also know a couple who went through a very bitter divorce but still managed to attend each other's second weddings several years later. They claim to be glad to have done so, and say the children are much more comfortable in their new families as a result. They admit there were awkward and painful moments, but it was better, they say, to have an extra pair of parents on hand to keep an eye on the children, who would otherwise have got lost in the throng. </p> <p>If you want to know how fast children can get lost in a shuffle, all you have to do is talk to adult survivors of the Second Wedding Experience. Here is a good one. A ten-year-old girl picks up the phone to call to her father. It is less than a year since the divorce. After talking at length about his tennis partners and a recent fishing trip, he says: \"I'd love to take a boat out when we're in the Bahamas, but it's a foolish man who takes a fishing rod on his honeymoon.\" This is how she finds out he is getting married that afternoon. When she asks him, \"Why didn't you tell me before?\" he says, \"I don't know, I guess it just slipped my mind.\" </p> <p>This girl is now in her 40s but she still flies off the handle when people give her important news \"in passing\". Would it have been better if her father had written her a formal note? Not necessarily. That's what this girl's mother did. She came home from school one day to find a long satin dress lying on her bed, along with a note saying: \"James and I are getting married at two o'clock next Saturday. You are going to be one of the bridesmaids and this is what I want you to wear.\" </p> <p>As upset as she was about being left out of her father's second wedding, she was even more upset by being forced to attend her mother's. In neither case, she believed, did the adults show any interest in her feelings - or even consider the idea that her feelings might be important. As far as they were concerned, a wedding was a private agreement between consenting adults. </p> <p>But traditional weddings have always involved children. They are public events in which the bride and the groom bring all the generations of their families together and formalise their social ties. As the psychologist, Janet Reibstein, points out, it's a ritual that marks the beginning of a new family. To exclude a child from this ritual is to tell her that she does not really belong. </p> <p>Of course, there are times when a parent truly does not want a child to belong to a new family. Della Bovey might not be particularly keen about the prospect of her children being part of a family that includes Anthea. If she had wanted to undermine this family in its infancy, she could have done so by preventing her children from attending the wedding. If she decided to let them go, it may have been because she thought that keeping them away would hurt the children far more than it could ever hurt their father. Maybe she has heard a story like this: an aggrieved mother bars her four-year-old son from attending his father's second wedding on the grounds that he is \"too young\". But every time the boy goes to visit his father and his new wife, he gets up at 6am and goes downstairs to watch the wedding video. Because his father refuses to speak against his mother, the boy still thinks he wasn't at the wedding because he wasn't wanted. </p> <p>Does this mean that children are better off attending second weddings? Not always. Horror stories I know include a five-year-old girl who did not make it to her father's wedding reception because he \"forgot\" her outside the registry office, and a seven-year-old boy who spent most of his father's wedding reception getting beaten up by his new step-brothers. He suffered in silence: another friend's 13-year-old daughter did not. Instead she got very drunk and told her father and everyone else in the room what a bastard he was. Her father later claimed that her mother had put her up to it. She hadn't, but it is common enough for a child to act up at a second wedding out of loyalty to the parent who \"got left behind\". Often enough, this parent will be very pleased to hear about it. </p> <p>But even if all the adults are well-behaved, things can still go wrong. For example, what if the children themselves say they don't want to attend? That's easy, says Reibstein. It probably means they don't want you to get married. They might say it's the shoes you're asking them to wear, or the number of hours they're going to have to sit in a room where they don't know anyone, but it's more likely to be that they don't like the look of the new stepmother, or are afraid that their new stepfather is going to rob them of their mother's affections. So the less time spent arguing about wedding outfits and wedding logistics, says Reibstein, the better the chances of addressing the root causes. And the more the children are involved in the planning of the wedding, the more likely they are to feel all right about it. </p> <p>Take the long view, she says. Instead of fixating on the day of the actual ceremony, think of the wedding as a ritual that begins months earlier, with the decision to remarry. The point of the ritual is to smooth over raw emotions, to have the new family working as a family by the time the ceremony begins. </p> <p>But don't get too anxious if you hit a few snags. This advice comes from a boy whose father's car got stuck in a snowdrift when the two of them were driving to the father's second wedding. When the car wouldn't budge, the boy, who was seven, had a crying jag. It was only in early adulthood that he found out his father took this as proof that the boy was deeply traumatised by his parents' divorce, and even more deeply ambivalent about the impending marriage. In fact, the boy was crying because he had a full bladder and was afraid he was going to wet his pants.</p> <p>The Family Through Divorce: How You Can Limit the Damage by Janet Reibstein and Roger Bamber Thorsons 8.99.</p>",

I begin to mourn the loss of each summer even before it's over, as the last days of the holiday seem to signify the end of an entire year rather than just another season. With the first day back at school for the autumn term my children move up a class and gain a year in a matter of moments. There are new teachers and pupils to get to know, tougher rules and new expectations to wrestle with, and the age they were a few weeks ago seems lost forever. </p> <p>When they are back at school it will be back to that relentless routine - up at seven, off to school at eight, home at four with homework, piano practice, supper and EastEnders before that final heave to get them into bed at a reasonable hour. There is so little time just to be together. Conversations are snatched, there's barely an hour to relax and have fun as a family and we're all so tired that tempers are easily frayed. Sometimes it feels as though we're just four individuals leading separate lives, linked by the same house and the children's immediate needs. I feel like a constant nag getting them through the day; they feel got at and frustrated with too little time to play. </p> <p>But in summer all that evaporates. My babies are my own again. They sleep in and pad round the house in their pyjamas. They eat more, play more together and fight less. Suddenly, the outside pressures are gone. There is more time for silliness, more space for laughter and their faces soften with rest, fresh air and sunshine. They find new and innovative ways to spend their time - mine spent the first two weeks of this year's holiday swapping bedrooms, a spur-of-the-moment decision made entirely by themselves. As an act of creative upheaval it was superb: it forced them - and us - to clean out their rooms, reassess their possessions, play with old friends and chuck out the broken and the useless. </p> <p>Summer is the only holiday when nothing much happens. The Christmas break is full of anxiety, too much money spent and family tensions raised to fever pitch. Easter may be a celebration of spring, but it's usually cold and too much chocolate is consumed. Summer, though, is the season when nagging can stop, we can find our equilibrium as a family again with everyone else away and the diary free of social commitment. Holidays in Cornwall, Wales or Suffolk have cemented that sense of family unity even further and created landmark memories - hide and seek in the dark, sea bathing in the rain, marathon sessions of Monopoly. </p> <p>A child's growth can almost be measured annually by the holiday snaps, which come back just as the shops start their back-to-school promotions. I have more pictures of my daughters in bathing suits eating ice cream on beaches during the summer months than at any other time of year. Each new picture resembles the last - blue sky, yellow sand, green fields and happy, sun-tanned faces. Only the child is slightly different, the younger one losing her curls, her chubby limbs, the elder one slowly developing the physique of a woman, with fuller lips and lengthening limbs. With each new set of photographs there is a sad reminder of how few summers like this there are ahead of us. </p> <p>The last few days of the summer holiday are a time of reflection. We tend to spend them alone without plans or friends to play with. Perhaps we will indulge ourselves with one final treat, or simply hunker down at home to prepare for what is to come, sharpening pencils, buying new gym shoes, sorting out the uniform. This year's \"back to school\" seems doubly significant as my 11-year-old starts secondary school and we will all have to navigate uncharted territory. New buildings, new teachers - by subject this time rather than form - a timetable, new friends to make and an entirely different route to school which she will soon have to, and want to, navigate alone. She is not just a year older, but embarking on a whole new phase of her life. Starting secondary school feels like the official beginning of her adolescence and the number of future happy summers together seem even more limited. </p> <p>Countless parents complain about the length of the summer holidays. They are no doubt looking forward to next week's new round of school runs, packed lunches and delegating responsibility for their children to the local education authority. It may be an unfashionable admission, but the school holidays are never long enough for me.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The girl squirms as her mother applies a moistened handkerchief to the corner of her mouth: \"Muuum,\" she hisses. But this is not a child on her way to kindergarten: this is a teenager en route to the first-ever Sugar Show, billed as the largest-ever gathering of teenage girls in Britain. Her mother dabs her carefully glossed mouth, the girl rolls her eyes under shiny lids and makes a bolt for the doors. She doesn't want to be held back from the serious business she came here for: this show is all about shopping, socialising, music, boys, fashion and beauty. </p> <p>Sugar is the country's biggest-selling teen magazine, and aims its brightly packaged mix of beauty, fashion, real-life stories and celebrity gossip at girls who fall between the jelly-and-ice-cream innocence of the younger child and the emancipated state of the older teenager. For the teenagers in the packed exhibition hall in Islington, north London, it's what the magazine is billing as \"the total ultimate day\", but the girls seem unsure what to do with it. Some of them drift around the shop-lined periphery in twos and threes, arms linked, dressed identically. When one stops to finger a diamante belt, the other has started towards the Tampax stand with its virtual make-over computers. </p> <p>Mahnie, 14, from London, has taken a break from a summer spent hanging out in Fulham (\"for the boys and the shopping\") to come to the show. She delivers her verdict: \"We looked around the shops. They're not that good. Kind of expensive,\" she pronounces before disappearing off to watch a band. </p> <p>Parents can be forgiven for drumming their fingers and thinking anxiously, \"Never mind the shops, what about the sex?\" Teenage magazines have a lurid history, but there is a distinct lack of explicit sexual content at the show. Instead, the brand names are out in force - the show is sponsored by Tommy Girl (Tommy Hilfiger's perfume), along with Tampax, Kodak, Schwarzkopf and Storm, the model agency. </p> <p>The landscape has certainly changed since the days when Peter Luff, a Tory MP, was prompted to table his periodical (protection of children) bill in 1996. Sugar had been on the market for two years then, and the level of public concern over the sexual content of the magazines was at a peak. Moral panic set in as newspaper article after newspaper article urged parents to examine their daughters' reading material. </p> <p>Few liked what they saw, and interpreted much of the content as incitement to early sexual experimentation. Luff, himself the parent of a magazine-reading daughter, filed a complaint with the Teenage Magazines Arbitration Panel, newly formed to monitor the content of the controversial publications.

      "bodyText": "The girl squirms as her mother applies a moistened handkerchief to the corner of her mouth: \"Muuum,\" she hisses. But this is not a child on her way to kindergarten: this is a teenager en route to the first-ever Sugar Show, billed as the largest-ever gathering of teenage girls in Britain. Her mother dabs her carefully glossed mouth, the girl rolls her eyes under shiny lids and makes a bolt for the doors. She doesn't want to be held back from the serious business she came here for: this show is all about shopping, socialising, music, boys, fashion and beauty. Sugar is the country's biggest-selling teen magazine, and aims its brightly packaged mix of beauty, fashion, real-life stories and celebrity gossip at girls who fall between the jelly-and-ice-cream innocence of the younger child and the emancipated state of the older teenager. For the teenagers in the packed exhibition hall in Islington, north London, it's what the magazine is billing as \"the total ultimate day\", but the girls seem unsure what to do with it. Some of them drift around the shop-lined periphery in twos and threes, arms linked, dressed identically. When one stops to finger a diamante belt, the other has started towards the Tampax stand with its virtual make-over computers. Mahnie, 14, from London, has taken a break from a summer spent hanging out in Fulham (\"for the boys and the shopping\") to come to the show. She delivers her verdict: \"We looked around the shops. They're not that good. Kind of expensive,\" she pronounces before disappearing off to watch a band. Parents can be forgiven for drumming their fingers and thinking anxiously, \"Never mind the shops, what about the sex?\" Teenage magazines have a lurid history, but there is a distinct lack of explicit sexual content at the show. Instead, the brand names are out in force - the show is sponsored by Tommy Girl (Tommy Hilfiger's perfume), along with Tampax, Kodak, Schwarzkopf and Storm, the model agency. The landscape has certainly changed since the days when Peter Luff, a Tory MP, was prompted to table his periodical (protection of children) bill in 1996. Sugar had been on the market for two years then, and the level of public concern over the sexual content of the magazines was at a peak. Moral panic set in as newspaper article after newspaper article urged parents to examine their daughters' reading material. Few liked what they saw, and interpreted much of the content as incitement to early sexual experimentation. Luff, himself the parent of a magazine-reading daughter, filed a complaint with the Teenage Magazines Arbitration Panel, newly formed to monitor the content of the controversial publications. The case centred on a Sugar real-life story (headline: \"I slept with 40 boys in three months\"). At the time, the story was not untypical - four years later, articles like it have all but disappeared from Sugar and its kind. Angela McRobbie, an academic expert on girls' magazines and professor of communications at Goldsmith's College, London, attributes the transition to self-regulation. \"I suspect some decision was made to pull back from the emphasis on sex and snogging and the question then is, what do we replace it with? The answer is an interest in products and consumer culture.\" With a weekly income of \u00a311.69, the average 13-year-old represents easy pickings for retailers.

      "body": "<p>They call it The Long Wait, even in An Explanation for Patients Undergoing Assisted Conception Treatment, a handbook dished out to IVF patients by the hospital. It's our own little barren person's nickname for the 14 days between embryo replacement and taking a pregnancy test. Two pinprick embryos have been put back into my womb. I have to wait a fortnight to see if they've implanted. The doctors agree that there's nothing I can do to influence the chances of my becoming pregnant. </p> <p>Even writing that word is difficult. In truth, it terrifies me. It is the absoluteness of the two possibilities - being pregnant or being sterile. Nothing about them coincides in any way. With each, I am staring at years ahead that could not be more different. So now, before that future unfolds, I'm leading two completely separate lives. And I have two lists, for my two possible futures. I have even drafted two final columns of this diary, with alternative endings. </p> <p>On the first list is everything the irretrievably sterile me is going to do. I have booked a break in east Africa, requiring jabs and malaria tablets that no pregnant woman could take. I have bought a new tightly fitting suit for the autumn, the skirt so short that it would ride up like a waistband over even a hint of belly - very Ally McBeal. </p> <p>And yet I continue to take folic acid, drink only in moderation and avoid raw red meat. For there is a second, secret list. I have stopped going to the gym. (\"Avoid strenuous exercise,\" says the handbook.) I have discovered that even the width of my waist is psychologically determined. When I believe in this list, I can't do up the top button of my new leather trousers. (When I believe in the first list, I can.) I have booked a week on the south coast with a friend, as an alternative to Africa. I'm prepared to let other people down in order that I am not let down; that is how selfish IVF can make you. </p> <p>But the most unspeakable difference between the two lists is the last item. The second list ends with buying a book about the stages of pregnancy. At the bottom of the first list is the decision on whether I try again. </p> <p>How many times should we do it? Support magazines for the infertile seem to specialise in arti cles from women who have been successful after the third, fourth or fifth time. Each one ends her testimony with a cheery \"Don't give up!\" Again and again, letters from readers, no longer barren, reassure those still in treatment that \"miracles do happen\". </p> <p>But they don't. Of all the ways to get pregnant, assisted conception is one in which miracles play no part. It's pure medical procedure. Reading these letters, even I find them cruel. Sometimes it must, surely, be better to surrender than to struggle on. There are practical reasons. Some studies have shown, if inconclusively, that there are risks of ovarian and breast cancer associated with fertility drugs. The more you take, the greater the risk. Then there's the small question of cost. Ironically, if you pay for your treatment - which nine out of 10 of us do - then you are more likely to repeat it. Once you've blown \u00a35,000 on three cycles, you're in such unrepayable debt that another few thousand seems like nothing. The addiction is that of a gambler. The biggest side effect of IVF is poverty. </p> <p>But there are also emotional ones. The daily drug routine, the frequent hospital visits, the counting of the days, becomes the skeleton around which the rest of your life is built. It shouldn't be like this, at least not for years, and definitely not for ever. At a recent meeting of fertility experts in Italy, Dr Elizabeth Kopitzke, of the University of Kentucky College of Medicine, presented research showing the toil of infertility treatment. \"As the momentum on patients' emotional and financial investment increases, it gets more and more difficult to make the decision to stop,\" she said. \"In our quest to help people, we can forget to help them to stop.\" Harbouring unrealistic hopes may be easier than giving up, but I'm convinced it's not as courageous. At some point you have to decide that this life, with all its unfulfilled longings, will just have to do. </p> <p>I bought the pregnancy test on the day of my embryo replacement. Each day, until I use it, is numbered six, seven, eight ... But for me, it will only be days, not years. The first list is always there to be lived, if the second is not. Nine, 10, 11 ... Which will it be? East Africa or Eastbourne?</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:leahwild@cswebmail.com\">leahwild@cswebmail.com</a></p>",

At a recent meeting of fertility experts in Italy, Dr Elizabeth Kopitzke, of the University of Kentucky College of Medicine, presented research showing the toil of infertility treatment. \"As the momentum on patients' emotional and financial investment increases, it gets more and more difficult to make the decision to stop,\" she said. \"In our quest to help people, we can forget to help them to stop.\" Harbouring unrealistic hopes may be easier than giving up, but I'm convinced it's not as courageous. At some point you have to decide that this life, with all its unfulfilled longings, will just have to do. I bought the pregnancy test on the day of my embryo replacement. Each day, until I use it, is numbered six, seven, eight ... But for me, it will only be days, not years. The first list is always there to be lived, if the second is not. Nine, 10, 11 ... Which will it be? East Africa or Eastbourne? leahwild@cswebmail.com",

Greg Watson, 21, had been walking with friends in Kensal Road shortly after 10pm on Monday when a man approached him and lashed out with a long-bladed knife. Detective Chief Inspector Guy Ferguson said Mr Watson, a delivery driver from Northolt, Middlesex, was an \"innocent young man who had been set upon for no reason\". Witnesses said Mr Watson could not have defended himself.

Mr Watson had only recently become a father. This is a tragedy, and our sympathy goes out to his family and friends.\" Mr Ferguson said the murder was the worst of several unrelated incidents which marred this year's bank holiday parade. A man aged 28, who was punched and kicked repeatedly by a gang of youths in Westbourne Park Road at 7.30pm on Monday, was on a life-support machine last night. The crush in Ladbroke Grove was responsible for an accident that left a Dutch woman aged 22 in a critical condition. She fractured her skull after railings gave way and she fell backwards into the well of a basement flat. Over the two days, 35 people were taken to hospital and 234 were treated by paramedics along the three-mile carnival route, including two police officers injured when boiling fat was thrown at them from a hot dog stall. Although the overall number of arrests, 129, was small for a carnival which attracted 1.5m visitors, it was a sharp rise on last year's 103. However, the number of reported crimes fell from 308 last year to 276.

It is the gap between people who have time on their hands and those whose lives are a constant frenzy. </p> <p>This \"time gap\" works in the opposite direction to the money gap. Typically, the (working) money-rich are time-poor. On the other hand, people with no job and precious little money tend to have all the time in the world, but nothing to fill those hours. Now there is a way of putting value on that spare time, using what are known as \"time banks\". </p> <p>This is not the same as the TimeBank currently being promoted by the BBC, among others, to stimulate volunteering. That only accepts deposits - hours of volunteering. It does not allow withdrawals, so it is more time \"sink\" than bank. Volunteering is fine, but it is even better to be able to \"spend\" the unpaid hours which have been banked. </p> <p>In Watford, people are swapping errands for housework, letter-writing for woodwork. In Lewisham, south London, doctors are \"prescribing\" time and in Gloucestershire, there is a county-wide scheme linking nine time banks. </p> <p>This innovative idea is simple. Like many others it originated in the US, and has been copied in Japan. After 10 years, there are now said to be about 1,000 schemes running in those two countries. In Brooklyn, New York, bereavement counselling is available for time dollars, and a Baltimore housing estate allows tenants to pay rent in time. The Japanese government has backed a time currency which translates as \"ticket for caring relationship\". </p> <p>It works rather like a baby-sitting circle. You do three hours for one member, then you can claim three hours back, either from that member or any other. The notion was lauded recently in the upper house by Lord Dahrendorf, who described it as an advanced kind of barter. </p> <p>There are similarities with \"Lets\" and other local currency schemes. But with time banks, everybody is equal. There is no question of ne- gotiating a price, or being at a disadvantage if what you have to offer is not as highly valued as what others can sell. </p> <p>David Boyle, an advocate of time banks and author of the book Funny Money, says the central thrust is about giving value to people who have no conventional wealth and no marketable skills. \"Funny money, in this context, treats people's strengths, not their problems. It sees them as equals, which changes the relationship. The bottom line is that there is unmeasured surplus capacity in society, which is not seen because it has no monetary value. By using this kind of monetary system you can plug in to that spare capacity and to unmet human needs.\" </p> <p>Surplus capacity comes in many forms. It is the hours which somebody might be able to spend offering companionship. But it is also the computers discarded by businesses in favour of the latest models. Time banks in the US offer members the chance to buy such computers with their banked hours. </p> <p>Boyle, working with the New Economics Foundation, aims to establish a London-wide network. Currently there are only two schemes in the capital, but he predicts there will be 30-40 in a couple of years. \"The idea is applicable everywhere,\" he says. \"The idea of time as a parallel money system is quite powerful.\" </p> <p> It can become more powerful with technology. Computer software helps make the \"accounting\" easy. Smart cards could dramatically expand the possibilities for \"spending\" banked hours, at sports centres, for example. In Minneapolis, in the US, time can be loaded on a credit card and spent in the country's largest shopping mall. </p> <p>The enthusiasm of local and central government agencies for time banks raises the suspicion, however, that this is just another way for government to avoid spending money on necessary services. How much better for the budget to get people to do things for nothing, rather than have to shell out salaries to people to provide the service. </p> <p>Watford council addresses this issue head on. \"Time Swap is not an excuse for budget cutting or getting services on the cheap,\" its information leaflet says. But it also argues that \"social services needs are so great that resources must be mustered from every possible quarter\". </p> <p>Watford emphasises the value of time banks in rebuilding neighbourhood spirit. \"An added benefit of a Time Swap project is that it can help to build a cohesive, stable, self- perpetuating community of self-help. Time Swap can turn strangers into friends and neighbours into extended families,\" the council eulogises. </p> <p>Boyle believes government should be interested in time banks because of the potential for attacking social exclusion. \"This is really about rebuilding communities, relationship by relationship,\" he says. \"The kind of networks which allow people to support each other have disappeared in many parts of the developed world.\" </p> <p>It may be sad that people need formal systems to induce them to use spare time to help those in need. But if time banks help give back self- respect to people who have been feeling useless and unwanted by society, and provide much-needed support to those who would otherwise stay in need, they must be beneficial. </p> <p>It remains true that time can't buy you love, any more than money can. But time banks suggest that it can buy you companionship, support and services which you might otherwise be unable to afford.</p> <p><strong>Alternative medicine </strong></p> <p>Richard Byng heard about the time bank concept from its inventor, the American, Edgar Cahn. Byng, a GP, decided it could help address some of the problems of patients at his south London practice at Rushey Green, who appeared to need something other than medicine to restore their self-esteem and make them feel engaged. </p> <p>\"This is an area where a lot of people feel isolated,\" he says. \"There are a lot of bedsits and short-term lets, and people who have lived round here a long time who are feeling isolated and scared.\"</p> <p>A pilot scheme was introduced last year and the full version went live this spring. Currently it is operating with about 40 active members and the practice expects numbers to increase to about 150. The idea is that it should be enjoyable and reciprocal. Tasks on offer include story-telling, escorting people unable to go out alone, fishing, odd jobs, doing errands, shopping, babysitting and visiting housebound people.</p> <p>Participation is aided by a co-ordinator paid for jointly by the King's Fund health institute and the Carnegie Foundation. \"That means we can be proactive in getting people involved, rather than just letting people sit on a list,\" Byng says.</p> <p>Other GPs are watching the experiment sceptically, he admits, but he believes it will help people who may be suffering depression or feelings of inadequacy. \"Volunteering gives people confidence. It says: 'You're worth something'. That is the focus - showing people they have value.\"</p>",

But if time banks help give back self- respect to people who have been feeling useless and unwanted by society, and provide much-needed support to those who would otherwise stay in need, they must be beneficial. It remains true that time can't buy you love, any more than money can. But time banks suggest that it can buy you companionship, support and services which you might otherwise be unable to afford. Alternative medicine Richard Byng heard about the time bank concept from its inventor, the American, Edgar Cahn. Byng, a GP, decided it could help address some of the problems of patients at his south London practice at Rushey Green, who appeared to need something other than medicine to restore their self-esteem and make them feel engaged. \"This is an area where a lot of people feel isolated,\" he says. \"There are a lot of bedsits and short-term lets, and people who have lived round here a long time who are feeling isolated and scared.\" A pilot scheme was introduced last year and the full version went live this spring. Currently it is operating with about 40 active members and the practice expects numbers to increase to about 150. The idea is that it should be enjoyable and reciprocal. Tasks on offer include story-telling, escorting people unable to go out alone, fishing, odd jobs, doing errands, shopping, babysitting and visiting housebound people. Participation is aided by a co-ordinator paid for jointly by the King's Fund health institute and the Carnegie Foundation. \"That means we can be proactive in getting people involved, rather than just letting people sit on a list,\" Byng says. Other GPs are watching the experiment sceptically, he admits, but he believes it will help people who may be suffering depression or feelings of inadequacy. \"Volunteering gives people confidence. It says: 'You're worth something'. That is the focus - showing people they have value.\"",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>London theatre director Max Stafford-Clark first met Andrea Dunbar in 1980 in Haworth, that unusually twee part of West Yorkshire which was once home to the Bront\u00ebs. Like Charlotte and Emily, Andrea was a female writer whose work caused a stir in its day. Comparisons end there. Dunbar's natural territory was the Buttershaw council estate in Bradford. </p> <p>\"She was staying at a refuge for battered women when I tracked her down,\" Stafford-Clark recalls. \"Her social worker just happened to live in Haworth.\" A long way from the Royal Court in Sloane Square, SW1, where Stafford-Clark was responsible for unearthing new writing talent. Dunbar didn't seem too bothered about being unearthed. But she did, rather grudgingly, agree to follow the posh bloke with the double-barrelled name back to London, and attend rehearsals of a play called The Arbor, which she had written at 17. </p> <p>She would go on to write Rita, Sue and Bob Too - shocking, even by the Royal Court's standards, in its portrayal of life in what has become known as \"the underclass\". It was not an expression that Dunbar would have recognised. She just lived in the underclass. And died there. Three years after the play had been made into a feature film, she collapsed in the very familiar surroundings of her local pub. A short, brutal life, which had spawned a rare talent, had been extinguished at 28. </p> <p>\"Most working-class writers become middle class after their first success,\" says Stafford-Clark. \"But she was never interested in escaping.\" That's why, he believes, hers was an authentic voice worth rediscovering. Twenty years on from that first meeting, he has taken six actors from his Out of Joint theatre company and gone back to the estates of West Yorkshire to find out what's changed since the early years of Thatcherism. In the autumn, they're planning to stage a revival of Rita, Sue and Bob Too, coupled with a new play called A State Affair, which should reflect three weeks of listening to residents, drug counsellors, care workers, policemen and others. </p> <p>The man responsible for transforming their words into a coherent, compelling drama is Robin Soans, an actor who lives in Kilburn, north-west London. He has worked for the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company, as well as the Royal Court. When I catch up with him in Bradford, he is scribbling notes in the cramped office of Agape House, a stone-built villa which an estate agent might describe as \"compact\". </p> <p>Perhaps it just seems small because there are so many people in it. Apart from a project worker, part-time volunteers and a kitchen full of cooks, there are a dozen young men in various stages of rehabilitation from serious drug habits. They are the lucky ones. Many more are clamouring to get in. \"We can only take 12 at a time,\" says Sue King, who set up the unit with a loan from Barclays and some funding from her local Free Church, where her husband James is a pastor. </p> <p>The Kings have a business selling burglar alarms - much in demand on the nearby Thorpe Edge estate. Robberies to fund drug habits are not exactly uncommon. Soans and Stafford-Clark did plenty of reading (notably the work of Nick Davies and Paul Danziger) before heading north, so they had some idea of what to expect. \"But the thing that has shocked me,\" Soans admits, \"is the sheer scale of it. A policeman told me that he knew of only one person who could finance his habit.\" </p> <p>It's not that the drugs are expensive. Indeed, one of the key changes since the early 80s is a drastic reduction in the price of heroin, which has served to make it accessible to far greater numbers. \"We're not looking back to some golden age,\" Soans insists. \"Many of the old factory jobs round here had gone by 1982. But no structure has been put in place to replace that pattern of the working day. At the same time, the other structures which held society have gradually disappeared - youth clubs, boys' brigades, swimming pools, even chip shops and post offices.\" Sue King chips in: \"And don't forget the break-up of the family unit.\" </p> <p>\"Absolutely,\" Soans goes on. \"Every story starts with terrible abuse - sexual, physical or emotional. No wonder heroin has gone through this area like a forest fire. It offered temporary relief from pain. One woman told me it was 'like heaven on a piece of foil'.\" </p> <p>Jack would recognise that description. He knows all about the buzz of heroin. And the pain it causes. Tucking into a bowl of pasta on the terrace behind Agape House, he is wearing a tracksuit and looking like a fit young man of 25 should do. </p> <p>\"When I came in here, I looked as though I'd come from Belsen,\" he confides between mouthfuls. He had, in fact, come from Leeds, where he once had a \u00a3250-a-week job as a machine operator and a girlfriend who was a catalogue model. His addiction to heroin cost him both, and he bitterly regrets it now he can think straight. \"When you're on smack, you don't think about anyone else,\" he says. \"All that's on your mind is when that dealer's going to switch on [his mobile] and where you're going to get the money to pay for it.\" </p> <p>Listening carefully is young actor Gary Whitaker, who was brought up on the Buttershaw estate and went to school with Andrea Dunbar's brother. Although he has no part in the revival of Andrea's best-known play, he has offered his services as \"tourist guide\" to Stafford-Clark. \"It was a bit eerie going back,\" he concedes. \"There were so many boarded-up houses, but I think that's because they're doing a lot of work there.\" </p> <p>In fact, Buttershaw and two adjoining estates have been the recipients of \u00a331m from the single regeneration budget. \"There are a lot of positive things going on,\" adds Whitaker, who is keen not to appear critical of the place he came from and where some old mates still live. </p> <p>Although he has appeared in some cutting-edge work on the London stage, his face is better known up here from television advertisements. \"Are you the Kwik-Fit fitter?\" asks a resident, emerging from the pool room at Agape House. Whitaker grins gamely and admits that he is. After that welcome shaft of light relief, we set off to a drop-in centre called the Listening Zone, run by more volunteers - \"rays of hope,\" according to Stafford-Clark who seems surprised and moved by how many selfless people devote their lives to battling against seemingly insurmountable odds in their own communities. </p> <p>The zone is in Greystoke Avenue, but this derelict stretch of shuttered shops might as well be called Desolation Row. Across the road, it's a different story. Neat new semis in local stone are set in an undulating landscape with open fields behind them. Hope and despair rub shoulders here. </p> <p>Actress Jane Wood sits on a crumbling wall outside the derelict shops and tells me about two little girls who used to play with her daughter in London. Both later became addicted to heroin. One is dead and the other has just had her child taken away. Wood blinks away the tears and says: \"Even if we can't change anything by putting on this play, we might just raise awareness of what's going on.\" </p> <p>Those who choose to go and see it will be confronted by two bleak views of estate life, separated by 20 years. And still no happy ending in sight.</p> <p><strong>A talent shining through the gloom </strong></p> <p>When Rita, Sue and Bob Too first hit the London stage, it was famously described as \"Thatcher's Britain with its knickers down\". In a notorious first scene, two schoolgirls take turns to have sex with a married man in the back of his car. </p> <p>In an unfortunate piece of timing, the later film version of the play was released just as Bradford council was launching a promotional campaign for the city under the slogan Bouncing Back With Bradford. Among reviews best described as mixed, the Daily Express called the film \"unmitigated abusive gloom\".</p> <p>In the ensuing controversy, playwright Andrea Dunbar wrote in the Yorkshire Post: \"This is life, the facts are there. The guardians of our morals can stand back and gasp, but these things go on - maybe not in their circles, but certainly in mine. Young girls do get involved with married men. They do have affairs and abortions, and nobody gives a second thought to it.\"</p> <p>The film, though, was resented by many older residents of the Buttershaw estate. And Dunbar did suffer a backlash. One of her daughters, Lorraine, has blamed the movie for her mother's death, and Rob Ritchie, who had acted as Dunbar's informal agent, has said: \"I think the film... was the point at which whatever dreams she might have had about being a writer collapsed. It unleashed all those problems for her family and the community that she was living in.\"</p> <p>Dunbar always maintained she was an unexceptional talent. \"There's people in Buttershaw a lot more clever than I could ever be,\" she once told the Bradford Telegraph &amp; Argus.</p> <p>\u0095 Rita, Sue and Bob Too and A State Affair begin a national tour at the Liverpool Everyman on October 19. The plays will go to Oxford, Colchester, Eastbourne, Plymouth, Coventry, Manchester, Blackpool, Cam- bridge and the Soho Theatre, London (December 5-16 and December 27 to January 13).</p>",

The zone is in Greystoke Avenue, but this derelict stretch of shuttered shops might as well be called Desolation Row. Across the road, it's a different story. Neat new semis in local stone are set in an undulating landscape with open fields behind them. Hope and despair rub shoulders here. Actress Jane Wood sits on a crumbling wall outside the derelict shops and tells me about two little girls who used to play with her daughter in London. Both later became addicted to heroin. One is dead and the other has just had her child taken away. Wood blinks away the tears and says: \"Even if we can't change anything by putting on this play, we might just raise awareness of what's going on.\" Those who choose to go and see it will be confronted by two bleak views of estate life, separated by 20 years. And still no happy ending in sight. A talent shining through the gloom When Rita, Sue and Bob Too first hit the London stage, it was famously described as \"Thatcher's Britain with its knickers down\". In a notorious first scene, two schoolgirls take turns to have sex with a married man in the back of his car. In an unfortunate piece of timing, the later film version of the play was released just as Bradford council was launching a promotional campaign for the city under the slogan Bouncing Back With Bradford. Among reviews best described as mixed, the Daily Express called the film \"unmitigated abusive gloom\". In the ensuing controversy, playwright Andrea Dunbar wrote in the Yorkshire Post: \"This is life, the facts are there. The guardians of our morals can stand back and gasp, but these things go on - maybe not in their circles, but certainly in mine. Young girls do get involved with married men. They do have affairs and abortions, and nobody gives a second thought to it.\" The film, though, was resented by many older residents of the Buttershaw estate. And Dunbar did suffer a backlash. One of her daughters, Lorraine, has blamed the movie for her mother's death, and Rob Ritchie, who had acted as Dunbar's informal agent, has said: \"I think the film... was the point at which whatever dreams she might have had about being a writer collapsed. It unleashed all those problems for her family and the community that she was living in.\" Dunbar always maintained she was an unexceptional talent. \"There's people in Buttershaw a lot more clever than I could ever be,\" she once told the Bradford Telegraph &amp; Argus. \u0095 Rita, Sue and Bob Too and A State Affair begin a national tour at the Liverpool Everyman on October 19. The plays will go to Oxford, Colchester, Eastbourne, Plymouth, Coventry, Manchester, Blackpool, Cam- bridge and the Soho Theatre, London (December 5-16 and December 27 to January 13).",

When you open it, he tells you in no uncertain terms he is going to kill you. What do you do? </p> <p>What I did, shaking, was to go back inside, close the door and call a friend. Through the floorboards, I could clearly hear my neighbour ranting about what he was going to do to me. It wasn't pleasant. My insubstantial door was hardly going to be an obstacle. Without hesitation, my friend told me to get the hell out. </p> <p>My neighbour had moved in four months before. From day one his behaviour had been paranoid and drunken. Up all night raging; arguing with himself; bragging to himself; sometimes, with a friend, crashing around and smashing the furniture. Unsurprisingly, knocks on his door and pleas and demands for him to have consideration for others had little or no effect. </p> <p>Having fled my flat, I went straight to the nearest police station. A woman in uniform took a report and suggested I stay with friends. A few days later I was interviewed by CID. My neighbour, I discovered, had been in prison for a long stretch. The officers were not allowed to disclose what for, but the point was clear - you don't do that sort of time for a parking offence. I faced a difficult choice: the police could go round and \"give him a talking to\", or they could arrest and charge him, but he would be released within 12 hours. Either way, he would know I had reported him. And when I next bumped into him on the stairs, his feelings towards me were not likely to have improved. </p> <p>The CID offered a third alternative: the officers could write a letter to the housing department, explaining the situation, and requesting action be taken. I opted for that, but nothing happened. The CID blamed the housing department for inaction, and vice versa. Interviewed by my housing officer, I told him that having witnessed my neighbour's erratic and paranoid behaviour first hand over the past few months, I was convinced he was suffering a mental illness. The officer said he had no information to that effect. </p> <p>I contacted the local social services to see if they could help, wondering if my neighbour might be a \"care in the community\" patient. His flat had been fully furnished for him, everything brand new - something social services generally do not do for single, young, unemployed males. I felt sure there had to be someone keeping an eye on his behaviour. Social services told me that rules of confidentiality meant they could not disclose information about whether or not someone was a client. No advice was forthcoming about where or how I might find help. </p> <p>The housing department had warned my neighbour about his behaviour before. But there were procedures to follow and the best I was offered was replacing my door with something more solid, and writing to my neighbour to warn him that if he offended again, he would be served with a notice seeking possession. After several weeks staying with friends, I decided to move back. </p> <p>There was no improvement. Two days later, the housing department served the notice. My neighbour raged, smashed furniture, slammed doors and ranted about how he had shot someone before and would have no qualms about \"doing\" me. He charged into the street and hurled threats at strangers. All very scary stuff. I didn't want to be there and I didn't fancy an encounter. </p> <p>I called the police, explained the situation and asked if they could put a car outside for a couple of minutes, just to make sure I escaped. But they were having a busy night and when I called an hour later, I was told to sit tight. In the end, my nerves were just too frazzled to listen a minute longer to the murderous tirades. During a lull, I slipped out and got away. That was two months ago. Apart from occasional fleeting visits to pick up clothes, I have scarcely returned. I contacted my local councillors and MP to try to draw attention to the situation and get something done. At the suggestion of a friend, I went to the Zito Trust, the charity which campaigns to highlight inadequacies of care in the community and provides support for people who have suffered as a result. </p> <p>From the beginning I have kept a log of all the incidents where my neighbour's noisy or threatening behaviour has disrupted my life - almost 50 over the first four months. The council's legal department has studied the list for its eviction case. Just recently, my housing officer informed me that his investigations revealed my neighbour had been receiving treatment for a diagnosed psychiatric illness. It transpires that he not only has a parole officer, but also a social worker and a psychiatric nurse. It turned out that none of them knew what my neighbour had been up to. But how would they? Did they expect him to volunteer the information himself? </p> <p> It is now widely accepted that people suffering mental illness should, wherever possible, be treated in the community. But for this to work, they need to be well supported and supervised; otherwise they, and the community in which they live, will suffer. Though my neighbour has shown no inclination to change his behaviour, the housing department may have to abandon its eviction case because social services would like him to stay put and see if they can \"make it work\". </p> <p>The care professionals were oblivious to what was going on. It clearly wasn't working. And how can it now? Intervening after he has harassed, threatened and intimidated for eight months is way too late. Instead of being cared for in the community, my neighbour has been allowed to run amok and become a threatening presence. The way he is now perceived in the street can hardly be helping his paranoia.

As the net's infrastructure gets stronger, viral marketing gets easier and the rewards for those who can do it properly, get bigger. \"The internet was designed to be a system for individuals to exchange ideas. If you look at the bulk of traffic on the net, most of it is community: People talking to each other. The most popular application on the net is e-mail.\" OgilvyOne has just launched a viral marketing campaign for Felix cat food using an email of a downloadable cartoon cat named Felix. Virtual Felix will initially be mailed to a small group of cat lovers, who are urged to email him on to friends. Sent as an attachment to PC users, the programme sees Felix playing around on the computer desktop. It contains a link to the Felix website, where users can register to receive extra toys and other accessories for their cartoon cat. This enables the company to record detailed information about cat lovers for direct marketing purposes. Felix's European marketing manager, Calum Macrae, said: \" The internet is not designed to be a broadcast medium. Using it as such is an expensive and often futile process. The net is a many-to-many medium. Viral communications exploit the fact that the strongest influence will always be word of mouth. This is a way of adding structure to word of mouth. \"",

      "bodyText": "Mohamed Al Fayed has announced legal action against the United States government in a bid to obtain \"secret\" documents concerning the death of Diana, Princess of Wales and his son, Dodi. The Harrods owner also called on the American people to lobby President Bill Clinton to release Diana and Dodi security files. On the eve of the third anniversary of the fatal Paris car crash, Mr Fayed repeated his claim that the Princess and his son were murdered. In a video-recording played at a Washington DC news conference today, he said: \"Federal agencies of the United States of America possess documents which may provide vital information as to the cause of the deaths of Diana, Princess of Wales and my son Dodi. \"They refuse to release many of them on the basis that they would jeopardise national security. \"I believe they are withholding some of the documents at the request of the British Secret Service who cannot afford to let the truth be known.\" Mr Al Fayed said he would have liked to have been in Washington in person but the anniversary of the death of his son and Diana was \"too painful for me to speak in public\". He called on Americans to write to their Congressional representatives and President Clinton to ask them to release documents held by US agencies such as the Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, and Defence and Justice departments. Diana and Dodi died when a Mercedes driven an employee of Mr Al Fayed, Henri Paul, crashed in the Alma tunnel in Paris on August 31, 1997. French police found that Paul, deputy head of security at the Paris Ritz, who was also killed in the crash, had been drinking heavily and was speeding. But Mr Fayed has refused to accept the French findings, repeatedly alleging that British security services engineered the crash. In today's statement he claimed that US intelligence agencies, using the most sophisticated satellite systems, spied on Diana, monitored many of her conversations and apparently passed the information to MI6. He also accused the US Department of Justice of failing to fully investigate and prosecute alleged fraudsters who attempted to extort \u00a312 million from him by offering for sale alleged CIA documents. A CIA spokesman told Sky News that he \"emphasised\" that suggestions of CIA involvement in the crash were \"ludicrous\". Mohamed Al Fayed's website",

      "body": "<b>quizzer</b> <br> Why does Britain need an e-envoy? Isn't the point of the internet that it develops without regard to governments and national boundaries? <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> Let me start with quizzer's question about why we need an e-envoy at all. Tony Blair felt that the internet was at the heart of so many different policies that he needed someone who could take an overview of what was going on and what the Government needed to do. We work with Departments like the Department of Trade and Industry on the market and business framework, with Department for Education on skills and so on, and we are driving the plans to get government itself online. </p> <p>I think there's a job that needs doing here - we're certainly not short of work :-)</p> <p><b>rmarriott1</b><br> Mr Allen, how does it feel to be appointed e-envoy by a Government which is doing everything it can to destroy the UK's future in the developing new e-commerce economy? The following measures are doing real and lasting damage to the UK's competitiveness in the new e-business world: </p> <p>1. IR35 - this vindictive tax measure is driving UK IT consultants out of the country in droves. I myself start a contract in New Jersey in October, leaving the UK precisely because of IR35. My skills - distributed database systems and the integration of large databases with the web. </p> <p>2. NICs on share options - bad policy which is inhibiting investment by high tech. companies. Real examples - Veritas has halved its investment in the UK because of this measure and Cisco is rumoured to have diverted its investment plans to Eire for the same reason. </p> <p>3. RIP Bill - it is simply stupid for the UK Government to attempt to go it alone in internet regulation - far better to wait for international agreement. As a consequence of RIP, four UK based ISPs have threatened to move offshore. </p> <p>Mr Allen, I suggest you resign in protest at the Government making your job impossible.</p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> rmarriott1 - as you can imagine I get more email about those three topics than almost anything else. </p> <p>Let me take the RIP Bill first. The Government has amended the law as it went through Parliament, in response to all the points that were made. That's the essence of our Parliamentary system. I don't believe the Act is a threat to e-commerce in the UK. The Home Office has made clear that the burden on ISPs will not be excessive and the Treasury has agreed to additional funding. And the provisions on keys have been modified to make it clear that what's wanted is plain text. We do need to make sure we have laws in place to deal with paedophiles, terrorists etc. </p> <p>I'll answer on share options and IR 35 in a moment.</p> <p><b> rmarriott1</b> Obviously we need to make sure we have laws in place to deal with paedophiles, terrorists etc. My point is that internet as a global phenomenon can only be regulated at the supra-national level. Either this should be done through GATT or the WTO, or through a new body set up for the purpose. The reason ISPs are threatening to leave the UK is not because of the cost, but because of the regulatory disadvantage UK only action places them in. </p> <p><b>RealAlien</b> Mr Allan, In your response to the question re: the RIP bill, the bill itself shows how out of touch the Govt. is with IT and the Internet in general. </p> <p>Even the US has said that the powers in the RIP bill are excessive. Taking as examples our European partners, France and others have relaxed their laws, while the UK has greatly increased, are they then wrong or being complacent? In the global market, companies can and are going to countries that are seen to be reducing regulatory burdens. Sadly, the UK is increasing while our EU partners and the rest of the world are reducing theirs. The powers are not needed, and anyone with knowledge of the Internet will know that paedophiles, terrorists and criminals will not be deterred or even caught by the additional powers. It is merely an amateur attempt to regulate. </p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> rmarriott1 and RealAlien - Most other countries have or are planning provisions to require ISPs to enable emails to be intercepted: we are not alone on this. Witness the interest in the US in the FBI's use of the so-called Carnivore system to plug into ISPs and intercept email traffic. The Dutch have passed legislation on this in very similar terms to our own.</p> <p><b>JosephSW</b><br> Dear Alex, </p> <p>I run a small IT consultancy (I am not a disguised employee), and have a real opportunity to join a new e-Commerce company in this country. </p> <p>The new company has been approached by a thriving marketing company to act as its e-Commerce partner. However, because of the new IR35 measures my existing business will not be able to afford to fund the initial startup costs... the company profit is being taxed at 52% before it can be re-invested for growth. </p> <p>Is it clear to you now that IR35 is killing new e-Commerce ventures in Britain?</p> <p><b>jrharding</b><br></p> <p>Mr Allen The danger of a _genuine_ business falling foul of IR35 is real and the penalties are horrendous (personal bankruptcy and even imprisonment) How are _genuine_ small business's supposed thrive in this environment?</p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> I promised to come back on IR35 and share options, though don't expect easy solutions. </p> <p>On IR35, the Inland Revenue have made it clear that if someone meets the tests for self-employment, then they won't be affected. I know some contractor groups have sent in model contracts which seem to meet that test, though others seem to feel this won't help them. We'll have to monitor how that works out in practice. It's not a question of attacking entrepreneurship: there was some genuine abuse by people avoiding employees income tax and NICs by becoming contractors even though the reality was that they were in the same position as before. The difficult bit is stopping that without hitting people who have genuinely set up businesses.</p> <p> <b>AlexAllan1</b><br> On share options, the Treasury made some changes in the last Budget. In many circumstances we now have very similar effective rates of taxation to the US. But I know there are areas where firms feel the new rules still discourage firms from using share options as a way of giving all their employees a stake in the success of the company. Stephen Timms, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, led a review of this and I'm sure will want to monitor how the new arrangements are working.</p> <p><b>rmarriott1</b><br> Mr Allen, thank you for your response on the IR35 issue, but you must realise that this is a dog's breakfast of a tax change. If there were real abuses to be dealt with, proper and genuine consultation with representatives of the businesses affected could have framed workable regulations. IR35 is arbitrary, unfair and discriminatory. Affected businesses are left in a state of dire uncertainty since the IR in their wisdom will not vet contracts until they have been signed. If a contract is affected by IR35 it is impossible to action it profitably. Mr Allen, are you in any way independent, or do you have to slavishly endorse every silly thing the Government does?</p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> On IR35, I'll make sure the Treasury see the comments posted here, and will discuss with them the arrangements for monitoring the impact. </p> <p><b>Nsedgwick</b><br> Alex, I think the IR35 comments cannot be expressed loudly enough. The new IR35 legislation is causing huge uncertainty and doing real damage to entrepreneurial Web/e-commerce/IT businesses such as mine. The PCG now has over 11,000 members who stand opposed to these draconian measures. In reality the number of legitimate businesses damaged by IR35 is much greater.</p> <p>Something must be done and quickly! NS. </p> <p><b>SysOut</b><br> You have used the arguments of paedophiles and terrorists to interfere with our rights and our privacy - those are the arguments of dictators - it is totally unacceptable. </p> <p>Were you to do the same with people's post - people receiving letters with envelopes which had been opened, you know very well what the reaction would be. </p> <p>This is immoral and disgusting - until now the speciality of police states. </p> <p>The fact that others (usa) do it, does not make it right or better - where is the moral backbone we expect? </p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> Sysout - I'm sure I won't convince you, but the law for some time **has** allowed the police or other agencies to get a warrant to intercept letters or phone calls. They can only do this when they have evidence that someone is engaged in crimes such as I mentioned. What the RIP Act does is extend this to other forms of communication.</p> <p><b>SysOut</b><br> Thanks Alex for your answer - I will remain, as I hope others will, vigilant of government activity in matters of data protection and privacy.. </p> <p><b>ALargeElk</b> A quick flick through http://www.parliament.uk shows that less than half of MPs can be contacted by email and only about 80 have their own homepages. Do you feel that 'to improve the democratic process', educating those at the top would be a good place to start?</p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> ALargeElk asked about MPs email addresses and home pages. I have had discussions with the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology and with the Hansard Society about this. They are keen to encourage more MPs to use the internet and are looking at ways to help them get online. Many MPs are interested but worried about how they would handle what they fear could be a flood of email. There is quite a lot that can be done to make handling emails easier, so I hope we will start to see more MPs publishing their email addresses. I was in Rutland yesterday and the (admittedly small!) Council told me that every one of them published email addresses on their web site.</p> <p><b>dsi</b><br> What do think about using the internet as a tool for those with disabilities, enabling them to get access to information they might not otherwise be able to get?</p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> dsi - there's certainly a lot that can be and is being done to help people with disabilities take advantage of all the opportunities offered by the internet. The Government's web site guidelines have been drawn up in consultation with the RNIB and others so as to make sure that Government sites are as accessible as possible to everyone. </p> <p>It's a great tool for communication, as you say.</p> <p><b>fmk</b><br> alex - do you believe your task is being needlessly undermined by daft reporting of minor security hitches which, if they happened in the real world, wouldn't merit a para in your local paper, but because they happen in the e-world, they are front page news (ref barclays this week)?</p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> fmk - I agree that far too much is made of some of these incidents, and it does all serve to make people fearful of doing transactions online. Clearly, firms need to have proper security procedures in place so that people can be confident their personal data won't be misused. But it's far more dangerous giving your credit card to a waiter in Soho than dealing with a reputable web site using SSL for example. </p> <p><b>Paulos</b><br> How and by when will the voting process change for the electorate. If not via the internet, is there not scope for voting via the national lottery terminals - it strikes me that apathy at the ballot box could be re-addressed in this day and age. What are you recommending to your boss? </p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> Paulos - I agree we need to think imaginatively about how we can make voting easier, so that more people will participate. I was in Australia for their last election, and they have compulsory voting. I don't see that going down well here, but what was striking was the way they made voting so much easier - people could vote anywhere in their State rather than just at a single polling station. Various experiments were made during the recent local elections here and we need to analyse what worked best. There' quite a lot more to do - a rolling electoral register where you can change your registration details online is one example of a service I believe would make things easier.</p> <p><b>meethoss</b><br> At this moment in time, it is very expensive to hire a company to bring E-Commerce in to your site, and very complicated to set it up yourself. Will you be providing any sort of solution to this? </p> <p>E-Commerce is a vital part of trading and many companies are not taking advantage of it due to the complications, expenses and lack of knowledge on the subject. </p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> meethoss - it needn't be that expensive for small firms to add e-commerce to their sites. I guess I'd better not endorse individual companies, but I visited a firm in Yorkshire recently who had a really easy system for setting up and hosting e-commerce sites at a reasonable price. Local Business Links should be able to provide advice on what firms in any region are doing that.</p> <p><b>meethoss</b><br> In regard to your statement about voting on-line, I would like to point out the fact that the Internet is not the safest environment and is susceptible to attacks from \"crackers\" from all over the World. How would you ensure that the election was totally secure and that it could not be changed to influence votes for certain parties?</p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> meethoss - we'd clearly need to make absolutely sure about the security of online voting before we enabled that. I believe the technologies are or will be there, but they also need to command public acceptance. The Electoral Commission would need to be closely involved to rule out any possibility of fraud or manipulation.</p> <p><b>jrharding</b><br> Mr Allen </p> <p>Do you feel that the government is depending far too much on large consultancies for advice on IT. When its obvious they have vested interests in directing the government in directions which will be profitable for themselves?</p> <p><b>AlexAllan1</b><br> jrharding - we certainly want to make sure we get consultancy advice from a wide range of firms. The new Office of Government Commerce has a role to play in this. I'm very conscious of your point: a small consultancy firm recently explained to me that the bureaucracy and number of meetings involved in tendering for Government contracts made it impossible for them to afford to do so. We want to tap into innovative thinking in this area.</p> <p> <b>AlexAllan1</b><br> Thanks - I've got to sign off now. I've found it interesting and I'm sorry if I haven't been able to answer all the questions. </p> <p>You are welcome to email me on e-envoy@open.gov.uk - without interception!</p>",

Taking as examples our European partners, France and others have relaxed their laws, while the UK has greatly increased, are they then wrong or being complacent? In the global market, companies can and are going to countries that are seen to be reducing regulatory burdens. Sadly, the UK is increasing while our EU partners and the rest of the world are reducing theirs. The powers are not needed, and anyone with knowledge of the Internet will know that paedophiles, terrorists and criminals will not be deterred or even caught by the additional powers. It is merely an amateur attempt to regulate. AlexAllan1 rmarriott1 and RealAlien - Most other countries have or are planning provisions to require ISPs to enable emails to be intercepted: we are not alone on this. Witness the interest in the US in the FBI's use of the so-called Carnivore system to plug into ISPs and intercept email traffic. The Dutch have passed legislation on this in very similar terms to our own. JosephSW Dear Alex, I run a small IT consultancy (I am not a disguised employee), and have a real opportunity to join a new e-Commerce company in this country. The new company has been approached by a thriving marketing company to act as its e-Commerce partner. However, because of the new IR35 measures my existing business will not be able to afford to fund the initial startup costs... the company profit is being taxed at 52% before it can be re-invested for growth. Is it clear to you now that IR35 is killing new e-Commerce ventures in Britain? jrharding Mr Allen The danger of a _genuine_ business falling foul of IR35 is real and the penalties are horrendous (personal bankruptcy and even imprisonment) How are _genuine_ small business's supposed thrive in this environment? AlexAllan1 I promised to come back on IR35 and share options, though don't expect easy solutions. On IR35, the Inland Revenue have made it clear that if someone meets the tests for self-employment, then they won't be affected. I know some contractor groups have sent in model contracts which seem to meet that test, though others seem to feel this won't help them. We'll have to monitor how that works out in practice. It's not a question of attacking entrepreneurship: there was some genuine abuse by people avoiding employees income tax and NICs by becoming contractors even though the reality was that they were in the same position as before. The difficult bit is stopping that without hitting people who have genuinely set up businesses. AlexAllan1 On share options, the Treasury made some changes in the last Budget. In many circumstances we now have very similar effective rates of taxation to the US. But I know there are areas where firms feel the new rules still discourage firms from using share options as a way of giving all their employees a stake in the success of the company. Stephen Timms, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, led a review of this and I'm sure will want to monitor how the new arrangements are working. rmarriott1 Mr Allen, thank you for your response on the IR35 issue, but you must realise that this is a dog's breakfast of a tax change. If there were real abuses to be dealt with, proper and genuine consultation with representatives of the businesses affected could have framed workable regulations. IR35 is arbitrary, unfair and discriminatory. Affected businesses are left in a state of dire uncertainty since the IR in their wisdom will not vet contracts until they have been signed. If a contract is affected by IR35 it is impossible to action it profitably. Mr Allen, are you in any way independent, or do you have to slavishly endorse every silly thing the Government does? AlexAllan1 On IR35, I'll make sure the Treasury see the comments posted here, and will discuss with them the arrangements for monitoring the impact. Nsedgwick Alex, I think the IR35 comments cannot be expressed loudly enough. The new IR35 legislation is causing huge uncertainty and doing real damage to entrepreneurial Web/e-commerce/IT businesses such as mine. The PCG now has over 11,000 members who stand opposed to these draconian measures. In reality the number of legitimate businesses damaged by IR35 is much greater. Something must be done and quickly! NS. SysOut You have used the arguments of paedophiles and terrorists to interfere with our rights and our privacy - those are the arguments of dictators - it is totally unacceptable. Were you to do the same with people's post - people receiving letters with envelopes which had been opened, you know very well what the reaction would be. This is immoral and disgusting - until now the speciality of police states. The fact that others (usa) do it, does not make it right or better - where is the moral backbone we expect? AlexAllan1 Sysout - I'm sure I won't convince you, but the law for some time **has** allowed the police or other agencies to get a warrant to intercept letters or phone calls. They can only do this when they have evidence that someone is engaged in crimes such as I mentioned. What the RIP Act does is extend this to other forms of communication. SysOut Thanks Alex for your answer - I will remain, as I hope others will, vigilant of government activity in matters of data protection and privacy.. ALargeElk A quick flick through http://www.parliament.uk shows that less than half of MPs can be contacted by email and only about 80 have their own homepages. Do you feel that 'to improve the democratic process', educating those at the top would be a good place to start? AlexAllan1 ALargeElk asked about MPs email addresses and home pages. I have had discussions with the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology and with the Hansard Society about this. They are keen to encourage more MPs to use the internet and are looking at ways to help them get online. Many MPs are interested but worried about how they would handle what they fear could be a flood of email. There is quite a lot that can be done to make handling emails easier, so I hope we will start to see more MPs publishing their email addresses. I was in Rutland yesterday and the (admittedly small!) Council told me that every one of them published email addresses on their web site. dsi What do think about using the internet as a tool for those with disabilities, enabling them to get access to information they might not otherwise be able to get? AlexAllan1 dsi - there's certainly a lot that can be and is being done to help people with disabilities take advantage of all the opportunities offered by the internet. The Government's web site guidelines have been drawn up in consultation with the RNIB and others so as to make sure that Government sites are as accessible as possible to everyone. It's a great tool for communication, as you say. fmk alex - do you believe your task is being needlessly undermined by daft reporting of minor security hitches which, if they happened in the real world, wouldn't merit a para in your local paper, but because they happen in the e-world, they are front page news (ref barclays this week)? AlexAllan1 fmk - I agree that far too much is made of some of these incidents, and it does all serve to make people fearful of doing transactions online. Clearly, firms need to have proper security procedures in place so that people can be confident their personal data won't be misused. But it's far more dangerous giving your credit card to a waiter in Soho than dealing with a reputable web site using SSL for example. Paulos How and by when will the voting process change for the electorate. If not via the internet, is there not scope for voting via the national lottery terminals - it strikes me that apathy at the ballot box could be re-addressed in this day and age. What are you recommending to your boss? AlexAllan1 Paulos - I agree we need to think imaginatively about how we can make voting easier, so that more people will participate. I was in Australia for their last election, and they have compulsory voting. I don't see that going down well here, but what was striking was the way they made voting so much easier - people could vote anywhere in their State rather than just at a single polling station. Various experiments were made during the recent local elections here and we need to analyse what worked best. There' quite a lot more to do - a rolling electoral register where you can change your registration details online is one example of a service I believe would make things easier. meethoss At this moment in time, it is very expensive to hire a company to bring E-Commerce in to your site, and very complicated to set it up yourself. Will you be providing any sort of solution to this? E-Commerce is a vital part of trading and many companies are not taking advantage of it due to the complications, expenses and lack of knowledge on the subject. AlexAllan1 meethoss - it needn't be that expensive for small firms to add e-commerce to their sites. I guess I'd better not endorse individual companies, but I visited a firm in Yorkshire recently who had a really easy system for setting up and hosting e-commerce sites at a reasonable price. Local Business Links should be able to provide advice on what firms in any region are doing that. meethoss In regard to your statement about voting on-line, I would like to point out the fact that the Internet is not the safest environment and is susceptible to attacks from \"crackers\" from all over the World. How would you ensure that the election was totally secure and that it could not be changed to influence votes for certain parties? AlexAllan1 meethoss - we'd clearly need to make absolutely sure about the security of online voting before we enabled that. I believe the technologies are or will be there, but they also need to command public acceptance. The Electoral Commission would need to be closely involved to rule out any possibility of fraud or manipulation. jrharding Mr Allen Do you feel that the government is depending far too much on large consultancies for advice on IT. When its obvious they have vested interests in directing the government in directions which will be profitable for themselves? AlexAllan1 jrharding - we certainly want to make sure we get consultancy advice from a wide range of firms. The new Office of Government Commerce has a role to play in this. I'm very conscious of your point: a small consultancy firm recently explained to me that the bureaucracy and number of meetings involved in tendering for Government contracts made it impossible for them to afford to do so. We want to tap into innovative thinking in this area. AlexAllan1 Thanks - I've got to sign off now. I've found it interesting and I'm sorry if I haven't been able to answer all the questions. You are welcome to email me on e-envoy@open.gov.uk - without interception!",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<b>So the police are having trouble hiring?</b> <br> Police numbers are falling - down by 1,678 last year - causing a double-headed problem for home secretary Jack Straw. First, he has promised repeatedly that police numbers would rise; instead the number of officers has slipped from 127,158 in England and Wales in April 1997, to 124,418 today. Second, levels of politically sensitive types of crime, such as violent crime, are rising sharply. So the decline in police numbers has become a political hot potato. <p><b>Why are numbers falling? </b><br> For all sorts of reasons. One factor is the devolved structure of Britain's police forces. By law the home secretary cannot determine the number of officers each force employs and some chief constables have chosen to spend any spare cash on new technology rather than extra manpower. Another cause has been a squeeze on police budgets - until recently some forces have had to sack officers rather than recruit them. This problem was partly solved by the comprehensive spending review, which provided extra funds for recruitment. But the most significant cause of the problem seems to be the fact that people simply aren't as keen to join the police as they once were.</p> <p><b>Why is this? </b><br> Money has something to do with it - police salaries have not kept pace with private-sector ones, particularly in the south-east, where the recruitment crisis is at its most serious. Officers can no longer afford to live in some of the areas they police. The reputation of the police has taken a knock, too - partly as a result of the report into the Stephen Lawrence affair and revelations about police corruption, but also through the way the police are portrayed on television. Ministers complain that programmes such as The Bill are simplistic and misleading.</p> <p><b>So what are they doing about it? </b><br> Launching an advertising campaign, for one thing, under the title Could You? Police. These are designed to show police officers as heroic public servants rather than dubious stick-wielders. The TV ads feature real-life heroes such as Falklands veteran Simon Weston and footballer John Barnes describing how despite their own success, they still admire the work done by the police. </p> <p><b>But the army's had ads for years.

      "bodyText": "So the police are having trouble hiring? Police numbers are falling - down by 1,678 last year - causing a double-headed problem for home secretary Jack Straw. First, he has promised repeatedly that police numbers would rise; instead the number of officers has slipped from 127,158 in England and Wales in April 1997, to 124,418 today. Second, levels of politically sensitive types of crime, such as violent crime, are rising sharply. So the decline in police numbers has become a political hot potato. Why are numbers falling? For all sorts of reasons. One factor is the devolved structure of Britain's police forces. By law the home secretary cannot determine the number of officers each force employs and some chief constables have chosen to spend any spare cash on new technology rather than extra manpower. Another cause has been a squeeze on police budgets - until recently some forces have had to sack officers rather than recruit them. This problem was partly solved by the comprehensive spending review, which provided extra funds for recruitment. But the most significant cause of the problem seems to be the fact that people simply aren't as keen to join the police as they once were. Why is this? Money has something to do with it - police salaries have not kept pace with private-sector ones, particularly in the south-east, where the recruitment crisis is at its most serious. Officers can no longer afford to live in some of the areas they police. The reputation of the police has taken a knock, too - partly as a result of the report into the Stephen Lawrence affair and revelations about police corruption, but also through the way the police are portrayed on television. Ministers complain that programmes such as The Bill are simplistic and misleading. So what are they doing about it? Launching an advertising campaign, for one thing, under the title Could You? Police. These are designed to show police officers as heroic public servants rather than dubious stick-wielders. The TV ads feature real-life heroes such as Falklands veteran Simon Weston and footballer John Barnes describing how despite their own success, they still admire the work done by the police. But the army's had ads for years. Are they really the answer? Probably not - but they make it clear that the government has recognised the problem. The real solution probably lies in spending more money. Already the allowance given to officers working in London has been increased, leading to a 28% increase in applications to the Metropolitan police. The home secretary has also set aside cash to recruit 9,000 new officers across England. And that if that doesn't work? It's been suggested that the police might recruit the next generation of bobbies from abroad - leading to a rash of speculation about a culture clash between unarmed British officers and their gun-toting European colleagues. In fact the police would only be adopting a practice which has long helped staff other public-service professions, such as medicine, and there seems to be little chance that the streets will be filled with French flics anytime soon.

Participants in the \u00a336m Accelerator Media fund include Channel 5, radio group GWR, Guardian Newspapers, publisher of the Guardian and the Observer, Jazz FM and Kelvin MacKenzie's Wireless Group. The investment fund has raised some \u00a320m in cash and a further \u00a316m in advertising space in return for equity in Accelerator. The investors are expected to float Accelerator on the stock market within 12 to 18 months to raise further cash. An important aim of the fund is to reduce the \"cash burn\" of marketing costs in the early months of a company's development. \"There's been an awful lot of money spent on marketing by start-ups - and perhaps not all of it wisely due to the goldrush mentality,\" said Philip McDannell, the former managing director of Chrysalis Group, who is running Accelerator. \"With this business we have huge leverage among the media companies who are involved and we have experts who can give terrific advice.\" Other senior management figures include Alan Brydon, former media director of advertising agency AMV BBDO, and Charles McIntyre, the financier who helped Mr MacKenzie raise the cash for TalkRadio - now renamed the Wireless Group. The cash element has been provided by Gold-Zack, a financial services group which is listed on the Frankfurt stock exchange. Accelerator will target companies which are at second stage financing instead of raw start-ups. This is not the first time a media company has offered advertising space in return for equity in internet start-ups, but Accelerator claims to be the first in which a range of firms have joined together. The Accelerator investors own poster sites, TV channels, radio and press operations. Mr McDanell said the market for fledgling new media and technology companies had reached sensible levels after the mania of last year and the first three months of 2000. \"There is still the potential for high returns, although not necessarily of the fantastic kind we were looking at the start of the year. \"This is a realistic time to invest,\" he said. \"People are not asking for crazy money in return for a small percentage in their company, and the whole approach to business has become more mature.\" The Accelerator fund will target both business to business and the less fashionable business to consumer markets but will require some demonstrable revenues streams before investing.

      "bodyText": "The SDLP leader, John Hume, is to resign his Northern Ireland assembly seat, the party confirmed today. The Nobel peace prize laureate will remain as leader of the party, MP and MEP. SDLP officials said Mr Hume had decided to step down as an assemblyman for Foyle in the near future to reduce his workload. \"In recent times, John has had to cut down his workload. He will continue as MP and MEP and there is no question whatsoever of him stepping down as party leader,\" an SDLP spokesman said. Mr Hume's decision came a year after he received hospital treatment for a ruptured intestine. West Belfast MLA Dr Joe Hendron expressed \"sadness\" at Mr Hume's decision. Dr Hendron, who also served with Mr Hume in the Commons as West Belfast MP between 1992 and 1997, revealed that the SDLP leader had informed assembly colleagues of his decision at a meeting at Stormont yesterday. \"I am saddened that John has had to cut down on his workload for health reasons. He will be sorely missed on the assembly benches but will still be at our meetings in Stormont as party leader and will be remaining as an MP and MEP,\" the West Belfast assemblyman said. \"The SDLP is very proud of John's achievements as a party leader.

When Barks took on Donald, the duck was thin with a long beak. It was Barks who made him more cartoon-like - rounder, with a much fatter beak - and who defined his comic character.</p> <p>Barks felt that everyone could identify with Donald Duck: \"He is everything, he is everybody; he makes the same mistakes that we all make.

In fact, it was Walt Disney himself who suggested Barks move to the story department because they needed good gag writers more than animators. It was while there that he wrote the Donald Duck short, Modern Inventions; later he invented Duckburg and extended Donald's family to include his three young nephews Huey, Dewey and Louie.</p> <p>In 1939, Barks wrote a typescript story, Pieces of Eight, in which Mickey, Donald and Goofy run a tavern in a small, New England village. It is a fine tale of an errant parrot, hidden treasure, cross-dressing and a sea chase. It never got made, but in 1941 Oscar Lebeck of Western Publishing, the firm that published Disney's comics and stories every month, saw in it the material for something to follow up his firm's successful comic book, Mickey Mouse and the Phantom Blot. The script was adapted for Donald and his nephews, and Barks, with Jack Hannah, created the comic book Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold (1942). After this, Barks left Disney to concentrate on writing and illustrating comic books full time.</p> <p>It is a paradox of our times that these comic books, once available on every American news-stand and often the only means by which audiences could keep up with the characters whose screen releases were tightly controlled, are now wrapped in Cellophane and kept below glass because of the sums they fetch.

After leaving home at 15, he worked as a rancher, logger, then railroad repairman. He had loved drawing as a boy, and by the early 1930s he was selling cartoons to the Calgary Eye-Opener.</p> <p>His work brought him to the Disney studios in 1935, a year after Donald had first appeared in The Little Wise Hen. Barks's eye for a gag and a story quickly had him out of the ruck of animators, and he worked on Snow White, Bambi and Fantasia as well as three-dozen Donald shorts, including Donald's Nephews (1938) and Mr Duck Steps Out (1940).</p> <p>After moving to work full-time on the comic book series for Western Publishing, he created such characters as McDuck, the burgling Beagle Boys, and Gyro Gearloose, who is aided by a walking lightbulb.</p> <p>Barks - with as much a Looney Tunes spirit as a Disney one - found inspiration in everything. Steeped in the world of Saturday-morning cinema, his work has had a distinct influence on American artists and film-makers, even though none of them would have known his name at the time; anonymity is the cartoonist's lot - a necessary mask if characters are to take flight.</p> <p>Barks retired from working full-time on cartoons in the mid-60s and turned to a new art - painting oils of his cartoon figures. Over the years he found an extraordinary market for them. Barks brought all the vim of a Picasso to these oils and prints which command high prices. To some tastes they are gaudy, not in the same spirit as the original story frames, but if you had $250,000 to spare then Barks might have been persuaded to conjure up a scene in which McDuck is seen in his money-feathered nest.

Speaking in Gravesend, Kent, the Conservative party leader said adoption must be made easier for childless couples.

Mr Hague told the Catholic Children's Society's familymakers section - which prepares traumatised children for adoption or for long-term fostering - how he would make adoption easier for childless couples. He said it was wrong that children in care sometimes had to wait three years before they could be adopted, despite there being a long list of responsible, stable, loving families who would take them on. \"Conservatives want to make sure that the first consideration in adoption cases is the protection of children's interests at the heart of loving families,\" he said. \"We want to tear up the politically correct rulebook that exploits children for the sake of an irrelevant social agenda.

A document outlining the Conservatives' strategy described as a \"scandal\" the three years it can take for an adoption to go through. Every child in care for 12 months should have an adoption plan and youngsters should have access to charities, church organisations or another family. The Conservatives would also separate local authorities' ownership of care homes from their social services responsibilities. And they would abolish the government's home detention curfew scheme, preventing child sex offenders from being released into the community before they have served their sentences. The use of mandatory life sentences for first and second-time sex offenders would be increased. The government had said \"many of the right things\" on these issues, Mr Hague said, but it was letting young people down by failing to act now. But Mr Hague admitted that the Tories' much heralded \"tax guarantee\", the promise to reduce taxes as a proportion of national income, would not be featured in the party's draft manifesto. The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, said the Tories could not be trusted. \"Whatever guarantees William Hague tries to run away from this autumn, he can't run away from the fact that the Tories remain committed to cutting \u00a316bn worth of British public services,\" he said.

The document was agreed by Labour at its national policy forum and will be published at this year's party conference. It argues that euro-membership would bring four big advantages to Britain - price transparency across the EU; the elimination of the exchange rate differences which are harming industry; participation in a zone of economic stability; and an end to transaction costs for travellers. <p><b>But these are all points that have been made before. Why do they matter now?</b><br> Because the document is evidence that the government may be shifting its position.

The government's policy is still to \"prepare and decide\" before putting the issue of British membership to a referendum. Gordon Brown sets great store by the five \"tests\" he has devised to determine whether the time is right to join and will not advocate membership until these criteria have been met. Behind the scenes things are rather more complex.

That said, neither the chancellor nor the foreign secretary think Britain should join the single currency immediately, and neither of them wants to rule it out all altogether. </p> <p><b>So they really agree?</b><br> Not quite. Robin Cook and Gordon Brown might agree about the broad sweep of policy towards the euro, but they certainly disagree when it comes to the matter of tone. The chancellor's early enthusiasm for the single currency, in 1997 and 1998, has been replaced by a cautious neutrality. In contrast, the foreign secretary - always a pro-European - has become openly keen on joining. A draft of a speech he gave earlier this year, for instance, included a promise that the government \"would not let Britain lose by staying out\" - words that the chancellor would be unlikely to use. </p> <p><b>Is the government split on the issue, then?</b><br> To a degree. Apart from the foreign secretary, two other leading ministers, trade secretary Stephen Byers and Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson, would like the government to be more openly enthusiastic about the euro. But the real issue is not a fundamental split between pro-Europeans and anti-Europeans, but a concern on the part of pro-Europeans that the single currency is not an issue on which the government should or can remain neutral. </p> <p><b>What about Tony Blair?</b><br> The prime minister's main concern has been to maintain a united front. The last thing he wants is a public split between his chancellor and his foreign secretary as the election approaches. Until now his main concern has been to avoid the single currency becoming an election issue. That might allow William Hague to exploit public disquiet about the subject. However, his leaked memo and the recent policy document suggest he may have come down on the side of the pro-Europeans.

      "body": "<p>The most extraordinary arrogance underpinned the comments of the spokesman for the National Beef Association, who yesterday sought to minimise the significance of the latest findings in the BSE scandal by questioning the conduct of research in what he described as \"an obscure area\". It was precisely that kind of arrogance within farming that in the first place produced this shameful outrage that has already killed 70 people and humiliated an entire industry. </p> <p>The suggestion by Robert Foster, speaking on behalf of the country's troubled beef farmers, was that the incidence of BSE in cows is now diminishing, that the number of cases of new variant CJD in humans might therefore also be expected to reduce in number in future and therefore that we can all get back to our roast beef and Yorkshires and relax in the comfortable knowledge that these issues are being handled by people with a greater expertise than ourselves. Butchers can get back to such business as they have been bequeathed by the deadly combination of supermarkets and food poisoning, the scientists can cheerfully forget about these unnecessarily alarming matters and perhaps occupy themselves with something more socially useful, while the environmental lobby can get back in its box. </p> <p>Yet it was the arrogant pursuit of profit to the exclusion of all other considerations which led an over-confident beef industry to feed ground-up dead sheep to herbivorous cows and cause this chaos. It was an arrogant complacency within farming which accepted for years the existence of scrapie in sheep without bothering to worry about the potential for this disease to cross into other animals. It hadn't happened - so why should it ? The incidence of human CJD caught from scrapie in sheep was known, but very rare. So, arguably, that particular complacency was justified - at least until the greedy farmers tried to maximise their profits by so unthinkingly causing the contamination of the entire beef industry and feeding diseased sheep carcasses to cows. </p> <p>Now when it is revealed as a result of serious scientific study by the government-funded Medical Research Council that it is possible that a highly infectious variant of BSE could exist in another form in other species - sheep and pigs and poultry - someone speaking on behalf of the beef industry has the temerity to suggest that this is an \"obscure\" area for inquiry. It will not seem obscure to those relatives of innocent victims who have already died. In due course, it won't seem obscure either to any of that unknown number who may still be carrying the infection. And it doesn't seem obscure to me, a consumer. I want to know about these things. </p> <p>My interest is no different to that of any other consumer, except that in the late 1980s I contracted food poisoning when pregnant as a result, presumably, of inefficient - or at least inappropriate - farming practices. In our case it was listeria monocytogenes and, mercifully, my baby and I survived. At the time, no one had heard of listeria, including the midwives in the maternity hospital. I watched my diet with great care and attention as any pregnant woman would. Although things had been a bit touch and go at the time of the birth - an emergency caesarean, intensive care, isolation wards, three weeks in hospital - I still hadn't realised quite how serious it all was until I had a visit from an official at the Public Health Laboratories. A man with a briefcase in due course arrived, exuding official assurances, to ask me about my diet. The baby had been born, three weeks early, in June; the official came to call in September and it was then that he wanted to know all that I had eaten in May. He wanted to know everything. If I had sausages, where would I have bought them? Did I wash my lettuces? Did I like cheese? What brand of butter? </p> <p> My point in rehearsing this personal experience is to relate the extent to which it heightened my awareness of how close, how casual, had been my brush with serious food poisoning. There had been 19 cases of the same strain of listeria that year - none of us ever having heard of it, of course - and a number of them had died, the man with the briefcase revealed. It made me very conscious indeed of the extent to which it was possible to poison oneself unknowingly. </p> <p>So it was with great interest that I recall attending a press conference held jointly by the Department of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture on February 27 1989, at which it was announced that the government had ordered that ground-up bits of the spinal column of cows along with some other less appealing bits of the animal were in future to be banned not only from baby food, but from the entire food chain. That press conference was a revelation. I was ignorant enough to be astonished to learn that baby food was not made up of the finest minced rump steak - but that was completely incidental. The event was dominated by a series of question to officials about the chances of \"mad cow disease\", as we had just learned to call it, crossing into the human food chain. The message was, by and large, to forget it. </p> <p>Time and again the officials present were challenged. They insisted that such a cross-infection was something about which we should not be concerned - and that, in any case, if there was to be a problem we would not know about it for 10 or 12 years. And so it proved. John MacGregor, the agriculture minister at the time, took pride then, as he still does (or is he demonstrating a measure of relief?) in the fact that he was prepared to go further than the official advice which was limited to merely restricting dubious beef bits in baby food. MacGregor extended it to all food despite the reservations of some of his officials at his readiness to go beyond scientific advice. And all praise to him. </p> <p>But there was a complacency at large then, as there is still. There was great nervousness about the alarm that had been provoked in the public mind about the safety of our food. There is still. There are various points to be made about publishing the interim results of research of the kind we heard about yesterday. It is, for example, almost certainly unhelpful to the farming industry. Well, bad luck on them. Regrettably that industry has forfeited any right to take decisions involving public health on our behalf. Isn't it actually more likely to be a source of public confidence rather than anything else that scientists are still monitoring what is going on in agriculture as a result of the industry's past mistakes and mismanagement ? </p> <p>And so what if publication, unaccompanied by appropriate advice, is alarmist, as was also suggested yesterday. As the chairman of the Science and Technology Select Committee, Michael Clarke said: \"If the whole country has to go vegetarian, then for goodness sake say so.\" That is one response. But the most important thing is that we, as consumers, should be alerted to what is going on and given the the information that enables us to take our own decisions, unfettered by other people's commercial concerns. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Only citizens of the UK, the Republic of Ireland and the Commonwealth are currently allowed to join the police and the move would need new legislation, which is being mulled over by the home secretary, Jack Straw. The proposal to enlist officers from outside the UK comes as the government launches Britain's first ever national police recruitment campaign devised with the help of M&amp;C Saatchi. The \"Could You? Police\" campaign will run over three years and is being backed by a number of celebrities, including Simon Weston, John Barnes and Patsy Palmer. Advertisements will run on national TV, newspapers, radio and in cinemas to provide forces in England and Wales with high-quality recruits to help them fill the 9,000 extra police places being offered over the next three years. Since the 1997 general election, the number of police officers has dropped from 127,158 to 124,418. Throughout the 43 forces, 5,391 officers joined in 1998-99, but 6,104 left, a net loss of 713. The Metropolitan police have been the worst hit, and in a bid to stem the exodus Met officers are now paid around \u00a36,000 a year more than elsewhere, a fact that rankles home counties forces. Essex police have resorted to TV advertising during breaks in programmes like The Bill and Prime Suspect 5 to attract viewers interested in law and order. Mr Straw said the two main purposes of the advertising campaign were to improve the numbers and calibre of those seeking to join the police and to emphasise the importance of what was involved in being an officer. \"We need a modern, extremely capable and highly regarded police service,\" Mr Straw said. \"That is why we are attaching so much importance to the new police recruitment campaign.

      "bodyText": "Lawyers for David and Victoria Beckham yesterday failed to persuade the publishers of a new biography of the couple to withdraw controversial passages during behind-the-scenes negotiations at the high court in London. Returning to the courtroom, Michael Tugendhat QC, for the Beckhams, said a 60,000 word manuscript by Princess Diana's biographer Andrew Morton, entitled Posh and Becks, contained about 2,500 words based on information provided by the couple's former bodyguard, Mark Niblett, 40, who stopped working for them in May. The couple were seeking an interim injunction to stop publication pending a trial to establish whether the disputed passages constituted a breach of confidence. Mr Tugendhat said evidence given by Mr Morton showed Mr Niblett \"acted or attempted to act in disregard of his plain duties of confidentiality by offering a very large amount of material to Mr Morton, most of which he did not use. \"This is a very bad case of disloyalty and breach of confi dentiality on the part of a former employee.\" Geoffrey Robertson QC, for Mr Morton and his publishers Michael O'Mara Books, said material in the book was either not significantly confidential or was already in the public domain. Urging Mr Justice Evans-Lombe to read beyond disputed chapters four and nine when he examined the manuscript, Mr Robertson said: \"You can't judge a book by its cover or by bits and pieces of it.\" He added the case should be considered in light of the imminent introduction of the Human Rights Act, section 12 of which provides for freedom of speech. Mr Robertson also suggested it would be proper to consider the \"self-generated publicity\" that Posh Spice Victoria and Manchester United and England player David had pursued. Mr Justice Evans-Lombe heard the case had some urgency as Mr Morton's book, if published, was likely to be in competition with David Beckham's autobiography, My World, to be published by Hodder Headline next month. The hearing was adjourned until today.",

Over a period of 35 years and in 14 books, he made a sustained and major contribution to the theory of how our belief systems relate both to one another and to everyday experience and practice. His best-known work is on Kant, known as a minor classic and still read by students.</p> <p>Born in Ostrava, in what is now the Czech Republic, Stephan K\u00f6rner received a doctorate in law from Charles University in Prague, practised law briefly, and served in the Czech cavalry before coming to England as a refugee in 1939. He took a doctorate in philosophy at Cambridge University, where he studied under Richard Braithwaite, and attended Wittgenstein's famous classes. After taking his doctorate, he fought in France.</p> <p>He joined the philosophy department at Bristol in 1946 and was appointed professor and head of department in 1952. Then, in 1955, he published two quite different books: Conceptual Thinking, written for specialists, and Kant, one of the first post-war books to attempt to make the ideas of that difficult philosopher accessible to English-speaking students. In 1957, he edited a highly significant volume, Observation and Interpretation, arising from a conference in Bristol which had brought together many leading physicists and philosophers of science.</p> <p>The activity of this period foreshadows much of his subsequent work. The central topic of Conceptual Thinking (1955) is of great importance, and K\u00f6rner's treatment of that topic was in advance of its time. He draws a fundamental distinction between exact and inexact concepts. Exact concepts, such as the mathematical concept of a triangle, have \"sharp boundaries\"; inexact concepts, in contrast, always have \"borderline cases\", and are typically exemplified by concepts applying to sense experience (concepts like red or tree) and legal concepts (conspiracy or fraud). But although such concepts are \"inexact\" in this precise sense, that does not mean that we need abandon the attempt to be clear and precise in our reasoning about them.</p> <p>K\u00f6rner's preoccupation with the articulation of our system of concepts led him in his book on Kant to emphasise those features of Kant's project that were directly related to his own. In particular, he saw the centre of Kant's philosophy to be his attempt to derive the possibility of intelligible experience from \"built in\" features of our conceptual system.</p> <p>But K\u00f6rner's central objection to Kant's metaphysics was that Kant held there to be only one conceptual framework for the rational understanding of experience, whereas K\u00f6rner held that, in fact, there can be a number of competing conceptual frameworks.</p> <p>Very much the same issues provide the central theme of his textbook on the Philosophy of Mathematics, which focuses on the metaphysical question of how applied mathematics is possible. For K\u00f6rner, the exact concepts of pure mathematics arise from the idealisation of those inexact concepts which can be applied to experience. Thus using a stretched string to draw a circle leads to the definition of the ideal Euclidian circle which, of course, can't be drawn exactly. Once we are safely within the ideal world of pure mathematics we can travel wherever exact reasoning leads us; the problem remains, however, why, when we drop back to the world of experience, our mathematical discoveries turn into correct predictions.</p> <p>To his students, K\u00f6rner made even the first steps in philosophy seem to be the most important. But he did not follow philosophical fashion, and this perhaps restricted his immediate influence.</p> <p>Stephan was a strikingly handsome man capable of displaying elaborate and formal Central European manners. But what is more to be recalled is the quality of his often droll humour, and his sweetness and generosity. His devotion to his wife, Ditti, was one of the most endearing things about him.

The correspondence of many a famous author reveals that it has always been the task of the publisher's operative to get the spelling right.

Great minds think of higher matters. </p> <p>So anyone hostile to David Blunkett's latest directive about the importance of spelling has any number of precedents to prove that eloquence and expressiveness are not to be fettered to minute arrangements of letters. Many famous writers would have faltered in front of the list of 600 crucial words that the minister of education has just issued to secondary schools.

Blunkett's department has decreed that these words should be known by the end of the first year at secondary school. </p> <p>This looks like a symbolic statement, as well as an effort to have teenagers who can manage \"Wednesday\" and \"February\". In the recent past, attention to spelling has not seemed an important aspect of the teaching of English. Many university teachers can testify that it is possible for a student to have wobbly spelling and yet achieve A grades in English GCSEs and A-levels. Even more strikingly, such an intelligent bungler often has no idea that he or she is getting it wrong. It sometimes seems as if a series of English teachers have not wanted to quibble over the merely trivial errors of the cleverest pupil in the class. </p> <p>I remember this suspicion being confirmed when I was asked by a newspaper to look at the essays of a candidate who had just received an A in GCSE English literature and was attempting a supposedly \"harder\" O-level practical criticism exam from the 70s. In fact, to the paper's disappointment, she had no problem with the old-style exam. Her answers showed admirable literary sensitivity and employed an impressive vocabulary - definitely A grade. Yet they were also littered with spelling mistakes. </p> <p>This might be evidence for the arguments of the anti-pedants. There are indeed highly intelligent English students - articulate, widely read, responsive to literary language - who are poor spellers. Of course, if they do not discover this until university, the whole thing becomes rather embarrassing: \"Your grasp of Milton's prosody is excellent, but here is a list of your spelling mistakes.\" A few years ago the examiners of first-year exams in my department included in their postmortem report for students a list of the common spelling mistakes in that year's exam scripts. This was posted on the main noticeboard, as was usual for these reports. Although meant to be helpful, the effect was weirdly condescending. As if to say: \"You idiots - you can't even get these right - how laughable.\" The practice was abandoned. </p> <p>Those who will find Blunkett's comparable list a gross imposition on those learning to express themselves creatively, might point out that the use of correct spelling is a fairly recent invention. Before there were dictionaries, there were no correct spellings. Accurate modern editions of great works from before the mid-18th century will let you see this in a moment. It is a nice irony that academics actually campaign for modern paperback editions that do not \"correct\" the spelling (and punctuation) of the great names of English lit. It is one of a secondary-school teacher's usual quandaries, whether to use the version of Macbeth that has the right (but wrong) spellings, or the wrong (but right) ones. </p> <p>Spelling became a preoccupation of the educated only after the publication of Samuel Johnson's great Dictionary of the English Language in 1755. Even if the noble lexicographer sometimes chose arbitrarily between competing representations of the same word, his decisions became authoritative. The very fact of his book, expanded and amended by others, made the idea of correctness possible. This is why Becky Sharp, the rebellious anti-heroine of Thackeray's Vanity Fair, throws a copy of Johnson's dictionary out of the coach window as she leaves her young ladies' finishing school. Down with pedantry! Yet we later find out that when she needs to write begging letters, her spelling and grammar are unimpeachable. </p> <p>Why worry, so long as we know what someone means? There, sadly, is the rub, for error-strewn spelling still tends to give the impression that someone does not know what he or she means. An examiner needs a strong faith in creativity not to flinch from the confusions of \"there\", \"their\" and \"they're\" that afflict many a 15-year-old. Distinctions of meaning are often behind spelling difficulties. The most sophisticated spellcheck programmes cannot keep from coursework submissions the confusion between a thing being \"dependent\" on another, and a person being a \"dependant\"; or between a \"discreet\" person and a \"discrete\" object. </p> <p>Spelling reformers, the revolutionaries of the language world, would solve everything forever, matching letters to sounds and losing these distinctions. They would not worry that someone who writes \"impeckable\" (yes, it happens) fails to grasp something about the derivation of the word, from the Latin for \"sin\". Or that the very many English A-grade students who put \"playwrite\" miss a grammatical logic (how can someone be an anything-\"write\"?) and an old idea of authorship (a playwright being not an inspired genius, but a manufacturer, like a wheelwright or a shipwright). </p> <p>And when we come to truly common words - items like \"although\", \"remember\" and \"women\" - on the Blunkett list, getting them wrong inescapably signifies an incapacity to retain what you read. Caring about spelling does look like caring about words. So, outside the exam room, what matters is knowing when you might not know. </p> <p>I will never forget the letter I once received as an admissions tutor from a candidate wanting to study English. Wishing to vaunt an enthusiasm for the classics, it began with a kind of inverse aplomb: \"I am currantly reading the novels of Jane Austin.\" The writer had had all the time in the world to check his spelling, but he was in a hurry to make his pitch.

      "bodyText": "A second man died today from injuries sustained during the Notting Hill carnival. The 28-year-old Asian was punched and kicked to the ground by a gang of males in Blenheim Crescent at 7.30pm on Monday and the police are treating his death late last night at St Mary's hospital, Paddington, as murder. The man's mother flew in from Pakistan last night. A delivery driver, Greg Watson, was the first person to die at the west London carnival since 1997 when he was fatally stabbed around 10pm on Monday. The 21-year-old man, who had a three-week-old daughter, was an innocent reveller and the victim of an unprovoked attack, police said. Mr Watson, from Northolt, west London, was taken by ambulance to St Mary's hospital, where he was declared dead. An estimated 1.5m people took to the streets for the annual bank holiday weekend celebration, despite heavy showers.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Imagine the scenario. At the conclusion of their annual shindig in Jackson Hole last week, the world's central bankers decided on a job swap. For the next year, Alan Greenspan would take up the reins at the European Central Bank in Frankfurt with the rest of the federal reserve board, while Wim Duisenberg and his colleagues at the ECB would take up residence in Washington. </p> <p>There is little doubt about what Mr Duisenberg would do faced with US inflation rising at 3.6% a year: he would put up rates in October whatever the consequences for the presidential election in November. But the more interesting question is what Mr Greenspan might do with the European economy if he were in the hot seat tomorrow. The markets are assuming that an ECB rate rise of 0.25 basis points is a certainty, with a half-point increase to bring Euroland inflation back under its 2% ceiling by no means ruled out. </p> <p>But the ECB has put itself in something of a bind. Higher interest rates are supposed to make the euro more attractive to investors by offering a higher rate of return, and this, in turn, should lead to lower inflation. If, after all the hawkish talk of the past few days, the ECB fails to raise rates, the euro will tumble. Yet, it may still tumble even if rates do go up, and the more rates are raised the further it may fall. Why? Because markets these days are less concerned about a currency's yield than about the prospects for growth that it offers. Dealers could easily conclude that higher European rates will choke off Europe's recovery, widening the growth deficit with the booming US economy. If that is the interpretation put on the ECB's decision, the euro will fall not rise, making Europe's alleged inflation problem even worse. This, indeed, seemed to be the way markets were heading yesterday when despite a concerted attempt to talk up the euro, the single currency fell below 90 cents against the dollar. </p> <p>So how would things stand were Mr Greenspan in charge? In the absence of a surge in European productivity to match that in the US, he might conclude that there is no alternative but to raise rates. But, in fact, Mr Greenspan's give-growth-a-chance strategy predated by several years any hard evidence of an improvement in US productivity growth. Were a similar line to be adopted tomorrow, there would be a short-term risk of the euro falling to a new record low. But over the medium term, the euro-dollar rate relies on the relative growth rates of Europe and the United States. Mr Greenspan seems to understand this. The question is: does Mr Duisenberg? </p> <p><strong> Gag exchange </strong><br> </p> <p> It was not wholly expected - participants in the battle for control of the great London Stock Exchange each turning up with a bag of gags. </p> <p>But that is what we got yesterday as Sweden's OM Gruppen, effectively a technology company which specialises in trading systems, tabled its unsolicited \u00a3808m takeover bid. </p> <p>First, we had the Swedes talking about saving the \"crown jewel\", which might be transformed into the future Microsoft of the UK with the right sort of visionary management. Then came the pooh-poohing from inside the exchange, claiming that all this technology is \"not state of the art, not difficult stuff\". </p> <p>In may not be, but if the London exchange had managed to do anything other than botch each and every systems project over the past 15 years its officials might not be in the pickle they are today - actively encouraging a \"white knight\" takeover by Frankfurt's Deutsche B\u00f6rse. </p> <p>What is clear is that we are witnessing the final act of so-called Wimbledonisation of the City. We invented the game, but now watch foreigners take all the trophies. </p> <p>The process has taken three centuries, most vividly illustrated over recent years by the steady capitulation of the City's great family-owned merchant banks which, having survived so many wars and plagues and scandals, finally succumbed to primarily American and German buyers. With capital having gone global, they just did not have the stomach for risk. </p> <p>These buyers, of course, now speak for a good portion of the ownership of the London exchange. And the big investment banks, as we now call them, simply want a market system that allows the most profitable (and global) clients to move in or out of equities with the minimum of fuss and at the lowest possible cost. </p> <p>Against this bloc vote are the small stockbrokers, many of them still British owned, who, in a straightforward sort of way, fear for their jobs. They just cannot understand why London is looking to give anything away while it continues to enjoy such a dominate role in equities across Europe - especially if the technology is such a cinch. </p> <p>The debate, and the education programme, have only just begun.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Imagine the scenario. At the conclusion of their annual shindig in Jackson Hole last week, the world's central bankers decided on a job swap. For the next year, Alan Greenspan would take up the reins at the European Central Bank in Frankfurt with the rest of the federal reserve board, while Wim Duisenberg and his colleagues at the ECB would take up residence in Washington. There is little doubt about what Mr Duisenberg would do faced with US inflation rising at 3.6% a year: he would put up rates in October whatever the consequences for the presidential election in November. But the more interesting question is what Mr Greenspan might do with the European economy if he were in the hot seat tomorrow. The markets are assuming that an ECB rate rise of 0.25 basis points is a certainty, with a half-point increase to bring Euroland inflation back under its 2% ceiling by no means ruled out. But the ECB has put itself in something of a bind. Higher interest rates are supposed to make the euro more attractive to investors by offering a higher rate of return, and this, in turn, should lead to lower inflation. If, after all the hawkish talk of the past few days, the ECB fails to raise rates, the euro will tumble. Yet, it may still tumble even if rates do go up, and the more rates are raised the further it may fall. Why? Because markets these days are less concerned about a currency's yield than about the prospects for growth that it offers. Dealers could easily conclude that higher European rates will choke off Europe's recovery, widening the growth deficit with the booming US economy. If that is the interpretation put on the ECB's decision, the euro will fall not rise, making Europe's alleged inflation problem even worse. This, indeed, seemed to be the way markets were heading yesterday when despite a concerted attempt to talk up the euro, the single currency fell below 90 cents against the dollar. So how would things stand were Mr Greenspan in charge? In the absence of a surge in European productivity to match that in the US, he might conclude that there is no alternative but to raise rates. But, in fact, Mr Greenspan's give-growth-a-chance strategy predated by several years any hard evidence of an improvement in US productivity growth. Were a similar line to be adopted tomorrow, there would be a short-term risk of the euro falling to a new record low. But over the medium term, the euro-dollar rate relies on the relative growth rates of Europe and the United States. Mr Greenspan seems to understand this. The question is: does Mr Duisenberg? Gag exchange It was not wholly expected - participants in the battle for control of the great London Stock Exchange each turning up with a bag of gags. But that is what we got yesterday as Sweden's OM Gruppen, effectively a technology company which specialises in trading systems, tabled its unsolicited \u00a3808m takeover bid. First, we had the Swedes talking about saving the \"crown jewel\", which might be transformed into the future Microsoft of the UK with the right sort of visionary management. Then came the pooh-poohing from inside the exchange, claiming that all this technology is \"not state of the art, not difficult stuff\". In may not be, but if the London exchange had managed to do anything other than botch each and every systems project over the past 15 years its officials might not be in the pickle they are today - actively encouraging a \"white knight\" takeover by Frankfurt's Deutsche B\u00f6rse. What is clear is that we are witnessing the final act of so-called Wimbledonisation of the City. We invented the game, but now watch foreigners take all the trophies. The process has taken three centuries, most vividly illustrated over recent years by the steady capitulation of the City's great family-owned merchant banks which, having survived so many wars and plagues and scandals, finally succumbed to primarily American and German buyers. With capital having gone global, they just did not have the stomach for risk. These buyers, of course, now speak for a good portion of the ownership of the London exchange. And the big investment banks, as we now call them, simply want a market system that allows the most profitable (and global) clients to move in or out of equities with the minimum of fuss and at the lowest possible cost. Against this bloc vote are the small stockbrokers, many of them still British owned, who, in a straightforward sort of way, fear for their jobs. They just cannot understand why London is looking to give anything away while it continues to enjoy such a dominate role in equities across Europe - especially if the technology is such a cinch. The debate, and the education programme, have only just begun.",

The UK-based retailer today announced 80 job losses from its 400-strong staff, mainly from the ranks of temporary staff and advisers. Letsbuyit, which pools together customers to bargain for lower prices from manufacturers of consumer goods, will remain heavily loss-making until 2003, according to analysts. The e-commerce company's second-quarter sales have jumped to \u00a34.4m, with its gross margin rising to 9.8% from 2.9%. The reorganisation will centralise Letsbuyit's European procurement, logistics and marketing activities and lead to one-off costs totalling \u00a3920,000 in the third quarter.
