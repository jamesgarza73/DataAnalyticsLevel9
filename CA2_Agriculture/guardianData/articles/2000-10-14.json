      "body": "<p>Rt Hon Tony Blair MP Prime Minister; Leader of the Labour Party (1). <br> </p> <p> Rt Hon Gordon Brown MP Chancellor of the Exchequer (3).<br> </p> <p> Alan Greenspan Chairman, American Federal Bank Reserve (7).</p> <p> The man revered as the architect of the unprecedented economic boom in the US is facing his biggest test. His every pout, strut, and subtle change in syntax or vocabulary is analysed and counter-analysed by global markets. His greatest test may come after next month's Presidential elections. The Fed, although politically independent, has held off from changing interest rates in the run-up to the polls. Greenspan, originally appointed by Ronald Reagan, was accused of losing George Bush Sr the 1992 election after interest rate hikes just before the poll. With the US trade deficit spiralling out of control and growth still stellar, Greenspan will be responsible for 'the soft landing' of the economy. Despite all the adulation he has received in the past, it is this job which will prove the ultimate test of his mythical abilities, and may prove the difference between global boom or global slump.<br> </p> <p> <br> Steve Case Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, AOL; chairman designate, AOL-Time Warner (59). </p> <p> If, in 10 years' time, the impact of the internet amounts to a fraction of the wild claims made for it now, then much of the credit will go to Steve Case. The proposed \u00a3128 billion merger of his company, America Online with Time Warner, itself trying to merge with UK music group, EMI, represents the first conjuncture of old and new media. He barely registered on last year's list but this year he was the star of the show at the Davos World Economic Forum, eclipsing even Bill Gates, and he was proclaimed king of the new establishment by the US glossies. The creation of AOL-Time Warner is the practical manifestation of digital convergence. Television, movies, music and computer games will be available on demand in homes over high-speed data links. Case was in a position to broker the deal because AOL was among that rarest of breeds: the profit-making internet company.<br> </p> <p> Alastair Campbell Press Secretary to the Prime Minister (5).<br> </p> <p> Sir Eddie George Governor, Bank of England (8). <br> </p> <p> 'Steady but ready' Eddie's influence over interest rates has strengthened over the past year. He has made the casting vote in the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee on at least two occasions, keeping mortgage costs constant since February. Sir Edward became Governor of the Bank of England in 1993. His term was renewed for a further five years in 1998, his powers then greatly enhanced by Labour's granting of operational independence to the Bank in 1997, but weakened by the removal of regulatory powers over the financial sector. Last month he helped coordinate an international effort to prop up the ailing euro. But he is a noted eurosceptic, and as the Chancellor has tempered his euro-enthusiasm, and the economy prospered, so the relationship between the two men has improved. They now get on well. </p> <p> Bill Clinton President of United States of America (4). <br> </p> <p> Clinton's foreign policy often lays the foundation for the UK's. Labour modelled its election campaign on the 1992 Clinton victory; Blair used Clinton to promote peace in Northern Ireland. The United States dominated Nato policy over Kosovo, refusing to deploy US ground troops. Refused to assist Blair to forge a republican compromise on the RUC issue, which Clinton thinks should be addressed as outlined in the Patten report. Recently his influence in the Mid-East has been questioned. Such is the ephemeral nature of political power that Clinton - whose term ends in January- is unlikely to figure in this list next year.<br> </p> <p> Bill Gates Chairman, Microsoft (2).<br> </p> <p> The past 12 months have not been a great year for the world's richest man. The software guru has suffered the ignominy of having his company branded a monopoly by the US government which is now examining ways of breaking the firm up. Nevertheless Gates, 44, is still worth more than $60bn and it is far from certain that Microsoft will do the splits. Slow to realise the importance of the internet, Gates is now refocusing Microsoft into a company which aims to write the code for the next generation of internet-compatible devices. Disliked by some for the way his company has dominated the industry, Gates, married with two children, does not outwardly give the impression of being a bully. Quiet and reserved Gates has pledged to give away 95 per cent of his wealth to civic and philanthropic causes when he dies.</p> <p> Rupert Murdoch Chairman and Chief Executive, News Corporation (6).<br> </p> <p> Four million daily Sun readers and the 700,000 Times readers. His Sunday Times and News of the World are formidable money-making machines. In BSkyB Murdoch has 40 per cent and effective control of Western Europe's most profitable broadcaster. Was diagnosed with low grade prostate cancer recently, so speculation mounts that he is grooming a successor. His son Lachlan was last week appointed deputy at News Corp and seems the sibling most likely. As the election nears there will again be speculation as to the influence Murdoch wields over his editors.<br> </p> <p> <br> Sir John Browne Chief executive, BP Amoco; Trustee of the British Museum (23).</p> <p> It has often been said of Sir John Browne that he wields more power and has more influence over our lives than the aver age minister. After September's fuel crisis demonstrated Government impotence in guaranteeing petrol supplies, and its inability to force oil companies to ensure them, the Prime Minister may himself ruefully reflect on the truth of this remark. Browne has built BP from an important, but second tier oil company, to a global 'supermajor' capable of competing with the likes of Exxon. Two significant deals - the purchase of US oil company Amoco for pounds 30bn in 1998 and its subsequent acquisition of Arco pounds 18bn - have propelled the company to a market value of nearly pounds 138 bn and to the second slot in the FTSE 100 index. </p> <p>Highest new entry<br> John Chambers President and CEO, Cisco Systems Inc. </p> <p> Chambers, 51, is the man who wired the world. His company, Cisco, makes the hardware and software which powers the internet. It does all the back-end, boring stuff which means that it is set to benefit massively from the demand for e-business solutions. 'Are you ready?' runs the company's ads heralding the internet revolution. Cisco certainly was and its share price soared 50,000 per cent in a decade. Chambers is the internet revolution's biggest cheerleader and is the biggest critic. Cisco became the most valuable firm in the US earlier this year when it temporarily overtook Microsoft. </p> <p> <br> Chris Gent Chief Executive, Vodafone (31).</p> <p> UK's market leader in mobile phones, Vodafone's coup de grace was the takeover of German telecom company Mannesmann, valuing it at more than \u00a382 billion. Has become the world's biggest mobile phone operator.</p> <p> Rt Hon Peter Mandelson MP Northern Ireland Secretary (25).</p> <p> Returned to Cabinet after only 10 months in wilderness. After initial success, the peace process now seems precariously balanced in the face of Unionist opposition and republican refusal to compromise.</p> <p> Jonathan Powell Downing Street Chief of Staff (9).</p> <p> Became Tony Blair's chief of staff in 1995. Acts as the PM's fixer, liaising with civil servants, and behind-the-scenes Northern Ireland envoy. Refuted allegations that he masterminded whispering campaigns against Mo Mowlam and Frank Dobson. </p> <p> Nobuyuki Idei President and CEO, Sony Corporation (154).</p> <p> Leader of the world's largest corporation since 1995. Sony pioneered the video recorder, Walkman and Mini-Disc. His are the slogans 'Digital Dream Kids' and 'ReGeneration'. </p> <p> Greg Dyke Director General, BBC (11).</p> <p> His appointment provoked William Hague to spend \u00a3100,000 on media analysts to monitor BBC output. Drastic shake-up is already under way, with rout of middle management. He has even banned croissants at morning meetings to save costs.</p> <p> Marjorie Scardino CEO, Pearson (48).</p> <p> First female executive of a FTSE 100 company. Former Chief Executive of the Economist, her influence as head of a company that owns the FT, Economist, Penguin Books, Baywatch and Madame Tussaud's secured her number eight slot in Fortune 's list of most powerful women. Shares have doubled in two years.</p> <p> Rt Hon David Blunkett MP Education and Employment Secretary (27).</p> <p> Has direct responsibility for two of the government's key policies: raising school standards and New Deal. Launched inquiry into the marking of national curriculum tests for 11 year olds, and has introduced 'citizenship' classes.</p> <p> Rt Hon John Prescott MP Deputy Prime Minister; Secretary for Environment, Transport and the Regions (13).</p> <p> Presides over an annual transport budget of pounds 3.7bn and housing budget of pounds 2.4bn. Joined Brown behind the 'forces of privilege' campaign. Offered somewhat too eagerly to take reins in running the country so Blair could take paternity leave.</p> <p> Gerry Robinson Chairman, Granada Group; Chairman, Arts Council (39).</p> <p> Granada own a third of the ITV network. At the Arts Council Robinson is in charge of pounds 384 million of government and lottery money. Sits on the Creative Industries taskforce. </p> <p> Rt Hon Jack Straw MP Home Secretary (28).</p> <p> Remains a figure of calm as storms rage over Labour but...criticised over watering down of Freedom of Information Bill; under pressure to introduce race reforms in the wake of the Lawrence report; criticised over Asylum Bill and voucher system for refugees. </p> <p> Rt Hon Robin Cook MP Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Secretary (44).</p> <p> Has been kept busy with Zimbabwe, Sierra Leone and Chechnya, and has frozen military exports to Zimbabwe. Has been pressing Blair to enter the European single currency at an earlier date.</p> <p> Paul Dacre Editor, Daily Mail (19).</p> <p> The Mail outstripped the Daily Mirror's circulation for the first time in 1998, selling 2,421,319, the second highest among UK dailies. Instigated anti-GM foods campaign.

      "bodyText": "Rt Hon Tony Blair MP Prime Minister; Leader of the Labour Party (1). Rt Hon Gordon Brown MP Chancellor of the Exchequer (3). Alan Greenspan Chairman, American Federal Bank Reserve (7). The man revered as the architect of the unprecedented economic boom in the US is facing his biggest test. His every pout, strut, and subtle change in syntax or vocabulary is analysed and counter-analysed by global markets. His greatest test may come after next month's Presidential elections. The Fed, although politically independent, has held off from changing interest rates in the run-up to the polls. Greenspan, originally appointed by Ronald Reagan, was accused of losing George Bush Sr the 1992 election after interest rate hikes just before the poll. With the US trade deficit spiralling out of control and growth still stellar, Greenspan will be responsible for 'the soft landing' of the economy. Despite all the adulation he has received in the past, it is this job which will prove the ultimate test of his mythical abilities, and may prove the difference between global boom or global slump. Steve Case Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, AOL; chairman designate, AOL-Time Warner (59). If, in 10 years' time, the impact of the internet amounts to a fraction of the wild claims made for it now, then much of the credit will go to Steve Case. The proposed \u00a3128 billion merger of his company, America Online with Time Warner, itself trying to merge with UK music group, EMI, represents the first conjuncture of old and new media. He barely registered on last year's list but this year he was the star of the show at the Davos World Economic Forum, eclipsing even Bill Gates, and he was proclaimed king of the new establishment by the US glossies. The creation of AOL-Time Warner is the practical manifestation of digital convergence. Television, movies, music and computer games will be available on demand in homes over high-speed data links. Case was in a position to broker the deal because AOL was among that rarest of breeds: the profit-making internet company. Alastair Campbell Press Secretary to the Prime Minister (5). Sir Eddie George Governor, Bank of England (8). 'Steady but ready' Eddie's influence over interest rates has strengthened over the past year. He has made the casting vote in the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee on at least two occasions, keeping mortgage costs constant since February. Sir Edward became Governor of the Bank of England in 1993. His term was renewed for a further five years in 1998, his powers then greatly enhanced by Labour's granting of operational independence to the Bank in 1997, but weakened by the removal of regulatory powers over the financial sector. Last month he helped coordinate an international effort to prop up the ailing euro. But he is a noted eurosceptic, and as the Chancellor has tempered his euro-enthusiasm, and the economy prospered, so the relationship between the two men has improved. They now get on well. Bill Clinton President of United States of America (4). Clinton's foreign policy often lays the foundation for the UK's. Labour modelled its election campaign on the 1992 Clinton victory; Blair used Clinton to promote peace in Northern Ireland. The United States dominated Nato policy over Kosovo, refusing to deploy US ground troops. Refused to assist Blair to forge a republican compromise on the RUC issue, which Clinton thinks should be addressed as outlined in the Patten report. Recently his influence in the Mid-East has been questioned. Such is the ephemeral nature of political power that Clinton - whose term ends in January- is unlikely to figure in this list next year. Bill Gates Chairman, Microsoft (2). The past 12 months have not been a great year for the world's richest man. The software guru has suffered the ignominy of having his company branded a monopoly by the US government which is now examining ways of breaking the firm up. Nevertheless Gates, 44, is still worth more than $60bn and it is far from certain that Microsoft will do the splits. Slow to realise the importance of the internet, Gates is now refocusing Microsoft into a company which aims to write the code for the next generation of internet-compatible devices. Disliked by some for the way his company has dominated the industry, Gates, married with two children, does not outwardly give the impression of being a bully. Quiet and reserved Gates has pledged to give away 95 per cent of his wealth to civic and philanthropic causes when he dies. Rupert Murdoch Chairman and Chief Executive, News Corporation (6). Four million daily Sun readers and the 700,000 Times readers. His Sunday Times and News of the World are formidable money-making machines. In BSkyB Murdoch has 40 per cent and effective control of Western Europe's most profitable broadcaster. Was diagnosed with low grade prostate cancer recently, so speculation mounts that he is grooming a successor. His son Lachlan was last week appointed deputy at News Corp and seems the sibling most likely. As the election nears there will again be speculation as to the influence Murdoch wields over his editors. Sir John Browne Chief executive, BP Amoco; Trustee of the British Museum (23). It has often been said of Sir John Browne that he wields more power and has more influence over our lives than the aver age minister. After September's fuel crisis demonstrated Government impotence in guaranteeing petrol supplies, and its inability to force oil companies to ensure them, the Prime Minister may himself ruefully reflect on the truth of this remark. Browne has built BP from an important, but second tier oil company, to a global 'supermajor' capable of competing with the likes of Exxon. Two significant deals - the purchase of US oil company Amoco for pounds 30bn in 1998 and its subsequent acquisition of Arco pounds 18bn - have propelled the company to a market value of nearly pounds 138 bn and to the second slot in the FTSE 100 index. Highest new entry John Chambers President and CEO, Cisco Systems Inc. Chambers, 51, is the man who wired the world. His company, Cisco, makes the hardware and software which powers the internet. It does all the back-end, boring stuff which means that it is set to benefit massively from the demand for e-business solutions. 'Are you ready?' runs the company's ads heralding the internet revolution. Cisco certainly was and its share price soared 50,000 per cent in a decade. Chambers is the internet revolution's biggest cheerleader and is the biggest critic. Cisco became the most valuable firm in the US earlier this year when it temporarily overtook Microsoft. Chris Gent Chief Executive, Vodafone (31). UK's market leader in mobile phones, Vodafone's coup de grace was the takeover of German telecom company Mannesmann, valuing it at more than \u00a382 billion. Has become the world's biggest mobile phone operator. Rt Hon Peter Mandelson MP Northern Ireland Secretary (25). Returned to Cabinet after only 10 months in wilderness. After initial success, the peace process now seems precariously balanced in the face of Unionist opposition and republican refusal to compromise. Jonathan Powell Downing Street Chief of Staff (9). Became Tony Blair's chief of staff in 1995. Acts as the PM's fixer, liaising with civil servants, and behind-the-scenes Northern Ireland envoy. Refuted allegations that he masterminded whispering campaigns against Mo Mowlam and Frank Dobson. Nobuyuki Idei President and CEO, Sony Corporation (154). Leader of the world's largest corporation since 1995. Sony pioneered the video recorder, Walkman and Mini-Disc. His are the slogans 'Digital Dream Kids' and 'ReGeneration'. Greg Dyke Director General, BBC (11). His appointment provoked William Hague to spend \u00a3100,000 on media analysts to monitor BBC output. Drastic shake-up is already under way, with rout of middle management. He has even banned croissants at morning meetings to save costs. Marjorie Scardino CEO, Pearson (48). First female executive of a FTSE 100 company. Former Chief Executive of the Economist, her influence as head of a company that owns the FT, Economist, Penguin Books, Baywatch and Madame Tussaud's secured her number eight slot in Fortune 's list of most powerful women. Shares have doubled in two years. Rt Hon David Blunkett MP Education and Employment Secretary (27). Has direct responsibility for two of the government's key policies: raising school standards and New Deal. Launched inquiry into the marking of national curriculum tests for 11 year olds, and has introduced 'citizenship' classes. Rt Hon John Prescott MP Deputy Prime Minister; Secretary for Environment, Transport and the Regions (13). Presides over an annual transport budget of pounds 3.7bn and housing budget of pounds 2.4bn. Joined Brown behind the 'forces of privilege' campaign. Offered somewhat too eagerly to take reins in running the country so Blair could take paternity leave. Gerry Robinson Chairman, Granada Group; Chairman, Arts Council (39). Granada own a third of the ITV network. At the Arts Council Robinson is in charge of pounds 384 million of government and lottery money. Sits on the Creative Industries taskforce. Rt Hon Jack Straw MP Home Secretary (28). Remains a figure of calm as storms rage over Labour but...criticised over watering down of Freedom of Information Bill; under pressure to introduce race reforms in the wake of the Lawrence report; criticised over Asylum Bill and voucher system for refugees. Rt Hon Robin Cook MP Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Secretary (44). Has been kept busy with Zimbabwe, Sierra Leone and Chechnya, and has frozen military exports to Zimbabwe. Has been pressing Blair to enter the European single currency at an earlier date. Paul Dacre Editor, Daily Mail (19). The Mail outstripped the Daily Mirror's circulation for the first time in 1998, selling 2,421,319, the second highest among UK dailies. Instigated anti-GM foods campaign. Jumped on the asylum-seekers bandwagon, portraying many of them as bogus and thieves. Sir Richard Sykes Chairman and Chief Executive, Glaxo Wellcome (22). Appointed by Blair to the Council for Science and Technology, he opened the Edward Jenner Institute for vaccine research, to which Glaxo contributed pounds 10m. In May 1999 was named Business Leader of the Year. Paid pounds 3.63m last year. Sir Richard Branson Founder &amp; Chairman, Virgin (32). Recently sold extracts of his autobiography Losing My Virginity to the Sun while a rival paper extracted Tom Bower's less flattering and unauthorised biography. Still hoping to land licence for National Lottery. Sir Peter Bonfield Chief Executive, British Telecommunications; Non-executive director, AstraZeneca (26). BT Cellnet will have stolen a march on competitors if its launch of the UK's first high-speed internet access succeeds. Lord Derry Irvine of Lairg QC Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain (33). Introduced Tony Blair to Cherie Booth when they were pupils in his chambers. His changes to the trial-by-jury system provoked outrage, especially from the Law Society. Now looking at judicial appointments after objections to his own choices. Wim Duisenburg President, European Central Bank (35). Dutch ex-banker now dubbed Mr Euro. Low value of the currency has adverse effect on UK exports to Euroland. The ECB faces allegations of lack of transparency in terms of policy and interest-rate decisions. Gerhard Schroder Chancellor, Germany (12). Glossy election campaign won him power and tag of 'Herr Blair', he took over a delicate role in European politics and an economy with 10.6% unemployment - 5m people. Hit early on by the departure of finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine, due to policy divisions. Ed Balls Chief Economic Adviser to Gordon Brown (45). One of a handful of people the Chancellor will listen to, Balls is a prime mover behind the Americanisation of Labour economic policy. Regarded as 'deputy chancellor', he sees every key Treasury paper and is an advocate of welfare-to-work and promoting individual opportunity. Philip Gould Strategic Adviser (60). One of the architects of New Labour, key adviser to Tony Blair; married to Gail Rebuck of Random House. Gould is one of the most important people in Blair's inner circle. Mark Moody-Stuart Group Chairman, Royal Dutch Shell (77). His reforms have upturned Shell's fortunes. Despite efforts to repair relations with the Ogoni people of Nigeria over the past two years ending in violence, with Ken Saro-Wiwa's successor being charged with murder and arson, Moody-Stuart has been hailed as succeeding in shaking up the Anglo-Dutch group and making it perform. Terry Leahy Chief Executive, Tesco (15). With a p\u00a3500m investment programme that will see 22 new stores and 10,000 new jobs, Leahy looks set to ensure Tesco retains its number one slot with 15% of the grocery market. Member of Demos think tank and the government's competitiveness taskforce. David Yelland Editor, the Sun (54). As editor of the best-selling daily tabloid his influence will grow as the election looms and as the debate over the Euro becomes sharper. Sir Robert May President designate, Royal Society; former Chief Scientific Adviser to the Government; Head of Office of Science and Technology (34). Argues for increased government funding for research, and more openness with scientific advice given to government departments. Co-wrote (with Liam Donaldson) report on GM foods, recommending surveillance but also saying there's 'no current evidence' of harmfulness. Louis Gerstner Chairman and CEO, IBM (93). Heading the US computer giant since 1993, he has taken its total assets to $86bn. Michael Eisner Chairman, Walt Disney Corporation (47). In his 14-year tenure Disney's market value has risen from $2bn to $75bn. But he lost in legal battle against former deputy Jeffrey Katzenberg over loss of earnings. Steve Jobs Interim CEO, Co-founder Apple Computer Inc (68). Back in the limelight, turning the fortunes of Apple around with the new iMac. Results show increased demand for PowerMac G4 and new PowerBooks. Linus Torvalds Programmer; originated Linux operating system (153). Bill Gates's nemesis: a Finnish student who wrote an operating system to run his own computer seven years ago and then publicised its code on the internet so other programmers could copy, refine and develop it. Linux, the free operating system became the favourite of geeks and system operators and has reached critical mass as many of the largest software and hardware makers announced plans to offer customers Linux-based products.

      "trailText": "<p> The virtual world has a role, but the workplace will remain as a hub of innovation, writes  Richard Scase</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The internet revolution, say the pundits, raises the possibility of the virtual organisation, allowing people to work from home, their back gardens or even their favourite holiday destinations. The era of the interconnected, wired corporation will see the end of the traditional boundaries between home, the workplace and leisure. </p> <p>If this were true, it would dramatically affect all our institutions. It could be truly stated that the information age is structured on quite different principles from those of the industrial economy. Commuting, like the office block and the central business district, would be a thing of the past. Congestion and traffic pollution would disappear. The very basis of urbanism as a way of life would be redundant. </p> <p>How realistic is this scenario? For a start, it is questionable whether knowledge-based jobs will be in a majority. Other workers - check-out staff, healthcare workers, teachers and those delivering personal services - will always need to travel to work to earn a living. But even for knowledge workers, it is unlikely to be the end of commuting to work. </p> <p>This is because the modern corporation can only be competitive through continuous innovation. </p> <p>Innovation depends on creativity. And a key factor in creativity is sociability. So although knowledge employees may technically be able to work from home, it will re-main necessary for them to meet each other, to interact and to brainstorm. It is through face-to-face contact between colleagues that ideas for new products, business leads and problem-solving emerge. This makes the physical workplace just as important in the future organisation as now. How do companies encourage sociability? </p> <p>The first step is to create effective team dynamics in which personal compatibilities are as important as technical skills. Witness how this is given priority by advertising agencies, publishing houses, R&amp;D departments and sales teams. Colleagues need to get on with each other and have fun together. </p> <p>Consider also workplace architecture. Many companies are redesigning their workplaces around centrally located cafes to encourage socialisation between colleagues who would otherwise rarely meet. In their physical layout, management consultancies and software design firms often resemble airport lounges with their sofas or-ganised around vending machines. </p> <p>For many companies, geographical location is regarded as of utmost importance, even in this age of the much-heralded death of distance. Again, this is to encourage sociability. The reason so many knowledge-based businesses remain in London, despite its congestion and high rental costs, is the cluster factor. The proximity of pubs, restaurants and wine bars enables colleagues to stay in contact out of work. From this, many new business ideas develop. </p> <p>Move to an out-of-town site with excellent facilities and lower costs and the business can die because of the lack of after-hours informal socialisation. For this reason Philips moved some of its design functions from Eindhoven to Amsterdam. It offers a buzz that attracts young creative staff as well as an infrastructure that allows it to flourish. </p> <p>For many companies, corporate events are organised to foster employee sociability. Although the formal agenda may be to approve strategic plans, their real contribution is to bring together colleagues who would otherwise never see each other. This is particularly important for global corporations. Their project teams may be organised to interact through internet technologies but for trust and the exchange of ideas to develop, periodic face-to-face sociability is vital. </p> <p>All such approaches to encouraging sociability at-tempt to nurture tacit knowledge - to encourage colleagues to understand how others work. This strengthens our own personal competencies but at the same time makes us inter-dependent. Because we work well together, we become good at this because others are good at that. I can concentrate on developing my strengths and so can you. We understand how each other thinks and how we each prefer to do different things in an informal but clearly understood division of labour. Only face-to-face sociability allows this to happen. </p> <p>This is why some high-spending football clubs fail to realise their true potential. Buying star players is not enough. Look at Chelsea. To be successful, each player needs to understand how his teammates think. On-the-pitch training is not a substitute for socialisation - which is why many managers turn a blind eye to some of their players' extramural antics. </p> <p>Equally, corporate success is not achieved by hiring superstars. The real key to high performance is combining in-dividual talents through shared understanding and 'hidden' tacit knowledge gained through intense or-ganisational sociability. Many small firms are good at this, particularly if they are located in geographical clusters that facilitate after-hours contacts. </p> <p>Internet technologies will change the ways we work. We will work more from home and communicate with colleagues across greater distances. But this will not make the workplace redundant.

      "bodyText": "The internet revolution, say the pundits, raises the possibility of the virtual organisation, allowing people to work from home, their back gardens or even their favourite holiday destinations. The era of the interconnected, wired corporation will see the end of the traditional boundaries between home, the workplace and leisure. If this were true, it would dramatically affect all our institutions. It could be truly stated that the information age is structured on quite different principles from those of the industrial economy. Commuting, like the office block and the central business district, would be a thing of the past. Congestion and traffic pollution would disappear. The very basis of urbanism as a way of life would be redundant. How realistic is this scenario? For a start, it is questionable whether knowledge-based jobs will be in a majority. Other workers - check-out staff, healthcare workers, teachers and those delivering personal services - will always need to travel to work to earn a living. But even for knowledge workers, it is unlikely to be the end of commuting to work. This is because the modern corporation can only be competitive through continuous innovation. Innovation depends on creativity. And a key factor in creativity is sociability. So although knowledge employees may technically be able to work from home, it will re-main necessary for them to meet each other, to interact and to brainstorm. It is through face-to-face contact between colleagues that ideas for new products, business leads and problem-solving emerge. This makes the physical workplace just as important in the future organisation as now. How do companies encourage sociability? The first step is to create effective team dynamics in which personal compatibilities are as important as technical skills. Witness how this is given priority by advertising agencies, publishing houses, R&amp;D departments and sales teams. Colleagues need to get on with each other and have fun together. Consider also workplace architecture. Many companies are redesigning their workplaces around centrally located cafes to encourage socialisation between colleagues who would otherwise rarely meet. In their physical layout, management consultancies and software design firms often resemble airport lounges with their sofas or-ganised around vending machines. For many companies, geographical location is regarded as of utmost importance, even in this age of the much-heralded death of distance. Again, this is to encourage sociability. The reason so many knowledge-based businesses remain in London, despite its congestion and high rental costs, is the cluster factor. The proximity of pubs, restaurants and wine bars enables colleagues to stay in contact out of work. From this, many new business ideas develop. Move to an out-of-town site with excellent facilities and lower costs and the business can die because of the lack of after-hours informal socialisation. For this reason Philips moved some of its design functions from Eindhoven to Amsterdam. It offers a buzz that attracts young creative staff as well as an infrastructure that allows it to flourish. For many companies, corporate events are organised to foster employee sociability. Although the formal agenda may be to approve strategic plans, their real contribution is to bring together colleagues who would otherwise never see each other. This is particularly important for global corporations. Their project teams may be organised to interact through internet technologies but for trust and the exchange of ideas to develop, periodic face-to-face sociability is vital. All such approaches to encouraging sociability at-tempt to nurture tacit knowledge - to encourage colleagues to understand how others work. This strengthens our own personal competencies but at the same time makes us inter-dependent. Because we work well together, we become good at this because others are good at that. I can concentrate on developing my strengths and so can you. We understand how each other thinks and how we each prefer to do different things in an informal but clearly understood division of labour. Only face-to-face sociability allows this to happen. This is why some high-spending football clubs fail to realise their true potential. Buying star players is not enough. Look at Chelsea. To be successful, each player needs to understand how his teammates think. On-the-pitch training is not a substitute for socialisation - which is why many managers turn a blind eye to some of their players' extramural antics. Equally, corporate success is not achieved by hiring superstars. The real key to high performance is combining in-dividual talents through shared understanding and 'hidden' tacit knowledge gained through intense or-ganisational sociability. Many small firms are good at this, particularly if they are located in geographical clusters that facilitate after-hours contacts. Internet technologies will change the ways we work. We will work more from home and communicate with colleagues across greater distances. But this will not make the workplace redundant. Rather, workplaces will be-come think-tanks to stimulate corporate creativity and innovation. Generating and managing tacit knowledge through colleague sociability will be a major challenge. A revolution in management practices will be required if sociability is to be combined with the internet to achieve competitive success. It's a dating agency, a social circle... and a job As old forms of community break down, people are increasingly reliant on the workplace for sociability and a sense of belonging, according to a report by careers consultancy Sanders &amp; Sidney. The report, Friendship Works, shows that sociability is an important element in people's decision to join - and stay with - a company and commit themselves more to work. Two-thirds of respondents said that a sense of community compensated for discontents such as pay. The office has also become much more than a place to work; 80 per cent of employees make friendships that extend beyond the office, and a quarter meet their partner there. Although the report finds that friendship and community have strong business benefits in staff retention and motivation, only 8 per cent of organisations have formal policies for fostering them. A resounding 94 per cent of employees think their employers are missing a trick. Richard Scase is author of Britain in 2010 (Capstone Publishing, 2000) and a professor at the University of Kent",

'There are two kinds of conferences,' he says, 'the one I am told to go to; and the one I elect or even pay to go to.'

Nowadays, though, you are expected to identify the 'break-out' sessions that meet your special interests, and to fully participate in working on problems or debating with the chairperson.

'There is generally a much stronger business focus, and the emphasis is on obtaining the skills and ideas that you are going to need at work.

Then Yuvraj, who made 84 from 80 balls against Australia last Saturday in his first one-day international innings, scored 41 from 35 deliveries before being brilliantly held by Jonty Rhodes, diving forward at long-on.</p> <p>Yuvraj's age has been declared as anything between 18 and 21 - most people are settling for 19 - and he is clearly a precocious talent. He produced a dazzling array of sweetly timed shots against Australia, but yesterday he relied more on brute force.</p> <p>India would have topped 300 but for losing four wickets in their final seven balls. Allan Donald's figures of two for 34 from 10 overs were outstanding in the midst of such carnage.</p> <p>Gary Kirsten, run out going for a third, and Kallis, who skied to mid-on, self-destructed as South Africa quickly lost two men who could anchor a decent run chase. Rhodes and Boucher rattled along at more than five an over, but those early wickets meant there was no room for error.</p> <p>When Rhodes was wonderfully caught on the midwicket boundary by Venkatesh Prasad, who held the ball high above his head and then managed to remain inside the rope as he fell, South Africa's chances effectively ended.</p> <p>Sir Paul Condon, the head of the ICC's anti-corruption unit, will make a special presentation to the ICC's executive board here next week to explain the structure and remit of his work.</p> <p>The council is investing \u00a32.7m in its campaign, which was launched after match-rigging scandals enveloped the game this year.</p> <p>The disgraced former South African captain Hansie Cronje was banned for life on Wednesday after he admitted receiving money from bookmakers, and the former Pakistan captain Salim Malik and his Indian counterpart Kapil Dev have also been at the centre of various corruption charges in recent months.</p> <p>The meeting is also expected to ratify the issuing of declaration forms to all international players, umpires, ref- erees, officials, administrators, employees and groundsmen.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sourav Ganguly's unbeaten innings of 141 ensured India's impressive passage to tomorrow's final of the International Cricket Council's Knockout 2000 trophy. A showdown here between New Zealand and India may not have been predicted but, having beaten Australia and now South Africa in their past two matches, India deserve their place. Ganguly did not make many friends at Lancashire during the summer - he was regarded as a solitary figure - but he remains one of the world's leading batsmen, especially in one-day cricket. His innings came from only 142 balls and, with Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and the new sensation Yuvraj Singh also batting punishingly, India swept to 295 for six from their 50 overs. After losing four wickets in the opening eight overs, South Africa never looked like threatening India's score. Even with Mark Boucher making 60, their losing margin was still 95 runs. South Africa were a shadow of the team that crushed England by eight wickets in the quarter-final on Tuesday. Once Tendulkar had made his usual early charge - Roger Telemachus was the principal sufferer this time - Ganguly dominated India's innings. With exquisite timing, the left-hander struck Nicky Boje for three sixes in two overs and Jacques Kallis was subjected to a ferocious assault in the closing overs. Dravid was as polished as ever during his partnership of 145 from 25 overs with Ganguly. Then Yuvraj, who made 84 from 80 balls against Australia last Saturday in his first one-day international innings, scored 41 from 35 deliveries before being brilliantly held by Jonty Rhodes, diving forward at long-on. Yuvraj's age has been declared as anything between 18 and 21 - most people are settling for 19 - and he is clearly a precocious talent. He produced a dazzling array of sweetly timed shots against Australia, but yesterday he relied more on brute force. India would have topped 300 but for losing four wickets in their final seven balls. Allan Donald's figures of two for 34 from 10 overs were outstanding in the midst of such carnage. Gary Kirsten, run out going for a third, and Kallis, who skied to mid-on, self-destructed as South Africa quickly lost two men who could anchor a decent run chase. Rhodes and Boucher rattled along at more than five an over, but those early wickets meant there was no room for error. When Rhodes was wonderfully caught on the midwicket boundary by Venkatesh Prasad, who held the ball high above his head and then managed to remain inside the rope as he fell, South Africa's chances effectively ended. Sir Paul Condon, the head of the ICC's anti-corruption unit, will make a special presentation to the ICC's executive board here next week to explain the structure and remit of his work. The council is investing \u00a32.7m in its campaign, which was launched after match-rigging scandals enveloped the game this year. The disgraced former South African captain Hansie Cronje was banned for life on Wednesday after he admitted receiving money from bookmakers, and the former Pakistan captain Salim Malik and his Indian counterpart Kapil Dev have also been at the centre of various corruption charges in recent months. The meeting is also expected to ratify the issuing of declaration forms to all international players, umpires, ref- erees, officials, administrators, employees and groundsmen.",

A paring of county staff has always been on the agenda and it has long been felt that there are too many players of modest standard with no future in the game being subsidised when the money could be more gainfully spent. But there is genuine concern from players and their employers that the cutbacks are being made because the central administration, while speaking positively, is paying little more than lip service to the county game. Administrators will say that the shortfall has been caused by what was always perceived as a lacklustre series against Zimbabwe coming in under budget and that income from the much higher-profile series against West Indies was damaged by the games at Edgbaston and Headingley that lasted three and two days respectively and so deprived them of profits from a potential three full houses over those weekends.

In May 1996, when Sir Alex Ferguson was celebrating another Double, Taylor had just guided Dover to 20th in the Vauxhall Conference. Nor has Taylor forgotten his first taste of Ferguson a few months later when he was coaching England's Under-21s. He was cowering behind his desk even before a Scottish voice answered the phone in a way which told him to forget any chit-chat. </p> <p>\"I was frightened out of my life to make the call,\" Taylor recalls. \"And when Alex answered he must have had a bad day because he had the raving hump. I was only ringing to do him a favour. I thought Nicky Butt had an injury which meant he would want me to rest him.\" </p> <p>This afternoon at Filbert Street there will be no favours from Taylor and no complaints if Ferguson has the raving hump. Leicester begin with a one-point advantage, and the flood of letters Taylor has received since the club went top suggests his postman - like Howard Wilkinson - must be suffering with a bad side. </p> <p>Ferguson was not among the admiring scribes but Taylor does not tremble at the thought of him now. When he was deposed as under-21 coach 16 months ago Ferguson was among the first to phone to say how much United's players had enjoyed working with him. And might Ferguson regret twice inviting Taylor to training during his stint with England? </p> <p>\"I learned lots of little things about how he wanted training done,\" Taylor says. \"The first time I happened to be staying at a hotel where Sir Alex was going to the gym that night. As I came away from the gym he drove up in his nice car and tooted. For me it was very brave but I asked whether he fancied a drink later. </p> <p>\"We had a good hour talking away, which was tremendous. I spoke to him about his training and what a good tempo it was. And he shared some experiences he'd had at Aberdeen and United, talking about certain players. To me he does it right. He has a very straight manner.\" </p> <p>Those who have worked under Taylor say he has a similar style, as Stan Collymore found out. And the 47-year-old has not arrived at the top by accident. He starting coaching at 17 when, as a Southend winger, he formed a team comprising his mates at the local youth club. </p> <p>\"We went through the divisions very quickly, won the leagues and cups,\" Taylor recalls. \"I've planned all my life to be a coach. There was never a time I wasn't managing a Sunday team until I got my first Saturday club, which was Dartford in 1986. I've used so many bits of paper writing down different teams, it used to drive my wife mad.\" </p> <p>For a man who played for Crystal Palace, Tottenham and England, that was some commitment. Not all the jobs have been glamorous or successful - he was sacked by Southend in 1995 - but each has moulded a coach so highly respected that he would be many people's choice as England manager. </p> <p>Ultimately that is his ambition. During his time at Lancaster Gate he studied Glenn Hoddle's press conferences and listened to his tactics as part of his preparation. But at this stage he rules himself out. </p> <p>\"It doesn't frighten me in terms of the types of football you face,\" he says. \"I'm confident I can handle that but I feel to leave after four months at Leicester would be letting them down badly.\" </p> <p>Taylor will feel let down if Kevin Keegan's successor is not English. He supports the idea of grooming coaches within the FA but stresses no one could step into the top job without extensive club experience. The ideal, he accepts, could be to have emerging managers working part-time with England. </p> <p>\"If you had just done the younger levels with England I'm sure you could go as far as the under-21s,\" he says. \"But it's very different from dealing with the really powerful players and the pressure. It's also not just about coaching. Doing a session with England is easy because you've got the best players and the best facilities. It's the selection and the tactics that make it a hard job.\" </p> <p>Taylor, of course, has made the Leicester job look easy since arriving in June. As in his previous post at Gillingham, where he won promotion from the Second Division at the first attempt, he has inherited a strong set-up rather than a crisis. </p> <p>But that should not detract from his sensible policy of tinkering rather than overhauling. He is far more of a tracksuit manager than his predecessor Martin O'Neill and the enjoyment he gleans from coaching is obvious. </p> <p>Just as Taylor's under-21s won six European Championship qualifiers without conceding a goal, Leicester have gone top with their defence breached only twice. The worry for Taylor, September's manager of the month, is that his side have scored only seven times. </p> <p>\"That goes back to the frustrating thing with Stan,\" he says, \"because I signed Ade [Akinbiyi] to play alongside him. Stan is potentially the best centre-forward in England receiving the ball with his back to goal and I wanted Ade making forward runs. Now I've had to change it.\" </p> <p>Taylor's treatment of the under-performing Collymore showed the hard side of a man who admits his biggest problem can be that he gets too close to his squad. </p> <p>\"The way he handles players stands out,\" says Andy Hessenthaler, the Gillingham manager who spent time with Taylor at Dartford, Watford and Gillingham. \"He recognises you can't treat players the same and his coaching's brilliant. He had something different every day and it was so interesting you wanted to come in. Peter's serious when he has to be but he loves a laugh and a joke.\" </p> <p>At the moment there is laughter aplenty but Taylor is not checking out potential Champions League opponents yet. He might if, at 4.45pm, Ferguson has the raving hump.</p>",

He starting coaching at 17 when, as a Southend winger, he formed a team comprising his mates at the local youth club. \"We went through the divisions very quickly, won the leagues and cups,\" Taylor recalls. \"I've planned all my life to be a coach. There was never a time I wasn't managing a Sunday team until I got my first Saturday club, which was Dartford in 1986. I've used so many bits of paper writing down different teams, it used to drive my wife mad.\" For a man who played for Crystal Palace, Tottenham and England, that was some commitment. Not all the jobs have been glamorous or successful - he was sacked by Southend in 1995 - but each has moulded a coach so highly respected that he would be many people's choice as England manager. Ultimately that is his ambition. During his time at Lancaster Gate he studied Glenn Hoddle's press conferences and listened to his tactics as part of his preparation. But at this stage he rules himself out. \"It doesn't frighten me in terms of the types of football you face,\" he says. \"I'm confident I can handle that but I feel to leave after four months at Leicester would be letting them down badly.\" Taylor will feel let down if Kevin Keegan's successor is not English. He supports the idea of grooming coaches within the FA but stresses no one could step into the top job without extensive club experience. The ideal, he accepts, could be to have emerging managers working part-time with England. \"If you had just done the younger levels with England I'm sure you could go as far as the under-21s,\" he says. \"But it's very different from dealing with the really powerful players and the pressure. It's also not just about coaching. Doing a session with England is easy because you've got the best players and the best facilities. It's the selection and the tactics that make it a hard job.\" Taylor, of course, has made the Leicester job look easy since arriving in June. As in his previous post at Gillingham, where he won promotion from the Second Division at the first attempt, he has inherited a strong set-up rather than a crisis. But that should not detract from his sensible policy of tinkering rather than overhauling. He is far more of a tracksuit manager than his predecessor Martin O'Neill and the enjoyment he gleans from coaching is obvious. Just as Taylor's under-21s won six European Championship qualifiers without conceding a goal, Leicester have gone top with their defence breached only twice. The worry for Taylor, September's manager of the month, is that his side have scored only seven times. \"That goes back to the frustrating thing with Stan,\" he says, \"because I signed Ade [Akinbiyi] to play alongside him. Stan is potentially the best centre-forward in England receiving the ball with his back to goal and I wanted Ade making forward runs. Now I've had to change it.\" Taylor's treatment of the under-performing Collymore showed the hard side of a man who admits his biggest problem can be that he gets too close to his squad. \"The way he handles players stands out,\" says Andy Hessenthaler, the Gillingham manager who spent time with Taylor at Dartford, Watford and Gillingham. \"He recognises you can't treat players the same and his coaching's brilliant. He had something different every day and it was so interesting you wanted to come in. Peter's serious when he has to be but he loves a laugh and a joke.\" At the moment there is laughter aplenty but Taylor is not checking out potential Champions League opponents yet. He might if, at 4.45pm, Ferguson has the raving hump.",

It was the Londoners' eye-catching embarrassment at the Stadium of Light last year and a subsequent home defeat to Leeds that prompted Vialli to buy the 28-year-old from Sheffield Wednesday for \u00a32.7m 10 months ago. </p> <p>But any thought that his signing was a knee-jerk reaction to those losses was quickly dispelled by a series of impressive defensive displays, earning him a regular place at the heart of Chelsea's defence. Indeed, he did not taste Premiership defeat until returning to Hillsborough for his 16th appearance. </p> <p>With such form behind him, it was somewhat surprising that Thome found himself out of favour with Vialli this season. He started one top-flight game for the Londoners - the ignominious 2-0 defeat at Bradford in August - before swapping the King's Road for the Quayside, the yuppie pads for the \"howay the lads\" in a club record \u00a34.5m deal. </p> <p>\"I was not looking for a move,\" he says. \"Chelsea is a massive club and they could be one of the great teams in England over the next few years. It would have been good to be a part of that. </p> <p>\"But there are a lot of quality players there. I just wanted to play football and Vialli could not offer me the chance to be a first-team regular. I think Chelsea already had a change in management in mind, but that was why I left and I don't regret my decision.\" </p> <p>Other theories abounded. This afternoon Thome is charged with keeping Chelsea's former Boavista and Leeds striker Jimmy-Floyd Hasselbaink under wraps - a task he has relished whether in Portugal with Benfica or in Yorkshire with Wednesday. During the Brazilian's last days at Chelsea rumour had it that the pair had clashed in training, provoking Thome's abrupt departure. The Chelsea managing director Colin Hutchinson dismissed the incident as \"just a scuffle\", reiterating: \"The only reason Thome left Chelsea was because he was very frustrated at not getting a first-team opportunity.\" </p> <p>\"I've played against Jimmy twice before,\" says the defender. \"He's not the most skilful player ever, but he's strong and he can shoot from wherever. We have to be careful with him, but I'm looking forward to it.\" </p> <p>\"Emerson only had a short time at Chelsea but I know he's still got friends down there. He'll be up for the game and be anxious to do as well as he can,\" said Thome's new manager Peter Reid. </p> <p>Since settling on Wearside, Thome's form has not been helped by Sunderland's shaky start to the new season. But, after five matches unbeaten and a first Premiership clean sheet since he arrived, against Leicester, the Brazilian is steadily making his presence felt. He has even taken the \u00a33.5m Argentine midfielder Julio Arca under his wing, acting as an interpreter for the 19-year-old. </p> <p>\"The first few games with a new club are never easy. You've got to find your feet and adjust to how the team plays,\" he says. \"It takes time to introduce yourself to the squad and to work out what is needed to improve things - that's why I was brought here. </p> <p>\"But I've started to feel a part of it and feel more comfortable and I think it has shown in my performances. The last few games have been better and I'm happy with that. As a defender, if we don't concede a goal I get a lot of pleasure. Of course, I want to win but when the game against Leicester ended goalless I felt a lot of satisfaction when I walked off.\" </p> <p>A repeat of last season's emphatic result this afternoon would cheer both Thome and Reid, although the latter would settle for \"an entertaining, scrambled 1-0 win in the last minute\". Such a scenario would suit Thome as well. </p> <p>\"This is a match I'm really looking forward to,\" he adds. \"It surprises me a bit that Chelsea are not higher in the table, but they did very well against Liverpool recently and I just hope they are not getting things together under the new manager. </p> <p>\"They were not in the best shape before the Liverpool game so maybe that win was a one-off. No one wants to lose a game, especially when it's against your old club, and I'm hoping everyone here has a good day. I'll be sure to let them know it's important beforehand.\"</p>",

He used to be good but he's clearly not any more,'\" he says, smiling. \"Well, here I am and I'm pretty happy, actually.\" </p> <p>When Venables stepped down after Euro 96 the bookies had the then Aston Villa manager rivalling Bryan Robson, Ray Wilkins and Glenn Hoddle for the job. Now even the most optimistic punter would scoff at a flutter on him to replace Kevin Keegan. This afternoon Little will be too busy concentrating on taking Hull to the league's bottom club, Halifax Town, to contemplate his plummet out of the limelight. </p> <p>\"I remember all the speculation, but of course I was tipped to become England coach,\" he says. \"I was at Villa, we'd finished fourth in the Premiership, we'd won the Coca-Cola Cup and got to the semi-final of the FA Cup. I was an up-and-coming English manager doing well. Some people think I must be mad to have walked away from all that; I could have made a lot of money. But I'm not unhappy doing what I'm doing.\" </p> <p>A chart of Little's managerial career shows a startling progression and descent through the leagues - from relegation to the Conference with Darlington, and then winning it the next year followed immediately by the old Fourth Division championship, to promotion to the Premiership with Leicester City.

      "bodyText": "The man once tipped to succeed Terry Venables as England coach is sitting at his desk at Hull City's Boothferry Park, content not to be in contention this time. \"People ask 'Whatever happened to Brian Little? He used to be good but he's clearly not any more,'\" he says, smiling. \"Well, here I am and I'm pretty happy, actually.\" When Venables stepped down after Euro 96 the bookies had the then Aston Villa manager rivalling Bryan Robson, Ray Wilkins and Glenn Hoddle for the job. Now even the most optimistic punter would scoff at a flutter on him to replace Kevin Keegan. This afternoon Little will be too busy concentrating on taking Hull to the league's bottom club, Halifax Town, to contemplate his plummet out of the limelight. \"I remember all the speculation, but of course I was tipped to become England coach,\" he says. \"I was at Villa, we'd finished fourth in the Premiership, we'd won the Coca-Cola Cup and got to the semi-final of the FA Cup. I was an up-and-coming English manager doing well. Some people think I must be mad to have walked away from all that; I could have made a lot of money. But I'm not unhappy doing what I'm doing.\" A chart of Little's managerial career shows a startling progression and descent through the leagues - from relegation to the Conference with Darlington, and then winning it the next year followed immediately by the old Fourth Division championship, to promotion to the Premiership with Leicester City. Silverware at Aston Villa, the club where he made his name as a player, preceded his decline via Stoke City and West Bromwich Albion. \"I probably view management in a different way to others,\" he says. \"I've been at the top, the bottom and the middle; I've been everywhere.

He will be 35 two weeks from today but exhibits the thrill of a child whenever things are going right on the park. Two weeks ago, having poked a free-kick around St Johnstone's wall to score in the less than intoxicating setting of McDiarmid Park, he ran the length of the field in celebration of his feat. For a man who won the European Cup with Marseille in 1993, this seemed bewildering. </p> <p>\"I'm happy with my football these days and I'm proud to be the captain of Hibs,\" says Sauz\u00e9e. \"At my age, at this stage of my life, I wouldn't still be playing unless I was content within myself.\" </p> <p>When he signed for Hibs in October 1999, Sauz\u00e9e agreed to play for a year. Now he is into his second season, and it looks like he will stay for a third. </p> <p>Today he resembles an old warhorse who plays with a certain Gallic flair, but the vestiges of the old Sauz\u00e9e are still very evident. Tall, elegant, with an appetite for the biting tackle, he was a forceful presence in French international teams through a period of the late 1980s and early 1990s, when that team did not otherwise fulfil its rich potential. </p> <p>At club level Sauz\u00e9e has been the happy vagrant. After learning his craft with Sochaux, he moved, still aged only 23, to Marseille, but this first spell with his home-town team was to prove stormy. From Marseille it was along the Cte d'Azur to Monaco in 1990, then back to Marseille for two seasons in 1991, before Serie A and Atalanta Bergamo beckoned in 1993. </p> <p>His dainty feet were employed by Strasbourg and Montpellier before Hibs' siren call 18 months ago. After a stirring decade of action, Sauz\u00e9e has found contentment in Scotland's capital. </p> <p>His first match in the biting atmosphere north of the border could not have been less alluring - against Falkirk at crumbling Brockville Park. \"I remember playing in that match and maybe having 10 touches of the ball in total - the play just went on above my head,\" says Sauz\u00e9e. \"But coming to Hibs has been a great move for me.

      "body": "<p>The international players' union FIFPro announced after a meeting with the European Union competition chief Mario Monti it would have nothing more to to with the task force set up to hammer out proposals to revamp the game's transfer rules until it took players' demands seriously. </p> <p>\"Fifa and the leagues want their education programmes for young players but they're not willing to do anything for 'normal' players over the age of 23,\" the FIFPro secretary general Theo van Seggelen said yesterday.</p> <p>\"We won't speak with the task force any more until they come to us with proposals that are acceptable. Mr Monti assured us the European Commission won't approve any proposal if we're not involved in it too.\"</p> <p>Football's governing bodies set up the task force in an effort to prevent Monti outlawing the current transfer system, which he says breaks European rules on fair competition and abuses workers' rights to freedom of movement. They say banning the current system would throw the game into chaos but, under pressure from the Commission, have pledged to come up with proposals by the end of October to prevent the transfer system being banned.</p> <p>Van Seggelen, who met Monti with the FIFPro President Gordon Taylor and a delegation of players from around Europe, said fears of chaos were exaggerated. \"We don't think anything much will happen to football under a new system. Changes won't influence the game much,\" he said.</p> <p>Fifa has suggested allowing the free movement of players over the age of 24 and ending transfers for players under the age of under-18-year-olds 18, but said clubs should be able to seek compensation for the transfer of players of between 18 and 24.</p> <p>FIFPro, however, believe the plans would discriminate against older players. \"We want to clarify the situation for players of over 23, as to whether they have the possibility to break their contracts. The trouble is that the clubs still think they can make money from the trade in players,\" Van Seggelen said. He said the unions backed the idea of \"transfer windows\" - or limited periods during the year when players could move.</p> <p>Monti's office said in a statement that FIFPro had expressed its disappointment at the lack of progress made by the task force and that the players said they were willing to go to court if their concerns were not taken into account.</p> <p>\"I hope that Fifa, Uefa, the leagues, the clubs and the players will make all efforts possible to arrive at a solution which preserves the specificity of sport while respecting national legislation on contracts, the free circulation of players and EU law,\" the statement quoted Monti as saying.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The international players' union FIFPro announced after a meeting with the European Union competition chief Mario Monti it would have nothing more to to with the task force set up to hammer out proposals to revamp the game's transfer rules until it took players' demands seriously. \"Fifa and the leagues want their education programmes for young players but they're not willing to do anything for 'normal' players over the age of 23,\" the FIFPro secretary general Theo van Seggelen said yesterday. \"We won't speak with the task force any more until they come to us with proposals that are acceptable. Mr Monti assured us the European Commission won't approve any proposal if we're not involved in it too.\" Football's governing bodies set up the task force in an effort to prevent Monti outlawing the current transfer system, which he says breaks European rules on fair competition and abuses workers' rights to freedom of movement. They say banning the current system would throw the game into chaos but, under pressure from the Commission, have pledged to come up with proposals by the end of October to prevent the transfer system being banned. Van Seggelen, who met Monti with the FIFPro President Gordon Taylor and a delegation of players from around Europe, said fears of chaos were exaggerated. \"We don't think anything much will happen to football under a new system. Changes won't influence the game much,\" he said. Fifa has suggested allowing the free movement of players over the age of 24 and ending transfers for players under the age of under-18-year-olds 18, but said clubs should be able to seek compensation for the transfer of players of between 18 and 24. FIFPro, however, believe the plans would discriminate against older players. \"We want to clarify the situation for players of over 23, as to whether they have the possibility to break their contracts. The trouble is that the clubs still think they can make money from the trade in players,\" Van Seggelen said. He said the unions backed the idea of \"transfer windows\" - or limited periods during the year when players could move. Monti's office said in a statement that FIFPro had expressed its disappointment at the lack of progress made by the task force and that the players said they were willing to go to court if their concerns were not taken into account. \"I hope that Fifa, Uefa, the leagues, the clubs and the players will make all efforts possible to arrive at a solution which preserves the specificity of sport while respecting national legislation on contracts, the free circulation of players and EU law,\" the statement quoted Monti as saying.",

As Wilkinson has observed, when people leave the England job \"they take their experience away either in their heads or in cardboard boxes\". Or in Keegan's case a matchbox. </p> <p>If Crozier is true to his words, the FA ought to get it right now. But how easy would this be to apply in the case of a foreign coach, an idea which has steadily gained ground since Keegan's resignation following the defeat by Germany a week ago? </p> <p>Bobby Charlton's objection, that to have a foreigner running the England team would be a disgrace and an insult, can be excused because Charlton represents a time in English football when the idea was not only unthinkable but unnecessary. England had the players and nobody was thinking beyond Alf Ramsey as manager. </p> <p>The notion of having an Italian or a Frenchman in charge of England is a disgraceful reflection on the way that playing standards here have been allowed to wither for the sake of the quick fix of foreign imports while the coaching side has not so much been neglected as allowed to wear blinkers, oblivious to what was needed to keep up with trends abroad. </p> <p>The practical difficulty of appointing a foreign coach is that he would want a back-up staff of compatriots, taking them with him when he left. The situation would be no different from last Sunday, when Wilkinson found himself having to scrape around for assistants because Keegan's coaches, Arthur Cox and Peter Beardsley, were not prepared to stay on even for three more days. </p> <p>Objections to a foreign appointment on xenophobic grounds are not worth a first glance, let alone a second. But should this happen, it would still be a sad reversal of the days when English coaches like Vic Buckingham and, much more recently, Roy Hodgson were thriving abroad. </p> <p>Few will probably remember George Raynor, the Yorkshireman who took Sweden to the 1958 World Cup final. \"Perhaps I am regarded as a freak at home,\" Raynor wrote at the time. His recipe for budding footballers was: \"Never let your skill make you big-headed, keep trying to play football whatever the provocations, and keep off drink and train hard.\" </p> <p>There are some dressing rooms in the Premier League which would regard Raynor as a freak now.</p>",

As Wilkinson has observed, when people leave the England job \"they take their experience away either in their heads or in cardboard boxes\". Or in Keegan's case a matchbox. If Crozier is true to his words, the FA ought to get it right now. But how easy would this be to apply in the case of a foreign coach, an idea which has steadily gained ground since Keegan's resignation following the defeat by Germany a week ago? Bobby Charlton's objection, that to have a foreigner running the England team would be a disgrace and an insult, can be excused because Charlton represents a time in English football when the idea was not only unthinkable but unnecessary. England had the players and nobody was thinking beyond Alf Ramsey as manager. The notion of having an Italian or a Frenchman in charge of England is a disgraceful reflection on the way that playing standards here have been allowed to wither for the sake of the quick fix of foreign imports while the coaching side has not so much been neglected as allowed to wear blinkers, oblivious to what was needed to keep up with trends abroad. The practical difficulty of appointing a foreign coach is that he would want a back-up staff of compatriots, taking them with him when he left. The situation would be no different from last Sunday, when Wilkinson found himself having to scrape around for assistants because Keegan's coaches, Arthur Cox and Peter Beardsley, were not prepared to stay on even for three more days. Objections to a foreign appointment on xenophobic grounds are not worth a first glance, let alone a second. But should this happen, it would still be a sad reversal of the days when English coaches like Vic Buckingham and, much more recently, Roy Hodgson were thriving abroad. Few will probably remember George Raynor, the Yorkshireman who took Sweden to the 1958 World Cup final. \"Perhaps I am regarded as a freak at home,\" Raynor wrote at the time. His recipe for budding footballers was: \"Never let your skill make you big-headed, keep trying to play football whatever the provocations, and keep off drink and train hard.\" There are some dressing rooms in the Premier League which would regard Raynor as a freak now.",

This happens when organisations seek to shed an elitist, upper-middle class image in order to make themselves more representative of the wider population. Both the Civil Service Fast Stream and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office have in recent years targeted career events at lower ranking universities for this reason, and there are signs that this thinking is moving into the private sector. </p> <p>This year, London Guildhall University has managed to attract a number of blue chip names such as KPMG and the BBC to its careers events. \"I think that big companies are beginning to recognise that they are missing good people if they only concentrate on those who have come to higher education through a conventional route,\" says Eric Whittington. </p> <p>\"We have a high proportion of mature students and a diverse ethnic mix which means that half of our students don't have A levels. If a company is using a points-based screening process these student won't get through. But some companies are beginning to realise they need to be more representative of society.\"</p>",

They need to go that little bit further than the candidates from top universities who may let themselves down by thinking they can just walk into a job.\" However, targeting can actually be positive for students at low-ranking universities. This happens when organisations seek to shed an elitist, upper-middle class image in order to make themselves more representative of the wider population. Both the Civil Service Fast Stream and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office have in recent years targeted career events at lower ranking universities for this reason, and there are signs that this thinking is moving into the private sector. This year, London Guildhall University has managed to attract a number of blue chip names such as KPMG and the BBC to its careers events. \"I think that big companies are beginning to recognise that they are missing good people if they only concentrate on those who have come to higher education through a conventional route,\" says Eric Whittington. \"We have a high proportion of mature students and a diverse ethnic mix which means that half of our students don't have A levels. If a company is using a points-based screening process these student won't get through. But some companies are beginning to realise they need to be more representative of society.\"",

But of course, the more skilful skiers may want to spice things up by taking on the challenge of a harder run, thereby increasing the physical demands on their body. </p> <p>Unfortunately, it is often too easy for early intermediate skiers of a certain level (usually males) to use their natural strength to compensate for a lack of technique. Muscling your way down the mountain with brute force is all very well in the short term, but the gradual build-up of fatigue will increase the risk of making a mistake and thereby sustaining an injury. High altitude is another factor that puts unaccustomed stress on the body. </p> <p>So, it is important that fitness is not seen as an alternative to good technique, but as a complement to it; a prerequisite to \"pushing the envelope\", under the guidance of a good instructor. Only then can you experience the enjoyment that will come from improving enough to maybe even ski a glamorous black run, and survive returning in one piece to brag about it in the bar afterwards! </p> <p>Here's a simple, 10-week, 10-point programme to help you gain that fitness between now and Christmas. Try to do it three times per week. The suggested number of repetitions are there as a guide, and how many you complete will obviously depend on your level of fitness at any given point. For those with neither the time nor the money to attend a gym, I should point out that none of the exercises require any special equipment, other than a floor and a chair. </p> <p> 1<strong> Cardio-vascular session: </strong> When exerting yourself in thin air at high altitude, the most important muscle in your body is the heart. You can train it, and improve your blood's oxygen-carrying capacity, with any steady exercise that keeps your heart rate at a constant level, somewhere between roughly 120 and 160 beats per minute. (If your watch has a second hand, just count your pulse for six seconds and multiply by 10.) You can cycle, run or just walk briskly. Start with a 10-minute session, and increase it by 5 minutes every second week. Even just walking up and down stairs instead of using lifts and escalators will help. </p> <p> 2<strong> Dorsal raises: </strong> Lie on your stomach with your arms stretched forwards, and raise hands and feet simultaneously. Or, as a variation, raise your left hand and right foot, then your right hand and left foot. This strengthens your back muscles, which are important \"shock absorbers\" in skiing, especially in moguls. Start with 10 repetitions and add five every two weeks. </p> <p>3 <strong>Abdominal raises:</strong> The stomach muscles are useful in skiing for maintaining good posture, and recovering from any temporary loss of balance. Lie on your back with your knees bent, and slowly curl upwards and forwards to touch your knees. Start with 10 repetitions and add five every two weeks.</p> <p> 4<strong> Knee-bends: </strong> Standing upright, just bend in the knees and ankles, not the waist. (Keeping your arms outstretched in front may help.) Only go as far as a 90-deg bend in the knee joint. Start with 15 repetitions and add five every two weeks. More athletic skiers can switch to doing one-legged knee-bends after six weeks. </p> <p> 5<strong> Triceps dips: </strong> You use your arms more often than you'd think when skiing; every time you push or support yourself with your poles in a lift queue. From a seated position on a chair, straighten your legs and rest them on the ground as far in front as possible. Then, shuffle forward so that your bottom moves off the front of the chair. Now, bend and straighten your arms. Start with five repetitions, and add five every two weeks. </p> <p> 6<strong> Downhill tuck: </strong> Static local muscular endurance is vital for skiing. This exercise is a bit of a \"burner\", but will acclimatise your quadriceps (thigh muscles) to coping with high amounts of lactic acid. Stand with your feet slightly apart, bend your knees until they're at right angles, then bend at the waist so that your chest is just above your thighs and your elbows are just in front of your knees. Keep your head up, looking forward, to strengthen the neck. Start by holding the position for 20 seconds, and add five extra seconds each week. </p> <p> 7<strong> Sideways hip stretch: </strong> Standing with your feet apart and your hands on your hips, gradually bend sideways to the left, leaning further and further over for about 20 seconds. Then repeat to the right. Make sure you're bending in a totally sideways plane. </p> <p> 8<strong> Hamstring stretch: </strong> Put your left foot up on a chair, and with both legs straight, bend forward and try to bring your chin towards your left knee. Start gently at first, and increase the stretch gradually over about 20 seconds. Then repeat with the right leg on the chair. </p> <p> 9<strong> Hip flexor/quadriceps stretch: </strong> Kneel about a yard behind a chair, holding on to the back of the chair with your outstretched hands. Then bring your left foot forward and place it on the ground directly beneath your hands. If you now push your hips forward, you will feel your right hip flexor (at the very top and front of your thigh) stretching. Increase the stretch gradually over 20 seconds. Then switch legs and repeat the process. </p> <p>For a slightly different stretch, namely the quadriceps, go through the same initial movements as above. Then reach behind you with your right hand, grab your right foot, and pull it up so it is close to your right buttock. You should also feel this stretching the front of your thigh, but along the whole length of it. </p> <p> 10<strong> Calf stretch: </strong> Stand on the lowest step of a staircase, facing up the stairs, and place your left foot so that it is half on/half off the step. Then, gradually push your left heel downwards, while still partially supporting your weight with the right leg. Then switch feet. </p> <p>More athletic skiers can start to do two circuits of exercises 2-6 after the sixth week. Exercises 7-10 are for flexibility, and can also be done as a warm-up while on your ski holiday. </p> <p>Always consult your doctor before doing any of these exercises if you suffer from heart or breathing problems, or if you are injured in any way. </p> <p>If you wish to train more seriously, you should consider joining a gym for proper weight training. (An especially useful machine is the \"hamstring curl\"; regular skiers have strong quadriceps, and must strengthen their hamstrings in order to maintain a balanced loading of the knee joint.) Always do a full warm-up before any weight training, and a full stretching session afterwards.</p>",

Disturbingly jagged mountaintops confirm this gothic image, lurching up towards us as the plane tries to settle down to sea level. We are relieved to see the new intercontinental airstrip. </p> <p>Ushuaia nestles along the shore of a glass-surfaced bay on the Beagle Channel, in the lee of the spiky Martial mountains, which rear up dramatically like a backdrop from Dungeons and Dragons. It was a skyline I knew well from the Uttermost Part of the Earth, an inspiring account of life and hardship with the Indians by Lucas Bridges, son of the missionary Thomas Bridges, who in 1870 effectively founded and built Ushuaia - \"the bay penetrating to the west\". The jagged ridge of the Five Brothers and the looming witch's hat of Mount Olivia were old friends. </p> <p>When Darwin passed through here in 1833, he saw the Yamanas, aboriginal shore dwellers living a stark life, half naked and keeping warm with the fires they carried everywhere in their canoes. He thought they were wretched and subhuman. But Thomas Bridges compiled a dictionary of the Yamana language, showing it to be subtle, philosophical and rich in complex imagery. He stopped at 30,000 words, but the Yamana have long since died out from influenza and civilisation. </p> <p>Ushuaia is the most southerly city in the world. The original mission became Argentina's biggest penal colony where many anarchists were sent down from the north. The prisoners made Ushuaia into a city, building whole streets of houses, bridges and even a 15-mile railway. The writer Bruce Chatwin famously couldn't get in when writing In Patagonia, but times have changed. It is now a museum with tasteful life-size figures of anarchist prisoners lurching out of the cells. </p> <p>The nearest thing to a cathedral here is a church with a synthesised Casiotone bell instead of real chimes. But you have to remind yourself that this is a frontier town and as such it still has echoes of the gold rush of a century ago. Nowadays it is at the tourist frontier to Cape Horn and Antarctica and the Gothic mountains and glaciers that lie beyond. </p> <p>Ushuaia runs along a rise on the waterfront. Steep, criss-cross streets move up the hill, like Stanley in the Falklands. Its main street, San Martin, is non-stop shops with no shortage of End of the World and penguin paraphernalia. Downtown Ushuaia is full of cheap whisky; it is a free port and the whole of South America is mad for whisky: bars are called whiskerias; clothes shops have bottles of White Horse wrapped in jeans; newspaper shops with Teacher's poking out among the magazines. </p> <p>Though meat is the heart of Argentine food with plenty of parrillas, meat barbeques, in Ushuaia, it was the rich pickings from the cold Fuegian waters that called. The centolla, the king crab, is a treat. Sweeter and more delicate than our crab, the best we had was in a Ushuaia restaurant called Kaupe (Roca 470, tel: 2901 422704). In a family home up the hill, Ernesto Vivian, an engineer, decided to cook rather than work for the gas company. He cooked so well, with his wife Tessie serving, that they turned their front room into a restaurant. Ernesto does beautiful centolla salad and sea bass en papillote (wrapped in a parchment or foil package). He wouldn't give me the cheap white wine I chose and insisted on serving his best Rutini. </p> <p>On the seafront, Volver (Maipu 37, tel: 42901 23977) serves great seafood surrounded by loads of end-of-the-world bric-a-brac. Down the road, Tia Elvira's (Maipu 349, tel: 2901 424725) is like your old auntie's front room. They have yet more delicious seafood - hake, bass, and others too Spanish to mention. It's all good. </p> <p>This wall-to-wall tourist town has a bewildering number of tour operators offering trips into the mountains or down the Beagle Channel. We took a small boat run by a company called Patagonia Adventure, and it got us right in close to the sea-lion colonies. </p> <p>Clouds of hot breath shot out as the thick-necked males roared like fire eaters at the tourists and the females basked and looked impressed. A colony of cormorants who shared the rocks added a sharp tang. Out in the open, we twitched at wandering albatrosses, skuas, petrels, Antarctic shearbills, delicate winged terns and flightless steamer ducks neurotically paddling full tilt through the water. </p> <p>For trekkers, the moun tains are awesome. They are the jagged end of the Andean dragon's tail, tectonic residues jutting 6,000ft into the sky before sinking into the angry southern seas. You can walk to the spectacular Albino Eye, a glacial lagoon high in the mountains, or the nearby Esmeralda Lake, an unearthly milky-green lake deep among the lurching peaks. </p> <p>The best walk close to town is straight up into the mountains to the Martial glacier, hanging like an apron from a high ridge overlooking the Hebridean blue of the Beagle Channel.

My local GP in the west of Ireland flies over every year to cast a fly. The idea of an Irishman leaving Connemara (a place that most anglers would give their casting arm to visit) to fish at the other end of the earth seems absurd.

Disturbingly jagged mountaintops confirm this gothic image, lurching up towards us as the plane tries to settle down to sea level. We are relieved to see the new intercontinental airstrip. Ushuaia nestles along the shore of a glass-surfaced bay on the Beagle Channel, in the lee of the spiky Martial mountains, which rear up dramatically like a backdrop from Dungeons and Dragons. It was a skyline I knew well from the Uttermost Part of the Earth, an inspiring account of life and hardship with the Indians by Lucas Bridges, son of the missionary Thomas Bridges, who in 1870 effectively founded and built Ushuaia - \"the bay penetrating to the west\". The jagged ridge of the Five Brothers and the looming witch's hat of Mount Olivia were old friends. When Darwin passed through here in 1833, he saw the Yamanas, aboriginal shore dwellers living a stark life, half naked and keeping warm with the fires they carried everywhere in their canoes. He thought they were wretched and subhuman. But Thomas Bridges compiled a dictionary of the Yamana language, showing it to be subtle, philosophical and rich in complex imagery. He stopped at 30,000 words, but the Yamana have long since died out from influenza and civilisation. Ushuaia is the most southerly city in the world. The original mission became Argentina's biggest penal colony where many anarchists were sent down from the north. The prisoners made Ushuaia into a city, building whole streets of houses, bridges and even a 15-mile railway. The writer Bruce Chatwin famously couldn't get in when writing In Patagonia, but times have changed. It is now a museum with tasteful life-size figures of anarchist prisoners lurching out of the cells.

In practice this means developments should be higher density and more akin to the terraces that characterised Georgian and Victorian London than the sprawl associated with Brookside Close and modern suburbia.

      "body": "<p>1 <a href=\"http://www.valdisere.net/index-gb.htm\">Val d'Is\u00e8re/Tignes, France</a><br> There are drawbacks to the place, admittedly. Among them are the uncomfortably large number of other British skiers, long queues for the main access lifts at the start of the day and for some connections at the end of the afternoon. But such is the enormous variety of skiing, to which few other areas can hold a candle, that these seem minor irritations. </p> <p>It has been argued that, depending on one's level of ability, the slopes are all too easy or too difficult, with not enough confidence builders in between for intermediate skiers. Certainly, once you take out the easy green runs, most pistes are a degree or two steeper than those of most resorts. The accomplished skier, however, will find it impossible to exhaust all the options in a week, or perhaps even a fortnight. </p> <p>Tignes is tarting itself up but its architecture is too bleakly functional for it ever to be considered pretty. Val sprawls a bit but has better looks and, with haunts such as the celebrated Dick's Tea Bar, is reckoned to offer the livelier night life. </p> <p>2 <a href=\"http://www.meribel.net/\">M\u00e9ribel, France</a><br> Any resort in the Trois Vall\u00e9es would do. Some would go for the sophistication of Courchevel, some for the altitude of Val Thorens - the highest in Europe. But M\u00e9ribel is arguably the most convenient base from which to roam this vast expanse of ski terrain in the French Savoie. </p> <p>Founded by an Englishman just before the second world war, it has a preponderance of chalets, is somewhat spread out - and also attracts a disproportionately large British clientele. But the skiing compensates. If the Trois Vall\u00e9es finished behind Val d'Is\u00e8re/ Tignes in a vote for the world's finest slopes I'm sure thousands of skiers would be screaming for a recount. </p> <p>The area has 200 lifts and some 375 miles of prepared pistes, but that ignores the many off-piste options. </p> <p>An intermediate can ski for mile upon mile of exercising but unfrightening terrain but there is no shortage of challenges for experts, not least the couloirs (corridors) from Saulire. Some linking runs are very busy and can be unpleasant, but it is always possible to escape the crowds and find some uncluttered snow. </p> <p>3 <a href=\"http://www.ski-arlberg.com//index_en.htm\">St Anton, Austria </a><br>The most impressive skiing in the country. Some runs marked easy blue would rate a trickier red anywhere else, some reds would be black, and its marked, unpisted itineraries and other off-piste options are rarely found in Europe outside the major areas in France. </p> <p>In spring conditions, with a guide who knows where and when the snow will be best, St Anton can set the pulse racing. Yet despite its tough reputation, it is a good option for families with young children because it is always easy on the Valluga side of the valley to ski hard and get back quickly to the nursery slopes. </p> <p>The resort is undergoing a makeover. Generations of skiers have plodded from their hotels to the slopes beneath the railway line which crosses the Arlberg pass but now the track has been diverted to the outskirts. A new gondola lift is being built which could see the demolition of the ageing Kandaharbahn mountain railway. </p> <p>4 <a href=\"http://www.zermatt.ch/index.e.html\">Zermatt, Switzerland</a><br>So infuriatingly inconvenient that it ought not to qualify - yet its unique character keeps it among the elite. Perhaps it is the image of families arriving at hotels for Christmas in horse-drawn sleighs for Christmas, swathed in fur and laden with gifts. Or maybe it is the plethora of great eateries on and off the slopes, or champagne at Elsie's Place, or hotels such as the Monte Rosa, where Winston Churchill stayed and which Edward Whymper used as a base when he set out to climb Zermatt's trademark, the Matterhorn. </p> <p>There are plenty of pluses to make up for the irritation of lift queues and clumping around icy streets in ski boots - and you can avoid that by staying at the new Riffelalp Hotel up on the slopes. </p> <p>The skiing, by the way, is excellent, particularly for intermediates and above, but Zermatt is definitely for those who want more than just a work out on the snow. </p> <p>5 <a href=\"http://www.skitaos.org/index.phtml \">Taos, New Mexico</a><br>Like no other. You can ski all day on perfect snow and drop down to a balmy Rio Grande valley for an outdoor swim among the cacti and sagebrush. </p> <p>The skiing is sensational. When you arrive the first thing you see is Al's Run, named after a doctor who skied it with an oxygen tank after suffering a heart attack. It is so daunting that the management was prompted to post a notice, reassuring the apprehensive that there is easier terrain, too. And so there is, but it is for the steep and bumpy that you remember this mountain. </p> <p>And at night there is always the town of Taos, still a magnet for writers and artists, where Georgia O'Keefe painted and DH Lawrence came hoping the dry air would alleviate his tuberculosis. </p> <p>6 <a href=\"http://www.aspen.com\"> Aspen, Colorado</a> <br>Great skiing, smart hotels, splendid restaurants and shopping - Aspen has it all. With neighbouring Aspen Highlands, Snowmass and Buttermilk all on the same lift ticket, the choice of terrain is enormous. Aspen's Ajax mountain has bump slopes to tax the most rubber-legged. For powderhounds, there is wonderful snowcat skiing in back-country glades. Snowmass has the Big Burn, acknowledged among the longest, widest, most ecstatically enjoyable intermediate runs anywhere. Highlands skiing is rich and varied, while Buttermilk is ideal for beginners and children. </p> <p>Clear your credit card account before you go - but although it has a ritzy image and some unashamedly expensive hotels, Aspen has plenty of more modestly-priced options. As for celebs, it is big enough to swallow them. </p> <p>7 <a href=\"http://www.jacksonhole.com/skiing/index.html\">Jackson Hole, Wyoming</a><br>It is unlikely you will leave without sighting moose. To arrive on a day of bright sunshine and spot one of those ungainly creatures drinking from the glittering, snow banked Snake River, droplets shaking from its disproportionately huge head, leaves an unfading imprint. Skiing back to a condominium, I once encountered a pair of them, grazing on shoots a few yards from the trail. </p> <p>Yet it is for elk that Jackson Hole is best known. The refuge here, established to feed them through the harsh winters, was one of the world's first major conservation projects. </p> <p>Its reputation as a resort for hard skiers is justified by some unnervingly tricky descents. Skiing the Hobacks on a day of leaden skies and fresh powder is hard to beat. And, as in Val d'Is\u00e8re and St Anton, its intermediate skiing provides a consistent challenge. That need not deter those with more modest talents, for there is plenty of easier terrain. Besides, its greatest draws are the remoteness of that broad, flat valley on the edge of Yellowstone National Park. </p> <p>8 <a href=\"http://www.lesarcs.com/\">Les Arcs, France</a><br> Varied is the best way to describe the piste lay out at this purpose-built French resort, which has something for skiers of all standards. Off piste, it can be wonderful, too. </p> <p>Always innovative, this was the resort which introduced ski \u00e9volutif - a method of teaching that involves starting on very short skis and gradually progressing to longer ones - and still offers customers the chance to test their courage on the \"Flying Kilometre\" speed-skiing course, where even first timers can top 85mph. </p> <p>Most visitors stay in apartments, and Les Arcs is not famous for its nightlife, but the sheer convenience of stepping straight from your accommodation on to such excellent slopes is an undeniable bonus. </p> <p>9 <a href=\"http://www.whistler-blackcomb.com/home.html\">Whistler/Blackcomb, British Columbia</a><br> Purists may argue that its nearness to the Pacific sometimes compromises conditions, but even if it is sugary at the bottom the snow is invariably good at the top. Proximity to Vancouver, less than two hours' drive away, certainly means queues and sometimes crowded runs at weekends. But the all-round experience keeps the merged resorts of Whistler and Blackcomb in the premier league. </p> <p>Though their neighbouring mountains are cheek by jowl, you have to return to the bottom to switch between them. However the ski area is vast and full of surprises, boasting long, swooping intermediate confidence builders and tough bowls and couloirs for experts. </p> <p>10 <a href=\"http://www.verbier.ch\">Verbier, Switzerland</a><br>There has never been any question mark against the quality and breadth of Verbier's skiing. Those who know it intimately swear by it. More than 250 miles of marked runs cover four valleys, linking the resort with Thyon, Nendaz and Veysonnaz. A huge network of expert descents provides constant challenge and variety. </p> <p>Verbier classifies almost all its black runs as \"ski itineraries\" which, while they may not be groomed, are skied by such an army of aficionados that they might as well be. They include the notorious and often heavily mogulled Tortin. On top of that, genuine off-piste possibilities are legion. Nor could anyone complain of a lack of restaurants or rocking night spots. </p> <p>Despite all this, however, Verbier was attacked in the 1980s for failure to update lifts which led to long queues. That has changed. Two new gondolas have been built and an electronic, hands-free lift pass introduced. Improvement has been dramatic.</p>",

These range from Elias Canetti and Paul Bowles - who said, without it, Marrakech could be any Moroccan city - to Esther Freudin her novel turned film, Hideous Kinky. </p> <p>But perhaps the most telling word comes from one still living in the medina, Juan Goytisolo - known to the locals as \"the Spaniard\". Hymning the transient life of Djemaa el Fna in his novel Makbara (Serpent's Tail), he scoffs at the contradictory advice fed to tourists; namely to approach in daylight or after nightfall, by stealthy observation from its caf\u00e9 terraces or through a headlong plunge into its perpetual commotion. \"All the guidebooks lie,\" he writes. \"There is simply no way of getting a firm grip on it.\" </p> <p>Less a square than an irregular expanse, abutted by souks and spectacularly backed by the high Atlas mountains, Djemaa el Fna may have been named \"assembly of the dead\" as a place of execution, or \"mosque of nothing\" after an abandoned building plan. But it now draws Marrakchis and strangers alike in a perpetual round of trading, eating and entertainment. </p> <p>Partly for its protean elusiveness, Djemaa el Fna is a compelling spectacle, with a sensory overload of cooking smells and stove smoke, car horns and mesmeric drum beats. Musicians, snake-charmers, acrobats, healers and henna painters compete to beguile onlookers. </p> <p>The culture of the city, founded in the 11th century as a Berber hub, reflects its Arab-African origins, as Berbers mingled with Arabs, Saharan nomads and gnaoua - descendants of sub-Saharan slaves who produce the drumming trance music of the square. While Muslim women in the casbah may still wear the all-enveloping burka, younger ones are to be seen astride mopeds in sleeveless blouses and see-through gauze. </p> <p><strong> What to see</strong><br> </p> <p> Marrakech divides broadly into the still vibrant <strong> medina</strong>, rebuilt under the French protectorate of 1912-56, and the new town of <strong> Gueliz</strong>. The city walls - made of tabia, the red mud of the plains mixed with lime - can be traced in a cal\u00e8che, or pony trap, as part of a two-hour tour (roughly \u00a316). This takes in the palmery, the oasis on which the Berber city was founded,and where stunning sunsets can be enjoyed. </p> <p>The 12th-century <strong> Koutoubia mosque</strong>, just west of Djemaa el Fna, is a towering city landmark deemed the finest Islamic monument in north Africa. </p> <p>Little remains of the city's founding Almoravid dynasty apart from the ruins of a palace beside the Koutoubia. But to the north of the square, amid the labyrinth of souks, is the <strong> Ben Yusuf medersa</strong>, or koranic school, which was largely rebuilt during the 16th- to 17th-century, again with Andalucian influence. (Open 8.30am-noon, 2.30om-6.30pm; 60p). </p> <p>South of Djemaa el Fna, palaces nestle beside the <strong> Mellah</strong>, literally \"salt market\" and once the largest Jewish ghetto in Morocco. It thrived after the 15th-century expulsions from Catholic Spain, but most of the Jewish population left for Casablanca in the last century or emigrated. The quarter remains a place of trade, in everything from TVs to rosewater. </p> <p>The <strong> Saadian El Badi palace</strong>, meaning \"the incomparable\", is also in ruins, but worth seeing for its grandiose scale. (Open 8.30am-noon, 2.30pm-6.30pm; 60p, plus about 60p tip for the guide.) Nearby are the lavishly decorated <strong> Saadian tombs</strong> (same hours and entrance fee). Rediscovered in 1917 and restored under French rule, they have separate men's and women's rooms, and zellij (intricate tiles) on tombs in the open cemetery - they all face east to Mecca, but are occupied by Marrakchi Jews. </p> <p>It is worth a walk through the adjoining casbah, where men sometimes sit outside sewing djellabas (hooded outer garment), while mosharabi , window screens above the doors, allow women to check visitors without being seen. The ubiquitous hand motif on door knockers guards against the evil eye. </p> <p>Back across the Mellah is the late 19th-century <strong> Bahia palace</strong>, which houses the king's retinue on his visits to the city. (Open - unless the king is in town - 8.30am-11.45am and 2.30pm-5.45pm; 60p.) </p> <p>Shaded gardens across the city offer relief from the dry heat. The <strong> Menara</strong> in the south, less a garden than an olive grove for picnickers, has a tranquil reservoir around which Marrakchis gather with ice creams. Most captivating is the <strong> Jardin Majorelle</strong>, north of Gueliz, now owned by Yves Saint Laurent. (Open winter 8am-noon, 2pm-5pm; summer 8am-noon, 3pm-7pm;60p.) Bamboo, palms and giant cacti flourish alongside a lily pond with goldfish, and the cool green is offset by walls and tiles paintedroyal blue. The small <strong> Museum of Islamic Arts</strong> (60p) is also worth a glimpse. </p> <p><strong> The souks</strong><br> </p> <p> Anyone serious about buying a carpet or kilim would do well to get their bearings at <strong> La Maison du Tapis</strong> (7 Derb Baissi, Kasbah), a government co-op where fixed prices mean you can accept a mint tea without undue pressure to buy. </p> <p>Few leave without some ceramics - brightly coloured from Safi, or more subdued from Fes.

There is also a thriving artists' quarter (galleries include the <strong> Gallerie Frederic Damgaard</strong>, Avenue Oqba Ibn Nafiaa) and thuya wood artisans galore. <strong> Afalkay Art</strong> (9 Place My Hassan) is one of several wooden craft shops with fixed prices. </p> <p>Try freshly caught grilled fish in the harbour, or take a table overlooking the sea at <strong> Le Chalet de La Plage</strong> (Boulevard Mohammed V, tel: 475972), for a banquet of oysters (12 for\u00a38) and sardines garnished with coriander (\u00a32.50) - which bear no resemblance to the sad minnows in tins. </p> <p>The <strong> Ourika valley</strong>, a summer haven for better-off Marrakchis, though prone to lethal flash floods, is a grand-taxi ride south past clay-red Berber villages camouflaged amid the foothills.

But by dismissing it so easily, those summit-baggers are missing one of the finest viewpoints not just in the Midlands, but in the whole of Britain. </p> <p>Vincent Waite, author of Shropshire Hill Country, was of the opinion that if you climb no other hill in Shropshire, you must climb the Wrekin. Local writer HW Timperley agreed, reckoning that to the people of Shropshire, the Wrekin was \"as much a spirit as a hill\", and \"when you go to it, the underlying mood or feeling is that of a pilgrimage\". </p> <p>The Wrekin is both the symbol and the icon of the county, in much the same way that the rock formation of the Old Man of the Mountains has become New Hampshire's. If Shropshire had the honour of its own coin, as the New England state recently received, the Wrekin would have to be on it. \"To all friends round the Wrekin\" is still the rousing toast heard among Shropshire folk, and it remains the nostalgic symbol of home for all exiled Salopians. </p> <p>The reason for all this affection for what is, after all, not even the highest summit in this beautiful Border county, is that the Wrekin, which always proudly and significantly carries the definite article, is undoubtedly a hill with a presence. It rises so sharply and unexpectedly from the pastoral Severn Plain that it forces you to notice it. </p> <p>There are few mountains in Britain, let alone hills, that have exerted the same powerful influence or sense of place on its surrounding communities. Perhaps Glastonbury Tor, towering over the willow-dotted Somerset Levels, is the nearest parallel. </p> <p>Geologically speaking, the Wrekin is formed of some of the oldest rocks in Britain, and indeed the world. The lovely, purple-pink and green pastel shades of the Wrekin's Cambrian and Pre-Cambrian rocks go back to the very dawn of the planet, perhaps as much as 2bn years. In the case of the fossil-free Pre-Cambrian, that is before evidence of life itself. </p> <p>The Wrekin takes its name from the British name of the Roman town of Wroxeter, known to the Romans as Viroconium, whose impressive remains lie about five miles to the west. The British people living near here were known as the Wrocensaetan, or the people of the Wrekin, and the earthworks surrounding its airy summit enclose a 20-acre hill fort dating from the Iron Age. You can imagine the Wrocensaetan watching in wonder as the Romans constructed their ruler-straight imperial highway of Watling Street (now the A5) across the lowlands beneath. </p> <p>You expect a hill like the Wrekin to attract its fair share of legends, and you're not disappointed. Perhaps the most popular folk story of its origin involves a wicked Welsh giant (or, in some versions, the Devil) who had a grudge against the people of the county town of Shrewsbury. He set off with a great load of earth with which he intended to dam the River Severn and so flood the town and drown all its inhabitants. </p> <p>On his way, he met a cobbler carrying over his shoulder a sackful of boots to repair, and he asked him directions to Shrewsbury. The cobbler, realising the giant's evil intention, claimed that he'd just walked from Shrewsbury himself, and had worn out his entire load of boots in so doing. The giant groaned in despair and dumped his load of earth where he stood to form the Wrekin. </p> <p>Another legend tells of two warring giants who were building the Wrekin from soil they had dug from the bed of the Severn. They quarrelled and one killed the other, burying him under the northern outlier of Ercall Hill from whence, it is said, he can still be heard groaning at the dead of night. </p> <p>We start our ascent of the Wrekin in the shadow of Ercall Hill, where there is limited lay-by parking at Forest Glen or in the disused quarry on Ercall Lane. Walk south along the lane that links Cluddley and Little Wenlock for about a mile until you see a stile on the right leading by the side of Wenlock Wood towards the wooded eastern slopes of the Wrekin. </p> <p>The woodland path crosses a farm track and eventually you reach a broad forest track which is followed left for about half a mile through avenues of stately beeches around the base of the hill. At a junction of paths at Little Hill, marked by a prominent yew tree, turn right and embark upon the steep climb through the trees directly up the south-western spur of the Wrekin. </p> <p>You will soon emerge from the trees on the broad, stony track formed by those ancient rocks; then head for the obvious rocky outcrop known as the Needle's Eye. Legend has it that this cleft in the rocks was caused when one of those fighting giants threw his spade into the ground. There is a direct route from Eaton Constantine to the summit through this narrow slit, but it is only for the experienced scrambler. </p> <p>You feel like you are on the roof of the Midlands, and the 360-degree view from the summit of the Wrekin, complete with circular toposcope, is breathtaking, said to take in no less than 17 counties. In clear conditions, you should be able to make out the blue outline of the Malvern Hills 40 miles to the south; the neighbouring Shropshire summits of the Clee Hills, wooded Wenlock Edge and the long whaleback of the Long Mynd, fronted by the shark's tooth of Caer Caradoc to the south west; and the misty shapes of the Berwyns, the first hills of Wales, filling the western horizon 30 miles away. Nearer at hand, due south, are the smoking cooling towers and chimney at Buildwas, which stand at the entrance to the Severn Gorge; Coalbrookdale and Iron Bridge, birthplaces of the Industrial Revolution, are just downstream. </p> <p>The well-trodden track now leads gradually down towards the northern end of the hill, passing a radio mast and through first Heaven's Gate and then Hell's Gate, which mark the entrances to the Iron Age hillfort that rings the summit. Significantly perhaps, it is Heaven's Gate which is the narrower. </p> <p>Dropping down off the hill, you descend through the trees of AE Housman's \"forest-fleeced\" Wrekin, past a cottage to return to Ercall Lane. Follow this back to the start near the small reservoir at the foot of Lawrence Hill, the third of the named Wrekin foothills. </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p> The Wrekin lies about five miles west of Telford, on the minor road between Cluddley and Little Wenlock. The walk is about five miles (8km), easy woodland walking, followed by a stiffish climb to the summit. Allow about three hours. The best map is Ordnance Survey 1:50,000 Landranger sheet 127: Stafford and Telford. Recommended pub: The Huntsman in Little Wenlock.

      "body": "<p>The emergence this year of unfamiliar names such as Brian Head and Beitostolen is evidence of the ski industry's unceasing search for \"undiscovered\" resorts. </p> <p><strong> Brian Head</strong>, which makes its debut in Virgin's brochure, is in southern Utah, some four hours' drive from the cluster of resorts - among them <strong> Park City</strong> and <strong> Snowbird</strong> - in the Wasatch Mountains outside Salt Lake City. </p> <p>All but 20% of its marked trails are graded \"easy to intermediate\", although there is a snow cat service to some challenging powder bowls and gullies on Brian Head Park. A potential disadvantage is that the base area, at 9,600ft, is the highest in the state, so going straight there from sea level could leave you short of breath and sleep. A major plus-point in good weather is that you could take time out to visit the astonishing, amphitheatre of translucent stone spires at Bryce Canyon National Park, an hour away by car. </p> <p>Offering holidays to little-known American destinations may look a mite optimistic in a year when the pound has suffered against the dollar, but Brian Head is not the only unfamiliar name in Virgin's programme. There are three in California - <strong> Mount Rose</strong>, which is near Reno, <strong> Big Bear</strong> and <strong> Snow Summit</strong>. It is even offering trips to the Las Vegas Ski and Snowboard Resort at <strong> Lee Canyon</strong>, about 45 minutes from the city. Its base is only around 1,000ft lower than Brian Head's, though the skiing there looks somewhat limited. </p> <p>Montana's <strong> Big Mountain</strong> has made it into a second brochure. Inghams pioneered it, suggesting that customers combine it with <strong> Fernie</strong>, a couple of hours north across the border in Canada's British Columbia. Now Edinburgh-based Ski Independence has launched packages there, too. It has fine runs for all standards, and some of the cheapest snowcat skiing anywhere (latest available price if there are four or more on the cat is $45 a head for four hours of sublime powder in the trees). </p> <p>The magnificent Fernie, which has some of Canada's finest skiing, is rapidly moving from bit part player to centre stage. Crystal is going there for the first time, with one-week self-catering deals starting at \u00a3445. The firm has also introduced its charming neighbour, <strong> Kimberley</strong>. </p> <p>Inghams offers an interesting fresh option in eastern Canada, where you can stay downtown in Quebec City and ski any of three areas - <strong> Mont Sainte Anne</strong>, <strong> Stoneham</strong> or <strong> Le Massif</strong>. None of these is huge by European standardsn but a week at Quebec's imposing Chateau Frontenac, set high above the St Lawrence River, looks good value at a starting price of \u00a3419. </p> <p>Elsewhere, Club Med opens its second Colorado village this winter. Already well established at <strong> Copper Mountain</strong>, it has now added a new 261-room complex at the foot of the slopes of Colorado's <strong> Crested Butte</strong>. Adult one-week prices start at \u00a3679. </p> <p>In Europe, there are signs of a quiet revolution in self catering. Skiers, particularly those who have stayed in large North American condominiums, have become disenchanted with the basic, cramped, egg-box apartments, that are the norm in French purpose-built resorts. </p> <p>One of these, <strong> La Plagne</strong>, is trying to enlarge some of its older units. Meanwhile, new standards are being set by MGM R\u00e9sidences, which opens complexes this season there and in <strong> Chamonix</strong>. The cost for each of four people sharing a two-bedroom unit, booking through MGM R\u00e9sidences' British representative, Erna Low, is from \u00a3177 a head, including ferry crossings. </p> <p>Driving to the Alps, while not quite as popular as some industry optimists claim, is slowly attracting more devotees. Witness the fact that Eurotunnel Motoring Holidays has launched its first programme of ski packages to France - and that self-drive specialist Motours has increased choice in its programme by no fewer than 17 French resorts, including <strong> Les Carroz</strong>, which is linked to the excellent skiing of <strong> Flaine</strong>. </p> <p>Skiing with young children can be frustrating. After a few holidays, they may be able to ski black runs - but short skis make it hard to keep up with adults in a schuss. But there are operators who will provide someone else to stretch those who have started at an early age. Family specialist Ski Esprit will arrange advanced classes in <strong> Courchevel</strong> and <strong> La Rosi\u00e8re</strong> for 7-12 year olds, starting at \u00a3100 for five mornings. </p> <p>And at <strong> Les Gets</strong>, in the enormous Portes du Soleil area on the Franco-Swiss border, Ski Famille will provide a qualified British instructor to take confident kids on \"safari\". Children need to be at least eight, have skied for four weeks, or demonstrate real ability to handle most pistes. The price is \u00a350 for five three-hour morning sessions. </p> <p><strong> Beitostolen</strong> is in Norway, and Thomson Holidays recommends it for families, beginners and low intermediates. Thomson will use new direct charters from Gatwick to Fagernes, about 1hr 30mins from the resort. Customers of Neilson and Crystal will travel on the same flights to <strong> Hemsedal</strong>, only 45 minutes from the airport.</p>",

It is even offering trips to the Las Vegas Ski and Snowboard Resort at Lee Canyon, about 45 minutes from the city. Its base is only around 1,000ft lower than Brian Head's, though the skiing there looks somewhat limited. Montana's Big Mountain has made it into a second brochure. Inghams pioneered it, suggesting that customers combine it with Fernie, a couple of hours north across the border in Canada's British Columbia. Now Edinburgh-based Ski Independence has launched packages there, too. It has fine runs for all standards, and some of the cheapest snowcat skiing anywhere (latest available price if there are four or more on the cat is $45 a head for four hours of sublime powder in the trees). The magnificent Fernie, which has some of Canada's finest skiing, is rapidly moving from bit part player to centre stage. Crystal is going there for the first time, with one-week self-catering deals starting at \u00a3445. The firm has also introduced its charming neighbour, Kimberley. Inghams offers an interesting fresh option in eastern Canada, where you can stay downtown in Quebec City and ski any of three areas - Mont Sainte Anne, Stoneham or Le Massif. None of these is huge by European standardsn but a week at Quebec's imposing Chateau Frontenac, set high above the St Lawrence River, looks good value at a starting price of \u00a3419. Elsewhere, Club Med opens its second Colorado village this winter. Already well established at Copper Mountain, it has now added a new 261-room complex at the foot of the slopes of Colorado's Crested Butte. Adult one-week prices start at \u00a3679. In Europe, there are signs of a quiet revolution in self catering. Skiers, particularly those who have stayed in large North American condominiums, have become disenchanted with the basic, cramped, egg-box apartments, that are the norm in French purpose-built resorts. One of these, La Plagne, is trying to enlarge some of its older units. Meanwhile, new standards are being set by MGM R\u00e9sidences, which opens complexes this season there and in Chamonix. The cost for each of four people sharing a two-bedroom unit, booking through MGM R\u00e9sidences' British representative, Erna Low, is from \u00a3177 a head, including ferry crossings. Driving to the Alps, while not quite as popular as some industry optimists claim, is slowly attracting more devotees. Witness the fact that Eurotunnel Motoring Holidays has launched its first programme of ski packages to France - and that self-drive specialist Motours has increased choice in its programme by no fewer than 17 French resorts, including Les Carroz, which is linked to the excellent skiing of Flaine. Skiing with young children can be frustrating. After a few holidays, they may be able to ski black runs - but short skis make it hard to keep up with adults in a schuss. But there are operators who will provide someone else to stretch those who have started at an early age. Family specialist Ski Esprit will arrange advanced classes in Courchevel and La Rosi\u00e8re for 7-12 year olds, starting at \u00a3100 for five mornings. And at Les Gets, in the enormous Portes du Soleil area on the Franco-Swiss border, Ski Famille will provide a qualified British instructor to take confident kids on \"safari\". Children need to be at least eight, have skied for four weeks, or demonstrate real ability to handle most pistes. The price is \u00a350 for five three-hour morning sessions. Beitostolen is in Norway, and Thomson Holidays recommends it for families, beginners and low intermediates. Thomson will use new direct charters from Gatwick to Fagernes, about 1hr 30mins from the resort. Customers of Neilson and Crystal will travel on the same flights to Hemsedal, only 45 minutes from the airport.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Harold Pinter was 70 this week. The occasion was marked by his publisher, Faber and Faber, who threw a party at which they genuinely surprised him. They presented him with a new book, Harold Pinter: A Celebration, comprising essays by friends and colleagues that brim with anecdotes, impressions and recollections which go some way towards explaining Pinter's creative durability. </p> <p>\"The old bull surges on,\" writes his friend Henry Woolf: it's a good image. Though we can all think of exceptions such as Goethe, Shaw and Miller, most dramatists by 70 are either dead, quiescent or exhausted. Writing plays is a cruelly draining business in that it depends upon life experience, which tends to thin out once the dramatist has achieved celebrity. Pinter, however, has kept body and soul in good repair. </p> <p>What comes out of the book is Pinter's blend of English and European traditions. Simon Gray perceptively relates him to Dickens. But David Hare also sharply observes, \"he was a man who had read and absorbed European ideas and who wanted to explode them, with a terrifying bang, into English working-class settings\".</p> <p>That seems to me precisely true. In The Birthday Party you feel the spirit of Kafka has descended on a crummy English seaside town. In a work like The Hothouse, set in a sinister state-run institution, Sartre meets music-hall cross-talk. I even remember the German director Peter Zadek saying to me, when he directed Moonlight in Berlin, that it was like \"a mixture of Beckett and Agatha Christie\". </p> <p>Pinter's plays are profoundly English yet also linked, through his reading and Jewish ancestry, to the cross-currents of European history. That in itself raises the thorny issue of Pinter's politics. The kind of overtly political plays Pinter has been writing since 1985 - specifically One for the Road, Mountain Language, Party Time and Ashes to Ashes - are often treated in Britain with patronising condescension if not downright hostility. His articles and speeches on political issues are given even scanter consideration: they are often seen as symptoms of the angry playwright sounding off.

      "bodyText": "Harold Pinter was 70 this week. The occasion was marked by his publisher, Faber and Faber, who threw a party at which they genuinely surprised him. They presented him with a new book, Harold Pinter: A Celebration, comprising essays by friends and colleagues that brim with anecdotes, impressions and recollections which go some way towards explaining Pinter's creative durability. \"The old bull surges on,\" writes his friend Henry Woolf: it's a good image. Though we can all think of exceptions such as Goethe, Shaw and Miller, most dramatists by 70 are either dead, quiescent or exhausted. Writing plays is a cruelly draining business in that it depends upon life experience, which tends to thin out once the dramatist has achieved celebrity. Pinter, however, has kept body and soul in good repair. What comes out of the book is Pinter's blend of English and European traditions. Simon Gray perceptively relates him to Dickens. But David Hare also sharply observes, \"he was a man who had read and absorbed European ideas and who wanted to explode them, with a terrifying bang, into English working-class settings\". That seems to me precisely true. In The Birthday Party you feel the spirit of Kafka has descended on a crummy English seaside town. In a work like The Hothouse, set in a sinister state-run institution, Sartre meets music-hall cross-talk. I even remember the German director Peter Zadek saying to me, when he directed Moonlight in Berlin, that it was like \"a mixture of Beckett and Agatha Christie\". Pinter's plays are profoundly English yet also linked, through his reading and Jewish ancestry, to the cross-currents of European history. That in itself raises the thorny issue of Pinter's politics. The kind of overtly political plays Pinter has been writing since 1985 - specifically One for the Road, Mountain Language, Party Time and Ashes to Ashes - are often treated in Britain with patronising condescension if not downright hostility. His articles and speeches on political issues are given even scanter consideration: they are often seen as symptoms of the angry playwright sounding off. But I would argue that Pinter's political works are a crucial part of his oeuvre and the source of his continuing vitality: at an age when most artists withdraw into private life, Pinter is impelled by a moral rage at injustice, cruelty and hypocrisy. Numerous arguments are raised against Pinter's political plays. One is that they stem from a position of certainty, whereas good drama is fuelled by doubt. It is true that Nietzsche said \"convictions are prisons\" but it is historical nonsense to suggest that drama can only exist in an ideological vacuum: from Aristophanes to Arthur Miller, playwrights have written out of moral passion. What lifts Pinter's plays above the simplicities of agit-prop is that they imaginatively occupy enemy territory: Nicolas, the agent of state repression in One for the Road, is an extraordinary creation in that he is both a vicarious torturer and yet a man who seeks validation from his victims. It is not that Pinter sees both sides of the argument: what he presents us with is the vulnerability of power. Another stock objection - raised only last week in a fierce debate on Radio 4's Front Row - is that Pinter depicts Britain as a totalitarian state: in Party Time, a cocktail party is accompanied by street round-ups, and in Ashes to Ashes, Dorset is invoked in the context of mass destruction. But this is based on a lazy misreading of the plays. Nowhere does Pinter state or even suggest that modern Britain is morally equivalent to Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia. What he does do, by the use of local references, is to shock us out of our smug assumption that western democracies are exemplars of virtue or that repressive regimes have a monopoly on evil.

Among many incredible stories, Father Glynn told me about communities who prided themselves on their ability to lure 10ft sharks into their canoes. </p> <p>I didn't altogether believe him. But recently I read the journals of Abel Tasman, the Dutch explorer who discovered Tasmania. In the middle of descriptions of cannibals and headhunters, he mentioned of a band of New Guineans catching a very large shark, armed with just a club and a leaky canoe. And this was in 1642. </p> <p>I was hooked. And so, eager to find out more, I set off for New Ireland, via Manila and Port Moresby. After two days on planes and eight hours of bumping along dusty plantation roads, I arrived in the middle of the night in Kontu, home of the shark callers of New Ireland. </p> <p>And what a welcome. All the children of the community (about 300 of them) crowded around me. Out of nowhere, came a dinner of rice and taro. I was serenaded with a selection of local songs as I sat under a tropical sky so filled with stars that I felt I was inside a huge colander with a torch shining through. </p> <p>I spent the night inside the village \"hausboy\" - the communal sleeping place for all single males - and there I lay, metres from the rolling sea, my sleep disturbed only by a recurring dream in which I was savagely ripped apart underwater. </p> <p>The next day, I was introduced to Selam Kirisibe, reputedly the greatest shark caller of our time. He was a soft-spoken, wiry man of 55 with a permanent bright red smile, his teeth stained by years of chewing betel nut. He had caught more than 150 sharks, and all this battling had given him the physique of a 20-year-old. </p> <p>He agreed to take me out and teach me the \"ways of the shark\", for a fee. This was not a tourist rip off - all the shark-callers of Kontu had, at one point, paid an elder for \"the knowledge\". No fee, no magic. My initiation began straight away. </p> <p>I was first taught about what I must not do. Shark callers have to be male. They cannot eat wild pig or crayfish, nor accept any food from the hand of a fertile woman for 24 hours before the excursion. They must take care not to step on any excrement lying on the beach. And they cannot have sex. The shark is a wily animal, I was told, and will smell you have been up to no good. </p> <p>The seas were full of silvertips, great reef, black tips, hammerheads and tiger sharks. But it was the mako shark that the caller wanted, because the community believed that the spirits of the ancestors resided in its body. And it was calling their ancestors that caused the shark to come. </p> <p>To awaken the spirits, the caller anoints himself and his canoe with secret herbs. Then he paddles out to the reef and symbolically spears the coral to arouse the spirit of Moro - the shark god. This done, he takes out a larung, a rattle fashioned out of bamboo and coconut shells, and begins shaking it in the sea. Finally, he chants the age-old songs of the shark. If the shark answers the call, the hunter entices it to the side of his canoe and, softly stroking it, slips a loop of vine over its head.Then he clubs it to death. </p> <p>After two days of learning the ritual, I was eager to set off, but Selam told me that the sharks would not come until the sea had calmed. </p> <p>Then, one morning, he woke me before dawn to say that the waves had settled and the two of us walked down to the beach . After wiping everything with the special herbs, we dragged our sleek brown canoes into the ocean and set off. </p> <p>We pushed outwards in silence: the only sound was the slapping of the waves on the hull. About 2km offshore, Selam placed his oar to one side, and began rattling his coconut husks. I joined in, and for the next 10 minutes we sat, gently rocking, with the dawn lighting up the coastline. </p> <p>Selam began to sing a soft, melancholy tune that drifted over the waves. He paused and nodded to me to follow suit. I complied, self-consciously, and we sang in unison for half an hour, the coconuts dipping into the clear water, our voices filling the morning air. </p> <p>Suddenly, I saw Selam tense. And there it was - an 8ft grey-backed mako shark, rising from the deep and gliding in a long, slow circling motion up to our canoes. Its whole body exuded a graceful menace. </p> <p>I was filled with a sudden panic. After all, a canoe is not the most stable of vessels, and I wasn't the most confident of oarsmen. But the shark did not seem agitated by our calling - just curious. </p> <p>He swam lazily between us for about three minutes, swishing his tail elegantly back and forth. I had asked Selmen not to kill the shark, so we sat and watched this wild creature at ease in its own kingdom. Then, just as quickly as it had arrived, the shark slunk off, leaving us alone once more. Why it answered our call is a mystery. Some experts say that the noise of the coconut rattle in the water mimics the sound of an injured fish. Others say that the sharks are just curious. </p> <p>That week, we tried four more times to call up a shark, but each time the rain pushed us back to shore as the sea grew restless.

      "body": "<p>When Russell Griffiths arrived at the University of Lincolnshire and Humberside in September 1998 he seemed a pretty cool kind of guy. In his first lecture, he stood up and said \"I'm sure you are as hung over as I am\". After five minutes of teaching, he said: \"Let's just all go back to bed.\"</p> <p>For the 18-year-olds in front of him this was a bit of a laugh. Here they were, fresh out of school and this bloke was swearing in class and encouraging them to bunk off. For a while, they would say \"Russ rocks\" and get a bit of a kick out of him appearing in pubs and buying them drinks.</p> <p>But it was not long before students on Griffiths' course began saying other things about the 36-year-old lecturer. His teaching was erratic and often he would just read out from a textbook rather than prepare a lecture. Then there was the way he would stare at women's breasts, ask them if they had boyfriends and make inappropriate comments.</p> <p>Last Tuesday, Griffiths was acquitted of the rape of one of his 18-year-old students. A jury of six men and six women concluded that his claim that he and the student had been having a three-month relationship and that she consented to sex was true. After its verdict the jury was told that Griffiths had a history of stalking, harassing and humiliating former lovers and that he had a criminal record for it.</p> <p>They discovered he had lied to his employers about his past. And they learned that he kept a little black book of his conquests entitled the Sexual History of Russell Griffiths, containing details of the 90 women he claims to have slept with.</p> <p>Now that the court case is over and Griffiths faces a custodial sentence after he admitted charges of obtaining financial advantage by deception - by signing a de claration that he had no criminal convictions - a picture of him as a serious sexual predator has emerged.</p> <p>It has shocked university authorities who find themselves vulnerable to a lack of legislation which would force staff to reveal their criminal past. Now universities and student unions are urging the government to address the situation. Student leader Verity Coyle said she would launch a campaign to ensure that lecturers undergo the same rigorous checks for criminal history as teachers and social workers.</p> <p>Russell Griffiths was born in Swansea, and studied at a local comprehensive school and later at the city's university. He marriedand had a daughter, and left the two more than 10 years ago. He went on to become involved in a number of relationships - with at least two ending in obsessive behaviour on Griffiths' part.</p> <p>In 1995, Griffiths was given a two year suspended sentence after putting up a poster of a naked former lover in the hospital where she worked.</p> <p>He was convicted of making threats, making obscene communications and criminal damage. In 1996, he was again found guilty of sending obscene communications. Described by his solicitor at the time as \"a very intense young man\", Griffiths had persuaded his fiancee to pose for sexually explicit photographs and when they split up he sent them to her mother, to her ex-boyfriend, and to the university, along with claims that she had been sleeping with lecturers to boost her grades.</p> <p>Griffiths' true background only became clear to the university when a colleague complained to police. Police checks discovered the lecturer's history and a panic alarm was fitted in the female colleague's home.</p> <p>It was not until he had resigned from the university and applied for a reference for a teaching post at another university, that distinct steps were taken to inform pupils that he could be a danger. A week or so after the new term began, the alleged rape victim came forward to Deborah Wilson, another course lecturer. She said that Griffiths had drugged her drink at a disco, taken her home, and had sex with her without her consent.</p> <p>Griffiths' sexual diary marked women's performance out of 10 and had features such as \"best technique\", \"best feature\", \"likes/turn-ons\" and \"what we did.\" Some of the entries were accompanied by explicit photographs.</p> <p>Since he was charged, women associated with Griffiths have spoken of his behaviour. One, Claire Wilkinson, told the Daily Star that she slept with Griffiths at his flat after she went to talk to him about her worries over an essay. She said: \"He led me to his bedroom where he sat on the edge of the bed and talked. I asked if I'd pass and he said 'Yes'. But he failed me.\"</p> <p>Deborah Wilson, a fellow lecturer, said: \"One girl said she was so scared she locked herself in her room for three days and wouldn't go out.\" Yesterday, as students on the university campus mulled over the jury's verdict and watched as the alleged victim got on with her classes, they shook their heads.</p> <p>One woman whom he taught, Lucy Titterington, said: \"It's surprising how many girls who he made suggestive remarks to have come forward. He would turn up at the balls. We knew and took advantage of the fact that he would buy us drinks.</p> <p>\"At one ball he bought me a drink and said that with his personal help I could get very far. He said I was one of the most attractive, intelligent girls that he was teaching. I just thought 'Oh no', this personal help bit was not right. I didn't realise he was using that particular line on everyone else. My friend said he said it to her.\"</p> <p>Another student said: \"I had been doing some work experience in the marketing department and I went to Russell for a bit of advice. He said 'You are going to come across problems all your life because you are tall, attractive and have a big bust'. It was just the way he looked at you, penetrating your eyes. It was totally horrible. And now everyone's feeling a bit naive. Teachers are meant to be safe.\"</p>",

After its verdict the jury was told that Griffiths had a history of stalking, harassing and humiliating former lovers and that he had a criminal record for it. They discovered he had lied to his employers about his past. And they learned that he kept a little black book of his conquests entitled the Sexual History of Russell Griffiths, containing details of the 90 women he claims to have slept with. Now that the court case is over and Griffiths faces a custodial sentence after he admitted charges of obtaining financial advantage by deception - by signing a de claration that he had no criminal convictions - a picture of him as a serious sexual predator has emerged. It has shocked university authorities who find themselves vulnerable to a lack of legislation which would force staff to reveal their criminal past. Now universities and student unions are urging the government to address the situation. Student leader Verity Coyle said she would launch a campaign to ensure that lecturers undergo the same rigorous checks for criminal history as teachers and social workers. Russell Griffiths was born in Swansea, and studied at a local comprehensive school and later at the city's university. He marriedand had a daughter, and left the two more than 10 years ago. He went on to become involved in a number of relationships - with at least two ending in obsessive behaviour on Griffiths' part. In 1995, Griffiths was given a two year suspended sentence after putting up a poster of a naked former lover in the hospital where she worked. He was convicted of making threats, making obscene communications and criminal damage. In 1996, he was again found guilty of sending obscene communications. Described by his solicitor at the time as \"a very intense young man\", Griffiths had persuaded his fiancee to pose for sexually explicit photographs and when they split up he sent them to her mother, to her ex-boyfriend, and to the university, along with claims that she had been sleeping with lecturers to boost her grades. Griffiths' true background only became clear to the university when a colleague complained to police. Police checks discovered the lecturer's history and a panic alarm was fitted in the female colleague's home. It was not until he had resigned from the university and applied for a reference for a teaching post at another university, that distinct steps were taken to inform pupils that he could be a danger. A week or so after the new term began, the alleged rape victim came forward to Deborah Wilson, another course lecturer. She said that Griffiths had drugged her drink at a disco, taken her home, and had sex with her without her consent. Griffiths' sexual diary marked women's performance out of 10 and had features such as \"best technique\", \"best feature\", \"likes/turn-ons\" and \"what we did.\" Some of the entries were accompanied by explicit photographs. Since he was charged, women associated with Griffiths have spoken of his behaviour. One, Claire Wilkinson, told the Daily Star that she slept with Griffiths at his flat after she went to talk to him about her worries over an essay. She said: \"He led me to his bedroom where he sat on the edge of the bed and talked. I asked if I'd pass and he said 'Yes'. But he failed me.\" Deborah Wilson, a fellow lecturer, said: \"One girl said she was so scared she locked herself in her room for three days and wouldn't go out.\" Yesterday, as students on the university campus mulled over the jury's verdict and watched as the alleged victim got on with her classes, they shook their heads. One woman whom he taught, Lucy Titterington, said: \"It's surprising how many girls who he made suggestive remarks to have come forward. He would turn up at the balls. We knew and took advantage of the fact that he would buy us drinks. \"At one ball he bought me a drink and said that with his personal help I could get very far. He said I was one of the most attractive, intelligent girls that he was teaching. I just thought 'Oh no', this personal help bit was not right. I didn't realise he was using that particular line on everyone else. My friend said he said it to her.\" Another student said: \"I had been doing some work experience in the marketing department and I went to Russell for a bit of advice. He said 'You are going to come across problems all your life because you are tall, attractive and have a big bust'. It was just the way he looked at you, penetrating your eyes. It was totally horrible. And now everyone's feeling a bit naive. Teachers are meant to be safe.\"",

As one diplomat put it: \"Nothing much happened.\"</p> <p>Despite constant Conservative party sniping before the summit, British ministers in Biarritz insisted that a veto on the draft charter of rights - as urged by the opposition - was unnecessary.</p> <p>Instead, Mr Blair's minister for Europe, Keith Vaz, played down the charter's significance yesterday by comparing it to the most unlikely of publications: the Beano.</p> <p>Despite admitting on Thursday that \"all courts will draw upon and look at any documents\" when reaching judicial decisions, he said yesterday: \"People will be able to bring it up in the European Court of Justice just as if it was the Beano.\"</p> <p>Unflattering as that may be, the comparison with a comic has brought pro-Europeans and Eurosceptics into agreement. Thought the charter does not have the force of law like a formal EU treaty, the rivals agree that it is \"part of the process of federalising the EU\" by pushing rights into the EU court of justice's jurisdiction.</p> <p>Mr Blair is not alone in fearing the 54-clause charter, which, after months of wrangling, is due to be agreed at the full Nice summit in December. In yesterday's talks on future reforms, he also confirmed that Britain was filling to reduce its seats on the European commission from two to one.</p> <p>That change is designed to cut commission numbers to manageable proportions as the EU expands south and east. Even the British Conservatives concede that, eventually, no state may be able to have an automatic right to a commissioner.</p> <p>In return, larger states, led by Germany, want more votes on the EU's Council of Ministers to reflect their importance - a move that alarms smaller members.</p> <p>But Labour and at least three other states remain reluctant to concede much ground on a big core issue -- France's suggested streamlining plan, qualified majority voting (QMV). Britain will not abandon its national veto over taxes, social security, defence or future treaty changes, in favour of QMV.</p> <p>Even so, France's minister for Europe, Pierre Moscovici, maintained that \"There is a generally favourable trend on half of the topics to be decided by QMV\".</p> <p>The summit is expected to endorse modest moves towards internal EU reforms aimed at cohesion and effectiveness in EU bodies.</p> <p>But on the rights charterm the Conservatives remained adamant: \"This document is a superstate charter. It will be a major burden on business and a major bind on our independence,\" Francis Maude, the shadow foreign secretary, said yesterday. \"It will give unelected EU judges the rights to impose laws on Britain. This superstate charter must be vetoed.\"</p> <p>There is a real cultural conflict between the traditions of European law and English common law, with the former allowing judges to decide what a treaty or law was intended to achieve while the latter requires them to stick more closely to the text.</p> <p>Eurosceptic claims that the charter will boost the right to strike, protect gay marriage and merely \"respect\" rather than \"guarantee\" press freedom, may seem far-fetched but as Anthony Duff, a Liberal Democrat MEP and expert on treaty law, has said, the consequence of installing the charter is part of the federalising process. \"I think everyone apart from the Brits seems to be quite clear about that,\" he said.</p>",

As one diplomat put it: \"Nothing much happened.\" Despite constant Conservative party sniping before the summit, British ministers in Biarritz insisted that a veto on the draft charter of rights - as urged by the opposition - was unnecessary. Instead, Mr Blair's minister for Europe, Keith Vaz, played down the charter's significance yesterday by comparing it to the most unlikely of publications: the Beano. Despite admitting on Thursday that \"all courts will draw upon and look at any documents\" when reaching judicial decisions, he said yesterday: \"People will be able to bring it up in the European Court of Justice just as if it was the Beano.\" Unflattering as that may be, the comparison with a comic has brought pro-Europeans and Eurosceptics into agreement. Thought the charter does not have the force of law like a formal EU treaty, the rivals agree that it is \"part of the process of federalising the EU\" by pushing rights into the EU court of justice's jurisdiction. Mr Blair is not alone in fearing the 54-clause charter, which, after months of wrangling, is due to be agreed at the full Nice summit in December. In yesterday's talks on future reforms, he also confirmed that Britain was filling to reduce its seats on the European commission from two to one. That change is designed to cut commission numbers to manageable proportions as the EU expands south and east. Even the British Conservatives concede that, eventually, no state may be able to have an automatic right to a commissioner. In return, larger states, led by Germany, want more votes on the EU's Council of Ministers to reflect their importance - a move that alarms smaller members. But Labour and at least three other states remain reluctant to concede much ground on a big core issue -- France's suggested streamlining plan, qualified majority voting (QMV). Britain will not abandon its national veto over taxes, social security, defence or future treaty changes, in favour of QMV. Even so, France's minister for Europe, Pierre Moscovici, maintained that \"There is a generally favourable trend on half of the topics to be decided by QMV\". The summit is expected to endorse modest moves towards internal EU reforms aimed at cohesion and effectiveness in EU bodies. But on the rights charterm the Conservatives remained adamant: \"This document is a superstate charter. It will be a major burden on business and a major bind on our independence,\" Francis Maude, the shadow foreign secretary, said yesterday. \"It will give unelected EU judges the rights to impose laws on Britain. This superstate charter must be vetoed.\" There is a real cultural conflict between the traditions of European law and English common law, with the former allowing judges to decide what a treaty or law was intended to achieve while the latter requires them to stick more closely to the text. Eurosceptic claims that the charter will boost the right to strike, protect gay marriage and merely \"respect\" rather than \"guarantee\" press freedom, may seem far-fetched but as Anthony Duff, a Liberal Democrat MEP and expert on treaty law, has said, the consequence of installing the charter is part of the federalising process. \"I think everyone apart from the Brits seems to be quite clear about that,\" he said.",

The celebrated author transforms himself, with a showman's pass, into a city of memory. Proceeding by a series of recognitions, he dowses for the qualities that have defined and sustained a career of heroic endeavour. He has set himself to know everything that is to be known about an unknowable mass: a history that is used up, a Falstaffian past that overwhelms an anorexic present. </p> <p>Sensing that this is no longer a period for carefully contrived fictions, Ackroyd has returned to the material that inspired those fictions: fires, frauds, magicians, architects and emblematic children. All the contrary currents of London life are on display, the grand spectacles and sacrifices that have animated a fabulous 20-year project. Ackroyd had maintained a gold-top literary profile by ventriloquising the dead - Blake, Wilde, Dickens, Eliot, Thomas More. Now it is time for a more demanding form of necromancy: the biographer must transcribe the last testament of the metropolitan corpse, a zone of \"weariness and lassitude\" staggering on the cusp of a new millennium. </p> <p> London: The Biography - Ackroyd risks the hubris of the definite article - is an epic of celebration and assimilation, the absorption of libraries, the navigation of maps, the accessing of half-forgotten voices. But on the very day that this unimaginable labour was completed (the text running to 30 or so pages more than James Joyce's Ulysses ), its author suffered a heart attack. The whole metaphor, city as body, was clearly getting out of hand. </p> <p>London (the corporeal entity) is unforgiving towards those who seek to explain and exploit its mysteries. Ackroyd writes, with a shiver of sympathy, of the 18th-century geographer Richard Horwood, whose huge map \"contained street numbers as well as names and houses\". The compulsion to achieve a pictorial equivalent of the city, a picture that would rival reality and keep pace with growth, broke its maker. Exhausted, Horwood died at the age of 45, four years after the publication of his masterpiece. </p> <p>Ackroyd's vision is resolutely retrospective. We, his contempo raries, are the pale residue of a dying fire. There is nothing to be done, beyond listing and cataloguing, breaking open dead files. \"In London,\" he writes, \"the past is a form of occluded memory, in which the presence of earlier generations is felt rather than seen. It is an echoic city, filled with shadows.\" His book moves, among wraiths and instances of memento mori, through a chronology of founding and naming, settlement and development: highlighting virtues and voices, the attributes particular to this place. </p> <p>Unpersuaded by the \"fantasies of latter-day psychogeographers\", Ackroyd acknowledges London as a crucible of myth; King Lud gazes out on the mystagogue EO Gordon's sacred mounds. From vaporous Celtic origins, druids and shamen, his narrative drifts in leisurely paragraphs across a heritage recovered from dusty files. Above everything, there is this infernal acoustic babble, an unmediated chaos of competing church bells, street vendors, \"roaring boy\" apprentices, from which he sifts meaning. It is as if, in treating London as a glorious fiction, he is remembering, rather than uncovering and disclosing. Passages of social discourse are spliced by reveries, by post-traumatic dreams, recalling and reviving things that made London the only place in which the author would choose to live. </p> <p>Looking back, summarising, quoting from earlier witnesses - from Orwell and Virginia Woolf, De Quincey and the anonymous author of the medieval poem London Lickpenny , which becomes the title of his own first pamphlet of verse - Ackroyd reveals what so much research, so many years of wandering the city, have granted him. His book becomes a lecture, a performance. He speaks with affection of disregarded oases, Clerkenwell Green, Coram's Fields, Fountain Court in the Temple. He digresses, offers swift rhapsodies on food, drink, clubs, weather, graffiti: monologues of pleasure, sensual fugues. There are whispers of a secret self, previously unconfessed, unrevealed in any of the novels. Playing Boswell to London's Johnson, Ackroyd is liberated; by oblique strokes, he can reactivate the dangerous fantasies of his published fiction. \"This is not a true story,\" he writes at the conclusion of his first novel, The Great Fire of London , \"but certain things follow from other things.\" </p> <p>An impresario of smoky effects, Ackroyd pulls back the curtain to show us the treasures in his personal cabinet of curiosities: the great and the good, the infamous, the freakish, the criminal. Editing an impossibly plural landscape, he decides, like his mentor Dickens, to service a cult of celebrity. This is London as a picaresque exhibition, a freak show of the notable and the notorious; pearly incidents of sentiment set against the encroaching darkness. </p> <p>His judgments are characteristically generous: \"greatness\" is bestowed as lightly as the trinkets in Harold Wilson's honours list. There are great fires, plagues, storms. London is built on a genealogy of greatness. William Blake is the \"great London mythographer\". John Stow, the \"great 16th-century historian\". Sir Laurence Gomme, \"a great administrative historian\". John Wilkes, \"the great populist and demagogue\". John Dee, \"the great Elizabethan magus of Mortlake\". Nicholas Hawksmoor, \"the great builder of London churches\". </p> <p>But the parade has passed us by. Beneath Ackroyd's mellifluous prose, the glitter of paste jewels and gorgeous robes, the sponsor's message is profoundly conservative. Poll-tax riots and uprisings at Broadwater Farm Estate are coeval with the burning of Newgate Prison: they are virtual-reality panoramas from the Museum of London.

      "bodyText": "Turkey is demanding a full say in future military operations mounted by the European Union, in a dispute which threatens to disrupt moves to set up a European rapid reaction force, a key issue on the EU's agenda. The plan, now well advanced, is to establish a joint European military force of more than 60,000 troops to intervene in international crises where Nato as a whole - notably the US - does not want to get involved. France wants to crown its six-month presidency of the EU with an agreement on the ambitious plan at a summit in Nice in early December. The EU says it would consult non-member Nato countries such as Turkey but final decisions would be up to the EU and the EU alone. At a private meeting of Nato defence ministers in Birmingham this week, the Turkish minister, Sabahattin Cakmakoglu, was said by one of his officials to have insisted on \"full and equal participation in all decision-making\" about EU military operations in Europe. \"The EU cannot be the main organisation responsible for the security of Europe,\" the official told the Guardian. Turkey, he added, could not accept second-class status. This tough line partly reflects Ankara's deep resentment that while it is an important Nato power, its application for full EU membership is not being considered by Brussels - a stance the union says it has taken mainly on human rights grounds. Plans for an EU security and defence policy are, in principle, strongly supported by the US, exasperated at its European allies' failure to invest in modern weapons and cooperate better on purchases. At the same time, William Cohen, the American defence secretary, told the Birmingham meeting that the six European countries belonging to Nato but not to the EU - Turkey, Norway, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Iceland - must have a say in the conduct of EU military operations to which they were willing to contribute. The EU was likely to benefit, he said, from common Nato assets such countries helped to provide. Geoff Hoon, the British defence secretary, who strongly supports more European defence cooperation, said he \"respected and supported\" the concerns of the six European Natomembers who are outside the EU, according to British officials. But the officials admit that serious obstacles remain in reaching an agreement that would satisfy the Turks.",

The pension scandal which was to make his name a byword for corruption was far in the future. But, as he checked into his hotel that April evening, little did he know he was being kept under intense surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which suspected that he was a Soviet spy.

The FBI's interest had been aroused because of Maxwell's publishing contacts with American nuclear scientists in secret research centres.

It appears that, ever the opportunist in search of profit, Maxwell cooperated with both the KGB and Britain's foreign spying agency, MI6.

The Soviets had given him exclusive rights and he made millions. But ironically, it was MI6 which had given him the money to establish himself in publishing. MI6 had bankrolled him in the early 1950s as they believed it would be a good chance to obtain intelligence about Soviet scientific work. Maxwell's side of the bargain was to pass on information and help MI6 contact and recruit scientists.",
