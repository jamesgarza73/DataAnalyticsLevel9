Only one English player figures, Alan Shearer in joint sixteenth place, and his \u00a315m move was between two Premiership clubs. Just one other English club gets a mention, Chelsea having just equalled Newcastle United's 1996 splash on Shearer to pick up Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, which is not something anyone would have predicted four years ago. </p> <p>The picture changed slightly when Barcelona handed over some of their Luis Figo millions for Arsenal's Marc Overmars and Emmanuel Petit, but even then it was not the English players in the big-money charts or an English club doing the buying. The conspiracy theory currently doing the rounds about Sir Alex Ferguson preparing the ground for selling David Beckham by unnecessarily raking over last season's controversy, when he was dropped for missing training, values the player at around \u00a340m of Barcelona's or Milan's money, but at this stage is somewhat fanciful. </p> <p>Ferguson appears to have made an uncharacteristic blunder by reopening a matter he promised would stay closed, but is unlikely to have an ulterior motive, much less a machiavellian masterplan. If Manchester United (and their new chief executive, Peter Kenyon) wanted to sell Beckham, they would do so without worrying too much about the player's feelings or their supporters' opinions. </p> <p>Any footballer, and Figo's new fencing price of \u00a3110m proves he is no exception, is always on the market. It just depends on the size of the offer, and if United receive a satisfactory one for Beckham it is hard to imagine their decisive manager or their frugal plc doing anything other than conducting the business first and saving the explanations for later. </p> <p>If sending Beckham to Italy or Michael Owen to Spain is the only way England can make an impression on the international transfer market it makes claims that the Premiership is in any way superior to other European leagues look even more ridiculous. How come English clubs never splash the cash like their continental rivals? We are constantly being told Manchester United are the most profitable football club on earth, yet when they inquired after Figo they quickly decided they couldn't afford him. Real Madrid, protected from bankruptcy by a long list of wealthy and powerful individuals, are unworried by debts of over \u00a3100m and not in the habit of living within their means. </p> <p>Yet even if Real's audacious capture (moved by their president Florentino Perez) of their main rivals' best player is regarded as a one-off, that still leaves a lot of big-money deals around Europe that have passed the Premiership by. English clubs have talked about the Batistutas, the Verons, the Rivaldos and the Trezeguets, but apart from Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's astute purchase of a young Nicolas Anelka, Hasselbaink is the only overseas player in the top 20 to have been landed by a Premiership team. </p> <p>It all seemed so different four years ago, when Newcastle's splurge on Shearer not only shocked English football but set a world transfer record. Back then, the Premiership was only four years old and growing in confidence with every passing season. English football fans observed the arrival of players such as Fabrizio Ravanelli and Roberto di Matteo on absurdly inflated salaries and wondered whether the old order was changing and the Premiership was at last about to challenge the financial might of Serie A . </p> <p>The first Match of the Day of the new season featured a Ravanelli hat-trick against Liverpool and a goal from the halfway line against Wimbledon by Beckham, a young player who had not even figured in Euro 96. There seemed no end to the promise or ambition of the Premiership, which is why Shearer's solitary slide down the table of top deals over the last four years strikes an accusatory note. For new dawn read false dawn. </p> <p>Italian and Spanish clubs always used to monopolise the major signings, with England looking on with a mixture of envy and incredulity, and nothing much has changed. Now, more than ever, the Premiership appears just a new way to dress up leftovers. </p> <p>Maybe English supporters do not want to see their underachieving heroes rewarded any more lavishly than they already are. It is just possible that Premiership clubs have struck the right balance between realism and irresponsibility and should continue cutting their cloth sensibly and leaving the fancy window-dressing to the continentals. All these arguments have merit, but are undermined by the fact that leading Premiership clubs are making more money than ever before, without spending it. </p> <p>The question supporters should be asking is the same one people now ask of the boom years between the wars, when stadiums were filled to watch players whose wages were capped at a pitiful level. What happens to all the surplus income? There is precious little surplus in Italy or Spain, since it all goes to servicing the debt or buying the next superstar. This may make accountants blanche, but the whole point of football clubs is to exist outside the workaday world and you don't find many fans complaining. </p> <p>English clubs, on the other hand, have turned themselves into mini industries where accountants have the upper hand. 'To say Manchester United and other leading British clubs cannot compete with Europe is wrong, because they can,' said Jason Zillwood, of the financial advisers Deloitte &amp; Touche. 'But generally they choose not to, because they have more responsibilities. There are plcs with stock market valuations to consider. A lot more business acumen is involved.' </p> <p>Responsibilities? Stock market valuations? When did it become a virtue for clubs to have an invisible corporate tier between the players and the fans, binding the manager's hands in the transfer market and creaming off a proportion of the profits? When people used to say football needed to be run more like a business, what they meant was that they deserved to be run less like Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. They did not mean football should be turned into business, which is what seems to have happened. For all the grandiose claims advanced on its behalf there is not much bravery any more in the plc-led Premiership. If the knock-on effect of Figo's move produces anything like the predicted player drain, there will shortly be little glamour left either.</p>",

If Manchester United (and their new chief executive, Peter Kenyon) wanted to sell Beckham, they would do so without worrying too much about the player's feelings or their supporters' opinions. Any footballer, and Figo's new fencing price of \u00a3110m proves he is no exception, is always on the market. It just depends on the size of the offer, and if United receive a satisfactory one for Beckham it is hard to imagine their decisive manager or their frugal plc doing anything other than conducting the business first and saving the explanations for later. If sending Beckham to Italy or Michael Owen to Spain is the only way England can make an impression on the international transfer market it makes claims that the Premiership is in any way superior to other European leagues look even more ridiculous. How come English clubs never splash the cash like their continental rivals? We are constantly being told Manchester United are the most profitable football club on earth, yet when they inquired after Figo they quickly decided they couldn't afford him. Real Madrid, protected from bankruptcy by a long list of wealthy and powerful individuals, are unworried by debts of over \u00a3100m and not in the habit of living within their means. Yet even if Real's audacious capture (moved by their president Florentino Perez) of their main rivals' best player is regarded as a one-off, that still leaves a lot of big-money deals around Europe that have passed the Premiership by. English clubs have talked about the Batistutas, the Verons, the Rivaldos and the Trezeguets, but apart from Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's astute purchase of a young Nicolas Anelka, Hasselbaink is the only overseas player in the top 20 to have been landed by a Premiership team. It all seemed so different four years ago, when Newcastle's splurge on Shearer not only shocked English football but set a world transfer record. Back then, the Premiership was only four years old and growing in confidence with every passing season. English football fans observed the arrival of players such as Fabrizio Ravanelli and Roberto di Matteo on absurdly inflated salaries and wondered whether the old order was changing and the Premiership was at last about to challenge the financial might of Serie A . The first Match of the Day of the new season featured a Ravanelli hat-trick against Liverpool and a goal from the halfway line against Wimbledon by Beckham, a young player who had not even figured in Euro 96. There seemed no end to the promise or ambition of the Premiership, which is why Shearer's solitary slide down the table of top deals over the last four years strikes an accusatory note. For new dawn read false dawn. Italian and Spanish clubs always used to monopolise the major signings, with England looking on with a mixture of envy and incredulity, and nothing much has changed. Now, more than ever, the Premiership appears just a new way to dress up leftovers. Maybe English supporters do not want to see their underachieving heroes rewarded any more lavishly than they already are. It is just possible that Premiership clubs have struck the right balance between realism and irresponsibility and should continue cutting their cloth sensibly and leaving the fancy window-dressing to the continentals. All these arguments have merit, but are undermined by the fact that leading Premiership clubs are making more money than ever before, without spending it. The question supporters should be asking is the same one people now ask of the boom years between the wars, when stadiums were filled to watch players whose wages were capped at a pitiful level. What happens to all the surplus income? There is precious little surplus in Italy or Spain, since it all goes to servicing the debt or buying the next superstar. This may make accountants blanche, but the whole point of football clubs is to exist outside the workaday world and you don't find many fans complaining. English clubs, on the other hand, have turned themselves into mini industries where accountants have the upper hand. 'To say Manchester United and other leading British clubs cannot compete with Europe is wrong, because they can,' said Jason Zillwood, of the financial advisers Deloitte &amp; Touche. 'But generally they choose not to, because they have more responsibilities. There are plcs with stock market valuations to consider. A lot more business acumen is involved.' Responsibilities? Stock market valuations? When did it become a virtue for clubs to have an invisible corporate tier between the players and the fans, binding the manager's hands in the transfer market and creaming off a proportion of the profits? When people used to say football needed to be run more like a business, what they meant was that they deserved to be run less like Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. They did not mean football should be turned into business, which is what seems to have happened. For all the grandiose claims advanced on its behalf there is not much bravery any more in the plc-led Premiership. If the knock-on effect of Figo's move produces anything like the predicted player drain, there will shortly be little glamour left either.",

Irene Krechowieka says be cautious about some of the sassy new employment sites on the web - they promise to deliver, but do they have the goods? She recommends the BBC's Job Jungle and also thinks you should do some company research by visiting their sites to find out more about them. \"Employers' websites can be a rich source of jobs,\" she says. \"And employers will be impressed by people who are motivated enough to go looking for them.\" Some can let you apply on-line. Hewlett Packard, for example has an application form on its site which is speculative and will be held by them for six months. \"Work is not the only option, \" she says. \"There's volunteering, a year out or further study.\" Summer is a good time to review your skills, says Paul Redmond of ADCAS and head of careers at Liverpool Hope University. And keep in touch with careers services - you can use your local university's advice centre - and check out the website. \"Take small risks,\" advises Redmond. \"Step outside your comfort zone and do something different during the summer which will make you stand out from other candidates. And network - everybody who is in a job, knows about a job vacancy\" And finally ... don't become a slacker. Don't go home and spend the next eight weeks chilling out in front of the TV. Enjoy yourself, yes, says the Graduate Recruiters' Association's Carl Gilleard, but it's a balancing act. \"Keep active and productive,\" he advises. \"Home is not the real world and there can be a sense of disconnectedness.\" You have been a part of a community ever since you started school and now you're on your own, so don't isolate yourself. Gilleard points to the danger of a rapid loss of confidence if you hang about at home, undecided about your future. \"You lose your sense of perspective,\" he says\" and decisions which should be simple to make become big issues. You have just graduated and your brain is toned up, keep it that way.\" And don't spend all day in bed - remember the world of work is during daylight hours, so you'd better start getting used to it.",

I have a real fear of being found out as a fraud - logically I know that I've got the experience and the know-how to do the job, but I still can't quite believe I can pull it off.\" </p> <p>Most of us have, at some time or another, felt exactly the same way - the heady feeling of excitement at being awarded a promotion or new responsibility, mixed with a slight edge of disbelief and a - usually totally ungrounded - fear that you don't actually deserve it. \"It's all about confidence,\" believes psychologist Ben Williamson. \"It's natural to worry a little how you're going to manage a new set of responsibilities - but it's important to have enough confidence to be able to reassure yourself that you'll cope.\" </p> <p>Gaining confidence can be tricky, but it's not just about standing in front of the mirror and repeatedly telling yourself that you're great. Confidence comes from a variety of sources - how you dress, how you communicate and how you present yourself - as well as how you feel inside. Fortunately, the first three are far easier to do something about. </p> <p>\"For the first couple of weeks I felt completely like a fish out of water,\" says Carolson, \"and I also felt that everyone looked smarter and more together than me. With my first pay cheque I went out and bought two new suits, had an expensive haircut and bought some decent make-up. It might sound superficial, but it really helped - suddenly I felt confident about how I looked - and that helped lift my self-esteem in other areas.\" </p> <p>According to Laurel Herman, whose company Positive Presence deals with how to put your best image across, gaining confidence in the workplace is all about how you appear. \"It's not just about how you look - although obviously an immaculate appearance is going to contribute to an air of professionalism,\" she says. \"It's also about how you come across - and that's a mix between being positive and in-control, and not being too over-confident. If you swagger in being too cocksure one of two things will happen - people will either see through it and realise it's an act, or they will simply think you're arrogant.\" </p> <p>In theory, it all sounds like common sense, but in reality it can be a hard balancing act to pull off - particularly if you're trying to learn new skills or areas of responsibility at the same time. \"When I got promoted I was the youngest spokesperson working for our organisation,\" says Charles Jordan, who works for a large business institute. </p> <p>\"I was determined to seem up to the job, so I was always the first to volunteer for anything, to offer an opinion in a meeting, to come up with new ideas. I was worried that if I didn't look like I was firing on all cylinders all the time, people would think I couldn't do it. In the end no-one thought that, but they did all think I was the most annoying person in the office.\" </p> <p>Jordan has a point - no-one is more annoying in office life than the person who constantly tries too hard, and no-one is more consistently perceived as insecure about their position. </p> <p>\"The simplest way of overcoming anxiety is simply to look at the facts,\" believes Ben Williamson. \"No-one is promoted, or given more responsibility because they are bad at their job, or unprofessional. Neither does it happen through luck. If you accept the fact that you have been rewarded for working competently and confidently, then your faith in your own abilities will soon rise.\" </p> <p>If you truly believe that you can't change the way you feel inside, then concentrate on the differences you can make. Buy an expensive new suit, get a haircut, have some new business cards printed. Concentrate on your body language - if you fidget, try and stop it, if you feel you talk too much, try and be more concise and think what you want to put across. \"Getting the right image is like doing a jigsaw puzzle,\" says Laurel Herman, \"all the different pieces need to fit together. It can take time but, what is certain, is that once you get one thing right, the others come more easily. If you feel confident in how you look, you will communicate better, others will respond better, and so it goes on.\" </p> <p> If you don't remember anything else... </p> <p>There is a great saying; Be brave. If you can't be brave, pretend. Most people don't know the difference. Look smart, be positive and remind yourself that no-one needs convincing of anything. Except you. </p>",

In the end no-one thought that, but they did all think I was the most annoying person in the office.\" Jordan has a point - no-one is more annoying in office life than the person who constantly tries too hard, and no-one is more consistently perceived as insecure about their position. \"The simplest way of overcoming anxiety is simply to look at the facts,\" believes Ben Williamson. \"No-one is promoted, or given more responsibility because they are bad at their job, or unprofessional. Neither does it happen through luck. If you accept the fact that you have been rewarded for working competently and confidently, then your faith in your own abilities will soon rise.\" If you truly believe that you can't change the way you feel inside, then concentrate on the differences you can make. Buy an expensive new suit, get a haircut, have some new business cards printed. Concentrate on your body language - if you fidget, try and stop it, if you feel you talk too much, try and be more concise and think what you want to put across. \"Getting the right image is like doing a jigsaw puzzle,\" says Laurel Herman, \"all the different pieces need to fit together. It can take time but, what is certain, is that once you get one thing right, the others come more easily. If you feel confident in how you look, you will communicate better, others will respond better, and so it goes on.\" If you don't remember anything else... There is a great saying; Be brave. If you can't be brave, pretend. Most people don't know the difference. Look smart, be positive and remind yourself that no-one needs convincing of anything. Except you.",

      "byline": "Jonathan Glancey",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>You would think me drunk if I sat down and told you what Moscow nightlife is like today. It is, in a word, delirious. And, in other words, it's sexist, chauvinistic, painfully loud, flashy, wasteful, boastful, swaggering, libidinous, overpriced, decadent, sometimes dangerous. </p> <p>It's dangerously hormonal, too - as highly charged as a Vostok rocket about to lift off, and as far in spirit from life in the former Soviet Union as a weekend in Las Vegas. </p> <p>Things have settled down a bit since the New Russian heyday - or, more accurately, wild night - of the first five years following the collapse of the Red empire. I had last been in Moscow in 1994, when the first generation of late-night bars, clubs and casinos really were stuffed, wall-to-wall, with low-cut Versace, black Armani suits, fistfuls of dollars, champagne by the bucketful, and protected by the meanest- looking hoods this side of Ronnie and Reggie Kray. </p> <p>My friends took me to eat - the men packing pistols - at the Up &amp; Down Club. It is still there, at Zubovosky Bulvar 4 (Metro: Park Cultury), if you want to experience the fag end of New Russian excess - real gangsters and molls. But as they charge $70 to get into the restaurant and bar before you eat, you might decide that trying to relive the early days of nighttime glasnost and perestroika is best left to the smoke-windowed BMW set. </p> <p>Versace might have given way to DKNY and Prada in the minds of wealthy young former comrades yet, although less frontier-town in spirit than it was in 1994, Moscow after dark remains a riotous if far from revolutionary place. This is, says the cosmopolitan staff of listings magazine The Exile (TE), \"no place for Dutch tourists\" or \"sexless, progressive Canadian couples\". </p> <p>Nor for those with socialist sympathies, weak livers or high moral standards, either. Feminists, save for those seeking to be offended, should never step across the threshold of these testosterone-, vodka-, cocaine- and E-fuelled meat markets. Bars and clubs in Berlin, London and New York might be infinitely more sophisticated, but if you want to get drunk, laid and ripped-off in equal measure, dive in. </p> <p>If you want to begin to understand Moscow today - a city through which 80% of Russia's GDP passes - you ought to give yourself a wild weekend out on the town. </p> <p>There are a few things you should bear in mind, though, before you head off into the wild yonder. There is zero tolerance for drinking and driving. The Moscow Metro runs like clockwork - trains every one-to-two minutes on all 10 lines on weekdays from 5.30am to 1.15am. Not late enough for those heading home around 2am, but early enough for those leaving all-night bars and clubs. </p> <p>There is never a problem with transport. When the Metro, trams, trolleybuses and diesel buses have packed up for the night, flag down almost any private car - more often than not a jacked-up Lada driven by an Ali G wannabe with a Mother Russia of a sound system - and negotiate your way home. </p> <p>Expect to pay between 50 and 100 roubles (\u00a31.25 and \u00a32.50) to get to most places in the city limits. Women best travel in pairs or packs, but this holds true for most big cities. Moscow isn't particularly dangerous unless you're involved in big business deals, drugs or want to pick a fight. Just don't, even if you think you are tough. Older men in bars, despite a lack of wedding rings are mostly married; many younger women are on the game. There are very few gay bars and only one for women only. </p> <p>Opening hours vary, with some serving 24 hours a day. Bars and clubs come and go: the latest travel guide will be out of date by the time it reaches the shelves. </p> <p>There may or may not be cover charges; women are nearly always admitted free. Weekdays can be quiet, while Fridays and Saturdays are crowded. Drinks are generally more expensive than in Britain, and pushing and shoving is regarded as something of a local custom. </p> <p> The mwaa, mwaa, twittering boho-chic of London's Clerkenwell, Hoxton and Shoreditch has yet to invade Moscow. In fact, it's as likely to get to Red Square as Napoleon or Hitler were. TE has definite, although realistic views, about the bars designed for refined British tourists (sorry, travellers) with history-of-art degrees keen on scented candles and difficult ethnic recipes. </p> <p><strong> Doug and Marty's Boar House</strong><br> <strong> Address:</strong> Zemlyanoi Val 26. <br> <strong> Hours:</strong> 24 hours. <br> <strong> Cover charge:</strong> 60 roubles for women, 100R for men. <br> <strong> Metro:</strong> Kurskaya. </p> <p> <strong> What TE says:</strong> \"Weekend packed with liquored-up clientele working their mojo, sweaty prole chicks doing their best to look sexy, commercial DJs playing Ricky Martin, and loose young prey.\" The Boar House boasts $50 hookers, \"aggressively quasi-latino men\". </p> <p> <strong> What you get:</strong> A heaving bar set up by Doug Steel, a big, shaven-headed Canadian best known for his former Hungry Duck bar, where hundreds of girls were admitted for a single greenback, fuelled on free liquor for a couple of hours before the local lads and ex-pats were let in. Result: bedlam and what Time Out's unsexist and considered guide to Moscow described thus: \"The stench of Slavic pheromones burns your nose, sweat drips from the ceiling, the floor is slip pery with spilled beer and vomit, and the toilets are awash with puke.\" </p> <p><strong> Cabana</strong><br> <strong> Address:</strong> Raushkaya Nab 4. <br> <strong> Hours:</strong> 6pm-6am. <br> <strong> Cover charge:</strong> None. <br> <strong> Metro:</strong> Tretyakovskaya. </p> <p> <strong> What TE says:</strong> \"Strippers and hookers go here on nights off.\" </p> <p> <strong> What you get:</strong> Colourful interior; two bars serving the kind of fancy blue or red cocktails of the plastic-monkey-climbing-up-a-plastic-swivel-stick variety that were popular in London in the early 1980s. Live music, good deli restaurant, TV monitors (Beavis and Butthead are very popular among sandpaper-headed young Moscovite men.) Affordable. Be warned: the place is empty on weekdays. </p> <p><strong> The Embassy Club</strong><br> <strong> Address:</strong> 8/10 Bryusov Per. <br> <strong> Hours:</strong> Variable. <br> <strong> Cover charge:</strong> None. <br> <strong> Metro: </strong> Pushkinskaya. </p> <p> <strong> What TE says:</strong> \"Walk-in humidor should impress upwardly-mobile dyevs [babes] and Cuban bar tenders are said to make some wicked cocktails. Appropriately impressive toilets. Live jazz that doesn't suck... but do you really like cigars? How about the people that smoke them?\" </p> <p> <strong> What you get:</strong> Upmarket cigar lounge and bar. Bit like Che's in London's St James's. Late flowering yuppy hangout comes with hangover. </p> <p><strong> Taxman</strong><br> <strong> Address: </strong> Krymsky Val 6. <br> <strong> Hours:</strong> Midday-6am. <br> <strong> Cover charge:</strong> 80R on live music nights. <br> <strong> Metro: </strong> Park Kultury. </p> <p> <strong> What TE says:</strong> \"When we say skanky teens, we mean really skanky.\" </p> <p> <strong> What you get:</strong> Really tacky club for the former proletariat (sorry, heroic sons and daughters of the Revolution). Clientele like to strip. Young men are big and scary. </p> <p><strong> Gallereya</strong><br> <strong> Address: </strong> Corner of Petrova and Strastnoy Bulvar. <br> <strong> Hours:</strong> Variable. <br> <strong> Cover charge:</strong> None. <br> <strong> Metro:</strong> Pushkinskaya. </p> <p> <strong> What TE says: </strong> \"Tasteful minimalist interior, with a nod to Egon Schiele, designed as an ironic low-key gallery for the Merc-Jeep set. Babes de Milio on every square inch of floor - touch a chick, though, and your body won't float to the top of the Moskva River until mid-spring.\" </p> <p> <strong> What you get: </strong> Designer chic bar; there are a few of these in Moscow. Drinks are mega-expensive. Not for Brits on average salaries. </p> <p><strong> Night Flight</strong><br> <strong> Address:</strong> Nochnoi Polyot, Tverskaya Ultisa 17. <br> <strong> Hours:</strong> Variable. <br> <strong> Cover charge:</strong> None. <br> <strong> Metro:</strong> Tverskaya. </p> <p> <strong> What TE says:</strong> \"Features a 'Business Class' section for married men with hastily removed wedding rings... The place is packed with drop-dead gorgeous women, practically every one of whom is for sale; a place for corporate entertainment where you can run into your boss or Russian girlfriend.\" </p> <p> <strong> What you get:</strong> Night Flight is a Swedish-run club that, while down at heel a few years ago, is back on hideous form. Meat market for ex-pats. Food is said to be great. </p> <p><strong> Sirius</strong><br> <strong> Address:</strong> Strasnoi Bulvar 10, Str 2. <br> <strong> Hours:</strong> 6pm-6am. <br> <strong> Cover charge:</strong> None. <br> <strong> Metro:</strong> Chekhovskaya. </p> <p> <strong> What you get:</strong> If you thought any of the above were beyond the pale, Sirius boasts a \"Monica Lewinsky Cigar Room\". Don't even ask. The \"Crazy Menu\" allows you to choose anything, from the songs the working girls sing to the girls themselves. </p> <p><strong> Golden Palace</strong><br> <strong> Address:</strong> 3rd Yamskogo Polya, 15. <br> <strong> Hours:</strong> 8pm-8am. <br> <strong> Cover charge:</strong> 250,000 roubles for men (ie to stop outsiders getting in); women admitted for free. <br> <strong> Metro:</strong> Belorusskaya. </p> <p> <strong> What you get:</strong> A taste of 1920s Chicago, Moscow-style. This is the place for those (stupidly) in love with gangster chic, except the gangsters are for real and the guards tote pump-action shotguns. Forget it; Brits just don't have this sort of money. </p> <p><strong> Buchenwald Club</strong><br> </p> <p> Unless you are mad, leave this one well alone. This is a skinhead/grunge/techno club. Can be a touch violent. Don't ask if they do kosher food. Mind you, that's pretty good advice for all too many places in Moscow, which has Viennese tendencies. </p> <p><strong> Krai</strong><br> <strong> Address: </strong> Spartakovskaya 14. <br> <strong> Hours:</strong> \"Hell if we know\" (TE). <br> <strong> Metro:</strong> Baumanskaya. </p> <p> <strong> What TE says:</strong> \"Boho-arty club, said to have a cool crowd. This place was as dead as William Burroughs the last time we were here.\" </p> <p><strong> Krisis Zhanra</strong><br> <strong> Address: </strong> Bolshoi Vlasyevsky Per, Dom 4. <br> <strong> Hours:</strong> 11am-midnight. <br> <strong> Metro:</strong> Kropotinskaya. </p> <p> <strong> What TE says:</strong> \"Come here and mellow out with the rest of Moscow Boho-intelli crowd. Good place to sit and act alienated, waiting to be discovered by someone...

      "bodyText": "You would think me drunk if I sat down and told you what Moscow nightlife is like today. It is, in a word, delirious. And, in other words, it's sexist, chauvinistic, painfully loud, flashy, wasteful, boastful, swaggering, libidinous, overpriced, decadent, sometimes dangerous. It's dangerously hormonal, too - as highly charged as a Vostok rocket about to lift off, and as far in spirit from life in the former Soviet Union as a weekend in Las Vegas. Things have settled down a bit since the New Russian heyday - or, more accurately, wild night - of the first five years following the collapse of the Red empire. I had last been in Moscow in 1994, when the first generation of late-night bars, clubs and casinos really were stuffed, wall-to-wall, with low-cut Versace, black Armani suits, fistfuls of dollars, champagne by the bucketful, and protected by the meanest- looking hoods this side of Ronnie and Reggie Kray. My friends took me to eat - the men packing pistols - at the Up &amp; Down Club. It is still there, at Zubovosky Bulvar 4 (Metro: Park Cultury), if you want to experience the fag end of New Russian excess - real gangsters and molls. But as they charge $70 to get into the restaurant and bar before you eat, you might decide that trying to relive the early days of nighttime glasnost and perestroika is best left to the smoke-windowed BMW set. Versace might have given way to DKNY and Prada in the minds of wealthy young former comrades yet, although less frontier-town in spirit than it was in 1994, Moscow after dark remains a riotous if far from revolutionary place. This is, says the cosmopolitan staff of listings magazine The Exile (TE), \"no place for Dutch tourists\" or \"sexless, progressive Canadian couples\". Nor for those with socialist sympathies, weak livers or high moral standards, either. Feminists, save for those seeking to be offended, should never step across the threshold of these testosterone-, vodka-, cocaine- and E-fuelled meat markets. Bars and clubs in Berlin, London and New York might be infinitely more sophisticated, but if you want to get drunk, laid and ripped-off in equal measure, dive in. If you want to begin to understand Moscow today - a city through which 80% of Russia's GDP passes - you ought to give yourself a wild weekend out on the town. There are a few things you should bear in mind, though, before you head off into the wild yonder. There is zero tolerance for drinking and driving. The Moscow Metro runs like clockwork - trains every one-to-two minutes on all 10 lines on weekdays from 5.30am to 1.15am. Not late enough for those heading home around 2am, but early enough for those leaving all-night bars and clubs. There is never a problem with transport. When the Metro, trams, trolleybuses and diesel buses have packed up for the night, flag down almost any private car - more often than not a jacked-up Lada driven by an Ali G wannabe with a Mother Russia of a sound system - and negotiate your way home. Expect to pay between 50 and 100 roubles (\u00a31.25 and \u00a32.50) to get to most places in the city limits. Women best travel in pairs or packs, but this holds true for most big cities. Moscow isn't particularly dangerous unless you're involved in big business deals, drugs or want to pick a fight. Just don't, even if you think you are tough. Older men in bars, despite a lack of wedding rings are mostly married; many younger women are on the game. There are very few gay bars and only one for women only. Opening hours vary, with some serving 24 hours a day. Bars and clubs come and go: the latest travel guide will be out of date by the time it reaches the shelves. There may or may not be cover charges; women are nearly always admitted free. Weekdays can be quiet, while Fridays and Saturdays are crowded. Drinks are generally more expensive than in Britain, and pushing and shoving is regarded as something of a local custom. The mwaa, mwaa, twittering boho-chic of London's Clerkenwell, Hoxton and Shoreditch has yet to invade Moscow. In fact, it's as likely to get to Red Square as Napoleon or Hitler were. TE has definite, although realistic views, about the bars designed for refined British tourists (sorry, travellers) with history-of-art degrees keen on scented candles and difficult ethnic recipes. Doug and Marty's Boar House Address: Zemlyanoi Val 26. Hours: 24 hours. Cover charge: 60 roubles for women, 100R for men. Metro: Kurskaya. What TE says: \"Weekend packed with liquored-up clientele working their mojo, sweaty prole chicks doing their best to look sexy, commercial DJs playing Ricky Martin, and loose young prey.\" The Boar House boasts $50 hookers, \"aggressively quasi-latino men\". What you get: A heaving bar set up by Doug Steel, a big, shaven-headed Canadian best known for his former Hungry Duck bar, where hundreds of girls were admitted for a single greenback, fuelled on free liquor for a couple of hours before the local lads and ex-pats were let in. Result: bedlam and what Time Out's unsexist and considered guide to Moscow described thus: \"The stench of Slavic pheromones burns your nose, sweat drips from the ceiling, the floor is slip pery with spilled beer and vomit, and the toilets are awash with puke.\" Cabana Address: Raushkaya Nab 4. Hours: 6pm-6am. Cover charge: None. Metro: Tretyakovskaya. What TE says: \"Strippers and hookers go here on nights off.\" What you get: Colourful interior; two bars serving the kind of fancy blue or red cocktails of the plastic-monkey-climbing-up-a-plastic-swivel-stick variety that were popular in London in the early 1980s. Live music, good deli restaurant, TV monitors (Beavis and Butthead are very popular among sandpaper-headed young Moscovite men.) Affordable. Be warned: the place is empty on weekdays. The Embassy Club Address: 8/10 Bryusov Per. Hours: Variable. Cover charge: None. Metro: Pushkinskaya. What TE says: \"Walk-in humidor should impress upwardly-mobile dyevs [babes] and Cuban bar tenders are said to make some wicked cocktails. Appropriately impressive toilets. Live jazz that doesn't suck... but do you really like cigars? How about the people that smoke them?\" What you get: Upmarket cigar lounge and bar. Bit like Che's in London's St James's. Late flowering yuppy hangout comes with hangover. Taxman Address: Krymsky Val 6. Hours: Midday-6am. Cover charge: 80R on live music nights. Metro: Park Kultury. What TE says: \"When we say skanky teens, we mean really skanky.\" What you get: Really tacky club for the former proletariat (sorry, heroic sons and daughters of the Revolution). Clientele like to strip. Young men are big and scary. Gallereya Address: Corner of Petrova and Strastnoy Bulvar. Hours: Variable. Cover charge: None. Metro: Pushkinskaya. What TE says: \"Tasteful minimalist interior, with a nod to Egon Schiele, designed as an ironic low-key gallery for the Merc-Jeep set. Babes de Milio on every square inch of floor - touch a chick, though, and your body won't float to the top of the Moskva River until mid-spring.\" What you get: Designer chic bar; there are a few of these in Moscow. Drinks are mega-expensive. Not for Brits on average salaries. Night Flight Address: Nochnoi Polyot, Tverskaya Ultisa 17. Hours: Variable. Cover charge: None. Metro: Tverskaya. What TE says: \"Features a 'Business Class' section for married men with hastily removed wedding rings... The place is packed with drop-dead gorgeous women, practically every one of whom is for sale; a place for corporate entertainment where you can run into your boss or Russian girlfriend.\" What you get: Night Flight is a Swedish-run club that, while down at heel a few years ago, is back on hideous form. Meat market for ex-pats. Food is said to be great. Sirius Address: Strasnoi Bulvar 10, Str 2. Hours: 6pm-6am. Cover charge: None. Metro: Chekhovskaya. What you get: If you thought any of the above were beyond the pale, Sirius boasts a \"Monica Lewinsky Cigar Room\". Don't even ask. The \"Crazy Menu\" allows you to choose anything, from the songs the working girls sing to the girls themselves. Golden Palace Address: 3rd Yamskogo Polya, 15. Hours: 8pm-8am. Cover charge: 250,000 roubles for men (ie to stop outsiders getting in); women admitted for free. Metro: Belorusskaya. What you get: A taste of 1920s Chicago, Moscow-style. This is the place for those (stupidly) in love with gangster chic, except the gangsters are for real and the guards tote pump-action shotguns. Forget it; Brits just don't have this sort of money. Buchenwald Club Unless you are mad, leave this one well alone. This is a skinhead/grunge/techno club. Can be a touch violent. Don't ask if they do kosher food. Mind you, that's pretty good advice for all too many places in Moscow, which has Viennese tendencies. Krai Address: Spartakovskaya 14. Hours: \"Hell if we know\" (TE). Metro: Baumanskaya. What TE says: \"Boho-arty club, said to have a cool crowd. This place was as dead as William Burroughs the last time we were here.\" Krisis Zhanra Address: Bolshoi Vlasyevsky Per, Dom 4. Hours: 11am-midnight. Metro: Kropotinskaya. What TE says: \"Come here and mellow out with the rest of Moscow Boho-intelli crowd. Good place to sit and act alienated, waiting to be discovered by someone... Too many quirky, horn-rimmed glasses types.\" What you get: A safe place to sport your goatee and combat trousers and talk intensely, or not at all. Few Muscovites. OGI Club Address: 8/12 Potopovsky Pereulo Str 2. Metro: Chistiye Prudi. What TE says: \"Good place to take Dutch tourists.\" What you get: Poetry and book readings for those of a literary disposition. The Horse and Hounds Address: Malaya Kommunisticheskaya Ulitsa 16/27. Metro: Marksistskaya. What you get: Same as in any of chain of John Bull pubs. Rosie O'Grady's Address: Znamenka 9/12. Metro: Borovitskaya. What you get: By the Kremlin; \"Irish\" staff hail from the Caucasus, but what the hell? Shamrock Irish Bar Address: Arbat Irish House Novy Arbat 11. Metro: Arbatskaya. What you get: The first foreign-owned pub to open after \"perestroika\". Closes, like Rosie's, when the last punter wobbles out. The practicals British Airways (0845 7733377) flies direct from Heathrow for \u00a3357 including tax; Scandinavian Airlines (0845 6072772) for \u00a3306.20 inc tax from Heathrow/Stansted via Stockholm.

      "body": "<p>We had both always dreamed of going to South America; reading Che Guevara's The Motorcycle Diaries, the classic account of his 7,000-mile journey through the deserts and mountains of South America was exactly the kind of inspiration we needed. We were both 23, the same age as Che had been at the time, and had time on our hands after finishing university. The fact that we had never ridden motorcycles before didn't seem important, and we began planning and publicising in earnest. </p> <p>Since Che was so moved by meeting the patients in Peruvian leprosy colonies en route, we decided our journey would mark the 75th anniversary of LEPRA, the British Leprosy Relief Association. </p> <p>One year later, we found ourselves in Buenos Aires with motorbikes we were barely able to ride. We loaded up and headed for the town of Alta Gracia, where Che was brought up. Our arrival caused quite a stir, attracting local television and radio coverage. We interviewed Che's ageing yet sprightly primary school teacher, Elba Rossi, who gave us sweet cherry liquor and recounted tales of the future revolutionary. A surprisingly normal boy it seemed, with a penchant for stealing peaches from other people's gardens. </p> <p>Back in the capital, we felt ready to follow the trail blazed by Che, leaving 47 years and five months to the day that both he and his friend Alberto set off in January 1952, heading down the flat Atlantic coast. At the town of Bahi\u00e1 Blanca, we turned inland and rode into the heart of the vast Pampas. Still on good roads, we made rapid progress through the wastes of thorny scrub until the increasing cold and the short daylight hours of the southern hemisphere winter began to limit our riding time. By the time San Martin de los Andes and the epony mous foothills which surround it loomed large in front of our eyes, we had been frozen to the core on more than one occasion. </p> <p>As the cold nights intensified, our five-litre water sack would freeze - a fate that also befell the contents of the Thermos flask and, to our annoyance, the washing up liquid bottle. The clarity of the stars in the clear, dry air would have been a consolation had we been warm enough to stay out for any length of time to appreciate them in all their beauty. </p> <p>Our decision to travel light meant we had denied ourselves the luxury of a tent, instead packing two khaki German army ponchos that we clipped together and slung between the bikes to make a rudimentary shelter. This proved far from satisfactory, and we'd spend the long frozen nights buried at the bottom of our sleeping bags, still wearing all our clothes, boots and riding gear. </p> <p>The Southern Argentine Andes in June are somewhat reminiscent of the English Lake District in winter - great barren, snow-clad mountains, expanses of rock interspersed with glacial lakes. It was only when both ourselves and the road became snow clad that we realised how bitter the conditions could be. </p> <p>Fortunately, however, we soon left behind Argentina's bleak wastes and crossed the border into Chile, where the lush dank vegetation was a welcome relief. However this proved to be short-lived, it quickly becoming apparent that the reason for Southern Chile's verdancy was a ridiculous amount of rain. Our first stop, the town of Osorno, has an average of 200 days rain a year, typically concentrated at the time we were there. </p> <p>We spent two days sheltering in a barn with a bronchial and homeless ex-trucker named Gonzalez. Heartily sharing our suppers of pasta and beer, he explained how most people in Chile hated General Pinochet and why Rolls-Royce represented everything that was good about Britain. </p> <p>After 48 hours we realised the chances of a break in the downpour were remote and headed off to Puerto Montt, Chile's most southerly town with road access to the north. We were still 2,000 miles south of the border crossing into tropical Peru and it felt like it. </p> <p>The murky clouds which obscured the classically beautiful pyramid peak of Volcan Osorno set the scene for the next two weeks. Progress was always slow, with frequent stops needed in order to warm our bones. </p> <p>In such conditions, the disadvantages of our ponchos really became apparent. The moisture content of our sleeping area was little helped by the hoods each poncho sported in the middle, and come morning we rarely awoke dry and warm. Our appearance went steadily down hill: more than once a friendly stranger took pity and offered us the use of their washing facilities. </p> <p>Then one of the bikes gave up the ghost and left us stranded in the grey town of Los Angeles. Our mechanical ineptitude ensured that not only did we not know what caused the problem but that even when we had located a worn out spark plug with the help of a friendly mechanic, we found that we had brought the wrong spares. </p> <p>We must have looked pretty sorry for ourselves since the mechanic, Francisco, lit a charcoal brazier to dry our sodden clothes and, having offered us accommodation on the workshop floor, proceeded to bedeck the fire with the beginnings of surely the greatest barbecue in the history of mankind. Soon the heady gin-like Chilean national drink of Pisco made an appearance, and the rest of the evening is a blur. </p> <p>Los Angeles marked a change of fortune, and on the road to the capital, Santiago, we received just one more severe drenching. Indeed, from Santiago onwards we experienced only five minutes of light drizzle in the next 3,500 miles. </p> <p>After a short spell in the dull Europeanised capital it was a relief to head up the rugged winding Pacific coast Easy Rider-style in bright sunshine. Soon, the scenery metamorphosed from grassland to scrub, from scrub to cactus and from cactus to sand, and we found ourselves on the edge of the driest desert in the world. </p> <p>The Atacama desert is not to be taken lightly, and certainly not on motorbikes with a meagre 100-mile range, so we acquired spare jerry cans and extra water bottles in the picturesque colonial centre of La Serena. The town was founded in 1544 by the Spanish conquistador Juan Buhon following his hellish crossing of the Atacama, in which more than half the conquistadors and their native slaves died. It was with some trepidation that we headed for the desert. </p> <p>In the bleak wastes of the Atacama, the shimmering road ahead was our only link with civilisation. Throughout the day we passed ghost towns, roofless houses alone in the desolate haze. In the breathless midday heat we stopped at one of these old nitrate mining settlements, Officina Edwards. Searching for shade in one of its crumbling buildings, the interior walls still painted a faded yellow and maroon, we found an immaculate 1920s child's leather shoe, delicately stitched and nailed, perfectly preserved in the dry air. Through a paneless, shutterless window, out across the hot sand, a solitary cross marked a forgotten grave. We sat listlessly in the relentless heat, sipping our precious water and tried to imagine the harsh life of the mining families that the dusty remains once housed. </p> <p>It was in the desert wastes that Che, (like any a good prophet should) had one of the revelations that shaped his life. One bitterly cold night spent sharing a \"miserable blanket\" with a persecuted communist miner and his wife was an experience that made Che feel closer, really for the first time, to the marginalised people he would later come to fight for: those he then termed this \"strange, for me at least, human species\". </p> <p>Back on the road, we pushed on across a barren expanse of flat, grey desert bounded by the spectacular volcanoes that mark Chile's border with Bolivia; at the oasis village of San Pedro de Atacama we left the road behind. We felt truly free bumping along the rutted gravely tracks. The dust billowed out behind us and there was nothing in sight except parched bare-backed mountains that rose up from the plain. </p> <p>That night, we had no need to erect our ponchos as we found our way into the Valley of the Moon, a fantastic selection of wind sculpted rocks and dunes. </p> <p>Nevertheless, real adventure beckoned, and we set course for the El Tatio geyser field on the side of one of the distant volcanoes that mark the border with Bolivia. The road was terrible, and we bounced and shook our way upwards throughout the day, the air becoming thinner and colder by the minute. It proved to be the most spec tacular period of riding we had experienced. </p> <p>When we reached the geysers in the late afternoon we were exhausted but elated. We had made it to 15,000 feet on our struggling bikes, vicu\u00f1as (wild relations of the llama) running out in front of us from frozen lakes, the dust from their hooves hanging ghostlike in the cold dry air long after our passing. </p> <p>The geysers turned out to be gently bubbling steaming pools in which we boiled eggs for breakfast, frozen and feeling like death because of altitude sickness. Much as we would have liked to stay to appreciate the stunning scenery, we feared for our health and hastily descended. </p> <p>Back on the main roads we made speedy progress towards mountainous Peru. The sun shone brightly everyday, and although the desert nights were bitterly cold, we could sleep without shelter by the side of our bikes. </p> <p>Peru proved completely different to anything we had expected. Within 60 miles of the border we were ascending steadily on ancient roads, little more than donkey tracks, through a land that time had forgotten, epitomised by the ruins of the Inca citadel of Machu Picchu. </p> <p>Three months after setting out, we made it into the polluted heart of Lima, our faces looking like chimney sweeps from all the soot we had accumulated in our helmets along the way. </p> <p>In Lima, Che stayed with a famous leprologist, Dr Hugo Pesce and was greatly moved by the patients he met there. He later headed north into the jungle, where he spent his 24th birthday with the leprosy patients of the San Pablo colony on the Amazon; Che was on the cusp of his true vocation.</p> <p>\u0095BBC Radio 4 will broadcast the story of Ben and Karl's journey on Tuesday at 11am as part of its six-part series of travellers' stories, Tales from the Back of Beyond.

Still on good roads, we made rapid progress through the wastes of thorny scrub until the increasing cold and the short daylight hours of the southern hemisphere winter began to limit our riding time. By the time San Martin de los Andes and the epony mous foothills which surround it loomed large in front of our eyes, we had been frozen to the core on more than one occasion. As the cold nights intensified, our five-litre water sack would freeze - a fate that also befell the contents of the Thermos flask and, to our annoyance, the washing up liquid bottle. The clarity of the stars in the clear, dry air would have been a consolation had we been warm enough to stay out for any length of time to appreciate them in all their beauty. Our decision to travel light meant we had denied ourselves the luxury of a tent, instead packing two khaki German army ponchos that we clipped together and slung between the bikes to make a rudimentary shelter. This proved far from satisfactory, and we'd spend the long frozen nights buried at the bottom of our sleeping bags, still wearing all our clothes, boots and riding gear. The Southern Argentine Andes in June are somewhat reminiscent of the English Lake District in winter - great barren, snow-clad mountains, expanses of rock interspersed with glacial lakes. It was only when both ourselves and the road became snow clad that we realised how bitter the conditions could be. Fortunately, however, we soon left behind Argentina's bleak wastes and crossed the border into Chile, where the lush dank vegetation was a welcome relief. However this proved to be short-lived, it quickly becoming apparent that the reason for Southern Chile's verdancy was a ridiculous amount of rain. Our first stop, the town of Osorno, has an average of 200 days rain a year, typically concentrated at the time we were there. We spent two days sheltering in a barn with a bronchial and homeless ex-trucker named Gonzalez. Heartily sharing our suppers of pasta and beer, he explained how most people in Chile hated General Pinochet and why Rolls-Royce represented everything that was good about Britain. After 48 hours we realised the chances of a break in the downpour were remote and headed off to Puerto Montt, Chile's most southerly town with road access to the north. We were still 2,000 miles south of the border crossing into tropical Peru and it felt like it. The murky clouds which obscured the classically beautiful pyramid peak of Volcan Osorno set the scene for the next two weeks. Progress was always slow, with frequent stops needed in order to warm our bones. In such conditions, the disadvantages of our ponchos really became apparent. The moisture content of our sleeping area was little helped by the hoods each poncho sported in the middle, and come morning we rarely awoke dry and warm. Our appearance went steadily down hill: more than once a friendly stranger took pity and offered us the use of their washing facilities. Then one of the bikes gave up the ghost and left us stranded in the grey town of Los Angeles. Our mechanical ineptitude ensured that not only did we not know what caused the problem but that even when we had located a worn out spark plug with the help of a friendly mechanic, we found that we had brought the wrong spares. We must have looked pretty sorry for ourselves since the mechanic, Francisco, lit a charcoal brazier to dry our sodden clothes and, having offered us accommodation on the workshop floor, proceeded to bedeck the fire with the beginnings of surely the greatest barbecue in the history of mankind. Soon the heady gin-like Chilean national drink of Pisco made an appearance, and the rest of the evening is a blur. Los Angeles marked a change of fortune, and on the road to the capital, Santiago, we received just one more severe drenching. Indeed, from Santiago onwards we experienced only five minutes of light drizzle in the next 3,500 miles. After a short spell in the dull Europeanised capital it was a relief to head up the rugged winding Pacific coast Easy Rider-style in bright sunshine. Soon, the scenery metamorphosed from grassland to scrub, from scrub to cactus and from cactus to sand, and we found ourselves on the edge of the driest desert in the world. The Atacama desert is not to be taken lightly, and certainly not on motorbikes with a meagre 100-mile range, so we acquired spare jerry cans and extra water bottles in the picturesque colonial centre of La Serena. The town was founded in 1544 by the Spanish conquistador Juan Buhon following his hellish crossing of the Atacama, in which more than half the conquistadors and their native slaves died. It was with some trepidation that we headed for the desert. In the bleak wastes of the Atacama, the shimmering road ahead was our only link with civilisation. Throughout the day we passed ghost towns, roofless houses alone in the desolate haze. In the breathless midday heat we stopped at one of these old nitrate mining settlements, Officina Edwards. Searching for shade in one of its crumbling buildings, the interior walls still painted a faded yellow and maroon, we found an immaculate 1920s child's leather shoe, delicately stitched and nailed, perfectly preserved in the dry air. Through a paneless, shutterless window, out across the hot sand, a solitary cross marked a forgotten grave. We sat listlessly in the relentless heat, sipping our precious water and tried to imagine the harsh life of the mining families that the dusty remains once housed. It was in the desert wastes that Che, (like any a good prophet should) had one of the revelations that shaped his life. One bitterly cold night spent sharing a \"miserable blanket\" with a persecuted communist miner and his wife was an experience that made Che feel closer, really for the first time, to the marginalised people he would later come to fight for: those he then termed this \"strange, for me at least, human species\". Back on the road, we pushed on across a barren expanse of flat, grey desert bounded by the spectacular volcanoes that mark Chile's border with Bolivia; at the oasis village of San Pedro de Atacama we left the road behind. We felt truly free bumping along the rutted gravely tracks. The dust billowed out behind us and there was nothing in sight except parched bare-backed mountains that rose up from the plain. That night, we had no need to erect our ponchos as we found our way into the Valley of the Moon, a fantastic selection of wind sculpted rocks and dunes. Nevertheless, real adventure beckoned, and we set course for the El Tatio geyser field on the side of one of the distant volcanoes that mark the border with Bolivia. The road was terrible, and we bounced and shook our way upwards throughout the day, the air becoming thinner and colder by the minute. It proved to be the most spec tacular period of riding we had experienced. When we reached the geysers in the late afternoon we were exhausted but elated. We had made it to 15,000 feet on our struggling bikes, vicu\u00f1as (wild relations of the llama) running out in front of us from frozen lakes, the dust from their hooves hanging ghostlike in the cold dry air long after our passing. The geysers turned out to be gently bubbling steaming pools in which we boiled eggs for breakfast, frozen and feeling like death because of altitude sickness. Much as we would have liked to stay to appreciate the stunning scenery, we feared for our health and hastily descended. Back on the main roads we made speedy progress towards mountainous Peru. The sun shone brightly everyday, and although the desert nights were bitterly cold, we could sleep without shelter by the side of our bikes. Peru proved completely different to anything we had expected. Within 60 miles of the border we were ascending steadily on ancient roads, little more than donkey tracks, through a land that time had forgotten, epitomised by the ruins of the Inca citadel of Machu Picchu. Three months after setting out, we made it into the polluted heart of Lima, our faces looking like chimney sweeps from all the soot we had accumulated in our helmets along the way. In Lima, Che stayed with a famous leprologist, Dr Hugo Pesce and was greatly moved by the patients he met there. He later headed north into the jungle, where he spent his 24th birthday with the leprosy patients of the San Pablo colony on the Amazon; Che was on the cusp of his true vocation. \u0095BBC Radio 4 will broadcast the story of Ben and Karl's journey on Tuesday at 11am as part of its six-part series of travellers' stories, Tales from the Back of Beyond.

      "body": "<p>If your idea of surfing involves sitting in front of a television, you could do your body and soul a few favours by flicking the off button, getting up from the sofa and heading to the coast to try the real thing instead. </p> <p>Of course, you might justifiably ask why anyone should want to surf the cold, grey waters of the British Isles, but the surf isn't always that unwelcoming: from May to October, it's just as likely to be bright and blue and, with a good wetsuit, it'll even feel warm(ish). </p> <p>The search for waves will take you to some of the most beautiful stretches of coastline in Europe. Add to that the improved fitness to be gained from an aerobic work-out of paddling out through the waves, scrambling to your feet, riding the curl and being tumbled underwater by the inevitable wipe-outs, and you have two good reasons to surf in the UK. </p> <p>But in order to make the most of Britain's fickle waves, you need to know where to go and when. All committed surfers can read an Atlantic weather chart and predict what the surf will be like days in advance, but there are several websites and phone numbers you can dial for a surf check (see below). </p> <p>Once you know there's surf on the way, here are five of the best spots to head for, whether you're a complete beginner or the Silver Surfer. </p> <p><strong> Newquay</strong><br> Crammed to the gills with egos and wannabes, and undoubtedly the most overhyped surf spot on this side of the planet, Newquay is still a good place to try the sport simply because the town has everything you need, from surf schools and shops with board hire, to several beaches with the most consistent waves in Britain. </p> <p>The most favoured beach for beginners is Fistral, the venue for international surf contests, but other popular beaches include Towan, Great Western and the superbly-named Lusty Glaze. </p> <p>The waves are always crowded but you'll see a high standard of surfing as some of Britain's best exponents of the sport are based in Newquay, and you'll also get to see the British surf scene at its most vibrant (or ridiculous, depending on your age and point of view). </p> <p> <strong> Surf schools:</strong> West Coast Surfari (01637 876083) and Dolphin Surf School (07974 629381). There are no end of caf\u00e9s close to the beaches and in the town, and popular surfer's pubs in Newquay include the Red Lion above Towan and the Sailor's Arms in Fore Street. If the surf isn't thrilling enough for you, there's shark fishing - yet another attempt by the locals to try to convince you that this is anywhere but Britain. </p> <p><strong> Llangennith, Gower Peninsula</strong><br> A huge beach of golden sand that attracts everyone from complete beginners to experts. There's a surf school at the beach (the village of Llangennith is about half a mile inland) and the local surf shop is run by Welsh surf legend and former international competitor Pete Jones. </p> <p>Llangennith is a mellow version of Fistral: less crowded, with a wide variety of surfers vying for the waves, and, in general, there's a friendly, laid-back atmosphere. The place seems to be particularly popular with students, especially during term-time when they pile in from nearby Swansea University. </p> <p>When the waves aren't too big, the beach is ideal for novice surfers. However, during larger swells there are endless lines of white water to paddle out through, which even the fittest of surfers can have trouble negotiating. In these conditions, try one of the other beaches on the Gower that will have more manageable waves. </p> <p> <strong> Surf schools:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.britsurf.org/wsf/surf-school.html\">The Welsh Surfing Federation Surf School</a> (01792 386426) operates from Llangennith. The King's Head in the village has good food and beer, and there's a caf\u00e9 and shop at Hillend Caravan Park above the beach. Take time out from the waves to walk to the top of Rhossili Downs above the beach, from where there are great views of much of South Wales and across the Bristol Channel to Devon and Somerset. </p> <p><strong> Saltburn, Cleveland</strong><br> The grey - okay, steel blue - waters of the North Sea are not the first place that springs to mind when you think of surfing, but the coast around the toytown village of Saltburn has some of the best and most challenging surf in Britain. </p> <p>The beach has waves that are ideal for beginners and intermediates, breaking to the right of the old Victorian pier, while further south along the beach are a couple of more powerful breaks that are best left to more experienced surfers. </p> <p>Travel north or south of Saltburn and you'll find some of the best reef and point breaks in the country but, true to the tradition of the sport, these \"secret\" spots can't be mentioned here, otherwise the locals will ensure I never surf again. </p> <p> <strong> Surf schools:</strong> Saltburn Surf Shop (01287 625321) above the beach can provide both lessons and equipment, and apr\u00e9s-surf food and drink are available from the Ship Inn and Bailey's. Just inland are the North York Moors, great for hiking or mountain biking, and a few miles down the coast is the attractive former whaling port of Whitby. </p> <p><strong> Portrush, County Antrim</strong><br> I first surfed this stretch of coastline last year, and I was blown away by both the waves and the beauty of the area. The pretty beaches of West and East Strand at Portrush are ideal for all standards of surfer, and have a great backdrop in the form of Donegal's Inishowen Peninsula. West Strand also has a good reef break for experienced surfers, while in powerful swells East Strand is a heavy wave suitable for good surfers. </p> <p>According to Andy Hill, of Troggs Surf Shop, the whole of the Causeway Coast has excellent and consistent waves and, if you time your visit right, it's unlikely you'd come away without enjoying a few quality sessions. </p> <p> <strong> Surf schools:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.troggs.com\">Troggs Surf Shop</a> (02870 825476) is the biggest surf shop in Ireland, offers surf lessons and provides a local surf report on 09061 337770. The Hidden Cove next to the surf shop is a good place for an apr\u00e9s-surf fry-up, and the Harbour Bar serves good food and beer. While in the area, take time to visit the amazing basalt columns of the Giant's Causeway, and maybe Bushmills Distillery, both just a few miles east of Portrush. </p> <p><strong> Thurso, Caithness</strong><br> Castle Reef at Thurso (also known as Thurso East) is regarded as one of the best reef breaks in Europe. Despite the cold, peat-brown waters and fickle climate, adventurous surfers from all over the world arrive here to sample its famous wave. </p> <p>This is for expert surfers only, breaking heavily over flat slabs of Caithness sandstone, but there are smaller waves on the nearby beach that less experienced surfers will enjoy. </p> <p>The whole of the coastline of northern Scotland is pounded by waves, which vary from the reefs at Brimms Ness - even more challenging than Castle Reef - to the more mellow beach breaks around Durness. And, if it should go flat, there's plenty of magnificent coastline and mountain scenery to explore. </p> <p> <strong> Apr\u00e9s surf:</strong> For accommodation and food, try Sandra's Backpackers Hostel, Princes Street (01847 894575). A popular bar is Top Joe's on Trail Street, and if you find yourself in the area without a board and wetsuit you can hire basic versions of each from Harper's Fishing Tackle, 57 High Street (01847 893179). There is no surf-shop in the town though. </p> <p><strong> Top tips </strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Look for a British Surfing Association Approved Surf School.

      "body": "<p>It's so nice to be beside the seaside. Nicer when half the country has flown abroad. And downright heavenly when the beach you're on is flying a Blue Flag. This year, a record 57 British resort beaches are boasting the eco-label of beach excellence, a huge improvement on our meagre 17 winners back in 1992. </p> <p>The EC Blue Flag is the definitive guide to clean beaches in Europe. Wherever you see the flag flying, you can rest assured that the beach has passed the most stringent tests on management and safety, with its results on rigorous water quality tests clearly displayed for all swimmers, surfers and paddlers to read. Take five: </p> <p><strong> Tenby South Beach, South Wales</strong><br> If you go to Tenby by train or car, go out and come back in again by foot, just for the glorious view of the town reclining below the steeple of St Mary's, its harbour embraced by Georgian colour-washed terraces and a tumble of cliffs. </p> <p>On one side of Tenby's limestone shelf lies North Beach. Blue-flagged South Beach, on the other flank, sweeps away into the haze, its hemline marked by the Burrows, a richly-vegetated parade of dunes. When you feel hungry, dive into the kasbah of narrow streets and Georgian frontages, and you'll arrive at Fecci's for a choice of hake, whiting, cod, haddock, scampi, mussels, sole, plaice or salmon and chips. Around the corner you'll find their ice-cream parlour, where knickerbocker glories come in glasses the size of traffic cones. </p> <p>The on-the-doorstep National Park Pembrokeshire coastline is all yours, barring the odd convention of seagulls. </p> <p>For more information, including details of the half dozen hotels on the Esplanade overlooking South Beach, contact the tourist office on 01834 842402. </p> <p><strong> Woolacombe, north Devon</strong><br> The abundance of \"golden\", \"sandy\" and \"cove\" hotel signs are some indication as to the character of this favourite stretch of north Devon coast. Woolacombe, shy little sister to bolder Ilfracombe, has been flying a Blue Flag on its beach since 1991. The beach is a proper sandcastle affair, the colour of clotted cream and more than big enough to cater for the regular influx of both families and surfers. A lucky few will be commuting down to the waves from the parade of gaily-painted wooden beach huts (\u00a310 a day, \u00a350 a week from Parkin Estates (01271 870234); others from the Beachcomber Caf\u00e9, which serves meals from breakfast through to afternoon tea, along with more mobile refreshment outlets. </p> <p>The northern end is the humming end, where Woolacombe's main Esplanade is lined with shops, caf\u00e9s and copious B&amp;Bs, guesthouses and self-catering apartments. Here are the rockpools, too, where for a nominal fee visitors can join the Devon Wildlife Trust's rockpool rambles (dates are posted up in the tourist office on the beachfront, 01271 870553). Down at the southern tip is Baggy Point, which only revs up when local gannets, shags, cormorants and shearwaters arrive for their autumn conventions. </p> <p><strong> St Andrews West Sands, Fife, Scotland</strong><br> Tee off on the famous St Andrews Links Golf Courses and you'll be overlooking West Sands, a delightful, two-mile stretch of sand backed by dunes, pounded by the North Sea and within easy striking distance of the town centre. You may recognise it from the running scenes in the film Chariots of Fire - at low tide, the beach is flat and enormous. As you walk up towards the Tay Estuary, and towards the walking/ cycling trails of the Forest of Tentsmuir, you'll have the sands to yourself. The only crowds that gather here are for summer Friday sandcastle competitions. </p> <p>St Andrews resort is a heady mix of golfers, medieval ruins, tourist schmaltz and undergraduate buzz. The ruins of the Cathedral and Castle have been preserved as far as possible, and there's plenty to do between the Botanic Gardens, Craigtown Country Park, the Byre Theatre and the huge Sea Life Centre, with more on the second Monday and Tuesday in August when the Lammas Fair packs the centre with stalls and amusements. </p> <p> The Fife Tourist Office (01334 472021) can proudly provide details on all three of Scotland's Blue Flag beach winners, including accommodation. And usefully, the university (01334 462000) rents out about 200 rooms in various locations on a B&amp;B basis over the summer. </p> <p><strong> Benone Strand, Co Londonderry</strong><br> Any beach that attracts regular horse-riders must have something going for it. The award-winning seven-mile stretch of fine white sand at Benone runs from Magilligan Point to Downhill. Sheltered by dramatic 750ft cliffs, it's also ideal for picnicking families. </p> <p>The easiest place to stay, a hop, skip and jump from the sands, is the Radisson Roe Park Hotel and Golf Resort (028 777 22222), currently offering two-nights for \u00a399pp including B&amp;B and one evening meal. </p> <p>The market town of Limavady is just down the road, where the Londonderry Air (aka Danny Boy) is said to have originated in 1851 when local girl Jane Moss jotted down the melody after hearing a blind fiddler play it in the street. </p> <p>The waterways of the river Roe provide plenty of pretty riverside walks as well as good salmon and trout fishing in nearby Roe Valley Country Park. </p> <p> Return flights from London Stansted to Derry with Ryanair (0870 1569569) start at \u00a375pp. If you wish to join the horse-riders or book alternative accommodation, details are available from the tourist office on 0870 1555250. </p> <p><strong> Cromer, north Norfolk</strong><br> North Norfolk is a long way from anywhere and not on the way to anywhere else. But its insularity lies at the root of what makes it special. Cromer, sitting right on the bulge that juts into The Wash, was a highly fashionable Victorian resort that came and went with the coming and going of the railways. Today it's a favourite with loyal Norfolk devotees, its shingle-cum-sandy Blue Flag beach backed by a long promenade. There's crabbing and caf\u00e9s for children, various gardens for grown-ups like North Lodge Park and Sunken Gardens up on the cliffs, and a breezy two-mile walk along to Cromer Lighthouse. </p> <p>No visitor to the beach can miss the pier. One hundred years old, and recently voted Pier of the Year 2000, Cromer Pier boasts the lifeboat boathouse and, more importantly, the famous Pavilion Theatre. </p> <p>After a supper at Mary Jane's - an excellent plate of haddock, chips and mushy peas - take your seat at Pavilion's Seaside Special, the last surviving end-of-the-pier variety show, keeping alive a tradition that has long given way to amusement arcades (box office: 01263 512495). The Hotel de Paris (01263 513141), a listed, art-nouveau-meets-Dralon hotel on the clifftops, is the closest the coast gets to having a proper Grand. For a full accommodation list, contact the tourist office on 01263 512497. </p> <p> A complete list of UK BlueFlag beaches and resorts is available from the Tidy Britain Goup, 5 Chalk Hill House, 19 Rosary Road, Norwich NR11SZ, tel: 01603 766076 (9am - 5pm). A brochure listing beaches that have been awarded the Seaside Award, which are safe to bathe in, is also available. </p> <p><strong>Further details</strong></p> <p> For more information, including details of the half dozen hotels on the Esplanade overlooking South Beach, contact the tourist office on 01834 842402. </p> <p> The Fife Tourist Office (01334 472021) can proudly provide details on all three of Scotland's Blue Flag beach winners, including accommodation.

For more information, including details of the half dozen hotels on the Esplanade overlooking South Beach, contact the tourist office on 01834 842402. Woolacombe, north Devon The abundance of \"golden\", \"sandy\" and \"cove\" hotel signs are some indication as to the character of this favourite stretch of north Devon coast. Woolacombe, shy little sister to bolder Ilfracombe, has been flying a Blue Flag on its beach since 1991. The beach is a proper sandcastle affair, the colour of clotted cream and more than big enough to cater for the regular influx of both families and surfers. A lucky few will be commuting down to the waves from the parade of gaily-painted wooden beach huts (\u00a310 a day, \u00a350 a week from Parkin Estates (01271 870234); others from the Beachcomber Caf\u00e9, which serves meals from breakfast through to afternoon tea, along with more mobile refreshment outlets. The northern end is the humming end, where Woolacombe's main Esplanade is lined with shops, caf\u00e9s and copious B&amp;Bs, guesthouses and self-catering apartments. Here are the rockpools, too, where for a nominal fee visitors can join the Devon Wildlife Trust's rockpool rambles (dates are posted up in the tourist office on the beachfront, 01271 870553). Down at the southern tip is Baggy Point, which only revs up when local gannets, shags, cormorants and shearwaters arrive for their autumn conventions. St Andrews West Sands, Fife, Scotland Tee off on the famous St Andrews Links Golf Courses and you'll be overlooking West Sands, a delightful, two-mile stretch of sand backed by dunes, pounded by the North Sea and within easy striking distance of the town centre. You may recognise it from the running scenes in the film Chariots of Fire - at low tide, the beach is flat and enormous. As you walk up towards the Tay Estuary, and towards the walking/ cycling trails of the Forest of Tentsmuir, you'll have the sands to yourself. The only crowds that gather here are for summer Friday sandcastle competitions. St Andrews resort is a heady mix of golfers, medieval ruins, tourist schmaltz and undergraduate buzz. The ruins of the Cathedral and Castle have been preserved as far as possible, and there's plenty to do between the Botanic Gardens, Craigtown Country Park, the Byre Theatre and the huge Sea Life Centre, with more on the second Monday and Tuesday in August when the Lammas Fair packs the centre with stalls and amusements. The Fife Tourist Office (01334 472021) can proudly provide details on all three of Scotland's Blue Flag beach winners, including accommodation. And usefully, the university (01334 462000) rents out about 200 rooms in various locations on a B&amp;B basis over the summer. Benone Strand, Co Londonderry Any beach that attracts regular horse-riders must have something going for it. The award-winning seven-mile stretch of fine white sand at Benone runs from Magilligan Point to Downhill. Sheltered by dramatic 750ft cliffs, it's also ideal for picnicking families. The easiest place to stay, a hop, skip and jump from the sands, is the Radisson Roe Park Hotel and Golf Resort (028 777 22222), currently offering two-nights for \u00a399pp including B&amp;B and one evening meal. The market town of Limavady is just down the road, where the Londonderry Air (aka Danny Boy) is said to have originated in 1851 when local girl Jane Moss jotted down the melody after hearing a blind fiddler play it in the street. The waterways of the river Roe provide plenty of pretty riverside walks as well as good salmon and trout fishing in nearby Roe Valley Country Park. Return flights from London Stansted to Derry with Ryanair (0870 1569569) start at \u00a375pp. If you wish to join the horse-riders or book alternative accommodation, details are available from the tourist office on 0870 1555250. Cromer, north Norfolk North Norfolk is a long way from anywhere and not on the way to anywhere else. But its insularity lies at the root of what makes it special. Cromer, sitting right on the bulge that juts into The Wash, was a highly fashionable Victorian resort that came and went with the coming and going of the railways. Today it's a favourite with loyal Norfolk devotees, its shingle-cum-sandy Blue Flag beach backed by a long promenade. There's crabbing and caf\u00e9s for children, various gardens for grown-ups like North Lodge Park and Sunken Gardens up on the cliffs, and a breezy two-mile walk along to Cromer Lighthouse. No visitor to the beach can miss the pier. One hundred years old, and recently voted Pier of the Year 2000, Cromer Pier boasts the lifeboat boathouse and, more importantly, the famous Pavilion Theatre. After a supper at Mary Jane's - an excellent plate of haddock, chips and mushy peas - take your seat at Pavilion's Seaside Special, the last surviving end-of-the-pier variety show, keeping alive a tradition that has long given way to amusement arcades (box office: 01263 512495). The Hotel de Paris (01263 513141), a listed, art-nouveau-meets-Dralon hotel on the clifftops, is the closest the coast gets to having a proper Grand. For a full accommodation list, contact the tourist office on 01263 512497. A complete list of UK BlueFlag beaches and resorts is available from the Tidy Britain Goup, 5 Chalk Hill House, 19 Rosary Road, Norwich NR11SZ, tel: 01603 766076 (9am - 5pm). A brochure listing beaches that have been awarded the Seaside Award, which are safe to bathe in, is also available.

      "body": "<p>There may be more agreeable ways to spend a summer Friday afternoon than having your boyfriend knock off work at lunchtime and come and pick you up in his jalopy for a motorvating trip to the West Country but, especially as I get older, I can't think of any. </p> <p>There is something about the word \"West\" - True West, Go West, Westward Ho! - that makes one feel light-hearted. As we drove along the arterial roads from Brighton, more and more cars with surfboards and/or boats on board started showing up, until there was this great rushing feeling of communal westerly pleasure-seeking. As Sussex becomes Hampshire and Dorset, Devon and Cornwall seem to call you on like sirens with silly names - Poxwell, Piddlehinton, Plush - you become part of the weekend exodus of the south-east's jaded and affluent in search of their land of lost content. </p> <p>It's a long drive from Brighton to Torquay - four hours - but even at such a moment of radiant happiness, there is always the spiteful satisfaction of knowing that those surfers and boaters heading for Cornwall have got even further to go. Devon is Cornwall's polite neighbour, and what it lacks in rugged beauty it makes up for in sheer prettiness. This is especially true of the section of the south Devon coast known, somewhat hopefully, as \"the English Riviera\" - Brixham, Paignton and my own El Dorado, Torquay. </p> <p>There is a theory about female pulchritude which says that beauty and prettiness have nothing to do with each other, but when you look at Marilyn Monroe you know it's not true. Sometimes prettiness held for an extremely long beat can become beauty, as it did in Marilyn and as it does at Torquay. She wasn't a real blonde and it's not really the Riviera, but when it looks that good, who cares? </p> <p>I've been to the Bahamas and the Maldives in the line of duty, but I'd rather go to Torquay any day; the best way I can assure you of my sincerity is to point out that since I became a travel writer, Torquay is the only place I've actually paid to go to, not once but four times. Those of you familiar with my roaming oeuvre will recall the existence of an internal machine, which I call my Torquameter; that is, if a place resembles Torquay (L'Ile Rousse, Madeira) I always love it, but if it doesn't (the Grand Canyon) I don't. Yet ever since Fawlty Towers, this matchless town has been a byword for rinky-dink naffness. On the contrary, he who is tired of Torquay is truly tired of life and should scurry back to London as soon as possible, as keeping his nose to the grindstone and making his pile is truly all he is fit for. </p> <p>Torquay is so cool, yet so hot; I know that, logically, it can't always be warm there, but I've never been when the weather has been less than glorious. In many English towns such a plethora of palm trees would look ridiculous; here they look perfectly appropriate, and the English Riviera shtick seems pretty apt, if a little campy. Even during this wet and dreary summer, the July weekend we were there - when Brighton cringed under a gunmetal sky - it was the hottest place in the British Isles, at 22C. </p> <p>Nevertheless, I don't think I'd like Torquay quite as much if not for the existence of the Imperial Hotel, a five-star heaven which stands on a cliff overlooking Torbay - as grand and other-worldly as the Overlook in The Shining (albeit without unpleasing and murderous aspects), yet only five minutes' walk from the bright and breezy town centre. </p> <p>In my book, the test of a truly great hotel is if you would still want to stay there if it was in a nasty place rather than a nice one. Like Pink Sands in the Bahamas and Reid's Palace in Madeira, the Imperial would still be worth visiting if it was set on the middle of a blasted moor in Yorkshire - the food, service and atmosphere are that good. I am a hotel junkie, and would much rather stay in a good hotel in a nasty place than a bad hotel in a nice one, but at the Imperial the two worlds collide and you find yourself in the lap of luxury overlooking the most beautiful bay in England from acres of tropical gardens with excel lent beaches on either side. One of them, Livermead Beach, has had the Blue Flag for the past 20 years and is reached along a winding National Trust pathway; the other, Torre Abbey Sands, is not so much to look at in the natural beauty stakes, but is cheap and cheerful with the added advantage of being adjacent to the caf\u00e9s and restaurants of the town. </p> <p>But to me the real beauty of Torquay is the boat culture. In Brighton, shamefully, it is easier to buy a gramme of smack than to get taken out commercially on a boat; the yachts are all docked at the town's remote and ugly marina and commercial boat hire is non-viable simply because people don't want to have to travel miles from the beach whenever they get a yen for a bit of life on the ocean waves.

      "bodyText": "There may be more agreeable ways to spend a summer Friday afternoon than having your boyfriend knock off work at lunchtime and come and pick you up in his jalopy for a motorvating trip to the West Country but, especially as I get older, I can't think of any. There is something about the word \"West\" - True West, Go West, Westward Ho! - that makes one feel light-hearted. As we drove along the arterial roads from Brighton, more and more cars with surfboards and/or boats on board started showing up, until there was this great rushing feeling of communal westerly pleasure-seeking. As Sussex becomes Hampshire and Dorset, Devon and Cornwall seem to call you on like sirens with silly names - Poxwell, Piddlehinton, Plush - you become part of the weekend exodus of the south-east's jaded and affluent in search of their land of lost content. It's a long drive from Brighton to Torquay - four hours - but even at such a moment of radiant happiness, there is always the spiteful satisfaction of knowing that those surfers and boaters heading for Cornwall have got even further to go. Devon is Cornwall's polite neighbour, and what it lacks in rugged beauty it makes up for in sheer prettiness. This is especially true of the section of the south Devon coast known, somewhat hopefully, as \"the English Riviera\" - Brixham, Paignton and my own El Dorado, Torquay. There is a theory about female pulchritude which says that beauty and prettiness have nothing to do with each other, but when you look at Marilyn Monroe you know it's not true. Sometimes prettiness held for an extremely long beat can become beauty, as it did in Marilyn and as it does at Torquay. She wasn't a real blonde and it's not really the Riviera, but when it looks that good, who cares? I've been to the Bahamas and the Maldives in the line of duty, but I'd rather go to Torquay any day; the best way I can assure you of my sincerity is to point out that since I became a travel writer, Torquay is the only place I've actually paid to go to, not once but four times. Those of you familiar with my roaming oeuvre will recall the existence of an internal machine, which I call my Torquameter; that is, if a place resembles Torquay (L'Ile Rousse, Madeira) I always love it, but if it doesn't (the Grand Canyon) I don't. Yet ever since Fawlty Towers, this matchless town has been a byword for rinky-dink naffness. On the contrary, he who is tired of Torquay is truly tired of life and should scurry back to London as soon as possible, as keeping his nose to the grindstone and making his pile is truly all he is fit for. Torquay is so cool, yet so hot; I know that, logically, it can't always be warm there, but I've never been when the weather has been less than glorious. In many English towns such a plethora of palm trees would look ridiculous; here they look perfectly appropriate, and the English Riviera shtick seems pretty apt, if a little campy. Even during this wet and dreary summer, the July weekend we were there - when Brighton cringed under a gunmetal sky - it was the hottest place in the British Isles, at 22C. Nevertheless, I don't think I'd like Torquay quite as much if not for the existence of the Imperial Hotel, a five-star heaven which stands on a cliff overlooking Torbay - as grand and other-worldly as the Overlook in The Shining (albeit without unpleasing and murderous aspects), yet only five minutes' walk from the bright and breezy town centre. In my book, the test of a truly great hotel is if you would still want to stay there if it was in a nasty place rather than a nice one. Like Pink Sands in the Bahamas and Reid's Palace in Madeira, the Imperial would still be worth visiting if it was set on the middle of a blasted moor in Yorkshire - the food, service and atmosphere are that good. I am a hotel junkie, and would much rather stay in a good hotel in a nasty place than a bad hotel in a nice one, but at the Imperial the two worlds collide and you find yourself in the lap of luxury overlooking the most beautiful bay in England from acres of tropical gardens with excel lent beaches on either side. One of them, Livermead Beach, has had the Blue Flag for the past 20 years and is reached along a winding National Trust pathway; the other, Torre Abbey Sands, is not so much to look at in the natural beauty stakes, but is cheap and cheerful with the added advantage of being adjacent to the caf\u00e9s and restaurants of the town. But to me the real beauty of Torquay is the boat culture. In Brighton, shamefully, it is easier to buy a gramme of smack than to get taken out commercially on a boat; the yachts are all docked at the town's remote and ugly marina and commercial boat hire is non-viable simply because people don't want to have to travel miles from the beach whenever they get a yen for a bit of life on the ocean waves. Walk down the hill from the Imperial, though, and within a few minutes every sort of boat is proffered for your pleasure: fishing trips, night cruises, all-day cruises along the River Dart stopping off at the sleepy towns of deep Devon and, best of all, the scores of white-knuckle speedboats driven by bronzed buccaneers - honestly, you haven't lived until you've ridden on the Rigid Raider. Like sex in Phuket or trinkets in Cairo, boats are thrust in your face every time you step out on to the street in Torquay and, considering that we are an island race, it seems strange and sad that this should be the exception in seaside towns rather than the norm. To cap it all, after spending a fortune in various exotic locales on boat trips that promised dolphins a-plenty to spy on, the one time it actually happened was in Torquay, on an ordinary five-quid speed-boat ride last year. We were expecting to get a pleasant but basically tame view of the bay, heard splashing behind us and turned round to see a leaping shoal of the grinning fiends. Boating completed, get off your face at the brilliant Caf\u00e9 Mambo on the lethal BBC TV cocktails (brandy, Bacardi, Cointreau, Tia Maria and vodka) and be thoroughly unsettled by the palm- reading powers of Gypsy Eva Petulengro, who told me EVERYTHING about myself (I'm talking real four-in-the-morning confessions that only a mother or an agent would be privy to), finishing off with something I'd always suspected, horribly, about myself: that I had known great professional success, but that my real talent was for making Mah Maaan happy. Well, there's no point in fighting it, then. By now, you'll be totally boated-out, drunk and spooked, so stagger up the short hill to the Imperial and slob out by the perfect outdoor swimming-pool set into the cliffs. (It is a mark of the excellent climate here that in five years I have never once used the Imperial's indoor pool, splendid-looking though it is). By the pool you will get a taste of just how brilliant the service is here; the staff will ask casually if you want anything as they stroll by, but there is a complete absence of the obsequiousness that, appallingly, is now the norm in many parts of the world where Americans go on holiday and where the indigenous people have been groomed accordingly.

Your sunstroke will ease off the minute you step back into the cool depths of the cavernous marble interior, which has seen a few changes since its opening in 1866, but still retains the basic grandeur that attracted the likes of Napoleon III, George VII and Howard Marks at the height of his powers.

It's tempting to imagine that this is the darkly decorated home of his friend Goya. Perez looks happy - he doesn't appear subdued by the shadows. On the contrary, he is extremely relaxed, arms loosely folded, face open and humorous. There's a light in the painting that enlivens the subject; with his bright, intelligent face and white shirt, Perez illuminates the night. </p> <p>Goya satirised and lamented life in Spain in the age of the French Revolution. As he grew older, he moved further and further away from the traditional system of court painting and commissioned portraiture - a system in which he had risen to the top, becoming court painter to the Spanish royal family.

      "bodyText": "\u00b7 View the work online Artist: Francisco Goya (1746-1828), the first modern painter, who painted and engraved everything from the glitz of aristocratic life to the horrors of the Spanish Peninsular War. Subject: Tiburcio Perez y Cuervo (born 1785), an architect and close friend of Goya. Distinguishing features: Perez stands in a dark, monochrome space. It's tempting to imagine that this is the darkly decorated home of his friend Goya. Perez looks happy - he doesn't appear subdued by the shadows. On the contrary, he is extremely relaxed, arms loosely folded, face open and humorous. There's a light in the painting that enlivens the subject; with his bright, intelligent face and white shirt, Perez illuminates the night. Goya satirised and lamented life in Spain in the age of the French Revolution. As he grew older, he moved further and further away from the traditional system of court painting and commissioned portraiture - a system in which he had risen to the top, becoming court painter to the Spanish royal family. Instead, he concentrated on private statements; and he made engravings to sell on the open market. In 1819 he moved to his country house outside Madrid, nicknamed The House of the Deaf Man (Goya went deaf after an illness in the early 1790s), and from 1820 to 1823 he covered its walls with scary, mystifying murals: a dog drowning in quicksand, giants fighting, the god Saturn eating his son_ The portrait of Perez dates from this time and was executed in the same sombre palette. Perhaps Goya - who painted this portrait by choice, not to a commission - wanted to say that in the desolate world depicted in the black paintings, he still saw light and hope in a man like Perez. Evidently this is an expression of personal friendship; Goya painted portraits of his friends throughout his career. But there's a larger dimension to this luminescent portrayal. Goya was a reformer and radical. He saw himself as a man of the Enlightenment, part of a widespread movement by intellectuals and educated aristocrats to drag Spain kicking and screaming into the 18th century. Perez is typical of the enlightened figures to whom Goya dedicated his most friendly portraits: politicians, artists, writers - rationalists all. (They even wanted to ban bullfighting.) But their vision of a modern country was obliterated in the Napoleonic wars, and Goya's prints and black paintings depict what he called the \"sleep of reason.\" This is a relaxed portrait, but it is also monumental. Where Goya had made a conventional military hero like the Duke of Wellington - in a portrait that hangs in the National Gallery (1812-14) - look very ordinary, he makes Tiburcio Perez y Cuervo a hero: a lighthouse in a mad night. Inspirations and influences: The directness and informality of the way Goya paints Perez has much in common with William Hogarth's portraits of enlightened contemporaries like the philanthropist Captain Coram (1740) or Sir Joshua Reynolds' intimate celebration of the novelist Laurence Sterne (1760). Goya's passionate championing of fellow intellectuals and reformers had a huge influence on modern portraiture, from Manet's Emile Zola (1868) to Picasso's Gertrude Stein (1905-6). Where is it?

She was a perfectly fit, 90-year-old when she left my house in Ashby-de-La-Zouch on Friday, July 14, at 1.15pm. I am being specific about details because Eunice, Mrs Wormington's daughter- in-law, has just left this house after calling to collect the dead one's belongings. She accused me of sending \"an ailing woman to the east coast, to die\". </p> <p> It was only after she had driven off in her Reliant Robin that I realised that she was virtually accusing me of murder. I immediately called my mother, who is an acknowledged expert on litigation (she haunts the small-claims court). She advised me to seek the advice of her solicitor, Charlie Dovecote. It cost me \u00a350, plus VAT, to be told by Dovecote that allowing a nonagenarian to ride a donkey in a stiff east wind may have been foolhardy, but did not constitute murder. </p> <p> I found a bundle of old letters under Mrs Wormington's mattress when I stripped her bed. I was glad that the horrible Eunice had missed them. </p> <p> <strong> October 21, 1917 </strong></p> <p> Dear Sergeant Palmer, </p> <p> I hope you are now settled into your new quarters in Ypres and that the weather is pleasant. We hear most marvellous reports of General Haig's leadership from the newspapers. I am glad that you are in such safe hands. Thank you for asking me to call you Cedric. However, I feel it is far too early in our friendship for such intimacy. We have only known each other for a year. </p> <p> Yours with best wishes, Miss Broadway </p> <p> This, I presume, was Mrs Wormington's maiden name. Social intercourse was conducted with such delicacy in those days. It's no wonder that Mrs Wormington was shocked at Denise Van Outen's grubby little TV show. Even I, an admirer of the female breast, begin to tire of prime-time mammaries. </p> <p> <strong> Thursday, July 20 </strong></p> <p> William wanted to know where Mrs Wormington had gone. I said she had gone on a long journey to a place where she would be in peace. I went on a bit, about Mrs Wormington running up hills and picking wild flowers under the warming rays of the sun, etc. Perhaps I went too far down the pastoral path, because when William was watching Glenn clean his roller-blade boots I heard him say, \"Mrs Wormington's not dead, Glenn. She's gone to live in Teletubby Land.\" </p> <p><strong> Friday, July 21 </strong></p> <p> A car in which Jack Straw was being conveyed was stopped by police for speeding at 103mph. I hope the full might of the law is brought to bear on the miscreant. I am still smarting from the tirade of abuse I received from a traffic policeman because I drove at 32mph in Foxglove Avenue, a 30mph zone. When I remarked, humorously, \"I'm not exactly Jeremy Clarkson\", the policeman sneered, \"No, he's taller, got more hair, and is almost certainly richer and more famous than you are, sir.\" I thought of reporting him to the Police Complaints Board, but wasn't sure if sarcasm counted as assault - though I still feel hurt by it. </p> <p> <strong> Saturday, July 22 </strong></p> <p> I went to see Pandora at the MP's surgery today. I wanted to talk to her about my theory that Mr Blair has secretly embarked on a course of hormones that will transform him from Tony to Toni. I reminded her that he'd recently stated that he disliked wearing a suit. </p> <p> \"Don't be so bloody ridiculous,\" she snapped. \"Get out and give your seat to a constituent with a genuine problem.\" I pointed out that there was nobody else waiting to see her. \"Apathetic bastards,\" she raged of the electorate. \"I could have stayed in London and picked up my bowling bag from Prada.\" </p> <p> I had no idea she'd taken up such a middle-aged, boring sport.</p>",

She accused me of sending \"an ailing woman to the east coast, to die\". It was only after she had driven off in her Reliant Robin that I realised that she was virtually accusing me of murder. I immediately called my mother, who is an acknowledged expert on litigation (she haunts the small-claims court). She advised me to seek the advice of her solicitor, Charlie Dovecote. It cost me \u00a350, plus VAT, to be told by Dovecote that allowing a nonagenarian to ride a donkey in a stiff east wind may have been foolhardy, but did not constitute murder. I found a bundle of old letters under Mrs Wormington's mattress when I stripped her bed. I was glad that the horrible Eunice had missed them. October 21, 1917 Dear Sergeant Palmer, I hope you are now settled into your new quarters in Ypres and that the weather is pleasant. We hear most marvellous reports of General Haig's leadership from the newspapers. I am glad that you are in such safe hands. Thank you for asking me to call you Cedric. However, I feel it is far too early in our friendship for such intimacy. We have only known each other for a year. Yours with best wishes, Miss Broadway This, I presume, was Mrs Wormington's maiden name. Social intercourse was conducted with such delicacy in those days. It's no wonder that Mrs Wormington was shocked at Denise Van Outen's grubby little TV show. Even I, an admirer of the female breast, begin to tire of prime-time mammaries. Thursday, July 20 William wanted to know where Mrs Wormington had gone. I said she had gone on a long journey to a place where she would be in peace. I went on a bit, about Mrs Wormington running up hills and picking wild flowers under the warming rays of the sun, etc. Perhaps I went too far down the pastoral path, because when William was watching Glenn clean his roller-blade boots I heard him say, \"Mrs Wormington's not dead, Glenn. She's gone to live in Teletubby Land.\" Friday, July 21 A car in which Jack Straw was being conveyed was stopped by police for speeding at 103mph. I hope the full might of the law is brought to bear on the miscreant. I am still smarting from the tirade of abuse I received from a traffic policeman because I drove at 32mph in Foxglove Avenue, a 30mph zone. When I remarked, humorously, \"I'm not exactly Jeremy Clarkson\", the policeman sneered, \"No, he's taller, got more hair, and is almost certainly richer and more famous than you are, sir.\" I thought of reporting him to the Police Complaints Board, but wasn't sure if sarcasm counted as assault - though I still feel hurt by it. Saturday, July 22 I went to see Pandora at the MP's surgery today. I wanted to talk to her about my theory that Mr Blair has secretly embarked on a course of hormones that will transform him from Tony to Toni. I reminded her that he'd recently stated that he disliked wearing a suit. \"Don't be so bloody ridiculous,\" she snapped. \"Get out and give your seat to a constituent with a genuine problem.\" I pointed out that there was nobody else waiting to see her. \"Apathetic bastards,\" she raged of the electorate. \"I could have stayed in London and picked up my bowling bag from Prada.\" I had no idea she'd taken up such a middle-aged, boring sport.",

      "body": "<b>Dear Nigel,</b> <br> Last year, the running costs of the British security services, together with that of GCHQ, rose by 17% to \u00a31bn. These costs can be expected to rise further in the coming years. The services would be cheap at the price if they really were accountable and their activities confined to protecting the population from foreign subversion and terrorism. But we know that this has not been the case. Prior to 1989 neither service had any standing in law and there is compelling evidence that both engaged in unlawful activities, from MI6's collaboration with the CIA in 1953 in the coup against Mossadeq in Iran, to the MI5 plot against Harold Wilson in the 1970s and its targeting of trade unions, civil liberties groups and peace organisations. Has this changed? Two acts of parliament have established a degree of parliamentary and ministerial supervision of the services. But the amended Official Secrets Act (OSA) of 1989 imposed on their members a lifetime obligation of confidentiality, and the Shayler case shows the lengths to which the authorities are prepared to go to prevent the publication of evidence of criminal abuses. At present, then, the problem with the security services is not so much their cost as the threat they pose to individual and collective freedom. <p>Yours sincerely, <br>Michael Randle, <br> Lecturer in peace studies, <br> University of Bradford</p> <p><b>Dear Michael,</b><br> Whether MI5 [the domestic branch of the intelligence services] and SIS [the international branch, also known as MI6] are worth \u00a31bn a year is moot, but to propose that greater accountability will ensure value for money is a non-sequitur. Both have always been accountable to ministers, and now MI5 is accountable to an independent tribunal, a commissioner, a staff counsellor, an interception of communications commissioner and a parliamentary committee. As for the past, there is no evidence that MI5 abused its powers, and its surveillance of organisations penetrated by Soviet-funded communists merely monitored hostile foreign intelligence activity, but took no direct steps to disrupt it. To use the coup against Mossadeq as an example of SIS misconduct is absurd. Blame the politicians who ordered the operation, but it was not illegal for SIS to undertake it. Furthermore, it was in Britain's interests. What about SIS's telephone tapping in Athens that enabled weapons destined for EOKA terrorists to be intercepted? It was illegal under Greek law, but the operation saved British lives. It would be absurd to allow disaffected MI5 employees the freedom to betray the confidences of people who have volunteered information to the security service. If a genuine whistleblower has a grievance, there are plenty of safety valves available. </p> <p>Yours sincerely, <br> Nigel West, <br> Authority on national security </p> <p><b>Dear Nigel,</b><br> There is no non-sequitur. If the security services have been doing those things they ought not to have done, and leaving undone those things they ought to have done, openness and accountability serve to minimise the abuse of power and ensure better value for money. Clearly there is more accountability now than before 1989 when the services had no statutory existence. But the list of watchdogs you mention all have rubber teeth. The parliamentary intelligence and security committee is appointed by the prime minister, chaired by former defence minister Tom King, meets in secret, is bound by the OSA, and never makes any fundamental criticisms of the services. It refused to allow David Shayler to appear before it even when he had evidence that, at the very least, MI6 knew of the existence of a plot to kill or depose Colonel Gadafy. Its reports are vetted by the prime minister, and he and other ministers, or the head of an agency, can prevent the committee getting information they deem \"sensitive\". The tribunal is equally ineffective, and during its existence has not upheld a single complaint. Moreover, if a member of the services informs someone that they are being targeted, they render themselves liable to prosecution. Most crucial of all there is no public-interest defence in the 1989 OSA. So if a member of the services informs anyone, even their MP, of criminal activities by any of the services, they are liable to prosecution. You say there is no evidence that MI5 abused its powers. But first, it had no legal powers other than those enjoyed by any private body. Second, it was a ruling by the European commission on human rights that MI5 surveillance of Harriet Harman and Patricia Hewitt was in breach of the European Convention that forced the government to introduce the Security Service Act in 1989. As an advocate and occasional practitioner of civil disobedience, I agree that it can sometimes be right to break certain laws to prevent a greater evil. But criminal actions that breach the rights of people are another matter and cannot be justified in law or morality. You approve of the coup that overthrew the elected government of Mossadeq because it was \"in Britain's interest\". The claim is disputable, the act indefensible. About 100 people are estimated to have lost their lives in the coup, and Mossadeq's foreign minister was executed. The defence of \"only obeying orders\" should be ruled out once and for all.</p> <p>Yours sincerely, <br> Michael </p> <p><b>Dear Michael,</b><br> Tom King's committee is not the toothless pussycat you portray it to be. I can't see any of the ministers being cowed by the threat of an OSA prosecution if they seek to make a disclosure outside the protection of the Palace of Westminster. True, the committee declined to see Shayler, taking the view that he was a disgruntled ex-employee and not a whistle-blower, and that his complaints were best handled internally. His allegation regarding Gadafy is especially galling because, while he has asserted that SIS was in touch with a Libyan opposition group, he was wrong to say that SIS paid for, masterminded or even knew of an assassination. As you rightly say, the Harman/ Hewitt case proved the catalyst for the introduction of MI5's complaints tribunal and the commissioner, but you are mistaken if you interpret that event to mean that hitherto all the intercept warrants signed by many ministers of many different governments were illegal. SIS has always been an instrument of political power, collecting intelligence for ministers and undertaking clandestine operations on their authority. MI5 happily takes no such political direction but operates within the limits of the 1989 Act. To open either to public scrutiny would negate their effectiveness, place the public in danger and waste the taxpayer's money.</p> <p>Yours sincerely, <br> Nigel </p> <p><b>Dear Nigel,</b><br> Your letter confirms the fact that control exercised by the parliamentary intelligence and security committee is weak. You are confident that their members would be prepared to risk prosecution under the OSA if they felt it necessary to make disclosures outside the protection of the Palace of Westminster, but the question is whether they should have to act within that kind of restraint. Regarding Gadafy, the MI6 report posted on the internet shows that an MI6 officer was informed in advance of the plot to kill the Libyan leader in 1996 and that this report was circulated round Whitehall. According to Shayler, the informant was paid \u00a3100,000. As Lord Justice Judge said last Friday when he found in favour of the Guardian and Observer: \"If true, it was difficult to overestimate its enormity. If false, the allegations were inevitably damaging. Yet their refutation was also a matter of public importance.\" Yet the committee was not even prepared to hear what Shayler had to say. This was an acid test of its independence and competence - one that it failed. The problem with the tribunal is that it was set up to hear complaints from individuals who believe their privacy has been abused by the services. Since such individuals have no means of knowing whether or not they are being targeted, this safeguard is illusory. Whether or not the operations against Harman and Hewitt - and other innocent people - were strictly illegal is beside the point. They represented a gross abuse of executive power, as the European Commission judgment implies. Regarding SIS, you state that it has always been an instrument of political power, collecting secret intelligence for ministers and undertaking clandestine operations on their authority, and you accept that it was involved in the overthrow of a democratically elected government in Iran in 1953. No further comment is needed. The proposed new anti-terrorist legislation defines terrorism so broadly that MI5 will be able to target a still wider range of activists. This is the context in which its operations, and the lack of accountability, needs to be viewed. </p> <p>Yours sincerely, <br> Michael </p> <p><b>Dear Michael, </b> <br>Actually Tom King's committee has taken evidence very widely, and not just in the UK. Nevertheless, I concur that it is a less than perfect watchdog unless it has an experienced staff. However, the proposition that because there is room to improve current systems of parliamentary oversight we should scrap the country's security and intelligence agencies is plain daft. There is a vast difference between ministers being advised of anti-Gadafy plotters and SIS paying for his assassination. The security service does not randomly target or disadvantage innocent people, and undercover police enquiries do not conclude with the suspects being invited to review the evidence accumulated. The coup in Iran had full cabinet approval, and although you may not like either that, the Suez operation or a dozen other manifestations of past policy, SIS never acted independently. Criticise the politicians, but not the services that do their legal bidding.</p> <p>Nigel</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.mi5.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new&quot;\">MI5</a></p>",

If I fail, my pet will be taken away and kept in a cage for the rest of its life.</p> <p>As you may sense, this is only partly a story about animals. It is mostly about how I brought a dog to Berlin and ended up meeting Franz Kafka.</p> <p>Last month, an appalling incident took place. Two dogs kept for fighting escaped into a school playground in Hamburg and attacked and killed a six-year-old child.</p> <p>It was the almost inevitable outcome of a situation to which most German politicians had been turning a blind eye for years. As I remarked in an earlier edition of this column, as a newcomer to Berlin I found the number of pit bull terriers roaming off the lead here one of the more alarming aspects of life in the city.</p> <p>But nothing had prepared me for the speed at which things swung from one extreme to the other, or how quickly the authorities put together a towering paper edifice of regulation.</p> <p>Within six days of the tragedy, and with no evidence of consultation, the regional administration for Berlin had tacked up a decree proclaiming 12 breeds of dog to be inherently dangerous. They included such questionable choices as the Pyrenean mountain dog.</p> <p>The rearing of dogs from these breeds is now banned in Berlin, and those already here - some 20,000, according to police estimates - must be kept on a lead, except in special dog running zones, and muzzled even in the designated areas.</p> <p>What is more, they are to be confiscated and put in the equivalent of Battersea dogs' home if their owners are unable to produce a certificate, the Berlin dog licence known for short as the Amtliche Bescheinigung .</p> <p>We have just eight weeks in which to get hold of one, and to secure an Amtliche Bescheinigung we need to assemble six other pieces of paper.</p> <p>My quest began at the borough veterinary office where two officials registered our harmless Staffordshire bull terrier and noted down her precise date of birth - 23.01.93 - before granting her a temporary certificate and photographing her for an album of known suspects. Since the dogs in the album are wearing muzzles, they all look alike.</p> <p>Next stop was the local police station to get another certificate to say that I had no previous convictions. After that, a phone call to make an appointment to visit an officially approved examination centre to pick up the forms to apply for my test and for the two tests - for aggression and harmlessness - which Lola must take.</p> <p>I am looking at one of these forms as I write. One of the questions relates to \"known vices\". I presume this applies to Lola.</p> <p>But before we take our tests I have to get insurance for Lola in case she takes a strong dislike to the examiner. Since most insurance companies have decided not to cover any of the banned breeds, this is not as easy as it sounds. To make things worse, the veterinary office orchestrating this whole extraordinary paper chase refuses to divulge the names of firms which can help us.</p> <p>If we get through all three tests, our prize is the certificate and a medallion for Lola's collar which will be \"green, circular and with a diameter of 4cm\". At which point, she will be allowed out - still on a lead, but freed from the muzzle. Or so you might think.</p> <p>Remember I met Kafka - or should it be Joseph Heller? Despite everything done to ensure that the dog - and I - are harmless, Lola will continue to be imprisoned in a face mask which ensures that she can no longer be properly exercised: try throwing a ball for a dog which cannot pick it up.</p> <p>The woman at the examination centre said several owners had already reported that their previously docile pets had shown signs of aggression since the new regulations were introduced.</p>",

      "bodyText": "With which organ does a dog sense its surroundings? a: nose; b: eyes; c: touch. That, according to the newspaper Berliner Zeitung, is one of 30 questions I shall face in a multiple choice test set by the Berlin authorities to determine whether I am fit to own my pet. If I fail, my pet will be taken away and kept in a cage for the rest of its life. As you may sense, this is only partly a story about animals. It is mostly about how I brought a dog to Berlin and ended up meeting Franz Kafka. Last month, an appalling incident took place. Two dogs kept for fighting escaped into a school playground in Hamburg and attacked and killed a six-year-old child. It was the almost inevitable outcome of a situation to which most German politicians had been turning a blind eye for years. As I remarked in an earlier edition of this column, as a newcomer to Berlin I found the number of pit bull terriers roaming off the lead here one of the more alarming aspects of life in the city. But nothing had prepared me for the speed at which things swung from one extreme to the other, or how quickly the authorities put together a towering paper edifice of regulation. Within six days of the tragedy, and with no evidence of consultation, the regional administration for Berlin had tacked up a decree proclaiming 12 breeds of dog to be inherently dangerous. They included such questionable choices as the Pyrenean mountain dog. The rearing of dogs from these breeds is now banned in Berlin, and those already here - some 20,000, according to police estimates - must be kept on a lead, except in special dog running zones, and muzzled even in the designated areas. What is more, they are to be confiscated and put in the equivalent of Battersea dogs' home if their owners are unable to produce a certificate, the Berlin dog licence known for short as the Amtliche Bescheinigung . We have just eight weeks in which to get hold of one, and to secure an Amtliche Bescheinigung we need to assemble six other pieces of paper. My quest began at the borough veterinary office where two officials registered our harmless Staffordshire bull terrier and noted down her precise date of birth - 23.01.93 - before granting her a temporary certificate and photographing her for an album of known suspects. Since the dogs in the album are wearing muzzles, they all look alike. Next stop was the local police station to get another certificate to say that I had no previous convictions. After that, a phone call to make an appointment to visit an officially approved examination centre to pick up the forms to apply for my test and for the two tests - for aggression and harmlessness - which Lola must take. I am looking at one of these forms as I write. One of the questions relates to \"known vices\". I presume this applies to Lola. But before we take our tests I have to get insurance for Lola in case she takes a strong dislike to the examiner. Since most insurance companies have decided not to cover any of the banned breeds, this is not as easy as it sounds. To make things worse, the veterinary office orchestrating this whole extraordinary paper chase refuses to divulge the names of firms which can help us. If we get through all three tests, our prize is the certificate and a medallion for Lola's collar which will be \"green, circular and with a diameter of 4cm\". At which point, she will be allowed out - still on a lead, but freed from the muzzle. Or so you might think. Remember I met Kafka - or should it be Joseph Heller? Despite everything done to ensure that the dog - and I - are harmless, Lola will continue to be imprisoned in a face mask which ensures that she can no longer be properly exercised: try throwing a ball for a dog which cannot pick it up. The woman at the examination centre said several owners had already reported that their previously docile pets had shown signs of aggression since the new regulations were introduced.",

Instead, there is a deceptive, artless directness. </p> <p>The fair Melisande ate scallops on a bed of cabbage and pork belly with a warm balsamic dressing, and then roasted rabbit in a lavender sauce with carrots and saut\u00e9ed new potatoes.

If, for instance, we are growing a plant in rather heavy shade, gloss on the leaf will reflect any light that's around, and we shall appreciate its brightening of the gloom. </p> <p> Asarum europeum is a favourite of mine in this respect. It is a low-growing perennial, making clumps of dark green, orbicular leaves that are highly reflective. I particularly noticed this property when I saw it in the wild, in the Carpathians, where it made clumps (which I prefer to a uniform ground-covering carpet) beneath a canopy of mixed woodland. Being deciduous, the foliage is entirely fresh each spring and advantage can be taken of its winter dormancy by allowing aconites to thrive among a colony. </p> <p>The evergreen Daphne laureola (whose attractive name gave its title to a play in which Edith Evans starred) is equally at home in the shade of trees, and this again has glossy leaves. It makes a fair-sized shrub in time, of moderately sprawling habit 1.5m high, and it has rather insignificant green flowers in spring. However, it is worth picking some flowering branches for the house, as they are heavily fragrant at night. </p> <p>A sub-species of this daphne is called philippi , and this is almost ground-hugging.

This, again, is quite low-growing and suckering. It likes leafy woodland soil. Mine doesn't seem to be that sort of garden.

The leaves have become too large and coarse (keeping pace with the flowers). I should prefer them to be less obtrusive. An exception is a Camellia japonica cultivar called 'Lady Vansittart'. This has abundant, neat, pointed foliage with a twist on the leaves. The flowers take you by surprise by varying their colouring, sometimes white, sometimes pale pink, sometimes red, or partially red. They die brown on the shrub, as with so many camellias. Still, I grow it. </p> <p>Glossy leaves are best appreciated on shade-loving plants. Another such is the rather tender Farfugium japonicum (0.3m), with large and substantial orbicular leaves. In Japan, it flowers handsomely with rich yellow daisies in October, but in our climate it does not reach that stage. Still, it is a splendid foliage plant and I have a very soft spot for the hecticly yellow-spotted cultivar, 'Aureomaculatum'. The white-variegated 'Argenteum' is also offered and is a good plant, though leaf gloss is less evident in this case. </p> <p>Hart's-tongue ferns, Asplenium scolopendrium, have an excellent shiny front surface, the texture and shaping of which varies considerably among the many cultivars. These fronds are more or less evergreen, but the old crop is best removed in early spring, so as not to interfere with its pristine new sheaves. </p> <p>The cherry laurel, Prunus laurocerasus, is apt to be demeaned simply because it is both vigorous and undemanding, flourishing in sunlight and shade. If not heavily pruned, it can make a delightful display in spring, with candles of white blossom. Here, again, there are many cultivars. If you have the space, I can recommend the large-leaved 'Latifolia' (also known as 'Magnoliifolia'), which is handsome at all times of the year.

Its dark, lustrous green contrasts well with a golden conifer-like Thuja occidentalis 'Rheingold'. </p> <p>I usually prune my 'Otto Luyken' a little after its spring flowering, removing the weakened shoots that flowered most. A heavier pruning, to prevent the shrub becoming over-bulky, is done perhaps once in eight years. In some years, there is an autumn crop of its white blossom. </p> <p> Eucalyptus niphophila is a very different animal from any so far mentioned. A usually rather slender tree with a pale trunk, its pendant scimitar leaves catch sunlight, especially from a low sun, and perform a winking act that seems to make them dance.

Sir Paul, a longtime supporter of the gallery, was \"the perfect partner\" for the project, because, said Mr Whitmore, his designs were \"traditional yet witty\". Sir Paul joins a long line of catwalk designers who have turned their hand to the less glamorous world of uniforms. Paul Costelloe recently designed new uniforms, including orange fleeces and baseball caps, for the shop floor staff of Sainsbury's. Earlier this year, Barclays Bank paid \u00a33m for a new staff uniform designed by Jeff Banks.",

Earlier the Coventry manager, Gordon Strachan, had insisted he would do all he could to keep hold of the Republic of Ireland international, who scored 12 goals last season despite missing much of it with a knee injury.

His status as a hero to the Real fans - after two Spanish league and two Champions League triumphs during his six years at the club - has quickly disappeared and has had to suffer public vilification during the last 24 hours. A Real Madrid source leaked a copy of the transfer contract to the Spanish sports daily Marca, which published it on its front page yesterday. \"Redondo signed first.

      "body": "<p>July 2000, a month I have been building up to for a very long time. In fact, I have been waiting 18 years since my Dad told me at the age of 17 to invest in a pension that I would not receive until the next century. I immediately started putting aside the princely sum of \u00a310 a month and have been waiting ever since. </p> <p>Now that time has arrived a thought has occurred to me. How many of today's Premiership players will need a pension when they reach the age of 35? The answer, probably, is none because football has changed so remarkably since 1982. But has it changed for the better? I don't think so. </p> <p>Who would have believed back then that on my pension date half the Premiership - or First Division as it was in those days - would be made up of foreigners? </p> <p>I am not anti-foreign and the likes of Cantona, Zola, Gullit, Bergkamp, Schmeichel and Ginola have been good for our game and have helped the Premiership to become one of the most exciting leagues in the world. They have in many aspects helped the development and attitudes of British players and I can say through experience that it's a much harder league to play in now than 10 or even five years ago. </p> <p>But I do think the time has come for us and all the other European countries to bring in rules restricting the number of foreign players. There have been many overrated and overpaid foreigners who have come to England and not been as good as the British players they have replaced. They have earned thousands of pounds without deserving it. </p> <p>Lennart Johansson, president of Uefa, said recently that we have too many foreign players and he is right, because people don't realise the domino effect that they cause. Every not-so-good one forces a Premiership player into the First Division, and then more Englishmen into the Second and Third. In the end you may have around 300 professional-quality players with no club to play for. </p> <p>I would like a ruling where 10 of a chosen squad must be British, and the other six from anywhere else. This will encourage clubs to develop home-grown talent mixed with only the cream from abroad. A club can have 15 foreigners if they like but on match days only six should be chosen. </p> <p>I think the number of foreign imports would soon drop if they weren't more or less assured of first-team football. </p> <p>Clubs need to take more responsibility as well. Appointing foreign managers is a guarantee that loads of foreign players will be coming in, as managers quite understandably like to have players they can converse with in their mother tongue. As good as the coach may be, it is not always a good thing for English football. </p> <p>Clubs are too easily being persuaded to try the quick fix nowadays by splashing millions on foreigners instead of investing in the future. Arsenal have just bought two more foreigners yet their youth team have just won the FA Youth Cup. One of the cup-final goalscorers, Jay Bothroyd, has already been sold to Coventry. </p> <p>Surely there must be a Tony Adams or Paul Merson waiting to come through? I just wonder if we will ever get the chance to see them. </p> <p>Chelsea announced at the start of the summer that they would buy British, and have since bought three foreigners, reducing the chances of the Brits next season. Though, to be fair to both clubs, had they inquired about a British player - say in the First Division - they may have been quoted an exhorbitant figure, say \u00a35m, for someone who has yet to appear at the highest level. </p> <p>That can't be right. Transfer fees and the whole foreign problem have to be looked at so we can protect and improve the future of our game. </p> <p>Our Euro 2000 performance doesn't bode well for the future but I believe we have an exciting crop of youngsters coming through who could be on top of the world in 2006. The next World Cup will come too quickly for them, and Euro 2004 should be used as a launch pad for the German World Cup. But if we can play as a team rather than as 11 talented individuals we might just have a chance with the likes of Beckham, Scholes, Cole and Ferdinand in our side. </p> <p>Perhaps by then the government will have realised the shameful scenes in Charleroi and Brussels were not caused by true football fans but by thugs looking for the nearest punch-up. We don't get trouble inside grounds any more but the hooligans are still there and they certainly did everything possible to wreck our World Cup bid. </p> <p>The government needs to act and perhaps now, in Adam Crozier, the Football Association's chief executive, we've at least got someone in the FA under the age of 70 who is willing to take some hard decisions. </p> <p>We need to restructure our youth football before it is too late. The government keeps building houses on the playing fields and the kids now seem more interested in Gameboys than kicking a football around. </p> <p>We need to get back to basics and teach kids of eight and nine to pass, control and shoot properly rather than to win every game and kick the ball as far as possible. </p> <p>Better coaching and less of the \"win at all costs\" mentality has to be good for football.

      "bodyText": "July 2000, a month I have been building up to for a very long time. In fact, I have been waiting 18 years since my Dad told me at the age of 17 to invest in a pension that I would not receive until the next century. I immediately started putting aside the princely sum of \u00a310 a month and have been waiting ever since. Now that time has arrived a thought has occurred to me. How many of today's Premiership players will need a pension when they reach the age of 35? The answer, probably, is none because football has changed so remarkably since 1982. But has it changed for the better? I don't think so. Who would have believed back then that on my pension date half the Premiership - or First Division as it was in those days - would be made up of foreigners? I am not anti-foreign and the likes of Cantona, Zola, Gullit, Bergkamp, Schmeichel and Ginola have been good for our game and have helped the Premiership to become one of the most exciting leagues in the world. They have in many aspects helped the development and attitudes of British players and I can say through experience that it's a much harder league to play in now than 10 or even five years ago. But I do think the time has come for us and all the other European countries to bring in rules restricting the number of foreign players. There have been many overrated and overpaid foreigners who have come to England and not been as good as the British players they have replaced. They have earned thousands of pounds without deserving it. Lennart Johansson, president of Uefa, said recently that we have too many foreign players and he is right, because people don't realise the domino effect that they cause. Every not-so-good one forces a Premiership player into the First Division, and then more Englishmen into the Second and Third. In the end you may have around 300 professional-quality players with no club to play for. I would like a ruling where 10 of a chosen squad must be British, and the other six from anywhere else. This will encourage clubs to develop home-grown talent mixed with only the cream from abroad. A club can have 15 foreigners if they like but on match days only six should be chosen. I think the number of foreign imports would soon drop if they weren't more or less assured of first-team football. Clubs need to take more responsibility as well. Appointing foreign managers is a guarantee that loads of foreign players will be coming in, as managers quite understandably like to have players they can converse with in their mother tongue. As good as the coach may be, it is not always a good thing for English football. Clubs are too easily being persuaded to try the quick fix nowadays by splashing millions on foreigners instead of investing in the future. Arsenal have just bought two more foreigners yet their youth team have just won the FA Youth Cup. One of the cup-final goalscorers, Jay Bothroyd, has already been sold to Coventry. Surely there must be a Tony Adams or Paul Merson waiting to come through? I just wonder if we will ever get the chance to see them. Chelsea announced at the start of the summer that they would buy British, and have since bought three foreigners, reducing the chances of the Brits next season. Though, to be fair to both clubs, had they inquired about a British player - say in the First Division - they may have been quoted an exhorbitant figure, say \u00a35m, for someone who has yet to appear at the highest level. That can't be right. Transfer fees and the whole foreign problem have to be looked at so we can protect and improve the future of our game. Our Euro 2000 performance doesn't bode well for the future but I believe we have an exciting crop of youngsters coming through who could be on top of the world in 2006. The next World Cup will come too quickly for them, and Euro 2004 should be used as a launch pad for the German World Cup. But if we can play as a team rather than as 11 talented individuals we might just have a chance with the likes of Beckham, Scholes, Cole and Ferdinand in our side. Perhaps by then the government will have realised the shameful scenes in Charleroi and Brussels were not caused by true football fans but by thugs looking for the nearest punch-up. We don't get trouble inside grounds any more but the hooligans are still there and they certainly did everything possible to wreck our World Cup bid. The government needs to act and perhaps now, in Adam Crozier, the Football Association's chief executive, we've at least got someone in the FA under the age of 70 who is willing to take some hard decisions. We need to restructure our youth football before it is too late. The government keeps building houses on the playing fields and the kids now seem more interested in Gameboys than kicking a football around. We need to get back to basics and teach kids of eight and nine to pass, control and shoot properly rather than to win every game and kick the ball as far as possible. Better coaching and less of the \"win at all costs\" mentality has to be good for football. Parents should stop shouting and hollering, and encourage their children to play the game properly and practise their skills. Perhaps then we might find among our population of 50 million someone who can play for England and actually kick the ball with his left foot. Another thing we need to look at is the wage spiral which is getting worse and worse. It is only a question of time before a player is earning \u00a3100,000 a week - in some countries they already do - and clubs will go to the wall if they continue to pay players a weekly wage of even \u00a320,000 - the exact sum it took me a year to earn in 1983. Paying young players these vast amounts of money is not a good idea because being a millionaire by the age of 20 is not likely to keep you motivated for another 10 years or so. Players will very soon start retiring at 27 or 28 with a swollen bank balance but fed up of the hassle and aggravation that comes with being a professional footballer, and with no desire to play any more. The only connection between the points I've raised is the word \"money\" - the love of which is frequently seen as the root of all evil. I wouldn't go that far but it's fair to say that in 1983 football was a sport, now it's just a massive business empire. I really do fear for the future and if I sound like a moaning old professional it's only because I care. Still, I've had my time in the game and I wouldn't change a minute. I would just like to see the powers that be do what's right for the game and its future and sacrifice short-term gain for long-term planning. I will take my pension and enjoy it, happy that we are not hosting the World Cup in 2006. My two-year-old twin boys will be 28 and in their prime when England hopefully hold the tournament in 2026 and I might see them help recapture the cup 60 years after the last time.

Wenger is now under intense pressure to bolster his increasingly fragile-looking squad although money should be no object in his pursuit for new players, especially as a good percentage of Nicolas Anelka's \u00a323m sale to Real Madrid remains untouched. The Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein confirmed last night that Barca's \u00a332m cheque had gone straight into the club's transfer budget and Wenger will have carte blanche to sign some of the world's leading players. His first task will be lodging an improved offer for Wiltord after balking at Bordeaux's \u00a315m asking price for the player who scored France's injury-time equaliser against Italy in the Euro 2000 final. However, Dein also confirmed that the club had not, contrary to reports, abandoned all hope of sorting out Edu's passport problems and resurrecting a \u00a36m deal for the Corinthians midfielder that most observers believed had been brought to its knees. \"We are still actively trying to get Edu as well as a couple of others,\" said Dein. \"The fans simply have to trust Ars\u00e8ne's judgment - and I don't believe anyone could have any questions about it since he joined the club. \"Admittedly the timing of this deal perhaps does not work in our favour but it's all about whether players are available at a given time.\" Although it will be of little consolation to Arsenal's fans, the departure of Overmars and Petit represents a massive financial success for the club. Overmars cost \u00a35.5m from Ajax three years ago and Arsenal recruited the versatile Gilles Grimandi as part of the deal when Petit arrived from Monaco in a \u00a33.5m deal. Both played a pivotal part in the club's 1998 double but Overmars suffered from a loss of form and recurrent ankle injuries last season while Petit repeatedly threatened to quit the English game because of his disciplinary problems during a disappointing campaign for the club. When Barcelona contacted the players' advisers at the start of summer they immediately let it be known they would relish the move and, no matter how reluctant Wenger was to accept the inevitable, he was realistic enough to accept there was no way financially that Arsenal could compete. Although Arsenal rarely reveal the prices they pay, their 25 signings under Wenger are believed to have been made for a total of around \u00a358m, while more than 30 players have been shipped out for a combined income of approximately \u00a377m. But the problem Wenger is likely to encounter is coming across any club willing to part with key players so close to the new season. The left-sided Pires may be seen as a ready-made replacement for Overmars but he did not play as an out-and-out winger for Marseille, while much will depend on how quickly Lauren, a \u00a37m arrival from Real Mallorca, acclimatises to the English game. Wenger will renew his acquaintance with Overmars and Petit when Arsenal meet Barcelona in a pre-season tournament hosted by Ajax next week. The Dutch international winger Boudewijn Zenden's \u00a37.6m transfer from Barcelona to Lazio has fallen through.",

It was there that Mick McCarthy, their centre-back, once managed to score at both ends. It was there, too, in Liam Brady's first match in charge, that his team managed to score three goals while conceding four. The black crepe around the Tannadice memories for Celtic fans is that at least twice in the 90s, Rangers have clinched the championship title in that same stadium. </p> <p>After his first game Brady appeared frazzled and left Glasgow two years later like a wounded animal.

The overflowing of the hot-blooded passion and faith of Celtic's fans has been questioned down the years but their willingness to take emotional punishment and still come back for more is beyond doubt. </p> <p>Parkhead has 60,000 seats and most Saturdays they are filled. There is talk of an extension to 70,000 in the near future and this is not an over-reaching ambition. The man who sets Celtic alight, and navigates them successfully in Europe, will be laughing all the way to the bank. </p> <p>O'Neill, though, has inherited a squad with glaring weaknesses. If some of his players are not well endowed technically, others seem to have been in psychological disarray. Eyal Berkovic, for one, did not play for a quarter of last season because, it was claimed, his mind was not right. Olivier Tebily, a defender from the Ivory Coast, was claimed to have been held hostage for two days during a trip home. Bought by John Barnes, he is one of the doziest defenders ever seen in the Scottish game, which has had more than its fair share of somnambulists. </p> <p>With the Brazilian defender Rafael Schiedt included in his catalogue of woes, O'Neill must have an even greater sense of Rangers' superiority. Like Tebily, he was signed by Barnes, and at the insistence of the club Schiedt is commonly referred to by his christian name for obvious reasons. </p> <p>O'Neill at least seems to be a realist. He has some gouging and surgery to perform quite unlike any he has experienced at Wycombe or Leicester. </p> <p>\"In terms of the number of players at their disposal and their quality, Dick Advocaat and Rangers are far ahead of us,\" said O'Neill. \"If I can, though, I'd like at least to get off to the best possible start to keep up the pressure on our rivals. In our pre-season games we've shown great determination, which has been a bonus. The players are at least trying to come round to my philosophy.\" </p> <p>Pre-season, though, has not boded well for Celtic. A tour took them to Ireland, Scandinavia and, unfathomably for one day, to Germany. On their travels Celtic's world famous green and white hoops were stopped in their tracks by various teams of little renown. Back in Glasgow last weekend they took a hammering from a Bordeaux side that admittedly was highly talented, before regrouping in time to beat West Ham on Tuesday. </p> <p>Perhaps none of this matters a great deal. By definition, pre-season is about conditioning and not conclusions. The hunch already, though, is that Celtic are on the threshold of another nerve-shredding campaign. </p> <p>As if these omens were not enough, the \u00a36m Chris Sutton has arrived from Chelsea. While Advocaat has bought seven new players, Sutton and the Belgium centre-back Joos Valgaeren are O'Neill's only summer signings. Yesterday Celtic completed the \u00a33.8m deal for Valgaeren from Roda JC Kerkrade, though for an anaemic team it all seems an insufficient transfusion of new blood. </p> <p>Sutton, inured surely to his own unflattering headlines at Chelsea, still popped up like a rabbit in headlights when he was ambushed by the media on his first day in Glasgow. This is another aspect to which even established names from England like O'Neill and Sutton must adapt. As Walter Smith has admitted since moving from Ibrox to Everton, the gang of pressmen who are interested in all things Rangers and Celtic is like no other in British football. It is this pressure from the media, and how O'Neill handles it, which will be a determining feature of his success or failure in Scotland. </p> <p>For two years , though, there has been one shining light at Parkhead, and O'Neill can at least be grateful that it is back on full beam. Henrik Larsson is this team's heart and soul, the imaginative catalyst forever dragging Celtic out of a hole. After 10 months out with a broken leg, the Swede appears back to his ferreting, mischievous best. \"You can see just by looking at him what a special talent he is,\" says O'Neill. \"I'd heard a lot about Henrik in England but it is still wonderful to work with his talent and attitude.\" </p> <p>The green half of Glasgow awaits to see if Larsson and Sutton can work in harness. An emotional football city is also braced to judge whether a charming Irishman can restore Celtic once the blarney has ceased.</p>",

Olivier Tebily, a defender from the Ivory Coast, was claimed to have been held hostage for two days during a trip home. Bought by John Barnes, he is one of the doziest defenders ever seen in the Scottish game, which has had more than its fair share of somnambulists. With the Brazilian defender Rafael Schiedt included in his catalogue of woes, O'Neill must have an even greater sense of Rangers' superiority. Like Tebily, he was signed by Barnes, and at the insistence of the club Schiedt is commonly referred to by his christian name for obvious reasons. O'Neill at least seems to be a realist. He has some gouging and surgery to perform quite unlike any he has experienced at Wycombe or Leicester. \"In terms of the number of players at their disposal and their quality, Dick Advocaat and Rangers are far ahead of us,\" said O'Neill. \"If I can, though, I'd like at least to get off to the best possible start to keep up the pressure on our rivals. In our pre-season games we've shown great determination, which has been a bonus. The players are at least trying to come round to my philosophy.\" Pre-season, though, has not boded well for Celtic. A tour took them to Ireland, Scandinavia and, unfathomably for one day, to Germany. On their travels Celtic's world famous green and white hoops were stopped in their tracks by various teams of little renown. Back in Glasgow last weekend they took a hammering from a Bordeaux side that admittedly was highly talented, before regrouping in time to beat West Ham on Tuesday. Perhaps none of this matters a great deal. By definition, pre-season is about conditioning and not conclusions. The hunch already, though, is that Celtic are on the threshold of another nerve-shredding campaign. As if these omens were not enough, the \u00a36m Chris Sutton has arrived from Chelsea. While Advocaat has bought seven new players, Sutton and the Belgium centre-back Joos Valgaeren are O'Neill's only summer signings. Yesterday Celtic completed the \u00a33.8m deal for Valgaeren from Roda JC Kerkrade, though for an anaemic team it all seems an insufficient transfusion of new blood. Sutton, inured surely to his own unflattering headlines at Chelsea, still popped up like a rabbit in headlights when he was ambushed by the media on his first day in Glasgow. This is another aspect to which even established names from England like O'Neill and Sutton must adapt. As Walter Smith has admitted since moving from Ibrox to Everton, the gang of pressmen who are interested in all things Rangers and Celtic is like no other in British football. It is this pressure from the media, and how O'Neill handles it, which will be a determining feature of his success or failure in Scotland. For two years , though, there has been one shining light at Parkhead, and O'Neill can at least be grateful that it is back on full beam. Henrik Larsson is this team's heart and soul, the imaginative catalyst forever dragging Celtic out of a hole. After 10 months out with a broken leg, the Swede appears back to his ferreting, mischievous best. \"You can see just by looking at him what a special talent he is,\" says O'Neill. \"I'd heard a lot about Henrik in England but it is still wonderful to work with his talent and attitude.\" The green half of Glasgow awaits to see if Larsson and Sutton can work in harness. An emotional football city is also braced to judge whether a charming Irishman can restore Celtic once the blarney has ceased.",

But the manager Ricky Skerritt said Lara was a definite starter for Old Trafford, where he hit 87 and 145 the last time West Indies visited these shores. \"We didn't want Brian to aggravate the injury,\" Skerritt explained. \"He was complaining of some tightness in his right hamstring.

Mohammad Azharuddin's nightmare week ended in further embarrassment yesterday when income tax officials seized \"incriminating documents\" from the house of his wife, the Bollywood actor Sangeeta Bijlani. Only days after Australian television claimed the former Indian captain had made $50m (\u00a333m) from fixing matches, officials raided the flat that Bijlani had apparently sold two years ago to a man called Suresh Jain. \"We were surprised that the flat still had her name written outside,\" a tax department spokesman said. \"Incriminating documents relating to property and income tax evasion were recovered.\" Detectives would no doubt love to be a fly on the wall at the Oval today when Azharuddin takes the field against the Rest of the World for an Asian XI managed by Kapil Dev and including Wasim Akram and Ajay Jadeja - all of whom have been linked with alleged corruption.

      "bodyText": "The Ministry of Defence has scrapped plans to develop a European anti-tank weapon after spending more than \u00a3100m on the project, it announced yesterday. Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, said Britain will abandon the production of the medium-range Trigat weapon which is already 10 years late. The decision was announced a day after Britain and seven other European countries pledged to strengthen cooperation on defence projects. The national audit office revealed earlier this month that Trigat had been delayed for so long that it would have been ineffective by the time it was brought into service. In a written Commons answer before the summer break, Mr Hoon said Britain had not been able to reach agreement with the other nations - France, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium - developing the weapon. The project began in the mid-1970s and the weapon was due to enter into service in 1996. The main British contractor to build the weapon was Matra BAe Dynamics. The MoD will now look for an \"off-the-shelf\" anti-tank weapon which could be carried by light infantry forces. It will also review the weapons needed by heavier mechanised units.

In an interview with the Guardian, Captain Amos Pampaloni, 89, a Florentine whose experiences almost exactly reflect those of the fictional Corelli, accuses the British author of rewriting the story of Cephalonia's war and \"pandering to racism\" by portraying Greek partisans as \"barbarians\". Mr Pampaloni's onslaught is likely to fuel controversy about de Berni\u00e8res's story on the island, where a US-backed film, starring Nicolas Cage as Captain Corelli, is being shot. Under a barrage of complaints from Cephalonian resistance veterans and politicians the film-makers have given undertakings that the movie will be a straightforward love story and will not repeat de Berni\u00e8res's most controversial claims. The author was persuaded to cut inflammatory passages from the Greek edition of his book, which has sold 1.5m copies worldwide, and recently conceded that he \"might be wrong\" about the communist-led Greek resistance. But the campaign in Cephalonia against the book appears to be growing, despite the boost to its tourist industry. Last week the Greek government was criticised for providing soldiers and ships for the film's battle scenes. The novel tells the story of a love affair between the daughter of a Cephalonian doctor and a captain in Mussolini's army of occupation, who helps turn Italian troops against the Germans and survives the subsequent massacre of more than 9,000 of them. Woven into the drama is an unremittingly hostile account of the role of the Greek resistance, who are portrayed as torturers, rapists and cowards who refuse to fight the Germans. In particular, de Berni\u00e8res claims the partisans refused to support the Italians in their confrontation with Hitler's troops in September 1943. Speaking for the first time about the book at his home in Florence, Mr Pampaloni said Cephalonian guerrillas did fight alongside the Italians. \"The picture painted of the Greek partisans is unacceptable,\" the Italian veteran said. \"To speak of the Greeks as barbarians, who killed for the sake of it, is pandering to racism.\" Like de Berni\u00e8res's hero, Mr Pampaloni was a captain in an artillery regiment on Cephalonia and like Corelli, he had an affair with a local girl.

      "byline": "James Davidson",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> The Invention Of Jane Harrison</strong> <br>Mary Beard <br>Harvard, \u00a323.50 <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502428725,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Someone was running across the gardens of \"Fernham College\" at a terrific pace. Her features were indistinct; the half-light made phantoms of everyone. But there was something familiar about her. \"Could it be J- H- herself?\"</p> <p>Jane Harrison, who had died a few months before, would have enjoyed her cameo role in Virginia Woolf's A Room of One's Own as a fleeting, unstoppable ghost. Born bang in the middle of the 19th century and passing into the Land of the Shades only in 1928, Harrison remains one of the most important and influential women in the field of classical studies.</p> <p>Almost a century after they were written, her books - Themis, Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion - are still in print. She is famous for being among the first to dig through the sublime surfaces of Greek civilisation to expose the stranger and more primitive culture lurking underneath. </p> <p>Prime ministers knew her, as did Eliots TS and George. Andr\u00e9 Gide wrote a poem, \"Persephone\", based on her ideas about the vegetation cycle, while Virginia Woolf was on hand to observe her \"billing and cooing\" with Hope Mirlees, the woman with whom she shared her later years and who became her devoted but reticent archivist.</p> <p>As well as being clever and important she was also, of course, a Character, full of self-belief. Indeed, she was several Characters, depending on the audience and the mood - a professionally bluff Yorkshirewoman when it suited her, at other times the chain-smoking Sappho of Colville Gardens, whose intimate seminars were the subject of an admiring article in the Pall Mall Gazette. </p> <p>Her lectures were full-scale theatrical events that she toured around the country. She dressed for the occasion, most famously in a shimmering beetle green, talking emphatically and always down to her audience, casting shadows over the hand-painted images of bearded serpents, sacrificial oxen and key words projected onto the screen behind her. There were sound effects, too. On one memorable occasion she had two friends whirl bull-roarers at the back of the hall to evoke the noises of a mystery cult. In Glasgow, 1,600 people came to hear her talk on Attic grave stelae, or so she told the reporter from the Gazette. To many she was a living monument, to others a brilliant self-publicist. </p> <p>With her Sapphic love, her fondness for William Morris wallpaper, her languor and quotability, her deployment of teddy bears - in one letter, Harrison's toy bear invites Hope Mirlees, \"his young wife\", to dine in Hall with Harrison, his \"elder wife\", and signs off with a picture of the constellation Ursa Major - Harrison fits perfectly into the history of the Decadents and Effeminates, a history in which women rarely find a place. In some ways she is what Oscar Wilde, four years younger and the most brilliant male classicist of his year, might have been had he succeeded in his ambition to become an Oxford don. </p> <p>Mary Beard has spent long hours in Jane Harrison's company, digging through the archives. She is interested less in Harrison's biography than in the way her students constructed her life and her archive. How to be honest and truthful about a woman they admired and loved without giving away her \"Secret\"? Harrison had herself published a book of reminiscences, but she destroyed much other material. Mirlees planned a personal biography shortly after Harrison's death, but found over several decades that it was an impossible task. It was Mirlees above all who made the archive, but the archive is designed to hide as much as it reveals. In Mary Beard, however, Jane Harrison has met her match.</p> <p>The star of The Invention of Jane Harrison has to share the limelight with another character who is much more obscure. Ten years younger than Harrison, Eugenie Sellers, known to posterity as Mrs Arthur Strong, seemed at one time an equally good bet for posthumous glory. A great beauty in the 19th century who modelled for the pre-Raphaelites, in the 20th she became a pioneering historian of Roman art.</p> <p>According to Asquith, she was the most \"distinguished woman scholar\" in the world: one of the first women to become a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, recipient of the CBE and the gold medal of the city of Rome. She dominated the British School of Art and Archaeology for years, although not in title Director, but his Assistant. </p> <p>When the director eventually married, troubles inevitably arose, ostensibly over fondness for animals. Was it true, as was alleged, that Mrs Strong had actually encouraged students to attend a bullfight? From such trivial beginnings a feud grew.

      "bodyText": "The Invention Of Jane Harrison Mary Beard Harvard, \u00a323.50 Buy it at BOL Someone was running across the gardens of \"Fernham College\" at a terrific pace. Her features were indistinct; the half-light made phantoms of everyone. But there was something familiar about her. \"Could it be J- H- herself?\" Jane Harrison, who had died a few months before, would have enjoyed her cameo role in Virginia Woolf's A Room of One's Own as a fleeting, unstoppable ghost. Born bang in the middle of the 19th century and passing into the Land of the Shades only in 1928, Harrison remains one of the most important and influential women in the field of classical studies. Almost a century after they were written, her books - Themis, Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion - are still in print. She is famous for being among the first to dig through the sublime surfaces of Greek civilisation to expose the stranger and more primitive culture lurking underneath. Prime ministers knew her, as did Eliots TS and George. Andr\u00e9 Gide wrote a poem, \"Persephone\", based on her ideas about the vegetation cycle, while Virginia Woolf was on hand to observe her \"billing and cooing\" with Hope Mirlees, the woman with whom she shared her later years and who became her devoted but reticent archivist. As well as being clever and important she was also, of course, a Character, full of self-belief. Indeed, she was several Characters, depending on the audience and the mood - a professionally bluff Yorkshirewoman when it suited her, at other times the chain-smoking Sappho of Colville Gardens, whose intimate seminars were the subject of an admiring article in the Pall Mall Gazette. Her lectures were full-scale theatrical events that she toured around the country. She dressed for the occasion, most famously in a shimmering beetle green, talking emphatically and always down to her audience, casting shadows over the hand-painted images of bearded serpents, sacrificial oxen and key words projected onto the screen behind her. There were sound effects, too. On one memorable occasion she had two friends whirl bull-roarers at the back of the hall to evoke the noises of a mystery cult. In Glasgow, 1,600 people came to hear her talk on Attic grave stelae, or so she told the reporter from the Gazette. To many she was a living monument, to others a brilliant self-publicist. With her Sapphic love, her fondness for William Morris wallpaper, her languor and quotability, her deployment of teddy bears - in one letter, Harrison's toy bear invites Hope Mirlees, \"his young wife\", to dine in Hall with Harrison, his \"elder wife\", and signs off with a picture of the constellation Ursa Major - Harrison fits perfectly into the history of the Decadents and Effeminates, a history in which women rarely find a place. In some ways she is what Oscar Wilde, four years younger and the most brilliant male classicist of his year, might have been had he succeeded in his ambition to become an Oxford don. Mary Beard has spent long hours in Jane Harrison's company, digging through the archives. She is interested less in Harrison's biography than in the way her students constructed her life and her archive. How to be honest and truthful about a woman they admired and loved without giving away her \"Secret\"? Harrison had herself published a book of reminiscences, but she destroyed much other material. Mirlees planned a personal biography shortly after Harrison's death, but found over several decades that it was an impossible task. It was Mirlees above all who made the archive, but the archive is designed to hide as much as it reveals. In Mary Beard, however, Jane Harrison has met her match. The star of The Invention of Jane Harrison has to share the limelight with another character who is much more obscure. Ten years younger than Harrison, Eugenie Sellers, known to posterity as Mrs Arthur Strong, seemed at one time an equally good bet for posthumous glory. A great beauty in the 19th century who modelled for the pre-Raphaelites, in the 20th she became a pioneering historian of Roman art. According to Asquith, she was the most \"distinguished woman scholar\" in the world: one of the first women to become a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, recipient of the CBE and the gold medal of the city of Rome. She dominated the British School of Art and Archaeology for years, although not in title Director, but his Assistant. When the director eventually married, troubles inevitably arose, ostensibly over fondness for animals. Was it true, as was alleged, that Mrs Strong had actually encouraged students to attend a bullfight? From such trivial beginnings a feud grew. When it seemed to be reaching a crisis, all three were summarily, if politely, dismissed. Eugenie stayed on in Rome and increased her renown and her collection of calling cards. Her friends and acquaintances included Henry James, Ezra Pound, Mussolini and a whole clutch of cardinals. We know this because she saved the calling cards, as well as the correspondence over the bullfight dispute, annotating her letters. She left two rich archives, one in Cambridge and the other in Rome at the British School. Jane Harrison, on the other hand, burned her letters. Nevertheless it is Harrison and not Strong who is remembered. Since they seem to have known almost everyone else worth knowing, Beard has a hunch that - despite the almost complete silence from their biographers - these two famous scholars must also have known each other. Mrs Strong, she notes, contributed to Harrison's memorial fund the carefully unobtrusive sum of one pound and five pence. Going much further back, she finds both as eager participants in a series of Greek tableaux put on in the spring of 1883 in the private theatre of Cromwell House, home of Sir Charles and Lady Freake, a couple not renowned for their refinements (Lady Freake, it was noted with some amusement, pronounced Homer without the aitch). These were glittering events. Sets and poses were arranged by the great painters of the time, Alma-Tadema, Lord Leighton, Millais and Burne-Jones. Gladstone and Tennyson were to be discovered in the audience. The beautiful Eugenie was often to be found playing Helen, of course, and the costumes, poses and ladies received extravagant praise. But, as Beard discovers, the connection between Eugenie and Jane went rather deeper than sharing the same stage. In fact, it seems likely that they shared a flat and feelings for each other. While Harrison worked up her lectures, Strong was busy booking venues and arranging publicity. At some point, however, there was a \"terrific bust-up\" and Harrison is later to be found angered by Strong and the \"unscrupulous way she used people to get on\", while in the drafts of her autobiography Strong refers darkly to the kind of woman who applied \"the power of fascination... where she could, on callow youths chiefly and younger women\". Beard is too careful a scholar to draw conclusions about the precise nature of the \"bust-up\", and too careful a historian to out Harrison and Strong anachronistically as a lesbian couple, but she makes a cogent case for rewriting the history of Classics in a way that would make Harrison less isolated, treating the two women as partners rather than ships that passed in the night. This book does not celebrate a rare and uncomplicated feminine triumph in the still-too-butch Academy, nor does it make easy connections between Harrison's Sapphic life and work, for all its bearded snakes, powerful goddesses and transient gods. What it does do is evoke wonderfully the kitschy Hellenic craze of the end of the 19th century, female friendship and rivalry and, above all, what it is like to be led by ghosts through an archive - careful ghosts with high expectations of the life you will produce, ghosts with a secret and endless ways to distract you from it with calling cards, precisely measured donations, wrongly labelled photographs and endless other false trails.",

My favourite Lovecraft line comes in the story \"The Shadow Over Innsmouth\", in which the foolhardy narrator, investigating what at first sight seems no more than an exorbitantly inbred backwoods New England town, sees something nasty in the woodshed, as it were, and says: \"It was the end, for whatever remains to me of life on the surface of this earth, of every vestige of mental peace and confidence in the integrity of Nature and the human mind.\" Now, while this is unfair on the human mind (what he has seen is only human, in the sense that HP Lovecraft invented it), it does show a deeply modern horror at the universe; the effect is something like the old sense of \"sublime\", but here set off by anthropophagic alien deities.

Those concerned for Flett's ideological purity, however, need not worry too much: we are sternly informed that the bash won't take place in Islington, but \"in the environs of the Marxism 2000 summer school\". \u0095 Further material for the AA Gill dossier. The great Scottish writer (as, in all seriousness, the Loafer once heard him introduced) finds himself used as puff material for someone else's book. \"Elizabeth David written by Quentin Tarantino\" enthuses Gill of Anthony Bourdain's Kitchen Confidential, the blood-and-guts memoir of a hellraising chef. Give yourself a treat by trying to envisage precisely what that description means - Bunfight at the OK Corral, perhaps? \u0095 Congratulations to Leila Aboulela, who has won the first Caine Prize for African Writing for her short story \"The Museum\". Ben Okri chaired the judges, and Aboulela will receive her $15,000 prize money this weekend in Harare to coincide with the Zimbabwe Book Fair.",

It was a perfect, wonderful coming of age. My brother was already in the team and my father had come to watch us. We went home and my father died in front of me. Horribly, in about half an hour. He had a heart attack.\" </p> <p>Anthony Browne was 17 that day and he has been painting images of his father ever since, culminating in his most recent, and most direct, My Dad. Ostensibly a simple tribute to a wonderful father, it is one of Browne's sunniest books, with a string of visual surprises enriching the brief and plain text. It comes after many darker takes on fathers. In one book, Gorilla, a fantasy gorilla becomes a stand-in father for a lonely young girl. In another, King Kong's fall from the Empire State Building becomes \"the image of my father falling dead in front of me\". </p> <p>His starting point for My Dad was the discovery of his father's old dressing-gown. \"It smelt like him and, hanging on a hanger, it looked like him. It just reminded me of how he was. I'd been wanting to do a positive book about fathers for some time but hadn't found the right way. The dressing gown was my starting point.\" </p> <p>Browne's sophisticated style, with its references to surrealism and his use of gorillas as interchangeable with humans, have made him one of the most intensely analysed and highly praised contemporary illustrators. Earlier this year he won the prestigious Hans Christian Andersen Medal - the first UK nominee to win it since Eleanor Farjeon in 1956. The competition included Dick Bruna, author of the Miffy books. </p> <p>\"Winning it has made me pleased that I've stuck to my guns,\" he says. \"I certainly haven't gone for a particular age range or audience and it's reassuring that that's considered to have worked.\" </p> <p>It seems odd to think that Browne needs reassurance, but he points out that he wasn't immediately successful. He had published seven books before winning the Kate Greenaway Medal for Gorilla in 1983. \"I've always felt that I was a bit of an outsider to the British children's-book illustration scene, because I don't work in line and wash. I work in watercolour and sometimes gouache, so obviously my books look very different from the line work of Cruickshank, Ardizzone or Shirley Hughes, who are thought of as the great British tradition.\" </p> <p>Trained at Leeds College of Art, Browne studied graphic design and originally wanted to be a painter. Needing to earn money, however, he took a job as a medical illustrator at Leeds Royal Infirmary. \"I was going through a very morbid phase following the death of my father which is probably why it suited me so well. The job involved going into operations and doing illustrations for medical students. I was showing the body as meat. Things like the liver had to look real, not like people think it does. I became very obsessed by fat, the way the globules looked. Technically it was an excellent training, and I learned how to use watercolour in a very tight way.\" </p> <p>But nobody was interested in his pictures as art, only for reference. \"There wasn't any scope for my imagination,\" Browne explains, \"so after a brief spell training as a teacher I did some work for an advertising agency - which I hated because it was all too literal.\"</p> <p>He had spent 15 years as a designer for Gordon Fraser's greetings cards before trying a picture book. The result was Through the Magic Mirror, which was closely based on Magritte. This first, simple story, which had too little plot and too much white space around the pictures, wasn't an immediate success. Nor was his second, A Walk in the Park, though Browne is now amused by the stinging criticism of one of his publisher's reps that he was \"on an ego trip because the books weren't for children, like the Mr Men\". </p> <p>He tried to be more \"for children\" in Bear Hunt, which was much brighter and more child-centred. But he still lacked confidence in his plot. \"I put in a lot of background to give another layer to the story. As a child I'd always liked cowboys and Indians stories where there were two layers - gruesome in the foreground but funny in the background. I used that as my model. I now use it more self-consciously.\" </p> <p>Both early works contain the references to the surrealist painters that are so much a part of his work, and who were a profound influence on him in adolescence. \"From 17 to 21 I was obsessed by sport and art. In art, I loved the pre-Raphaelites and Rembrandt first. Then I discovered Salvador Dali and it was like finding something I already knew.\" </p> <p>Many of these images are thought to be too sophisticated for the traditional children's-book market, which is why Browne's books have played a central role in the move towards picture books for older children. But drawing on other artists' work has also caused Browne some trouble. \"I've recently been sued by the Magritte estate for my fake reproductions of his work in Willy the Dreamer,\" he explains. \"My French publisher got a letter demanding that all the books be taken off the shelves as well as a lot of compensation. I thought that I was encouraging children to look at Magritte's pictures, but I had to take out all references to him for the new edition.\" </p> <p>Browne will not be stopped altogether, though. His future picture books will continue to be inspired by the great artists of the past. He will just be more discreet about how he uses their work.</p>",

Nor was his second, A Walk in the Park, though Browne is now amused by the stinging criticism of one of his publisher's reps that he was \"on an ego trip because the books weren't for children, like the Mr Men\". He tried to be more \"for children\" in Bear Hunt, which was much brighter and more child-centred. But he still lacked confidence in his plot. \"I put in a lot of background to give another layer to the story. As a child I'd always liked cowboys and Indians stories where there were two layers - gruesome in the foreground but funny in the background. I used that as my model. I now use it more self-consciously.\" Both early works contain the references to the surrealist painters that are so much a part of his work, and who were a profound influence on him in adolescence. \"From 17 to 21 I was obsessed by sport and art. In art, I loved the pre-Raphaelites and Rembrandt first. Then I discovered Salvador Dali and it was like finding something I already knew.\" Many of these images are thought to be too sophisticated for the traditional children's-book market, which is why Browne's books have played a central role in the move towards picture books for older children. But drawing on other artists' work has also caused Browne some trouble. \"I've recently been sued by the Magritte estate for my fake reproductions of his work in Willy the Dreamer,\" he explains. \"My French publisher got a letter demanding that all the books be taken off the shelves as well as a lot of compensation. I thought that I was encouraging children to look at Magritte's pictures, but I had to take out all references to him for the new edition.\" Browne will not be stopped altogether, though. His future picture books will continue to be inspired by the great artists of the past. He will just be more discreet about how he uses their work.",

Narrated by the bassist, David, it charts his relationship with the increasingly disturbed vocalist, Karl. Karl's final disintegration is followed by ugly revelations about his adolescence and some grimly abusive sex back in the bad old days of the 70s. It is a decade remembered here with no plastic nostalgia: the era of IRA pub bombings and Enoch Powell as folk hero. </p> <p>Lane's writing is faultlessly immediate, with nothing too clever and no foot put wrong. There is a simple, unforced vividness and peeled-back clarity of perception, whether he is describing atmospheric effects (\"You know how sometimes a gust of wind can bring the rain together so it makes a twisted shape and almost casts a shadow?\"), a poky hotel in Amsterdam (\"no lift or central staircase, only flights of stairs that joined up the landings at unexpected points\") or the pleasures of being traumatised and stressed out. \"Stress can heighten your enjoyment of things - films and music in particular. You watch and listen more closely, not sure how much is really there and how much is in your imagination.\" </p> <p>Live music is described with a nervous authenticity. You wonder how far the book is based on experience, with familiar reference points such as the music David likes (Jesus and Mary Chain, My Bloody Valentine) and the bands he gigs with (The Family Cat, who are real enough) leading to the fictional but chunkily quoted NME and Melody Maker reviews his band receives, the lyrics they write and the death of an unstable partner. All this is underpinned by Lane's rare attention to the Black Country. Digbeth, Stourbridge, Hockley and Moseley are evoked in all their depressing variety (here \"a district composed entirely of back streets\", elsewhere \"part Victorian, part futuristic\"). Is there really a K2 Indian restaurant in Moseley? If this book's convincing texture is anything to go by, I reckon there probably is. </p> <p>Hungover and broken up, the emotional landscapes are no less bleak. The hollow feeling of real life blows through the book like a chill, and we're told the music is no comfort either: \"Nobody wants to leave a gig feeling cold and empty inside.\" But - true to the indie ethos - another character counters: \"I'd rather listen to The Fall than U2. It's good to be reminded that things are complex.\" It is.</p>",

Narrated by the bassist, David, it charts his relationship with the increasingly disturbed vocalist, Karl. Karl's final disintegration is followed by ugly revelations about his adolescence and some grimly abusive sex back in the bad old days of the 70s. It is a decade remembered here with no plastic nostalgia: the era of IRA pub bombings and Enoch Powell as folk hero. Lane's writing is faultlessly immediate, with nothing too clever and no foot put wrong. There is a simple, unforced vividness and peeled-back clarity of perception, whether he is describing atmospheric effects (\"You know how sometimes a gust of wind can bring the rain together so it makes a twisted shape and almost casts a shadow?\"), a poky hotel in Amsterdam (\"no lift or central staircase, only flights of stairs that joined up the landings at unexpected points\") or the pleasures of being traumatised and stressed out. \"Stress can heighten your enjoyment of things - films and music in particular. You watch and listen more closely, not sure how much is really there and how much is in your imagination.\" Live music is described with a nervous authenticity. You wonder how far the book is based on experience, with familiar reference points such as the music David likes (Jesus and Mary Chain, My Bloody Valentine) and the bands he gigs with (The Family Cat, who are real enough) leading to the fictional but chunkily quoted NME and Melody Maker reviews his band receives, the lyrics they write and the death of an unstable partner. All this is underpinned by Lane's rare attention to the Black Country. Digbeth, Stourbridge, Hockley and Moseley are evoked in all their depressing variety (here \"a district composed entirely of back streets\", elsewhere \"part Victorian, part futuristic\"). Is there really a K2 Indian restaurant in Moseley? If this book's convincing texture is anything to go by, I reckon there probably is. Hungover and broken up, the emotional landscapes are no less bleak. The hollow feeling of real life blows through the book like a chill, and we're told the music is no comfort either: \"Nobody wants to leave a gig feeling cold and empty inside.\" But - true to the indie ethos - another character counters: \"I'd rather listen to The Fall than U2. It's good to be reminded that things are complex.\" It is.",

It was an original work, close to John Berger documenting peasant land before the final wild asparagus is rooted out, or perhaps Norman Lewis hearing the last voices from an old Spanish sea before the Germans throw down their towels. </p> <p>Honey made me speculate about Gray - there was something obliquely intriguing about this woman and her basil plants among the quarries of Carrera and Naxos, her past mentioned only in rare parentheses as she reduced the tomato crop to vats of sanguine sauce. The presence of her partner Norman, called \"the sculptor\" or \"the man of stone\", lent her sexiness - he was clearly worth the lack of plumbing in the barns on rocky outcrops where they dwelt. Gray's dishes might just about be approximated with ingredients from Waitrose, but her life was evidently savoury beyond imitation. I was very curious what she might write away from the pot of fava beans. </p> <p>Well, over a decade later, here are Gray's collected fascicoli - \"little bundles\" or pamphlets, which are her anti-autobiography. These are not scenes arranged in any linear time. Each bundle ties together a discrete event - an encounter with a spooked TS Eliot at a Sussex cocktail party, a gate never opened into a Palladian villa garden in the Veneto - but Gray does not foreshorten her life along the usual convergent lines of narrative. Perhaps the crucial paragraph of the book is her observation aboard a bus of an Italian landscape from a crazy angle that verifies the pre-perspective conventions of Gothic art: what is important zooms up big and close, the rest falls away, small. </p> <p>And that's how she treats her past. From far back, there looms a childhood scene of the 1920s: her father, a reverberatingly military man, lately arrived from Mesopotamia to set up a pig farm on heavy clay near Basingstoke, forces Gray's governess to walk a tusked boar; the swinish promenade ends with tears in a ditch. From the middle distance of 1958, there is a vignette of Gray's appointment as women's-page editor on the Observer: the phone call interrupts her ironing of a dress in which to fly to Naples, mission unspecified.</p> <p>Soon a certain George Seddon arrives from the Guardian to tell her \"he had discovered Observer readers to be mostly working men living in Victorian back-to-backs in the Midlands\" - so the paper begins \"to sing the deceptive but seductive joys of acquisition\" and Gray is dismissed: much she cares. </p> <p>There is an episode from 1964, set in a haunted Venice of flotsam on dazzling waters; Gray walks a roof parapet to find sanctuary after the greedy trafficking in artworks at the Biennale. After a long day on the Rialto among collectors and contessas, she remarks that \"the study of what human beings can do without has hardly begun\". This is her core belief: the necessary desire for less; the richness of the empty; the ultimate luxury of the minimal. </p> <p>Summarising Gray can make her style sound merely anecdotal and her adventures averagely picaresque, which they never are: not even when she couriers an early package tour on the Orient Express, aided only by Mr St Leger, paragon, ex-commando and expert at petit-point. As she writes, the alarms and excursions of Dalmatia 50 years ago drop away, and Gray remembers how happiness \"hummed about the pockmarked sunstruck walls of Diocletian's Palace\".</p> <p>She seems often surprised by happiness, which, she writes, \"embraces the traveller like a cloak\". Perhaps her childhood, spent on tiptoe to avoid provoking more parental reverberations, and her own solitary young motherhood (she discreetly bore and raised two children around 1940) left her unprepared for happiness, although she has a great capacity for enjoying it. </p> <p>And also for reveries, those subterranean, subaquatic connections now mostly impermissible in print. This book, with sketches and snaps strewn through the text, was originally put out by an Italian house, Edizioni Leucasia, and feels almost like samizdat publishing, because Gray writes of moments unvalued in an acquisitive age. </p> <p>There is a powerful undertow to all her memories: she mislays a key so archetypal it might be an icon for all locks, for the act of unlocking: she wounds her knee in the Alpes Maritimes and subsides on a clump of marestails, an ancient styptic that heals the cut in hours. And after the death of her friend Irving Davis - bibliophile, insect lover and cook, whose kitchen familiar was a bluebottle - she attends a party for the posthumous sale of his volumes; a bluebottle sips from her glass of champagne.</p> <p>These are not stories of enormous changes, nor of journeys with urgent appointments to keep (and there is only a single recipe, moreover one that, in its reliance on technique impossible to learn from the page, proves the pointlessness of cookbooks).

They have also been mollified by the fact that the scriptwriter is Shawn Slovo, daughter of Ruth First, the murdered anti-apartheid heroine, and Joe Slovo, former communist and ANC leader.</p> <p>\"Dr Zhivago is the movie we're making,\" producer Tim Bevan says. \"It's a big epic romance. The war is the backdrop to the movie and politics gears things up, because it's about life and death. But the argument over the politics and the civil war is as dull as ditchwater as far as we're concerned. What this is about is maintaining an emotional through-line for 100 minutes and making them cry a lot.\" The script was, the film-makers say, finalised before they started shooting, but director John Madden has since moved further away from the book. Along with the civil war, they have jettisoned several other of de Berni\u00e8res's most contested tales and characters, including the psychopathic partisan leader, Hector, and all the mainland partisan atrocity scenes. And, in contrast to the novel, Cephalonian andartes are indeed shown fighting side by side with the Italians against the Germans. The island authorities nevertheless remain nervous about how the movie will turn out. \"If they screw us,\" one senior official says of the film-makers, \"I don't know what we're going to do.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, excitement about the film on the island is being fanned in the Greek media: Robert de Niro is spotted visiting the set, Madonna is rumoured to be having dinner with Nic Cage - though it turns out she is only holidaying in nearby Ithaca. In the fishing village of Aghia Efimia, the Spanish actress Penelope Cruz, who plays Pelagia in the film, is reading El Pais in jeans in a cafe by the harbour, while John Hurt pays the bill at his regular table. Cage, who is generally surrounded by flunkies and has been busy mastering the mandolin, has not dropped in for a while. Until a couple of months ago, this was Cafe Dimitrios, but now it is Captain Corelli's Cafe, proclaimed in red-and-gold lettering above the awning. \"We changed it to please the film company,\" explains the cafe's Peter Anastas. \"The book has helped business and we hope the film does, too.\" But even he is sceptical about de Berni\u00e8res's story. \"That stuff the author wrote about the andartes and the communists is fantasy, but it doesn't matter because we know it's not true.\"</p> <p>The problem of novels and films that play fast and loose with history - and the grey area where artistic licence predominates - is a familiar one. In earlier editions, de Berni\u00e8res explained: \"Much of what I have written consists of hearsay tempered with myth and hazy memory, which, of course, is what history is.\" It is little wonder perhaps that the Princeton university historian Mark Mazower, author of a prize-winning account of wartime Greece, should have written recently: \"De Berni\u00e8res has a rather jaundiced, indeed biased, attitude towards the Greek left, and his understanding of what history is is not much better.\" But unlike other controversial historical movies such as The Patriot or Braveheart, Captain Corelli's Mandolin deals with events that took place in living memory - and the onslaught from survivors has now forced de Berni\u00e8res on to the back foot. </p> <p>When first privately taken to task after the book's initial publication, according to one critic, the author explained he had obtained some of the historical background from Alexandros Rallis, then working at the Greek embassy in London and a relative of Ionnis Rallis, Greece's quisling dictator under the Nazis. But, despite offering \"particular thanks\" to Rallis in the book's acknowledgements, de Berni\u00e8res insists that the embassy official provided only the date of a Greek Orthodox Easter during the war years and nothing else. Another of his cited sources is Helen Cosmatatos, an English-born Miss Marple character, who married a Cephalonian aristocrat and has lived in Argostoli since 1936. She stayed on the island throughout the war and is founder and guiding light of the magnificent Corgialenios cultural history museum.</p> <p>Cosmatatos gave de Berni\u00e8res reading lists and, according to her staff, corrected drafts of the novel. She has little love for the Greek left and her husband was arrested - though not mistreated, she says - by the resistance after the liberation. But even she now seems anxious to distance herself from the finished product. \"I know a good bit of it is not true, but it's not my business to start having arguments. Allowing the book to be translated into Greek, that was asking for trouble. I even had people in here from the government, cabinet ministers from Cephalonia, waving the book around. They were furious about it.\"</p> <p>In fact, de Berni\u00e8res had already had to agree that some of his \"language and opinions should be moderated\", as he put it, when the Greek edition of the novel was published. The following passage, for example, was deemed too much for Greek readers to take, and was excised on the advice of his publisher: \"In Cephalonia the communists began to deport awkward characters to concentration camps; from a safe distance they had watched the Nazis for years, and were well-versed in all the arts of atrocity and oppression. Hitler would have been proud of such assiduous pupils.\"</p> <p>Last month, the novelist began a more public, if limited, climbdown over Corelli, conceding he could have been wrong about the resistance. Whether in response to the pressure of the veterans' campaign on the film-makers or not, he explained that, while he \"had not actually changed my mind about what I think is the truth, I had to bear in mind the possibility that I might be wrong\". He did not, he said, want to stir up bad blood and the story of the resistance was \"extremely complex\" - adding, for good measure, that he regarded the persecution of communists in Greece after the war as an \"absolute disgrace\". In an email to the Guardian last week, he said he is \"no longer as sure of everything as I once was,\" and would be prepared to change his mind on the \"production of convincing evidence\". </p> <p>Both de Berni\u00e8res and Corelli film producer Kevin Loader like to emphasise how difficult it is to establish what really happened in Cephalonia during and after the German occupation. \"People have been telling each other stories for years and they give completely contradictory versions of events,\" Loader says. There are, in fact, extensive German, British, Italian and Greek records of the period and both Greek and foreign historians have written substantial accounts. But if there is one person more than any other who is in a position to know the truth of the events described in Captain Corelli's Mandolin, it is the former general manager of the Italian automobile club, Amos Pampaloni. For he, if anyone, is the real Captain Corelli.</p> <p>Now 89, Pampaloni lives with his wife, Marisa, in a flat near the sports stadium in his home town of Florence. He is a great bear of a man at 6ft 3in, alert and courteous to a degree. The son of a socialist railway official, he resisted pressure in the 30s to join the ubiquitous fascist organisations of Mussolini's dictatorship, though he was not involved in the political underground. Like de Berni\u00e8res's self-sacrificing gay giant, Carlo Guercio, he was called up and sent to the front when Italy invaded Greece in 1940, reluctantly fighting Mussolini's war of aggression through the bitter mountain winter in the teeth of dogged Greek resistance. And like de Berni\u00e8res's hero, Captain Corelli, Pampaloni was promoted to captain in the 33rd artillery regiment, Acqui division, and posted to Cephalonia as part of the occupation force. In fact, he was the only artillery captain on the island.</p> <p>Like Corelli, Pampaloni had an affair with a Cephalonian girl - though, whereas Corelli fell in love with Pelagia, the daughter of a doctor, Pampaloni's relationship was with Maria, a schoolteacher's daughter. Like Corelli, Pampaloni played a central role in the decision to launch the attack against German troops in Argostoli on September 13, 1943, after days of dithering by the generals. But whereas de Berni\u00e8res has a captain Fienzo Appollonio giving the order to fire on a flotilla of German landing craft, all the evidence - and Pampaloni's own testimony - suggests that it was he who took the initiative and gave the command to the artillery battery: \"Fuoco!\" There was a Renzo Appollonio who took part in the barrage, but he was a lieutenant under Pampaloni's command, stationed further down the hill and not in a position to see the German targets.</p> <p>Like Captain Corelli, Pampaloni was shot and left for dead by the victorious German troops amid the corpses of his fellow Italian soldiers, but miraculously survived, his wounds successfully treated by an untrained village doctor. But in an ironic twist to Corelli's dismissal of the Cephalonian andartes as \"bandits that loot the villages\", Pampaloni was actually rescued by the resistance movement and after his recovery joined the very ELAS guerillas held in such contempt by de Berni\u00e8res - fighting with them against the Germans on the Greek mainland for a year and returning with the ELAS 7th brigade to help liberate Cephalonia, where he was wounded again, in the autumn of 1944. </p> <p>He went back to his job at the automobile association in Italy after the war, only to find himself eventually facing a court-martial - brought at the insistence of the father of one of the victims of the Cephalonian massacres - for his decision to open fire in September 1943. Triumphantly cleared, he went on to be decorated by the Italian government for his heroism, hailed in the official citation as the \"soul of the resistance in Cephalonia\". To this day he remains a folk hero on the island. </p> <p>Leaning forward in an armchair in his Florence living room, Pampaloni recounts with mesmeric clarity his experience of the Cephalonian massacres - the centrepiece of the Corelli story. His battery had been moved to the village of Dilinata, where he and 80 other Italians were surrounded by German troops at dawn on September 22, 1943. \"After the soldiers had disarmed us, they began taking off our watches, chains, wallets and belts. I protested to the captain in charge that it was not permitted to take prisoners' personal effects. He replied through an interpreter: 'Not from prisoners, but from traitors, yes.' They told us to stand in a row and I was made to go at the end of the line, Lieutenant Tognato next to me. He called out to the soldiers to say their prayers, but I had no idea what was about to happen and I told him not to demoralise the men.</p> <p>\"The captain said, 'Let's go'. I took a step, he raised his pistol and fired a single shot at me. The bullet went through my neck and I was thrown to the ground by the impact. That must have been the signal for the massacre, because they then opened up with machine guns and I could hear the cries of our boys calling 'mamma' and 'Dio'. I never lost consciousness and felt one of the Germans take off my watch, which they had missed earlier because it was on my right hand. After about 10 minutes I heard the Germans march off, laughing and singing.\" With Tognato's body on top of his legs, he lay motionless, losing blood. \"Soldiers are like a family and I worried that maybe I was responsible for what had happened,\" he says, breaking down. \"The thing I remember is the terrible feeling of thirst and weakness.\"</p> <p>Eventually, he was found by a Greek boy, who brought him water and milk, and partisans bandaged his wounds. Stumbling towards Argostoli through the night to avoid German patrols, he eventually met a young woman resistance member, Maria Constantakis, who convinced him to hide and have his wounds treated at the house of her father, a village priest. Nicos Fokas, younger brother of the partisan Spiros, contacted the andartes at a base on Mount Aenos, where Pampaloni was taken a week or so later. </p> <p>De Berni\u00e8res denies that Pampaloni was the model for Captain Corelli: the character was, he says, inspired by his father's war stories from his time with the British 8th Army in Italy. The film producer Kevin Loader believes Corelli is an \"amalgam of Pampaloni and Appollonio\", but adds that, while they were anti-fascists, de Berni\u00e8res's hero is \"not remotely interested in politics, or being a soldier for that matter\". De Berni\u00e8res maintains he \"didn't know enough about Appollonio and Pampaloni at the time of writing to use them as a source of character\", adding, \"one of the problems of writing historical novels is that people deluge you with information when it is too late to be of any use\".</p> <p>Nevertheless, de Berni\u00e8res does cite a 60s Italian novel - The White Flag, by Marcello Venturi, which is explicitly based on Pampaloni's story - as a source in his own book's list of acknowledgements. De Berni\u00e8res's plot mirrors, to some extent, that of The White Flag - an Italian artillery captain on Cephalonia befriends a German and has an affair with a Greek girl, then becomes engulfed in the Italian-German confrontation of September 1943 and survives the subsequent massacres - though Corelli is a much longer, more ambitious and complex novel. De Berni\u00e8res says he \"read The White Flag after I had already decided on the bare bones of the story... I was slightly put off my own project when I found that The White Flag was about an Italian and a Greek girl, but I eventually decided that the important thing was to do it differently and to do it well.\" In any case, he says, reeling off a list of other influences, \"intertextuality\" is the stuff of post-modern fiction. </p> <p>Although aware of the Corelli book and film, Pampaloni himself had not read de Berni\u00e8res's novel until earlier this month when we approached him; he had not been able to find it previously because it is published in Italian under another title: Una Vita in Debito (A Life In Debt). He begins by looking for something positive to say. \"What is right in the book is that it shows war is a terrible, ugly thing and, just as we have seen in Kosovo, war is always unjust and violence always leads to more violence. But, like many Cephalonian critics, he winces at what he sees as the book's condescending national stereotyping of both Greeks and Italians, taking exception to the scenes of communal defecation and leisured mandolin-playing or opera-singing under conditions of military occupation - \"in fact, generally speaking, Italians don't play the mandolin, except in Naples\". The book is full of hopelessly unrealistic caricatures, he says. \"Judging by what he has written, Louis de Berni\u00e8res seems to regard the Italians and the Greeks as inferior races, as many British people did during the time of the empire.\"</p> <p>Speaking in a voice husky from a throat cancer operation - rather than the 57-year-old bullet wound in his neck - the Italian veteran's most withering comments are directed towards the novel's portrayal of the Greek resistance. He dismisses the suggestion that it was the British-backed EDES group that took on the Germans as laughable, and confirms that Cephalonian ELAS partisans did indeed fight and die alongside the Italians during September 1943. \"De Berni\u00e8res says the andartes used to kill peasants if they didn't hand over food, which is totally untrue. In my experience, 90% of the population welcomed them and helped them willingly.\" </p> <p>Nor does he recognise De Berni\u00e8res's portrayal of the ELAS andartes as torturers and rapists - on the contrary, he insists, the movement's discipline was ferocious over the treatment of women, recalling a highly-valued doctor in his partisan unit who was executed after he was accused by a Greek girl of rape. The guerilla war against the Germans was brutal, he concedes. Shortly after he joined ELAS on the mainland, he was shocked to see andartes cutting the throats of captured German soldiers. \"But you have to understand that in a partisan war you cannot take prisoners and each bullet is precious. It can save someone's life. </p> <p>\"I am on the left, but I am not a communist. However, the picture de Berni\u00e8res paints of the Greek partisans is unacceptable and completely wrong. To speak of the Greeks as barbarians, who killed for the sake of killing, is not only wrong and unjust, it is pandering to racism. I lived among them for 14 months and those months were an unforgettable experience, because of the partisans' sense of solidarity, kindness, altruism and fraternity.\"</p> <p>Pampaloni's happiest memory of Cephalonia is his arrival at the partisan base on Mount Aenos after the massacre. \"I cannot describe the warmth of the welcome I was given, or I will cry. I was at the end of my tether and all of them, men and women, embraced me, washed my face and feet, and gave me ouzo and fruit. Formally, we had been enemies a month before and now they treated me like this.\" In September, Pampaloni will return to the island for a commemoration of the Nazi slaughter with his fellow survivors and Greek resistance veterans. The bond between them has endured for more than half a century.</p>",

In the fishing village of Aghia Efimia, the Spanish actress Penelope Cruz, who plays Pelagia in the film, is reading El Pais in jeans in a cafe by the harbour, while John Hurt pays the bill at his regular table. Cage, who is generally surrounded by flunkies and has been busy mastering the mandolin, has not dropped in for a while. Until a couple of months ago, this was Cafe Dimitrios, but now it is Captain Corelli's Cafe, proclaimed in red-and-gold lettering above the awning. \"We changed it to please the film company,\" explains the cafe's Peter Anastas. \"The book has helped business and we hope the film does, too.\" But even he is sceptical about de Berni\u00e8res's story. \"That stuff the author wrote about the andartes and the communists is fantasy, but it doesn't matter because we know it's not true.\" The problem of novels and films that play fast and loose with history - and the grey area where artistic licence predominates - is a familiar one. In earlier editions, de Berni\u00e8res explained: \"Much of what I have written consists of hearsay tempered with myth and hazy memory, which, of course, is what history is.\" It is little wonder perhaps that the Princeton university historian Mark Mazower, author of a prize-winning account of wartime Greece, should have written recently: \"De Berni\u00e8res has a rather jaundiced, indeed biased, attitude towards the Greek left, and his understanding of what history is is not much better.\" But unlike other controversial historical movies such as The Patriot or Braveheart, Captain Corelli's Mandolin deals with events that took place in living memory - and the onslaught from survivors has now forced de Berni\u00e8res on to the back foot. When first privately taken to task after the book's initial publication, according to one critic, the author explained he had obtained some of the historical background from Alexandros Rallis, then working at the Greek embassy in London and a relative of Ionnis Rallis, Greece's quisling dictator under the Nazis. But, despite offering \"particular thanks\" to Rallis in the book's acknowledgements, de Berni\u00e8res insists that the embassy official provided only the date of a Greek Orthodox Easter during the war years and nothing else. Another of his cited sources is Helen Cosmatatos, an English-born Miss Marple character, who married a Cephalonian aristocrat and has lived in Argostoli since 1936. She stayed on the island throughout the war and is founder and guiding light of the magnificent Corgialenios cultural history museum. Cosmatatos gave de Berni\u00e8res reading lists and, according to her staff, corrected drafts of the novel. She has little love for the Greek left and her husband was arrested - though not mistreated, she says - by the resistance after the liberation. But even she now seems anxious to distance herself from the finished product. \"I know a good bit of it is not true, but it's not my business to start having arguments. Allowing the book to be translated into Greek, that was asking for trouble. I even had people in here from the government, cabinet ministers from Cephalonia, waving the book around. They were furious about it.\" In fact, de Berni\u00e8res had already had to agree that some of his \"language and opinions should be moderated\", as he put it, when the Greek edition of the novel was published. The following passage, for example, was deemed too much for Greek readers to take, and was excised on the advice of his publisher: \"In Cephalonia the communists began to deport awkward characters to concentration camps; from a safe distance they had watched the Nazis for years, and were well-versed in all the arts of atrocity and oppression. Hitler would have been proud of such assiduous pupils.\" Last month, the novelist began a more public, if limited, climbdown over Corelli, conceding he could have been wrong about the resistance. Whether in response to the pressure of the veterans' campaign on the film-makers or not, he explained that, while he \"had not actually changed my mind about what I think is the truth, I had to bear in mind the possibility that I might be wrong\". He did not, he said, want to stir up bad blood and the story of the resistance was \"extremely complex\" - adding, for good measure, that he regarded the persecution of communists in Greece after the war as an \"absolute disgrace\". In an email to the Guardian last week, he said he is \"no longer as sure of everything as I once was,\" and would be prepared to change his mind on the \"production of convincing evidence\". Both de Berni\u00e8res and Corelli film producer Kevin Loader like to emphasise how difficult it is to establish what really happened in Cephalonia during and after the German occupation. \"People have been telling each other stories for years and they give completely contradictory versions of events,\" Loader says. There are, in fact, extensive German, British, Italian and Greek records of the period and both Greek and foreign historians have written substantial accounts. But if there is one person more than any other who is in a position to know the truth of the events described in Captain Corelli's Mandolin, it is the former general manager of the Italian automobile club, Amos Pampaloni. For he, if anyone, is the real Captain Corelli. Now 89, Pampaloni lives with his wife, Marisa, in a flat near the sports stadium in his home town of Florence. He is a great bear of a man at 6ft 3in, alert and courteous to a degree. The son of a socialist railway official, he resisted pressure in the 30s to join the ubiquitous fascist organisations of Mussolini's dictatorship, though he was not involved in the political underground. Like de Berni\u00e8res's self-sacrificing gay giant, Carlo Guercio, he was called up and sent to the front when Italy invaded Greece in 1940, reluctantly fighting Mussolini's war of aggression through the bitter mountain winter in the teeth of dogged Greek resistance. And like de Berni\u00e8res's hero, Captain Corelli, Pampaloni was promoted to captain in the 33rd artillery regiment, Acqui division, and posted to Cephalonia as part of the occupation force. In fact, he was the only artillery captain on the island. Like Corelli, Pampaloni had an affair with a Cephalonian girl - though, whereas Corelli fell in love with Pelagia, the daughter of a doctor, Pampaloni's relationship was with Maria, a schoolteacher's daughter. Like Corelli, Pampaloni played a central role in the decision to launch the attack against German troops in Argostoli on September 13, 1943, after days of dithering by the generals. But whereas de Berni\u00e8res has a captain Fienzo Appollonio giving the order to fire on a flotilla of German landing craft, all the evidence - and Pampaloni's own testimony - suggests that it was he who took the initiative and gave the command to the artillery battery: \"Fuoco!\" There was a Renzo Appollonio who took part in the barrage, but he was a lieutenant under Pampaloni's command, stationed further down the hill and not in a position to see the German targets. Like Captain Corelli, Pampaloni was shot and left for dead by the victorious German troops amid the corpses of his fellow Italian soldiers, but miraculously survived, his wounds successfully treated by an untrained village doctor. But in an ironic twist to Corelli's dismissal of the Cephalonian andartes as \"bandits that loot the villages\", Pampaloni was actually rescued by the resistance movement and after his recovery joined the very ELAS guerillas held in such contempt by de Berni\u00e8res - fighting with them against the Germans on the Greek mainland for a year and returning with the ELAS 7th brigade to help liberate Cephalonia, where he was wounded again, in the autumn of 1944. He went back to his job at the automobile association in Italy after the war, only to find himself eventually facing a court-martial - brought at the insistence of the father of one of the victims of the Cephalonian massacres - for his decision to open fire in September 1943. Triumphantly cleared, he went on to be decorated by the Italian government for his heroism, hailed in the official citation as the \"soul of the resistance in Cephalonia\". To this day he remains a folk hero on the island. Leaning forward in an armchair in his Florence living room, Pampaloni recounts with mesmeric clarity his experience of the Cephalonian massacres - the centrepiece of the Corelli story. His battery had been moved to the village of Dilinata, where he and 80 other Italians were surrounded by German troops at dawn on September 22, 1943. \"After the soldiers had disarmed us, they began taking off our watches, chains, wallets and belts. I protested to the captain in charge that it was not permitted to take prisoners' personal effects. He replied through an interpreter: 'Not from prisoners, but from traitors, yes.' They told us to stand in a row and I was made to go at the end of the line, Lieutenant Tognato next to me. He called out to the soldiers to say their prayers, but I had no idea what was about to happen and I told him not to demoralise the men. \"The captain said, 'Let's go'. I took a step, he raised his pistol and fired a single shot at me. The bullet went through my neck and I was thrown to the ground by the impact. That must have been the signal for the massacre, because they then opened up with machine guns and I could hear the cries of our boys calling 'mamma' and 'Dio'. I never lost consciousness and felt one of the Germans take off my watch, which they had missed earlier because it was on my right hand. After about 10 minutes I heard the Germans march off, laughing and singing.\" With Tognato's body on top of his legs, he lay motionless, losing blood. \"Soldiers are like a family and I worried that maybe I was responsible for what had happened,\" he says, breaking down. \"The thing I remember is the terrible feeling of thirst and weakness.\" Eventually, he was found by a Greek boy, who brought him water and milk, and partisans bandaged his wounds. Stumbling towards Argostoli through the night to avoid German patrols, he eventually met a young woman resistance member, Maria Constantakis, who convinced him to hide and have his wounds treated at the house of her father, a village priest. Nicos Fokas, younger brother of the partisan Spiros, contacted the andartes at a base on Mount Aenos, where Pampaloni was taken a week or so later. De Berni\u00e8res denies that Pampaloni was the model for Captain Corelli: the character was, he says, inspired by his father's war stories from his time with the British 8th Army in Italy. The film producer Kevin Loader believes Corelli is an \"amalgam of Pampaloni and Appollonio\", but adds that, while they were anti-fascists, de Berni\u00e8res's hero is \"not remotely interested in politics, or being a soldier for that matter\". De Berni\u00e8res maintains he \"didn't know enough about Appollonio and Pampaloni at the time of writing to use them as a source of character\", adding, \"one of the problems of writing historical novels is that people deluge you with information when it is too late to be of any use\". Nevertheless, de Berni\u00e8res does cite a 60s Italian novel - The White Flag, by Marcello Venturi, which is explicitly based on Pampaloni's story - as a source in his own book's list of acknowledgements. De Berni\u00e8res's plot mirrors, to some extent, that of The White Flag - an Italian artillery captain on Cephalonia befriends a German and has an affair with a Greek girl, then becomes engulfed in the Italian-German confrontation of September 1943 and survives the subsequent massacres - though Corelli is a much longer, more ambitious and complex novel. De Berni\u00e8res says he \"read The White Flag after I had already decided on the bare bones of the story... I was slightly put off my own project when I found that The White Flag was about an Italian and a Greek girl, but I eventually decided that the important thing was to do it differently and to do it well.\" In any case, he says, reeling off a list of other influences, \"intertextuality\" is the stuff of post-modern fiction. Although aware of the Corelli book and film, Pampaloni himself had not read de Berni\u00e8res's novel until earlier this month when we approached him; he had not been able to find it previously because it is published in Italian under another title: Una Vita in Debito (A Life In Debt). He begins by looking for something positive to say. \"What is right in the book is that it shows war is a terrible, ugly thing and, just as we have seen in Kosovo, war is always unjust and violence always leads to more violence. But, like many Cephalonian critics, he winces at what he sees as the book's condescending national stereotyping of both Greeks and Italians, taking exception to the scenes of communal defecation and leisured mandolin-playing or opera-singing under conditions of military occupation - \"in fact, generally speaking, Italians don't play the mandolin, except in Naples\". The book is full of hopelessly unrealistic caricatures, he says. \"Judging by what he has written, Louis de Berni\u00e8res seems to regard the Italians and the Greeks as inferior races, as many British people did during the time of the empire.\" Speaking in a voice husky from a throat cancer operation - rather than the 57-year-old bullet wound in his neck - the Italian veteran's most withering comments are directed towards the novel's portrayal of the Greek resistance. He dismisses the suggestion that it was the British-backed EDES group that took on the Germans as laughable, and confirms that Cephalonian ELAS partisans did indeed fight and die alongside the Italians during September 1943. \"De Berni\u00e8res says the andartes used to kill peasants if they didn't hand over food, which is totally untrue. In my experience, 90% of the population welcomed them and helped them willingly.\" Nor does he recognise De Berni\u00e8res's portrayal of the ELAS andartes as torturers and rapists - on the contrary, he insists, the movement's discipline was ferocious over the treatment of women, recalling a highly-valued doctor in his partisan unit who was executed after he was accused by a Greek girl of rape. The guerilla war against the Germans was brutal, he concedes. Shortly after he joined ELAS on the mainland, he was shocked to see andartes cutting the throats of captured German soldiers. \"But you have to understand that in a partisan war you cannot take prisoners and each bullet is precious. It can save someone's life. \"I am on the left, but I am not a communist. However, the picture de Berni\u00e8res paints of the Greek partisans is unacceptable and completely wrong. To speak of the Greeks as barbarians, who killed for the sake of killing, is not only wrong and unjust, it is pandering to racism. I lived among them for 14 months and those months were an unforgettable experience, because of the partisans' sense of solidarity, kindness, altruism and fraternity.\" Pampaloni's happiest memory of Cephalonia is his arrival at the partisan base on Mount Aenos after the massacre. \"I cannot describe the warmth of the welcome I was given, or I will cry. I was at the end of my tether and all of them, men and women, embraced me, washed my face and feet, and gave me ouzo and fruit. Formally, we had been enemies a month before and now they treated me like this.\" In September, Pampaloni will return to the island for a commemoration of the Nazi slaughter with his fellow survivors and Greek resistance veterans. The bond between them has endured for more than half a century.",

      "body": "<p>For countless British enthusiasts, Captain Corelli's Mandolin is an enchanting literary tour de force, an epic wartime love story with the authentic flavour of Greek island life, still the ideal beach accessory for the discerning holidaymaker. Compared by AS Byatt to the work of Charles Dickens and hailed as \"absolutely brilliant\" by the television presenter Jeremy Paxman, the book became a publishing phenomenon of the late 90s, the New Labour politician's novel of the moment. Hugh Grant was even shown engrossed in the paperback in the final scene of Notting Hill, Britain's most successful film. To date, the book has sold 1.5 million copies, clocking up 240 weeks on the bestseller list - making its author, Louis de Berni\u00e8res, a rich man and sending an electric current through the tourist industry on the island of Cephalonia, where it is set. </p> <p>Now Captain Corelli is about to become a \u00a345 million Hollywood-backed movie in its own right, starring Nicolas Cage, Penelope Cruz and John Hurt, and currently being shot in Cephalonia by the same British company that made Notting Hill. When the film goes on release some time next year, the existing de Berni\u00e8res tourist boom on the island seems likely to turn into full-scale Corellimania. Already, bars and restaurants are being re-named after the novel's eponymous hero, racks of glossy guides to \"Captain Corelli's Island\" have gone on sale, legends proliferate about the prices the film-makers will pay for imported donkeys, and business around the port of Sami - where the main filming is taking place - has never been brisker. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Greek government has provided minesweepers, landing craft and hundreds of soldiers; half the waterfront at Sami has been requisitioned for a reconstruction of the capital, Argostoli, as it was in the 40s, and Cephalonians have been signing up in their scores to be extras in the film. De Berni\u00e8res recently made a triumphal tour of the set, joshing with the actors and feasting on the fruits of his achievement. \"This is a big thing for Cephalonia,\" declares Kevin Loader, one of the film's producers, as he suns himself outside a quayside Sami cafe, surveying a mocked-up blackened bell tower used in the previous day's shoot. \"It's a big thing to happen to Greece,\" adds fellow producer Tim Bevan. \"This is going to be Britain's biggest film next year, and it's a lot of people's favourite book in the UK. The last film on this scale to be made in Greece was the Guns Of Navarone, and I'm convinced most of that was shot in Italy, anyway.\"</p> <p>But for all the extra income, large numbers of Cephalonians are deeply ambivalent about the Corelli phenomenon, and are far from being as grateful for their new-found celebrity as the film-makers seem to think they should be. The problem is not so much the downside of the expected tourist invasion, or the occasional traumatic flashback triggered by the sound of gunfire from the film set. For many of the older generation, who lived through the events described in de Berni\u00e8res's book, his story is a slur on the record of the Greek resistance to the Nazis and a mish-mash of distortions and untruths about their island's wartime history. For the Cephalonian resistance veterans themselves, and for one uniquely-placed Italian officer and survivor of the Nazi terror on the island, Captain Corelli's Mandolin is a travesty - an inexcusable attempt to rewrite the story of their lives.</p> <p>Dionisis Georgatos - the elected governor of Cephalonia who negotiated carefully-framed terms for the Corelli film to be made on the island - dismisses de Berni\u00e8res's book as \"reactionary and wrong\". Nobody, he says, wants to benefit from the film \"if it distorts our history - we had many deaths, houses were burned, people hanged in the streets. It is very sensitive. De Berni\u00e8res clearly used British sources from that time and, of course, they had the role of invaders.\" Gerasimos Artelanis, mayor of Sami and, like Georgatos, a member of Greece's ruling socialist party, Pasok, has threatened to take the film-makers to the International Court of Justice if they include de Berni\u00e8res's most controversial claims, thus breaking an undertaking not to inflame political and national sensitivities. </p> <p>\"We are at war with Louis de Berni\u00e8res,\" explains Lefteris Eleftheratos, a 72-year-old former Cephalonian journalist and unofficial leader of the Greek campaign against the novel. \"It is a defensive war because it is a war he declared on us.\" A teenage recruit to the resistance youth organisation during the Italian fascist and Nazi German occupations of the island - his father was imprisoned by the Germans after a collaborator's tip-off - Eleftheratos was forced into political exile during the ensuing civil war and spent 11 years working his way around the world, from Mao's China to Ethiopia and Australia, where he picked up the nickname Lefty Freeman. Now he is writing a book to counter de Berni\u00e8res's version of the island's history and what he sees as its portrayal of Cephalonians as primitive and inhuman. \"We are not against the film,\" he says carefully, in an Australian-Greek accent. \"We know what the film means for the island as a source of income. But de Berni\u00e8res's book is a libel on my country and its people. And we're not going to place money over what we believe to be sacred to us: our philotimo, our personal and national dignity.\" </p> <p>Such reactions can come as something of a surprise to foreign readers for whom the novel's historical backdrop has little of the neuralgic resonance it has for Greeks. Set against the background of an Ionian Arcadia, Captain Corelli's Mandolin is the story of an unconsummated love affair between Pelagia, the daughter of a patriotic Cephalonian doctor, and Antonio Corelli, an amiable, mandolin-playing artillery captain in the Italian army of occupation. The relationship flourishes when Pelagia's fianc\u00e9, Mandras, traumatised by the Greek-Italian war of 1940-1941, goes off to fight with the partisans on the mainland. The opera-loving Corelli befriends a \"good Nazi\" from the German garrison, but is then engulfed in the conflagrationary events of September 1943, when - after Italy declared an armistice with the allies - Italian troops on the island refused to surrender to the Germans and fought desperately for 10 bloody days. Overwhelmed, more than 9,000 Italian soldiers on Cephalonia were either massacred on Hitler's personal orders or drowned as they were deported by ship.</p> <p>In de Berni\u00e8res's novel, Captain Corelli, of the 33rd artillery regiment, Acqui division, is one of those who first open fire on the Germans and later miraculously survives the mass executions, his wounds successfully treated by Pelagia's father. Spurred on by the sacrifice of his fellow soldiers, he returns to Italy to do his bit for the war against Germany as a fireman. The lovers are not reunited until their old age, in modern-day Cephalonia.</p> <p>But woven into this human drama is a one-sided account of the history of the period, and a crude and unremittingly hostile portrayal of the Greek communists in particular, who led the resistance against the Italian and German occupations and later fought British and American-backed forces in the civil war of the late 40s. In a series of jarring interludes, de Berni\u00e8res offers a notably sympathetic portrait of the pre-war Greek dictator Metaxas - a man responsible for the torture, imprisonment and murder of thousands of left-wing political opponents - while Mussolini's occupation army, fresh from its genocidal sweeps through Ethiopia and Libya, is presented as a collection of harmless, fun-loving rogues.</p> <p>By contrast, the main Greek resistance organisation, ELAS - which, according to the German army's own records, killed more than 8,000 German soldiers in little over a year, tied down tens of thousands more and controlled 80% of the country when Hitler withdrew - is depicted as a gang of torturers, ignorant demagogues and cowards, who spent the war \"doing absolutely nothing\" except stealing food from peasants and murdering guerillas from smaller rival, British-backed resistance groups. Of the three communist characters in the novel, Hector is a sadistic monster, Mandras a rapist and Kokolios a penitent who swiftly abandons his political foolishness before being shot by his former comrades.</p> <p>Greece was the only country liberated from the Nazis where British troops fought the resistance - second only in scale to Tito's partisan movement in Yugoslavia - to impose a pro-western authoritarian regime after the German withdrawal. In a policy that was bitterly attacked across the political spectrum in Britain, Churchill ordered General Scobie, in December 1944, to behave in Athens \"as if you were in a conquered city\". </p> <p>While de Berni\u00e8res claims in the novel that ELAS and its million-strong political umbrella group, EAM, lorded it over the population in Cephalonia and elsewhere as Greece plunged into civil war, he is silent about the white terror that followed the British occupation, or the incorporation of the Nazis' detested Greek collaborators into the new order, or the mass internment, exile and killing of tens of thousands of left-wing activists. And nowhere is there any reflection of the flowering of self-government in the areas liberated by the resistance, of the fact that women were given the vote for the first time in Greek history - or of the part played by ELAS in rescuing Greek Jews from transportation to the Nazi death camps.</p> <p>Until the 70s, it was still a crime in Greece to have fought against the Nazis in the main wartime resistance movement, while Nazi collaborators received pensions. The role of the ELAS \"andartes\", or guerillas, in the liberation was formally recognised by the state only under Andreas Papandreou in the 80s. But, in case any reader might have mistaken his own view, de Berni\u00e8res included an author's note in earlier editions of Captain Corelli's Mandolin to berate \"disconnected intellectuals\" for regarding the Greek communists as \"romantic heroes\", adding, \"when they were not totally useless, perfidious and parasitic, they were unspeakably barbaric\".</p> <p>Makis Faraklos, now the 76-year-old president of the resistance veterans' association in the Cephalonian town of Lixouri, remembers witnessing the fate of some of those whom de Berni\u00e8res insists spent the German occupation doing nothing. \"On June 5, 1944, the Germans hanged five resistance members in the main square because the andartes had killed a collaborator. They forced everyone they found on the streets to go there and set up four machine guns around us. One of the five, Dionisis Ratsiatos, was my teacher - I loved that man. There was a father and son, Gavrilis and Vasilis Rallatos, and the father was forced to watch his son hanged twice, because the rope broke the first time they strung him up. They hanged them from two trees. The youngest to die that day was Spiros Analitis, in his early 20s. The German commander announced through an interpreter that he would be freed if he gave information about the resistance. Analitis didn't reply, but called to the crowd, 'You, tyranny-fighting youth, will avenge our deaths.' \"</p> <p>There is a plaque marking the spot where the five hanged, as there are monuments all over the island commemorating resistance fighters killed during the occupation or the civil war. In Zervata, in the mountains above Sami, a bust of the legendary Cephalonian ELAS commander, Astrapioannos, is the centrepiece of a garden of remembrance to the fallen partisans. Further up the mountainside, surrounded by caves and now inhabited only by goats and wild dogs, lie the ruins of the village of Mouzakata, his wartime guerilla hide-out - first bombed by the Germans, later by government forces with British support during the civil war, and finally abandoned after Cephalonia's devastating 1953 earthquake.</p> <p>Another of de Berni\u00e8res's \"barbarians\" - Argostoli's retired theatre director, the 83-year-old opera-singing Spiros Fokas - keeps a pair of Wehrmacht jackboots by the bar in his hotel. They belonged, he explains, to a German soldier he shot in an ambush of two troop carriers on the road between Sami and Aghia Efimia. Fokas, who spent almost a year fighting with ELAS on the mainland during the war, had been sent back to Cephalonia with three other andartes as a scouting group in the last phase of the German occupation. He went on to take part in other attacks on German forces as they retreated from the island. For his pains, he was persecuted and imprisoned in the 50s and 60s, and his son, now a professor at Imperial College in London, was forced to study abroad. </p> <p>But of all de Berni\u00e8res's disparaging claims about the Cephalonian resistance, perhaps the most deeply resented by the island's veterans is his insistence that the movement refused to come to the aid of the Italians when they turned on their former German allies at such terrible cost in the autumn of 1943. It is \"certain\", the British soldier-turned-author declares in the novel, that the \"communist andartes of ELAS took no part, seeing no reason to shake themselves out of their parasitic lethargy\". Later, he even has the heroine, Pelagia, hearing that the partisans have been \"killing off\" Italians who came to fight alongside them against the Germans. </p> <p>From the islanders' point of view, no charge could be more wounding. The Italian-German confrontation and subsequent massacres were a defining moment of modern Cephalonian history. The only resistance force on the island was ELAS and its political wing, EAM, though neither organisation was exclusively, or even predominantly, communist. Both Greeks and Italian survivors testify that not only did the resistance give practical and armed support to the Italian troops, but 15 andartes lost their lives in the fighting. Far from killing Italians who escaped the German slaughter, the resistance - including the parents of Dionisis Georgatos, Cephalonia's present-day governor - hid them and helped spirit them off the island.</p> <p>Dimitrios Podimatas, a 78-year-old Cepha-lonian communist resistance veteran, remembers five of those who died in the Italian- German clashes of September 1943. \"A party of 12 people was picked from my village, Mousata, by the resistance and sent to fight the Germans in Omala near the monastery of St Gerasimos. I didn't go because I was sick at the time, but my brother went. The Germans intercepted the group at Dilinata on September 20 and shot five of them. One of those killed was my cousin, Gerasimos Podimatas. He lived in our house and was very popular in the village. To a small community like this, it was a disaster, a psychological trauma.\" The names of the five who met their deaths that day are recorded on a memorial. Podimatas - who between 1946 and 1971 spent a total of 17 years in prison or camps without trial for his political activity - weeps as he tells the story.</p> <p>Even Podimatas's record of persecution fails to match the experience of Vangelis Neochorotis, a 91-year-old Cephalonian veteran of both the resistance and the Greek-Italian war of 1940-1941, who spent 21 years in prison and whose brother was executed during the civil war. Both he and his brother, like thousands of others, refused an offer of release if they signed a statement renouncing communism. Sitting in the garden of the house in Paliki he has lived in since the 30s with his wife Amalia - herself a former EAM member who was tortured after the war - Neochorotis gives his view of the Corelli story: \"De Berni\u00e8res's book is an insult to the whole Greek people. But I believe it is also part of a global drive to rewrite history, to reverse historical facts, to convince people that political and social change is a dead end and that if you struggle for a better world, it only leads to bloodshed, suffering and failure.\" </p> <p>The backlash against Captain Corelli was a slow-burn affair. When the novel was first translated into Greek, the communist paper, Rizospastis, accidentally gave it a glowing review, lifted in haste from a news agency. But by the time the film-makers came to recce the island two years ago, the campaign was already up and running, with angry letters in the Athens press and delegations to Cephalonia's political leaders. The Greek islands have traditionally been dominated by the left, and Cephalonia is no exception, with the communists still winning 12% of the vote and the combined left-of-centre parties scooping up more than 60%. One typical protest to the island's governor, from the local League of High School Teachers, thundered that de Berni\u00e8res's book \"distorts and slanders the Greek struggle during the occupation\" and proceeded to list, page by page, what it regarded as factual errors. </p> <p>The controversy first surfaced in Britain last year, when a mauling at the hands of the Morning Star finally aroused de Berni\u00e8res from his literary lair.

      "bodyText": "For countless British enthusiasts, Captain Corelli's Mandolin is an enchanting literary tour de force, an epic wartime love story with the authentic flavour of Greek island life, still the ideal beach accessory for the discerning holidaymaker. Compared by AS Byatt to the work of Charles Dickens and hailed as \"absolutely brilliant\" by the television presenter Jeremy Paxman, the book became a publishing phenomenon of the late 90s, the New Labour politician's novel of the moment. Hugh Grant was even shown engrossed in the paperback in the final scene of Notting Hill, Britain's most successful film. To date, the book has sold 1.5 million copies, clocking up 240 weeks on the bestseller list - making its author, Louis de Berni\u00e8res, a rich man and sending an electric current through the tourist industry on the island of Cephalonia, where it is set. Now Captain Corelli is about to become a \u00a345 million Hollywood-backed movie in its own right, starring Nicolas Cage, Penelope Cruz and John Hurt, and currently being shot in Cephalonia by the same British company that made Notting Hill. When the film goes on release some time next year, the existing de Berni\u00e8res tourist boom on the island seems likely to turn into full-scale Corellimania. Already, bars and restaurants are being re-named after the novel's eponymous hero, racks of glossy guides to \"Captain Corelli's Island\" have gone on sale, legends proliferate about the prices the film-makers will pay for imported donkeys, and business around the port of Sami - where the main filming is taking place - has never been brisker. Meanwhile, the Greek government has provided minesweepers, landing craft and hundreds of soldiers; half the waterfront at Sami has been requisitioned for a reconstruction of the capital, Argostoli, as it was in the 40s, and Cephalonians have been signing up in their scores to be extras in the film. De Berni\u00e8res recently made a triumphal tour of the set, joshing with the actors and feasting on the fruits of his achievement. \"This is a big thing for Cephalonia,\" declares Kevin Loader, one of the film's producers, as he suns himself outside a quayside Sami cafe, surveying a mocked-up blackened bell tower used in the previous day's shoot. \"It's a big thing to happen to Greece,\" adds fellow producer Tim Bevan. \"This is going to be Britain's biggest film next year, and it's a lot of people's favourite book in the UK. The last film on this scale to be made in Greece was the Guns Of Navarone, and I'm convinced most of that was shot in Italy, anyway.\" But for all the extra income, large numbers of Cephalonians are deeply ambivalent about the Corelli phenomenon, and are far from being as grateful for their new-found celebrity as the film-makers seem to think they should be. The problem is not so much the downside of the expected tourist invasion, or the occasional traumatic flashback triggered by the sound of gunfire from the film set. For many of the older generation, who lived through the events described in de Berni\u00e8res's book, his story is a slur on the record of the Greek resistance to the Nazis and a mish-mash of distortions and untruths about their island's wartime history. For the Cephalonian resistance veterans themselves, and for one uniquely-placed Italian officer and survivor of the Nazi terror on the island, Captain Corelli's Mandolin is a travesty - an inexcusable attempt to rewrite the story of their lives. Dionisis Georgatos - the elected governor of Cephalonia who negotiated carefully-framed terms for the Corelli film to be made on the island - dismisses de Berni\u00e8res's book as \"reactionary and wrong\". Nobody, he says, wants to benefit from the film \"if it distorts our history - we had many deaths, houses were burned, people hanged in the streets. It is very sensitive. De Berni\u00e8res clearly used British sources from that time and, of course, they had the role of invaders.\" Gerasimos Artelanis, mayor of Sami and, like Georgatos, a member of Greece's ruling socialist party, Pasok, has threatened to take the film-makers to the International Court of Justice if they include de Berni\u00e8res's most controversial claims, thus breaking an undertaking not to inflame political and national sensitivities. \"We are at war with Louis de Berni\u00e8res,\" explains Lefteris Eleftheratos, a 72-year-old former Cephalonian journalist and unofficial leader of the Greek campaign against the novel. \"It is a defensive war because it is a war he declared on us.\" A teenage recruit to the resistance youth organisation during the Italian fascist and Nazi German occupations of the island - his father was imprisoned by the Germans after a collaborator's tip-off - Eleftheratos was forced into political exile during the ensuing civil war and spent 11 years working his way around the world, from Mao's China to Ethiopia and Australia, where he picked up the nickname Lefty Freeman. Now he is writing a book to counter de Berni\u00e8res's version of the island's history and what he sees as its portrayal of Cephalonians as primitive and inhuman. \"We are not against the film,\" he says carefully, in an Australian-Greek accent. \"We know what the film means for the island as a source of income. But de Berni\u00e8res's book is a libel on my country and its people. And we're not going to place money over what we believe to be sacred to us: our philotimo, our personal and national dignity.\" Such reactions can come as something of a surprise to foreign readers for whom the novel's historical backdrop has little of the neuralgic resonance it has for Greeks. Set against the background of an Ionian Arcadia, Captain Corelli's Mandolin is the story of an unconsummated love affair between Pelagia, the daughter of a patriotic Cephalonian doctor, and Antonio Corelli, an amiable, mandolin-playing artillery captain in the Italian army of occupation. The relationship flourishes when Pelagia's fianc\u00e9, Mandras, traumatised by the Greek-Italian war of 1940-1941, goes off to fight with the partisans on the mainland. The opera-loving Corelli befriends a \"good Nazi\" from the German garrison, but is then engulfed in the conflagrationary events of September 1943, when - after Italy declared an armistice with the allies - Italian troops on the island refused to surrender to the Germans and fought desperately for 10 bloody days. Overwhelmed, more than 9,000 Italian soldiers on Cephalonia were either massacred on Hitler's personal orders or drowned as they were deported by ship. In de Berni\u00e8res's novel, Captain Corelli, of the 33rd artillery regiment, Acqui division, is one of those who first open fire on the Germans and later miraculously survives the mass executions, his wounds successfully treated by Pelagia's father. Spurred on by the sacrifice of his fellow soldiers, he returns to Italy to do his bit for the war against Germany as a fireman. The lovers are not reunited until their old age, in modern-day Cephalonia. But woven into this human drama is a one-sided account of the history of the period, and a crude and unremittingly hostile portrayal of the Greek communists in particular, who led the resistance against the Italian and German occupations and later fought British and American-backed forces in the civil war of the late 40s. In a series of jarring interludes, de Berni\u00e8res offers a notably sympathetic portrait of the pre-war Greek dictator Metaxas - a man responsible for the torture, imprisonment and murder of thousands of left-wing political opponents - while Mussolini's occupation army, fresh from its genocidal sweeps through Ethiopia and Libya, is presented as a collection of harmless, fun-loving rogues. By contrast, the main Greek resistance organisation, ELAS - which, according to the German army's own records, killed more than 8,000 German soldiers in little over a year, tied down tens of thousands more and controlled 80% of the country when Hitler withdrew - is depicted as a gang of torturers, ignorant demagogues and cowards, who spent the war \"doing absolutely nothing\" except stealing food from peasants and murdering guerillas from smaller rival, British-backed resistance groups. Of the three communist characters in the novel, Hector is a sadistic monster, Mandras a rapist and Kokolios a penitent who swiftly abandons his political foolishness before being shot by his former comrades. Greece was the only country liberated from the Nazis where British troops fought the resistance - second only in scale to Tito's partisan movement in Yugoslavia - to impose a pro-western authoritarian regime after the German withdrawal. In a policy that was bitterly attacked across the political spectrum in Britain, Churchill ordered General Scobie, in December 1944, to behave in Athens \"as if you were in a conquered city\". While de Berni\u00e8res claims in the novel that ELAS and its million-strong political umbrella group, EAM, lorded it over the population in Cephalonia and elsewhere as Greece plunged into civil war, he is silent about the white terror that followed the British occupation, or the incorporation of the Nazis' detested Greek collaborators into the new order, or the mass internment, exile and killing of tens of thousands of left-wing activists. And nowhere is there any reflection of the flowering of self-government in the areas liberated by the resistance, of the fact that women were given the vote for the first time in Greek history - or of the part played by ELAS in rescuing Greek Jews from transportation to the Nazi death camps. Until the 70s, it was still a crime in Greece to have fought against the Nazis in the main wartime resistance movement, while Nazi collaborators received pensions. The role of the ELAS \"andartes\", or guerillas, in the liberation was formally recognised by the state only under Andreas Papandreou in the 80s. But, in case any reader might have mistaken his own view, de Berni\u00e8res included an author's note in earlier editions of Captain Corelli's Mandolin to berate \"disconnected intellectuals\" for regarding the Greek communists as \"romantic heroes\", adding, \"when they were not totally useless, perfidious and parasitic, they were unspeakably barbaric\". Makis Faraklos, now the 76-year-old president of the resistance veterans' association in the Cephalonian town of Lixouri, remembers witnessing the fate of some of those whom de Berni\u00e8res insists spent the German occupation doing nothing. \"On June 5, 1944, the Germans hanged five resistance members in the main square because the andartes had killed a collaborator. They forced everyone they found on the streets to go there and set up four machine guns around us. One of the five, Dionisis Ratsiatos, was my teacher - I loved that man. There was a father and son, Gavrilis and Vasilis Rallatos, and the father was forced to watch his son hanged twice, because the rope broke the first time they strung him up. They hanged them from two trees. The youngest to die that day was Spiros Analitis, in his early 20s. The German commander announced through an interpreter that he would be freed if he gave information about the resistance. Analitis didn't reply, but called to the crowd, 'You, tyranny-fighting youth, will avenge our deaths.' \" There is a plaque marking the spot where the five hanged, as there are monuments all over the island commemorating resistance fighters killed during the occupation or the civil war. In Zervata, in the mountains above Sami, a bust of the legendary Cephalonian ELAS commander, Astrapioannos, is the centrepiece of a garden of remembrance to the fallen partisans. Further up the mountainside, surrounded by caves and now inhabited only by goats and wild dogs, lie the ruins of the village of Mouzakata, his wartime guerilla hide-out - first bombed by the Germans, later by government forces with British support during the civil war, and finally abandoned after Cephalonia's devastating 1953 earthquake. Another of de Berni\u00e8res's \"barbarians\" - Argostoli's retired theatre director, the 83-year-old opera-singing Spiros Fokas - keeps a pair of Wehrmacht jackboots by the bar in his hotel. They belonged, he explains, to a German soldier he shot in an ambush of two troop carriers on the road between Sami and Aghia Efimia. Fokas, who spent almost a year fighting with ELAS on the mainland during the war, had been sent back to Cephalonia with three other andartes as a scouting group in the last phase of the German occupation. He went on to take part in other attacks on German forces as they retreated from the island. For his pains, he was persecuted and imprisoned in the 50s and 60s, and his son, now a professor at Imperial College in London, was forced to study abroad. But of all de Berni\u00e8res's disparaging claims about the Cephalonian resistance, perhaps the most deeply resented by the island's veterans is his insistence that the movement refused to come to the aid of the Italians when they turned on their former German allies at such terrible cost in the autumn of 1943. It is \"certain\", the British soldier-turned-author declares in the novel, that the \"communist andartes of ELAS took no part, seeing no reason to shake themselves out of their parasitic lethargy\". Later, he even has the heroine, Pelagia, hearing that the partisans have been \"killing off\" Italians who came to fight alongside them against the Germans. From the islanders' point of view, no charge could be more wounding. The Italian-German confrontation and subsequent massacres were a defining moment of modern Cephalonian history. The only resistance force on the island was ELAS and its political wing, EAM, though neither organisation was exclusively, or even predominantly, communist. Both Greeks and Italian survivors testify that not only did the resistance give practical and armed support to the Italian troops, but 15 andartes lost their lives in the fighting. Far from killing Italians who escaped the German slaughter, the resistance - including the parents of Dionisis Georgatos, Cephalonia's present-day governor - hid them and helped spirit them off the island. Dimitrios Podimatas, a 78-year-old Cepha-lonian communist resistance veteran, remembers five of those who died in the Italian- German clashes of September 1943. \"A party of 12 people was picked from my village, Mousata, by the resistance and sent to fight the Germans in Omala near the monastery of St Gerasimos. I didn't go because I was sick at the time, but my brother went. The Germans intercepted the group at Dilinata on September 20 and shot five of them. One of those killed was my cousin, Gerasimos Podimatas. He lived in our house and was very popular in the village. To a small community like this, it was a disaster, a psychological trauma.\" The names of the five who met their deaths that day are recorded on a memorial. Podimatas - who between 1946 and 1971 spent a total of 17 years in prison or camps without trial for his political activity - weeps as he tells the story. Even Podimatas's record of persecution fails to match the experience of Vangelis Neochorotis, a 91-year-old Cephalonian veteran of both the resistance and the Greek-Italian war of 1940-1941, who spent 21 years in prison and whose brother was executed during the civil war. Both he and his brother, like thousands of others, refused an offer of release if they signed a statement renouncing communism. Sitting in the garden of the house in Paliki he has lived in since the 30s with his wife Amalia - herself a former EAM member who was tortured after the war - Neochorotis gives his view of the Corelli story: \"De Berni\u00e8res's book is an insult to the whole Greek people. But I believe it is also part of a global drive to rewrite history, to reverse historical facts, to convince people that political and social change is a dead end and that if you struggle for a better world, it only leads to bloodshed, suffering and failure.\" The backlash against Captain Corelli was a slow-burn affair. When the novel was first translated into Greek, the communist paper, Rizospastis, accidentally gave it a glowing review, lifted in haste from a news agency. But by the time the film-makers came to recce the island two years ago, the campaign was already up and running, with angry letters in the Athens press and delegations to Cephalonia's political leaders. The Greek islands have traditionally been dominated by the left, and Cephalonia is no exception, with the communists still winning 12% of the vote and the combined left-of-centre parties scooping up more than 60%. One typical protest to the island's governor, from the local League of High School Teachers, thundered that de Berni\u00e8res's book \"distorts and slanders the Greek struggle during the occupation\" and proceeded to list, page by page, what it regarded as factual errors. The controversy first surfaced in Britain last year, when a mauling at the hands of the Morning Star finally aroused de Berni\u00e8res from his literary lair. Accused by Andrew Murray, former spin-doctor to the transport union leader Bill Morris, of writing a book of \"the most crude and brazen anti-communism\" and being an \"apologist for the excesses of the right in Greece\", the riled author made the mistake of lashing out. \"How long are you people going to sit in the dark in an air-pocket, wanking each other off?\" de Berni\u00e8res demanded to know in a reader's letter. \"Your ship has sunk, brothers,\" he declared, adding that he was \"delighted to receive a hostile notice from your paper\". \u0095 Read part two of Greek Myth here",

      "body": "<p>The book is an epitaph of a thing. POEMS 1960-2000, as though the poet is meant to be dead. Since she clearly is not, it must be more of a symbol of institutionalised acceptability, like an OBE. Exactly like that. One afternoon we had them both out, the book and the medal and gave them long shrift. She was saying something about liking the finality of it, the completion, sounding defiant and fatalistic at the same time, when the vicar's wife telephoned. Would she be an angel and read the lesson this upcoming Sunday instead of next? Yes, yes, of course she will. Sunday it is, then, lovely, and she laughed the girlish laugh of a particularly dependable monitoress. </p> <p>Meanwhile, I have inspected the picture on the cover. \"From a painting by Hans Holbein the Younger,\" it says, \"1497-1543 A Lady With A Squirrel And A Starling\": a solid female citizen with introspective gaze, hands folded piously around a chain that inches along her wrist and - good grief - enslaves the chubby squirrel to her bosom. Pure Adcockian shock tactic, I reckon, a sort of pictorial version of something wickedly sharp that suddenly leaps from the fastidious formality of rhyme and meter and bites you on the bum. </p> <p>You can see why they value her vocal contribution at the lectern. Adcock's voice is literally ethereal, so light and pure it seems to be emanating from altitude. In front of you is this pretty, faded tapestry of a woman, smiling hospitably and bringing tea and ashtrays, while what she's saying floods your auditory system as though she is also behind you. No, she says, we hardly ever see squirrels in East Finchley nowadays. Do you take sugar? They're not very nice, you know. They're carnivores. Didn't you know that? Oh, yes, they creep about in trees looking for birds' nests and when they find one they look over the nestlings and finger them out, one by one, and gobble them up. First they nibble off their tiny feet, then they scoff the lot. She has this on the eye-witness authority of a friend of the old gentleman who lives next door and devotes himself to trapping the little murderers and slaughtering them wholesale. First he tried stabbing, but that didn't work, so now he drowns them. That does the trick. </p> <p>Lilting on from the ether, she returns to the matter in hand. Ah, yes, her OBE, still in its box. She had, of course, toyed with the idea of turning it down on the grounds of the silly, school-prize-day elitism of the honours system. But then she thought if she did that she'd only go around telling everyone, which, perversely, would have a similarly unattractive effect. So she bought a hat and a smart suit which would afterwards do for funerals, and turned up at the palace for the big reward. Now she thinks back on it, it was all quite enthralling. You line up with a few hundred other worthies, long-serving town clerks and lollipop ladies and so forth, while a man sticks a hook thing into your brand new lapel and gives you the drill. Speak when you're spoken to, go when your time is up. Her Majesty will make it abundantly clear when that is. </p> <p>I have to stand up for this bit. You be me, she says, I'll be the Queen. Right. Her Majesty comes before you, so, another man with a clipboard tells her who you are, then she tells you who you are, loops the gong on your hook, takes your right hand in hers, so, tells you well done and, still holding your hand, gives you an almighty shove backwards. Like so. A serious shove. If you're not well braced on your pins you could do a purler. We give each other the royal shove of honour so as to be quite clear in our minds as to the precise toppling potential of Her Majesty's dismissal technique. </p> <p>There is no mockery intended. To Fleur Adcock, things are only what they are; sad or funny or painful or puzzling or silly or wonderful or any of a million, trillion things, none of which require to be tainted by judgmental inference. She exudes an air of serene pragmatism that punctuates itself with floaty giggles or helpless sighs rather than analysis or rationalisation. She is all of a piece, outside in, inside out. Small talk, life experience, the most bizarre machinations of her psyche are all the same to her. </p> <p>At our first meeting, she lead me into her unreconstructed scullery and talked about the charm of Victorian plumbing and the ludicrous inflation of real-estate values in north London. Then of the arrival, from New Zealand this morning, of her sister's autobiography, in which she has read a faintly dismaying account of herself in general and, in particular, her hands. This last triggers the memory of Tiger-Spider, the lost companion of last summer, who wove her wondrous web in the scullery cupboard. She was large and her legs were striped black and gold and hairy and, as she grew old and seemed to be failing, Fleur bought cos lettuces for their greenflies and blew them on her web to supplement her diet. One day, Tiger-Spider came out of her cupboard and was observed legging it across the ceiling, alarmingly close to where she might topple into the sink and perish. </p> <p>Fleur reached up, took Tiger-Spider into her hands and carried her home to safety. \"Don't you think it extraordinary?\" she said, \"to have been together for so long and never to have touched her before?\" And she looked at her hands, small and pale and sweetly cupped as when they cradled the late lamented arachnid. She sighed and winced. Her sister has written that, once upon a time, when they were both young, they compared hands and Fleur's were judged to be less pleasing. She is at a loss. There is no end to the vicissitudes of sibling rivalry. </p> <p>The point is, you don't get it at the time. Your heart is broken and you don't even know it. It's something you have to work out later. She knows the precise moment now, as we climb the stairs to her study, so it comes, all cheerfully matter-of-fact from between her shoulder blades. \"My heart was broken when my sister was born.\" And there on the landing she said that nobody really understands the visceral anguish of the first-born when the next one arrives. She was only 18 months old. Everything was perfect, then they kicked her in the teeth. Clearly it was because she wasn't good enough, so they went out and got themselves another one. A cuter one. You don't recover from that sort of betrayal. Sixty-two years it has taken her to work that out. After that, though, rejection is a piece of cake. You learn detachment. Even so, it's a bit much when you're supposed to be the big girl, protector of the little one, and you've just had the biggest shock of your life. </p> <p>She was five years old when the big test came. Her parents had come to England from New Zealand, where she was born. The second world war was on the cards and they, good people that they were, meant to dig ditches for the war effort. They settled briefly in Sidcup, then evacuated their daughters to distant relations on a Leicestershire farm. </p> <p>In England, Fleur found her spiritual home. Not to put too fine a point on it, she loved the weather. The seasons were real and distinct one from another. Winters were real winters with snow and summers were real summers and the skies changed face a million times a day and, putting it in a nutshell, there were primroses. In those first, halcyon days, she was a good big sister. Without a mummy and daddy to fight for, there was nothing to be cross about. Being the first to read, she did the decent thing and read aloud to the baby sister, good as gold. The worst she did was to charge a penny each for making up a new William story. \"William and Ginger went for a walk. Just as they came to the old barn, William noticed . . .\" And so on. She didn't get nasty till later. </p> <p>In common with most children of her computer-less generation, Fleur seemed to have been born with a sort of literacy racial memory. Looking back, she has to presume her parents taught her to read and write, since they were both teachers, but her abiding memory is of being able to discern the sound of written words before she had the vocabulary to comprehend their meaning. </p> <p>For instance, she'd be sitting on the bus, aged four, merrily reading \"Do not spit. Penalty \u00a35\" off the wall and wondering how you go about spitting penalty and in what way it differed from ordinary spit. She liked to make sense of things, she wanted things to fit and, if at all possible, to rhyme. She had a huge book of nursery rhymes, as thick as it was square, and her mother would recite grown-up poems to her; Drinkwater, Brooke, Monroe. \"Moonlit apples,\" she croons now. And \"I will lie in the grass and howl for them/Your green glass beads.\" Adcock wrote her first poem when she was five. The silvered voice delivers it now, with no less reverence than she'd attribute to Wordsworth: </p> <p>\"Hurry up and go to bed <br> For all night long you cuddle Ted.\" </p> <p>And points out, in fairness, that she didn't really have a teddy bear, she had a soft-toy dog called Bob, but since Bob doesn't rhyme with bed she made Ted up. Later, she added a further couplet to that first fine, careless rapture. </p> <p>\"We'll have good sleep all through the night <br> And when dawn comes we'll see the light.\" </p> <p>By the time she was seven and England's pastoral heritage had become her own, she blossomed with the following: </p> <p>\"The daffodils bloom at Easter-time <br> And violets and primroses too. <br> They cover the wood <br> In a beautiful hood <br> Mauve and yellow and blue.\" </p> <p>She was destined to become a scholar, mainly because doing her very best and passing examinations came easier to her than other childhood activities, like making lots of friends and hanging out with the in-crowd. Otherwise, she lived in books and a somewhat Blytonesque fantasy life in which she and the little sister dug imaginary tunnels in imaginary woods and founded imaginary communities where everyone ate what they pleased and went to boarding schools and made the teachers look silly. She read everything she could get her hands on. She even read a tome her father wrote, Fundamentals Of Psychology, or some fine thing, hoping to find something about sex in it and plodding instead through stultifying, Eisenckian disciplines and statistics and categorisings and measurings. </p> <p>He was what we'd now call something of an emotionally absent man, her dad. A strange and isolated sort of chap, he was passionate about world peace. Throughout Fleur's early childhood he roamed around Europe speaking Esperanto with his Esperantist chums, turning his attention to the conflicts of family life only in times of dire emergency. He wrote just the once to his older daughter, a letter urging her to cease bullying her sister on the grounds that it was not something Captain Scott would have done. It was the best he could do, unaware, as he was, that his hero had long since been eclipsed by Scarlet O'Hara in Fleur's scheme of things. </p> <p>She is a little hazy about the bullying. She once threw a fork, yes, and sometimes she'd just hit her. Well, she was irritating. Little sisters are. And when you're close, you do things. Like project your own horrors and dreads on to the nearest person. So, yes, she'd tell her spooky stories at night about ghosts and corpses and graves and frighten the life out of her. And - she can't believe she did this - she told her that her favourite doll, Pixie-Ann, had once been a little girl and she wasn't now because her father took a gun and shot her dead. Which was enough to put her off dolls and fathers and everything else. </p> <p>She remembers being 11 and going yet again to a new school. There were 13 of those, all told. \"Oh, we'll bring her out of herself,\" one headmistress promised, and Fleur looked at her powdered face and her warts and had her doubts. So here she was again, all alone in unfamiliar territory, where rather than hunch against a wall for the duration of morning break, displaying herself as a wretched isolate for the umpteenth time, she climbed to the top of a huge elm tree. It was, if you like, an exercise in ambivalence. On the one hand she was escaping, on the other she was courting attention. And, of course, they all gathered round. Who is that daring, interesting girl? See how fearless she is, let us climb up and join her. Some of them did just that, got stuck and had to be helped down. So it worked. Up a tree she was a fascinating figure; down to earth a bit of a disappointment. \"Why do I write?\" she says. \"It's the same thing, isn't it? See me! Out on a limb.\" </p> <p>They took her back to New Zealand after the war. The long journey home probably marked the end and the culmination of her childhood. She and the little sister strung up curtains in one of the ship's nether corridors and put on entertainment for the other children. They wrote and performed a series of what they took to be hilarious plays centred on a Mr Tommy Ato and his wife Poppette who ran a hat shop. Tommy Ah-to. Tomato. She was 13. The series ran and ran. The children paid up. England got further and further away till all she had left was an abiding sense of loss and a bad case of homesickness. </p> <p>Five years later, she was sitting her finals at Wellington University, pregnant, married, a shit-hot Latin scholar and fondly imagining she was grown up. She had seen her husband across a crowded room and snapped him up for his physical beauty. He looked like Gregory Peck only better, not as tall, alas, but divine. Exotic. Half Polynesian. If she was obliged to live in Kiwi-land, she might as well have the benefit. She fancied him \"like mad\". He was a romantic poet, published, acclaimed, successful, all the things she wanted for herself. She wanted, yes, to be him. Instead, she married him. It was a long time ago. \"Look,\" she says, \"nobody took you seriously in the 50s unless you had a bloke or were married or something. You couldn't get away from home, you couldn't shack up because that was immoral. You weren't anyone. All the things Sylvia Plath suffered from.\" </p> <p>So suddenly there she was with a little house and a little mortgage, pushing a pram along the street where Katherine Mansfield lived, desperately pretending to be grown up. She had her poet, but he had a wife. There was no more dressing up and going out having a good time. She was a suburban housewife, bored out of her mind. It was Catch 22. You couldn't be an adult without a man and you couldn't be an adult with a man. And when she thought about it properly she realised she didn't really want to be him anyway. She wrote a poem at that time, called The Lover. \"Always he would inhabit an alien landscape,\" it went, so everybody thought it was about the poet hubbie. But it wasn't. It was about herself, only in those days you weren't allowed to have female personas in poems. </p> <p>The marriage lasted five years. Somewhere along the way she got caught in flagrante with someone else, was as guilty as sin, had a second son, dwelt peaceably \u00e0 trois with the romantic poet's second wife for a spell, got a job and took off with her baby under her arm. </p> <p> She can't believe she did this. How to put it? She was a child, 23 going on 12. She'd been brought up to believe fair was fair; a cake for her, the identical cake for her sister. There was nothing for it but to leave her first-born with his father. It seemed fair. It was that bone-simple. She felt she had no more choice than if her child had been snatched or had died. He would have the same parent, the same home, the same bed, the same little tricycle, just a different mother. </p> <p>\"I just don't recognise the girl who did this,\" she says, her voice dropping like a stone. \"I haven't a clue how her mind worked. This is me sitting here now, I've grown cynical and I don't know who she is. Only in bits. Her past and her memories I can see, but I don't recognise her in the mirror and I don't like looking back on her. I don't admire her.\" And, more in sorrow than anger, she concludes that she is jolly glad to have got away from someone so, so . . . so pathetic. </p> <p>At 23, then, with one small baby and a university lectureship to bless herself with, she began to muddle through a facsimile of an independent life. The city of Dunedin, where she worked, was \"all lace curtains and Calvinistic disapproval,\" and a divorced woman was ostracised in respectable company. The poems she wrote in those days, she thinks now, seem to have been written by someone pretending to be her. She had no idea how unhappy she was until one day she found herself standing by the wall in her kitchen, waiting for the kettle to boil, with unstoppable tears pouring down her face. The enormity of it all hit her like a hammer. She had relinquished her child, and all the rationalisation in the world wouldn't make it right. It was all wrong. Everything. Hopelessly wrong. Her love affairs brought torment and obsession and guilt and going back to wives and attempted suicides and God knows what-all. Romantic idylls of the kind you imagine will continue in heaven have a tendency to be played out with married men or those separated from you by great distances. They work rather as an antidote to domestic enslavement but are invariably full of grief. </p> <p>The citizens of Dunedin, by this token, were probably right about young Fleur. Well- meaning friends, perceiving her anguish, introduced her to various distractions, among them a gentleman by the name of Barry Crump. \"But don't marry him,\" they counselled urgently, which was a mistake. </p> <p>Among his many distinctions, Mr Crump was incredibly famous in New Zealand. Searching for a contemporary equivalent, Adcock thinks of Georgie Best. Or, better yet, Gazza. He was a Crocodile Dundee sort of fellow who wrote adventure stories with titles such as Hang On A Minute, Mate and A Good Keen Man. And, of course, he was an absolute knock-out in bed. \"Well, they are, aren't they?\" she says, giggling like a teenager. \"Male chauvinist pigs always are. Think of Italians. Isn't it perverse?\" </p> <p>Anyway, it wasn't long before she displayed all the foresight and prudence of a lemming and married him. It was, she says, the most horrifying thing she could think to do to persuade herself out of more obsessive liaisons. He was soon routinely smacking her in the mouth. \"They do that, don't they?\" she says. \"Manly men. They're fine in the pub telling jokes and stories, but in an argument they're not so good at the old logic, so that's when they smack you across the mouth.\" </p> <p>The marriage lasted five months. By way of a divorce settlement, Mr Crump agreed to pay her passage to England, less the \u00a330 she'd already salted away for the purpose. And she ran away. No. Correction. She ran towards. </p> <p>It was mid-winter when she arrived in London, as though the whole of England had been kept on ice for her, waiting for her to come home. Sylvia Plath had taken her life one week earlier. Nobody had heard of a poet called Fleur Adcock. She had a six-year-old son, a couple of tea chests and some loose change, but the frost was cruel and she was literally sparked by that. \"When it's frosty,\" she says, \"I feel as though I've been taking some interesting drug.\" </p> <p>Within months she had a pensionable post as a librarian with the Civil Service in the Colonial Office, which astoundingly respectable day-job sustained her for the next 15 years. That is to say it bought her a few hours of solitude each day to write in. </p> <p>She didn't need anything else. </p> <p> At 29, she knew she would not marry again. Her record in this regard was not auspicious. \"Five years,\" she says, \"then five months. What could I expect? Five weeks? Five minutes?\" For her, the difference between solitude, as in the need for tranquillity with which to entertain her muse, and solitude, as in where is everybody, were already fairly clear. Loneliness and solitude sometimes overlap, but only sometimes. Sometimes you long for the phone to ring or someone to knock on your door, but the feeling goes away if you allow it to. </p> <p>The truth is, she says, that she isn't really interested in relationships. Affairs, yes, relationships, no. \"People say you must work at a relationship. Well, I don't want to work at it. I don't want to sit down and discuss it, I just want to have it. Oh, God,\" she says, lapsing into giggles, \"Speak to me! Let us set aside time to hammer out our problems! Let us have Quality Time together!\" </p> <p>Clearly there are no conventional rules nailed to her masthead. \"You have to listen,\" she says, speaking of her development as a poet, \"to your own voice. Not your heart, not your instincts, not any of that self-permissive psycho-babble stuff. No, none of that. If it was just about instincts and bright ideas it wouldn't need to be a voice. It's about words. You hear them, read them, then you write. But mostly read. Read the bloody poems.\" </p> <p>Her poems are often born in the early morning or late at night when she is close enough to sleep to have an open line to her unconscious thought processes. \"The voice of inspiration, or whatever corny title you choose to give it, comes from that place. But it is also your own voice. And, on the whole, it speaks in colloquial language and uses proper grammar and syntax.\" And, not for the first or the last time, she insists, \"There's nothing airy-fairy about being a poet.\" </p> <p>\"Art,\" she declares, not at all portentously, \"is whatever you choose to frame.\" This is so neat it makes me laugh, but she is entirely earnest. She explains that she was judging something or other, a poetry competition, and found herself in an argument with Antonia Byatt. There was a poem she particularly liked; a verse, a tiny, tiny thing that touched her. What's so wonderful about it, Byatt wanted to know; any self-respecting novelist has this kind of thing on every page. Well, yes, replied Adcock, but this has got white space around it. It's separate and you look at it in isolation and not as part of a 200 page narrative, so it fulfils another function. It's a poem. </p> <p>Lately, she has consciously abandoned her muse, which is odd considering she has just written a new poem exploring the rift. Forty years spent skittering her small fingers across progressively lighter keyboards has landed her with a nasty dose of RSI, a notoriously depressing ailment. It prevents her from driving and mowing her lawn and opening screw-top jars, but does not seem to have stopped her being up to her elbows in a hefty work of prose. For the past several years she has been drawn deeper and deeper through tunnels of her own genealogy, partly as a homage to English history, partly as a love affair she is conducting with her ancestors. </p> <p>Goodness only knows who'd be interested, she says, but it has been entirely enthralling to sleuth her way around the country leafing out the branches of her family tree with stark information from parish registers and graveyards and tombstones. There have been few thrills in her life to equal that of personally, physically wrenching undergrowth from a 17th-century grave and knowing that the bones of a forebear are personally, physically there, just below the stone. Or of discovering in an ancient register that a male ancestor had been buried on the same day that his illegitimate daughter was christened. What happened? He was married, the mother of the child was a widow. These things are easy to check. Did someone kill him? Did the widow wait till he was dead before she outed her shameful bundle? There is no end to the goings-on, the intrigue and coincidence. It has her quite hooked, like a soap-opera. </p> <p>\"The thing about one's ancestry,\" she says in the intense whisper she reserves for matters of particularly compelling intimacy, \"is it's really about sex. These people made us. It's about sex and the way you want to touch people, like wanting to pat your grandchildren on their heads. Ancestors and poetry and religion are the same. All about wonder. Having a sense of wonder.\" </p> <p>Fleur Adcock has entitled her latest poem The Ex-Poet.

      "bodyText": "The book is an epitaph of a thing. POEMS 1960-2000, as though the poet is meant to be dead. Since she clearly is not, it must be more of a symbol of institutionalised acceptability, like an OBE. Exactly like that. One afternoon we had them both out, the book and the medal and gave them long shrift. She was saying something about liking the finality of it, the completion, sounding defiant and fatalistic at the same time, when the vicar's wife telephoned. Would she be an angel and read the lesson this upcoming Sunday instead of next? Yes, yes, of course she will. Sunday it is, then, lovely, and she laughed the girlish laugh of a particularly dependable monitoress. Meanwhile, I have inspected the picture on the cover. \"From a painting by Hans Holbein the Younger,\" it says, \"1497-1543 A Lady With A Squirrel And A Starling\": a solid female citizen with introspective gaze, hands folded piously around a chain that inches along her wrist and - good grief - enslaves the chubby squirrel to her bosom. Pure Adcockian shock tactic, I reckon, a sort of pictorial version of something wickedly sharp that suddenly leaps from the fastidious formality of rhyme and meter and bites you on the bum. You can see why they value her vocal contribution at the lectern. Adcock's voice is literally ethereal, so light and pure it seems to be emanating from altitude. In front of you is this pretty, faded tapestry of a woman, smiling hospitably and bringing tea and ashtrays, while what she's saying floods your auditory system as though she is also behind you. No, she says, we hardly ever see squirrels in East Finchley nowadays. Do you take sugar? They're not very nice, you know. They're carnivores. Didn't you know that? Oh, yes, they creep about in trees looking for birds' nests and when they find one they look over the nestlings and finger them out, one by one, and gobble them up. First they nibble off their tiny feet, then they scoff the lot. She has this on the eye-witness authority of a friend of the old gentleman who lives next door and devotes himself to trapping the little murderers and slaughtering them wholesale. First he tried stabbing, but that didn't work, so now he drowns them. That does the trick. Lilting on from the ether, she returns to the matter in hand. Ah, yes, her OBE, still in its box. She had, of course, toyed with the idea of turning it down on the grounds of the silly, school-prize-day elitism of the honours system. But then she thought if she did that she'd only go around telling everyone, which, perversely, would have a similarly unattractive effect. So she bought a hat and a smart suit which would afterwards do for funerals, and turned up at the palace for the big reward. Now she thinks back on it, it was all quite enthralling. You line up with a few hundred other worthies, long-serving town clerks and lollipop ladies and so forth, while a man sticks a hook thing into your brand new lapel and gives you the drill. Speak when you're spoken to, go when your time is up. Her Majesty will make it abundantly clear when that is. I have to stand up for this bit. You be me, she says, I'll be the Queen. Right. Her Majesty comes before you, so, another man with a clipboard tells her who you are, then she tells you who you are, loops the gong on your hook, takes your right hand in hers, so, tells you well done and, still holding your hand, gives you an almighty shove backwards. Like so. A serious shove. If you're not well braced on your pins you could do a purler. We give each other the royal shove of honour so as to be quite clear in our minds as to the precise toppling potential of Her Majesty's dismissal technique. There is no mockery intended. To Fleur Adcock, things are only what they are; sad or funny or painful or puzzling or silly or wonderful or any of a million, trillion things, none of which require to be tainted by judgmental inference. She exudes an air of serene pragmatism that punctuates itself with floaty giggles or helpless sighs rather than analysis or rationalisation. She is all of a piece, outside in, inside out. Small talk, life experience, the most bizarre machinations of her psyche are all the same to her. At our first meeting, she lead me into her unreconstructed scullery and talked about the charm of Victorian plumbing and the ludicrous inflation of real-estate values in north London. Then of the arrival, from New Zealand this morning, of her sister's autobiography, in which she has read a faintly dismaying account of herself in general and, in particular, her hands. This last triggers the memory of Tiger-Spider, the lost companion of last summer, who wove her wondrous web in the scullery cupboard. She was large and her legs were striped black and gold and hairy and, as she grew old and seemed to be failing, Fleur bought cos lettuces for their greenflies and blew them on her web to supplement her diet. One day, Tiger-Spider came out of her cupboard and was observed legging it across the ceiling, alarmingly close to where she might topple into the sink and perish. Fleur reached up, took Tiger-Spider into her hands and carried her home to safety. \"Don't you think it extraordinary?\" she said, \"to have been together for so long and never to have touched her before?\" And she looked at her hands, small and pale and sweetly cupped as when they cradled the late lamented arachnid. She sighed and winced. Her sister has written that, once upon a time, when they were both young, they compared hands and Fleur's were judged to be less pleasing. She is at a loss. There is no end to the vicissitudes of sibling rivalry. The point is, you don't get it at the time. Your heart is broken and you don't even know it. It's something you have to work out later. She knows the precise moment now, as we climb the stairs to her study, so it comes, all cheerfully matter-of-fact from between her shoulder blades. \"My heart was broken when my sister was born.\" And there on the landing she said that nobody really understands the visceral anguish of the first-born when the next one arrives. She was only 18 months old. Everything was perfect, then they kicked her in the teeth. Clearly it was because she wasn't good enough, so they went out and got themselves another one. A cuter one. You don't recover from that sort of betrayal. Sixty-two years it has taken her to work that out. After that, though, rejection is a piece of cake. You learn detachment. Even so, it's a bit much when you're supposed to be the big girl, protector of the little one, and you've just had the biggest shock of your life. She was five years old when the big test came. Her parents had come to England from New Zealand, where she was born. The second world war was on the cards and they, good people that they were, meant to dig ditches for the war effort. They settled briefly in Sidcup, then evacuated their daughters to distant relations on a Leicestershire farm. In England, Fleur found her spiritual home. Not to put too fine a point on it, she loved the weather. The seasons were real and distinct one from another. Winters were real winters with snow and summers were real summers and the skies changed face a million times a day and, putting it in a nutshell, there were primroses. In those first, halcyon days, she was a good big sister. Without a mummy and daddy to fight for, there was nothing to be cross about. Being the first to read, she did the decent thing and read aloud to the baby sister, good as gold. The worst she did was to charge a penny each for making up a new William story. \"William and Ginger went for a walk. Just as they came to the old barn, William noticed . . .\" And so on. She didn't get nasty till later. In common with most children of her computer-less generation, Fleur seemed to have been born with a sort of literacy racial memory. Looking back, she has to presume her parents taught her to read and write, since they were both teachers, but her abiding memory is of being able to discern the sound of written words before she had the vocabulary to comprehend their meaning. For instance, she'd be sitting on the bus, aged four, merrily reading \"Do not spit. Penalty \u00a35\" off the wall and wondering how you go about spitting penalty and in what way it differed from ordinary spit. She liked to make sense of things, she wanted things to fit and, if at all possible, to rhyme. She had a huge book of nursery rhymes, as thick as it was square, and her mother would recite grown-up poems to her; Drinkwater, Brooke, Monroe. \"Moonlit apples,\" she croons now. And \"I will lie in the grass and howl for them/Your green glass beads.\" Adcock wrote her first poem when she was five. The silvered voice delivers it now, with no less reverence than she'd attribute to Wordsworth: \"Hurry up and go to bed For all night long you cuddle Ted.\" And points out, in fairness, that she didn't really have a teddy bear, she had a soft-toy dog called Bob, but since Bob doesn't rhyme with bed she made Ted up. Later, she added a further couplet to that first fine, careless rapture. \"We'll have good sleep all through the night And when dawn comes we'll see the light.\" By the time she was seven and England's pastoral heritage had become her own, she blossomed with the following: \"The daffodils bloom at Easter-time And violets and primroses too. They cover the wood In a beautiful hood Mauve and yellow and blue.\" She was destined to become a scholar, mainly because doing her very best and passing examinations came easier to her than other childhood activities, like making lots of friends and hanging out with the in-crowd. Otherwise, she lived in books and a somewhat Blytonesque fantasy life in which she and the little sister dug imaginary tunnels in imaginary woods and founded imaginary communities where everyone ate what they pleased and went to boarding schools and made the teachers look silly. She read everything she could get her hands on. She even read a tome her father wrote, Fundamentals Of Psychology, or some fine thing, hoping to find something about sex in it and plodding instead through stultifying, Eisenckian disciplines and statistics and categorisings and measurings. He was what we'd now call something of an emotionally absent man, her dad. A strange and isolated sort of chap, he was passionate about world peace. Throughout Fleur's early childhood he roamed around Europe speaking Esperanto with his Esperantist chums, turning his attention to the conflicts of family life only in times of dire emergency. He wrote just the once to his older daughter, a letter urging her to cease bullying her sister on the grounds that it was not something Captain Scott would have done. It was the best he could do, unaware, as he was, that his hero had long since been eclipsed by Scarlet O'Hara in Fleur's scheme of things. She is a little hazy about the bullying. She once threw a fork, yes, and sometimes she'd just hit her. Well, she was irritating. Little sisters are. And when you're close, you do things. Like project your own horrors and dreads on to the nearest person. So, yes, she'd tell her spooky stories at night about ghosts and corpses and graves and frighten the life out of her. And - she can't believe she did this - she told her that her favourite doll, Pixie-Ann, had once been a little girl and she wasn't now because her father took a gun and shot her dead. Which was enough to put her off dolls and fathers and everything else. She remembers being 11 and going yet again to a new school. There were 13 of those, all told. \"Oh, we'll bring her out of herself,\" one headmistress promised, and Fleur looked at her powdered face and her warts and had her doubts. So here she was again, all alone in unfamiliar territory, where rather than hunch against a wall for the duration of morning break, displaying herself as a wretched isolate for the umpteenth time, she climbed to the top of a huge elm tree. It was, if you like, an exercise in ambivalence. On the one hand she was escaping, on the other she was courting attention. And, of course, they all gathered round. Who is that daring, interesting girl? See how fearless she is, let us climb up and join her. Some of them did just that, got stuck and had to be helped down. So it worked. Up a tree she was a fascinating figure; down to earth a bit of a disappointment. \"Why do I write?\" she says. \"It's the same thing, isn't it? See me! Out on a limb.\" They took her back to New Zealand after the war. The long journey home probably marked the end and the culmination of her childhood. She and the little sister strung up curtains in one of the ship's nether corridors and put on entertainment for the other children. They wrote and performed a series of what they took to be hilarious plays centred on a Mr Tommy Ato and his wife Poppette who ran a hat shop. Tommy Ah-to. Tomato. She was 13. The series ran and ran. The children paid up. England got further and further away till all she had left was an abiding sense of loss and a bad case of homesickness. Five years later, she was sitting her finals at Wellington University, pregnant, married, a shit-hot Latin scholar and fondly imagining she was grown up. She had seen her husband across a crowded room and snapped him up for his physical beauty. He looked like Gregory Peck only better, not as tall, alas, but divine. Exotic. Half Polynesian. If she was obliged to live in Kiwi-land, she might as well have the benefit. She fancied him \"like mad\". He was a romantic poet, published, acclaimed, successful, all the things she wanted for herself. She wanted, yes, to be him. Instead, she married him. It was a long time ago. \"Look,\" she says, \"nobody took you seriously in the 50s unless you had a bloke or were married or something. You couldn't get away from home, you couldn't shack up because that was immoral. You weren't anyone. All the things Sylvia Plath suffered from.\" So suddenly there she was with a little house and a little mortgage, pushing a pram along the street where Katherine Mansfield lived, desperately pretending to be grown up.

By way of a divorce settlement, Mr Crump agreed to pay her passage to England, less the \u00a330 she'd already salted away for the purpose. And she ran away. No. Correction. She ran towards. It was mid-winter when she arrived in London, as though the whole of England had been kept on ice for her, waiting for her to come home. Sylvia Plath had taken her life one week earlier. Nobody had heard of a poet called Fleur Adcock. She had a six-year-old son, a couple of tea chests and some loose change, but the frost was cruel and she was literally sparked by that. \"When it's frosty,\" she says, \"I feel as though I've been taking some interesting drug.\" Within months she had a pensionable post as a librarian with the Civil Service in the Colonial Office, which astoundingly respectable day-job sustained her for the next 15 years. That is to say it bought her a few hours of solitude each day to write in. She didn't need anything else. At 29, she knew she would not marry again. Her record in this regard was not auspicious. \"Five years,\" she says, \"then five months. What could I expect? Five weeks? Five minutes?\" For her, the difference between solitude, as in the need for tranquillity with which to entertain her muse, and solitude, as in where is everybody, were already fairly clear. Loneliness and solitude sometimes overlap, but only sometimes. Sometimes you long for the phone to ring or someone to knock on your door, but the feeling goes away if you allow it to. The truth is, she says, that she isn't really interested in relationships. Affairs, yes, relationships, no. \"People say you must work at a relationship. Well, I don't want to work at it. I don't want to sit down and discuss it, I just want to have it. Oh, God,\" she says, lapsing into giggles, \"Speak to me! Let us set aside time to hammer out our problems! Let us have Quality Time together!\" Clearly there are no conventional rules nailed to her masthead. \"You have to listen,\" she says, speaking of her development as a poet, \"to your own voice. Not your heart, not your instincts, not any of that self-permissive psycho-babble stuff. No, none of that. If it was just about instincts and bright ideas it wouldn't need to be a voice. It's about words. You hear them, read them, then you write. But mostly read. Read the bloody poems.\" Her poems are often born in the early morning or late at night when she is close enough to sleep to have an open line to her unconscious thought processes. \"The voice of inspiration, or whatever corny title you choose to give it, comes from that place. But it is also your own voice. And, on the whole, it speaks in colloquial language and uses proper grammar and syntax.\" And, not for the first or the last time, she insists, \"There's nothing airy-fairy about being a poet.\" \"Art,\" she declares, not at all portentously, \"is whatever you choose to frame.\" This is so neat it makes me laugh, but she is entirely earnest. She explains that she was judging something or other, a poetry competition, and found herself in an argument with Antonia Byatt. There was a poem she particularly liked; a verse, a tiny, tiny thing that touched her. What's so wonderful about it, Byatt wanted to know; any self-respecting novelist has this kind of thing on every page. Well, yes, replied Adcock, but this has got white space around it. It's separate and you look at it in isolation and not as part of a 200 page narrative, so it fulfils another function. It's a poem. Lately, she has consciously abandoned her muse, which is odd considering she has just written a new poem exploring the rift. Forty years spent skittering her small fingers across progressively lighter keyboards has landed her with a nasty dose of RSI, a notoriously depressing ailment. It prevents her from driving and mowing her lawn and opening screw-top jars, but does not seem to have stopped her being up to her elbows in a hefty work of prose. For the past several years she has been drawn deeper and deeper through tunnels of her own genealogy, partly as a homage to English history, partly as a love affair she is conducting with her ancestors. Goodness only knows who'd be interested, she says, but it has been entirely enthralling to sleuth her way around the country leafing out the branches of her family tree with stark information from parish registers and graveyards and tombstones. There have been few thrills in her life to equal that of personally, physically wrenching undergrowth from a 17th-century grave and knowing that the bones of a forebear are personally, physically there, just below the stone. Or of discovering in an ancient register that a male ancestor had been buried on the same day that his illegitimate daughter was christened. What happened? He was married, the mother of the child was a widow. These things are easy to check. Did someone kill him? Did the widow wait till he was dead before she outed her shameful bundle? There is no end to the goings-on, the intrigue and coincidence. It has her quite hooked, like a soap-opera. \"The thing about one's ancestry,\" she says in the intense whisper she reserves for matters of particularly compelling intimacy, \"is it's really about sex. These people made us. It's about sex and the way you want to touch people, like wanting to pat your grandchildren on their heads. Ancestors and poetry and religion are the same. All about wonder. Having a sense of wonder.\" Fleur Adcock has entitled her latest poem The Ex-Poet. I don't believe a word of it \u0095 POEMS 1960-2000, by Fleur Adcock, is published by Bloodaxe Books, priced \u00a310.95.",

      "body": "<p>There is a scene in Bridget Jones's Diary when Bridget unexpectedly finds herself standing in front of Julian Barnes at a literary party. Ms Jones, paralysed by Barnes's intimidating reputation for cool intelligence and languid wit, is struck dumb. The agonising silence is eventually broken when, to her own horror, she blurts out, \"Do you know where the toilets are?\" The resulting \"faint smile that hovered over his thin-but-attractive lips\" ensured her humiliation was made complete. </p> <p>The scene has been included in the film version of the diary which is currently in production in London. Although lots of real writers were gathered together by the producers to act as up-market extras, it was thought Barnes wasn't quite recognisable enough to a cinema-going audience to justify Bridget's level of mortification. So while Barnes stands around holding a glass of warm white wine and muttering \"rhubarb\", Salman Rushdie was parachuted in to precipitate the social catastrophe. </p> <p>When Barnes tells this story, he goes through the motions of huffing and puffing at the lack of respect shown to him and the cavalier attitude to the text adopted by superficial film-makers. But far from complaining that he is not famous enough, in reality one senses that Barnes feels he has more than enough fame, meaning in this case celebrity, already. He might be adamant that he is not an autobiographical writer, but when the narrator of his novel Flaubert's Parrot at one point asks, \"Why does the writing make us chase the writer? Why aren't the books enough?\" there is little doubt that he speaks for Barnes. </p> <p>None of this is to say he doesn't expect and appreciate the attention he gets as a front-rank journalist, essayist and most notably novelist. He is a wonderful prose stylist who has heeded Flaubert's dictum that words, like hair, \"shine with combing\". His work is both crowded with ideas and is emotionally acute as he dissects with a coldly knowing eye the way we live and, most of all, the way we love. In so doing Barnes has also pulled off the rare trick of producing work that is not only popular - it was as far back as 1996 that he sold his millionth paperback in Britain - but critically acclaimed. Graham Greene said Flaubert's Parrot was, \"intricate and delightful\". Nobel laureate Nadine Gordimer called his novel A History Of The World In 10\u20ac Chapters \"funny, ironic, erudite, surprising and not afraid to take a dive overboard into the depths of sorrow and loss\". Carlos Fuentes \"saluted\" him from Mexico, praising his work for being \"at the forefront of a new internationalisation of British fiction\". </p> <p>But the by-product of this success has meant his life has been periodically dragged into public view. \"In America, where all tendencies are admittedly exaggerated,\" he says, \"you have to make the decision immediately whether to go down the route of Mailer or Vidal or go down the reclusive route of Salinger or Pynchon. Both of which seem to me to lead to madness. It's not quite that bad over here but the question does remain.\" </p> <p>When the high-profile rift between Barnes and his former friend Martin Amis was recently rehashed in Amis's memoirs, Barnes maintained a characteristically scrupulous public silence. The row was precipitated when Amis changed literary agents in 1994. The agent he left was Pat Kavanagh, who is not only Barnes's agent but also his wife. Barnes still won't discuss the issue but says the closest he came to joining in the fray came when he read a letter to this newspaper following the serialisation of the memoirs. \"So, a bloke who writes books fell out with another bloke who writes books,\" observed the correspondent. \"Then they swore at each other. Can someone explain to me why this is worthy of my attention in an already crowded day?\" </p> <p>\"I thought, 'Yes!' when I read that letter,\" says Barnes. \"That's absolutely right. I nearly wrote to that man saying 'I'm with you on this one.' It seems that no sooner do you publish a book than everything from your bank account to your sex life become subjects about which the public have a right to know. I began to think that this wasn't in my book contract. I don't remember agreeing to all this.\" </p> <p>One source of aggravation for Barnes has been press fascination with an old affair between Pat Kavanagh and the novelist Jeanette Winterson. In fact, people close to the couple speak of their marriage as being particularly harmonious. \"They are actually a rather decorous couple,\" says one friend. \"They really have terrific complicity and an extraordinary closeness,\" says another. Yet such complications, added to the speculation that they appear as characters in other people's fiction, encourage the thought that Barnes must somehow be drawing on his own experiences. </p> <p>\"But I make things up,\" he protests. \"After my first book [Metroland] I have not been an autobiographical writer. Martin in Experience was saying that fiction is the higher autobiography. I just don't agree. My novels divide into what are called novels of ideas and novels of the personal life. It is tempting, but ultimately fallacious, to think that they are about my personal life. It is observation and imagination. There is nothing easier to make up than a convincing private life. Much easier to make up a sexual life than a financial life.\" </p> <p>Hermione Lee, as a friend and a biographer, has an ongoing debate with Barnes about the impact of the life on literary work. \"He dislikes the travesty version of a life that gets into the public domain when you are gossiped about, which is not unlike the things he resents about bad biography. Someone like Philip Roth is clearly writing his own life over and over again. It is completely different with Julian. Obviously he writes from his own state and habit of mind. His love of France is there and his visit to eastern Europe went into his novel set in eastern Europe, The Porcupine. But he's not writing novels about himself.\" </p> <p>Lee thinks this tendency to collapse the novels back into the life is particularly ironic in Barnes's case because he is so interested in \"imagining things and making them up and displacing himself into other characters and histories. Of course, he draws on his own emotions, but there is a difference between drawing on one's own life and writing autobiographical fic tion. He is terribly interested in people's relationships and what happens to love and friendship.\" </p> <p>His new novel, Love, Etc, carries on the story started in 1991 in Talking It Over in which Oliver, Stuart and Gillian talk straight to reader about their intense and funny love triangle. In the new book we meet them 10 years on. Barnes was once asked in a newspaper questionnaire what novels should have a sequel. \"None\" was his response, which begs the question. \"Fair cop,\" he says. \"I do generally believe that.\" But he was attracted back to the work because Talking It Over is the only book of his that people ask what happened to the characters afterwards. He also liked the idea of the characters speaking directly to the reader again. \"The membrane between the character and the reader is minimised.\" </p> <p>Love, Etc is a much darker book than Talking It Over. Through its minute choreography it unfolds the very Barnesian theme of what happens to love in a deeply mercantile society. \"I believe that the personal life is impinged on and has principles laid down by the general tenor and values of society,\" he says. \"It can't not. When societies were primarily religious, what love was and what it was for were different. What people wanted in 13th-century France was salvation, and beyond that economic and social position. Love as we think of it was an add-on. Then, with the decline of religion and the rise of romantic individualism, love came to be assumed not only to be the ultimate good but something that was somehow untainted. But it never is untainted, although it sometimes fools us that it is.\" </p> <p>\"It is interesting that he meditates on love to such an extent,\" says his friend, the writer Marina Warner. \"I don't know many novelists now who try to get to grips with it. How does one love well? How does one love so that one doesn't destroy or possess or inhibit?\" She also says how wounding it has been to him to have his privacy violated. \"But he is part of a group that seems to exercise remarkable powers of attraction.\" </p> <p>In the mid-70s, writers such as Amis and Ian McEwan began to impinge themselves on the public consciousness. Barnes, although a slightly later developer than his friends, was part of a group that not only had great talent but were soon exercising considerable clout in the book world. Indeed it seemed for many years that the only literary issue that mattered was whether Barnes, McEwan or Amis would ever win the Booker. </p> <p>Martin Amis might have been born into this trade and been name-dropping since he first said \"dad\". But it was all new to Barnes. The only member of his family who had ever had anything published was his mother, who once wrote a letter to the Evening Standard. \"She complained about girl students getting themselves pregnant and then expecting the state to look after them,\" he recalls. </p> <p>Barnes says that even when he was a student at Oxford the idea of being a writer was simply something that seemed off the radar. \"It was partly because I thought that art and literature were the supreme that I didn't think I could do it,\" he explains. \"I used to go to the English society and examine famous writers like Robert Graves and Stephen Spender who came to speak. I thought it must be wonderful to be a writer. But it was what other people did.\" </p> <p>That is not to say that Barnes had no expectation of achievement. His parents, both French teachers, \"weren't pushy in the sense that the fathers of girl tennis prodigies are pushy,\" he says, \"but it was assumed everything would work out all right. There was no specific career advice as there was no sex advice.\" </p> <p>Barnes was born in Leicester in 1946 but the family moved to suburban West London six weeks later. His one older brother is now a professor of philosophy working in Geneva. His childhood provided the location for his debut novel Metroland - \"J'habite metroland\" cynically proclaimed the young protagonist - as well as an intuitive understanding of the mores of a certain sort of middle-class English life. He didn't actually rebel against his upbringing but remembers living though a \"furious and puzzled boredom. It was waiting for life to happen and fearing that it would not.\" </p> <p>He went to City of London School, which entailed an hour and a quarter each way on the train and six hours of \"quite intense\" contact with other boys in between. Barnes played rugby and cricket, and won a scholarship to Oxford. He says the family response to this achievement was typical. \"I got home from school and a letter was waiting for me. I opened it up and said, 'I got a scholarship.' My mother said, 'Yes, I thought it was that.' It was a classic dampening down. Let's not get too excited.\" </p> <p>Outside of school, life was lived almost exclusively within the family unit and he says both he and his brother suffered a \"phobic reaction\" to this orthodoxy. \"After my brother went to university he virtually never came home again,\" he says. \"He would stay up over vacations and things like that. I was fairly estranged from my parents but did become closer to them in their later years. I was always very fond of my father, but my mother was a woman who I had to get away from for long periods.\" </p> <p>His brother Jonathan casually mentions that he has not seen Julian for \"a few years. We were chums when we were boys and I do always watch him when he is on French television. But we were never a close-knit family, thank God. We always thought that water was thicker than blood.\" </p> <p>Despite the distance between them, Jonathan Barnes says that his parents were proud of Julian's success and they had all his novels lined up on a shelf. \"My mother did say at one point that she couldn't read them because of the naughty bits,\" recalls Jonathan. \"But she must have read them to some degree to get to the naughty bits.\" </p> <p> Barnes's friends speak of an extraordinary loyalty and kindness, and he acknowledges that he may have constructed a family out of his friendships. \"The advantage of friends is that you choose them and they choose you. Instead of with a family where they are a given. I suppose I have pointless regrets for not coming from one of those large warm, extended, open families that exist in the mythology of the family. But I've very rarely seen one.\" </p> <p>Although he and Pat don't have children, he has four godchildren and enjoys being with his friends' children. His brother says he was very supportive and kind to his nieces when they were studying in London. \"He's the perfect uncle. I'm sure he would have been a very good father.\" In fact, his friend Jay McInerney has approvingly commented that the way the Barneses lead their life \"makes a great case for childlessness\". </p> <p>They have a beautiful house and garden in north London. Barnes is by all accounts an excellent cook and they regularly travel together for walking holidays. A habit of collecting first edition novels has now given way to collecting and drinking fine wine, and his friend, the wine writer Jancis Robinson says Barnes drinks better stuff than she does. Some people see this cultivation of the good things in life as slightly too meticulous. One observer characterised Barnes \"as the sort of person who washes his hands too often\", but Marina Warner says it is more \"a wise acceptance that his success means he can lead his life in an enriching way. He is a perfectionist with fantastic application.\" </p> <p>This meticulousness inevitably has a sharp side when confronted with the messiness of life, and Bridget Jones was probably right to display some apprehension. \"He has very high standards,\" says Jancis Robinson, \"by which I don't mean he worries whether or not the napkins are folded correctly. He wants everything to be good quality, whether that is a decision or a moral stance or a hunk of beef.\" Hermione Lee agrees that he can be very critical of \"some forms of behaviour: pretensions, sloppiness, showing off. You get on better with him if you behave well, which is different from behaving properly.\" </p> <p>It was all very different when Barnes went up to Oxford to study modern languages in 1964. He says he \"made a mess of the whole thing\", and failed to get the first which would have allowed him to follow his brother into postgraduate work. The swinging 60s \"partly\" happened to him: he bought the records - he is still a \"shameful\" owner of a boxed set of Donovan LPs - but the drugs passed him by. \"People spoke about things like big H and little H but you couldn't ask what they meant for fear of being uncool. I presume now it was heroin and hash.\" </p> <p>He also sidestepped the politics of the time. \"Other things seemed more interesting to me. The fact that I didn't understand one of Mallarm\u00e9's poems seemed more important than going to Grosvenor Square to protest against the Vietnam war.\" Today he devotes time to the fallout from politics and is a patron of Helen Bamber's Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture. He has arranged a series of fund- raising readings by writers including Jung Chang, Tom Stoppard, Ruth Rendell and Nick Hornby. \"Lots of people say they will help and then life overtakes and other commitments come along and they don't fulfil,\" says Bamber. \"But Julian, without any prompting, has kept this up year after year. It is hugely time consuming and he is really willing to put himself out.\" </p> <p>After Oxford, he did the civil service exams but instead of getting a position in the diplomatic service as he had hoped, he was offered a job as a tax inspector. \"It was humiliating and as I was rather snobbish I drew the line there.\" Instead, he signed on the dole for a while and then landed a job on the Oxford English Dictionary on the \"sports and dirty words section\". While there, he made his first contacts in the literary world. He met the poets Craig Raine and Christopher Reid and even had a book accepted for publication, although this was a false start. </p> <p>Barnes still has one copy of his Literary Guide To Oxford but says it is \"dreadful\". He had been paid an advance but after three years it had still not been published. \"So I wrote a firm but fair letter saying they should give me a date for publication and if they were not going to publish they should return the manuscript,\" he says. \"Never did a manuscript come back so quickly. And, worse, it had been copy-edited up to about page 60 by someone who obviously hated it and hadn't got any further.\" </p> <p>After three years, Barnes came to London to read for the bar. \"I was good at passing exams but I was deeply unsuited to standing up in court with a wig on my head and thinking on my feet as I was virtually mute at that time and very self-conscious. I remember when I worked at the New Statesman we had a messenger who delivered all the internal mail but none of the external messages. It turned out he was agoraphobic. I was a bit like him in that I chose the profession for which I was the least suited.\" </p> <p>However, the move in to the law gave him two years' breathing space in which he started writing book reviews. His first published piece was about the restoration of old buildings and was printed in the Times Educational Supplement. \"I was sharing a flat with an architectural historian at the time and I just used his knowledge.\" </p> <p>The architectural historian was Andrew Saint, now a professor at Cambridge, who recalls the time as one of \"drifting around in that semi-privileged post-Oxford languor\". He doesn't remember talking about books or about much else to Barnes, who he recalls as \"extremely taciturn. He really didn't speak very much at all. He had this slightly saturnine smile so you didn't really know what he was thinking. But having said that, when he did say something it was usually more friendly than you feared it would be.\" </p> <p>Barnes went on to pass his bar finals but by that time had realised he was getting more pleasure from \"spending half the week working on a novel round-up for the Oxford Mail than I ever would out of arguing Baker v Baker at the Dalston crown court.\" The die was cast and Barnes entered the rackety world of jobbing literary journalism, where he began to meet journalists, writers and editors. </p> <p>To mark his arrival in Grub Street he bought a bottle-green velvet suit. At a party someone asked him if it was his literary London suit. \"Not unkindly, but as if I were sporting L-plates on my trousers.\" Claire Tomalin was literary editor at the New Statesman. She interviewed Barnes for a job. \"He was very funny,\" she recalls. \"I asked why did he want the job and he put on this wonderful show of languor saying that he gathered the literary life involved sitting around all day and not doing much. Of course he was very hard-working and a terrific hit with readers from the start. He had such a sharp, cool wit.\" </p> <p>As a journalist, Barnes did high-class TV criticism for the Observer, having accepted the apparently poisoned chalice of following Clive James in the job. In the early 90s his stylish essays as London correspondent for the New Yorker were collected into a best-selling book. He started writing his first novel, Metroland, after the debacle of the Oxford book. It wasn't published until nine years later. \"I had a deep lack of confidence,\" he says. Presumably not helped by the interventions of his friends. He showed the typescript to Craig Raine and Christopher Reid. \"Craig said I should re-read Great Expectations and put in a wanking scene. Re-read was a very nice touch, so I didn't tell him that I hadn't read Great Expectations the first time. Christopher said put it away in a drawer as I would feel differently about it in a year's time.\" </p> <p>By the time publisher Liz Calder saw the book it was \"almost perfect\", she says. \"Its adolescent attitudes were so marvellously expressed I knew he was exactly the sort of writer that would work at Cape.\" The book went on to win the Somerset Maugham Award for a debut novel. </p> <p>The year in which Metroland appeared, 1980, was immensely productive for Barnes. Along with the literary journalism and acclaimed first novel, he also published a thriller featuring a bi-sexual Private Eye written under the other family name of Dan Kavanagh. He bashed out three more Kavanagh books over the next few years, taking a few weeks for each one. Liz Calder says they allowed him to use things like football and snooker from the laddish side of his life, but Barnes says they were never that successful and eventually ran out of steam. \"It got to the stage when Julian Barnes was subsidising Dan Kavanagh rather than the other way around. It was ridiculous that Flaubert's Parrot was supporting these low-life thrillers.\" </p> <p>Flaubert's Parrot, Barnes's third literary novel, was published in 1984 and launched him into the first division of British writers. Liz Calder had already published Metroland and his next novel, Before She Met Me. She remembers that when she asked him what he was doing next, her \"heart sank\". The book is packed with arcane Flaubertiana and won an award in France usually given to collections of essays. \"I thought why doesn't he just do another novel,\" remembers Calder. \"But when he sent in a few chapters I was completely blown away.\" </p> <p>Barnes says he was conscious that it was a departure. \"But it wasn't as if I was trying to follow up two international successes. I was following up two novels which had just stumbled into paperback and no one abroad wanted to buy.\" Flaubert's Parrot, he says, was actually turned down by Penguin. \"They said they liked it but thought it wouldn't sell any copies at all.\" </p> <p>The book became a worldwide bestseller and marked the point when Barnes changed from being a journalist who wrote novels to a novelist who did a bit of journalism. Two novels later, he wrote the even bigger-selling History Of The World In 10\u20ac Chapters, which sparked another is it/isn't it debate about whether it was a novel at all. </p> <p>The critic James Wood has written that Barnes \"is a brilliant essayist inside whom a novelist is struggling to get out\". Barnes takes the line that \"I'm a novelist and therefore it is a novel\". He says, \"The lesson you learn is that you pursue the passion of the book in the form that it has to be made. People will follow or not but you can't second-guess these things. It is liberating in that you write the book that has to be written and it has success or otherwise depending on factors you absolutely don't understand. I'd rather someone say they enjoyed my book but didn't think it's a novel, than someone say they didn't like my book but it is absolutely a novel. But thankfully that's not the choice.\" </p> <p>Jay McInerney applauds Barnes's range and versatility. \"A lot of novelists set up a kind of franchise, and turn out a familiar product. But what I like about Jules's work is that he's like an entrepreneur who starts up a new company every time out.\" His last two novels before Love, Etc prove the point. The Porcupine was set in the ostensibly very un-Barnes-like milieu of post-communist eastern Europe, while the Booker shortlisted England, England was set in the more familiar Isle of Wight but in the less familiar tone of a satire. </p> <p>Barnes reveres truth and honesty, and seeks to express them in whatever form of fiction he needs. \"Fiction is telling the truth by telling lies, as opposed to telling less of the truth by telling facts,\" he says. \"Even if you write something close to yourself, what you're aiming for is an objective construction artistically shaped. I admit that my early fiction was pretty close to my life, but then I learned to lie. </p> <p>\"You step off the land on to the ice and it doesn't give way. You start to skate and soon you aim for the double axle and the triple toe loop. When I read non-fiction I am often aware that it is merely a masquerade of the truth. When you read the great and beautiful liars of fiction you feel that this is what life is. This is true, even though it is all made up.\" </p> <p><strong> Life at a glance: Julian Patrick Barnes </strong></p> <p><strong>Born: </strong> 19 January 1946. </p> <p><strong> Education: </strong> City of London School; Magdalen College, Oxford. </p> <p><strong> Family: </strong> married Pat Kavanagh, 1979. </p> <p><strong> Career:</strong> lexicographer, OED 1969-72; contributing editor, New Review 1977; assistant literary editor, New Statesman; deputy literary editor, Sunday Times 1980-82; TV critic, Observer 1982-86; London correspondent, the New Yorker 1990-95. </p> <p><strong> Essays:</strong> Letters From London (1995). </p> <p><strong> As Dan Kavanagh:</strong> Duffy (1980); Fiddle City (1981); Putting The Boot In (1985); Going To The Dogs (1987). </p> <p><strong> Novels:</strong> Metroland (1980); Before She Met Me (1982); Flaubert's Parrot (1984); Staring At The Sun (1986); A History Of The World In 10 1/2 Chapters (1989); Talking It Over (1991); The Porcupine (1992); England, England (1998). </p> <p><strong> Awards:</strong> Officier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (1995). </p> <p> \u0095 Love, Etc is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a315.99).</p>",

      "bodyText": "There is a scene in Bridget Jones's Diary when Bridget unexpectedly finds herself standing in front of Julian Barnes at a literary party. Ms Jones, paralysed by Barnes's intimidating reputation for cool intelligence and languid wit, is struck dumb. The agonising silence is eventually broken when, to her own horror, she blurts out, \"Do you know where the toilets are?\" The resulting \"faint smile that hovered over his thin-but-attractive lips\" ensured her humiliation was made complete. The scene has been included in the film version of the diary which is currently in production in London. Although lots of real writers were gathered together by the producers to act as up-market extras, it was thought Barnes wasn't quite recognisable enough to a cinema-going audience to justify Bridget's level of mortification. So while Barnes stands around holding a glass of warm white wine and muttering \"rhubarb\", Salman Rushdie was parachuted in to precipitate the social catastrophe. When Barnes tells this story, he goes through the motions of huffing and puffing at the lack of respect shown to him and the cavalier attitude to the text adopted by superficial film-makers. But far from complaining that he is not famous enough, in reality one senses that Barnes feels he has more than enough fame, meaning in this case celebrity, already. He might be adamant that he is not an autobiographical writer, but when the narrator of his novel Flaubert's Parrot at one point asks, \"Why does the writing make us chase the writer? Why aren't the books enough?\" there is little doubt that he speaks for Barnes. None of this is to say he doesn't expect and appreciate the attention he gets as a front-rank journalist, essayist and most notably novelist. He is a wonderful prose stylist who has heeded Flaubert's dictum that words, like hair, \"shine with combing\". His work is both crowded with ideas and is emotionally acute as he dissects with a coldly knowing eye the way we live and, most of all, the way we love. In so doing Barnes has also pulled off the rare trick of producing work that is not only popular - it was as far back as 1996 that he sold his millionth paperback in Britain - but critically acclaimed. Graham Greene said Flaubert's Parrot was, \"intricate and delightful\". Nobel laureate Nadine Gordimer called his novel A History Of The World In 10\u20ac Chapters \"funny, ironic, erudite, surprising and not afraid to take a dive overboard into the depths of sorrow and loss\". Carlos Fuentes \"saluted\" him from Mexico, praising his work for being \"at the forefront of a new internationalisation of British fiction\". But the by-product of this success has meant his life has been periodically dragged into public view. \"In America, where all tendencies are admittedly exaggerated,\" he says, \"you have to make the decision immediately whether to go down the route of Mailer or Vidal or go down the reclusive route of Salinger or Pynchon. Both of which seem to me to lead to madness. It's not quite that bad over here but the question does remain.\" When the high-profile rift between Barnes and his former friend Martin Amis was recently rehashed in Amis's memoirs, Barnes maintained a characteristically scrupulous public silence. The row was precipitated when Amis changed literary agents in 1994. The agent he left was Pat Kavanagh, who is not only Barnes's agent but also his wife. Barnes still won't discuss the issue but says the closest he came to joining in the fray came when he read a letter to this newspaper following the serialisation of the memoirs. \"So, a bloke who writes books fell out with another bloke who writes books,\" observed the correspondent. \"Then they swore at each other. Can someone explain to me why this is worthy of my attention in an already crowded day?\" \"I thought, 'Yes!' when I read that letter,\" says Barnes. \"That's absolutely right. I nearly wrote to that man saying 'I'm with you on this one.' It seems that no sooner do you publish a book than everything from your bank account to your sex life become subjects about which the public have a right to know. I began to think that this wasn't in my book contract. I don't remember agreeing to all this.\" One source of aggravation for Barnes has been press fascination with an old affair between Pat Kavanagh and the novelist Jeanette Winterson. In fact, people close to the couple speak of their marriage as being particularly harmonious. \"They are actually a rather decorous couple,\" says one friend. \"They really have terrific complicity and an extraordinary closeness,\" says another. Yet such complications, added to the speculation that they appear as characters in other people's fiction, encourage the thought that Barnes must somehow be drawing on his own experiences. \"But I make things up,\" he protests. \"After my first book [Metroland] I have not been an autobiographical writer. Martin in Experience was saying that fiction is the higher autobiography. I just don't agree. My novels divide into what are called novels of ideas and novels of the personal life. It is tempting, but ultimately fallacious, to think that they are about my personal life. It is observation and imagination. There is nothing easier to make up than a convincing private life. Much easier to make up a sexual life than a financial life.\" Hermione Lee, as a friend and a biographer, has an ongoing debate with Barnes about the impact of the life on literary work. \"He dislikes the travesty version of a life that gets into the public domain when you are gossiped about, which is not unlike the things he resents about bad biography. Someone like Philip Roth is clearly writing his own life over and over again. It is completely different with Julian. Obviously he writes from his own state and habit of mind. His love of France is there and his visit to eastern Europe went into his novel set in eastern Europe, The Porcupine. But he's not writing novels about himself.\" Lee thinks this tendency to collapse the novels back into the life is particularly ironic in Barnes's case because he is so interested in \"imagining things and making them up and displacing himself into other characters and histories. Of course, he draws on his own emotions, but there is a difference between drawing on one's own life and writing autobiographical fic tion. He is terribly interested in people's relationships and what happens to love and friendship.\" His new novel, Love, Etc, carries on the story started in 1991 in Talking It Over in which Oliver, Stuart and Gillian talk straight to reader about their intense and funny love triangle. In the new book we meet them 10 years on. Barnes was once asked in a newspaper questionnaire what novels should have a sequel. \"None\" was his response, which begs the question. \"Fair cop,\" he says. \"I do generally believe that.\" But he was attracted back to the work because Talking It Over is the only book of his that people ask what happened to the characters afterwards. He also liked the idea of the characters speaking directly to the reader again. \"The membrane between the character and the reader is minimised.\" Love, Etc is a much darker book than Talking It Over. Through its minute choreography it unfolds the very Barnesian theme of what happens to love in a deeply mercantile society. \"I believe that the personal life is impinged on and has principles laid down by the general tenor and values of society,\" he says. \"It can't not. When societies were primarily religious, what love was and what it was for were different. What people wanted in 13th-century France was salvation, and beyond that economic and social position. Love as we think of it was an add-on. Then, with the decline of religion and the rise of romantic individualism, love came to be assumed not only to be the ultimate good but something that was somehow untainted. But it never is untainted, although it sometimes fools us that it is.\" \"It is interesting that he meditates on love to such an extent,\" says his friend, the writer Marina Warner. \"I don't know many novelists now who try to get to grips with it. How does one love well? How does one love so that one doesn't destroy or possess or inhibit?\" She also says how wounding it has been to him to have his privacy violated. \"But he is part of a group that seems to exercise remarkable powers of attraction.\" In the mid-70s, writers such as Amis and Ian McEwan began to impinge themselves on the public consciousness. Barnes, although a slightly later developer than his friends, was part of a group that not only had great talent but were soon exercising considerable clout in the book world. Indeed it seemed for many years that the only literary issue that mattered was whether Barnes, McEwan or Amis would ever win the Booker. Martin Amis might have been born into this trade and been name-dropping since he first said \"dad\". But it was all new to Barnes. The only member of his family who had ever had anything published was his mother, who once wrote a letter to the Evening Standard. \"She complained about girl students getting themselves pregnant and then expecting the state to look after them,\" he recalls. Barnes says that even when he was a student at Oxford the idea of being a writer was simply something that seemed off the radar. \"It was partly because I thought that art and literature were the supreme that I didn't think I could do it,\" he explains. \"I used to go to the English society and examine famous writers like Robert Graves and Stephen Spender who came to speak. I thought it must be wonderful to be a writer. But it was what other people did.\" That is not to say that Barnes had no expectation of achievement. His parents, both French teachers, \"weren't pushy in the sense that the fathers of girl tennis prodigies are pushy,\" he says, \"but it was assumed everything would work out all right. There was no specific career advice as there was no sex advice.\" Barnes was born in Leicester in 1946 but the family moved to suburban West London six weeks later. His one older brother is now a professor of philosophy working in Geneva. His childhood provided the location for his debut novel Metroland - \"J'habite metroland\" cynically proclaimed the young protagonist - as well as an intuitive understanding of the mores of a certain sort of middle-class English life. He didn't actually rebel against his upbringing but remembers living though a \"furious and puzzled boredom. It was waiting for life to happen and fearing that it would not.\" He went to City of London School, which entailed an hour and a quarter each way on the train and six hours of \"quite intense\" contact with other boys in between. Barnes played rugby and cricket, and won a scholarship to Oxford. He says the family response to this achievement was typical. \"I got home from school and a letter was waiting for me. I opened it up and said, 'I got a scholarship.' My mother said, 'Yes, I thought it was that.' It was a classic dampening down. Let's not get too excited.\" Outside of school, life was lived almost exclusively within the family unit and he says both he and his brother suffered a \"phobic reaction\" to this orthodoxy. \"After my brother went to university he virtually never came home again,\" he says. \"He would stay up over vacations and things like that. I was fairly estranged from my parents but did become closer to them in their later years. I was always very fond of my father, but my mother was a woman who I had to get away from for long periods.\" His brother Jonathan casually mentions that he has not seen Julian for \"a few years. We were chums when we were boys and I do always watch him when he is on French television. But we were never a close-knit family, thank God. We always thought that water was thicker than blood.\" Despite the distance between them, Jonathan Barnes says that his parents were proud of Julian's success and they had all his novels lined up on a shelf. \"My mother did say at one point that she couldn't read them because of the naughty bits,\" recalls Jonathan. \"But she must have read them to some degree to get to the naughty bits.\" Barnes's friends speak of an extraordinary loyalty and kindness, and he acknowledges that he may have constructed a family out of his friendships. \"The advantage of friends is that you choose them and they choose you. Instead of with a family where they are a given. I suppose I have pointless regrets for not coming from one of those large warm, extended, open families that exist in the mythology of the family. But I've very rarely seen one.\" Although he and Pat don't have children, he has four godchildren and enjoys being with his friends' children. His brother says he was very supportive and kind to his nieces when they were studying in London. \"He's the perfect uncle. I'm sure he would have been a very good father.\" In fact, his friend Jay McInerney has approvingly commented that the way the Barneses lead their life \"makes a great case for childlessness\". They have a beautiful house and garden in north London. Barnes is by all accounts an excellent cook and they regularly travel together for walking holidays. A habit of collecting first edition novels has now given way to collecting and drinking fine wine, and his friend, the wine writer Jancis Robinson says Barnes drinks better stuff than she does. Some people see this cultivation of the good things in life as slightly too meticulous. One observer characterised Barnes \"as the sort of person who washes his hands too often\", but Marina Warner says it is more \"a wise acceptance that his success means he can lead his life in an enriching way. He is a perfectionist with fantastic application.\" This meticulousness inevitably has a sharp side when confronted with the messiness of life, and Bridget Jones was probably right to display some apprehension. \"He has very high standards,\" says Jancis Robinson, \"by which I don't mean he worries whether or not the napkins are folded correctly. He wants everything to be good quality, whether that is a decision or a moral stance or a hunk of beef.\" Hermione Lee agrees that he can be very critical of \"some forms of behaviour: pretensions, sloppiness, showing off. You get on better with him if you behave well, which is different from behaving properly.\" It was all very different when Barnes went up to Oxford to study modern languages in 1964. He says he \"made a mess of the whole thing\", and failed to get the first which would have allowed him to follow his brother into postgraduate work. The swinging 60s \"partly\" happened to him: he bought the records - he is still a \"shameful\" owner of a boxed set of Donovan LPs - but the drugs passed him by. \"People spoke about things like big H and little H but you couldn't ask what they meant for fear of being uncool. I presume now it was heroin and hash.\" He also sidestepped the politics of the time. \"Other things seemed more interesting to me. The fact that I didn't understand one of Mallarm\u00e9's poems seemed more important than going to Grosvenor Square to protest against the Vietnam war.\" Today he devotes time to the fallout from politics and is a patron of Helen Bamber's Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture. He has arranged a series of fund- raising readings by writers including Jung Chang, Tom Stoppard, Ruth Rendell and Nick Hornby. \"Lots of people say they will help and then life overtakes and other commitments come along and they don't fulfil,\" says Bamber. \"But Julian, without any prompting, has kept this up year after year. It is hugely time consuming and he is really willing to put himself out.\" After Oxford, he did the civil service exams but instead of getting a position in the diplomatic service as he had hoped, he was offered a job as a tax inspector. \"It was humiliating and as I was rather snobbish I drew the line there.\" Instead, he signed on the dole for a while and then landed a job on the Oxford English Dictionary on the \"sports and dirty words section\". While there, he made his first contacts in the literary world. He met the poets Craig Raine and Christopher Reid and even had a book accepted for publication, although this was a false start. Barnes still has one copy of his Literary Guide To Oxford but says it is \"dreadful\". He had been paid an advance but after three years it had still not been published. \"So I wrote a firm but fair letter saying they should give me a date for publication and if they were not going to publish they should return the manuscript,\" he says. \"Never did a manuscript come back so quickly. And, worse, it had been copy-edited up to about page 60 by someone who obviously hated it and hadn't got any further.\" After three years, Barnes came to London to read for the bar. \"I was good at passing exams but I was deeply unsuited to standing up in court with a wig on my head and thinking on my feet as I was virtually mute at that time and very self-conscious. I remember when I worked at the New Statesman we had a messenger who delivered all the internal mail but none of the external messages. It turned out he was agoraphobic. I was a bit like him in that I chose the profession for which I was the least suited.\" However, the move in to the law gave him two years' breathing space in which he started writing book reviews. His first published piece was about the restoration of old buildings and was printed in the Times Educational Supplement. \"I was sharing a flat with an architectural historian at the time and I just used his knowledge.\" The architectural historian was Andrew Saint, now a professor at Cambridge, who recalls the time as one of \"drifting around in that semi-privileged post-Oxford languor\". He doesn't remember talking about books or about much else to Barnes, who he recalls as \"extremely taciturn. He really didn't speak very much at all. He had this slightly saturnine smile so you didn't really know what he was thinking. But having said that, when he did say something it was usually more friendly than you feared it would be.\" Barnes went on to pass his bar finals but by that time had realised he was getting more pleasure from \"spending half the week working on a novel round-up for the Oxford Mail than I ever would out of arguing Baker v Baker at the Dalston crown court.\" The die was cast and Barnes entered the rackety world of jobbing literary journalism, where he began to meet journalists, writers and editors. To mark his arrival in Grub Street he bought a bottle-green velvet suit. At a party someone asked him if it was his literary London suit. \"Not unkindly, but as if I were sporting L-plates on my trousers.\" Claire Tomalin was literary editor at the New Statesman. She interviewed Barnes for a job. \"He was very funny,\" she recalls. \"I asked why did he want the job and he put on this wonderful show of languor saying that he gathered the literary life involved sitting around all day and not doing much. Of course he was very hard-working and a terrific hit with readers from the start. He had such a sharp, cool wit.\" As a journalist, Barnes did high-class TV criticism for the Observer, having accepted the apparently poisoned chalice of following Clive James in the job. In the early 90s his stylish essays as London correspondent for the New Yorker were collected into a best-selling book. He started writing his first novel, Metroland, after the debacle of the Oxford book. It wasn't published until nine years later. \"I had a deep lack of confidence,\" he says. Presumably not helped by the interventions of his friends. He showed the typescript to Craig Raine and Christopher Reid. \"Craig said I should re-read Great Expectations and put in a wanking scene. Re-read was a very nice touch, so I didn't tell him that I hadn't read Great Expectations the first time. Christopher said put it away in a drawer as I would feel differently about it in a year's time.\" By the time publisher Liz Calder saw the book it was \"almost perfect\", she says. \"Its adolescent attitudes were so marvellously expressed I knew he was exactly the sort of writer that would work at Cape.\" The book went on to win the Somerset Maugham Award for a debut novel. The year in which Metroland appeared, 1980, was immensely productive for Barnes. Along with the literary journalism and acclaimed first novel, he also published a thriller featuring a bi-sexual Private Eye written under the other family name of Dan Kavanagh. He bashed out three more Kavanagh books over the next few years, taking a few weeks for each one. Liz Calder says they allowed him to use things like football and snooker from the laddish side of his life, but Barnes says they were never that successful and eventually ran out of steam. \"It got to the stage when Julian Barnes was subsidising Dan Kavanagh rather than the other way around. It was ridiculous that Flaubert's Parrot was supporting these low-life thrillers.\" Flaubert's Parrot, Barnes's third literary novel, was published in 1984 and launched him into the first division of British writers. Liz Calder had already published Metroland and his next novel, Before She Met Me. She remembers that when she asked him what he was doing next, her \"heart sank\". The book is packed with arcane Flaubertiana and won an award in France usually given to collections of essays. \"I thought why doesn't he just do another novel,\" remembers Calder. \"But when he sent in a few chapters I was completely blown away.\" Barnes says he was conscious that it was a departure. \"But it wasn't as if I was trying to follow up two international successes. I was following up two novels which had just stumbled into paperback and no one abroad wanted to buy.\" Flaubert's Parrot, he says, was actually turned down by Penguin. \"They said they liked it but thought it wouldn't sell any copies at all.\" The book became a worldwide bestseller and marked the point when Barnes changed from being a journalist who wrote novels to a novelist who did a bit of journalism. Two novels later, he wrote the even bigger-selling History Of The World In 10\u20ac Chapters, which sparked another is it/isn't it debate about whether it was a novel at all. The critic James Wood has written that Barnes \"is a brilliant essayist inside whom a novelist is struggling to get out\". Barnes takes the line that \"I'm a novelist and therefore it is a novel\". He says, \"The lesson you learn is that you pursue the passion of the book in the form that it has to be made. People will follow or not but you can't second-guess these things. It is liberating in that you write the book that has to be written and it has success or otherwise depending on factors you absolutely don't understand. I'd rather someone say they enjoyed my book but didn't think it's a novel, than someone say they didn't like my book but it is absolutely a novel. But thankfully that's not the choice.\" Jay McInerney applauds Barnes's range and versatility. \"A lot of novelists set up a kind of franchise, and turn out a familiar product. But what I like about Jules's work is that he's like an entrepreneur who starts up a new company every time out.\" His last two novels before Love, Etc prove the point. The Porcupine was set in the ostensibly very un-Barnes-like milieu of post-communist eastern Europe, while the Booker shortlisted England, England was set in the more familiar Isle of Wight but in the less familiar tone of a satire. Barnes reveres truth and honesty, and seeks to express them in whatever form of fiction he needs. \"Fiction is telling the truth by telling lies, as opposed to telling less of the truth by telling facts,\" he says. \"Even if you write something close to yourself, what you're aiming for is an objective construction artistically shaped. I admit that my early fiction was pretty close to my life, but then I learned to lie. \"You step off the land on to the ice and it doesn't give way. You start to skate and soon you aim for the double axle and the triple toe loop. When I read non-fiction I am often aware that it is merely a masquerade of the truth. When you read the great and beautiful liars of fiction you feel that this is what life is. This is true, even though it is all made up.\" Life at a glance: Julian Patrick Barnes Born: 19 January 1946. Education: City of London School; Magdalen College, Oxford.

      "bodyText": "Bill Clinton moved yesterday to bolster Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and to tighten the screws on the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, by threatening to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to west Jerusalem. Mr Clinton's move drew immediate denunciation from militant Palestinian opinion, which is adamantly opposed to such a controversial move, especially while the Middle East talks remain active. But Mr Clinton said he stood by the comments he had given in an interview with Israeli television, broadcast yesterday. Moving the US embassy has always been an aim for President Clinton, who first pledged himself to the idea while he was campaigning for the presidency in 1992. The collapse of the Camp David negotiations at the beginning of this week has reopened the idea, which US officials said yesterday was principally seen as a move to support Mr Barak, who is struggling to rebuild his government, rather than as an outright threat to Mr Arafat. In the interview Mr Clinton also warned the Palestinians not to press ahead with their intention to declare a Palestinian state on September 13. Breaking with years of caution on the embassy issue, Mr Clinton said in his interview that he had decided to review the matter when the talks ended in failure last Tuesday. \"I have always wanted to move our embassy to west Jerusalem,\" Mr Clinton said in a transcript released by the White House. \"I have not done so because I didn't want to do anything to undermine our ability to help to broker a secure and fair and lasting peace for Israelis and for Palestinians. But in light of what has happened I've taken that decision under review, and I'll make a decision sometime between now and the end of the year on that.\" Officials in Washington acknowledged two reasons for the review: support for Mr Barak; and a warning to the Palestinians. \"I'd lean heavily toward the first,\" one US official said. Elsewhere in the interview Mr Clinton heaped praise on Mr Barak, saying he was \"more courageous and more creative\" during the peace talks than Mr Arafat, and said that he wanted to take steps to strengthen US-Israeli ties, including helping to modernise Israel's armed forces. Mr Clinton said the Palestinians would be making a big mistake if they declare independence unilaterally as they have threatened to do. \"I think it would be a big mistake to take a unilateral action and walk away from the peace process, and if it happens there will inevitably be consequences not just here but throughout the world.\" In their joint statement at the end of Camp David, the Israelis and Palestinians said they recognised the importance of \"avoiding unilateral actions that prejudge the outcome of negotiations.\"",

      "bodyText": "The government's controversial immigration bond scheme is being dropped, the Foreign Office minister Keith Vaz announced last night. Jack Straw had been planning to impose immigration \"bonds\" on visa applicants who want to visit relatives in Britain, but Mr Vaz said the proposal would not now go ahead for technical reasons. The proposal had provoked a storm of criticism that it was racist from immigration groups and campaigners on behalf of the ethnic minorities. Following the criticism Mr Straw said he would press ahead with an initial trial scheme for visitors from the Philippines and Morocco only. In a humiliating retreat, Mr Vaz said last night that \"the developmental work on the pilot study has identified a number of practical issues. Moves towards a more flexible approach to the operation of immigration control - including the introduction of new IT systems for issuing visas at posts overseas - have frustrated attempts to design a simple and effective scheme for providing a bond facility for visitors\". The decision was smuggled out on the final day of the parliament in a written answer. The bonds were to have been introduced for the hundreds of thousands of people from the Indian sub-continent who visit Britain each year for weddings, funerals and other events on family visit visas. The idea was put forward by Indian organisations as an alternative for those refused visas because entry clearance officers suspected they would not leave Britain at the end of their family visit. It was proposed that the family members in Britain would put up a cash payment in advance of the visit, which would be returned when the visitor left the country. Initial reports that the bond was to be fixed at \u00a310,000 stirred fierce opposition to the scheme. Ministers later proposed the bond would be set at \u00a33,000. The pilot study on financial bonds had been due to begin in October at two posts overseas, Manila and Casablanca. It was due to run for six months, followed by a further six months to monitor departure from the United Kingdom, and a further, brief period for analysis of the results. It was to be used in borderline cases; as an alternative to refusing a family visit visa if the applicant's intention to leave the UK was in doubt. The latest figures show that in 1998 1,500 people were refused a family visit visa at the embassy in Manila and 350 in Casablanca.",

To some Unionists, it was as if the grey, grey skies of the Irish Republic had at last rolled northwards, Ian Paisley's famous fulmination against such metaphorical calamity finally lost.</p> <p>They were the last to leave the prison they still call Long Kesh, the one-time RAF camp. There were 46 of them, so many they had to leave in three batches.</p> <p>Wives and lovers, painstakingly made-up and sporting their finest clothes, arrived armed with champagne, confetti, party poppers and smothering kisses to greet their men, some murderers and bombers. The car park at the Maze prison, the most miserable of places, was a sea of unashamed joy, with children re-united with their fathers.</p> <p>No one meant to be triumphalist. But there were neither apologies nor regrets, and the air rang to the sound of hundreds of cheers. The ex-prisoners departed defiantly in convoys, horns blaring, bound for home-coming celebrations, believing they had defeated a jail which they said was built to break them.</p> <p>Jim McVeigh, 40, the last IRA officer commanding in the Maze, said: \"We walk free from this prison camp, as have our comrades before us, proud republicans, unbowed and unbroken. We are determined to pursue and achieve the goals for which so many gave their lives, the establishment of a united democratic socialist republic.\" He extended the hand of friendship to those who wanted to join in building a new future.</p> <p>Other notorious IRA men to leave yesterday included James McCardle, 31, the Docklands bomber, and Sean Kelly, 26, who murdered nine in the Shankill Road massacre. He allowed himself a quiet smile.</p> <p>To many Unionists, including supporters of the Good Friday agreement, such absolute republican confidence fuelled their jitters, particularly as Sinn Fein was to the fore. They fear less that IRA prisoners will re-offend, that republicans are winning the long game. They were hardly re-assured with news that dissident republicans were trying to smuggle a massive shipment of arms from Croatia. Many are unable to differentiate between the IRA and its offshoots.</p> <p>After two years, the early release scheme for paramilitary prisoners, the key, controversial plank of the agreement, yesterday reached its climax. All qualifying inmates still in custody were free to go, and 86 were released, all but eight from the Maze.</p> <p>It was one of those fulcrums, frequent over the past two years, marking progress in Northern Ireland, the largest one-day exodus in 30 years of the Troubles. It left a 130-acre jail, which once housed 1,700 men, with just 14 prisoners, and 750 officers to guard them.</p> <p>Up to 30,000 men had passed through the Nissen camps initially used for internment, and the eight H-blocks built during the IRA's 1975 ceasefire. Although it is expected to close in the autumn, no decision has been taken on proposals to construct a museum.</p> <p>It would be packed with history. The blanket and dirty protests evolved over five years into hunger strikes, when 10 republicans starved themselves to death in 1981 in pursuit of political status.</p> <p>The IRA hit back in September 1983, mounting a spectacular escape, with 19 managing to break clear.</p> <p>IRA double murderer Liam Averill, 32, made his getaway dressed as a woman after a children's Christmas party nine months later. He is still at large.</p> <p>Then there was murder. The Irish National Liberation Army shot dead Billy Wright, 37, the leader of the Loyalist Volunteer Force, with a smuggled gun at the Maze two days after Christmas, 1997.</p> <p>Three months later, David Keys, 26, one of four men charged with murdering a Catholic and a Protestant friend in a pub in Poyntzpass, was butchered after he passed information to police.</p> <p>Prison officers saw 29 of their colleagues murdered. At least another six are believed to have committed suicide.</p> <p>The atmosphere yesterday was changed utterly. It had been threatening earlier when loyalists from rival groups warily circled each other as they waited for their own prisoners. Eight Ulster Volunteer Force prisoners emerged from a disguised gate just before 9.30am, quickly making off in cars.</p> <p>Johnny Adair, the notorious Ulster Freedom Fighter commander, greeted the 12 UFF prisoners who then emerged to roars of approval and paramilitary chants.</p> <p>He said: \"I hope it is the end of the conflict and the Maze. I hope there will be no more suffering, no more pain, and no more young men going to jail.\"</p> <p>The day, though, was most trying for the bereaved. Many showed astonishing compassion.

      "bodyText": "By the time it came to the Irish Republican Army yesterday, the thunder was rumbling in the distance and the heavens had opened. To some Unionists, it was as if the grey, grey skies of the Irish Republic had at last rolled northwards, Ian Paisley's famous fulmination against such metaphorical calamity finally lost. They were the last to leave the prison they still call Long Kesh, the one-time RAF camp. There were 46 of them, so many they had to leave in three batches. Wives and lovers, painstakingly made-up and sporting their finest clothes, arrived armed with champagne, confetti, party poppers and smothering kisses to greet their men, some murderers and bombers. The car park at the Maze prison, the most miserable of places, was a sea of unashamed joy, with children re-united with their fathers. No one meant to be triumphalist. But there were neither apologies nor regrets, and the air rang to the sound of hundreds of cheers. The ex-prisoners departed defiantly in convoys, horns blaring, bound for home-coming celebrations, believing they had defeated a jail which they said was built to break them. Jim McVeigh, 40, the last IRA officer commanding in the Maze, said: \"We walk free from this prison camp, as have our comrades before us, proud republicans, unbowed and unbroken. We are determined to pursue and achieve the goals for which so many gave their lives, the establishment of a united democratic socialist republic.\" He extended the hand of friendship to those who wanted to join in building a new future. Other notorious IRA men to leave yesterday included James McCardle, 31, the Docklands bomber, and Sean Kelly, 26, who murdered nine in the Shankill Road massacre. He allowed himself a quiet smile. To many Unionists, including supporters of the Good Friday agreement, such absolute republican confidence fuelled their jitters, particularly as Sinn Fein was to the fore. They fear less that IRA prisoners will re-offend, that republicans are winning the long game. They were hardly re-assured with news that dissident republicans were trying to smuggle a massive shipment of arms from Croatia. Many are unable to differentiate between the IRA and its offshoots. After two years, the early release scheme for paramilitary prisoners, the key, controversial plank of the agreement, yesterday reached its climax. All qualifying inmates still in custody were free to go, and 86 were released, all but eight from the Maze. It was one of those fulcrums, frequent over the past two years, marking progress in Northern Ireland, the largest one-day exodus in 30 years of the Troubles. It left a 130-acre jail, which once housed 1,700 men, with just 14 prisoners, and 750 officers to guard them. Up to 30,000 men had passed through the Nissen camps initially used for internment, and the eight H-blocks built during the IRA's 1975 ceasefire. Although it is expected to close in the autumn, no decision has been taken on proposals to construct a museum. It would be packed with history. The blanket and dirty protests evolved over five years into hunger strikes, when 10 republicans starved themselves to death in 1981 in pursuit of political status. The IRA hit back in September 1983, mounting a spectacular escape, with 19 managing to break clear. IRA double murderer Liam Averill, 32, made his getaway dressed as a woman after a children's Christmas party nine months later. He is still at large. Then there was murder. The Irish National Liberation Army shot dead Billy Wright, 37, the leader of the Loyalist Volunteer Force, with a smuggled gun at the Maze two days after Christmas, 1997. Three months later, David Keys, 26, one of four men charged with murdering a Catholic and a Protestant friend in a pub in Poyntzpass, was butchered after he passed information to police. Prison officers saw 29 of their colleagues murdered. At least another six are believed to have committed suicide. The atmosphere yesterday was changed utterly. It had been threatening earlier when loyalists from rival groups warily circled each other as they waited for their own prisoners. Eight Ulster Volunteer Force prisoners emerged from a disguised gate just before 9.30am, quickly making off in cars. Johnny Adair, the notorious Ulster Freedom Fighter commander, greeted the 12 UFF prisoners who then emerged to roars of approval and paramilitary chants. He said: \"I hope it is the end of the conflict and the Maze. I hope there will be no more suffering, no more pain, and no more young men going to jail.\" The day, though, was most trying for the bereaved. Many showed astonishing compassion. Philomena Morgan, whose son James, 16, a Catholic, was murdered in a sickening sectarian attack in 1997, said she would still vote for the agreement. If the release of his killer, Norman Coopey, 29, helped secure political progress, it was a price worth paying. The Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, who had hoped for more humility from those being freed, said: \"It's a difficult pill to swallow. The question is whether the peace we have, and it is admittedly an imperfect one, justifies the pain. If this helps to deliver peace in the long term, I believe this is justified.\"",

Amid buildings of concrete and plastic, heavyweight sound systems pound out booming beats, and masses of bodies sweat and move in time.</p> <p>Cheap beer and cocktails are consumed in large quantities, and at times tensions mount. Fights break out, as happened last weekend when a young Briton narrowly escaped with his life after being stabbed during a BBC Radio 1 dance party.</p> <p>This is Ayia Napa, the resort on the east coast of Cyprus which, within a few years, has changed from a retreat for families to a dance mecca, hailed as the new Ibiza - a magnet to hordes of youngsters in search of cheap and easy sun, sand and whatever extras they can find.</p> <p>It is without doubt a Mediterranean boom town, with awkward growing pains, a place where cultures clash.</p> <p>One writer described cooking fish in the summer of 1972 on an empty beach and dozing off, to be woken not by crashing dance music but by sand flies. At that time this tranquil fishing village was home to only 100 or so men, women and children. Then came the Turkish invasion of northern Cyprus in 1974. Resort towns were taken over, and some displaced landowners, among them hoteliers, were compensated with tracts of land in and around Ayia Napa.</p> <p>Tourism rapidly overtook fishing as the area's principal industry. Many who had lived there for generations sold up to developers and moved into the hills. The holidaymakers began to arrive.It is less simple to pinpoint just how hard dance music, especially UK garage - upbeat, softened with a touch of soul - found Ayia Napa in the past few years.</p> <p>Orestis Rossides, director of the Cyprus tourist board, said: \"Ten years ago there were only a couple of discotheques. There was a young crowd which hung around the square, but there were many more families in hotels and villas on the edge of the village.\"</p> <p>Ayia Napa now takes in around half a million of the tourists in Cyprus - 2.5m this year. Ibiza entertained just over 2m last year. Around half of those who find their way to Ayia Napa will have come for the nightlife. Hotels and apartments are almost as packed as the dance floors. Mr Rossides is unsure whether the town had changed for the better. \"The balance may have shifted too much to the young,\" he says.</p> <p>Two or three years ago, club owners heard of the UK garage scene, then attracting crowds of affluent young people. mainly to clubs in London. Ambitiously, they ditched their 1970s favourites and began signing clubs and DJs to fly out. Now they play to 2,000-capacity venues such as Pzazz, paying top DJs \u00a31,500 an hour.</p> <p>Ayia Napa has come to be seen as one of the few Mediterranean resorts attractive, because of its music, to large numbers of black young people who never really took to Ibiza's rave-oriented scene. At 3am the town centre vibrates with the sounds of competing clubs. New ones seem to be opening monthly as businessmen realise there is cash to be made.</p> <p>Some try to draw the crowds with gimmicks. The Ice Club has a snow machine and air conditioning that makes the interior so cold it almost knocks the breath out of the visitor. The Castle Club's facade boasts turrets and towers constructed out of imitation stone, a jarring contrast with the 16th-century monastery nearby. Others use big names to draw the attention of the passing trade. Club Abyss features an unconfirmed visit from the singer-turned-DJ Boy George on its publicity material.</p> <p>Nobody disputes that music is king here. The Castle plays host to the ultra-hip Ministry of Sound this weekend, a seal of its credibility. The clubs, which charge around \u00a310 on the door and offer cheap beer, do deliver, and the punters respond even to somewhat dubious chants such as \"We say Ayia, you say Napa!

      "bodyText": "The warm night air is filled with the scent of jasmine, and the Mediterranean laps on to a pristine sandy beach - an idyllic, peaceful scene apart from the distant rumble of dance music. Amid buildings of concrete and plastic, heavyweight sound systems pound out booming beats, and masses of bodies sweat and move in time. Cheap beer and cocktails are consumed in large quantities, and at times tensions mount. Fights break out, as happened last weekend when a young Briton narrowly escaped with his life after being stabbed during a BBC Radio 1 dance party. This is Ayia Napa, the resort on the east coast of Cyprus which, within a few years, has changed from a retreat for families to a dance mecca, hailed as the new Ibiza - a magnet to hordes of youngsters in search of cheap and easy sun, sand and whatever extras they can find. It is without doubt a Mediterranean boom town, with awkward growing pains, a place where cultures clash. One writer described cooking fish in the summer of 1972 on an empty beach and dozing off, to be woken not by crashing dance music but by sand flies. At that time this tranquil fishing village was home to only 100 or so men, women and children. Then came the Turkish invasion of northern Cyprus in 1974. Resort towns were taken over, and some displaced landowners, among them hoteliers, were compensated with tracts of land in and around Ayia Napa. Tourism rapidly overtook fishing as the area's principal industry. Many who had lived there for generations sold up to developers and moved into the hills. The holidaymakers began to arrive.It is less simple to pinpoint just how hard dance music, especially UK garage - upbeat, softened with a touch of soul - found Ayia Napa in the past few years. Orestis Rossides, director of the Cyprus tourist board, said: \"Ten years ago there were only a couple of discotheques. There was a young crowd which hung around the square, but there were many more families in hotels and villas on the edge of the village.\" Ayia Napa now takes in around half a million of the tourists in Cyprus - 2.5m this year. Ibiza entertained just over 2m last year. Around half of those who find their way to Ayia Napa will have come for the nightlife. Hotels and apartments are almost as packed as the dance floors. Mr Rossides is unsure whether the town had changed for the better. \"The balance may have shifted too much to the young,\" he says. Two or three years ago, club owners heard of the UK garage scene, then attracting crowds of affluent young people. mainly to clubs in London. Ambitiously, they ditched their 1970s favourites and began signing clubs and DJs to fly out. Now they play to 2,000-capacity venues such as Pzazz, paying top DJs \u00a31,500 an hour. Ayia Napa has come to be seen as one of the few Mediterranean resorts attractive, because of its music, to large numbers of black young people who never really took to Ibiza's rave-oriented scene. At 3am the town centre vibrates with the sounds of competing clubs. New ones seem to be opening monthly as businessmen realise there is cash to be made. Some try to draw the crowds with gimmicks. The Ice Club has a snow machine and air conditioning that makes the interior so cold it almost knocks the breath out of the visitor. The Castle Club's facade boasts turrets and towers constructed out of imitation stone, a jarring contrast with the 16th-century monastery nearby. Others use big names to draw the attention of the passing trade. Club Abyss features an unconfirmed visit from the singer-turned-DJ Boy George on its publicity material. Nobody disputes that music is king here. The Castle plays host to the ultra-hip Ministry of Sound this weekend, a seal of its credibility. The clubs, which charge around \u00a310 on the door and offer cheap beer, do deliver, and the punters respond even to somewhat dubious chants such as \"We say Ayia, you say Napa! Boom!\" Stabbing Television crews and radio stations have arrived en masse, most notoriously the programme-makers who dubbed Cyprus \"fantasy island\" on Channel 4. Those who seek to maintain Ayia Napa as a hip resort for serious music lovers, not to mention the town council, were aghast at the programme's focus on laddish drink and sex. Some now believe an influx of young revellers not really interested in the music has changed the nature of the resort. The full facts of the stabbing at the weekend have not surfaced, but it seems that a fight broke out at a daytime party on the resort's Nissi Beach organised by Radio 1, its first visit to Cyprus after successful broadcasts from Ibiza. The station's security officers quickly separated the groups, but the fighting continued away from the venue, and Andrew Grey, 35, was stabbed. Two men were arrested on Sunday night as they tried to leave Cyprus. The incident does not help to quell growing unease about the resort. There is also the fear that more drugs are seeping in, despite the island's \"zero tolerance\" policy. In May a 23-year-old builder from Cornwall was jailed for three months after being found with seven ecstasy tablets in Ayia Napa, and this month a man of 25 from Coventry died from an overdose. Cypriot police, optimistic that the island will never have the same drug culture as Ibiza, believe the club owners take a more responsible attitude. However, the situation has worried the town's mayoress, Barbara Pericleous, who has been making noises about a clampdown on clubs By 5am dawn is breaking over the town, and the crowds are beginning to leave the clubs. It is easy to pick out the music aficionados from the sex and sand crew. A pair of teenagers wearing replica football shirts aim their moped at a well-dressed group of friends from south London. One of the group lashes out and connects with the machine, but it stays upright. Tim Jarvis, 23, who is on his second visit, said: \"Last year it was a much cooler place, everybody having a good time. Now there seems to be a more rowdy element here.\" By 6am the street cleaners have moved in to clear the detritus of last night's partying.

The figures - a Red Bull, a Black Gryphon, a White Ram and a Crowned Salmon, concealing a coded history of the Dacre family including an elopement - are regarded as unique survivors of a lost world of English medieval and Tudor heraldic carving.

      "bodyText": "Britain's first international gay sports games take place this weekend, with the organisers planning a bid for the 2010 Gay Olympics if the event proves a success. Hundreds of gay teams and athletes from around Britain, Europe and the United States are taking part in the UK Gay Sports festival in Waltham Forest, east London, the largest such event in the country. Thousands of spectators are expected at competitions ranging from football and rugby to bridge, swimming and volleyball. The festival's size highlights the emergence of gay sports, partly as a consequence of the problems faced by some gay athletes who encounter hostility within mainstream clubs. This festival is organised by Waltham Forest council, which plans to lead the 2010 Olympics bid along with gay sports groups, and hopes to use a new Olympic stadium at Picketts Lock, north London, as the main venue. Since the first Gay Olympics in San Francisco in 1982, the gay event has come near to rivalling the Olympics themselves, attracting millions of pounds in sponsorship while generating a large revenue for the cities staging them. The last Gay Olympics, in Amsterdam in 1998, attracted 15,000 participants and generated \u00a380m for the host city; Vancouver and Los Angeles have also hosted the event. The next takes place in Sydney in 2002, using many of the venues for the Olympic games in September. Bidding for the 2006 Gay Olympics has closed, with five cities around the world hoping to win the right to stage them. Sue Emerson of Team UK, the co-ordinating body for gay sports, said: \"Lots of gay people feel excluded from mainstream sport because of locker room jokes and other hostile attitudes. \"Gay sports people have to put up with a lot of abuse. \"Many feel comfortable and more relaxed in gay sports events. The Gay Olympics have become a massive event. \"We will be writing to the sports minister [Kate Hoey] and the British Olympic Association, telling them of our plan for a 2010 London bid. There's a huge economic benefit to staging these games.\" Waltham Forest council has been criticised for spending \u00a340,000 on this weekend's event, and anticipates more criticism over bidding for the 2010 event. A spokeswoman said: \"The response has been very good across the whole of the borough, but we have been disappointed with some of the coverage. \"Bringing the Gay Olympics to London would be good for the whole of the city - we know about the strength of the pink pound, and there would be huge economic benefits. \"Gay Olympics have been staged in major cities across the world. We don't understand why people in this country are so hung up about issues like this. The time has come to move on.\" The number of gay sports clubs has increased dramatically in the past few years, with gay athletes claiming that they face discrimination within mainstream sport. Felix Zinc is a long distance runner taking part in this weekend's event, and a member of Front Runners, a gay running group. He said: \"There's a lot of gay athletes who don't feel comfortable in mainstream sport. Problems often arise over changing facilities, and there can be problems mixing socially after an event.

In a separate statement, the transport ministry said last night that \"from the information available at present, it emerges that at least one tyre burst, something that could have triggered a chain of events, damage to the plane's structure, a fire and subsequent engine failure\". Air France admitted yesterday that bursting tyres had in the past damaged fuel tanks and engines on Concordes, and strenuously denied a French newspaper report that its ground crews had carried out lengthy repairs on the afterburners of the plane's two port engines, both of which burst into flame as the jet was set to take off from Charles de Gaulle airport, Paris. Saying it \"deplored the publication of incorrect information\", the company did however confirm that routine maintenance was performed on the ageing supersonic plane - and all four engines tested - before the takeoff.

      "bodyText": "The Conservatives launched a counter-offensive yesterday against the government's NHS plan, accusing ministers of cynical manipulation of figures to exaggerate the growth in staff numbers and facilities that could be attributed to the recent strategic review. Liam Fox, the shadow health secretary, cast doubt on four promises made by Tony Blair - increases in the numbers of consultants, GPs, nurses and acute beds. A fact sheet issued by the Department of Health on Thursday to support Mr Blair's statement said: \"As a result of the NHS plan, there will be between now and 2005: 7,500 more consultants (30% more than now).\" Dr Fox said this was misleading, because most of these extra consultants were already in training and would have gained these senior positions within five years, even if there had been no national plan. The British Medical Association said it was not accusing ministers of a deliberate sleight of hand, but they had not mentioned that numbers of consultants had been growing anyway at 5% a year. \"If there had been no national plan at all, we would still have expected to see by 2005 an extra 4,500 consultants.

It was too soon to say what proportion of the new nurses would be part-timers, but there was a trend to more flexible working to suit potential recruits. \u0095 William Hague's economic policy appeared to be in disarray last night after a Treasury-backed analysis clocked up more than \u00a35bn of new Tory spending commitments in the space of just two months, writes Nicholas Watts . Labour accused the Tories of creating a \u00a35bn \"black hole\" in their spending plans which raised fresh doubts about Mr Hague's ability to cut taxes. The Tory leadership has promised to spend less than Labour in order to leave room for tax cuts. The new hole identified in the Tory's spending plans showed that Mr Hague would struggle to cut costs. Christopher Leslie, a Labour ministerial aide, said last night that he was astonished at the \"profligacy\" of the Tories. \"At the rate the Tories are going there will be nothing left in the exchequer if they take over,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "The supermarket price war stepped up a gear yesterday when two major chains announced they were cutting the cost of petrol, days before the start of a boycott of the pumps. Morrison's was the first to announce the price cut yesterday, followed by Sainsbury's several hours later. Both reduced the price of unleaded petrol and diesel to 79.9p a litre from an average of 81.9p and 83.9p respectively from midnight yesterday. Their decision has been encouraged by the falling cost-price of unleaded petrol -down by more than a quarter in the last three weeks - and the prospect of a road users' campaign for a one day boycott of petrol stations on Tuesday, August 1, aimed at forcing the government to reduce fuel duty. The Dump the Pump campaigners, supported by the Road Haulage Association and tabloid newspapers, have said that, if their protest is a success, it will be repeated on subsequent Mondays. Mark Hooper, Sainsbury's senior manager for petrol, said: \"We want to ensure that our motorists benefit from the falling market costs as soon as possible, and hope that other national retailers follow suit.\" Simon Davies, of Morrison's, said: \"When the price of crude oil rises, petrol prices usually follow. In this instance, the cost of oil is falling, and we are acting decisively to ensure our customers receive the full benefit of the lower price -passing on much needed savings as soon as possible.\" A spokesman for Tesco, which charges an average of 82.9p per litre for petrol, refused to say if the supermarket would reduce its prices. He said: \"We have a price guarantee that we will match the price of petrol if it is found to be cheaper within a three-mile radius.\" Another supermarket chain, Asda, said that some of its petrol stations had been selling unleaded petrol for 79.5p a litre for several weeks. Edmund King, executive director of the RAC Foundation, a charity that is part of the motoring organisation and conducts research on its behalf, said it had been inundated with calls from motorists complaining about the high cost of petrol - particularly, he claimed, from elderly and disabled people, and those in rural areas who were dependent on their cars. \"If supermarkets are taking the lead in bringing the prices down, then hopefully it will be reflected in petrol pumps across the country. Normally other companies follow suit days later,\" he said. \"For many families, fuel is now their number one expenditure ahead of food and rent costs.\"",

They accepted that the science of genetic testing was moving at breathtaking speed, and it was increasingly difficult for the law to keep pace.</p> <p>However, Ms Cooper and Lord Sainsbury tell the commission that very specific \"genetic tests might provide valuable information, if appropriately used, to detect a condition that may put the employee or others at risk in the workplace\".</p> <p>The implication - not explicitly stated in the letter - is that tests might be passed on if they showed a propensity to infectious or mental illnesses. It also suggests that evidence might be passed to employers if the tests indicated that someone was unsuitable to operate specific machinery.</p> <p>But the ministers suggest that in even these circumstances the onus would legally remain on the employers to make sure the workplace was as safe as possible for the employee.</p> <p>They recommend the health and safety commission to involve geneticists, employers and trade union representatives in monitoring developments in genetic screening as they apply to health and safety at work.</p> <p>The ministers say the data protection commissioner should develop a code of practice on the use of personal data in relations between employers and employees. The code is likely to be published in the autumn.</p> <p>The human genetics commission is also examining guidelines to prevent the use of genetic testing in insurance. Some insurers are keen to extend its use to increase premiums for individuals prone to disease.</p> <p>The government is likely to support a ban on job applicants being required to take genetic tests, believing that an individual's right not to know his or her genetic constitution should be upheld.</p> <p>Only in very specific circumstance should an employer be permitted to refuse a job: where public safety issues arise and the individual refuses to take a test.</p> <p>However, the two ministers, drawing on work from the disability rights task force, recommend that at present genetic predispositions to impairments should not be classified as a disability under the Disability Discrimination Act.</p> <p>Overall they argue: \"The government wishes to ensure that, once genetic testing has advanced to the stage where the use of test results by employers becomes a realistic proposition, it has in place proper safeguards to prevent such information being used unfairly.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government is proposing to prevent employers being given access to results of genetic tests on staff or potential recruits, according to a joint letter from the public health minister, Yvette Cooper, and the science minister, Lord Sainsbury. The letter puts the government's view on the issue to the human genetics commission, chaired by Lady Kennedy QC, which is reviewing the law on genetics testing in employment. In their letter, Lord Sainsbury and Ms Cooper accept that the use of genetic testing is growing, particularly in health care. But they suggest \"that it would not be acceptable for employers to use the information arising from genetic tests to predict future poor health of potential or existing employees, or to exclude people from employment or advancement\". Department of Health sources said ministers would back a legal ban if they believed it was necessary. They accepted that the science of genetic testing was moving at breathtaking speed, and it was increasingly difficult for the law to keep pace. However, Ms Cooper and Lord Sainsbury tell the commission that very specific \"genetic tests might provide valuable information, if appropriately used, to detect a condition that may put the employee or others at risk in the workplace\". The implication - not explicitly stated in the letter - is that tests might be passed on if they showed a propensity to infectious or mental illnesses. It also suggests that evidence might be passed to employers if the tests indicated that someone was unsuitable to operate specific machinery. But the ministers suggest that in even these circumstances the onus would legally remain on the employers to make sure the workplace was as safe as possible for the employee. They recommend the health and safety commission to involve geneticists, employers and trade union representatives in monitoring developments in genetic screening as they apply to health and safety at work. The ministers say the data protection commissioner should develop a code of practice on the use of personal data in relations between employers and employees. The code is likely to be published in the autumn. The human genetics commission is also examining guidelines to prevent the use of genetic testing in insurance. Some insurers are keen to extend its use to increase premiums for individuals prone to disease. The government is likely to support a ban on job applicants being required to take genetic tests, believing that an individual's right not to know his or her genetic constitution should be upheld. Only in very specific circumstance should an employer be permitted to refuse a job: where public safety issues arise and the individual refuses to take a test. However, the two ministers, drawing on work from the disability rights task force, recommend that at present genetic predispositions to impairments should not be classified as a disability under the Disability Discrimination Act. Overall they argue: \"The government wishes to ensure that, once genetic testing has advanced to the stage where the use of test results by employers becomes a realistic proposition, it has in place proper safeguards to prevent such information being used unfairly.\"",

Jalal Talabani, the leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), was at pains to play down the extent of the threat, but he admitted privately that nothing could be ruled out. Reports of an Iraqi military build-up on the borders of the Kurdish enclave have circulated for several weeks, since an Iraqi defector revealed plans for a military operation to recapture the city of Sulaymaniyah, which serves as Mr Talabani's headquarters. The operation - called Fair Retribution - would also involve the seizure of two dams which supply water to central Iraq, where a severe drought is well into its second year. Northern Iraq has been ruled by two rival Kurdish factions since shortly after the end of the Gulf war in 1991, but Baghdad wants to bring the region back under its control. Mr Talabani said that up to 50,000 Iraqi troops were stationed close to the Kurdish enclave, and three army corps, backed up by units of the republican guard, were facing the area administered by the PUK. Iraq's leaked military plans involve three infantry divisions, accompanied by hundreds of tanks, moving swiftly to surround Sulaymaniyah.

      "bodyText": "Patrick Renshaw had his whole academic future before him when his Oxford college sent an urgent postcard to his digs half a mile away. Yesterday, four years after he retired as a senior don with an international reputation, he heard that the card had finally arrived. It came 40 years late, unstamped, with an excess postage demand for four pre-decimal pennies (just over 1p). Postmarked May 11, 1960, the card asked him to fill in a form sent at the beginning of term \"and return it as soon as possible\". Mr Renshaw, until recently reader in American politics at Sheffield University, was, at the time the card was sent, a postgraduate scholar at Queen's College, Oxford, who was applying for scholarships to study in the US. The Royal Mail persisted in its attempts to find him. A second postmark on the card shows that it was recently sent to the Sheffield sorting office, which failed to trace his local address. So earlier this week, the Sheffield office sent it to Mr Renshaw's old digs in Oxford. Its arrival amazed John Crabtree, the don who lives there now. Told yesterday by the Guardian where Mr Renshaw currently lives, Mr Crabtree said he would forward it to him. A Royal Mail spokeswoman said: \"We occasionally get mishaps like this.\"",

Sweden was informed that it too would have to answer to the European court of justice in Luxembourg, where fines can be imposed. Spain got off with a warning. According to an EU report issued in May, three out of four Blackpool beaches and both in neighbouring St Anne's remain below par for testing under the EU's bathing water quality directive. Britain had already received an official warning from Brussels about sub-standard beaches, including Exmouth, Instow and Westward Ho, Bembridge, Southsea, Cleethorpes, Southport and South Shields. Margot Wallstrom, the environment commissioner, said: \"As the commission has indicated on numerous occasions, we are serious about ensuring bathing water quality compliance in all member states.\" The Conservative's environment spokesman, Damian Green, said: \"John Prescott has been fingered as the dirty man of Europe.

British beachgoers should be able to enjoy clean beaches wherever they go in Europe and will be delighted that high European standards are being enforced here.\" Under the directive, the 15 member states have to ensure that water at designated coastal and inland bathing areas is safe to swim in. The directive aims to ensure that bathing waters meet minimum quality criteria by establishing a set of binding standards for a range of key parameters, including the presence of faecal bacteria in sea water. But a spokeswoman for the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions said: \"The commission's decision is disappointing.

      "bodyText": "Venezuela's charismatic leader, President Hugo Chavez, is expected to be re-elected tomorrow in the county's sixth election in the past 18 months - despite flagging military support for him that threatens to destabilise the country's \"peaceful revolution\". Since he came to power in February last year, Mr Chavez has overhauled Venezuelan politics by tearing down virtually every institution and rebuilding them to his liking. Tomorrow's election seems certain to hand the former army paratrooper six more years in charge - he leads his challenger by 20% in the opinion polls. But despite the almost religious devotion he inspires among the 80% of Venezuelans who live below the poverty line, Mr Chavez's transformation of the political landscape has failed to improve their livelihoods. The ranks of the country's unemployed grew by 500,000 in 1999, its economy declined by 7% and foreign investors withdrew more than \u00a35bn from the oil-rich country. Mr Chavez, 46, who was jailed in 1992 after launching a botched coup attempt, claims that tomorrow's election will be the final piece in the political jigsaw that will allow him to plough ahead with his left-leaning social reforms. \"After the elections, the political confrontation will be left behind,\" he vowed during his final campaign rally this week. \"We will devote our hearts to the social and economic recovery of Venezuela.\" While many people in Latin America see in Mr Chavez a nationalist saviour along the lines of the independence hero, Simon Bolivar, there are those to whom he reawakens memories of another icon of the continent's political heritage, the military caudillo (strongman). As was perhaps inevitable from a career soldier, Mr Chavez has increased the role of the military by appointing officers to important civilian positions, giving service personnel the right to vote, increasing spending on arms and mobilising thousands of troops for non-military duties, such as painting schools, repairing hospitals and running food markets. But instead of forging a powerful ally, insiders say, he has upset many within the armed forces by meddling in their affairs. Concern with the Chavez administration is not restricted to the military; the president's challenger, Francisco Arias Cardenas, once a colleague in the 1992 coup attempt, broke away from Mr Chavez this year, accusing him of betraying the goals of the rebellion. Mr Cardenas and other opposition candidates have been trying to capitalise on the acute economic slump that has hounded Mr Chavez's reign, despite a surge in the international price of oil, Venezuela's main export. Mr Chavez blames the downturn on decades of corruption in the previous governments, but international analysts are sceptical about his ability to pull the economy out of crisis.",

Denounced by the opposition and some members of Mr Jospin's cabinet, including the radical republican interior minister, Jean-Pierre Chev\u00e8nement, who could resign over the issue, the plan marks a huge departure from France's cherished notion of national integrity and has sparked fears that other regions like Brittany, Alsace, the Basque country and Languedoc may demand similar treatment.

Satisfying a key demand of the nationalists, the plan also requires the Corsican language to be taught in all primary and junior schools \"within normal school hours\".

Lebanon, still disputing that Israel has fully withdrawn, played down the significance of the move.

Until now the Kremlin has publicly insisted that Mr Maskhadov would have to guarantee an end to all hostilities before any kind of talks could begin. Katyn massacre remembered Russian and Polish officials gathered at Katyn, the scene of one of the Soviet Union's most brutal massacres yesterday, to dedicate a memorial to more than 4,000 Polish army officers murdered there by Stalin's secret police. The officers were shot and dumped in mass graves in April and May 1940 - an act the communist authorities denied for decades.

In recent years, some 60,000 Jews have flocked to Germany from eastern Europe and Russia, lured by special entry permits and resettlement facilities.</p> <p>The victims came from Russia, Ukraine and Azerbaijan. They had just left a daily German-language class paid for by the government and were on their way to catch a train to the nearby town of Solingen when they were caught by the blast. The bomb, packed with shrapnel, had been placed on a footbridge leading to the station.</p> <p>A spokesman for the prosecutor's office in D\u00fcsseldorf said: \"We can't rule out any motive, including an anti-foreigner motive.\"</p> <p>Police experts were yesterday trying to reconstruct the explosive device to establish whether it was detonated remotely or by means of a timer. This is crucial to gauge whether the victims were the intended targets: a timed explosion would be less discriminate than a remotely detonated one.</p> <p>\"We can't rule out that someone placed this bomb to hit this group or one member of it - or it could be simple coincidence,\" the prosecutor's spokesman said.</p> <p>A reward of DM10,000 (\u00a33,150) has been offered for information leading to the arrest of the bombers.</p> <p>A 26-year-old woman lost her unborn child when shrapnel tore into her belly.

      "bodyText": "Suspicions grew yesterday that rightwing extremists had planted the bomb which maimed and terrorised travellers outside a D\u00fcsseldorf railway station on Thursday. It emerged that all nine casualties were immigrants, six of whom were Jews; the other three victims were related by marriage to the six. Germany's interior minister, Otto Schily, said it was reasonable to suspect that the attack was a racist one. \"One can suspect that it could have such a background,\" he said. The bombing will cause deep concern within the German government - only last month ministers received a warning from the security services that the far right was developing \"terrorist\" structures. The attack will also spread dismay among the tens of thousands of Jews who hope to enter Germany under a scheme which accords them preferential treatment over other immigrants. In recent years, some 60,000 Jews have flocked to Germany from eastern Europe and Russia, lured by special entry permits and resettlement facilities. The victims came from Russia, Ukraine and Azerbaijan. They had just left a daily German-language class paid for by the government and were on their way to catch a train to the nearby town of Solingen when they were caught by the blast. The bomb, packed with shrapnel, had been placed on a footbridge leading to the station. A spokesman for the prosecutor's office in D\u00fcsseldorf said: \"We can't rule out any motive, including an anti-foreigner motive.\" Police experts were yesterday trying to reconstruct the explosive device to establish whether it was detonated remotely or by means of a timer. This is crucial to gauge whether the victims were the intended targets: a timed explosion would be less discriminate than a remotely detonated one. \"We can't rule out that someone placed this bomb to hit this group or one member of it - or it could be simple coincidence,\" the prosecutor's spokesman said. A reward of DM10,000 (\u00a33,150) has been offered for information leading to the arrest of the bombers. A 26-year-old woman lost her unborn child when shrapnel tore into her belly. She was five months pregnant. However, doctors at the D\u00fcsseldorf's university hospital managed to reattach her leg, which was almost severed by the explosion. The woman's husband, a 28-year-old economist, was the most seriously injured of the victims. He received wounds to the abdomen and was last night still on the critical list. Michael Szentei-Heife, the director of the Jewish community in D\u00fcsseldorf, said the couple had arrived in Germany last November from Simferopol in central Ukraine. The other victims - five women and two men - suffered shrapnel wounds. Jewish leaders were careful, however, not to predict the outcome of police inquiries. \"We are horrified by this attack on innocent people,\" said Paul Spiegel, the head of Germany's Jewish community. But he said he did not want to comment further until more was known about the reasons for the bombing. Mr Szentei-Heife said it would be difficult to show that anti-semitism, rather than xenophobia, lay behind the maiming of the victims. \"The fact that six out of nine are Jewish puts that into your mind. But, on the other hand, they were not recognisable as Jews,\" he said. Large numbers of eastern Europeans have arrived in Germany since the collapse of communism. But the hostility towards them has been most pronounced in the formerly communist east of the country, where unemployment is high and the presence of cheap labour is deeply resented. D\u00fcsseldorf, by contrast, is one of the most prosperous cities in the west. \"We are shocked that this could occur in D\u00fcsseldorf, a place where these things so far have seemed impossible,\" Mr Szentei-Heife said. \"We are not in the east, the south or the north, where xenophobia is stronger than in the Rhineland, so the shock is that much greater.\"",

So while it's exciting that insurance and reinsurance companies like AIG and Swiss Re are piling into this area, the spotlight should really be on corporate initiatives to shrink carbon emissions. BP Amoco and Shell are de veloping internal carbon trading schemes, making emission reductions cheaper. And the pressure is building on other carbon-heavies: in Australia, Greenpeace just submitted the world's first-ever complaint to a stock exchange about carbon risks. They claim that undisclosed carbon credits could cost Southern Pacific Petroleum and Central Pacific Minerals a thumping 42% of the revenues they expect from a major oil shale project. The game has begun. \u0095 John Elkington is chairman of strategy consultants SustainAbility (www.sustain ability.co.uk) and author of Cannibals With Forks: The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business (Capstone, \u00a312.99).",

      "body": "<p>It may be associated with vicarage garden parties, drinking Pimm's and Alice in Wonderland, but croquet is a sport in which Britain leads the world. Earlier this month, while all eyes were on the Wimbledon finals, a few miles away at the Hurlingham Club in West London, Stephen Mulliner took the crown at the British Open championships. And Britain has won the last four annual world team events.</p> <p>Croquet enthusiasts say the game is growing in popularity. There are around 130 dedicated clubs dotted across the UK with 4,000 members. Many more people of all ages enjoy playing the occasional game in public parks or their gardens, finding it the perfect way to pass a lazy summer afternoon.</p> <p>Nigel Graves, secretary of the Croquet Association, says:\"What goes on at Hurlingham isn't a fair image of the game. Lots of croquet is played in municipally owned spaces. The top players tend to be younger, around the age of 30, although a lot of people take up the game when their knees become too rocky for other things.\"</p> <p>Whether you play once a year or regularly take part in tournaments, croquet is a relatively cheap game to take up. A set containing everything you need - mallets, balls, hoops and winning peg - can be bought for around \u00a3200, while membership of a club costs \u00a350 to \u00a3100.</p> <p>Before rushing out to the nearest lawn though, it is worth being aware that there are two main variations of the game; golf croquet and association croquet. Both are played with two sides, each playing a pair of balls - yellow and red together and black and blue.</p> <p>However with golf croquet, each side takes single alternate shots with their own balls so the game is fast moving and more sociable. The association variation, which is played at most competitions, is tactically more akin to snooker with many shots making a break. A game can take much longer to play, but it is said to be more interesting.</p> <p>Although there is some debate as to the origins of the game, it is generally accepted that John Jaques II introduced modern day croquet into Britain at the Great Exhibition of 1851. One hundred and fifty years later, a firm called Jaques is still making croquet equipment. A good quality set such as the Oxford (\u00a3399) comes in a natural pine box and includes four ash mallets with brass rings which add weight and protect against damage. Thankfully, a set of rules is also included.</p> <p>A more basic set, ideal for playing in the garden, is the Richmond at \u00a3160. For those who like to swing their mallets in only the finest style, there is the eight-player Sandringham set (\u00a32,495). Everything you need is contained in the mahogany box, including a \"smasher\" to knock the hoops and peg into the grass.</p> <p>Townsend Croquet also produces a wide range of sets. Its basic garden set costs \u00a399, while the tournament standard Championship set is \u00a3595.</p> <p>Serious players, though, may want to select a mallet that suits their particular style of playing. This could either be made from the traditional hardwood lignum vitae or a modern one with a fibreglass shaft and cast aluminium heads.</p> <p>The Croquet Association naturally sells a wide range, including the respected Jaques Hurlingham mallet (\u00a385 approx) or, for the same price, their speciality the Hogan, which is imported from New Zealand.</p> <p>Customised mallets are also available. There are a number of bespoke mallet makers who will construct and adapt to suit your playing idiosyncrasies. John Hobbs, which made the mallet for the winner in last year's Open, for example, offers a whole range of variations from weight, stiffness and length to a handle that can be rotated in the head to improve accuracy. Prices start at \u00a3125.</p> <p>If the whole point of the game for you is to conjure up the spirit of croquet's Victorian heyday, think about investing in an antique set with round-headed mallets rather than the modern day square heads. A shop such as Sean Arnold, which specialises in antique sports equipment, sells them, although they are very much in demand and go quickly. For example, it recently sold a 100-year-old set with its original antique pine box for \u00a3750 - the value very much depending on having the original box with the manufacturer's name on it.</p> <p>Another garden game, although lacking the social cachet of croquet, is quoits. It was rumoured that Queen Elizabeth I was banned from playing because the game was deemed too vulgar. The traditional event, which is often played in pubs, uses heavy steel rings (2.4kg) that are thrown at a stake buried in the ground.</p> <p>Masters Games sells blacksmith forged rings for \u00a357 a pair, as well as a garden-friendly sets made from rubber. Jacques also has a set for \u00a317 that uses rope quoits and a frame with five hardwood pegs.</p> <p>One of the simplest games to play in the garden is boules. All you do is throw larger balls at the smaller jack. Cheap versions of the game can be found in supermarkets, but it is best to buy a French-made set such as those sold by Brighton shop A Lot of Gaul, which has sets ranging from \u00a315 to \u00a375.</p> <p>If you want to participate in something a touch more intellectual in the garden, look out for an outdoor chess set. Garden chess produces setzs that fit into the space of four flagstones on a patio, or all-weather sets for the lawn for \u00a3250.</p> <p><b> Rules and the kit as you take to the lawns</b></p> <p>A standard croquet court measures 53 yards by 28 yards. A wooden peg stands in the centre of the court. Six iron hoops are at designated places on the court.</p> <p>These are 12 inches high and must be no more than 4 inches wide. Each player has a long-handled mallet around three feet in length.</p> <p>The basic idea is to get your side's two balls - black and blue or red and yellow - twice around the six-hoop course to finish off against the middle peg. This last bit is known as \"pegging out\" - a term that has of course passed into common usage. The variations of the game are:</p> <p><b> Association croquet</b><br></p> <p>Each side takes alternate turns (in a specified order) but each turn may consist of many shots. Every time the ball runs through a hoop in the correct order or hits another ball (called roquet) on the lawn, they earn additional shots, much the same as a snooker player does.</p> <p>Skilful play can lead to scoring several hoops in one turn. The winner is the side who manages to score all the hoops and hit the peg first.</p> <p><b> Golf croquet</b><br></p> <p>Each side takes alternate shots with the aim of running their ball through the hoops in a specified order. Once one player has scored a particular hoop, all players proceed to the next one. The winner is the one that scores the most hoops.</p> <p>\u0095 Detailed rules are available from the Croquet Association.</p> <p><b>Who to call</b></p> <p>Croquet Association, tel: 020-7736-3148, <a href=\"http://www.croquet.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.croquet.org.uk </a></p> <p>Jaques, tel: 020-8684-4242; also available from <a href=\"http://www.simplysports.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.simplysports.co.uk </a></p> <p>John Hobbs: <a href=\"http://members.aol.com/hobbsmall\" target=\"_NEW\">aol.com/hobbsmall </a></p> <p>Townsend Croquet, tel: 01255-424247</p> <p>Sean Arnold, tel: 020-7221-2267</p> <p>Garden Chess: <a href=\"http://wkweb5.cableinet.co.uk/miketasker\" target=\"_NEW\">cableinet.co.uk/miketasker</a></p> <p>Masters Games: 020-8288-2604, <a href=\"http://www.mastersgames.com/\" target=\"_NEW\">www.mastersgames.com </a></p> <p>A Lot of Gaul: <a href=\"http://www.gaul.co.uk  \" target=\"_NEW\">www.gaul.co.uk </a></p>",

Earlier this month, while all eyes were on the Wimbledon finals, a few miles away at the Hurlingham Club in West London, Stephen Mulliner took the crown at the British Open championships. And Britain has won the last four annual world team events. Croquet enthusiasts say the game is growing in popularity. There are around 130 dedicated clubs dotted across the UK with 4,000 members. Many more people of all ages enjoy playing the occasional game in public parks or their gardens, finding it the perfect way to pass a lazy summer afternoon. Nigel Graves, secretary of the Croquet Association, says:\"What goes on at Hurlingham isn't a fair image of the game. Lots of croquet is played in municipally owned spaces. The top players tend to be younger, around the age of 30, although a lot of people take up the game when their knees become too rocky for other things.\" Whether you play once a year or regularly take part in tournaments, croquet is a relatively cheap game to take up. A set containing everything you need - mallets, balls, hoops and winning peg - can be bought for around \u00a3200, while membership of a club costs \u00a350 to \u00a3100. Before rushing out to the nearest lawn though, it is worth being aware that there are two main variations of the game; golf croquet and association croquet. Both are played with two sides, each playing a pair of balls - yellow and red together and black and blue. However with golf croquet, each side takes single alternate shots with their own balls so the game is fast moving and more sociable. The association variation, which is played at most competitions, is tactically more akin to snooker with many shots making a break. A game can take much longer to play, but it is said to be more interesting. Although there is some debate as to the origins of the game, it is generally accepted that John Jaques II introduced modern day croquet into Britain at the Great Exhibition of 1851. One hundred and fifty years later, a firm called Jaques is still making croquet equipment. A good quality set such as the Oxford (\u00a3399) comes in a natural pine box and includes four ash mallets with brass rings which add weight and protect against damage. Thankfully, a set of rules is also included. A more basic set, ideal for playing in the garden, is the Richmond at \u00a3160. For those who like to swing their mallets in only the finest style, there is the eight-player Sandringham set (\u00a32,495). Everything you need is contained in the mahogany box, including a \"smasher\" to knock the hoops and peg into the grass. Townsend Croquet also produces a wide range of sets. Its basic garden set costs \u00a399, while the tournament standard Championship set is \u00a3595. Serious players, though, may want to select a mallet that suits their particular style of playing. This could either be made from the traditional hardwood lignum vitae or a modern one with a fibreglass shaft and cast aluminium heads. The Croquet Association naturally sells a wide range, including the respected Jaques Hurlingham mallet (\u00a385 approx) or, for the same price, their speciality the Hogan, which is imported from New Zealand. Customised mallets are also available. There are a number of bespoke mallet makers who will construct and adapt to suit your playing idiosyncrasies. John Hobbs, which made the mallet for the winner in last year's Open, for example, offers a whole range of variations from weight, stiffness and length to a handle that can be rotated in the head to improve accuracy. Prices start at \u00a3125. If the whole point of the game for you is to conjure up the spirit of croquet's Victorian heyday, think about investing in an antique set with round-headed mallets rather than the modern day square heads. A shop such as Sean Arnold, which specialises in antique sports equipment, sells them, although they are very much in demand and go quickly. For example, it recently sold a 100-year-old set with its original antique pine box for \u00a3750 - the value very much depending on having the original box with the manufacturer's name on it. Another garden game, although lacking the social cachet of croquet, is quoits. It was rumoured that Queen Elizabeth I was banned from playing because the game was deemed too vulgar. The traditional event, which is often played in pubs, uses heavy steel rings (2.4kg) that are thrown at a stake buried in the ground. Masters Games sells blacksmith forged rings for \u00a357 a pair, as well as a garden-friendly sets made from rubber. Jacques also has a set for \u00a317 that uses rope quoits and a frame with five hardwood pegs. One of the simplest games to play in the garden is boules. All you do is throw larger balls at the smaller jack. Cheap versions of the game can be found in supermarkets, but it is best to buy a French-made set such as those sold by Brighton shop A Lot of Gaul, which has sets ranging from \u00a315 to \u00a375. If you want to participate in something a touch more intellectual in the garden, look out for an outdoor chess set. Garden chess produces setzs that fit into the space of four flagstones on a patio, or all-weather sets for the lawn for \u00a3250. Rules and the kit as you take to the lawns A standard croquet court measures 53 yards by 28 yards. A wooden peg stands in the centre of the court. Six iron hoops are at designated places on the court. These are 12 inches high and must be no more than 4 inches wide. Each player has a long-handled mallet around three feet in length. The basic idea is to get your side's two balls - black and blue or red and yellow - twice around the six-hoop course to finish off against the middle peg. This last bit is known as \"pegging out\" - a term that has of course passed into common usage. The variations of the game are: Association croquet Each side takes alternate turns (in a specified order) but each turn may consist of many shots. Every time the ball runs through a hoop in the correct order or hits another ball (called roquet) on the lawn, they earn additional shots, much the same as a snooker player does. Skilful play can lead to scoring several hoops in one turn. The winner is the side who manages to score all the hoops and hit the peg first. Golf croquet Each side takes alternate shots with the aim of running their ball through the hoops in a specified order. Once one player has scored a particular hoop, all players proceed to the next one. The winner is the one that scores the most hoops. \u0095 Detailed rules are available from the Croquet Association.

      "body": "<p>You buy the unpolished vegetables, your child will only eat Baby Organix bread sticks, your dog's developed a taste for Yarrah's organic chicken chunks and you are seriously considering switching your mortgage to an ethical lender. So why not complete the holistic dream and develop an organic career? </p> <p>As the demand for organic products increases, so do the job opportunities. But does it mean embracing an organic, salary? Or, like the organic fruit and veg that is sold at a premium, does it follow that an eco career could deliver premium rewards? </p> <p>\"The basic salary is exactly the same, but the annual profit share is not,\" says Susan Cooper, a loan manager at Triodos, the Bristol-based bank which invests exclusively in organisations and businesses with social and environmental objectives. </p> <p>Ms Cooper worked at Barclays for more than 20 years so she's in a good position to compare traditional with green. \"The pressures are different. I'm probably working harder here, but as we don't have sales targets, there's more time for customers.\" </p> <p>The job interview methods differ, too. Whereas Barclays went in for lengthy form filling and relied heavily on psychometric testing, her new employer's emphasis was on whether she would fit in with \"the Triodos way of working\". </p> <p>Which is? \"Instead of being told what to do, you're asked your opinion,\" she explains. And what of the working environment? \"We're not in a whizzy eco-building, although they've got one in our Dutch office, in Zeist; we're in a Georgian Merchants House, overlooking the Downs. And there's no fluorescent lighting,\" she says. </p> <p>Everyone at Triodos is, unsurprisingly, known as a \"co-worker\" and, according to Susan Cooper, the opportunities are less about motoring towards the end of year bonus, and more about \"being able to marry the finance side with positive activities\". These can range from lending money to businesses such as Cafedirect and the Organic Milk Suppliers Co-operative, and a host of other green, urban regeneration and community projects. </p> <p>But does an organic career mean wearing Birkenstocks full-time, reprinting your CV on hemp and moving lock, stock, and barrel to Totnes? </p> <p>The Totnes part helps. William and Gabriela Lana moved to Devon three years ago to set up the Green- fibreshop, in addition to their mail order business, which sells clothes made from organic cotton. \"I'm sure in myself that this is the way to go forward,\" says Mr Lana, whose business recently turned the corner from the red into the black. \"Although it's still very new. It's a bit like organic food was 10 years ago. And you have to give people an explanation as to why there's a 20% premium.\" </p> <p>What of the clothes? \"Our products do not look like anything other than mainstream products,\" says Mr Lana. \"We've got a men's button-down shirt with coconut shell buttons which looks as if it could have come from Next.\" </p> <p>And just as organic food used to be found only in health food shops but is now stocked by all supermarkets, Mr Lana believes that once the high street clothing retailers start to stock products made from organic cotton, consumers will start to make different choices about what they wear. He says: \"M&amp;S started selling an organic cotton line.\" Organic knickers? \"But they didn't really go very well and they withdrew the line with no explanation.\" </p> <p>Perhaps it's still early days. And Mr Lana is not without his competitors. Linda Row studied fashion at St Martin's and knew she wanted to do business \"in a different way\" which motivated her to set up Clothworks three years ago. </p> <p>\"The way that cotton is produced, using large amounts of chemicals isn't really sustainable as, after a while, the pests become immune to the pesticides,\" she explains. Mixing hemp with wool and silk, Ms Row gets lots of interest from students who, she believes, will create \"a new generation of designers\". </p> <p>Soon to be stocking Clothworks clothes is the Organic Cafe Natural Home Store, opening in Notting Hill, London, later this year. Other products on offer will be organic paint, wooden toys, and eco-furniture. Farewell Ikea? \"I hope so,\" says Carol Charlton Jones, who is behind the new shop. \"It's a made-to-last concept. And I think the future lies in people having to change their view of how and where they purchase.\" </p> <p>As organic suppliers step up their production to meet the demands from the supermarkets, some of the homespun businesses are having to change - and recruit differently. </p> <p>Rachel's Dairy, in Aberystwyth, may sound like two people pottering about in a cowshed, but is in fact a family business which has just been bought by Horizon. And that isn't a holiday company, but a US business set up by health food specialists. </p> <p>The newest recruit is Anahita Belanger, who has defected from Procter &amp;Gamble where she managed the Sainsbury's account: selling Pampers and Wash &amp; Go. As she was brought up on an organic farm herself, she sees Rachel's as a \"good ethical fit\". She's now national account manager, selling organic wholemilk yoghurt with maple syrup to the likes of Waitrose, Safeway and or ganic supermarkets Fresh and Wild. \"Before I joined, no one person was dealing with the multiples,\" she explains. Although she has only been with Rachel's Dairy for a couple of weeks, she believes the working culture to be \"less competitive\" than P&amp;G. </p> <p>Yet as the demand for organic food increases, won't competition impact on the working culture within the individual organisations? And as the organisations grow, how can you maintain a green and friendly working environment? </p> <p>Two years ago, the Soil Association employed 40 people. They now have 130 people in their Bristol offices. </p> <p>\"We're developing new systems to deal with growth,\" says Mike Collins, who adds that there is a huge demand for people with marketing, campaigning and IT skills combined with an understanding of the aims of the Soil Association. </p> <p>Inevitably, too, the organic market is opening up opportunities for savvy, green consultants. And it's a long term thing - which, for consultancy fees is even better. </p> <p>Robert Weston set up Groundswell, \"a communications and culture change consultancy around sustainability\" in Bath. A graduate of the MSc in Responsibility &amp; Business Practice at the University of Bath (in partnership with the New Academy of Business), Robert Weston sees more and more green consultancy opportunities opening up. </p> <p>\"The name Groundswell seems to be living up to its name,\" he says, explaining that many of his former clients from his days as a mainstream consultant: the likes of Ford and Wrangler, are now becoming clients again as he works in collaboration with their sustainability departments. </p> <p>Other agencies which are growing include the Soho-based Good Business, which helps mainstream clients such as Nike, Coca-Cola and NatWest to tackle their marketing through addressing social issues; and C21, also in London, which specialises in ethical, environmental and educational communication. </p> <p>Indeed, if all organisations are beginning to take steps to deal with social and green issues and are finding ways of integrating them into their businesses does it mean that if you just stay put and hang around long enough, your mainstream employer will start to feel as clean as a whistle? </p> <p>\"Instead of the niche being made up of the goodies, it'll be the baddies,\" agrees Alex MacGillivray, deputy director of the New Economics Foundation. </p> <p>\"And there'll be lots of career opportunities for brokers: the kind of people who are doing the Bristol Breakfast (an ethical breakfast made up of locally sourced products and fairly traded coffee and bananas). And there's bound to be an 'Ask Ethical Jeeves' website,\" he predicts. </p> <p>So you know what to do. Either sit tight and wait for things to change or, if you're what Alex MacGillivray describes as an \"early adopter\" you can hit the organic fast track. Move to the West Country.

      "body": "<p>There is something quite silly about asking Britain's leading banks to contribute to a piece of social infrastructure in the form of a post office-based \"universal bank\" and then turning around and saying that if they don't like the idea they can just set up their own socially responsible divisions and forget the post offices. </p> <p>Banks are like other businesses in that they try to avoid funding competitors. They see the government's request for them to pay the bulk of the universal bank's annual costs as no more than a subsidy to the Post Office, which is keen to move into the personal finance field - albeit at the low end of the market. </p> <p>They now have a way out which will prove much cheaper - by simply devising appropriate basic accounts for those who have fought shy of the banking system and then advertising them widely. </p> <p>We can expect the take-up to be limited because bank branches tend to be thin on the ground in those areas where the \"unbanked\" live and work - rural areas or rough parts of town. </p> <p>The beauty of the post office-based scheme shows through in one statistic: there are post offices in 60% of villages and banks in only 5%. </p> <p>This whole fiasco seems to have arisen because of in-fighting between the Treasury and the department of trade and industry. The former simply wants to end financial exclusion and get benefits paid out in a more efficient manner. The latter is seeking ways of replacing the earnings the post offices will lose through the decision to pay benefits directly into bank accounts by 2003. </p> <p>This is a fine example of unjoined-up government. </p> <p><strong> Green with envy </strong><br> </p> <p>It could almost be read as an act of spite: Lord Hollick turning on his fair weather friend, deciding that if he was not going to be able to play at being a meeja baron then he would do his damnedest to make sure that that Michael Green will lose his title as well. </p> <p>There were rumours, of course, before Stephen Byers' regulatory nail bomb a month ago, killing the proposed merger of Lord Hollick's United News &amp; Media and Mr Green's Carlton Communications, that tensions between the two men were rising fast. </p> <p>The chatter was denied at the time and was probably misguided in any case. But the effect of yesterday's deal to sell United's choice TV bits to Charles Allen's Granada Media is to leave Mr Green in the weakest possible position. </p> <p>If Granada had been forced to pursue a risky hostile takeover of United, even victory might have left it weaker, burning cash and management time. </p> <p>Instead, Mr Allen has been able to pay for the three franchise assets substantially with Granada paper, leaving a group that will be capitalised at something just north of \u00a310bn. It will also have more than \u00a31.5bn of cash in the bank to put down as a deposit on the next acquisition or strategic partnership - which we must presume will be in mainland Europe. </p> <p>Of course, Carlton is not history. Mr Green can look forward to all sorts of fun swapping assets with Mr Allen: stakes in Scottish Media Group and Meridian are all in play as well as the HTV and GMTV assets. But his apparently passive behaviour in recent weeks seems strange, especially when set against the vibrancy and vision this man displayed throughout the 1990s. </p> <p>Maybe Mr Green has just been a bit under the weather at an irritating time.

      "bodyText": "There is something quite silly about asking Britain's leading banks to contribute to a piece of social infrastructure in the form of a post office-based \"universal bank\" and then turning around and saying that if they don't like the idea they can just set up their own socially responsible divisions and forget the post offices. Banks are like other businesses in that they try to avoid funding competitors. They see the government's request for them to pay the bulk of the universal bank's annual costs as no more than a subsidy to the Post Office, which is keen to move into the personal finance field - albeit at the low end of the market. They now have a way out which will prove much cheaper - by simply devising appropriate basic accounts for those who have fought shy of the banking system and then advertising them widely. We can expect the take-up to be limited because bank branches tend to be thin on the ground in those areas where the \"unbanked\" live and work - rural areas or rough parts of town. The beauty of the post office-based scheme shows through in one statistic: there are post offices in 60% of villages and banks in only 5%. This whole fiasco seems to have arisen because of in-fighting between the Treasury and the department of trade and industry. The former simply wants to end financial exclusion and get benefits paid out in a more efficient manner. The latter is seeking ways of replacing the earnings the post offices will lose through the decision to pay benefits directly into bank accounts by 2003. This is a fine example of unjoined-up government. Green with envy It could almost be read as an act of spite: Lord Hollick turning on his fair weather friend, deciding that if he was not going to be able to play at being a meeja baron then he would do his damnedest to make sure that that Michael Green will lose his title as well. There were rumours, of course, before Stephen Byers' regulatory nail bomb a month ago, killing the proposed merger of Lord Hollick's United News &amp; Media and Mr Green's Carlton Communications, that tensions between the two men were rising fast. The chatter was denied at the time and was probably misguided in any case. But the effect of yesterday's deal to sell United's choice TV bits to Charles Allen's Granada Media is to leave Mr Green in the weakest possible position. If Granada had been forced to pursue a risky hostile takeover of United, even victory might have left it weaker, burning cash and management time. Instead, Mr Allen has been able to pay for the three franchise assets substantially with Granada paper, leaving a group that will be capitalised at something just north of \u00a310bn. It will also have more than \u00a31.5bn of cash in the bank to put down as a deposit on the next acquisition or strategic partnership - which we must presume will be in mainland Europe. Of course, Carlton is not history. Mr Green can look forward to all sorts of fun swapping assets with Mr Allen: stakes in Scottish Media Group and Meridian are all in play as well as the HTV and GMTV assets. But his apparently passive behaviour in recent weeks seems strange, especially when set against the vibrancy and vision this man displayed throughout the 1990s. Maybe Mr Green has just been a bit under the weather at an irritating time. If so, he should try some of the rocket fuel which Mr Allen has clearly been pouring on his breakfast over the past three months. Late opening After a rare period on the back foot, Lloyds TSB is once again setting an example for its peers.

But not the Consumers' Association. Its director, Sheila McKechnie says: \"We are staggered the FSA has allowed Axa to give so much money to shareholders. This deal is scandalous.\" Must I accept this deal? No. If you vote \"no\" you will retain your rights over the orphan estate until your policy matures. You'll lose the cash windfall, but keep your entitlement to future distributions from the estate - even if 99.9% of other policyholders have voted for jam today rather than tomorrow. But Axa says there can be no distributions until 2006 at least, so, under the terms of this deal, anybody with a plan maturing before then should vote for the cash. Will the payout weaken the company? No, says Axa. Its existing financial strength will be maintained, with the initial \u00a3300m bonus financed from shareholders', not policyholders', funds. I'm not with Axa but my life company has an orphan estate. Will I get a windfall? There's lots of speculation about \u00a320bn locked in orphan estates, about to produce another cascade of payouts. But expectations were dashed when it was made clear that the Axa deal is not a blueprint for other distributions. Each one has to be separately negotiated, and the negotiations can take many years. Who are the other companies with orphan estates? Prudential is the biggest, with \u00a38bn in orphan assets. CGNU has \u00a35bn, L&amp;G \u00a32.3bn, Britannic \u00a32bn, Clerical Medical \u00a31.9bn and Pearl \u00a31.5bn.",

      "body": "<p>Warnings by former Saudi energy minister Sheik Yamani that the world is nearing the end of the oil era had few rushing out to buy electric cars. But a more potent symbol of pending decline for the industry appeared this week: BP, the company which started the Middle East oil boom early this century, said its name in future would signify \"beyond petroleum\" rather than British Petroleum. </p> <p>Chief executive Sir John Browne plans to spend \u00a3100m over the next 12 months reinforcing this image with a new logo, a makeover for its petrol stations and a media advertising blitz. </p> <p>So what is wrong with being an oil company? Quite a lot, it would seem from the adverse reaction to BP daring to spend a lot of money on a marketing makeover. </p> <p>The road lobby has been up in arms, complaining that the cash should have been used for lowering petrol station prices. The green lobby has been up in arms complaining its all a cynical ploy. </p> <p>Environmentalists say BP is rooted in the hydrocarbon field - and no amount of rebranding can hide that. The fact that BP has chosen a new logo which looks like a sunflower just adds insult to injury for the eco-warriors. </p> <p>So why did BP do it? The official version from its headquarters at Britannic House is that it reflects the growing interest in cleaner, more environmentally friendly fuels such as natural gas and solar power. </p> <p>It is certainly true that since the recent takeover of Amoco, BP has become a major gas producer. It is also true that BP has become a world leader in the development of solar power, even though the amount of money being spent is insignificant compared to its oil exploration. </p> <p>But Sir John also has ambitions outside of the energy field, and the logo could as much be used to front an office cleaning company or a supermarket chain as it could a hydrocarbon group. </p> <p>In fact a supermarket chain is on the way because the oil major has plans to open up retail outlets at all its major petrol stations as part of ambitions to increase retail revenues by 10%. </p> <p>But underneath all the hype is thought to be an acceptance that the traditional image of the oil company has become a negative one in the hearts and minds of the consumer. </p> <p>Its not just the high petrol prices that are the problem. There is also a growing demand throughout the business sector for a social and ethical dimension in all that is done. </p> <p>On a more mundane level, the oil companies are aware that one petrol is the same as any other, making it nearly impossible to build brand loyalty. Then there is the fact that BP was 58th in a recent survey by consultant Interbrand on globally recognised product names. </p> <p>But is the makeover a grossly cynical exercise to pull the wool over its environmental critics and retail customers alike? No, it is good business practice, and is being done by every truly successful brand around the world, says Robert Jones, a director at consultant Wolff Olins. </p> <p>Think of Starbucks, Disney or Virgin. These brands are despised by a few but liked by millions. In a market filled with coffee bars, Starbucks stands for sociability as well as beverages. </p> <p>Disney stands for much more than cartoons and theme parks. It stands for fun - while Sir Richard Branson's Virgin is nothing if not youthful and iconoclastic. It can sell anything its founder comes up with - records, airlines, financial services, mobile phones and even energy. </p> <p>So BP is not mistaken in spending all that cash on rebranding, but it does raise the question of whether the message is correct. Saying BP stands for \"beyond petroleum\" points people in an interesting direction but does not explain what they will find there - or even exactly what BP now stands for, says Mr Jones. </p> <p>The challenge over the next few years will be to fine tune the message so that consumers understand what idea they are buying into - and having set a new standard delivering on that. </p> <p>Consumers do not like to be let down. Nike is seen as a brand that represents more than shoes; it represents winning. Allegations that it was using low-cost labour from poor countries nearly damaged the company's name. </p> <p>BP is engaged in some of the most politically sensitive countries in the world, such as Colombia, where it has been accused by charities of not doing enough to halt human rights abuses. </p> <p>Plans to drill in environmentally sensitive areas such as the Arctic have also led to its annual general meetings being logjammed by protests from green-fingered shareholders. </p> <p>But BP has so far managed to walk the tightrope between making spectacular financial gains and being seen by the wider community as a company that cares for both customers and employees. </p> <p>Although it has made large numbers of redundancies after taking over first Amoco, then Arco and then Burmah Castrol, it has done so by awarding generous financial packages. </p> <p>Sir John stresses that the bright new green and yellow logo is as much geared to inspiring people inside the organisation as outside. He has raised expectations that must be met. </p> <p><strong>The fax</strong></p> <p><strong> BP's roots</strong> go back to a concession to explore for oil in Persia granted to a syndicate led by wealthy Englishman, William Knox D'Arcy, in 1901 </p> <p><strong> The syndicate</strong> , later to be known as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, ran short of money and was rescued by the Burmah Oil Company </p> <p><strong> Burmah</strong> gave up its BP shares as part of a Bank of England rescue deal in the 1970s. BP made a successful takeover bid for its former saviour earlier this year</p>",

Its not just the high petrol prices that are the problem. There is also a growing demand throughout the business sector for a social and ethical dimension in all that is done. On a more mundane level, the oil companies are aware that one petrol is the same as any other, making it nearly impossible to build brand loyalty. Then there is the fact that BP was 58th in a recent survey by consultant Interbrand on globally recognised product names. But is the makeover a grossly cynical exercise to pull the wool over its environmental critics and retail customers alike? No, it is good business practice, and is being done by every truly successful brand around the world, says Robert Jones, a director at consultant Wolff Olins. Think of Starbucks, Disney or Virgin. These brands are despised by a few but liked by millions. In a market filled with coffee bars, Starbucks stands for sociability as well as beverages. Disney stands for much more than cartoons and theme parks. It stands for fun - while Sir Richard Branson's Virgin is nothing if not youthful and iconoclastic. It can sell anything its founder comes up with - records, airlines, financial services, mobile phones and even energy. So BP is not mistaken in spending all that cash on rebranding, but it does raise the question of whether the message is correct. Saying BP stands for \"beyond petroleum\" points people in an interesting direction but does not explain what they will find there - or even exactly what BP now stands for, says Mr Jones. The challenge over the next few years will be to fine tune the message so that consumers understand what idea they are buying into - and having set a new standard delivering on that. Consumers do not like to be let down. Nike is seen as a brand that represents more than shoes; it represents winning. Allegations that it was using low-cost labour from poor countries nearly damaged the company's name. BP is engaged in some of the most politically sensitive countries in the world, such as Colombia, where it has been accused by charities of not doing enough to halt human rights abuses. Plans to drill in environmentally sensitive areas such as the Arctic have also led to its annual general meetings being logjammed by protests from green-fingered shareholders. But BP has so far managed to walk the tightrope between making spectacular financial gains and being seen by the wider community as a company that cares for both customers and employees. Although it has made large numbers of redundancies after taking over first Amoco, then Arco and then Burmah Castrol, it has done so by awarding generous financial packages. Sir John stresses that the bright new green and yellow logo is as much geared to inspiring people inside the organisation as outside. He has raised expectations that must be met. The fax BP's roots go back to a concession to explore for oil in Persia granted to a syndicate led by wealthy Englishman, William Knox D'Arcy, in 1901 The syndicate , later to be known as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, ran short of money and was rescued by the Burmah Oil Company Burmah gave up its BP shares as part of a Bank of England rescue deal in the 1970s. BP made a successful takeover bid for its former saviour earlier this year",

      "bodyText": "Your report on our study (TV shows panned for third world coverage, July 28), does not do justice to its contents. It does not conclude that \"holiday programmes concentrate on holidays\". In the largest study of its kind ever attempted, we showed the impact of images of the developing world on the beliefs and understanding of viewers. This had crucial implications not just for public attitudes to development, aid, and the debt crisis but also for domestic issues such as race and migration. The study showed a profound level of unease amongst many viewers that they simply did not understand the world in which they lived and that TV and press coverage were the source of much of the confusion: a ratings-driven media focused increasingly on disasters, celebrities and eye-catching events, without explanation or context. The study has led to a series of initiatives with journalists and researchers working together to find new ways to give more informed coverage of the developing world.

Experience has shown that when people have the chance to become literate in their own language, the transition to regional and/or national language is not hard to bridge. Can more consideration be given to this by G8 policy-makers? Dr Clinton Robinson High Wycombe, Bucks",

Mr Byers turned down its application last November because it would have broken the moratorium. </p> <p>Welcoming the decision, Rhodri Morgan, the Welsh first secretary, said it would save 600 jobs at Anglesey Aluminium and Great Lakes Chemicals, two of the biggest employers on an island hit by unemployment. </p> <p>The DTI insisted that the Rhosgoch decision was exceptional and had been made on economic and environmental grounds. The station is to be powered by gas brought in from Liverpool Bay which is said to be ecologically friendly. </p> <p>But the move is likely to lead to renewals of the around two dozen applications for gas-fired stations held up by the moratorium imposed in late 1997 to protect the British coal industry, which was then undergoing a periodic crisis. </p> <p>The moratorium is scheduled to be formally lifted on November 21, when the new electricity trading arrangements for the wholesale market should come into force, although there is scepticism in the industry that the IT systems will be ready. </p> <p>Callum McCarthy, the energy regulator, said last week he saw no reason why the target date could not be met, and that the IT systems were expected to go live on August 14. </p> <p>According to the government's annual energy statistics, published yesterday, gas accounted for 38.5% of Britain's power generation last year, compared with 15% in 1994.

      "bodyText": "The government has breached its own moratorium on new gas-fired power stations by giving the go-ahead for a combined heat and power plant on Anglesey - paving the way for an official lifting of the ban later this year. Trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers has bowed to pressure from the national assembly for Wales in allowing Burlington Resources to build a 560MW gas-fired station at Rhosgoch. Mr Byers turned down its application last November because it would have broken the moratorium. Welcoming the decision, Rhodri Morgan, the Welsh first secretary, said it would save 600 jobs at Anglesey Aluminium and Great Lakes Chemicals, two of the biggest employers on an island hit by unemployment. The DTI insisted that the Rhosgoch decision was exceptional and had been made on economic and environmental grounds. The station is to be powered by gas brought in from Liverpool Bay which is said to be ecologically friendly. But the move is likely to lead to renewals of the around two dozen applications for gas-fired stations held up by the moratorium imposed in late 1997 to protect the British coal industry, which was then undergoing a periodic crisis. The moratorium is scheduled to be formally lifted on November 21, when the new electricity trading arrangements for the wholesale market should come into force, although there is scepticism in the industry that the IT systems will be ready. Callum McCarthy, the energy regulator, said last week he saw no reason why the target date could not be met, and that the IT systems were expected to go live on August 14. According to the government's annual energy statistics, published yesterday, gas accounted for 38.5% of Britain's power generation last year, compared with 15% in 1994. Coal's share sank to 28% from 48% five years before. Renewables accounted for 2.8% compared with 1.5% in 1994 and Helen Liddell, the energy minister, said the industry was on course to meet targets of 5% by 2003 and 10% by 2010. A former National Power station in Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire - now up for sale - could be converted to \"renewable\" energy. The station was closed in 1998 after National Power abandoned a \u00a3500m plan to convert the oil-fired plant to orimulsion, the so-called dirty fuel, in the face of environmental objections. Separately, Texaco is to invest \u00a344m in its Pembroke oil refinery to bring ultra-low sulphur petrol on stream.

An initial payment of \u00a36m will be made on completion of the purchase from Touchbase Group and other shareholders, while two further payments will depend on future revenues.

      "body": "<p>Much moralising accompanied the House of Lords' refusal to repeal section 28 this week. Lady Young claimed that to oppose repeal was to \"speak up for parents and children\". Lady Blatch saw repeal as a wedge's thin end: trans-sexual marriages and adoptions, lowering the gay age of consent, and in general \"relaxing the laws\", as she said with a shudder, \"as they relate to gays and lesbians and for people cruising on our public roads for sex\". She thereby illustrated how section 28's supporters think: it is their Vietnam, the place where the rot must be stopped. </p> <p>Section 28 outlaws the \"promotion\" of homosexuality in schools by local authorities. No prosecution has even been initiated under its terms, and local authorities no longer run schools. Supporters of section 28 are therefore making a purely symbolic gesture in retaining it. It is their way of manifesting hostility to lifestyles they personally dislike, and of trying to impose instead a traditionalist fantasy of \"family morality\" to which they cling for equally personal reasons. They claim to represent the majority of public opinion - an unreliable beast that few of them would wish to represent on other questions - but that is a dishonest manoeuvre. Their true motives are explained by the fact that they are nothing more or less than a highly questionable form of mallophage which infests the body politic: viz moralisers. </p> <p>When the body politic is immune to moralisers they merely appear comical - as prigs and curmudgeons, who complain and blame, stamping their feet and waving umbrellas in outrage at whatever is different from themselves - or whatever comes too close to their own guilty desires.

      "bodyText": "Much moralising accompanied the House of Lords' refusal to repeal section 28 this week. Lady Young claimed that to oppose repeal was to \"speak up for parents and children\". Lady Blatch saw repeal as a wedge's thin end: trans-sexual marriages and adoptions, lowering the gay age of consent, and in general \"relaxing the laws\", as she said with a shudder, \"as they relate to gays and lesbians and for people cruising on our public roads for sex\". She thereby illustrated how section 28's supporters think: it is their Vietnam, the place where the rot must be stopped. Section 28 outlaws the \"promotion\" of homosexuality in schools by local authorities. No prosecution has even been initiated under its terms, and local authorities no longer run schools. Supporters of section 28 are therefore making a purely symbolic gesture in retaining it. It is their way of manifesting hostility to lifestyles they personally dislike, and of trying to impose instead a traditionalist fantasy of \"family morality\" to which they cling for equally personal reasons. They claim to represent the majority of public opinion - an unreliable beast that few of them would wish to represent on other questions - but that is a dishonest manoeuvre. Their true motives are explained by the fact that they are nothing more or less than a highly questionable form of mallophage which infests the body politic: viz moralisers. When the body politic is immune to moralisers they merely appear comical - as prigs and curmudgeons, who complain and blame, stamping their feet and waving umbrellas in outrage at whatever is different from themselves - or whatever comes too close to their own guilty desires. When the body politic is not immune to them they are a menace, causing not just general inflammation and irritation in society, but downright misery to the people whose ways of life are different from their own. A moraliser is a person who seeks to impose upon others his view of how they should live and behave. Everyone is entitled to a view about what counts as acceptable behaviour, and everyone is entitled to put it forward as eloquently and forcefully as he can. But moralisers go much further.

His immaculate technical command was legendary, and his lyrical playing was distinguished by a luscious warmth and highly expressive intonation. His musical memory was staggering; he could play entire passages of an orchestral score on the violin.</p> <p>Born to Russian immigrant parents in Philadelphia, Shumsky began studying the violin at the age of three. His outstanding talent was recognised early, and, in an era of such remarkable prodigies as Yehudi Menuhin, Ruggiero Ricci and Guila Bustabo, he held his own.</p> <p>After playing to Leopold Stokowski, the conductor pronounced the young violinist \"the most astounding genius I have ever heard\", and, in 1925, invited Shumsky to appear as soloist with the Philadelphia Orchestra in Mozart's Violin Concerto No 5 in A major. Later that year, Shumsky began studying privately in New York with the renowned violin pedagogue Leopold Auer, who had taught Heifetz, Elman, Milstein and Efrem Zimbalist, father of the film star.</p> <p>As a child, Shumsky performed several hundred concerts, often appearing with the pianist and conductor Ernest Schelling, the founder of a series of young people's symphony concerts. On one occasion, Schelling arranged for Shumsky to play to Fritz Kreisler. After performing several pieces, he gave the great Austrian violinist a surprise by playing Kreisler's then unpublished solo cadenza for the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto. Shumsky had heard Kreisler perform the concerto twice in concert, and had reconstructed the cadenza from memory. Deeply impressed, Kreisler predicted that the young prodigy would become one of the finest violinists of the century.</p> <p>In the autumn of 1925, Shumsky enrolled at the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music in his home town, where he joined Auer's violin class.

He was also in great demand for studio work, and often led the RCA Victor Symphony and Columbia Symphony orchestras. Later, he was appointed as solo violinist for the NBC network in New York. During this golden age of American radio, he was featured weekly as soloist in radio broadcasts, often accompanied by Earl Wild at the piano.</p> <p>In 1959, he became co-director, with the pianist Glenn Gould, of the Stratford festival in Canada. They performed frequently in duo sonatas, and were often joined by the cellist Leonard Rose in trios. During these years, Shumsky began performing on the viola as well, and began to conduct. He also established himself as a superb teacher at the Curtis, Juilliard and Peabody conservatoires, as well as at Yale University. His students included Steven Staryk, Elliot Chapo, Ida Kavafian, Eugene Drucker and Philip Setzer, the last two members of the Emerson Quartet.</p> <p>Shumsky's primary instrument was the 1715 \"Rode, ex-Duke of Cambridge\" Stradivarius, but he also used a modern Italian violin by Enrico Rocca.

There are two things you need to know: first, lay it on thick, because people will always believe half of what you tell them. If you say to someone, \"You know, you're the most fascinating person I've ever met,\" they will naturally think, \"Well, that's nonsense - but I must be in the top 10.\" \"I have never heard a more brilliant speech\" translates in people's heads as \"That was pretty good, at least for you.\" </p> <p>The most successful flatterer I know of this type is Sir David Frost (\"super stuff, really super\") - and of course I've told him so many times. Gyles Brandreth is also absolutely marvellous. </p> <p>The other trick is to be very specific. Mr Stengel says that if you meet Tom Hanks, you shouldn't tell him you liked Forrest Gump, but that you adored one particular tracking shot in another film. So don't just say, \"Your Hamlet was quite, quite dazzling\"; add, \"You know, my friend Jed normally hates Shakespeare, but I persuaded him to come anyway, and the Yorick scene - I shouldn't tell you this, I suppose, but it made him cry.\" Don't tell a writer that you loved his or her book; say instead, \"That extended metaphor in chapter seven - I don't know how you did it!\" </p> <p>\u0095 Normally, the news that a married father of three had been caught by police in a gay sting operation would call for nothing but sympathy for him and his family. This feeling is tempered when the victim turns out to be Barry Hinkley, known as \"the corporate rottweiler\" at Stagecoach, the predatory transport company, which among its sins runs our dismal local train service. Mr Hinkley was in Houston, Texas, when he answered an ad covertly placed by the cops, and asked for a black male prostitute to be sent round to his hotel room. </p> <p>Mr Hinkley, whose business philosophy includes the line \"You can't afford to pay people for an hour's tea break or a meal break\", asked for full sex, whereupon his visitor revealed himself to be a police officer. (It is heartening to know that the crime rate in Houston is now so low that the police can spend time setting up elaborate traps for visiting gay businessmen.) </p> <p>He resigned after being suspended by Brian Souter, the multi-millionaire head of Stagecoach, who, by a wonderful, glorious irony, is the man who spent \u00a31m of his own money (it used to be our money, before he got his hands on all those massive taxpayer subsidies) on trying to prevent the Scottish parliament from repealing clause 28 - which, thank heavens, they did anyway. </p> <p>Mr Hinkley must be feeling dreadful now. But his feelings will be as nothing to the combined misery he has inflicted on travellers and on sacked employees. As a card-carrying, paid-up, tolerant, Guardian-reading, Guardian-writing, soggy liberal, I fear that the only reasonable reaction to his plight is a great big raspberry and a belly laugh. </p> <p>\u0095 Letters keep arriving from Wigan, the P\u00e9rigord of the north.

Though he had retired before the explosion in package travel really began, he helped change winter sports from a pursuit enjoyed almost exclusively by the upper middle classes to a passion which ran throughout the social spectrum.</p> <p>Ingham was born in Vienna, where his parents had moved after eloping. His father worked as south-east European manager for the Remington typewriter company, and it was at school in Austria that his love of skiing, climbing and sailing was born. His parents, who had hoped he would apply himself more rigorously to academic studies, were less than delighted. In 1932, Walter returned to England to work as a salesman, also for Remington. \"Very soon,\" he wrote later, \"I found that selling typewriters gave no job satisfaction and no skiing.\"</p> <p>He discovered that if he took a party of 15 people to the Alps, he could get a free rail ticket and hotel room into the bargain. In 1934, then living in a Kensington bedsitter, he left Remington with \u00a325 in capital and placed small ads in newspapers. That Christmas he took his first group to the Tyrol; by the end of the season, he had organised another five parties, and had \u00a380 in the bank.</p> <p>He started offering walking trips and holidays to the French mountains and seaside, as well as to Austria. The move served him well when Germany annexed Austria in 1938, for he was able to concentrate his business there. When his father retired, the two worked together as F&amp;W Ingham.</p> <p>Henry Lunn was already taking groups of public school and university educated skiers to Switzerland, but Walter's enduring and friendly rivalry was with Erna Low, who as Erna L\u00f6wwe, had thrown the javelin for Austria, come to England and, in 1932, similarly advertised for clients to take skiing.</p> <p>Walter was in France when war broke out, \"wishfully trying to organise our winter's operations\". He headed home by car. Later that year, he was back in France as a lance corporal, and married his wife Barbara in Le Mans. The wedding was on April 20. Thereafter, they never referred to their anniversary, calling it \"Hitler's birthday\" instead. Walter later served in north Africa, and after the Nazi defeat - he spoke fluent German with a Viennese accent - was sent to Austria to work with the control commission.</p> <p>When he emerged from the army with the rank of major in 1948, he set up in a Bond Street office with ex-War Department trestle tables covered with military blankets. During the following 14 years, Inghams grew steadily, eventually employing 80 full-time staff and 30 overseas representatives, and carrying some 14,000 people abroad each year.</p> <p>He operated snow trains to the Alps, sharing space with Erna Low, and introduced dancing cars in which customers would rock the night away as they rattled across the continent. By the early 1950s, Inghams was flying customers to the Alps in propellor-driven DC-3 aircraft.</p> <p>When he sold out to Hotelplan, part of the Swiss grocery wholesaling and retail organisation, Migros, in 1962, customers were still skiing in lace-up boots and using skis with finger-scraping cable bindings. He retired to Elba, to sail. A lover of classical music, he became a friend of the conductor Charles Mackerras, who also had a house on the island.</p> <p>The company Walter Ingham founded continues to operate, not as one of the giants of the travel business but, principally, as a leading winter sports specialist - and with one of the industry's longest surviving brand names.</p> <p>Ingham's wife died two years ago.

The blighters were all over the schedules like a rash: Bull Epic (\"a city lad's experiences\", Radio 4); Kings of the Ring (5 Live's history of boxing); How Tickled Am I? (Mark Radcliffe's Radio 4 tribute to north of England comedians - no girls there, I guess) and There'll Never Be Another (a Radio 4 tribute to_er_ Britain's top comic acts of the past. Overlap and overkill, yes. Dames, nope). </p> <p>As if all this wasn't enough, men were also in crisis this week under the tenacious scrutiny of Professor Anthony Clare and his team of merry helpers. These mainly consist of psychiatrists, regularly and cheerfully saying things like \"We are already impotent, already castrated\", \"It's men who suffer from penis envy\" and \"Ahhh, this is where we get back to the penis.\" We never actually leave it for long in Men in Crisis (Radio 4). </p> <p>Still, for all the cynical harridans - me for one - out there who might think men in crisis (yawn) is just sooo 1990s, or that chaps should sort themselves out like women have had to over the centuries, there were some startling stats, enough to make me put my Cosmopolitan down. Twice. Men are eight times more likely to commit GBH than women, 27 times more likely to murder. No surprises there, you might be thinking. But howzabout the fact that domestic violence makes up a quarter of all violent crime in the UK and that each week in this country, two women are murdered by their male partners? </p> <p>OK, so I only got into the programme because of what men in crisis might mean for women (and because I could listen to Anthony Clare talk about grouting and still be in heaven); but once in, I gave it unconditional love, which is more than Frank has ever had from anyone, including his girlfriend. \"I can only remember little bits,\" he says, edgily, \"like when I spat in her face.\" He never, he swears to Clare, caused \"any real damage\" - bruises but not hospitalisation. </p> <p>Listening to Frank and the other messed-up men in the programme's focus group was like watching a woodlouse on its back - all legs going wildly in the effort to turn over and just not being able to do it. The solution might not be a palatable one to the modern woman (men just need to \"be looked after and brought up with even greater sensitivity\"), but the problem isn't one we can just make Sex and the City-style jibes about. Even if it is fun and a cheap night out. </p> <p>Despite Jamie Theakston's best pleading, the sun refused to shine in Irvine on One Big Sunday (Radio 1). After a sultry, tropical week, the weather made its own small protest at the demise of the Radio 1 Roadshow this year. You remember: instead of DJs going out on the road to play in front of crowds, often at the seaside (too pass\u00e9), we have... well... DJs going out on the road to play in front of crowds at the seaside. These are called mini-festivals, though, just so there's no confusion. </p> <p>The roadshows used to feature cheesy bands miming. One Big Sunday had Ronan Keating and The Corrs. As soon as it ended, the sun came out, roastingly hot, pleased that it had made a stand against the shock of the new. </p> <p> Andy Williams (Radio 2), by way of contrast, was assured and reassuring. Playing Top of the Pops aged 70 with Music to Watch Girls By was, he assured us, \"better than Viagra.\" Hallelujah.</p>",

Even if it is fun and a cheap night out. Despite Jamie Theakston's best pleading, the sun refused to shine in Irvine on One Big Sunday (Radio 1). After a sultry, tropical week, the weather made its own small protest at the demise of the Radio 1 Roadshow this year. You remember: instead of DJs going out on the road to play in front of crowds, often at the seaside (too pass\u00e9), we have... well... DJs going out on the road to play in front of crowds at the seaside. These are called mini-festivals, though, just so there's no confusion. The roadshows used to feature cheesy bands miming. One Big Sunday had Ronan Keating and The Corrs. As soon as it ended, the sun came out, roastingly hot, pleased that it had made a stand against the shock of the new. Andy Williams (Radio 2), by way of contrast, was assured and reassuring. Playing Top of the Pops aged 70 with Music to Watch Girls By was, he assured us, \"better than Viagra.\" Hallelujah.",

      "body": "<p>Keith Jarrett stopped his comeback show on Wednesday barely before the cheers for his return, after years of absence from London, had died down. There was a hum from the piano's amplification, disturbing his equilibrium, and the full house at the Royal Festival Hall collectively held its breath as the legendarily raw-nerved virtuoso got up and ominously called to his sound engineer. It brought back distant memories of the solo concert at the same venue that Jarrett stopped in its tracks because he suspected somebody in the audience was recording him. Would he vanish as soon as he'd reappeared - like a genie retreating into the bottle - before he'd even begun to weave the old spell? </p> <p>The glitch was fixed and Jarrett sat down again in the church-like silence. Then he turned to the audience. \"For our second selection, we'd like to play_\" he began, and the breath was let out, the audience laughing and applauding, grateful for Jarrett's evident desire to break the ice. These are tense times for Jarrett.

      "bodyText": "Keith Jarrett stopped his comeback show on Wednesday barely before the cheers for his return, after years of absence from London, had died down. There was a hum from the piano's amplification, disturbing his equilibrium, and the full house at the Royal Festival Hall collectively held its breath as the legendarily raw-nerved virtuoso got up and ominously called to his sound engineer. It brought back distant memories of the solo concert at the same venue that Jarrett stopped in its tracks because he suspected somebody in the audience was recording him. Would he vanish as soon as he'd reappeared - like a genie retreating into the bottle - before he'd even begun to weave the old spell? The glitch was fixed and Jarrett sat down again in the church-like silence. Then he turned to the audience. \"For our second selection, we'd like to play_\" he began, and the breath was let out, the audience laughing and applauding, grateful for Jarrett's evident desire to break the ice. These are tense times for Jarrett. Off the scene for three years with chronic fatigue syndrome, the pianist has said that every show he does now is a gamble with his constitution. Would the old impassioned spontaneity be gone?

One of the earliest \"universal\" logos was the fish symbolising Christianity. This was used among early Christians facing Roman persecution. The Romans themselves made powerful use of logos -the legend SPQR (senatus populusque romanus) was emblazoned across civic buildings and the standards of military legions - as did the warlords of later ages.

When Frank Pick, then commercial manager of London Underground, commissioned the distinguished calligrapher Edward Johnston to design a logo, he created one of the most distinctive of all, the London Transport \"bullseye\" (or, in today's slightly modified form, \"roundel\").

      "body": "<p>Asmara, capital of Eritrea, lies 8,000 feet up in the highlands of east Africa. Its style is Italian, with palm tree'd avenues. It takes coffee seriously, inheriting different coffee traditions - Italian espresso and capuccino, and the wonderful ginger-spiced ceremonial coffee which is the climax of all formal meals. In Asmara, people try to dress well, and have their shoes cleaned outside the old Italian opera house. Around the Catholic cathedral, which evokes the long-gone years of the Italian colony of Eritrea, cafes and pastry-shops do good trade in the mornings and evenings. On the cathedral walls Benito Mussolini is mentioned among the donors, but the Eritrean people who have inherited the centre of the town are Coptic Christian and Muslim, and of East African demeanour. Apart from that, the absence of street crime and an exceptional lack of beggars, one might think the place was somewhere in southern Italy. </p> <p>But Asmara is a city under considerable threat. Eritrea has been invaded, and the Ethiopian lines are a morning's drive away. Though a peace treaty was signed in late June, the Ethiopians remain in place, and nearly everybody in the city fears that they might seek to break the cease-fire before the UN and Organisation of African Unity peacekeepers can be put in place 25 kilometres inside Eritrea. </p> <p>The Ethiopians do not primarily want Asmara. Their army might lunge towards the port of Asab, on the Red Sea, which Ethiopia seems to covet. Even so, given that the world is not too much concerned for the future of Eritrea, the citizens of Asmara know that, with a little bad luck, their city could lie in ruins, its sophistication gutted. So, trying to guess at Ethiopian intentions is a chief sport in Eritrea's coffee shops, particularly engaged in by the many people whom I met on previous visits to Eritrea, the rebels who fought the war of independence, which ended in 1991. </p> <p>One of those is Askalu Menkarios, now Minister for Labour. I first met her 13 years past, one morning during the long \"struggle\" when the truck I had been a passenger in during the night broke down. The Eritreans covered it with branches to protect it from detection by Ethiopian Mig fighters and I set off meek as a child in the care of my Eritrean escort to seek shelter. Seeing another camouflaged truck in front of a hole in a mountain, we entered a bunker and discovered a young Eritrean woman, a member of the rebel Congress, Askalu, suckling her child. </p> <p>A few weeks ago in Asmara, Askalu brought to see me the 14-year-old whom I had first met as an infant near She'b. That angular child is a characteristic middle-class kid from an urbane city, and Askalu must ask herself will her daughter need, and could she face, living in holes in the mountain like her mother before her? Askalu also reiterates the bemusement of many former Eritrean rebels. Since Ethiopia has, in the June peace talks, refused to state its claims, and will define them only when the peace process advances to the discussion of border demarcation, what did they really want from this renewed war? </p> <p>On my first two visits, I came to rebel-held Eritrea by truck from the Sudan, so it was not until my third visit that I saw Asmara. The Eritreans had not captured their capital until 1991, and I first came to it in 1993. It was an ecstatic city then, awaiting the UN-supervised referendum on independence. The men and women I had known as rebel soldiers in the mountains now wore suits. The world had turned benign. The Ethiopian dictator, Menghistu, had fled to Zimbabwe. The northern Ethiopian rebels, the Tigreans, allies of Eritrea, were in power in Ethiopia. To see the referendum, the new prime minister of Ethiopia, Meles Zenawi, was staying at the same hotel as my wife and I. In the villages of Serai Province, which has now been reinvaded by the Ethiopian army, people decorated our truck with wheels of bread, threw celebratory popcorn, chanted and danced before the polling booths. Not only would independence be achieved through a UN-supervised referendum, but the time of dying was over. </p> <p>There is no joy in those towns now. A few weeks ago around Deborwa, just 40 kilometres from the city, 100,000 people who escaped the invading Ethiopian army were living 15 to a tent, their little mattresses slotted tight under canvas. Many were living under trees in the open. More than one and a half million were displaced through the country - half the population. </p> <p>\"Tell the world!\" an adolescent Eritrean boy from the Ethiopian-held town of Senafe instructed me in English. For, although the Eritreans go to a great deal of trouble to ensure they do not fit the archetype of African refugee, it has begun raining on the camps in the hinterland, and mosquito hatchlings fill the evening air and visit malaria on a populace scraping by on short rations of lentils and flour. Since there has not been time to establish proper sanitation, gastric illness is everywhere. Children puke and are overcome close to family quarters by uncontrollable diarrhoea, compounding infection. </p> <p> In the past few weeks the Ethiopians have shortened their lines for logistical reasons, and some refugees have gone home. But it is to roofless and gutted towns and farmhouses, to plundered granaries and livestock pens, to fields littered with corpses and sown with mines. It is too late in the year now to plant a crop. This manufactured hunger will occupy the coming year. In eight months, said an aid expert, it will take 130 trucks to bring food up from the Red Sea port of Massawa to feed the Eritreans. </p> <p>The conflict between the two nations began as a border dispute nearly three years ago and moved on to become a full-scale invasion. Over their chief luxury, their coffee, the old rebels of the capital argue that what has befallen Eritrea is the equivalent of what befell Belgium in 1914 and Kuwait in 1991. And yet it is the invaded who are being punished, perhaps more acutely than the invaders. </p> <p>The UN Security Council has placed sanctions on both parties, but one sees unfeigned bemusement in the president Isaias Afwerki. I first met him, as I met Askalu, in the highlands 13 years ago. He told me that, as a student in Beijing at the time of Mao, he had concluded that the cult of personality was a destructive element in all politics. After independence, he remained reserved in his public appearances, and lived plainly. Yet his frankness, his forthrightness, may have contributed to some of Eritrea's problems. He was always a passionate advocate of African self-sufficiency. He cooperated with the late visionary Australian eye doctor, Fred Hollows, who wanted to put in place the technological means for Eritreans to manufacture their own intra- ocular lenses at an African price, for export to the poorer nations of the world at $7, instead of the western price of over $100. But it seems that the west does not like this stroppy attitude. </p> <p>Eritrea had achieved food self-sufficiency by the late 1990s, and aid organisations were kissed off - as they saw it, not always diplomatically. Now they are needed back, and help is not as forthcoming. With the war, and the destruction of cotton crops in western Eritrea, and even of a cotton pro duction plant at Tessenai, Isaias says: \"Dependence has suddenly become the condition of the whole population.\" Why, the people in Asmara's cafes ask, has there been so little international outcry over the invasion? Why has the US State Department been so late to react, and, with its ally, Canada, been so content to deal harshly with the Eritreans? Seventy-five per cent of what is coming in, to help the displaced clustering in the valleys and hillsides around Asmara, comes from Europe. </p> <p>The situation has not been helped by the two Badmes. There is a Badme in Tigre, Ethiopia, and one just over the border in Eritrea. The Ethiopian Badme is more heavily populated and appears on maps, so that many outsiders wrongly thought the Eritreans were attacking Tigrean Badme, when, in reality, they were defending Eritrean Badme. </p> <p>For a more forthright statement of how wrong the world community is, one needs to go to a person as vigorous as Lea Brilmayer, who holds a chair in international law at Yale and spends half the year in Eritrea working as adviser to Isaias. \"This war is a fraud,\" she says. It's a fraud, she argues, because there were no grounds for a border dispute - the border of Eritrea was fixed by a treaty in 1908 between Italy and the then Abyssinia, and appeared on Ethiopian maps until a few years ago. It's a fraud because the world believes that the Eritreans reacted aggressively, whereas she knows of the long and acutely polite protests president Isaias sent off to his friend Meles. It's a fraud because the world gave implicit permission for invasion, by ignoring the deportation of Eritreans from Ethiopia over the past two or more years. </p> <p> Where the Eritreans adopt an air of wistful bemusement, Brilmayer is full of pithiness. Eritrea is becoming Kosovo, she says, with the difference that \"people in Kosovo hold credit cards, so they're worth saving\". She says about the large ethnic Eritrean population now registered and under the gun in Ethiopia, that in five years: \"People could say this is Rwanda all over again. Why did we do nothing?\" </p> <p>And so Asmara waits as a weary world gathers together yet another peace-keeping exercise. It is clear that, unless there is vigorous international influence, a pretext may be found by the Ethiopian regime to renew the war and to lunge at Asab before the peacekeepers arrive. On past evidence, I would not be surprised if Eritrea, although it has no self-interest in any further aggression, were blamed. Should that happen, of course, a remarkable society will be destroyed and a number of us will write wise books on how the disaster was achieved - in the normal way, through an impotence of reaction. </p> <p>\u0095 Thomas Keneally is the author of Schindler's Ark and Towards Asmara: A Story Of Africa.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Asmara, capital of Eritrea, lies 8,000 feet up in the highlands of east Africa. Its style is Italian, with palm tree'd avenues. It takes coffee seriously, inheriting different coffee traditions - Italian espresso and capuccino, and the wonderful ginger-spiced ceremonial coffee which is the climax of all formal meals. In Asmara, people try to dress well, and have their shoes cleaned outside the old Italian opera house. Around the Catholic cathedral, which evokes the long-gone years of the Italian colony of Eritrea, cafes and pastry-shops do good trade in the mornings and evenings. On the cathedral walls Benito Mussolini is mentioned among the donors, but the Eritrean people who have inherited the centre of the town are Coptic Christian and Muslim, and of East African demeanour. Apart from that, the absence of street crime and an exceptional lack of beggars, one might think the place was somewhere in southern Italy. But Asmara is a city under considerable threat. Eritrea has been invaded, and the Ethiopian lines are a morning's drive away. Though a peace treaty was signed in late June, the Ethiopians remain in place, and nearly everybody in the city fears that they might seek to break the cease-fire before the UN and Organisation of African Unity peacekeepers can be put in place 25 kilometres inside Eritrea. The Ethiopians do not primarily want Asmara. Their army might lunge towards the port of Asab, on the Red Sea, which Ethiopia seems to covet. Even so, given that the world is not too much concerned for the future of Eritrea, the citizens of Asmara know that, with a little bad luck, their city could lie in ruins, its sophistication gutted. So, trying to guess at Ethiopian intentions is a chief sport in Eritrea's coffee shops, particularly engaged in by the many people whom I met on previous visits to Eritrea, the rebels who fought the war of independence, which ended in 1991. One of those is Askalu Menkarios, now Minister for Labour. I first met her 13 years past, one morning during the long \"struggle\" when the truck I had been a passenger in during the night broke down. The Eritreans covered it with branches to protect it from detection by Ethiopian Mig fighters and I set off meek as a child in the care of my Eritrean escort to seek shelter. Seeing another camouflaged truck in front of a hole in a mountain, we entered a bunker and discovered a young Eritrean woman, a member of the rebel Congress, Askalu, suckling her child. A few weeks ago in Asmara, Askalu brought to see me the 14-year-old whom I had first met as an infant near She'b. That angular child is a characteristic middle-class kid from an urbane city, and Askalu must ask herself will her daughter need, and could she face, living in holes in the mountain like her mother before her? Askalu also reiterates the bemusement of many former Eritrean rebels. Since Ethiopia has, in the June peace talks, refused to state its claims, and will define them only when the peace process advances to the discussion of border demarcation, what did they really want from this renewed war? On my first two visits, I came to rebel-held Eritrea by truck from the Sudan, so it was not until my third visit that I saw Asmara. The Eritreans had not captured their capital until 1991, and I first came to it in 1993. It was an ecstatic city then, awaiting the UN-supervised referendum on independence. The men and women I had known as rebel soldiers in the mountains now wore suits. The world had turned benign. The Ethiopian dictator, Menghistu, had fled to Zimbabwe. The northern Ethiopian rebels, the Tigreans, allies of Eritrea, were in power in Ethiopia. To see the referendum, the new prime minister of Ethiopia, Meles Zenawi, was staying at the same hotel as my wife and I. In the villages of Serai Province, which has now been reinvaded by the Ethiopian army, people decorated our truck with wheels of bread, threw celebratory popcorn, chanted and danced before the polling booths. Not only would independence be achieved through a UN-supervised referendum, but the time of dying was over. There is no joy in those towns now. A few weeks ago around Deborwa, just 40 kilometres from the city, 100,000 people who escaped the invading Ethiopian army were living 15 to a tent, their little mattresses slotted tight under canvas. Many were living under trees in the open. More than one and a half million were displaced through the country - half the population. \"Tell the world!\" an adolescent Eritrean boy from the Ethiopian-held town of Senafe instructed me in English.

      "body": "<p><strong> The subject</strong> <br> Pieces of fish that have been given a long soak in a high-acid solution. Sounds like a chemistry experiment, but it's merely a mega-trendy menu item of the moment. And one of the world's great ultra-simple dishes. Pronounced seh-VEE-chay in Mexican Spanish, whence it comes; spelled seviche in some sources. Probably acquired by Mexico through trading with Polynesian islanders.</p> <p><strong> The basics </strong><br> Applying acid to animal protein denatures it, making the fibres contract and express water. When the animals in question are fish, and when they're cut up into small pieces, and when the acid bath lasts long enough, the effect is similar to that of cooking: the flesh becomes opaque and very firm. That's why recipes for ceviche often describe the process as 'cooking' the fish in the liquid. It ain't so, but what the hell.</p> <p><strong> The details</strong> <br> First, select your fish. Mexicans traditionally use sierra - aka, kingfish - which is similar to mackerel. You can use mackerel, too. Or any good white fish. Or scallops, if you want to push the boat out. Salmon doesn't look so good after the acid's had a go. But, whatever you use, it must be splendidly fresh. Next, choose your acid. Lime juice is traditional, and the best option.

      "bodyText": "The subject Pieces of fish that have been given a long soak in a high-acid solution. Sounds like a chemistry experiment, but it's merely a mega-trendy menu item of the moment. And one of the world's great ultra-simple dishes. Pronounced seh-VEE-chay in Mexican Spanish, whence it comes; spelled seviche in some sources. Probably acquired by Mexico through trading with Polynesian islanders. The basics Applying acid to animal protein denatures it, making the fibres contract and express water. When the animals in question are fish, and when they're cut up into small pieces, and when the acid bath lasts long enough, the effect is similar to that of cooking: the flesh becomes opaque and very firm. That's why recipes for ceviche often describe the process as 'cooking' the fish in the liquid. It ain't so, but what the hell. The details First, select your fish. Mexicans traditionally use sierra - aka, kingfish - which is similar to mackerel. You can use mackerel, too. Or any good white fish. Or scallops, if you want to push the boat out. Salmon doesn't look so good after the acid's had a go. But, whatever you use, it must be splendidly fresh. Next, choose your acid. Lime juice is traditional, and the best option. But since limes are a lot dearer in Colchester than in Cuernavaca, they can be eked out with lemon (or even a tip-top wine vinegar). Finally, choose your flavourings: fresh chilli, garlic, onion, tomato, spices such as cumin and coriander - you've got the idea. Marinate the fish in the acid only for around 10 hours, then test for 'doneness' by cutting into a piece - it should be opaque right through the centre. If it is, you can now add the flavourings, mix and leave for another hour or so. Where to buy The best fish is not found in supermarkets. The easy way out Pickled herring?",

We can now turn to the real business of the day: opening bottles. Let us go first to Somerfield, which has some marvellous new reds. Pietroasa Young Vatted Cabernet Sauvignon 1998 (16 points, out of 20, \u00a33.99), from Romania, is what beaujolais would love to be. It has similar cheeky freshness, but more character, bite and tannins, and a rich finish. Somerfield Chilean Merlot 1999 (17 points, \u00a34.49) explodes in the mouth like a spicy cherry/blackcurrant grenade. Hugely impressive depth and leatheriness here. Hardy s Nottage Hill Cabernet Sauvignon/Shiraz 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a35.79) is one of Aussie's sassiest red-wine bargains under six quid in this vintage. It has thrilling tannins and subtle spiciness. Somerfield Cabernet Sauvignon/Merlot Vina La Rosa 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a33.99) is a marvel of a blend, offering spice, blackcurrants, leather, plums, all rolled up into a powerful knot of intense flavour. Last at Somerfield, there is that Argentine Sangiovese 1999. The texture is lush and ripe, the 17-point fruit is complex and savoury, the finish is enough to turn a Chianti farmer green, especially at \u00a34.29 the bottle. It is one of most quaffable reds I've encountered all year. </p> <p>So is Santa Julia Tempranillo Oak Reserve 1998. Incredibly well and warmly textured, and gently spicy, it offers outstanding tannins and complex fruit, rating 17 points and costing \u00a35.99. This wine, like those that follow, can be found at Unwins, the homely, almost quaintly southern chain that recently gobbled up Fullers. Vinas del Vero Cabernet Sauvignon 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a35.49), from Spain, flaunts decent tannins, too, and the fruit, in perfect harmony, progresses in stately yet vividelegance over the tastebuds. Vina Porta Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon 1998 (16 points, \u00a34.99), from Chile, also has some urgent tannic richness and solid, meaty fruit, as does Penta Cabernet Sauvignon/Malbec 1999 (16 points, \u00a33.99), also from Chile. There is compelling richness and controlled tannicity with the Penta wine, along with beautiful texture and ripeness. </p> <p>The tannins in Chapelle St Marie Syrah 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a34.99) are more savoury, and they are allied to marvellously earthy fruit. With Domaine de l'Arneillaud Cairanne Ctes du Rhne Villages 1999, we move into herbier pastures. There is sensational potency of texture here and compelling depth. It has intense, world-class tannins, and costs only \u00a35.99. Will you uncork the same wine as I did, and rate it 18 points, as I do, if you buy a bottle? With natural cork, there s always a chance you will be disappointed. I do not want disappointed readers.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Old fax machine seized up. Whenever a fax arrives, it should be chopped off by a pair of blades. But the blades are buckled and now instead of chopping, they engage each other in a rusty embrace and will not be separated. Not sure how to deter machinery behaving badly. Vaguely associate coupling dogs and buckets of water. But not sure if it's the answer for (presumably) hermaphroditic fax machine. \"Dulcie? Therre's something stuck up my chimney, dearr! \" Aged aunt whispers in tone of voice reserved for indelicate ailments. \"It keeps squawking and flapping!\" Aunt has been eccentric recently. Perhaps she has secretly laid clutch of phoenix eggs in her fireplace. It would certainly have been so in Greek myth. Life in small town near Swindon falls lamentably short of such excitement. Go to aunt's room to investigate. As we arrive, startled black bird falls into hearth in tumble of disordered feathers. \"It's a black bird!\" I cry foolishly. \"No, dearr - it's a young jackdaw!\" insists Aunt. Always pulling rank when it comes to ornithology. I'm a member of the RSPB, too, and I once bought The Book Of Indian Birds in Hay-on-Wye. One day I shall go to the Himalayan foothills and spot the Haircrested Drongo. That'll put her nose out of joint. Jackdaw flies madly around the room. Duck, but do not panic. I'm at my best with frantic animals. After 20 years of family life, who isn't? Give me a strange rash in the armpit and I'll rush off and weep tragically in the garden shed. Give me a recipe for lasagne and I'll produce a scale model of Wicken Fen. But give me a maddened jackdaw and, for a moment, I'm adequate. Open window with ostentatious sang-froid. It said \"Believe in yourself!\" on my internet horoscope. \"Stop all this self-criticism! Release your talents! Take control!\" This encouragement comes from Nuga, by the way. Most internet astrologers are Canadian. I'm half-tempted to have an online psychic chat with Nuga. I'm beginning to wonder if Saturn has gone retrograde again. I certainly have.

      "body": "<p>The part-man, part-woman who still calls himself Harold is trying to gather the courage to finally fight back against South Africa's military. It was the army, after all, which abandoned him more than a decade ago, part way through \"treatment\" to turn him from a male to a female under a discredited policy of trying to \"cure\" homosexual conscripts. </p> <p>\"I now know that in one sense I was just unlucky. The army had whole gay battalions who they just shunted aside and let be. But if things went wrong and you ended up in the hands of the psychologists then it could get very bad. In my case it began with the electric shocks and only ended after they'd already given me breasts, and then the army said it had abandoned the whole policy,\" he said. </p> <p>He is not alone. Thousands of other gays were subjected to electric shock therapy, hormone treatment and chemical castration through the 1970s and 80s, when national service was compulsory for white males and homosexuality was a crime. </p> <p>Some lesbians were also given \"cures\". </p> <p>An as-yet unpublished report, called the Aversion Project, commissioned by gay rights groups and South Africa's medical research council, details the extent of the abuses and is expected to form the basis of demands for corrective treatment, and demands that the doctors behind the \"treatments\" be held accountable by the medical authorities. </p> <p>The attempts to \"cure\" homosexuals began after the creation of the infamous ward 22 at the Voortrekkerhoogte military hospital near Pretoria in 1969. The ward, which ostensibly catered for servicemen with psychological problems, was under the command of an army colonel and psychologist, Aubrey Levin. </p> <p><strong> Aversion therapy</strong><br> </p> <p>Dr Levin treated genuinely disturbed patients, but was also keen to take in other soldiers to \"cure\". His focus was homosexuals and drug users. Commanding officers and chaplains were encouraged to refer \"deviants\" for \"treatment\". </p> <p>At first Dr Levin was convinced he could make heterosexuals out of gay patients, using electroconvulsive aversion therapy. Michael Smith, now a 46-year-old marketing manager in Johannesburg, was sent to ward 22 after Dr Levin forced him to admit he was homosexual in front of his parents. He was then an 18-year-old conscript. </p> <p>\"It was the first time they realised I was homosexual and they were horrified. Dr Levin told them he had a therapy that would 'reorientate' me, so I agreed to the treatment,\" he said. </p> <p>The treatment consisted of strapping electrodes to the upper arm with wires running to a dial calibrated from one to 10. Homosexual soldiers were shown pictures of a naked man and encouraged to fantasise, then the power was ratcheted up until the patient could take no more. </p> <p>The subject was then shown an image of a naked woman. </p> <p>\"When you kind of reached the maximum point and then you'd say 'No, no, no, I couldn't stand it any more', then he would say: 'Now you must think about your girlfriend', and all that sort of off-the-wall statements,\" said Mr Smith. </p> <p>\"I was actually just completely freaked out and confused. It certainly didn't do much for my impulses of attraction for other boys.\" </p> <p>Trudie Grobler, an intern psychologist on ward 22, saw a lesbian subjected to such severe shocks that her shoes flew off. </p> <p>\"It was traumatic. I could not believe her body could handle it,\" she said. </p> <p>Dr Levin believed the same treatment could also cure \"drug addicts\", mostly men caught smoking marijuana. There were also those who simply did not want to serve in the apartheid military. They were tagged as \"disturbed\". </p> <p>On arrival at ward 22, \"patients\" were stripped of their clothes and shoes and given brown pyjamas. The army said that would help to prevent escapes. Every new patient was put on Valium. The ward orderlies carried pistols. </p> <p>Dr Levin also subjected his patients to narco-analysis or a \"truth drug\", involving the slow injection of a barbiturate before the questioning began. Dr Levin does not deny its use. </p> <p><strong> Hard labour</strong><br> </p> <p>\"Narco-analysis was used, I give you that, but it was used in very isolated cases and only to help treat post-traumatic stress. Narco-analysis was used to help get victims to talk about the trauma they suffered,\" he said. </p> <p>But former patients say that gays and \"drug addicts\" were subjected to the treatment to see if they were really \"cured\". Drug users considered habitual addicts were sent to a hard-labour farm. </p> <p>Dr Levin, who became chief psychiatrist for the whole South African military, eventually concluded that aversion therapy was a failure and abandoned it in favour of other methods. </p> <p>One gay soldier, Jean Erasmus, was chemically castrated by Dr Levin at Bloemfontein psychiatric hospital in 1980. </p> <p>Before he committed suicide last year, Erasmus recorded a tape detailing the broader abuse of homosexuals in the army, including how he was forced by his officers to participate in the gang rape of Angolan women, and how other gay soldiers were given hormone drugs. </p> <p>\"I am quite convinced that quite a few murders of gay people took place which we will never know of, and it was covered up. When people got trigger happy, gays were often the brunt of the bullet.\" </p> <p>In practice, the army's treatment of gays was confused. Many found themselves in de facto \"gay battalions\", according to Mikki van Zyl, a researcher on the Aversion Project report. </p> <p>\"In Uppington, virtually the whole battalion was queer until some general decided this should be broken up. There was one in Grahamstown. There was another in Pretoria. For some of them, these were supportive environments,\" she said. </p> <p>Some men joined the army specifically to get a sex change operation. But others were pressured into surgery by military psychologists after other methods failed. The army carried out as many as 50 sex change operations a year. </p> <p>Lesbians were also offered surgery - one woman is among those left partially altered after the programme was shut down. </p> <p>The Aversion Project report argues that the doctors concerned broke international law. </p> <p>\"Health workers in the [military] were expected to be loyal first to the state and its ideologies. It meant that some doctors flagrantly ignored terms from the Geneva convention and Tokyo declaration, and certainly showed no accountability to the national professional councils, nor best current practices. The stage was set for human rights abuses of patients under the care of such doctors.\" </p> <p>Ms van Zyl says that while the army as an institution should be held accountable, Dr Levin has particular responsibility. </p> <p>\"He left a trail of experiments. He worked in environments where he had captive subjects and he abused them,\" she said. </p> <p>Dr Levin emigrated to Canada at about the time he was warned by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa that he would be named as an abuser of human rights. </p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian from Canada, where he works at a teaching hospital, he said he left South Africa only because of the high crime rate, and denied the accusations against him. </p> <p>\"Nobody was given electric shock treatment by me. What we practised was aversion therapy. We caused slight, very slight, pain in the arm by contracting the muscles, using an electronic device,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Nobody was held against his or her will. We did not keep human guinea pigs, like Russian communists; we only had patients who wanted to be cured and were there voluntarily.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The part-man, part-woman who still calls himself Harold is trying to gather the courage to finally fight back against South Africa's military. It was the army, after all, which abandoned him more than a decade ago, part way through \"treatment\" to turn him from a male to a female under a discredited policy of trying to \"cure\" homosexual conscripts. \"I now know that in one sense I was just unlucky. The army had whole gay battalions who they just shunted aside and let be. But if things went wrong and you ended up in the hands of the psychologists then it could get very bad. In my case it began with the electric shocks and only ended after they'd already given me breasts, and then the army said it had abandoned the whole policy,\" he said. He is not alone. Thousands of other gays were subjected to electric shock therapy, hormone treatment and chemical castration through the 1970s and 80s, when national service was compulsory for white males and homosexuality was a crime. Some lesbians were also given \"cures\". An as-yet unpublished report, called the Aversion Project, commissioned by gay rights groups and South Africa's medical research council, details the extent of the abuses and is expected to form the basis of demands for corrective treatment, and demands that the doctors behind the \"treatments\" be held accountable by the medical authorities. The attempts to \"cure\" homosexuals began after the creation of the infamous ward 22 at the Voortrekkerhoogte military hospital near Pretoria in 1969. The ward, which ostensibly catered for servicemen with psychological problems, was under the command of an army colonel and psychologist, Aubrey Levin. Aversion therapy Dr Levin treated genuinely disturbed patients, but was also keen to take in other soldiers to \"cure\". His focus was homosexuals and drug users. Commanding officers and chaplains were encouraged to refer \"deviants\" for \"treatment\". At first Dr Levin was convinced he could make heterosexuals out of gay patients, using electroconvulsive aversion therapy. Michael Smith, now a 46-year-old marketing manager in Johannesburg, was sent to ward 22 after Dr Levin forced him to admit he was homosexual in front of his parents. He was then an 18-year-old conscript. \"It was the first time they realised I was homosexual and they were horrified. Dr Levin told them he had a therapy that would 'reorientate' me, so I agreed to the treatment,\" he said. The treatment consisted of strapping electrodes to the upper arm with wires running to a dial calibrated from one to 10. Homosexual soldiers were shown pictures of a naked man and encouraged to fantasise, then the power was ratcheted up until the patient could take no more. The subject was then shown an image of a naked woman. \"When you kind of reached the maximum point and then you'd say 'No, no, no, I couldn't stand it any more', then he would say: 'Now you must think about your girlfriend', and all that sort of off-the-wall statements,\" said Mr Smith. \"I was actually just completely freaked out and confused. It certainly didn't do much for my impulses of attraction for other boys.\" Trudie Grobler, an intern psychologist on ward 22, saw a lesbian subjected to such severe shocks that her shoes flew off. \"It was traumatic. I could not believe her body could handle it,\" she said. Dr Levin believed the same treatment could also cure \"drug addicts\", mostly men caught smoking marijuana. There were also those who simply did not want to serve in the apartheid military. They were tagged as \"disturbed\". On arrival at ward 22, \"patients\" were stripped of their clothes and shoes and given brown pyjamas. The army said that would help to prevent escapes. Every new patient was put on Valium. The ward orderlies carried pistols. Dr Levin also subjected his patients to narco-analysis or a \"truth drug\", involving the slow injection of a barbiturate before the questioning began. Dr Levin does not deny its use. Hard labour \"Narco-analysis was used, I give you that, but it was used in very isolated cases and only to help treat post-traumatic stress. Narco-analysis was used to help get victims to talk about the trauma they suffered,\" he said. But former patients say that gays and \"drug addicts\" were subjected to the treatment to see if they were really \"cured\". Drug users considered habitual addicts were sent to a hard-labour farm. Dr Levin, who became chief psychiatrist for the whole South African military, eventually concluded that aversion therapy was a failure and abandoned it in favour of other methods. One gay soldier, Jean Erasmus, was chemically castrated by Dr Levin at Bloemfontein psychiatric hospital in 1980. Before he committed suicide last year, Erasmus recorded a tape detailing the broader abuse of homosexuals in the army, including how he was forced by his officers to participate in the gang rape of Angolan women, and how other gay soldiers were given hormone drugs. \"I am quite convinced that quite a few murders of gay people took place which we will never know of, and it was covered up. When people got trigger happy, gays were often the brunt of the bullet.\" In practice, the army's treatment of gays was confused. Many found themselves in de facto \"gay battalions\", according to Mikki van Zyl, a researcher on the Aversion Project report. \"In Uppington, virtually the whole battalion was queer until some general decided this should be broken up. There was one in Grahamstown. There was another in Pretoria. For some of them, these were supportive environments,\" she said. Some men joined the army specifically to get a sex change operation. But others were pressured into surgery by military psychologists after other methods failed. The army carried out as many as 50 sex change operations a year. Lesbians were also offered surgery - one woman is among those left partially altered after the programme was shut down. The Aversion Project report argues that the doctors concerned broke international law. \"Health workers in the [military] were expected to be loyal first to the state and its ideologies. It meant that some doctors flagrantly ignored terms from the Geneva convention and Tokyo declaration, and certainly showed no accountability to the national professional councils, nor best current practices. The stage was set for human rights abuses of patients under the care of such doctors.\" Ms van Zyl says that while the army as an institution should be held accountable, Dr Levin has particular responsibility. \"He left a trail of experiments. He worked in environments where he had captive subjects and he abused them,\" she said. Dr Levin emigrated to Canada at about the time he was warned by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa that he would be named as an abuser of human rights. Speaking to the Guardian from Canada, where he works at a teaching hospital, he said he left South Africa only because of the high crime rate, and denied the accusations against him. \"Nobody was given electric shock treatment by me. What we practised was aversion therapy. We caused slight, very slight, pain in the arm by contracting the muscles, using an electronic device,\" he said. \"Nobody was held against his or her will. We did not keep human guinea pigs, like Russian communists; we only had patients who wanted to be cured and were there voluntarily.\"",
