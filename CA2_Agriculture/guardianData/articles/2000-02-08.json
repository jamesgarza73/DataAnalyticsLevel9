We will consider the matter in the light of that information.\" </p> <p>Reed's actions were yesterday defended by the former Premier League referee Roger Milford, who said he himself had acted in a similar manner on many occasions. </p> <p>\"I would have done what Mike did; in fact I did it many times,\" he said. \"Mike is involved in the game and he is happy that he has done something right. It wasn't done with any malicious intent, it was done through pure love of the game.\" </p> <p>The chairman of the Leeds United Supporters' Association, Ray Fell, also exonerated Reed. \"Some might say that it was silly of the referee to do what he did, but it was a good goal and I don't think anything the referee did have much effect on it,\" he said. \"Liverpool had a good day and we were well beaten.\" </p> <p>Ten days ago one of Reed's colleagues, Rob Harris, was suspended for a month for his part in the incident during the FA Cup fourth-round tie between Tranmere Rovers and Sunderland when the First Division club briefly had 11 men on the pitch despite having had a player sent off.</p>",

I was simply pleased with myself for having made what turned out to be the right decision.\" Although Reed admitted it was an unorthodox form of celebration which he would not seek to repeat, he said he was \"comfortable\" with his actions. \"Everyone is delighted when a referee does play the advantage and it pays off,\" he added. \"The referee does love to see the ball in the back of the net after he has waved play on because it proves he was right.\" However, the Premier League spokesman Mike Lee said that such displays of emotion from match officials should not be encouraged. \"We understand the emotions involved but such gestures are open to misinterpretation and cannot be encouraged. \"We have asked Mike Reed to provide us with a written report of the incident and we are seeking to view the video evidence. We will consider the matter in the light of that information.\" Reed's actions were yesterday defended by the former Premier League referee Roger Milford, who said he himself had acted in a similar manner on many occasions. \"I would have done what Mike did; in fact I did it many times,\" he said. \"Mike is involved in the game and he is happy that he has done something right. It wasn't done with any malicious intent, it was done through pure love of the game.\" The chairman of the Leeds United Supporters' Association, Ray Fell, also exonerated Reed. \"Some might say that it was silly of the referee to do what he did, but it was a good goal and I don't think anything the referee did have much effect on it,\" he said. \"Liverpool had a good day and we were well beaten.\" Ten days ago one of Reed's colleagues, Rob Harris, was suspended for a month for his part in the incident during the FA Cup fourth-round tie between Tranmere Rovers and Sunderland when the First Division club briefly had 11 men on the pitch despite having had a player sent off.",

The groups argued in court that while the medical reports remained secret they were unable to mount a meaningful challenge to Straw's decision. \"This is a victory for fundamental fairness, and for the rights of Pinochet's victims not to have their quest for justice terminated on the basis of secret evidence examined behind closed doors,\" said Reed Brody of New York-based human rights watch, which is involved in the court action. \"The plane can go back to the Bahamas,\" he added, referring to the Chilean jet that had flown to Britain to pick up Pinochet. The judicial review means that whatever the outcome there could now be appeals up to the House of Lords, Britain's highest court. But there is still the possibility that matters could be cut short. If the reports are released it is possible that, having seen them, the human rights groups and the Belgians might agree that Pinochet is not fit to stand trial and may drop any extradition moves. Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon, who secured Pinochet's arrest in London in October 1998, is seeking the general's extradition on torture charges dating from the latter part of his 1973-1990 rule of Chile. More than 3,000 people died or disappeared after Pinochet ousted socialist president Salvador Allende in a violent coup.",

      "body": "<b>The Bishop of Blackburn</b> <br> Since 1988 the national curriculum for schools has been introduced and education Acts passed which have placed what we are concerned about firmly in the hands of the governing bodies of the schools. In a situation in which parental choice largely decides which schools flourish--at least numerically in pupil numbers--it seems hard to conceive of school governors pursuing a policy which promotes homosexuality. However, I hope that they will take every step to prevent bullying based on sexual orientation. In other words, whatever happens to section 28, the desire of the vast majority - the so-called \"silent majority\" - of parents and, indeed, of society at large for SRE to be based on heterosexual marriage as the norm will not be met. The confusion will remain. <p>However, I am well aware and, indeed, fully share the concern of those in this House and outside who say that, irrespective of the legal position under which our schools now operate, the government's desire and intention to repeal section 28 will send out signs and signals. As a Christian leader I believe that signs and signals are most important. The signs and signals in this case are that homosexual relationships have parity with heterosexual relationships and marriage, as understood and practised for generations as the Christian tradition has understood that. </p> <p><b>Lord Whitty (junior minister at the department of the environment)</b><br> As the right reverend Prelate said, my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education, is currently engaged in very detailed discussions with the Churches and other faiths on this issue. However, I realise that that guidance may not be quite sufficient to reassure people. Therefore I would hope that the right reverend Prelate and others who support his amendment would recognise that some further discussions are needed on this. My right honourable friend the secretary of state for education stands ready to talk to the right reverend Prelate and other colleagues to take this further and to see what should be the balance between primary legislation and guidance in order to reassure people. </p> <p>The central problem is that most of the concerns expressed relate to schools, whereas section 28 does not really apply to schools. We are here debating this in a local government bill context, whereas most of the issues relate to education. The issue of the repeal of section 28 ought, logically, to be separate from the safeguards that are in place to ensure that children receive appropriate sex and relationships education in schools. Unfortunately they have become enmeshed in the whole of this debate. </p> <p><b>Lord Quirk</b><br> Of course, in a free society we should all be free to take risks with any activity that is legal, from smoking to bunjee jumping. Smoking is a good example, because with smoking no one is left in any doubt as to what is dangerous and why, and as to what are the risks. </p> <p>So it is a puzzle to me, and I think to many outside this House, that issues of sexual health and sexual education are seriously neglected. One only has to contemplate our remarkable figures, a European record in this particular sport at least, on teenage, and indeed pre-teenage, pregnancies to feel that there is something grievously amiss with our health education and perhaps to wonder why our sex education has become so solidly fixated upon AIDS. AIDS is a terrible threat in all conscience, but one which needs to be put in the context of a broader, more balanced and more fundamental tackling of sex education.</p> <p><b>Lord St John of Fawsley</b><br> It has been the consistent position of the universal Christian Church that all sexual acts outside marriage are wrong. There is no difference in that regard between heterosexual and homosexual acts. I subscribe to that tradition and it certainly rules out such fantasies as homosexual marriages in church. </p> <p>It may seem harsh but that is the teaching of the Church. It is difficult because not everybody can, or desires to, live a celibate life. But those problems are best dealt with in the secrecy of the confessional or in private counselling and not in the glare of the public forum. I hope that whatever the result of this debate, it will not hinder those who are working in that field in bringing comfort to those who are in difficulty. </p> <p><b>Lord Longford</b><br> My reaction to homosexuals is simple enough, and I speak as one who has promoted \"homosexualism\", if you like, among the gay lobby. Forty years ago, when I promoted the Wolfenden report - no one else would touch it - the late Lord Boothby referred to me as the unpaid leader of the homosexual lobby. That report was in favour of homosexuals not being prosecuted if they were over the age of 21. </p> <p>Nevertheless, as the noble Lord has just said, homosexuality is against Christian rules, as is any sex outside marriage. Homosexuality can have terrible, tragic results. Whatever else it does, it deprives people of the supreme joy of marriage and children. Helping a young person to become a homosexual means that he will never be married and never have children. That is a terrible burden to inflict on a child, although it is no worse than the behaviour of a heterosexual man who has five mistresses. I do not say that one is worse than the other. They are both against the rules. They are both sinful.</p> <p><b>Baroness Young</b><br> I have said publicly on many occasions that, like the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Blackburn, I believe that marriage is best; that marriage is the right way to live. </p> <p>The right reverend Prelate did not say this, but I believe also that there is no moral equivalence between homosexual and heterosexual relationships. As a teacher and a parent I feel that we need to set in front of children an ideal by which they should live. They may not live up to it; I do not live up to ideals either. But I have an idea of how I ought to live. That is what we should strive for. That is what we should put in front of children. To say to children that there are alternatives in life which are equally valid is not right. One needs to be careful what one says to vulnerable children growing up uncertain of the way. What one says to adults and what adults do is a completely different matter and the two points should not be confused. </p> <p><b>Baroness Gould</b><br> It is unfortunate that what should have been a mature debate about a civilised society, recognising diversity and determining ways of eradicating discrimination, has, in some quarters, been conducted in a tone of hysteria that itself promotes homophobic views and encourages prejudices and harassment. The debate so far has generated more heat than light, at a time when light was what was required. What also appears to be clear from some of the press reports over the weekend is the fact that there are some people who do not want to see that light - who want to keep a restraint on local government, who ignore the need for equality and democracy, who have no desire to achieve equality of treatment for all young people and who do not want clarity for teachers and parents over what can and cannot be discussed. It is that clarity that we must have: the confusion has to be removed. I believe that the amendment brings us nearer to establishing the principles upon which that clarity can be achieved. </p> <p> <b>Full text of speeches</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/p  dvn/lds00/text/00207-04.htm#00207-04_spnew7\">The Bishop of Blackburn</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/p  dvn/lds00/text/00207-05.htm#00207-05_spnew0\">Lord Whitty</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/p  dvn/lds00/text/00207-05.htm#00207-05_spnew1\">Lord Quirk</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/p  dvn/lds00/text/00207-05.htm\">Lord St John of Fawsley</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/p  dvn/lds00/text/00207-06.htm\">Lord Longford</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/p  dvn/lds00/text/00207-06.htm\">Baroness Young</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/p  dvn/lds00/text/00207-07.htm\">Baroness Gould</a></p>",

It will also say that schools should not promote any kind of sexual activity or orientation among children, and must act against bullying based on sexuality.

The alternative would be to make the repeal of section 28 a separate bill, which could be forced through parliament despite the objections of peers. But such a move could take more than a year, forcing the issue into the sensitive pre-election period. Peers voted by 210 to 165 last night to back Baroness Young's amendment after an impassioned debate in which she argued that there 'is not a moral equivalence between heterosexual and homosexual relationships' and that children should be set ideals by which they should live. Lord Alli, the openly-gay Labour peer, said the debate was about 'the morality of hate'. He added: 'I believe that hate exists because we teach our children to hate.' Education secretary David Blunkett and ministers in the Lords are now talking to religious leaders and moderate opponents of reform in the Lords to try to find a compromise formula. The government claims that section 28 - introduced under Margaret Thatcher's administration - prevents teachers from acting against the bullying of gay pupils. However, the move to repeal it has sparked vociferous opposition from church leaders and family groups, who argue it would undermine the family and lead to children receiving inappropriate information. Local government minister Hilary Armstrong said today the government was \"very disappointed\" at the vote, but would press on with its plans. The Lords' defeat of the government's plan to repeal a law banning local authorities from promoting homosexuality will not affect a similar repeal move in Scotland.",

      "body": "<p>Few people have to live through a hijack drama. The closest most of us come is the television broadcasts and newspaper headlines. But just that word - hijack - is guaranteed to send a chill down the spine, whenever it happens, wherever it happens.</p> <p>The consequences for those whose lives are caught up more intimately in these modern-day tales of terror can be grave - some die, others live with memories and fears that haunt them for years to come. Like Uli Derickson, the chief flight attendant on the TWA airliner which was hijacked in 1985 shortly after it left Athens for Rome. Derickson was among those held hostage for 17 days; she witnessed the murder of US navy diver, Robert Dean Stethem and, years later, was still undergoing psychotherapy.</p> <p>By comparison, the hijack experience of the Reverend Timothy Kinahan, a protestant minister from Belfast, was - thankfully - relatively minor. It was seven years ago - almost to the day. It was scary at the time; then it became the stuff of dinner-party conversation - an anecdote to surprise and entertain. But still, more than most of us, he probably has a degree of insight into the fears of those victims of the latest hijack drama to hit the world's headlines.</p> <p>In Kinahan's case, there were no shots fired, no passengers killed, no tricky demands for the release of political prisoners. But for 11 hours, he didn't know if he would live or die. He didn't know if he would ever see his wife and child again. His wife, suspecting she was pregnant with their second child, didn't know if she would ever have the opportunity to tell him the happy news.</p> <p>Kinahan, 46, rector of St Dorothea's Church, was on his way to visit an orphanage in Ethiopia with three members of his congregation. They had boarded flight LH592, a Lufthansa Airbus, in Frankfurt and were bound for Addis Ababa via Cairo. About 45 minutes into the journey they noticed the plane bank steeply and seem to turn around, so that - Kinahan thought - passengers would get a particularly fine view of the Alps.</p> <p>In fact, the aircraft had been commandeered by a 20-year-old Ethiopian hijacker, with a ski-mask over his face and gun in his hand. He took a flight attendant hostage and barged his way into the cockpit, where he put his pistol to the pilot's head and ordered him to change direction and fly to New York</p> <p>The first the passengers knew about the drama was when an announcement was made first in German. Kinahan, a non-German speaker, listened uncomprehending but saw one of the flight attendants go pale. Then it was repeated, this time in English. \"Ladies and gentlemen, there's a young gentleman on board who does not want to go to Cairo and he has a gun pointed at my head,\" the pilot told passengers.</p> <p>\"It was scary,\" Kinahan recalled yesterday. \"We were stunned. There was no panic. There was no screaming, no abject terror. I can remember some tears in the beginning, but our anxiety was not for ourselves, but for those we would leave behind.</p> <p>\"We didn't talk very much for an hour. Then we began to relax quite a bit when nothing happened. There was a great mutual support. At least we did not have crazy gunmen running up and down the aisles threatening us.\"</p> <p>The only time they saw the man who was to bring terror to the flight was as he was making his way to the toilet where he assembled the gun which had been smuggled aboard hidden in his hat. The 104 passengers were ordered to remain in their seats and stay calm. There were prayers and anxious moments during a refuelling stop at Hanover - someone in the aircraft had rigged up a listening device so he could hear negotiations as they happened and reported them on to fellow passengers.</p> <p>\"When negotiations were happening there was huge uncertainty sitting on the ground, surrounded by troops and telephoto lenses. The beginning, the first few hours, until we were happily out of Hanover and on our way to America, were the most anxious. We didn't know if we were going to Cuba or Moscow.</p> <p>\"Rumours were running wild as to who it was, we just didn't know the truth. But once we were in the air, we were all able to relax a bit. We were playing cards and scrabble.\"</p> <p>After two or three hours of negotiations the Airbus took off and flew on to New York - there were more prayers on the approach to John F Kennedy airport. \"We were told that if we stayed calm and did as we were told, nothing would happen. The crew were superb - extremely reassuring.\"</p> <p>Once the plane touched down, the hijacker surrendered. There was enormous relief; cheers rang through the aircraft, there were hugs and kisses and tears, until a US SWAT team stormed the plane hunting for possible accomplices. The passengers were ordered to put their heads between their legs while each of them was checked for another half an hour. It was possibly the most terrifying time of the whole ordeal.</p> <p>The hijacker Nebiu Demeke was sentenced to 20 years in prison, despite the discovery that his gun was nothing more dangerous than a starter pistol, capable of firing only blanks, and his unconditional surrender to the FBI at JFK airport.</p> <p>His threats at the time had sounded real enough - at one point during the refuelling stop at Hanover he said he would kill one flight attendant every five minutes if his demands were not met.</p> <p>\"The captain was fantastic. He was the hero of the occasion,\" said Kinahan. (Pilot Gerhard Goebel, it later emerged, played a central role in resolving the crisis, managing to engage the hijacker's trust. He even promised to give him his sunglasses in return for the gun. And at the end of the drama they did the swap. The hijacker left his balaclava and a note saying thank you.)</p> <p>It's an incident that Kinahan has chosen to put behind him. But when he hears of hijacks, there's a frisson of recognition. \"There's a certain sort of 'Oh gosh, I've been there'. I feel for them. Particularly in this case given their long ordeal and here we have people with a political agenda which can be somewhat more uncertain.\"</p> <p>It has not stopped Kinahan flying. After a glass of wine, a debriefing by the FBI and a stopover in a New York hotel, Kinahan and his colleagues flew directly on to Addis Ababa.</p> <p>He continues to fly to Ethiopia every 18 months or so to pursue his charity work. He makes a couple of other flights every year. Having survived one hijack, does he ever worry about the risk of it happening again? Not really. He's a practical sort of man - he's been anxious during internal flights in Ethiopia, which at one time were targeted by hijackers rather more frequently than most other flights elsewhere. But otherwise no.</p> <p>\"Statistically it's freakish. The number of hijacks per flights is so infinitesimal. You have to put things behind you and put it down to experience.\"</p>",

Like Uli Derickson, the chief flight attendant on the TWA airliner which was hijacked in 1985 shortly after it left Athens for Rome. Derickson was among those held hostage for 17 days; she witnessed the murder of US navy diver, Robert Dean Stethem and, years later, was still undergoing psychotherapy. By comparison, the hijack experience of the Reverend Timothy Kinahan, a protestant minister from Belfast, was - thankfully - relatively minor. It was seven years ago - almost to the day. It was scary at the time; then it became the stuff of dinner-party conversation - an anecdote to surprise and entertain. But still, more than most of us, he probably has a degree of insight into the fears of those victims of the latest hijack drama to hit the world's headlines. In Kinahan's case, there were no shots fired, no passengers killed, no tricky demands for the release of political prisoners. But for 11 hours, he didn't know if he would live or die. He didn't know if he would ever see his wife and child again. His wife, suspecting she was pregnant with their second child, didn't know if she would ever have the opportunity to tell him the happy news. Kinahan, 46, rector of St Dorothea's Church, was on his way to visit an orphanage in Ethiopia with three members of his congregation. They had boarded flight LH592, a Lufthansa Airbus, in Frankfurt and were bound for Addis Ababa via Cairo. About 45 minutes into the journey they noticed the plane bank steeply and seem to turn around, so that - Kinahan thought - passengers would get a particularly fine view of the Alps. In fact, the aircraft had been commandeered by a 20-year-old Ethiopian hijacker, with a ski-mask over his face and gun in his hand. He took a flight attendant hostage and barged his way into the cockpit, where he put his pistol to the pilot's head and ordered him to change direction and fly to New York The first the passengers knew about the drama was when an announcement was made first in German. Kinahan, a non-German speaker, listened uncomprehending but saw one of the flight attendants go pale. Then it was repeated, this time in English. \"Ladies and gentlemen, there's a young gentleman on board who does not want to go to Cairo and he has a gun pointed at my head,\" the pilot told passengers. \"It was scary,\" Kinahan recalled yesterday. \"We were stunned. There was no panic. There was no screaming, no abject terror. I can remember some tears in the beginning, but our anxiety was not for ourselves, but for those we would leave behind. \"We didn't talk very much for an hour. Then we began to relax quite a bit when nothing happened. There was a great mutual support. At least we did not have crazy gunmen running up and down the aisles threatening us.\" The only time they saw the man who was to bring terror to the flight was as he was making his way to the toilet where he assembled the gun which had been smuggled aboard hidden in his hat. The 104 passengers were ordered to remain in their seats and stay calm. There were prayers and anxious moments during a refuelling stop at Hanover - someone in the aircraft had rigged up a listening device so he could hear negotiations as they happened and reported them on to fellow passengers. \"When negotiations were happening there was huge uncertainty sitting on the ground, surrounded by troops and telephoto lenses. The beginning, the first few hours, until we were happily out of Hanover and on our way to America, were the most anxious. We didn't know if we were going to Cuba or Moscow. \"Rumours were running wild as to who it was, we just didn't know the truth. But once we were in the air, we were all able to relax a bit. We were playing cards and scrabble.\" After two or three hours of negotiations the Airbus took off and flew on to New York - there were more prayers on the approach to John F Kennedy airport. \"We were told that if we stayed calm and did as we were told, nothing would happen. The crew were superb - extremely reassuring.\" Once the plane touched down, the hijacker surrendered. There was enormous relief; cheers rang through the aircraft, there were hugs and kisses and tears, until a US SWAT team stormed the plane hunting for possible accomplices. The passengers were ordered to put their heads between their legs while each of them was checked for another half an hour. It was possibly the most terrifying time of the whole ordeal. The hijacker Nebiu Demeke was sentenced to 20 years in prison, despite the discovery that his gun was nothing more dangerous than a starter pistol, capable of firing only blanks, and his unconditional surrender to the FBI at JFK airport. His threats at the time had sounded real enough - at one point during the refuelling stop at Hanover he said he would kill one flight attendant every five minutes if his demands were not met. \"The captain was fantastic. He was the hero of the occasion,\" said Kinahan. (Pilot Gerhard Goebel, it later emerged, played a central role in resolving the crisis, managing to engage the hijacker's trust. He even promised to give him his sunglasses in return for the gun. And at the end of the drama they did the swap. The hijacker left his balaclava and a note saying thank you.) It's an incident that Kinahan has chosen to put behind him. But when he hears of hijacks, there's a frisson of recognition. \"There's a certain sort of 'Oh gosh, I've been there'. I feel for them. Particularly in this case given their long ordeal and here we have people with a political agenda which can be somewhat more uncertain.\" It has not stopped Kinahan flying. After a glass of wine, a debriefing by the FBI and a stopover in a New York hotel, Kinahan and his colleagues flew directly on to Addis Ababa. He continues to fly to Ethiopia every 18 months or so to pursue his charity work. He makes a couple of other flights every year. Having survived one hijack, does he ever worry about the risk of it happening again? Not really. He's a practical sort of man - he's been anxious during internal flights in Ethiopia, which at one time were targeted by hijackers rather more frequently than most other flights elsewhere. But otherwise no. \"Statistically it's freakish. The number of hijacks per flights is so infinitesimal. You have to put things behind you and put it down to experience.\"",

Ismail Khan's rule was famous for its tolerance and stability. Most warlords at the time were known merely for their violence and rapacity. However, Khan was a popular leader who inspired strong loyalty in the men who fought for him.

After the defeat of the communist regime led by Najiballah in 1992 and the withdrawal of Soviet forces, Khan strengthened his position as unopposed warlord in the Herat region. He was credited with beginning the post-war rebuilding process in the area and in 1994 held another \"shura\" or conference of mujahideen political and religious leaders to decide on the government of the country.

Reluctantly, I explain that, with the operation on my deviated septum scheduled for Friday, I need to get my affairs in order. Rebecca asks what I mean. \"For God's sake, isn't it bloody obvious what I mean? I mean, er, I have to, um . . .\" I have no idea what I mean. Getting affairs in order is what wealthy people say in films. I have nothing to leave anyone except a humidor full of cigars, an overdraft and a stethoscope. </p> <p> <strong> Wednesday</strong> </p> <p>Just when my fears about Friday's sub-muchosal resection are at peak intensity, a reader rings to advise me from experience against conventional surgery, but to go for laser surgery instead. Done under local anaesthetic, it is, says Sean Carey, quicker and less troublesome, and he gives me the number of a Harley Street clinic where a French surgeon called Kumami performs his own laser method. It does sound good, and I am paralysed with indecision. </p> <p><strong> Thursday</strong> </p> <p>The paralysis has passed. This morning, I called the Charing Cross hospital's day surgery unit to cancel the op - and then rang the clinic for an appointment. On Monday, I am to see a \"counsellor\" called Mercer to be appraised for laser surgery. </p> <p><strong> Friday</strong> </p> <p>When I call my physician Sarah Jarvis to tell her what is not happening this morning, and to discuss lasers, she is much less cross than I expect. She didn't know they use lasers for this, she says, but if the method is as effective in improving breathing as the conventional one (which has an 85% success rate), she supposes it makes sense. </p> <p>\"What is this place in Harley Street?\" she asks. \"The Sleep Disorder Clinic.\" \"Mm,\" says the doctor, reflectively. \"Mmmmmm.\" </p> <p><strong> Saturday</strong> </p> <p>My friend Jonathan calls to check on my post-operative condition, and I fill him on in the news. \"This place in Harley Street,\" he says, \"It's not the Sleep Disorder Clinic is it?\" \"Why?\" \"I went there once about my snoring,\" says Jonathan, whose mobile signal is beginning to crack up, \"and saw someone calchcchhhcrings and a permccchhhh London cabbie.\" \"I'm sorry, I didn't get all of that,\" I say, when he emerges from a tunnel, \"did you just say that this 'counsellor' chap looked like a London cabbie?\" \"No I didn't.\" \"Thank Christ for that.\" \"What I said,\" Jonathan goes on, \"was that he was a London cabbie.\" </p> <p><strong> Sunday</strong> </p> <p>I awake from an untroubled night, reflecting anew on just how little protection hypochondria offers against serious illness. Yesterday evening, I went to a Battersea fringe theatre, the Grace, to see A Lump in My Throat, an adaptation of the writings of John Diamond, who was a hypochondriac of genuine class before he fell ill with throat cancer. It was excellent - often funny, often moving, cleverly adapted and staged, and performed with a fitting artlessness - and afterwards in the bar, John came over while I was intriguing some people with news of my septum. \"Oh yes, what is happening with that?\" he asked, his eyebrows congregating in obvious concern. And, in great detail, I told him all about my septum. Am I being fanciful, or could there be the stirrings of a little irony buried here somewhere? </p> <p><strong> Monday</strong> </p> <p>At 98 Harley Street, in one of those over-ostentatious waiting rooms (does anyone ever play the grand piano?), I fill in a form, struggling as usual over \"How is your general health?\" and finally settling on \"Very average, thank you.\" Eventually, a stout middle-aged man with a very tight perm comes in and leads me off into the world's smallest lift, and up to his rather gloomy office. </p> <p>At first Mr Mercer mistakenly believes I want the soft palate operation to correct snoring - something Rebecca would be all for. </p> <p>\"I don't suppose, if you have both the septum and the snoring done,\" I say, hoping to puncture the facade of a serious consultation with a dart of flippancy, \"that you get a reduction for bulk?\" Mr Mercer doesn't smile. \"Yes,\" he says. \"Separately they add up to \u00a32,280, but have them together and it's only \u00a32,000.\" </p> <p>As Mr Mercer runs through his patter, I interrupt with questions. What, for instance, is the success rate? \"Success rate?\" Mr Mercer is shocked - or not so much shocked as hurt and offended by the implication that it might not work every single time. \"Success rate? I'm telling you, it's perfect.\" And what about side-effects and possible complications? He stares at me disbelievingly, as if I have just asked him if he likes the dinner jacket that the alligator asleep on my head is wearing. </p> <p>\"You're just looking for problems where there aren't any,\" says Mr Mercer. \"I told you, it's perfect. I've had it done, my son's had it done . . . \" </p> <p>Another thing is bothering me, though: if the laser is so good and so much cheaper than conventional surgery (patients are in and out in half an hour, with no need for day beds), why does no NHS hospital use it? \"Well, we're the only people in the country who know how to do it,\" he says. \"So you think we're going to train NHS people?\" </p> <p>Mr Mercer is wearing a thick gold wedding ring with a large diamond embedded in it. It must be a lucrative business, flogging laser surgery. \"Well, we do other things. I've got a nice slimming pill in from America,\" says Mr Mercer, referring to an unlicensed drug with a name like Subbuteo. \"I've lost a stone and a half since Christmas.\" What does it do, then? Raise the heart rate? \"I think so.\" So it's an amphetamine? \"An amphetamine? No, I told you, it's a pill.\" </p> <p>As we chat on, I warm all the time to Mr Mercer's magnificent transparency, and am genuinely sorry when he draws the interview to a close by arranging for me to be \"assessed\" by a Dr Alexander Williams (a specialist? \"I think so. he's a doctor\") for \u00a385 - a fee that comes off the price of the op should I have it. </p> <p>I leave 98 Harley Street and take a long walk, and return for the 1.30pm appointment to be told that the doctor is running an hour late. After I make a mild fuss, to my amazement the \u00a385 is refunded, and I take my leave of the Sleep Disorder Clinic for what will, I suspect, be the last time.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It has been a bad few months for the pioneers of gene therapy. The frontier medical technology has been in the news for the wrong reasons. A little over a decade ago, when the first gene therapy trials involving human subjects were sanctioned, the more optimistic scientists and biotech investors hoped that by now the first effective treatments for previously incurable diseases would have appeared on the horizon. </p> <p>It hasn't happened. Not one of the hundreds of past or present gene therapy experiments has yet turned up anything resembling a cure. And a series of disturbing revelations from the US, following the death last September of one gene therapy guinea pig, 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger, has exposed the entire field to accusations of negligence, expediency and putting profit before safety. </p> <p>The response of gene therapy's backers - dogged researchers, biotech firms and thousands of people desperate for sick and dying family members to have their raised hopes met - is the same: be patient, and don't damn the whole programme over the reckless behaviour of a few US scientists. </p> <p>Gene therapy covers a multitude of techniques with one thing in common. They all involve manipulating a cloned version of a naturally-occurring gene and introducing it into the human body in order to combat a disease. </p> <p>The techniques have something else in common: they are all extremely difficult. The principle is simple enough - often, it is a case of trying to replace abnormal genes in a patient with normal ones. The very vocabulary used to try to explain the process for lay people, filled with words like \"delivering\" genes and \"packaging\" genes, makes it sound like a straightforward postal operation. The reality is more extreme - something like trying to replace a single component in all the cars and trucks in a city a thousand miles away while the vehicles are moving. </p> <p>There are between 5,000 and 8,000 diseases, ranging from the well-known such as cystic fibrosis to obscure ailments affecting a handful of people, for which a defective gene or set of genes is responsible. As scientists first began to tie particular gene mutations with particular illnesses, hopes soared that a way would be found to swap faulty genes for good ones. The hopes remain, but they have now been tarnished by experience. </p> <p>Cystic fibrosis seemed like one of the prime candidates for successful gene therapy, and since the defective gene was identified in 1989, about 150 volunteer sufferers - including dozens in the UK - have been administered with doses of \"proper\" genes. On a molecular level, researchers measured slight, short-term improvements, but as one commented last year: \"A cure is not around the corner.\" The problem is getting the replacement genes to the cells in the lungs that are malfunctioning. The disease generates a thick mucus that forms a barrier to delivery, which is often by means of a spray. </p> <p>\"Thus far, the level of correction hasn't been strong enough or lasted long enough to get clinical benefits,\" says Dr Martin Scott of the Cystic Fibrosis Trust in the UK. </p> <p>The difficulty of getting \"good\" genes to the place in a patient's body where they are needed, and the sheer frustration of researchers at the slow pace of research, seems to have been behind Gelsinger's death. </p> <p>Scientists at the previously respected Pennsylvania Institute for Gene Therapy violated a string of federal and in-house rules to recruit and use the unsuitable Gelsinger as a volunteer in their studies of gene therapy treatment for a liver disorder. And they used a particularly risky technique of delivering the \"good\" genes - putting them inside a modified cold virus and injecting it into Gelsinger's bloodstream. </p> <p>Last month federal regulators shut down all the institute's gene research trials. Last week, it emerged that 652 out of 691 cases of \"serious adverse events\" in US gene therapy trials had not been properly reported. Most of those whose illness worsened or who died were terminally ill. But there is concern that, in the US at least, commercial pressures on scientists to get results is leading them to use the inevitable deaths of guinea pigs as an excuse to cut corners. </p> <p>In Britain, scientists seeking to carry out gene therapy research on patients have to get permission from two agencies - the gene therapy advisory committee, GTAC, and the medicines control agency, the MCA. </p> <p>Since it was set up in 1992, GTAC has consented to 40 gene therapy studies, involving 260 volunteers, most of them linked to treatment for cancer. Researchers are required to report to GTAC on any death or deterioration in a trial patient's condition whether the gene therapy itself was thought to be the cause or not. </p> <p>A department of health spokesman says there has never been \"unexpected serious side effects\" from British gene therapy trials. None of the British gene therapy studies has used the method tried by the Pennsylvania researchers, although viruses have been used as packages to get genes to their destination. Indeed, many of the British scientists have less ambitious aims than that of actually replacing faulty genes with working ones. </p> <p>In Glasgow, they are trying to treat head, neck and ovarian cancer by modifying a virus's own genes to turn it into a cancer killer. At Guy's Hospital in London, trials have been completed in a four-country study of gene therapy for breast cancer. The idea is to give patients injections of a virus modified to carry two human genes. One gene labels tumour cells as enemies; the other marshals specialist cells to destroy them. </p> <p>A British biotech company, Oxford Biomedica, is funding research at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford into what are called \"prodrugs\". Again, the aim is not to replace faulty genes, but to use genes as part of treatment - in this case, to trigger an anti-cancer chemotherapy drug exclusively in a tumour, rather than having it reach the tumour after travelling through the rest of the body first. </p> <p>The work at Guy's and the Churchill highlights the irony of gene therapy's current stained reputation - that up until now, whether it worked or not, it has always seemed like a relatively safe, uncomplicated treatment. As one researcher put it, \"Patients love it.\" Compared to standard chemotherapy drugs, which provoke side effects like baldness and nausea, the quick injection or spray of a gene therapy medium is a breeze. The question is whether some researchers did not become too casual in their assumption that delivery of the genes was always going to be harmless. </p> <p>But British scientists insist that, whatever happened in the US, it isn't happening here. \"We have a very high level of monitoring and control,\" says Oxford Biomedica's chief executive, Dr Alan Kingsman. \"The important thing to get out of what's happened in the US is that the bad things which have happened there are much more to do with procedure than with the technology. What we really must not do is sacrifice the field because of bad procedures in the US.\" </p> <p><strong> The inherited diseases that gene therapy could cure</strong></p> <p><strong> Cystic fibrosis</strong> </p> <p>Affects about 7,000 people in the UK. One in 25 people is a carrier of the faulty gene. The disease causes a thick mucus to build up in the lungs which, along with other symptoms, impairs breathing. Medical improvements have pushed average survival age up to adulthood, but the disease still cuts life drastically short, usually from respiratory failure. </p> <p><strong> Muscular dystrophy</strong> </p> <p>A family of disorders caused by abnormal genes. The most common form affects about one in 15,000 male births. Muscles progressively waste away, with death normally in the late teens or early 20s. Identification of the gene responsible has made diagnosis straightforward even before symptoms develop but scientists are wary of seeking a gene therapy to treat it; it appears that working genes would somehow need to be introduced into every affected cell, a daunting task. </p> <p><strong> Huntington's disease</strong> </p> <p>About one in 10,000 people have the faulty gene that causes this degenerative nerve disease. It usually appears between the ages of 35 and 40. Involuntary muscle movements and dementia usually lead to death within 10 years. </p> <p><strong> Haemophilia</strong> </p> <p>A disease that prevents normal blood clotting, causing a major crisis even from the most minor injury. The defective gene that causes the disease is passed by father to daughter; the daughter doesn't suffer from it, but becomes a carrier. Researchers have recently announced encouraging results from gene therapy trials to combat haemophilia. </p> <p><strong> Epidermolysis bullosa</strong> </p> <p>One of thousands of extremely rare genetic disorders waiting for a gene therapy miracle, the faulty gene here fails to hold skin together properly. Skin comes off when rubbed; parents cannot pick up their children. One in every 20,000 UK babies is affected. </p>",

Involuntary muscle movements and dementia usually lead to death within 10 years. Haemophilia A disease that prevents normal blood clotting, causing a major crisis even from the most minor injury. The defective gene that causes the disease is passed by father to daughter; the daughter doesn't suffer from it, but becomes a carrier. Researchers have recently announced encouraging results from gene therapy trials to combat haemophilia. Epidermolysis bullosa One of thousands of extremely rare genetic disorders waiting for a gene therapy miracle, the faulty gene here fails to hold skin together properly. Skin comes off when rubbed; parents cannot pick up their children. One in every 20,000 UK babies is affected.",

      "body": "<p>You have to admire Marian Richardson's chutzpah. One Saturday afternoon the condom she and her boyfriend were using split. She became pregnant. Four years on, little daughter by her side, she's just tried - and failed - to sue Durex for \u00a3120,000. Most of us, however conscientious, have been there (though litigation might seem extreme): suddenly sobering up to realise that \"devil-may-care\" wasn't the best contraceptive choice. </p> <p>At times like these, a quick, painless solution would be a godsend. A pill, for instance, in your bathroom cabinet, that you could swallow straight away to stop yourself getting pregnant. Of course, it does exist: the \"morning-after\" pill, which has been around for 20-odd years. The drawback is that to get it you have to visit your doctor. Preferably within 12 hours of having sex, although 72 will do. </p> <p>According to the Family Planning Association, a startling 47% of all pregnancies in Britain are unplanned and yet we have 13 different methods of contraception to chose from. Either we're a nation of bumbling idiots, or something is putting us off contraception. </p> <p>When it comes to emergency contraception, this could well be the thought of your stern family doctor demanding to know, \"What, exactly, went wrong?\" Or it could be that getting to the surgery in time wasn't possible (most of us would probably chance it rather than spend our bank holiday weekend skulking in the local A&amp;... ). Or perhaps it's because taking the morning-after pill is yukky: you get nauseous, and often vomit. </p> <p>For this reason alone the release last Wednesday of a new morning-after pill, Levonette-2, is good news. The traditional pill, PC4 (the one that's been used since the 70s) con tains two hormones: oestrogen, the \"female\" hormone, responsible for things like breasts and ovulation, and progestogen, which prepares the womb to receive a fertilised egg. It's the oestrogen that makes you sick. Levonette-2 is a breakthrough because it contains only progestogen. So you don't get sick. </p> <p>In fact, there are no side effects, no medical contra-indications and it is no stronger than the contraceptive pill that women used to take every day. The best news, though, is that Levonelle-2 prevents 85% of expected pregnancies if taken within 72 hours. PC4 prevents only 57%. It's also simpler: you take two pills 12 hours apart, rather than the four (two then two 12 hours later) you take of PC4. </p> <p>But how, exactly, does it work? According to Dr Anne Webb, consultant in family planning and reproductive health at the Abacus Service in Liverpool, \"nobody really knows\". What's certain, though, is that a dose of progestogen (or progestogen and oestrogen) will alter a woman's menstrual cycle. It can delay ovulation, or prevent it for a month. </p> <p>It can alter the lining of the womb, so that a fertilised egg will not implant there. Or it may change the environment of the womb so that sperm aren't transported so efficiently. Basically, says Webb \"it's like a spanner stuck in the works: it scuppers your normal cycle\". </p> <p>Some people claim that taking the morning-after pill is like having an early abortion. The first thing to remember is that although you may be panicking, your egg may not have been fertilised - emergency contraception is about reducing risks. Still, strictly speaking, as Toni Belfield, director of information at the Family Planning Association explains, \"those who believe life begins when the sperm meets the egg, and not when the egg implants itself in the womb might not chose this method\". </p> <p>However, once a pregnancy has been established - the fertilised egg has implanted into the womb - the morning-after pill can't stop it. \"I could give it to a pregnant woman every day for a week and absolutely nothing would happen,\" says Webb. </p> <p>So why can't we keep a pack handy in case we, or some rubber company, mess up? Last year in England and Wales, nearly 200,000 women had abortions. </p> <p>Anything that reduces this number should surely be promoted. \"Emergency contraception shouldn't replace regular contraceptive methods - it's less reliable,\" says Belfield, \"but increasing access to it through pharmacies would help prevent unplanned pregnancies and reduce the number of abortions.\" </p> <p>Manchester Health Action Zone is currently running a pilot study to see if this is feasible. They've made the morning-after pill available though 16 specially trained pharmacies. You may think that discussing your contraceptive failure in front of your GP is marginally preferable to doing so before several grannies at your local chemist. But as Beverly Parkin, spokesperson for the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, says: \"Discretion is a big issue in pharmacy today.\" Gentle questioning \"in a private area of the shop\" would go hand in hand with \"advice on safe and reliable regular contraception\". </p> <p>But some claim that wider availability will encourage teenage girls to cast off their knickers without a thought for the consequences. Certainly the morning-after pill offers no protection from sexually transmitted diseases. </p> <p>But, says Belfield, \"there is absolutely no evidence that a more widely available emergency contraceptive would encourage teenagers to have unprotected sex.\" In fact, it's twenty-somethings we should be worried about. \"The highest number of unplanned pregnancies in this country are in women aged between 20 and 25,\" she says. </p> <p>Indeed, the average age of those using the Manchester service - 23 - bears this out. In the US Levonelle-2 goes under the rather more catchy name of \"Plan B\". Currently, if you don't want to get pregnant, you choose from a range of pills, have injections or implants, use any number of barriers, even pee on sticks to check your hormones; so there's really no excuse for fecklessness. But accidents will happen. A couple of pills might have spared Marian Richardson hours in court. As for the rest of us, it never hurts to have a plan B, does it?</p>",

      "body": "<p>I've lost one voice and found another. When I had my larynx removed after being diagnosed with oral cancer, I was left completely mute. But four months ago I began using my electronic voicebox and it has now become my lifeline. </p> <p>My illness was first diagnosed during a routine check-up by the dentist. He spotted a lesion at the back of my throat: it turned out to be cancer of the soft palate. My best-known character, Uncle Mort, from my 70s BBC1 comedy series I Didn't Know You Cared, was convinced he had cancer after drinking the spring water from his allotment; now the joke was on me. </p> <p>I had a successful operation to remove the lesion, but three years later, in 1998, I woke up one morning and found an enormous lump the size of a hen's egg in my neck. I thought, \"Bloody hell, this is it.\" </p> <p>I had been separated from my actress wife Liz Goulding for a year, but when I rang and told her about the lump, she came with me to Guy's Hospital, where they gave me an endoscope under anaesthetic by inserting a camera down my throat. I was told I had cancer of the neck and that it was also surrounding the larynx. </p> <p>I was offered the option of a laryngectomy, surgery to remove the larynx. In a desperate attempt to save my voice, I opted for the less radical treatment of a neck dissection to take out the lump, plus six-and-a-half months of radiotherapy, which was bloody awful. </p> <p>That October, I had a mild stroke and couldn't live on my own any more. Lizzie is now my full-time carer, for which she is paid \u00a339.95 a week by the state; she also acts as my interpreter if people can't understand what I say through the voicebox. </p> <p>In January 1999, I had a check-up with Mark McGurk, professor of maxillofacial surgery at Guy's. He puffed some cocaine up my nose to anaesthetise it and then endoscoped me. The cancer had spread during the radiotherapy, which hadn't retarded it, so there was no option but to have my larynx out in February. There's not a lot left of my neck now after two dissections. </p> <p>Being mute was total torture, because, like all Liverpudlians, I'm a chatterbox. And the only way I could have a conversation was by writing on a child's Magic Marker board. I felt totally isolated, as if I wasn't part of the human race. </p> <p>The two operations had removed quite a bit of my tongue and also my jugular vein, which puts extra pressure on the smaller veins in my neck. And after the laryngectomy, I had every post-op complication you can possibly get. One day last March, Lizzie came home to find me outside the back door and covered in blood. She said the house looked like a murder scene - I had staggered out of the bathroom after starting to haemorrhage. To all intents and purposes, I was dead, but the paramedics found a faint pulse in my neck and I was resuscitated in Kingston Hospital after six hours. </p> <p>In June, I had another haemo-rrhage, and they gave me a total blood transfusion this time. I had an escort of three police cars to get me to Guy's in 20 minutes: it was wonderful, typical of a dramatist to make such a scene. Then I got an infection from the blood and became extremely weak for a while. </p> <p>My speech therapist gave me a terrible bollocking last year for not practising with the small metal voicebox they had given me, but I was just too ill. Now I carry the box around in one hand and suck on the long plastic tube attached to it, holding the tube at exactly the same angle I always used for my pipes. It's rather like a hookah. I had smoked pipes for 40 years, and in many ways they were responsible for my cancer. </p> <p>I'm 63 now, but I feel about 263. I take 42 prescription drinks to keep up my weight because I can't eat a lot. Having very little tongue means I have great difficulty in swallowing; and after the radiotherapy, I don't produce enough saliva to break down all the food. </p> <p>I used to speak very quickly, and the voicebox has forced me to slow down. It's a bloody nuisance, because my brain works faster than my voice. But as Uncle Mort would say, I don't want to be accused of showing off. </p> <p>I'm a New Orleans and Chicago jazz fan, and I can simulate scat-singing with my voicebox; it makes a musical twanging sound like a jew's-harp. It's very Heath Robinson, and it gives me the speaking voice of a Dalek. Lizzie hated it and couldn't cope with it at first; as she puts it, there was a lot of grieving going on for the voice that was no longer there. </p> <p>But women tend to be better at deciphering voicebox speech than men, although my nine-year-old nephew can understand me perfectly because children listen to a lot of electronic voices. And my two lovebirds, Hazel and Sid, respond to its harmonics by tweeting back. It's my friend and my enemy; its correct name is a Cooper-Rand machine, but I usually call it That Fucking Thing because I tend to mislay it. </p> <p>My writing is even more important to me now; it's the only way I can communicate properly. For those years while I was mute, it was only my writing that kept me going: I sat at the computer and found the writing voice that had disappeared for 10 years. I had spent a decade writing absolute crap for TV, synopses and pilots that never got put on. It's totally soul-destroying and it dries up the creative juices, but I needed the money. Now, however, I'm happy with what I'm writing for theatre and radio. </p> <p>\u0095 Peter Tinniswood's latest play, On The Whole It's Been Jolly Good, which stars Leslie Phillips, runs until February 12 at Hampstead Theatre.</p>",

An hour later, just before midnight, British air traffic control was told the plane was heading for England. The police were informed and alerts went out to the government and military bodies trained to deal with such emergencies. Members of the Whitehall committee set up for dealing with such emergencies - Cobra - were bleeped. A 15-man SAS team based at Stirling Lines, in Hereford, equipped with concussion grenades, Heckler and Koch sub-machine guns and body armour, was almost certainly also called in. The duty clerk at Downing Street phoned Tony Blair at 1am to inform him that Britain was about to become involved in the complex and bloody politics of Afghanistan. Wider than the internal politics of that country, Mr Blair will also have to attempt to re-establish the credibility of the international community's re sponse to hijacking. The hardline policy of refusing to negotiate had survived well for 20 years, after the chaos created by Palestinian terrorists in the 1970s. But that policy was badly undermined by the India's decision in December to release three prisoners after one of its planes was hijacked and taken to Afghanistan. The latest crisis began at 5.30 yesterday morning, British time, when a plane belonging to Ariana, Afghanistan's battered national carrier, took off from the Afghan capital Kabul heading for the northern city of Mazar-e- Sharif.

It was at Tashkent that the hijackers disclosed their demand - the release of Ismail Khan, the man dubbed the Lion of Herat in the Afghan battle against the Russians but now imprisoned by Afghanistan's Taliban government. The plane stopped again at Aktyubbinsk, Kazakstan, and then Moscow, where more passengers were released and the plane was refuelled. And then it flew on to Britain. Stansted airport had dealt with its last scheduled flight for the night when staff got word late on Sunday that the hijacked plane could be heading its way. There had been rumours that the hijackers were heading for London throughout Sunday evening but Essex police say they were first aware that the plane may be coming to Stansted at about 11.30pm on Sunday - half an hour after the last flight. The decision on whether it should be allowed to land rested with the the duty foreign office minister, John Battle. A Whitehall source said: \"He had to make the decision but he had little choice.

It is understood, though not officially confirmed, that the hijackers wanted to go to Heathrow but were diverted to Stansted, which has been for some years the designated London airport for hijacking incidents. By 1am Essex police knew the plane was coming their way and a well-practised operation was put in place, initially under the control of Deputy Chief Constable Charles Clark. The plane, with 165 people on board, landed at 2.01am to the south of the airport in an area known as Compass Base. The passengers had already been on board for 21 hours. The plane was barely visible in the dark - and even once daybreak came it was difficult for observers half a mile away to see what was going on on the ground. Just as invisible was the decision-making in Whitehall. Overall responsibility rests with Cobra, a special committee named after the place where it meets, a secure cabinet office briefing room. The team comprises members of the government's civil contingencies unit, activated - by being bleeped - to coordinate security emergencies. Cobra is made up of senior civil servants from the home office, the foreign office and the transport department as well as MI6, MI5, and Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch, It is chaired by the senior home office official. At 10am, Mr Blair was briefed by the head of the civil service, Sir Richard Wilson, and had meetings with the home secretary, Jack Straw. Although the home office is in charge of the crisis, it is primarily an operational matter and Mr Straw will continue with his other duties, while being kept regularly informed. At 3.45am Deputy Chief Constable Clark held his first press conferences in a building near the main Stansted terminal. He confirmed that police negotiators were in contact with the hijacked plane. \"Priority is the safe release of those on board ... it is calm on the aircraft and conditions are good.\" Taking a studious approach, negotiators agreed to allow the delivery of a generator to allow air conditioning on the plane at 6.30am, and at the same time soft drinks, tea bags, toilet rolls and baby food were handed over. As passengers started to ar rive at Stansted for flights due to begin at 7am, Ryanair, the airline scheduled to take the largest number of planes out of Stansted, cancelled all its morning flights. Very quickly 2,000 people were facing delays inside the airport. At 9.15am John Broughton, Assistant Chief Constable of Essex, said he was aware that media reports in Britain may be being monitored by the hijackers, a factor which helped explain his cautious briefings through the day. But he added: \"It is not the UK policy to let [hijacked] aircraft take off again once landed.\" Asked if the army or SAS were on standby Assistant Chief Constable Broughton said carefully: \"There is a full range of resources available.\" Police confirmed that a doctor in Essex had been consulted on a hostage who was suffering a kidney complaint. At 11.40am five hostages, two men both 26, a 17-year-old woman and two very small children were let off the plane by the hijackers. The children, the woman and one of the men were from the same family. They appeared to have been treated well. Three hours later, another three hostages - two women and one man - were released. They too seemed in a reasonable condition despite the stress of 33 hours on the 727. In return the Stansted authorities handed over grilled fish, roast chicken, soft drinks and bread. But they were still negotiating about providing extra supplies of water and emptying the plane's toilets. A representative of the Taliban government General Rahmatulla Safi visited Stansted to say the Taliban regime would not negotiate with the hijackers. Gen Safi, who said he had once spent a year at the SAS headquarters in Hereford when he was in the Afghan Royal Army said: \"The hijackers were foolish to come to Britain because the forces that they are dealing with are absolutely professional.\" Journey from Kabul Sunday February 6 05.30 GMT Boeing 727, Ariana Airlines flight from Kabul in Afghanistan to Mazar-e-Sharif is hijacked 08.30 Plane lands in Uzbekistan's capital, Tashkent.

The unprecedented 107-month period of uninterrupted US economic growth gives Mr Clinton a dream election year scenario in which he is able to use a growing budget surplus to pay off debt and reduce taxes, while still promising more spending on social programmes which appeal to voters. \"The new economic policy, as we all now know, has helped to create a new economy,\" said Mr Clinton, claiming credit for the longest growth and the lowest unemployment in the US in more than 30 years. \"Seven years ago when I took office, we had had 12 years of big deficits, a quadrupling of the national debt that had led to high interest rates and low growth,\" the president said. \"We changed the course.\" Exactly nine months before the election to choose his successor, Mr Clinton hopes that his budget's combination of strict fiscal discipline and increased spending on health, education and pensions programmes will provide a winning platform for Vice President Al Gore and enable the Democratic party to regain control of the US congress in November.

      "bodyText": "Afghan terrorists released an adult male hostage shortly after 2.30pm today from the hijacked Boeing 727 at Stansted airport. The hostage complained of feeling ill and was allowed to leave the jet after a period of intense police negotiation. Witnesses said they saw a figure wearing mustard-coloured clothing and a head scarf descend from a ladder at the rear of the jet and walk towards two police armoured Land Rovers. A police spokesman refused to disclose any more details at a press conference half an hour later. Negotiators working to free more than 150 hostages held on board have begun discussing \"issues\" which could lead to an end to the crisis, police disclosed this morning. However, senior police officers stressed that the hijackers had so far made no specific political demands during more than 31 hours of negotiations. \"There have been no specific requests other than for food, water and medication - what we would term house-keeping requirements,\" Essex assistant chief constable John Broughton told a news conference at the airport. \"It has always been our intention to seek a safe resolution without anybody getting hurt and we are working towards that,\" he added. A total of 157 people, including 21 children, 17 women, 14 crew and an unconfirmed number of hijackers, remained on board the aircraft today after spending their first full night on the ground at the Essex airport. The jet, operated by Afghan carrier Ariana, touched down shortly after 2am yesterday following a flight lasting almost 24 hours across the former Soviet Union and Western Europe. The English-speaking gunmen seized the aircraft on Sunday morning shortly after it had taken off on a domestic flight from the Afghan capital, Kabul, for a flight of less than an hour to the provincial city of Mazar-e-Sharif. Essex police denied that a news blackout had been imposed on any details of political demands made by the hijackers, who were earlier reported to have requested the release of Ismail Khan, a key opposition figure jailed in 1997 by the Taliban, Afghanistan's ruling Muslim fundamentalist regime. \"We are not being evasive, there have been no specific demands. But issues have been talked about generally, there have been broad issues talked about,\" said an Essex police spokeswoman. At about 8am a police vehicle drove out to the isolated concrete apron where the jet has been held since touch-down to deliver a breakfast of mushrooms and omelette to those on board. Earlier, a second electricity generator was delivered to the plane after a generator delivered yesterday began to fail. Mr Broughton said it appeared that the hostages appeared to be receiving good treatment from their captors, but said conditions on the plane after three days would be difficult. \"We are obviously concerned for the comfort and welfare of those on board,\" he said. \"They have now been on board for some considerable time and obviously we want to make the negotiations as comfortable as possible. \"Conditions must be very difficult but we are told the atmosphere is calm and that the negotiations are business-like.\" It also emerged that police, as well as delivering food and sanitary supplies, had also made available medication for stomach upsets being suffered by some of those on board the jet. Meanwhile, police were expected to continue debriefing the hostages who were released in two batches yesterday as they worked to gain further intelligence about the hijackers.",

Fifteen civilians were reported wounded in the Israeli strikes. Large areas of Lebanon plunged into darkness because of the damage to the power grid or as a precautionary shut down of installations to protect them from further damage. The capital, Beirut, the town of Baalbek in the eastern Bekaa Valley and the cities of Sidon and Tyre in the south were blacked out for most of the night. Power was gradually restored to some areas. Electricity Minister Suleiman Traboulsi imposed severe rationing, saying damage to the power grid was heavy and estimated losses exceeded \"many times\" the $25 million destruction caused by similar air strikes in June. The Israeli army said the attacks were in response to \"the severe escalation in the activities of Hezbollah and other organisations in south Lebanon\". Also today, Israel said it will no longer honor an agreement on avoiding targeting civilians when it retaliates against the Hezbollah. Cabinet minister Haim Ramon said Israel's reprisal will be harsher than the latest bombings if Hezbollah fires rockets into northern Israel. Hezbollah has been fighting to drive the Israelis out of a security zone they established in southern Lebanon in 1985 to protect the country's northern settlements from cross-border guerrilla attacks. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has said he will vacate the occupied area by July. Ramon said the deadline will still be met, and perhaps even advanced. Lebanon cannot match the Israeli military, but Muslim guerrillas have often fired Katyusha rockets on Israel in response to severe Israel air strikes. On Monday night, people in border Israeli areas were ordered to move into bomb shelters and residents fled the oft-hit town of Kiryat Shemona in convoys. A Hezbollah statement said the guerrillas \"reserve the right to retaliate at the appropriate time which could come very soon.\" The statement, Hezbollah's first comment on the air strikes, did not say if it suffered any losses from a raid in which two missiles were fired on a Hezbollah base in Baalbek . But damage could not be ascertained because the area was cordoned off by Lebanese security police and Hezbollah officials. The neighborhood also houses a Hezbollah television relay station. Three other missiles struck a power station on the edge of the town, setting the facility ablaze and plunging the town into darkness. Fifteen people, including four women and four children, living in nearby houses were injured by flying glass and debris. Some houses in the area cracked and shop shutters were blown off. \"All we can remember is that we were hit and now we are here,\" said one of the injured, 18-year-old Ibrahim Noon, who suffered cuts in his legs and arms. He spoke at a local Baalbek hospital where he and his mother, 50-year-old Siham, were being treated. Prime minister Salim Hoss said Israel will not succeed in forcing the Lebanese to abandon their demands to regain territory occupied by the Jewish state in southern Lebanon. The official media in neighboring Syria, which is the main power broker in Lebanon, said continued Israeli action would plunge the region into destruction. \"Mistaken is Barak if he thinks that escalating the tone of intimidation and threat ... would salvage his government from its intractable impasse in Lebanon,\" the Al-Baath newspaper said in an editorial.

      "body": "<p>La nouvelle fait grand bruit: le groupe p\u00e9trolier fran\u00e7ais Elf-Aquitaine aurait vers\u00e9 plus de 100 millions de francs afin de financer la campagne \u00e9lectorale d'Helmut Kohl en 1994. Ce serait, d'apr\u00e8s un proche collaborateur de Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, l'ancien pr\u00e9sident fran\u00e7ais lui-m\u00eame qui aurait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Elf de faire ce geste envers un 'grand Europ\u00e9en'. L'amiti\u00e9 qui liait les deux hommes \u00e9tait bien connue mais cette affaire de financement occulte du CDU jette le discr\u00e9dit sur un homme consid\u00e9r\u00e9 au-dessus de tout soup\u00e7on. L'ex-chancelier allemand d\u00e9ment ce qu'il qualifie d' inventions pures et simples et de mensonges et assure que cette affirmation n'est rien d'autre qu' un appel au meurtre politique. Il certifie qu' il n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 question d'argent entre lui et Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. Nous avons demand\u00e9 \u00e0 trois jeunes Fran\u00e7ais ce qu'ils pensaient de cette affaire et, plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, comment ils percevaient les relations franco-allemandes.</p> <p><b> Quels sentiments vous inspirent les r\u00e9v\u00e9lations concernant l'aide apport\u00e9e par F. Mitterrand \u00e0 H. Kohl?</b></p> <p><b> Virginie, 18 ans, lyc\u00e9enne:</b> En politique, le financement occulte de partis est monnaie courante. Mitterrand et Kohl \u00e9taient de vieux amis. Ils partageaient les m\u00eames convictions: pas \u00e9tonnant que Mitterrand lui ait donn\u00e9 un coup de pouce de 100 millions pour qu'il reste au pouvoir!</p> <p><b> Nadia, 19 ans, \u00e9tudiante:</b> Rien n'est s\u00fbr mais c'est louche! Pourtant, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, Kohl n'avait pas besoin de \u00e7a puisque les Allemands allaient certainement voter pour lui. On est tous tomb\u00e9s de haut car on le croyait irr\u00e9prochable.</p> <p><b> Mathias, 18 ans, lyc\u00e9en:</b> \u00c7a ne m'\u00e9tonne pas. Il y a tellement de magouilles en politique. Mitterrand et Kohl \u00e9taient unis comme les doigts de la main. Ensemble, ils ont fait de l'Europe ce qu'elle est aujourd'hui. Mitterrand avait tout int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 ce que Kohl reste en place.</p> <p><b> Globalement, comment d\u00e9finiriez-vous les rapports franco-allemands ?</b></p> <p><b>Virginie:</b> Les relations \u00e9conomiques France/Allemagne ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 bonnes. L'Allemagne, pendant longtemps, a tir\u00e9 la France vers le haut. Depuis Chirac et Jospin, on parle moins de l'Allemagne et plus de l'Angleterre. Entre Fran\u00e7ais et Allemands en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, les relations sont plut\u00f4t bonnes, gr\u00e2ce aux \u00e9changes scolaires et jumelages, m\u00eame si le nombre de Fran\u00e7ais parlant allemand diminue puisque tout le monde parle anglais!</p> <p><b> Nadia:</b> Je me sens plus proche des Anglais, m\u00eame si, avec la crise de la vache folle et l'embargo, les relations diplomatiques de la France sont meilleures avec l'Allemagne qu'avec l'Angleterre.</p> <p><b>Mathias:</b> Tr\u00e8s bons. En fait, l'amiti\u00e9 de Mitterrand et Kohl a permis aux deux pays de se rapprocher. L'Europe s'est en partie construite gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la France et \u00e0 l'Allemagne. On ne peut pas dire que les Anglais aient fait beaucoup d'efforts de ce c\u00f4t\u00e9-l\u00e0.</p> <p><b> Comment percevez-vous les Allemands, avec leurs qualit\u00e9s et leurs d\u00e9fauts, par rapport aux Fran\u00e7ais ?</b></p> <p><b> Virginie:</b> En vacances en Tunisie, j'ai vu que les Allemands \u00e9taient sans-g\u00eane, comme si tout leur \u00e9tait d\u00fb. Ils arrivent en terrain conquis! Ils sont souvent distants, r\u00e9serv\u00e9s, et pas tr\u00e8s raffin\u00e9s, contrairement aux Fran\u00e7ais. Et qu'est-ce qu'ils picolent ! N\u00e9anmoins, ils sont plus ouverts aux nouveaut\u00e9s, en musique, par exemple. Ils ont organis\u00e9 des f\u00eates telles que la techno parade et la love parade bien avant nous.</p> <p><b> Nadia:</b> En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, les Allemands sont riches et savent profiter de la vie.

      "bodyText": "La nouvelle fait grand bruit: le groupe p\u00e9trolier fran\u00e7ais Elf-Aquitaine aurait vers\u00e9 plus de 100 millions de francs afin de financer la campagne \u00e9lectorale d'Helmut Kohl en 1994. Ce serait, d'apr\u00e8s un proche collaborateur de Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, l'ancien pr\u00e9sident fran\u00e7ais lui-m\u00eame qui aurait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Elf de faire ce geste envers un 'grand Europ\u00e9en'. L'amiti\u00e9 qui liait les deux hommes \u00e9tait bien connue mais cette affaire de financement occulte du CDU jette le discr\u00e9dit sur un homme consid\u00e9r\u00e9 au-dessus de tout soup\u00e7on. L'ex-chancelier allemand d\u00e9ment ce qu'il qualifie d' inventions pures et simples et de mensonges et assure que cette affirmation n'est rien d'autre qu' un appel au meurtre politique. Il certifie qu' il n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 question d'argent entre lui et Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. Nous avons demand\u00e9 \u00e0 trois jeunes Fran\u00e7ais ce qu'ils pensaient de cette affaire et, plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, comment ils percevaient les relations franco-allemandes. Quels sentiments vous inspirent les r\u00e9v\u00e9lations concernant l'aide apport\u00e9e par F. Mitterrand \u00e0 H. Kohl? Virginie, 18 ans, lyc\u00e9enne: En politique, le financement occulte de partis est monnaie courante. Mitterrand et Kohl \u00e9taient de vieux amis. Ils partageaient les m\u00eames convictions: pas \u00e9tonnant que Mitterrand lui ait donn\u00e9 un coup de pouce de 100 millions pour qu'il reste au pouvoir! Nadia, 19 ans, \u00e9tudiante: Rien n'est s\u00fbr mais c'est louche! Pourtant, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, Kohl n'avait pas besoin de \u00e7a puisque les Allemands allaient certainement voter pour lui. On est tous tomb\u00e9s de haut car on le croyait irr\u00e9prochable. Mathias, 18 ans, lyc\u00e9en: \u00c7a ne m'\u00e9tonne pas. Il y a tellement de magouilles en politique. Mitterrand et Kohl \u00e9taient unis comme les doigts de la main. Ensemble, ils ont fait de l'Europe ce qu'elle est aujourd'hui. Mitterrand avait tout int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 ce que Kohl reste en place. Globalement, comment d\u00e9finiriez-vous les rapports franco-allemands ? Virginie: Les relations \u00e9conomiques France/Allemagne ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 bonnes. L'Allemagne, pendant longtemps, a tir\u00e9 la France vers le haut. Depuis Chirac et Jospin, on parle moins de l'Allemagne et plus de l'Angleterre. Entre Fran\u00e7ais et Allemands en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, les relations sont plut\u00f4t bonnes, gr\u00e2ce aux \u00e9changes scolaires et jumelages, m\u00eame si le nombre de Fran\u00e7ais parlant allemand diminue puisque tout le monde parle anglais! Nadia: Je me sens plus proche des Anglais, m\u00eame si, avec la crise de la vache folle et l'embargo, les relations diplomatiques de la France sont meilleures avec l'Allemagne qu'avec l'Angleterre. Mathias: Tr\u00e8s bons. En fait, l'amiti\u00e9 de Mitterrand et Kohl a permis aux deux pays de se rapprocher. L'Europe s'est en partie construite gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la France et \u00e0 l'Allemagne. On ne peut pas dire que les Anglais aient fait beaucoup d'efforts de ce c\u00f4t\u00e9-l\u00e0. Comment percevez-vous les Allemands, avec leurs qualit\u00e9s et leurs d\u00e9fauts, par rapport aux Fran\u00e7ais ? Virginie: En vacances en Tunisie, j'ai vu que les Allemands \u00e9taient sans-g\u00eane, comme si tout leur \u00e9tait d\u00fb. Ils arrivent en terrain conquis! Ils sont souvent distants, r\u00e9serv\u00e9s, et pas tr\u00e8s raffin\u00e9s, contrairement aux Fran\u00e7ais. Et qu'est-ce qu'ils picolent ! N\u00e9anmoins, ils sont plus ouverts aux nouveaut\u00e9s, en musique, par exemple. Ils ont organis\u00e9 des f\u00eates telles que la techno parade et la love parade bien avant nous. Nadia: En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, les Allemands sont riches et savent profiter de la vie. Ils adorent faire la f\u00eate avec un bon gueuleton de choucroute et saucisses. Ils ne sont pas sexy pour un sou! Mathias: Je les vois stricts, rigoureux, bosseurs, \u00e9colos, et respectueux des autres. En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, ils sont sympas. Quand ils sont bourr\u00e9s, ils ne deviennent pas agressifs et bagarreurs comme les Anglais. Comment pensez-vous que les jeunes Allemands r\u00e9agissent au souvenir de la Seconde Guerre Mondiale? Virginie: On ne peut pas leur reprocher les fautes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 commises par les g\u00e9n\u00e9rations pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes. Ils sont g\u00ean\u00e9s d'en parler car il faut toujours qu'ils justifient ce qui s'est pass\u00e9. On n'oubliera jamais mais il ne faut pas leur jeter la pierre.

      "bodyText": "The government last night suffered a heavy defeat in the Lords over plans to reverse laws banning local authorities from promoting homosexuality, despite its attempts to push a compromise obliging schools to promote marriage as the \"fundamental building block of society\". An amendment tabled by the former Conservative leader of the Lords, Baroness Young, to retain the controversial section 28 was passed by 210 votes to 165, a majority of 45. A handful of Labour peers also rebelled against a government whip to oppose plans in the local government bill for repeal of the clause, which have already set Downing Street on collision course with church leaders and family campaigners. Following committee stage confrontation, ministers will now seek to replace bald proposals for the scrapping of the clause with a compromise measure designed to reassure those who fear that the removal of a law barring \"promotion\" of homosexuality will inevitably lead to \"proseltysation\" over gay lifestyles. They hope to build on a defusing amendment proposed yesterday by the Bishop of Blackburn, the Rt Rev Alan Chesters, which would place a legal duty on schools to promote marriage in sex education lessons. The amendment, later withdrawn by the bishop but supported by many Labour and Liberal Democrat peers and by local government minister Lord Whitty during the debate, also underlines the right of pupils to grow up free from physical or verbal bullying over sexual orientation, and from pressure to have sex. The mainstream gay and lesbian campaign group Stonewall last night made clear it could live with such a change. Though it was not put to the vote, ministers believe it could win over some who opposed repeal of section 28 last night. The amendment also chimes closely with the underlying principles of government guidance on sex education, disclosed yesterday by the education and employment secretary David Blunkett. Teachers would have no role in promoting any sexual orientation, Mr Blunkett said. The guidance, to be published before Easter, would set out that \"pupils should be taught about the importance of marriage, family life, love and stable relationships in bringing up children\". The bishop's amendment says that \"marriage should be promoted as the fundamental building block of society and of family life and as the proper context for the nurture of children\". Many Labour peers, however, last night supported the scrapping of section 28. Lord Alli, the only openly gay peer, accused supporters of the clause of having the same \"morality of hate\" as the bomber who blew up a gay pub in Soho, central London. \"If you want to know how such evil exists in society, it's because we teach our children to hate,\" he said. Lady Young, who last week unveiled a collection of material she claimed was \"propaganda\" used by local authorities and health authorities to \"promote\" homosexuality, argued that there was no moral equivalence between homosexual and heterosexual relationships. She told peers: \"To say to children there are alternatives in life which are equally valid is not right and one needs to be very careful what one says to vulnerable children, growing up, uncertain of the way.\" Lady Young said she supported the Bishop of Blackburn's aim in promoting marriage, but his amendment failed to prevent councils from promoting homosexual relationships. The bishop withdrew his committee stage amendment after Lord Whitty said the government would debate the issues with the church before the bill's report stage. Lord Whitty said: \"Society as a whole does include the gay community, whether you approve of their behaviour or not. It does include an awful lot of people who depart from the ideal of marriage. \"The law has an obligation to treat adults equally and to treat children fairly so that they understand this complicated world. I believe the way forward is to engage in a wider discussion and decide whether we can put a form of words on the statute book.\"",

      "bodyText": "The governor of Sudbury prison has been suspended and a disciplinary investigation ordered into his behaviour, the prison service announced last night. The dramatic move is thought to have been taken after the governor, Nigel Salter, repeatedly clashed with a senior prison service manager over the running of his jail. Mr Salter, whose open prison in Derbyshire has been highly praised, has been suspended, it is believed, because he was \"too bolshie\" in his attitude towards his temporary area manager, Ian Lockwood, over a series of minor but important issues about the running of the jail. Prison service sources put the dispute down to a personality clash lasting many years. The suspension of prison governors is extremely rare. They have one of the few occupations left in the public sector which commands a large degree of autonomy, going back to Victorian times. But they have seen that independence eroded over the last 10 years as the prison service headquarters has gradually asserted a much stronger central managerial influence. The suspension of Mr Salter is the first since Michael Howard and Derek Lewis clashed over the then home secretary's decision to suspend the governor of Parkhurst high-security prison after the breakout there in the early 1990s. The prison service last night confirmed that Mr Salter had been suspended last Friday pending a disciplinary investigation but emphasised that it did not involve matters of a criminal nature. A deputy governor has taken over the day to day running of the prison. It is believed that the clash between Mr Salter and Mr Lockwood covered a series of management and personnel issues at the prison, which holds 500 inmates, including 63 serving life terms. Some 75% of the inmates at Sudbury are serving time for drug related or violent offences. Matters came to a head over Mr Salter's plans for the temporary release of inmates over Christmas. He wanted to interpret the rules to get the prison roll down as low as possible. But Mr Lockwood told him that he had interpreted the rules too liberally and instructed him to the change the policy. Mr Salter is believed to have obeyed the area manager, but not without an argument. After a series of such incidents, Mr Lockwood complained to the prison service deputy director-general, Phil Wheatley who ordered an investigation under the internal code of discipline. None of the incidents is believed to individually involve a breach of prison service regulations but their cumulative effect appears to have sparked a clash between the two men. It is believed that an official complaint was made which alleged that the accumulation of incidents amounted to a series of question marks against Mr Salter's professional judgment as a governor. It is the first time that matters of judgment have been the subject of a disciplinary investigation in the prison service. But the decision to suspend Mr Salter is still something of a mystery. Only last week the prisons minister, Paul Boateng, threatened to use such unprecedented action against governors of \"failing prisons\" but it is widely recognised that the Sudbury governor has done a very good job since he arrived there in 1992. Sir David Ramsbotham, the chief inspector of prisons, published a glowing inspection report in 1998 and said that Sudbury was \"a thriving establishment carrying out good work with prisoners\".",

      "trailText": "<p>The Beach is likely to make as much of an impact on the music charts as the box office charts. Boyd Farrow unravels the synergy of film and soundtrack</p>",
      "byline": "Boyd Farrow",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In a few weeks' time a song called Pure Shores by All Saints will be blaring out from every in-store DJ booth, car stereo and pub jukebox. Every person who owns two lips will be humming the tune as they work, rest and aerobicise. And when Pure Shores is eventually knocked off its number one spot it will probably be replaced by the soon-to-be equally ubiquitous Voices by Dario G, featuring Vanessa Quinones. You see, both these songs feature on the soundtrack of The Beach, a movie that looks set to make more of an impact on the music charts than the box office charts. </p> <p>These days it's as important for a movie to have a hit soundtrack as it is to have, well, Leonardo DiCaprio in the starring role. And the creative team behind The Beach know this better than most. After all, they made Trainspotting, a movie that got Middle America mainlining on Leftfield and Underworld and put the careers of Lou Reed and Iggy Pop, not to mention Blur, back on track.</p> <p>Of course, Leo comes to the party with an proven track record himself: Baz Lurhmann's Romeo + Juliet gave Des'ree her finest moment with \"Kissing You\" while Titanic boasted the far more dubious distinction of turning skeletal Canadian warbler Celine Dion into a Streisand for the '90s. </p> <p>Soundtracks are one of the most powerful marketing tools available to movie producers - think The Bodyguard, Pretty Woman and Dirty Dancing - and there is an almost forensic attention to detail when selecting individual tracks. Sometimes it is the film's director who obsesses about the music featured (stand up Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino) sometimes the movies themselves inspire the soundtrack, such as in the case of The Full Monty, but far more often it is a corporate decision. After all, the movie soundtrack is a booming industry in its own right and the multimedia titans that own film studios also own record companies. Madonna enjoyed a number one hit, not to mention a career boost, with Beautiful Stranger, from Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. Seldom was a song more ironically titled: Austin Powers was produced by New Line Cinema, part of the AOL Time Warner empire which also bankrolls her own record label Maverick. </p> <p>Equally ironic is the fact that Trainspotting was financed by PolyGram Filmed Entertainment - which, until it was folded into Universal, was part of the world's biggest record company. Yet the Trainspotting soundtrack was provided by PolyGram's then rival EMI. This embarrassing lack of synergy occurred when PolyGram rejected the offer to put out the soundtrack for Shallow Grave (the Trainspotting production team's previous film) and so EMI jumped in.

      "bodyText": "In a few weeks' time a song called Pure Shores by All Saints will be blaring out from every in-store DJ booth, car stereo and pub jukebox. Every person who owns two lips will be humming the tune as they work, rest and aerobicise. And when Pure Shores is eventually knocked off its number one spot it will probably be replaced by the soon-to-be equally ubiquitous Voices by Dario G, featuring Vanessa Quinones. You see, both these songs feature on the soundtrack of The Beach, a movie that looks set to make more of an impact on the music charts than the box office charts. These days it's as important for a movie to have a hit soundtrack as it is to have, well, Leonardo DiCaprio in the starring role. And the creative team behind The Beach know this better than most. After all, they made Trainspotting, a movie that got Middle America mainlining on Leftfield and Underworld and put the careers of Lou Reed and Iggy Pop, not to mention Blur, back on track. Of course, Leo comes to the party with an proven track record himself: Baz Lurhmann's Romeo + Juliet gave Des'ree her finest moment with \"Kissing You\" while Titanic boasted the far more dubious distinction of turning skeletal Canadian warbler Celine Dion into a Streisand for the '90s. Soundtracks are one of the most powerful marketing tools available to movie producers - think The Bodyguard, Pretty Woman and Dirty Dancing - and there is an almost forensic attention to detail when selecting individual tracks. Sometimes it is the film's director who obsesses about the music featured (stand up Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino) sometimes the movies themselves inspire the soundtrack, such as in the case of The Full Monty, but far more often it is a corporate decision. After all, the movie soundtrack is a booming industry in its own right and the multimedia titans that own film studios also own record companies. Madonna enjoyed a number one hit, not to mention a career boost, with Beautiful Stranger, from Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. Seldom was a song more ironically titled: Austin Powers was produced by New Line Cinema, part of the AOL Time Warner empire which also bankrolls her own record label Maverick. Equally ironic is the fact that Trainspotting was financed by PolyGram Filmed Entertainment - which, until it was folded into Universal, was part of the world's biggest record company. Yet the Trainspotting soundtrack was provided by PolyGram's then rival EMI. This embarrassing lack of synergy occurred when PolyGram rejected the offer to put out the soundtrack for Shallow Grave (the Trainspotting production team's previous film) and so EMI jumped in. As a reward for its support, EMI was given worldwide rights to the Trainspotting soundtrack - which grossed nearly \u00a310m worldwide and even spawned a sequel to the soundtrack. In a way EMI is even set to benefit from the soundtrack of The Beach. Since the film's backer, 20th Century Fox, is the only Hollywood studio that doesn't own a record label, The Beach's soundtrack has been licensed to WEA/SIRE, part of AOL Time Warner.

      "body": "<p>In June 1997, a rumour went round Oxford that the budget for one of the big college's summer balls was a quarter of a million pounds. To anyone not involved, the idea that a committee of students, whose business experience turned on selling mugs through Young Enterprise and balancing tabs at the bar, could be put in charge of a such a major sum was hilarious. In February 2000, there is a rumour going round about two first-year students who are poised to float their online revision service on the stock market next month for a figure 10 times the ball budget. This time, however, nobody is laughing. </p> <p>The small but growing number of students setting up companies from their college bedrooms is beginning to make the activities of the ball committee look like Fisher Price finance. There can scarcely be an undergraduate alive who has not been grinding their teeth over the fortunes of <a href=\"http://www.Student-Net.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">Student-Net.co.uk</a>, the online service founded by four finalists at Nottingham Trent university that attracted a \u00a310m investment from a US firm of venture capitalists last month. </p> <p>Hardly a day seems to go by without a report of some new bright spark making his first million before passing his A levels. <a href=\"http://www.CyberBritain.com\" target=\"_new\">CyberBritain.com</a>, the fastest growing online network in Europe, has a 17-year-old chief executive. And last week, Oxygen, a firm of financiers set up to fund student business ideas, was valued on its first day of trading at a mind-boggling \u00a3240m, more than double the annual turnover of Nottingham Trent university. </p> <p>This is more than another breathless chapter in the saga of the e-commerce boom; it marks a very real shift in the culture of student life, where not long ago even the most ambitious undergraduate was content to chisel the perfect CV out of captaining a university club, doing work experience at Goldman Sachs and honing his self-importance in the union debating chamber. </p> <p>\"When I was at college, ambitious students saw university as a time to burnish their CVs by being president of the debating society, and so on,\" says John McLaren, the 48-year-old non-executive director of Groupe Chez Gerard, which owns a string of restaurants across Britain. \"Then, the key skill for a student was to position yourself at the moment of graduation so that you got an A-stream job where you could move up a monolithic system.\" McLaren did this by getting a summer job at a demolition company and embroidering it with the same canny self-promotion as his fellow students. </p> <p>Today, it seems, you are an also ran if you haven't made your first million by the time you graduate. \"In the current economic climate, when the cost of education has risen substantially, everybody who goes to university views it as an investment in themselves,\" says Alan Edmondson, 22, one of the founding members of Student-net, a sort of web version of the student union handbook. He and the other three - Peter Atalla, the 21-year-old who came up with the idea, Michael Haycock, 23, and John Woodcock, 22 - are among the first generation of students who have had to pay for their degrees and it has had a galvanising effect on their productivity. \"Students in America have long had to work their way through college, which teaches them a certain business discipline,\" says McLaren, and so it is now in Britain. </p> <p>With the help of the \u00a310m capital injection from IMPG, a Nevada-based venture capitalist, the four Student-net founders have opened two offices in Nottingham, two in London and are taking on 15 new people over the next fortnight. Edmondson's attitude towards his staff is revealing. \"Since we've started employing people ourselves, we've realised how valuable we are in the marketplace,\" he says. \"I interviewed someone today who was a law graduate with a 2:1 and a masters in business, but he didn't have a clue.\" </p> <p>Edmondson's casual self-assurance comes from an industry in which there is no received wisdom to accumulate and no rites of passage to slog through; this is a gold-rush panic in which youth is valued above experience. \"It wasn't seriously possible to start a business when I was at college,\" says McLaren. \"Without computers and the internet, what could you do apart from a glorified paper round? And where would you go for funding, because the bank sure as hell wouldn't lend a student the money.\" </p> <p>Step forward Oxygen, or rather, Emma Edelson, the 26-year-old daughter of Michael Edelson, the Manchester United director with whom she set up the company to specialise in financing student projects. Members of the board include PR executive Matthew Freud and Keith Harris, former chief executive of HSBC Investment Bank. From an initial investment of \u00a31m in five start-up companies, it floated on the stock exchange last Friday for \u00a3240m. \"It isn't a case of students thinking, oh my god, I've got all this studying to do and my business to set up,\" says Edelson. \"It generally grows out of having fun and spotting a gap in the market.\" </p> <p>Since starting six months ago, Oxygen has received more than 100 business plans, half of them from students. Some package their ideas professionally, others ignore the protocols and pitch themselves, shakily, over the phone: both are acceptable. \"The problem for students with business ideas has always been that unless you have a business plan and partnership agreements, you will not be taken seriously,\" says Edelson. \"You don't have the time or knowledge to find out how everything works.\" </p> <p>The difference in today's climate, is that students with no practical experience in running a business, will still be courted for the value of their unrefined ideas. \"There is a shake-up in people's attitude to age generally,\" says McLaren. \"The fact that they have seen 23-year-olds successfully run internet companies, has shown how little age should be a determinant in giving people responsibility.\" </p> <p>Benjamin Cohen is 17. When he was 13, he was diagnosed with ME and was forced to spend long periods of time confined to his home in north London. \"I hadn't been into the internet much before that, but I started using it as a way of keeping in touch with the world. I realised how powerful it was for reaching people at low cost.\" </p> <p>Cohen, like a lot of teenage programmers, began idly constructing a website around his interests. With a \u00a3150 loan from his father, he bought the domain name <a href=\"http://www.JewishNet.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">JewishNet.co.uk</a> and when he stumbled across the email address for the chairman of the Durlacher Corporation, a colleague of his father's and the financial backer behind the hugely successful Soccernet, Cohen secretly sent him a pr\u00e9cis of the site. Durlacher phoned the boy's father and advised him to broker a deal. In eight weeks time, JewishNet will be floated on the Alternative Investment Market and Ben Cohen will start revising for his A levels. </p> <p>The manner in which Cohen came to be the chairman of two sizeable companies (the other being CyberBritain.com, a rudimentary search engine that is none the less growing faster than any other online network) at 17 years old, is typical of a student business ethic that views work as the natural extension of recreation. \"A lot of the ideas that come in have been conceived at the pub over a drink,\" says Edelson. </p> <p>'Now that the whole concept of a monolithic career is starting to go, what matters more is personal networks,\" says McLaren. The combination of youth and success isn't new, of course, but it has been more common in acting or writing, areas that tolerate a certain amount of precocious immaturity. For the student entrepreneurs, however, there can be no allowances made for youthful caprice. Shareholders require a level of constancy that it is hard to imagine a first-year student putting up with. \"The thought of having all this potential money on our shoulders puts us under huge pressure,\" says Rose. \"Once the venture capitalists have invested, they're going to want to see something more than just Jordan and me running the company.\" </p> <p>Rose and Mayo are having an untypical first year at university. Rose, studying politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford's Lady Margaret Hall, is woken by the phone each morning at 9am. He goes to lectures during the day, writes business plans at night, and spends one day a week, usually a Thursday, in London with Mayo - who is reading economics and management at Hertford College. On March 20, during the Easter holidays, the pair plan to launch their on-line revision service, revise.it, built out of the proceeds from the sale of their last company. On a typical day in London, they will attend their first meeting at 10am and have subsequent meetings - with fundraisers, advertisers and marketing managers - every hour until 7pm. </p> <p>\"Our general self-confidence has helped and we have motivated each other,\" says Rose. \"But there are loads of young people who have cool, creative ideas. The only difference is that our idea came at a time when we had the summer after A levels to work on it.\" </p> <p>There is more to it than luck, however. Two years ago, translating a student business idea into a bona fide company would have been almost impossible, as Robert Jenkins found to his cost. When he was a second year economist at Jesus College, Cambridge, he had an idea. The 19-year-old was already a seasoned entrepreneur, having speculated his student loan on the stock market and made enough money to fund his degree. But when he made a tentative pitch to City financiers, he was laughed out of the room. \"I approached a few venture capitalists and they wouldn't really open the door to a student. I didn't know how to present a business plan or anything.\" </p> <p>Jenkins retreated, licking his wounds, and after graduation worked for Deutsche Bank for nine months until he had gained the right skills to resubmit his idea - an investment web service he is wary of detailing before the launch. At 22, he has been taken on by Oxygen and is preparing to launch yellowturtle.com in March with a business partner who is still at university. \"If I had been able to launch this service three years ago, it would have blown everything else away,\" he says regretfully. \"It is still a solid idea, but back then it was revolutionary. You have to do this things when you think of them, because in a year or two, they won't be competitive.\" </p> <p>\"There is a certain window of time for these entrepreneurs to make their mark,\" says Emma Edelson. \"The capital valuations are crazy and I'm pretty sure the bubble will burst.\" </p> <p>Getting in quick has its disadvantages. Apart from trying to juggle management meetings with Descartes essays, Rose has been the target of some snide comments in the college laundry room. \"Someone said, 'oh, I don't think internet millionaires did their own washing.' We're having to cut down significantly on social life, but hopefully when we get backing, we'll be able to bring in a manager.\" </p> <p>\"Certain members of staff didn't take it particularly pleasantly that the boss was 17 years old,\" says Cohen. His diffidence triggers a rare concession to the fact that he isn't 45. \"I'm having to make decisions that I don't really want to.\" Like what, exactly? \"Like, how many desks we should have and what colour the walls should be. Sometimes I think it's pressure I don't really need.\"</p>",

We're having to cut down significantly on social life, but hopefully when we get backing, we'll be able to bring in a manager.\" \"Certain members of staff didn't take it particularly pleasantly that the boss was 17 years old,\" says Cohen. His diffidence triggers a rare concession to the fact that he isn't 45. \"I'm having to make decisions that I don't really want to.\" Like what, exactly? \"Like, how many desks we should have and what colour the walls should be. Sometimes I think it's pressure I don't really need.\"",

      "bodyText": "Austria's new social affairs minister - a member of J\u00f6rg Haider's far-right Freedom party - has been invited to a European Union meeting in Lisbon this week, it was confirmed last night. Signalling that the EU is now going to play by the book in dealing with a member government that includes the controversial party, Portugal - holder of the union's rotating presidency - announced that Elisabeth Sickl, the minister, would be asked to Lisbon. But a three-day visit to Vienna by Portugal's president, Jorge Sampaio, early next month was postponed indefinitely \"because of the situation in Austria and in accordance with the European Union's position\". The informal Lisbon meeting on Friday was seen as a test of whether multilateral EU business would be affected after Austria's 14 partners froze bilateral contacts with Vienna in response to the Freedom party's inclusion in the coalition government. Limited sanctions now in force include refusing to back Austrian officials running for posts in international organisations and downgrading contacts with Austrian ambassadors in EU capitals. Until last night, no one was certain that normal EU activity could go ahead, especially since informal meetings such as the forthcoming Lisbon gathering occupy a grey area, with ministers attending by invitation of the presidency. Some EU member states, including Belgium, had raised the idea of not inviting Austrian ministers to informal meetings, but a majority of the 14 appear to believe that a clear distinction must be maintained between bilateral and EU business. Chris Patten, the EU's external affairs commissioner, alluded to some of the difficulties when he said last night: \"What's happened in Austria in the last few days has been difficult for a number of member states, partly because of their historic memories and partly because of their nervousness about the consequences for their own political development of irresponsible populism. \"So it's understandable that member states have acted as they have. But the European Union is an organisation of rules and laws and treaties, and we in the [European] commission act as the guardian ... of that legal framework.\" Britain, meanwhile, angrily denied that it shared any political common ground with Mr Haider and said it backed European efforts to isolate the new government in Vienna. \"There is absolutely nothing in common between Mr Haider and Tony Blair,\" insisted the foreign office minister for Europe, Keith Vaz. \"Not in a thousand years is there going to be anything in common between the two gentlemen, or the programmes of his party and the Labour party.\" Mr Vaz was responding to weekend comments in which the Freedom party leader said Britain had been \"more moderate\" than its EU partners in responding to Austria's new government. The silence of British ministers for several days gave the impression that the government was less than happy with the bilateral sanctions, which followed an impassioned appeal to Mr Blair from the Austria's head of state, President Thomas Klestil. For London, it would have been politically impossible to refuse to participate in the show of protest. Mr Haider said Mr Blair's reaction had been tempered by the fact that Britain knew what it felt like to be isolated in Europe. The Freedom party leader was also quoted as saying: \"If you compare our programme with the programme of Tony Blair, you will find a lot of similarities. We have stood for a long time for those values and ideas that Tony Blair stands for too. It is difficult in the new Europe to make a distinction between right and left.\"",

By 1900 it was 10 to one. By 2000 it had risen to 60 to one.\"</p> <p>What could be more natural than that those impoverished by this process should seek to follow to its source the mysterious agent of their dispossession? And what could be more predictable than that those who have gained from these events should seek to prevent them from doing so?</p> <p>The noses of the poor are always pressed against the TV screens of our windowpane. At the touch of a button they can still be made to disappear. It is only when our control becomes less remote, when gaunt, hungry faces from elsewhere appear on our streets, that a more authentic reponse emerges.</p> <p>After all, Europe has contributed spectacularly to the global disturbance of regions and peoples; has, since colonial times, been an agent of vast uprootings, has exported its own migratory spirit, has sought to snuff out all alternative ways of answering need, has filled the world with economic migrants, many of them from within its own borders. The economies of almost every country in the world have been profoundly influenced by western international financial organisations, by transnational companies, by the diktats of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, by our \"democratic institutions\", in which those whose lives are wrecked by them have no say.</p> <p>It is the business of western politicians to ensure that the advantages which its peoples have gained should not be cancelled, while at the same time declaring their abhorrence of xenophobia and racism. They dare not state whose side they are really on. They fret and fume, seeking to halt people at the frontiers of Europe under the pretence of \"the maintenance of good race relations\". What this really means is that the fragile and always threatened privilege of Europe must be defended against the poor; the overwhelmingly black poor.</p> <p>Internationalists are now set against racists. The struggle between rich and poor takes on the aspect of race conflict, because that is its most obvious characteristic. The majority of the downtrodden, the oppressed and humiliated are non-white. What used to be called \"embourgeoisement\" of majorities in Europe and America - of which Tony Blair is the triumphant apostle - has been allied to the pauperisation of majorities in the rest of the world.</p> <p>The European left scarcely distinguishes itself from a right whose faith in global laissez-faire is matched only by an hysterical defence of evaporated sovereignties and atrophied national powers. Those who set the monstrosity of globalisation in train, seek in vain to dissociate themselves from the further effects of their actions.</p> <p>Internationalists confront racists. The identity of internationalists is less clear than that of their opponents, for they, too have been suppressed by all the right-thinking, Right-thinking politicians of Europe, along with the racists who have nevertheless made all the running. Internationalists - some people in the movements for environment and global social justice, some anarchists, some imaginative socialists (if that hasn't become a contradiction in terms), and the majority of human beings, the three billion who, according to Lawrence Summers, \"live on less than two dollars a day\".</p> <p>J \u00f6rg Haider has articulated the issue. This is his real crime. The only thing that distinguishes him from his colleagues in Europe is a lack of tact, a refusal to genuflect to pieties in which few of the leaders of Europe exhibit the remotest belief. How does his response to the \"threat\" from the poor differ from that of those now talking of \"sanctions\" against Austria? The wondering peoples of Asia and Africa can be forgiven if they cannot detect the distinction.</p> <p>The Financial Times expresses its astonishment at a \"ruthless populist who has blatantly exploited anti-immigrant sentiments to gain support\". But it advises against ostracism of a coalition between conservatives and far right in Austria, on the grounds that \"a programme may be formed that is at least economically sound\". We all know what that means.</p> <p>\"Mr Haider's brand of hate has no place in the councils of Europe,\" scolds the Guardian. The politicians of western Europe exaggerate: for in the smiling face of Haider they may read the lineaments of their own policies. And they do not like it.</p> <p>Perhaps our own leaders should pay attention to the readers of the Sun. On the day when Europe was denouncing Austria, the Sun devoted half a page to letters under the heading Labour Lunatics Have Lost Control of Asylum. A few phrases: \"How on earth do we know who we are letting in anyway? We could be welcoming murderers and rapists.\" \"Whatever government is in power seems to have no answer to the mass immigration of people into this country.\" \"Far from fleeing tyranny, most come here for the better life.\" \"If they are so hard done by here they should consider returning to their own country.\" \"Now from April all asylum seekers will be housed and fed. New Labour? Or Monster Raving Loony Party?\" \"Surely they should not receive any benefits or money for five years until they have put something into the country.\" \"Our benefits system is the attraction. Other countries are not the soft touch we are.\" \"When is Jack Straw going to say no to more asylum seekers?\" \"The cure for this is to announce to the world that there is no free money or housing in this country.\" \"When the late Enoch Powell spoke against Britain's immigration policy most of us called him racist. But comparing the situation now, with asylum seekers costing us zillions of pounds to keep, and the vast majority of them bogus, it makes you think he had a point\" \"When is the Labour government going to stop giving money hand over fist to asylum seekers?\"</p> <p>Politics is stranded, archaic, overtaken by the consequences of globalisation. Epic shifts in the world cannot be managed within the creaking ideologies we have inherited; and the shadow of a single integrated economy darkens the disintegrating societies it has created. The world is the site of a civil war in which all humanity is caught up, the war of the rich against the poor, against which conscience objects in vain. Haider knows whose side he is on. The other politicians of Europe know also. But they don't say.</p> <p>Jeremy Seabrook writes on south Asia</p>",

It is only when our control becomes less remote, when gaunt, hungry faces from elsewhere appear on our streets, that a more authentic reponse emerges. After all, Europe has contributed spectacularly to the global disturbance of regions and peoples; has, since colonial times, been an agent of vast uprootings, has exported its own migratory spirit, has sought to snuff out all alternative ways of answering need, has filled the world with economic migrants, many of them from within its own borders. The economies of almost every country in the world have been profoundly influenced by western international financial organisations, by transnational companies, by the diktats of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, by our \"democratic institutions\", in which those whose lives are wrecked by them have no say. It is the business of western politicians to ensure that the advantages which its peoples have gained should not be cancelled, while at the same time declaring their abhorrence of xenophobia and racism. They dare not state whose side they are really on. They fret and fume, seeking to halt people at the frontiers of Europe under the pretence of \"the maintenance of good race relations\". What this really means is that the fragile and always threatened privilege of Europe must be defended against the poor; the overwhelmingly black poor. Internationalists are now set against racists. The struggle between rich and poor takes on the aspect of race conflict, because that is its most obvious characteristic. The majority of the downtrodden, the oppressed and humiliated are non-white. What used to be called \"embourgeoisement\" of majorities in Europe and America - of which Tony Blair is the triumphant apostle - has been allied to the pauperisation of majorities in the rest of the world. The European left scarcely distinguishes itself from a right whose faith in global laissez-faire is matched only by an hysterical defence of evaporated sovereignties and atrophied national powers. Those who set the monstrosity of globalisation in train, seek in vain to dissociate themselves from the further effects of their actions. Internationalists confront racists. The identity of internationalists is less clear than that of their opponents, for they, too have been suppressed by all the right-thinking, Right-thinking politicians of Europe, along with the racists who have nevertheless made all the running. Internationalists - some people in the movements for environment and global social justice, some anarchists, some imaginative socialists (if that hasn't become a contradiction in terms), and the majority of human beings, the three billion who, according to Lawrence Summers, \"live on less than two dollars a day\". J \u00f6rg Haider has articulated the issue. This is his real crime. The only thing that distinguishes him from his colleagues in Europe is a lack of tact, a refusal to genuflect to pieties in which few of the leaders of Europe exhibit the remotest belief. How does his response to the \"threat\" from the poor differ from that of those now talking of \"sanctions\" against Austria? The wondering peoples of Asia and Africa can be forgiven if they cannot detect the distinction. The Financial Times expresses its astonishment at a \"ruthless populist who has blatantly exploited anti-immigrant sentiments to gain support\". But it advises against ostracism of a coalition between conservatives and far right in Austria, on the grounds that \"a programme may be formed that is at least economically sound\". We all know what that means. \"Mr Haider's brand of hate has no place in the councils of Europe,\" scolds the Guardian. The politicians of western Europe exaggerate: for in the smiling face of Haider they may read the lineaments of their own policies. And they do not like it. Perhaps our own leaders should pay attention to the readers of the Sun. On the day when Europe was denouncing Austria, the Sun devoted half a page to letters under the heading Labour Lunatics Have Lost Control of Asylum. A few phrases: \"How on earth do we know who we are letting in anyway? We could be welcoming murderers and rapists.\" \"Whatever government is in power seems to have no answer to the mass immigration of people into this country.\" \"Far from fleeing tyranny, most come here for the better life.\" \"If they are so hard done by here they should consider returning to their own country.\" \"Now from April all asylum seekers will be housed and fed. New Labour? Or Monster Raving Loony Party?\" \"Surely they should not receive any benefits or money for five years until they have put something into the country.\" \"Our benefits system is the attraction. Other countries are not the soft touch we are.\" \"When is Jack Straw going to say no to more asylum seekers?\" \"The cure for this is to announce to the world that there is no free money or housing in this country.\" \"When the late Enoch Powell spoke against Britain's immigration policy most of us called him racist. But comparing the situation now, with asylum seekers costing us zillions of pounds to keep, and the vast majority of them bogus, it makes you think he had a point\" \"When is the Labour government going to stop giving money hand over fist to asylum seekers?\" Politics is stranded, archaic, overtaken by the consequences of globalisation. Epic shifts in the world cannot be managed within the creaking ideologies we have inherited; and the shadow of a single integrated economy darkens the disintegrating societies it has created. The world is the site of a civil war in which all humanity is caught up, the war of the rich against the poor, against which conscience objects in vain. Haider knows whose side he is on. The other politicians of Europe know also. But they don't say. Jeremy Seabrook writes on south Asia",

The customer analysis capabilities of Broadbase will be joined with US-based Calico's e-commerce software, which lets companies sell complex products and services over the net, the companies said. \u0095 Dance A site dedicated to hip-hop and rap music, Darkerthanblue.com, is set to announce today it is raising \u00a33m through a private placing and planning to float next year.

      "bodyText": "The government is to boycott a new United Nations convention on returning stolen cultural artefacts to prevent Britain having to return the Elgin marbles to Greece. The decision, announced yesterday by Chris Smith, the culture secretary, will mean that Britain will clash with the UN over complaints from many African and Asian countries as well as Greece that the retention of their treasures is one of the last remnants of cultural imperialism. It will also fuel speculation that Tony Blair is determined to take a hard line over the 184-year controversy surrounding the acquisition of the Elgin marbles by the British Museum after it became clear before Christmas that he had ruled out reopening the issue before the next election. Ministers are said to fear that returning the marbles could lead to other galleries and museums having to return masterpieces. Britain's decision is in line with the rest of the European Union and the United States which are refusing to sign the new convention because of the treasures they hold in their top museums, from the Louvre to the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art. Countries that have backed the resolution include Afghanistan, Bolivia, Cambodia, Canada, China, Egypt, the Congo, Haiti, Hungary, Macedonia, Madagascar, Malawi, the Marshall Islands, Mongolia, Morocco, Nigeria, Peru, Syria and Togo. Mr Smith, whose department was unable last night to expand on the issue, said yesterday in a reply to Labour MP Stephen Pound: \"After a lengthy inter-departmental consultation, I have concluded that the UK should not become a signatory to the Undroit convention due to conflicts with our current law. \"In order to implement the convention, changes to our limitation periods and to our personal property would be required, resulting in a special regime for cultural objects and arguably a less generous position for original rightful owners of objects which are later stolen.\" Mr Smith has promised to consider options for alternative legislation which could implement some of the provisions. Mr Smith's position looks at odds with the convention itself which calls for bilateral negotiations between countries over the return of works of art rather than ordering any country to hand over the antiquities. It does however commit the UN to an inventory of works of art which would be a big process. The government has been embarrassed by the revival of the row over the Elgin marbles, triggered originally by a decision of the Commons culture, media and sports committee to look at the issue again this year. The British Museum also angered the Greeks when the Guardian revealed that it lent out the Duveen galleries - which house the marbles - for costume parties, including people who wished to dress up as ancient Greeks and Egyptians. It also came under fire when it was forced to release documents at a symposium last December which revealed that the marbles had been damaged when they were inexpertly scraped and cleaned 60 years ago. The museum covered this up at the time and had refused to make public the documents. MPs are likely to press Mr Smith for a full explanation for the government's decision, particularly when the culture, media and sports committee looks at the issue.",

They were trying to destroy the rebels before they were able to return to protracted partisan warfare. A day after Vladimir Putin, Russia's acting president, declared that Grozny had finally been \"liberated\" five months into the war, the Russian air and ground assault concentrated on the approaches to the rebels' mountain redoubts in the south. They also targeted the flat lands of western Chechnya, where many rebels were thought to be hiding. The Russian war spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, claimed that Russian forces had cut off fleeing fighters south-west of Grozny and killed 300 yesterday and on Sunday. The Chechen president, Aslan Maskhadov, conceded that his forces had sustained heavy casualties when retreating from Grozny last week. The sudden breakout from Grozny has brought the war back to many of the small towns and villages of western Chechnya, with roads closed yesterday to the capital from neighbouring Ingushetia because of air strikes and ground battles in the region. The area had been relatively quiet under Russian occupation for months, but many of the guerrilla fighters who had abandoned Grozny took shelter in its surrounding villages and forests. Events on the ground belied the both sides' propaganda claims; the return of the war to western Chechnya contradicted Russian assertions that Russian-occupied areas were under full Russian control and safe for civilian life, while the rebels' predicament also betrayed a sense of panic in their ranks. President Maskhadov tried to put a brave face on the losses, in what was one of the heaviest blows to his forces since the war started in September. He said a group of 2,000 forces had successfully escaped from Grozny and that a smaller group of several hundred had suffered casualties. But guerrilla morale appears to have been dealt a blow by the death of several key warlords and commanders during the past week. Russian television showed the number-one warlord, Shamil Basayev, having a foot amputated in a field hospital under local anaesthetic. The commander's face was pocked with shrapnel marks. The grim film appeared to have been released by the Chechens to counter rumours that Mr Basayev had been more heavily disabled. The Russian defence ministry said yesterday that 15 lorries transporting Chechen fighters into the southern mountains had been intercepted and destroyed near the village of Gekhi, south-west of Grozny.

There is no cleavage between rich and poor, north and south, country and city. \"The whole country is our core constituency,\" Tony Blair said at the weekend, anguish vying with anger in his reaction to the sincere disillusionment of his former loyalist, Peter Kilfoyle MP. Mr Blair insists that this is one nation, and he the leader of all the people.</p> <p>Unfortunately, this is completely untrue. England - never mind the Celts - is a country of several economic nations. The divisions between them are getting larger not smaller. There may not yet be significant political divisions, but the economic facts are scarcely disputable. Disposable household income is less than \u00a39,000 in the north, more than \u00a310,500 in the south-east. The number of people on less than 40% of national earnings rose by more than a million, to a record 8.4m, in Labour's first year. The rich have been getting richer, and the poor relatively much poorer, and they continue to do so. The mosaic of economic differences throughout Britain is startling, multi-faceted, and not remotely congruent with the presumption that this is a seamless single nation.</p> <p>When Mr Blair talks his one-nation rhetoric, therefore, he is describing aspiration not truth. It may be a commendable aspiration, but it is pursued by a tactic that offends Mr Kilfoyle and many people like him. For New Labour's purported liquidation of class politics involves appealing more to the upper than the lower half of the nation. This is what it thinks it has to do. It wants to prove itself not by declaring victory for Labour's own historic class but by appropriating its old class enemy, and clutching the middle class to the bosom once defined by politicians who had no doubt that they were socialists.</p> <p>In this it has been pretty successful in a remarkably short time. It has purloined the proprietorship of capitalism from the party of the right: so much so that only a hard-right neo-Thatcherite could make a case for saying that British business was unsafe in Labour's hands. It is also determined to remove patriotism from exclusive possession of the Conservative party, which is the upside case to be made for the caution with which it is handling the European issue.</p> <p>This combination of tendencies may even be responsible for the foul calumny uttered by J\u00f6rg Haider over the weekend, that he is partly following a Blairite line. \"Tony Blair has studied our programme and knows there are a lot of similarities,\" he lied. Although he has been flattered as a political master by virtually every continental politician, this is an endorsement Mr Blair could do without.</p> <p>None the less, Mr Kilfoyle catches him on a tender spot. The minister resigns to launch an Exocet at New Labour's proudest flank. He cannot tolerate this re-working of Labour into a prospective one-nation party, being done from the top downwards. A generalised discontent at the grass-roots is massing for the same reason. At the least there is bewilderment, at the most an increasingly alienated cynicism, which is likely to express itself by many people who voted Labour last time staying at home when they get the chance to vote again next year. That is by far the greatest electoral danger Mr Blair faces. In his heart he knows he has more to fear from the Kilfoyleite tendency, because it represents a genuine perception, than from the manoeuvrings of a mistrusted opportunist like Ken Livingstone.</p> <p>The strange thing is that the cynicism is exaggerated. It is far from fully justified. The Labour programme has been more redistributive than it looks. That means it has done things for the Labour heartland vote - its traditional class support - the merits of which the recipients do not fully credit. The national minimum wage has improved the lives of perhaps two million people. The working families tax credit and the new deal have done a lot for the have-nots of this divided society. Increased public spending on health and education represents a serious investment in the lives of those at the bottom end, as well as regions which depend on the public sector as the most important generator of economic activity.</p> <p>None of this is enough. Nothing ever is enough. A government that came in on the back of exceptionally high expectations was always going to displease those who wanted most from it. In my opinion it has been excessively risk-averse in its quest for fiscal prudence, and could have done more for more people whose quality of life remains heavily dependent on public money. It has hazarded, in particular, the support of its traditional constituency by talking a language that often sounds punitive, and is plainly directed at a different audience. It is not yet prepared to tackle the ideological centralism that has been the treasury-imposed consensus among governments of all colours for decades, which fathers the kind of alienation increasingly felt in Kilfoyle's Liverpool and many other parts of England beyond the M25.</p> <p>But the real record, if one takes any long view, is not bad. What is bad is more the perception. And what creates the perception, as much as anything, is the way in which Blairism chose to try to prove itself as a one-nation, all-embracing political movement which pretends the nation is not divided and insists that it, the great new party, can represent all of the people all of the time. To this end, it has consistently underplayed its interest in social justice. Only by diminishing, even excluding, its old constituency did it think it could make itself acceptable to a new one.</p> <p>Well, it has done the job. It no longer terrifies that part of the nation, the business part, which it was once proud to treat as the enemy. Given the state of the Conservative party, it is unlikely to lose its credibility with realistic business people for many years. It is led by politicians who are deeply believing capitalists, supported by a cohort of MPs who mostly belong to the same camp. So that part of the nation is at last secure.</p> <p>Yet the divisions remain, and they are indefensible. Far more needs to be done to bring the several economic nations somewhat closer together. Great differences will never be eliminated, nor should they be. That's the nature of a free economic society in a competitive world. But it's a matter of degree. The first precondition is to admit that alienation is grave and divisions do exist. The next is to address them with more sensitivity than was possible when the party was still concerned to establish its business credentials. Peter Kilfoyle, in other words, is an honest politician offering a wake-up call. It's our turn now, he says. For a leader as sensitive as Mr Blair to the political winds around him, this is one that requires more than defiant shouting.</p>",

      "body": "<p>I should have thought that Chris Woodhead's personal experience in those days long ago when he was an ordinary schoolteacher might have persuaded him to keep tactful silence on the subject of sex education. </p> <p>Asked at Exeter university last year what he thought of the government's plans to criminalise sexual relations between teacher and pupils, Woodhead replied that such relations could be \"experiential\". This reply so impressed his former wife Cathy that she broke her long silence about Woodhead's affair with his former pupil, Amanda Johnston. When the story of this affair broke some years ago - in the News of the World - Woodhead insisted that their affair did not start until Amanda left school. </p> <p>In March last year, after reading her former husband's historic reply at Exeter, Cathy Woodhead revealed - on the front page of the Mail on Sunday - that she found out about the affair several months before Amanda left school, when she was still being taught English by the future chief inspector. Mrs Woodhead's version was backed by a host of friends and former teachers at the school, and everyone who knew anything about it, except the secretary of state for education, David Blunkett, who replied to Cathy Woodhead's revelations by denouncing her for making them. </p> <p>Against this impressively honest and truthful background, up pops the chief inspector once again with his views on sex education: this time in an impromptu statement from his office. He has, he insists, come across no evidence to suggest that the controversial section 28 has a negative influence on homophobic bullying in schools. Whoops! As Lord Tope pointed out in the House of Lords last Thursday there is \"ample evidence\" of precisely that negative influence. Lord Whitty, for the government, agreed with him. \"Chris Woodhead does not seem to reflect the views of teachers,\" he said. \"Forty-four per cent of them felt that they had difficulty in meeting the needs of gay and lesbian pupils\" and 28% felt that section 28 \"may leave them open to legal proceedings\". </p> <p> Baroness Thornton then referred to a 1997 report of the Institute of Education, and added: \"I cannot believe that the chief inspector is not aware of this report and its comments.\" The truth is that Mr Woodhead is notoriously long on prejudice and short on fact. </p> <p>The point about section 28 is that it criminalises the promotion of gay sex but not heterosexual sex. So it discriminates. In normal circumstances the repeal of such an obviously discriminatory law might be greeted with profound relief. </p> <p>But circumstances are not normal. So ideologically weak has the government become that the forces of reaction, sensing another victory, have rallied behind this relic of discriminatory Tory junk. Almost every day, the Daily Mail waxes hysterical with homophobia, and in Scotland the great monopolist Brian Souter of Stagecoach, who made a fortune from Thatcher's bus privatisation, has put up half a million pounds to maintain in law one of the Thatcher government's most despicable prejudices. </p> <p>But wait. Who is this I hear on the radio teaming up with this reactionary gang? It is the bishop of Liverpool, who is introduced as \"Tony Blair's favourite bishop\". The bishop makes the sensitive point that our genitalia have been constructed so as to discourage homosexuality. I would like to have heard more from the bishop on the subject of genitalia, but he was cut off. His sophisticated argument - \"God made us this way, and that should be the end of the matter\" - reminded me of an old Flanders and Swann song about cannibalism, where the cannibal's refrain went like this: </p> <p> People have always eaten people. <br> What else is there to eat? <br> If the Jiu Jiu had meant us not to eat people, <br> He wouldn't have made us of meat. </p> <p>\u0095 It is surely high time the Tory party got to grips with their celebrated and long-standing member in Hyde - Dr Harold Shipman. What about expelling him for five years from the party? </p> <p>\u0095 Here's another in my occasional Great Leaps Forward series in which I cull facts from Hansard to demonstrate the enormous strides towards progress taken by the New Labour government - especially in those fields in which the traditionally more progressive ministers are in charge. In the House of Lords on February 11, that former leftwing firebrand, Lord Bassam of Brighton, was asked about prison suicides. He revealed that in 1997, the year New Labour came to office, 85 people killed themselves in prison. This figure went up to 96 in 1998 and 107 (just under two a week) in 1999. The main minister in charge of prisons is another former leftwing firebrand, Paul Boateng.</p>",

Against this impressively honest and truthful background, up pops the chief inspector once again with his views on sex education: this time in an impromptu statement from his office. He has, he insists, come across no evidence to suggest that the controversial section 28 has a negative influence on homophobic bullying in schools. Whoops! As Lord Tope pointed out in the House of Lords last Thursday there is \"ample evidence\" of precisely that negative influence. Lord Whitty, for the government, agreed with him. \"Chris Woodhead does not seem to reflect the views of teachers,\" he said. \"Forty-four per cent of them felt that they had difficulty in meeting the needs of gay and lesbian pupils\" and 28% felt that section 28 \"may leave them open to legal proceedings\". Baroness Thornton then referred to a 1997 report of the Institute of Education, and added: \"I cannot believe that the chief inspector is not aware of this report and its comments.\" The truth is that Mr Woodhead is notoriously long on prejudice and short on fact. The point about section 28 is that it criminalises the promotion of gay sex but not heterosexual sex. So it discriminates. In normal circumstances the repeal of such an obviously discriminatory law might be greeted with profound relief. But circumstances are not normal. So ideologically weak has the government become that the forces of reaction, sensing another victory, have rallied behind this relic of discriminatory Tory junk. Almost every day, the Daily Mail waxes hysterical with homophobia, and in Scotland the great monopolist Brian Souter of Stagecoach, who made a fortune from Thatcher's bus privatisation, has put up half a million pounds to maintain in law one of the Thatcher government's most despicable prejudices. But wait. Who is this I hear on the radio teaming up with this reactionary gang? It is the bishop of Liverpool, who is introduced as \"Tony Blair's favourite bishop\". The bishop makes the sensitive point that our genitalia have been constructed so as to discourage homosexuality. I would like to have heard more from the bishop on the subject of genitalia, but he was cut off. His sophisticated argument - \"God made us this way, and that should be the end of the matter\" - reminded me of an old Flanders and Swann song about cannibalism, where the cannibal's refrain went like this: People have always eaten people. What else is there to eat? If the Jiu Jiu had meant us not to eat people, He wouldn't have made us of meat. \u0095 It is surely high time the Tory party got to grips with their celebrated and long-standing member in Hyde - Dr Harold Shipman. What about expelling him for five years from the party? \u0095 Here's another in my occasional Great Leaps Forward series in which I cull facts from Hansard to demonstrate the enormous strides towards progress taken by the New Labour government - especially in those fields in which the traditionally more progressive ministers are in charge. In the House of Lords on February 11, that former leftwing firebrand, Lord Bassam of Brighton, was asked about prison suicides. He revealed that in 1997, the year New Labour came to office, 85 people killed themselves in prison. This figure went up to 96 in 1998 and 107 (just under two a week) in 1999. The main minister in charge of prisons is another former leftwing firebrand, Paul Boateng.",

As protest groups demonstrated in Parliament Square Lady Young - former Tory leader of the Lords and chief supporter of retaining the controversial section 28 of the local government bill - argued that there was no \"moral equivalence\" between gay and heterosexual relationships. Later in the debate Labour's Lord Alli strongly endorsed abolition of the clause, accusing its supporters of having the same \"morality of hate\" as the bomber who blew up a gay pub in Soho, London. Earlier the Bishop of Blackburn, the Rt Rev Alan Chesters, withdrew a proposed amendment to promote marriage in schools after assurances from junior environment minister Lord Whitty that the government would debate the issues with the church before the bill's report stage. The former Conservative minister, Lord St John of Fawsley, criticised the stand taken against homosexuality by Scottish Catholics' leader Cardinal Thomas Winning. \"Cardinal Winning has spoken out in an unapettising way, which I as a Catholic do not agree with.\" Lady Young claimed she knew section 28 \"has been effective in stopping local authorities from promoting homosexuality in schools.

      "bodyText": "All the evidence shows that in the case of new and innovative products and services, consumers behave anything but rationally. The dome (Dome to get Disney touch, February 7) is something new: neither a theme park nor a trade show, it is both fun and educational, it celebrates both the past and the future. Consumers have no reference points when trying to evaluate it, and for the vast majority of us no amount of advertising and public relations is likely to be effective. A minority of consumers (usually between 2% and 5%) will buy into almost anything that is new, invariably doing so as soon as it is launched. It is these \"innovators\" who would have been trooping through the turnstiles in the early weeks. With any sort of innovation, though, the rest of us are sceptical: perhaps 15% to 20% will never adopt the product, but the cautious majority will hold back. The principal persuasive element - as we tend to block out the 1,400 or so commercial messages we are subjected to each day - is personal recommendation. This is where the \"innovators\" make their mark: even as management heads roll at Greenwich, there are likely to be around 280,000 enthusiasts telling family, friends and colleagues of their \"one amazing day\". Experience suggests that visitor numbers will continue to decline marginally in February, before recovering to January's levels in early spring. By May or June the dome is likely to have achieved break-even, with momentum building throughout the summer. By the end of the year we can expect a further surge caused by the dome's forthcoming scarcity value. Robin Croft Business School, University of Glamorgan rcroft@glam.ac.uk \u0095 The idea that public money is being used to promote commercial interests is quite disturbing, but until Saturday I had not realised that this is the Millennium Dome's main purpose. One of the main culprits was the Manpower-sponsored Work zone, which used an installation piece of hamster cages and Post-it notes to represent the transition from the oppressive dark-ages of the nine-to-five job for life, to the new post-Fordist model of a flexible labour market, where people don't have a career so much as a portfolio of work experiences. This exhibit gave no thought whatsoever to alternative models of work and production (eg co-ops, LETS) and merely peddled the same rhetoric about the need for people to gain transferable skills in order to fit into the new hi-tech economy (of call centres and data entry, no doubt). Paul Kent London P.A.Kent@qmw.ac.uk \u0095 Why does Mr Blair blame Jennie Page and others for the fact that millions of people, possibly the majority of us, decided the very concept of the dome was a sheer waste of public money and are not prepared to waste more of our hard-earned cash on expensive entry tickets and fiendishly expensive travel just to see a lot of gimmicky exhibits?

After all, the pressure on the provos has surely never been greater. Yesterday saw John Hume, the Nobel laureate and leader of the nationalist SDLP, add his own statesmanlike weight to the chorus demanding IRA guns. He said \"a gesture\" from the provos might break the current impasse.</p> <p>The Unionists would not walk out of the process; Peter Mandelson would not have to suspend the newly-established executive. A simple act of disarmament would get everything back on track. As if to underline the need for decommissioning, Sunday night saw a reminder of the bad old days: a bomb at Mahon's hotel in the Fermanagh town of Irvinestown, put there by the rejectionists of the Continuity IRA. In this kind of atmosphere, how can the IRA possibly keep hold of its arms?</p> <p>A clue can be found in the rubble of that hotel. For far from showing why the guns have to be handed over right now, Sunday night's attack shows why even those republicans who consider themselves pro-peace are wary of decommissioning. They fear that such a move will split the IRA: hardliners will regard the handover, timed to satisfy Unionist and British demands, as a surrender, and they will bolt. Some may go to the Continuity IRA, others to the Real IRA - the group behind Northern Ireland's worst-ever atrocity, the 1998 bombing of Omagh. In other words, Sunday's explosion serves as a reminder of what can happen if decommissioning is handled wrongly: if weaponry is forced out of the hands of the IRA before that organisation is sufficiently unified to take that step together. One republican raised an other alarming thought at the weekend: how would the moderate wing of the IRA, once it had given up its guns, \"persuade\" the rejectionist rebels, who were still armed, to come on side? It would hardly be a balanced debate. Put simply, an IRA split is a danger for all who fear a return to violence and bloodshed.</p> <p>What is needed instead is a context in which republicans can move on arms together.

      "bodyText": "If not now, when? If the IRA will not disarm now, when - if ever - will it? That's the question Northern Ireland's increasingly exasperated people must be asking themselves. After all, the pressure on the provos has surely never been greater. Yesterday saw John Hume, the Nobel laureate and leader of the nationalist SDLP, add his own statesmanlike weight to the chorus demanding IRA guns. He said \"a gesture\" from the provos might break the current impasse. The Unionists would not walk out of the process; Peter Mandelson would not have to suspend the newly-established executive. A simple act of disarmament would get everything back on track. As if to underline the need for decommissioning, Sunday night saw a reminder of the bad old days: a bomb at Mahon's hotel in the Fermanagh town of Irvinestown, put there by the rejectionists of the Continuity IRA. In this kind of atmosphere, how can the IRA possibly keep hold of its arms? A clue can be found in the rubble of that hotel. For far from showing why the guns have to be handed over right now, Sunday night's attack shows why even those republicans who consider themselves pro-peace are wary of decommissioning. They fear that such a move will split the IRA: hardliners will regard the handover, timed to satisfy Unionist and British demands, as a surrender, and they will bolt. Some may go to the Continuity IRA, others to the Real IRA - the group behind Northern Ireland's worst-ever atrocity, the 1998 bombing of Omagh. In other words, Sunday's explosion serves as a reminder of what can happen if decommissioning is handled wrongly: if weaponry is forced out of the hands of the IRA before that organisation is sufficiently unified to take that step together. One republican raised an other alarming thought at the weekend: how would the moderate wing of the IRA, once it had given up its guns, \"persuade\" the rejectionist rebels, who were still armed, to come on side? It would hardly be a balanced debate. Put simply, an IRA split is a danger for all who fear a return to violence and bloodshed. What is needed instead is a context in which republicans can move on arms together. That is not as remote a prospect as it may sound. Indeed it was clearly signalled in the IRA's weekend statement, which agreed that disarmament was a \"necessary objective.\" The way to do that is to remove the symbolic edge - of surrender - and replace it with one of equivalence. If IRA decommissioning can be presented as part of an overall programme of demilitarisation, then it will soon lose its sting. \"Only defeated armies hand in their weapons,\" say the republicans, insisting that since they were never defeated they will not act as if they were.

Something of an understatement really. Last year, Sarah was a high-flying account executive with Gartmore, an investment bank in the City of London. When she eventually qualifies as a teacher, she will earn a fraction of the salary she commanded at Gartmore and during her training she's not earning anything at all. </p> <p>Sarah joined Gartmore on leaving Exeter University.

Step forward the heroic Hodge Hill in Birmingham, a 1,300-strong, multicultural, inner-city comprehensive. Trevor Edinborough, the gently spoken headteacher, seems a little twitchy. He takes us into a cell-like room to explain the terms. By all means talk about sex education, he says, but please don't mention the section. \"We could upset a lot of parents.\" I can't help thinking of Fawlty Towers. </p> <p>I tell him I'm more interested in finding out what sex education actually involves these days, and how important pupils feel it is. He looks relieved. \"For us this is a central part of the curriculum and it will grow. It's very much at the heart of the work we do with young children.\" </p> <p>Sex education is optional in primary and junior schools and compulsory in secondaries. But it is a long way from being a structured part of the national curriculum. Schools have to do something, anything, and it is up to their board of governors to decide what exactly. Trevor Edinborough says he would like to see the government provide a proper framework for schools to build their courses round. John Bennett, the health education, citizenship and community education director for Birmingham local education authority, believes this will only happen once section 28 is scrapped. </p> <p>Bennett says that in some areas of sex education, progress has been made. \"When we did it at secondary school, it was straight biology. Now you do a lot of the basic biology in primary school.\" He tells me about a television series he made in which 5- to 7-year-olds were introduced to the correct names for body parts used in reproduction, the 7- to 9-year-olds watched a live birth, and the 9- to 11-year-olds were discussing the intricacies of relationships. </p> <p>He's right. It is a far cry from my school days in the mid-seventies. We were given a biology teacher who drew a couple of organs on the blackboard and then retired with post-traumatic stress. The hardest kid in the year fainted when we were shown a film of childbirth. We were 14 at the time. A few months later, he got a classmate pregnant. When the girls were away from school for a few days, we didn't ask questions. </p> <p>Jane Bonner is Hodge Hill's personal health and social education teacher. In the old days we would have called her a sex education teacher, but she patiently explains that her specialism involves rather more than sex. She introduces me to a group of 10 14- to 15-year-old pupils working together on a project based on the novel Junk, in which two 14-year-olds run away together, end up in a squat and are forced to confront drugs, violence, sex and the whole shebang. </p> <p>Although the group is mixed, they have segregated themselves into boys at one end of the table, girls at the other. One by one, they explain why sex education is important. </p> <p>Derek Evans says: \"It's about how to be in a relationship. The pressures of growing up - you know, like periods for girls and puberty and peer pressure.\" </p> <p>Susan Lenihan is typical of the girls - she talks in a quiet, considered way. \"It's about much more than sex. It prepares you for life, the problems with relationships, and what you can get out of them.\" The group are relaxed with the word \"relationship\". A word we would have dismissed as poofy at school in the seventies. Intermingled with \"relationship\" are \"contraceptive\", \"unwanted pregnancy\", \"responsibilities\". </p> <p> Noel Smithen is ladsy and funny with a touch of the Ali Gs. He talks a lot, makes his mates giggle, and veers between the sensible and ridiculous. \"There never used to be so many teenage pregnancies, because people didn't know much about it, because people weren't taught about it.\" The group tend to say \"it\" rather than \"sex\". </p> <p>\"No, that's not true,\" the rest of the group chorus. \"Just because we know about it, doesn't make us more likely to do it.\" </p> <p>But Noel is on a roll. \"After a lesson listening to sex this and sex that, and you go home and you're with your girlfriend you probably want to try it out don't you?\" The group erupts into laughter. </p> <p>Derek Evans seems a more representative voice. \"If you didn't have the knowledge, then you'd be out of school doing what you can, getting girls under 16 pregnant and you'd have the police involved, you'd never be able to grow up properly because you'd have a child, you'd never be able to go out and enjoy yourself. Some parents wouldn't accept it and they'd put you out on the street.\" The group nod at the devastating scenario. </p> <p>Afterwards, John Bennett tells me there are many important myths to dispel. He says it's certainly not true, as Noel suggests, that there are more teenage pregnancies these days, but the figures are not as encouraging as they could be. </p> <p>\"In the 1970s, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands had about the same rate of teenage pregnancies - around 70 per thousand. We've reduced our rate to about 53 per thousand, while the Dutch have reduced theirs to about eight or nine per thousand.\" </p> <p>How did they manage it? He talks about a multi-agency approach involving the Catholic and Dutch Reform churches, the government, the education authorities, and how sex education was made more explicit and access to services was improved. Most telling is the fact that while the average age of first intercourse continues to decline by a year a decade in Britain (currently between 16 and 17), the Netherlands has steadied itself round the 18 mark. </p> <p>I ask the pupils whether they would prefer to be taught as a single-sex group. All but one say yes. \"Some girls don't feel comfortable with boys around them, and boys can be immature,\" says Iyesha Williams. </p> <p>The teacher, Jane Bonner, interrupts to say they will be doing some single-sex work in the future where it will be easier to look at more controversial topics in depth. She talks about the areas they cover in the Child Development GCSE - abortion, IVF etc. \"In social education we don't have the time, or rather we don't make the time, to look at one subject in detail.\" </p> <p>Ashley Francis is one of the few boys taking the GCSE. \"In Child Development we learn about every aspect, whereas in Social Education some aspects are left out because of the feelings of other people.\" Ashley is a sensitive, clued-up boy. He says one of the good things about sex education is \"You don't just talk about your feelings about relationships, but how other people feel as well - what your girlfriend may be scared about as well as what you may be scared about.\" </p> <p>The group is open, mature and easy with each other. So open that David Bromley admits: \"I didn't know much about all this before we started.\" </p> <p>We move on to homosexuality, and the debate becomes more heated. None of the children feels they shouldn't be taught about homosexuality, but Noel sums up the feeling when he says: \"I don't think it should be discussed that much because it's a minority.\" They argue that attitudes have changed over the years - because of programmes like Jerry Springer, we are more tolerant of difference. </p> <p>A recent survey by the lesbian and gay pressure group Stonewall revealed that 64% of women thought section 28 should be repealed, while only 43% of men did. And it is when the school group discuss homosexuality that there is the most noticeable difference in gender attitudes. The girls are far more tolerant, though even most of them think homosexuality is \"unnatural\". </p> <p>Iyesha says: \"It's important to talk about gay sex to tell people about the dangers.\" None of the group appears to be aware that in Britain last year more people contracted Aids through straight sex than gay sex. </p> <p>The longer we talk about the gay issue, the more the prejudices emerge. The same prejudices we hear in the adult world, on telly, in the newspapers. Derek has strong views. He delivers them perfectly reasonably, without a hint of the ferocity that so often accompanies bigotry. \"I think it's sick, to be honest. Man and woman were brought together by God for man and woman, not just for two men or two women. There was something on the news about two gay men adopting a child, and then you get people at school saying 'who's your mum?', and the kid says 'it's Bill'.\" Everyone agrees that it is unfair for gay men to adopt, that the child would be ridiculed at school. It's hard to disagree with them - no one knows better about bullying at school than schoolkids. </p> <p>Trevor Edinborough didn't want us to talk about section 28, the political issue. But he knew as well as I did that if we were talking about sexuality, we would also end up talking about homosexuality, the human issue. Not promoting, not proselytsing, but talking. As most teachers do at some point most weeks. </p> <p>If anything, the pupils' conversation shows what a a sham the whole section 28 debate really is. Promote homosexuality? Pervert a bunch of schoolkids? Who are they kidding? The best any realistic teacher could hope is to damp down the prejudices of the majority. </p> <p>Meanwhile, there's no stopping Derek. \"I don't know how anybody could do it, actually. I don't know how anybody could be attracted to the same sex. I think they should all be shot or something.\" The girls tut. \"It's up to other people to do what they do,\" says Susan. </p> <p>I ask again whether they think we are more open about homosexuality these days. Yes, definitely, they answer. Does that mean it would be easier to admit you are gay in school than years ago? No, says Noel with surprising softness. \"You can discuss it now, but if you come out and say you're this or that, you might as well just leave the school.\"</p>",

It would be an exercise of amazingly principled restraint by NUT members to forswear big pay increases being seized by their colleagues from other unions. </p> <p>The first stage of the government's plan involves the creation of a higher salary band for teachers on the current classroom maximum of \u00a323,193 (rising to \u00a323,958 from April as a result of the annual settlement announced last week). </p> <p>To reach this higher salary scale, they will have to pass a \"threshold\" assessment to prove their professionalism. There are about 220,000 teachers in England at the current maximum and David Blunkett, the education and employment secretary, has said he expects a majority to pass the test - although not necessarily in the first year. </p> <p>Those who reach the higher scale will be able to progress eventually to a maximum of \u00a330,000 a year without having to take on management responsibilities. </p> <p>So far, so good. But the scheme will be discredited if procedures are not put in place to make sure that the right teachers pass the threshold. If too many wrong decisions are made and grievance builds up among staff, Blunkett risks an exodus. </p> <p>The assessment procedure has been taking shape over the last few days as confidential drafts were discussed with the teacher unions. The latest version seen by the Guardian showed eight standards that teachers will be required to meet, covering \"professional characteristics, knowledge and understanding, teaching and assessment, pupil outcomes and wider professional effectiveness.\" Heads will be expected to refuse the performance uplift if a teacher fails to pass under every heading. Decisions will be monitored by spot checks from a team of government assessors. </p> <p>Some of the criteria look quite vague: for example, teachers will be expected to show they are \"effective professionals who challenge and support all pupils to do their best\". </p> <p>Others are more hard-edged. The most controversial will be the requirement that pupils \"attain good marks or grades in any relevant national tests or examinations, or school based assessment... relative to pupils' prior attainment and in the context of national levels of achievement.\" Individual teachers will be knocked back if their pupils do not progress as fast as the average for their type of school. </p> <p>Although they will be allowed to plead special circumstances, such as high pupil turnover or absence during tests, it is strange that a teacher should be judged against results to be expected from the school as a whole, rather than the standard that could reasonably be expected from the relevant class. </p> <p>Ministers cannot delay the scheme because the Treasury has already offered \u00a31bn over the next two years and there is a political imperative to have something in place by the next election. </p> <p>But they cannot be sure how heads will judge their staff. Some may be keen to reward as many as the assessors permit. Others may be fearful of the impact on school budgets two years down the line when the government stops funding the scheme from the centre. How can ministers be sure there is fairness across the country, with the desired proportion of teachers reaching the higher grade? Will a day's training for every head be enough to gear up the system? </p> <p>The juggernaut is rolling. But there was menace in the warning last week from the School Teachers' Review Body. \"We have concerns about the pressures of the introductory phase,\" it said. \"The extent of the training necessary should not be underestimated.

Decisions will be monitored by spot checks from a team of government assessors. Some of the criteria look quite vague: for example, teachers will be expected to show they are \"effective professionals who challenge and support all pupils to do their best\". Others are more hard-edged. The most controversial will be the requirement that pupils \"attain good marks or grades in any relevant national tests or examinations, or school based assessment... relative to pupils' prior attainment and in the context of national levels of achievement.\" Individual teachers will be knocked back if their pupils do not progress as fast as the average for their type of school. Although they will be allowed to plead special circumstances, such as high pupil turnover or absence during tests, it is strange that a teacher should be judged against results to be expected from the school as a whole, rather than the standard that could reasonably be expected from the relevant class. Ministers cannot delay the scheme because the Treasury has already offered \u00a31bn over the next two years and there is a political imperative to have something in place by the next election. But they cannot be sure how heads will judge their staff. Some may be keen to reward as many as the assessors permit. Others may be fearful of the impact on school budgets two years down the line when the government stops funding the scheme from the centre. How can ministers be sure there is fairness across the country, with the desired proportion of teachers reaching the higher grade? Will a day's training for every head be enough to gear up the system? The juggernaut is rolling. But there was menace in the warning last week from the School Teachers' Review Body. \"We have concerns about the pressures of the introductory phase,\" it said. \"The extent of the training necessary should not be underestimated. In all this we are conscious of how much the handling of the initial phase will determine the longer-term success of the new arrangements.\" The timetable February: government consultation paper on how teachers can cross the pay threshold March/April: scheme finalised and application forms sent to schools June 5: deadline for teachers to submit applications July 31: deadline for heads to send decisions to consultants handling the scheme September 1: first teachers get \u00a32,000 uplift Autumn term: assessors continue vetting heads' decisions: extra pay for successful applicants backdated to September 1.",

      "body": "<p>A \u00a35m campaign to make Tony Blair's concept of a modern-minded, more pro-Europe \"Cool Britannia\" attractive to overseas students is all very well, but it will take more than a marketing makeover to make it happen. </p> <p>The keys to a positive attitude to mainland Europe and to its students lie in openness and exposure to the cultures, people and institutions of other European countries. All these are mediated through language, theirs as well as our own. For this reason the European Union has repeatedly stressed the importance of language learning, both in achieving socio-political objectives such as mutual understanding, respect for pluralism and the development of European citizenship, and in achieving economic aims such as the mobility of capital and labour in a multilingual, multicultural, economic area. </p> <p>But while language learning is thriving in most parts of mainland Europe, in Britain the market share of \"specialist\" language learning at A-level and beyond is in decline, with French being particularly hard hit. </p> <p>The problem is visible in our schools. The increase in the number of candidates taking GCSE in a modern foreign language is not being accompanied by a corresponding all-round increase in the number taking a language at A level. </p> <p>So what is putting them off? Perhaps the lack of congruence between GCSE and A level in terms of syllabus and methodology has made the transition from GCSE to A level a daunting one for many students. </p> <p>Perhaps the national curriculum has left less space for students to study two foreign languages than was previously so and thereby undermined early specialisation in languages - a 1997 Teacher Training Agency report certainly identified the dwindling number of dual linguists at GCSE and A level as one of the causes of the shortage in teacher supply. </p> <p>Perhaps young people are now finding their role models and preferred life styles elsewhere in the English-speaking world, and not aspiring to live in countries where English is not the mother tongue. </p> <p>Or perhaps the view that the rest of the world speaks English is now being consolidated by the belief that emerging language technologies will soon be able to sort out translation problems in the odd corners of the globe where it is not spoken. </p> <p>Whatever the causes, the introduction, from next year, of \"golden hellos\" to entice languages graduates into teaching is a very public admission of just how bad things have become. </p> <p>The fact that around a third of our modern foreign language teacher trainees are not from the UK further shows how much we are having, in effect, to outsource a significant proportion of our national teacher supply. </p> <p>The Higher Education Funding Council for England has recognised that languages are expensive to teach and has made more money available through an upward revision of their price band (though not yet for French). Yet the council's recent suggestion that universities should consider \"rationalising\" language departments collaboratively and on a regional basis has not been thought through and may well lead to further decline. </p> <p>Language associations believe the funding council has failed to recognise the enormous growth in \"non-specialist\" language learning over the last decade and therefore badly underestimates the total volume of language learning in universities. These students are not \"visible\" in the statistical returns made by universities to the council. </p> <p>As Hilary Footitt suggested in last week's Guardian Higher, what we actually need is a collective, long-term perspective which recognises the need to stimulate demand rather than cut supply if a bad situation is not to become an irretrievable one. </p> <p>Closing down, selectively pruning or otherwise \"rationalising\" languages departments will not help \"Cool Britannia\" one iota, and existing funding arrangements may need further modification to support modern foreign languages through this difficult period. </p> <p>There needs to be the kind of joined-up thinking which can only be provided by a national policy on modern languages encompassing the various branches of compulsory and post-compulsory education. </p> <p>Perhaps the forthcoming final report of the Nuffield inquiry will help bring us one step closer to realising that objective. </p> <p>Meanwhile, we need to take every opportunity to challenge the myth that monolingualism is somehow \"cool\". </p> <p>\"Cool, mon cul,\" as French pop star, Zazie, might have said.</p> <p>\u0095 Derrik Ferney is head of languages and intercultural studies at Anglia Polytechnic University and chairs the standing conference of heads of modern languages in universities.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A \u00a35m campaign to make Tony Blair's concept of a modern-minded, more pro-Europe \"Cool Britannia\" attractive to overseas students is all very well, but it will take more than a marketing makeover to make it happen. The keys to a positive attitude to mainland Europe and to its students lie in openness and exposure to the cultures, people and institutions of other European countries. All these are mediated through language, theirs as well as our own. For this reason the European Union has repeatedly stressed the importance of language learning, both in achieving socio-political objectives such as mutual understanding, respect for pluralism and the development of European citizenship, and in achieving economic aims such as the mobility of capital and labour in a multilingual, multicultural, economic area. But while language learning is thriving in most parts of mainland Europe, in Britain the market share of \"specialist\" language learning at A-level and beyond is in decline, with French being particularly hard hit. The problem is visible in our schools. The increase in the number of candidates taking GCSE in a modern foreign language is not being accompanied by a corresponding all-round increase in the number taking a language at A level. So what is putting them off? Perhaps the lack of congruence between GCSE and A level in terms of syllabus and methodology has made the transition from GCSE to A level a daunting one for many students. Perhaps the national curriculum has left less space for students to study two foreign languages than was previously so and thereby undermined early specialisation in languages - a 1997 Teacher Training Agency report certainly identified the dwindling number of dual linguists at GCSE and A level as one of the causes of the shortage in teacher supply. Perhaps young people are now finding their role models and preferred life styles elsewhere in the English-speaking world, and not aspiring to live in countries where English is not the mother tongue. Or perhaps the view that the rest of the world speaks English is now being consolidated by the belief that emerging language technologies will soon be able to sort out translation problems in the odd corners of the globe where it is not spoken. Whatever the causes, the introduction, from next year, of \"golden hellos\" to entice languages graduates into teaching is a very public admission of just how bad things have become. The fact that around a third of our modern foreign language teacher trainees are not from the UK further shows how much we are having, in effect, to outsource a significant proportion of our national teacher supply. The Higher Education Funding Council for England has recognised that languages are expensive to teach and has made more money available through an upward revision of their price band (though not yet for French). Yet the council's recent suggestion that universities should consider \"rationalising\" language departments collaboratively and on a regional basis has not been thought through and may well lead to further decline. Language associations believe the funding council has failed to recognise the enormous growth in \"non-specialist\" language learning over the last decade and therefore badly underestimates the total volume of language learning in universities. These students are not \"visible\" in the statistical returns made by universities to the council. As Hilary Footitt suggested in last week's Guardian Higher, what we actually need is a collective, long-term perspective which recognises the need to stimulate demand rather than cut supply if a bad situation is not to become an irretrievable one. Closing down, selectively pruning or otherwise \"rationalising\" languages departments will not help \"Cool Britannia\" one iota, and existing funding arrangements may need further modification to support modern foreign languages through this difficult period. There needs to be the kind of joined-up thinking which can only be provided by a national policy on modern languages encompassing the various branches of compulsory and post-compulsory education. Perhaps the forthcoming final report of the Nuffield inquiry will help bring us one step closer to realising that objective. Meanwhile, we need to take every opportunity to challenge the myth that monolingualism is somehow \"cool\". \"Cool, mon cul,\" as French pop star, Zazie, might have said. \u0095 Derrik Ferney is head of languages and intercultural studies at Anglia Polytechnic University and chairs the standing conference of heads of modern languages in universities.",

Designers, for instance, need to be very patient and have an eye for detail.

If the designer is directly involved in manufacture, nimble fingers are required. </p> <p><strong> Doesn't the mass-produced stuff need designers as well?</strong> Sure.

Designers can also spend a lot of time researching materials, production processes and trends. </p> <p><strong> Where do designers work?</strong> They may operate on their own, or join forces to form small businesses and workshops. Independent designers and craft workers tend to create exclusive hand-crafted pieces, which are commissioned by an individual. They need to have effective business skills in order to produce competitively priced and marketed jewellery. </p> <p><strong> Are their other specialities? </strong> Yes, of course. People specialise in mounting, setting or polishing jewellery. These all require training and are separate crafts within fine jewellery making. Then there are gemmologists who are concerned solely with gemstone manipulation. </p> <p><strong> And what about the retail side? </strong> Retailers are often concerned with both the sale and the repair of jewellery. They can be part of a national chain that has its own mass-produced supply, or an individual specialist shop. </p> <p><strong> What's needed?</strong> For the solo operations, determination and enthusiasm. In general, a good eye for quality is a must, plus a sound business sense, and as in all retail, the ability to provide good customer service. </p> <p><strong> And what about qualifications and training? </strong> Academic achievement is not essential, although art or CDT experience is beneficial, as are attention to detail and a willingness to learn. There are several routes into jewellery making. </p> <p>In factories and workshops, training is often on site, under the guidance of an experienced craftsperson. There is a modern apprenticeship scheme for 16- to 24-year-olds. Employees may be released for college courses, or may get their work assessed at their place of employment for a vocational qualification. </p> <p><strong> What could they get?</strong> There are numerous qualifications, such as NVQ levels 1 and 2 in manufacture of jewellery and related products, and NVQ 3 in manufacture ofspecialised jewellery and related products. City &amp; Guilds have a manufacturing jewellery and allied products qualification and the Open College Network does jewellery and art metal work. </p> <p><strong> That's jolly int...</strong> Don't interrupt.

City &amp; Guilds have a manufacturing jewellery and allied products qualification and the Open College Network does jewellery and art metal work. That's jolly int... Don't interrupt. There are also degree courses which usually require completion of a foundation course at a college of art and design. So you can these days become a BA in metalwork and jewellery, or in three-dimensional design, or design and applied arts.

      "body": "<p>Another cable channel was launched in the US this month. Oxygen has been advertised as the first integrated internet and television network by and for women, and is the brainchild of Oprah Winfrey and the Hollywood team which created the sitcoms Roseanne and Murphy Brown. The day begins with Inhale, a yoga show, followed by a live, studio \"chat-session\". Ka-Ching is a lunchtime money-management programme, followed by a \"girl-power\" slot. Actress Candice Bergen (who plays journalist Murphy Brown) interviews celebrities on Exhale, to end the day. The producers don't seem to think women need or want a news or public affairs programme.</p> <p>Is Oxygen the face of 21st-century feminism, proof positive that all that work for women's liberation has evaporated into an ozone of self-help and SheCommerce? (another Oxygen show.) Perhaps. But it's more likely that the corporations which back the network - Microsoft, America OnLine and Mo\u00ebt-Hennessy Louis Vuitton - prefer to sponsor programmes about our bodies and bank balances, than investigate the sweatshop side of the fashion business, say, or the high rate of blindness among women who put microchips on motherboards.</p> <p>Conservatives love to blame feminists for the fact that a movement for equal pay and self-determination seems to have morphed into a support group for the upwardly mobile, but the operative word is \"seems\". The personal is still political. It's just that the political is, well, political, after all. The same folks who criticise feminists for overemphasising the personal, spent much of the 90s trying to topple a president over a blow job.</p> <p>At the opposite end of the power-pile, no lives are more politicised than those of poor women. With the eradication of federal standards when it comes to dispensing welfare benefits, many states penalise women who deviate from prescribed behaviours by docking all or some of their benefits. A woman's benefits may be cut in 21 states if she balks at naming her child's father or misses a health visit in eight states, or fails to seek birth control in five states.</p> <p>After years of struggle for legal abortion and to end involuntary sterilisation, \"welfare reform\" is a huge leap away from freedom of choice.

      "bodyText": "Another cable channel was launched in the US this month. Oxygen has been advertised as the first integrated internet and television network by and for women, and is the brainchild of Oprah Winfrey and the Hollywood team which created the sitcoms Roseanne and Murphy Brown. The day begins with Inhale, a yoga show, followed by a live, studio \"chat-session\". Ka-Ching is a lunchtime money-management programme, followed by a \"girl-power\" slot. Actress Candice Bergen (who plays journalist Murphy Brown) interviews celebrities on Exhale, to end the day. The producers don't seem to think women need or want a news or public affairs programme. Is Oxygen the face of 21st-century feminism, proof positive that all that work for women's liberation has evaporated into an ozone of self-help and SheCommerce? (another Oxygen show.) Perhaps. But it's more likely that the corporations which back the network - Microsoft, America OnLine and Mo\u00ebt-Hennessy Louis Vuitton - prefer to sponsor programmes about our bodies and bank balances, than investigate the sweatshop side of the fashion business, say, or the high rate of blindness among women who put microchips on motherboards. Conservatives love to blame feminists for the fact that a movement for equal pay and self-determination seems to have morphed into a support group for the upwardly mobile, but the operative word is \"seems\". The personal is still political. It's just that the political is, well, political, after all. The same folks who criticise feminists for overemphasising the personal, spent much of the 90s trying to topple a president over a blow job. At the opposite end of the power-pile, no lives are more politicised than those of poor women. With the eradication of federal standards when it comes to dispensing welfare benefits, many states penalise women who deviate from prescribed behaviours by docking all or some of their benefits. A woman's benefits may be cut in 21 states if she balks at naming her child's father or misses a health visit in eight states, or fails to seek birth control in five states. After years of struggle for legal abortion and to end involuntary sterilisation, \"welfare reform\" is a huge leap away from freedom of choice. But those feminists, in groups like Wisconsin's Welfare Warriors, and the Kensington Welfare Rights Union in Philadelphia, are unlikely to bask in the spotlight of Oxygen. It's been three years since the passage of the welfare law, and they have yet to get any sort of national attention on Microsoft (MSNBC), Disney (ABC), or Time Warner/Turner (CNN) TV. Women are in the public debate these days, and I'm not just talking about Oprah and co. The sex is no longer banished, but some political perspectives get short shrift. At last count there were two nationally syndicated, women columnists who proudly identify as feminists, yet the roster of conservative women with national newspaper columns and television slots expands: Jeanne Kirkpatrick, Mona Charen, Linda Chavez, Cathy Young. All these are syndicated columnists who hold office in the Women's Freedom Network, a libertarian outfit with ties to the Catholic Right, or the Independent Women's Forum, a 90s platform for anti-feminist pundits of the Washington-insider set. These groups field influential teams to praise welfare reform, damn affirmative action, and among other things, oppose the Violence Against Women Act (which opens federal courts to women when they have no confidence in their state.)

But in a garden shed in north London Ken Campbell has been recreating for television the six scientific experiments that changed the world. Mr Campbell is best known as an eccentric actor and theatre director, several of whose performances have lasted for 24 hours, but he also has a passion for science. He is presenting a series, starting next weekend on Channel 4, which looks at the geniuses who established principles which are now accepted without question - such as Isaac Newton's proof, in 1670, that light perceived as white is made up of the spectrum of colours, and Marie Curie's discovery of radium, which led to the beginning of nuclear physics. Mr Campbell's experiments have now moved on to the transmission of sound, an interest he shares with two of his subjects, Newton and Michael Faraday - although they would perhaps not have attempted to make water in a potty vibrate by throwing the voice, something which ventriloquists have told him is impossible. Although the mathematics involved in the series were far beyond Mr Campbell, the equipment used was often so simple that it could be recreated in a garden shed. The programmes combine the shed experiments with interviews with scientists and science historians, and film made in the original settings of the experiments, including the cathedral in Pisa and a monastery garden near Prague. The experiments selected were: Newton's work on light in 1669 and 1670, which he called \"the crucial experiment\"; British astronomer Arthur Eddington's photographs of the 1919 total solar eclipse, which helped prove Einstein's general theory of relativity, which stated that the gravitational pull of planets and stars was accompanied by a perceived bending of light as it passed them; Faraday's doughnut, a home-made apparatus of an insulated iron ring, connected on one side to a battery and on the other to a meter, by which he demonstrated that the current passing through an electro magnet could move the needle without any direct physical contact; Marie Curie's years of dangerous work to isolate, in 1910, the unknown element radium from tons of the compound pitchblende, which may eventually have caused her death from leukaemia; Gregor Mendel's study of 30,000 pea plants grown in his monastery garden in the 1850s, which established the principles of genetic inheritance; Galileo Galilei's work, which proved that Aristotle was wrong, and that heavy objects do not fall faster than light ones.

      "bodyText": "The future of Scotland's four national arts companies and its arts council has been questioned in a report on its cultural identity. The document, on the results of a consultation on the Scottish executive's planned national cultural strategy, not only found that people were fed up with funding crises afflicting the companies, but also questioned whether they should even be called national, because they neither reflected the Scottish nation nor performed nationally. Most of the 1,000 people consulted called for a funding review of Scottish Opera, Scottish Ballet, the Royal Scottish National Orchestra and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra. They thought the Scottish arts council should become more of an enabler and supporter rather than a powerful organisation with its own agenda, or should be abolished. Last week a report by the Scottish executive on Scottish Opera said the company was brought to within 24 hours of closure by arrogant and irresponsible management. The consultation document was based on written responses and public meetings held over seven months. Yesterday Rhona Brankin, deputy minister for culture and sport, said the exercise had identified a number of key themes for the executive to look at more closely. The report found concern that Scotland's cultural image had too much emphasis on tartan and shortbread. - Kirsty Scott",

Budejovicky Budvaris is the successor of a brewing firm established there in 1895 while Anheuser-Busch Inc set up business in Missouri in the 19th century and began calling its beer Budweiser in 1875. Lord Justice Gibson said: \"When the Czech brewery sought to expand its sales into the United States in the early part of the last century, battle was joined.\" Legal action over the use of the trade mark Budweiser continued in the early 1970s when both companies began to market products in the UK. More litigation was triggered when the Czech firm successfully applied to register Bud as a trade mark. The companies are fighting over the same names after both made further applications to register them as trade marks for different beers and lagers. Lord Justice Gibson said both companies had been using the names Budweiser and Bud since the 19th century and agreed that both sides' appeals against registration by their rivals should be dismissed.",

The board had said it would take no action until a concrete allegation was received.</p> <p>The decision to pass on the DTI's grants investigation to the police comes just a few days after a departmental team interviewed Max Ayriss, the former accountant of the Birmingham-based group and the man who first alleged fraud in relation to government subsidies.</p> <p>The trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, announced the internal investigation on January 23, and two days later listed the \u00a31.3m of grants paid to TransTec between the mid-1980s and mid-90s.</p> <p>The DTI, which is not a prosecuting authority for fraud cases, said yesterday that, in the light of the interview with Mr Ayriss, \"the DTI has handed over to the West Midlands police information relating to grant payments made by the department to subsidiaries of TransTec plc and the information revealed by the department's inquiries into these matters.\"</p> <p>Mr Ayriss alleged that between 1986-88 claims for subsidies for technical innovation were falsified to inflate the amount of money TransTec was spending to develop a new electric-spark drill. He alleged that nearly \u00a3500,000 of the \u00a31.3m in DTI grants that TransTec received was fraudulently obtained.</p> <p>Mr Ayriss also alleged that Mr Robinson had planned to let out a building on Birmingham's Coleshill industrial estate after buying it with \u00a330,000 of DTI aid, purportedly for the expansion of TransTec, a move that was against the spirit if not the letter of the law.</p> <p>Last night the government shifted its stance on demands from the Conservative opposition for a parallel inquiry by the authorities in Northern Ireland into the much larger Campsie grants. The Northern Ireland Office said: \"The ... IDB is not aware of any allegations of fraudulent grant claims in relation to TransTec\", but added, for the first time, \"the IDB is reviewing its files.\"</p> <p>Peter Mandelson,the Northern Ireland secretary, had to resign a previous cabinet post in December 1998 because of an undisclosed home loan from Mr Robinson.</p> <p>Mr Robinson, who resigned as paymaster general over the Mandelson loan affair, has denied any wrongdoing in relation to TransTec.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The former treasury minister, Geoffrey Robinson, faces a full-blown fraud squad inquiry into claims that his collapsed TransTec engineering group deliberately inflated applications for government grants during the late 1980s. Investigators at the department of trade and industry yesterday handed their files on the case to West Midlands police. In another ominous development for the ex-paymaster general, the Northern Ireland Office said its industrial development board (IDB) was reviewing files relating to grants totalling \u00a36.9m for TransTec's plant at Campsie, in the west of the province. The board had said it would take no action until a concrete allegation was received. The decision to pass on the DTI's grants investigation to the police comes just a few days after a departmental team interviewed Max Ayriss, the former accountant of the Birmingham-based group and the man who first alleged fraud in relation to government subsidies. The trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, announced the internal investigation on January 23, and two days later listed the \u00a31.3m of grants paid to TransTec between the mid-1980s and mid-90s. The DTI, which is not a prosecuting authority for fraud cases, said yesterday that, in the light of the interview with Mr Ayriss, \"the DTI has handed over to the West Midlands police information relating to grant payments made by the department to subsidiaries of TransTec plc and the information revealed by the department's inquiries into these matters.\" Mr Ayriss alleged that between 1986-88 claims for subsidies for technical innovation were falsified to inflate the amount of money TransTec was spending to develop a new electric-spark drill. He alleged that nearly \u00a3500,000 of the \u00a31.3m in DTI grants that TransTec received was fraudulently obtained. Mr Ayriss also alleged that Mr Robinson had planned to let out a building on Birmingham's Coleshill industrial estate after buying it with \u00a330,000 of DTI aid, purportedly for the expansion of TransTec, a move that was against the spirit if not the letter of the law. Last night the government shifted its stance on demands from the Conservative opposition for a parallel inquiry by the authorities in Northern Ireland into the much larger Campsie grants. The Northern Ireland Office said: \"The ... IDB is not aware of any allegations of fraudulent grant claims in relation to TransTec\", but added, for the first time, \"the IDB is reviewing its files.\" Peter Mandelson,the Northern Ireland secretary, had to resign a previous cabinet post in December 1998 because of an undisclosed home loan from Mr Robinson. Mr Robinson, who resigned as paymaster general over the Mandelson loan affair, has denied any wrongdoing in relation to TransTec.",

The election of Roger Bannister, a local union official from Knowsley backed by a coalition of leftwing groups, would trigger an internal crisis in the public service union and lead to damaging conflict with Tony Blair's administration, his opponents argue. It had been assumed that victory for Dave Prentis, Mr Bickerstaffe's deputy, was a foregone conclusion. He has the overwhelming backing of Unison's executive and officialdom, and a commanding lead in branch nominations. But Mr Bannister - a member of the Socialist Party, successor to Labour's one-time Militant Tendency - is widely regarded as having run an expectedly strong campaign and the prospect that he might be elected to one of the most powerful jobs in the trade union movement is causing alarm in Downing Street. Promising to take no more than his existing pay of \u00a322,500 - rather than the \u00a369,545 available to the union's general secretary - Mr Bannister has been able to capitalise on the demoralisation of many public service workers and the continuing squeeze on their pay and conditions. By contrast, the more mainstream Mr Prentis is attracting criticism from those in the union who believe that the Unison leadership has pulled its punches with the Blair government over pay, contracting-out and the private finance initiative. \"The current leadership is too close to the government and at least as concerned with not upsetting Tony Blair as they are with a vigorous defence of jobs, pay and conditions of service,\" Mr Bannister said yesterday. He also questioned Unison's annual \u00a31.5m donation to the Labour party and called for the union to back some non-Labour candidates in local and parliamentary elections. Mr Prentis, who most insiders agree remains the favourite, countered: \"As long as I'm around, Unison will not be in the pockets of any political party and that includes the Labour party. \"I will criticise the government when it's wrong and I'll stand up to the government for Unison members and Unison policies\". Supporters of Mr Prentis, who also has some leftwing support in the union, believe that fewer than 15% of members may have yet voted - the ballot closes on February 18 - and that Mr Bannister could attract at least 100,000 votes. But they are hoping that his Militant past - he was expelled from the Labour party in 1986, along with the deputy leader of Liverpool council, Derek Hatton - will undermine his support.

The court will fix the payouts if the parties are unable to agree.</p> <p>If the offer is turned down, the paper will be able to use it as a defence when proceedings go ahead, and to argue for a smaller sum to be awarded in damages.</p> <p>There will be a special quick procedure for a judge to dispose of a claim without a jury if there seems no realistic prospect of success, or no defence to the claim.</p> <p>The judge will be able to award damages of up to \u00a310,000 and to order the defendant to publish a summary of the judgment.</p> <p>Claimants may be forced to have their case dealt with by this new procedure even if they want to go for a full hearing, if the judge decides the compensation which can be awarded is adequate.</p> <p>The changes will bring into effect those parts of the defamation act 1996 which are still outstanding.</p> <p>The lord chancellor, Lord Irvine, said: \"I am sure litigants unfortunate enough to become involved in defamation proceedings will agree that the new procedures present a marked improvement in terms of speed and efficiency for dealing with these actions.\"</p> <p>The procedures will not apply to complex libel actions like those brought by the former Tory ministers Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken, or the one by the historian David Irving against Penguin Books being heard in the high court.</p> <p>Andrew Stephenson, senior partner of the libel firm Peter Carter-Ruck &amp; Partners, said he was uncertain how effective the offer of amends would be in the majority of cases - those where more than one allegation had been made or where there were arguments over what had actually been alleged.</p> <p>But he said that the changes could encourage more people to sue.</p> <p>\"It may lead to more claims by people who would otherwise have been put off by a very expensive process.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Changes to the law to encourage more libel cases to be settled cheaply without a full trial will come into effect on February 28, the lord chancellor announced yesterday. Newspapers will be able to avoid full-scale defamation actions by making an \"offer of amends\" - agreeing to publish a correction and apology and pay appropriate damages and costs. The court will fix the payouts if the parties are unable to agree. If the offer is turned down, the paper will be able to use it as a defence when proceedings go ahead, and to argue for a smaller sum to be awarded in damages. There will be a special quick procedure for a judge to dispose of a claim without a jury if there seems no realistic prospect of success, or no defence to the claim. The judge will be able to award damages of up to \u00a310,000 and to order the defendant to publish a summary of the judgment. Claimants may be forced to have their case dealt with by this new procedure even if they want to go for a full hearing, if the judge decides the compensation which can be awarded is adequate. The changes will bring into effect those parts of the defamation act 1996 which are still outstanding. The lord chancellor, Lord Irvine, said: \"I am sure litigants unfortunate enough to become involved in defamation proceedings will agree that the new procedures present a marked improvement in terms of speed and efficiency for dealing with these actions.\" The procedures will not apply to complex libel actions like those brought by the former Tory ministers Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken, or the one by the historian David Irving against Penguin Books being heard in the high court. Andrew Stephenson, senior partner of the libel firm Peter Carter-Ruck &amp; Partners, said he was uncertain how effective the offer of amends would be in the majority of cases - those where more than one allegation had been made or where there were arguments over what had actually been alleged. But he said that the changes could encourage more people to sue. \"It may lead to more claims by people who would otherwise have been put off by a very expensive process.\"",

The Society of British Neurological Surgeons says urgent action is needed, as many neurosurgical units are often working beyond safe limits and discharging patients too early from specialist beds. The report called for an increase in specialist surgeons and beds. Critics claim that the combined effect of previous recommendations on staffing and bed levels made in 1993 are not yet being met and an increasingly elderly population is adding to the problems faced in neurosurgery. Barry Jackson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, said: \"Last year a working party from the royal college drew attention to a crisis in the provision of services for head injuries, with patients dying unnecessarily or suffering long-term consequences due to inadequate funding. \"This report makes it clear that almost all neurosurgical units are frequently working beyond their safe capacity for the same reason. The situation is urgent.\" Neurosurgeons deal with brain and spinal conditions, and much of their work is conducted on an emergency basis, treating tumours, haemorrhages and brain and spinal injuries caused by accidents. Some 29,000 of the 49,000 operations carried out last year were classified as emergencies or life-threatening. The Safe Neurosurgery Report 2000 found that of the 37 neurosurgical units in the UK, some have just one third of the beds they need to operate safely while 16 still have no designated neurosurgical intensive care spaces. The report said that 30 neurosurgical beds and four dedicated neurosurgical intensive therapy beds per 1m of the population are needed to deliver safe practice. The report also recommended that all neurosurgical units should provide 24-hour cover with a minimum of six consultant surgeons per 1.5 million people.",

      "bodyText": "William Hague's campaign to increase the number of Tory women MPs has been a dismal failure, according to a survey which found that 85% of the party's prospective candidates for the next election are men. Intensive efforts by Central Office to overturn the party's image as a bastion of white, middle class men have failed to influence local selection committees which are repeatedly turning down women. London Tories have only managed to select two women candidates in the party's 22 vacant seats, a success rate of just 9%. One of the women is the former MP, Lady Olga Maitland, who has been selected to fight Sutton and Cheam which she lost at the last election. In the East Midlands, the party is fielding one woman in the nine vacant seats. Pauline Latham will fight Broxtowe where Labour enjoys a majority of nearly 6,000.

Linchpin Ken Stott is all weaselly energy as Inspector Pat Chappel, while Harewood plays the hapless sidekick (complete with obligatory marital problems) with rare conviction.

After three weeks of being a decidedly mixed blessing, uncertain in its tone and with a few great performances overpowered by a more general shout-fest, it suddenly turned into what it should have been all along - dark, chilling, powerful drama. There were no comic schoolmasters, no dithering Dot Cotton, no freaky twins this week - and once Warren Mitchell had been dispatched (thus releasing the audience from one of the worst-judged performances in the whole show) we could settle down and concentrate on what is, after all, a fairly simple story. Jonathan Rhys Meyers, in full jackbooted fascist regalia, seemed, at last, to get the measure of Steerpike; his scenes with the older, more desperate Fuchsia (Neve McIntosh) were the highlight of the series. The closing moments, with Steerpike bobbing around a flooded room, fighting for his life with a catapult, had the authentic taste of a Mervyn Peake nightmare. </p> <p>Earlier in the evening, Channel 4 revisited the legend of the great Victorian explorer Sir Richard Burton in the first of a new series of To The Ends Of The Earth. Burton, with mentally unstable sidekick John Hanning Speke, set off in 1856 to discover the source of the White Nile, then one of the world's unsolved geographic mysteries. Their journey, dogged by disease and personal animus, was repeated by Burton's biographer Michael Asher, in a re-run of that well-worn television conceit that we can somehow get closer to our subject by going where he went, seeing what he saw, smelling what he smelt. In this instance, the journey proved enlightening for Asher but frustrating for the rest of us. Hints were dropped about Burton's avant-garde sexual tastes (arriving in Zanzibar he'd whipped out a tape measure and noted a local man's penis which \"when quiescent numbered nearly six inches\") - but after that we got lost in an unremarkable travelogue.

However, this has been prefaced by the words \"the summer I killed my father I was 10 years old,\" spoken by daughter Eve, and cracks in the facade appear after she sees her father having sex with another woman. Slowly, the build-up to a violent denouement unfolds, via detours into the stories of various family members. </p> <p> <strong> Camilla Redmond Bound</strong> (Larry Wachowski, Andy Wachowski, 1996) 10.30pm, FilmFour </p> <p>It's interesting to see what the Wachowski brothers were doing before The (massive) Matrix, even if it's pretty disappointing. The arresting pulp-plot has Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon (pictured) in a lesbians-against-the-mob pairing, with Joe Pantoliano a laughably nasty boss. With a little more humour and a little less heavy contrivance it might have made a great cult movie, but instead it's like a cheap and tacky Thelma and Louise. </p> <p><strong> The Lightship</strong> (Jerzy Skolimowski, 1985) 1am, Carlton Cinema Psychotic Robert Duva </p> <p>ll and his ugly escapee henchmen hijack a lightship off the Norfolk, Virginia coast, but the captain is impassive Klaus Maria Brandauer and the baddies have run their flag up the wrong pole. Good, glowering performances and a suspenseful clash of light and dark, good and evil, in a drama reminiscent of Huston's Key Largo. </p> <p><strong> The Set Up</strong> (Robert Wise, 1948) 4.40am, Sky Cinema </p> <p>Knock-out boxing drama shot in black-and-spotlight-white, with unbeatable Robert Ryan as a veteran rebelling against local hoods' pressure to throw a fight (a prototype for Bruce Willis's Butch in Pulp Fiction): elation at victory in a brutal bout turns to terror as he faces retribution. Audrey Totter is the woman sick of the viciousness of this \"sporting\" life. At times despairing, but finally uplifting.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Eve's Bayou (Kasi Lemmons, 1997) 10pm, SkyPremier Set in Louisiana in the 50s, writer/director Kasi Lemmons' film introduces a seemingly perfect family: doctor Louis (Samuel L Jackson), his wife Roz and their three children. However, this has been prefaced by the words \"the summer I killed my father I was 10 years old,\" spoken by daughter Eve, and cracks in the facade appear after she sees her father having sex with another woman. Slowly, the build-up to a violent denouement unfolds, via detours into the stories of various family members. Camilla Redmond Bound (Larry Wachowski, Andy Wachowski, 1996) 10.30pm, FilmFour It's interesting to see what the Wachowski brothers were doing before The (massive) Matrix, even if it's pretty disappointing. The arresting pulp-plot has Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon (pictured) in a lesbians-against-the-mob pairing, with Joe Pantoliano a laughably nasty boss. With a little more humour and a little less heavy contrivance it might have made a great cult movie, but instead it's like a cheap and tacky Thelma and Louise. The Lightship (Jerzy Skolimowski, 1985) 1am, Carlton Cinema Psychotic Robert Duva ll and his ugly escapee henchmen hijack a lightship off the Norfolk, Virginia coast, but the captain is impassive Klaus Maria Brandauer and the baddies have run their flag up the wrong pole. Good, glowering performances and a suspenseful clash of light and dark, good and evil, in a drama reminiscent of Huston's Key Largo. The Set Up (Robert Wise, 1948) 4.40am, Sky Cinema Knock-out boxing drama shot in black-and-spotlight-white, with unbeatable Robert Ryan as a veteran rebelling against local hoods' pressure to throw a fight (a prototype for Bruce Willis's Butch in Pulp Fiction): elation at victory in a brutal bout turns to terror as he faces retribution. Audrey Totter is the woman sick of the viciousness of this \"sporting\" life. At times despairing, but finally uplifting.",

It was the third major inquiry conducted by Layfield, following his work on the Greater London development plan and into local government finance.</p> <p>The Sizewell B case became, at 340 days, the country's longest-lasting and most expensive public inquiry, and it gave Layfield the opportunity to deploy talents that won him widespread respect, if not universal support. In 1987, four years after the first hearing, he published his 3,000-page report, which concluded that the PWR would be in the national interest. Eight years later, in a different energy world, it began its commercial operation.</p> <p>For many years before he retired in 1992, Layfield had been pre-eminent at the planning and local government bar. At the height of his practice, there were few major planning inquiries at which he did not appear. He had an exceptional ability to master the detail of complex inquiries, requiring not only a clear understanding of planning law and policy, but also a firm grasp of the many technical issues they raise. Perhaps even more importantly, he was a masterful, thorough, effective - but courteous - cross-examiner. Many thought his skills unparalleled.</p> <p>Layfield took silk in 1967. Within two years he was invited by the then Labour government to chair the public inquiry into the Greater London development plan, which became the longest planning inquiry of the day, with his report, delivered in 1973, criticising, among other things, the then extant motorway ring scheme around London.</p> <p>Soon afterwards, Layfield was called upon again to chair a committee of inquiry, this time into local government finance. This lasted for 18 months and many of its recommendations were thought at the time to be radical.</p> <p>Layfield was born in Toronto, came to England at the age of 11, and was educated at Sevenoaks school. Joining the army in 1940, he served in the Royal Corps of Signals in the Middle East, India and Burma. After the war, he spent time at the ministry of town and country planning - where he was concerned with the establishment of new towns - and with a firm of planning consultants.</p> <p>He then read for the bar, was called in 1954 and became a pupil of Arthur Irvine, latterly solicitor-general in Harold Wilson's second administration, from 1967-70. Layfield became a tenant in 1957 in the chambers of Scott Henderson QC, and from there built up an extensive practice in the field of planning and local government. His initial success was due largely to his specialist knowledge of the planning system, which few at the bar in those days shared.</p> <p>Following his work on the local government finance inquiry, Layfield was knighted in 1976. He appeared at most major planning inquiries, and on many private bills in parliament (including Windscale), representing ICI when it successfully pushed through its Boulby potash mine in a national park, No 1 Poultry, in the City of London, Cow Green reservoir and the Paddington to Heathrow rail link. He was accorded the rare honour for a practising barrister of being elected an associate of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, on the council of which he sat for many years, and an honorary fellow of the Incorporated Society of Valuers and Auctioneers.</p> <p>Layfield never forgot his initial grounding in the common law, and took an appointment in 1979 as a crown court recorder. In 1974, he was elected a bencher of Gray's Inn. In 1975, he became head of his chambers (on the retirement of Sir Joseph Molony), and in 1990 led his colleagues into their new accommodation at 1 Serjeants Inn, from where he retired.</p> <p>He brought to his private life all the enthusiasm and charm which marked and promoted his professional success. Following service in the war, he joined the Honourable Artillery Company and ended up a major. He commanded a platoon of the HAC, which acted as the guard of honour to the Queen on one of her visits to the City. To the end, his shoes always shone. He was a keen and active liveryman. He played tennis and squash.</p> <p>Friends remember with nostalgia many a game of squash before an inquiry in the City - and even in the middle of the night during a long inquiry at Billingham. He was an enthusiastic walker, often covering sections of the Cleveland Way during inquiries in the north-east.</p> <p>In Patricia Harvey, whom he married in 1965, he chose the perfect wife, and was devoted to their two children. When he and Pat moved to a Georgian house at Beckley with a large unkempt garden, Frank devoted to his garden all the enthusiasm and attention to detail which he had brought to everything else, double digging all the borders in the process. His kindness and humour brought him many friends.</p> <p>He is surved by his wife, son and daughter.</p> <p>Sir Frank Henry Burland Willoughby Layfield, barrister, born August 9 1921; died February 2 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "In 1982, the planning lawyer Sir Frank Layfield, who has died aged 78, was invited by the then Conservative government to preside as inspector at the public inquiry into the central electricity generating board's proposals to build a pressurised water reactor, Sizewell B, alongside the Magnox Sizewell A at the Suffolk nuclear power station. It was the third major inquiry conducted by Layfield, following his work on the Greater London development plan and into local government finance. The Sizewell B case became, at 340 days, the country's longest-lasting and most expensive public inquiry, and it gave Layfield the opportunity to deploy talents that won him widespread respect, if not universal support. In 1987, four years after the first hearing, he published his 3,000-page report, which concluded that the PWR would be in the national interest. Eight years later, in a different energy world, it began its commercial operation. For many years before he retired in 1992, Layfield had been pre-eminent at the planning and local government bar. At the height of his practice, there were few major planning inquiries at which he did not appear. He had an exceptional ability to master the detail of complex inquiries, requiring not only a clear understanding of planning law and policy, but also a firm grasp of the many technical issues they raise. Perhaps even more importantly, he was a masterful, thorough, effective - but courteous - cross-examiner. Many thought his skills unparalleled. Layfield took silk in 1967. Within two years he was invited by the then Labour government to chair the public inquiry into the Greater London development plan, which became the longest planning inquiry of the day, with his report, delivered in 1973, criticising, among other things, the then extant motorway ring scheme around London. Soon afterwards, Layfield was called upon again to chair a committee of inquiry, this time into local government finance. This lasted for 18 months and many of its recommendations were thought at the time to be radical. Layfield was born in Toronto, came to England at the age of 11, and was educated at Sevenoaks school. Joining the army in 1940, he served in the Royal Corps of Signals in the Middle East, India and Burma. After the war, he spent time at the ministry of town and country planning - where he was concerned with the establishment of new towns - and with a firm of planning consultants. He then read for the bar, was called in 1954 and became a pupil of Arthur Irvine, latterly solicitor-general in Harold Wilson's second administration, from 1967-70. Layfield became a tenant in 1957 in the chambers of Scott Henderson QC, and from there built up an extensive practice in the field of planning and local government. His initial success was due largely to his specialist knowledge of the planning system, which few at the bar in those days shared. Following his work on the local government finance inquiry, Layfield was knighted in 1976. He appeared at most major planning inquiries, and on many private bills in parliament (including Windscale), representing ICI when it successfully pushed through its Boulby potash mine in a national park, No 1 Poultry, in the City of London, Cow Green reservoir and the Paddington to Heathrow rail link. He was accorded the rare honour for a practising barrister of being elected an associate of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, on the council of which he sat for many years, and an honorary fellow of the Incorporated Society of Valuers and Auctioneers. Layfield never forgot his initial grounding in the common law, and took an appointment in 1979 as a crown court recorder. In 1974, he was elected a bencher of Gray's Inn. In 1975, he became head of his chambers (on the retirement of Sir Joseph Molony), and in 1990 led his colleagues into their new accommodation at 1 Serjeants Inn, from where he retired. He brought to his private life all the enthusiasm and charm which marked and promoted his professional success. Following service in the war, he joined the Honourable Artillery Company and ended up a major. He commanded a platoon of the HAC, which acted as the guard of honour to the Queen on one of her visits to the City. To the end, his shoes always shone. He was a keen and active liveryman. He played tennis and squash. Friends remember with nostalgia many a game of squash before an inquiry in the City - and even in the middle of the night during a long inquiry at Billingham. He was an enthusiastic walker, often covering sections of the Cleveland Way during inquiries in the north-east. In Patricia Harvey, whom he married in 1965, he chose the perfect wife, and was devoted to their two children. When he and Pat moved to a Georgian house at Beckley with a large unkempt garden, Frank devoted to his garden all the enthusiasm and attention to detail which he had brought to everything else, double digging all the borders in the process. His kindness and humour brought him many friends. He is surved by his wife, son and daughter. Sir Frank Henry Burland Willoughby Layfield, barrister, born August 9 1921; died February 2 2000",

The south-west - home to 20m Yorubas and the commercial hub, Lagos - claims to have been robbed of political influence by decades of northern-dominated military rule. The northern Hausa-Fulani protest that southerners own the economy.</p> <p>Years of military rule and plunder have taken their toll on Nigeria's standing in the world. But at home a grand conspiracy by their compatriots is what the various of Nigeria complain of most.</p> <p>At the heart of the south-west's burgeoning ethnic nationalism is the Oodua People's Congress (OPC), a Yoruba separatist movement founded six years ago to oppose military rule. It is blamed for much of the killings of hundreds of Hausas and eastern Igbos in and around Lagos in recent months, provoking retaliatory massacres of Yorubas in other parts of Nigeria.</p> <p>The OPC is scorned by many businessmen and mainstream politicians. But the organisation's popularity has surged among the mass of poor in Lagos keen to find someone to blame for their plight. One of its leaders, Gani Adams, is a folk hero after eluding capture even though the police put a price on his head for leading ethnic killings.</p> <p>The OPC has some prominent supporters. Its treasurer is Beko Ransome-Kuti, a former political prisoner of the military whose late brother, Fela Kuti, was Nigeria's most famous and politicised singer.</p> <p>\"This concept called Nigeria is of very doubtful viability,\" Mr Ransome-Kuti said. \"There is just nothing you can call one Nigeria and the earlier we appreciate that the better or we'll end up in dire straits ... Everything revolves around the ethnic factor.</p> <p>\"The north wants to control everything. The OPC is here to make sure that the south-west, or the Yorubas, are emancipated from northern oppression.\" Regional rivalry is partly driven by differences over how Nigeria is governed. The north, with few resources, backs big government and shared national wealth, particularly the oil revenues. It relies on the civil service to provide jobs and views the fashion for privatisation as a threat to its hegemony over vast state enterprises.</p> <p>The south-west is scornful of the pervasive federal administration, blaming it for corruption, inefficiency and the collapse of much of Nigeria's infrastructure.</p> <p>Mr Ransome-Kuti says the OPC favours a return to the handful of largely self-governing regions that existed when the army first seized power in 1966. If it cannot win agreement on devolution, he says the organisation will declare independence.</p> <p>But if the south-west were to win even a measure of autonomy it would help galvanise the demand for self-government among the splintered ethnic movements in the oil-rich Niger Delta. That is one of the north's great fears because oil underpins the economy.</p> <p>The OPC's rise has provoked the creation of a rival organisation, the Arewa People's Congress, to \"safeguard northern interests\". Its chairman, Sagir Mohammed, accuses the OPC of \"unleashing terror\". When the police offered a 100,000 naira (\u00a36,000) reward for Mr Adams's capture, the APC doubled it.</p> <p>\"Our motto is to preserve the territorial indivisibility of the country,\" Mr Mohammed said. \"No matter how peaceful you may want to be, you may find you have been pushed to the limit and you are forced to respond with violence. The OPC's long-term objective is the balkanisation of the country. This is a threat to our nascent democracy.\"</p> <p>Southern suspicions have been fuelled by the spread of sharia law. Although Islamic courts have existed for years in the Muslim north, they have heard civil cases only. Now one state, Zamfara, has made sharia the principal criminal code and used it to close bars, segregate schools and transport, and enforce a dress code. Five other states with significant Christian minorities are moving in a similar direction.</p> <p>Underpinning the rise in Yoruba nationalism is disappointment with President Olusegun Obasanjo's democratic government, which took office last May, and fears of a return to military rule.</p> <p>Mr Obasanjo, whose status as a Yoruba and a former military ruler puts him in both camps and neither, has been attacked by all sides. The north complains his government has too many Yorubas; the south-west protests that he constantly bows to northern pressure on issues such as sharia.</p> <p>Mr Obasanjo has skilfully neutralised the army for now. But the OPC says that if the government fails to deliver, the military will be back.</p> <p>\"I know some of their fears,\" said the president. \"I tell them that you don't solve that problem by severing ties. You solve that by strengthening the institutions that prevent a repeat of the past.</p> <p>\"I will admit that people have reason to be suspicious. The ethnic differences are there. Religious differences are there. But there are more important things to worry about, like injustice and poverty.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The end of military rule nine months ago has unleashed a store of bitter resentments in Nigeria that have fueled ethnic massacres, the rise of militant regional organisations and a rush to introduce sharia law in the Islamic north over the virulent protests of Christians. It has all raised a question no one has dared contemplate seriously since the bloody civil war over Biafra 30 years ago: is it time to dissolve Nigeria? The recent troubles come on top of long-standing grievances and divisions. The east, which tasted separation briefly as Biafra during the war, provides the country's massive oil revenues but has little to show beyond devastating pollution. The south-west - home to 20m Yorubas and the commercial hub, Lagos - claims to have been robbed of political influence by decades of northern-dominated military rule. The northern Hausa-Fulani protest that southerners own the economy. Years of military rule and plunder have taken their toll on Nigeria's standing in the world. But at home a grand conspiracy by their compatriots is what the various of Nigeria complain of most. At the heart of the south-west's burgeoning ethnic nationalism is the Oodua People's Congress (OPC), a Yoruba separatist movement founded six years ago to oppose military rule. It is blamed for much of the killings of hundreds of Hausas and eastern Igbos in and around Lagos in recent months, provoking retaliatory massacres of Yorubas in other parts of Nigeria. The OPC is scorned by many businessmen and mainstream politicians. But the organisation's popularity has surged among the mass of poor in Lagos keen to find someone to blame for their plight. One of its leaders, Gani Adams, is a folk hero after eluding capture even though the police put a price on his head for leading ethnic killings. The OPC has some prominent supporters. Its treasurer is Beko Ransome-Kuti, a former political prisoner of the military whose late brother, Fela Kuti, was Nigeria's most famous and politicised singer. \"This concept called Nigeria is of very doubtful viability,\" Mr Ransome-Kuti said. \"There is just nothing you can call one Nigeria and the earlier we appreciate that the better or we'll end up in dire straits ... Everything revolves around the ethnic factor. \"The north wants to control everything. The OPC is here to make sure that the south-west, or the Yorubas, are emancipated from northern oppression.\" Regional rivalry is partly driven by differences over how Nigeria is governed. The north, with few resources, backs big government and shared national wealth, particularly the oil revenues. It relies on the civil service to provide jobs and views the fashion for privatisation as a threat to its hegemony over vast state enterprises. The south-west is scornful of the pervasive federal administration, blaming it for corruption, inefficiency and the collapse of much of Nigeria's infrastructure. Mr Ransome-Kuti says the OPC favours a return to the handful of largely self-governing regions that existed when the army first seized power in 1966. If it cannot win agreement on devolution, he says the organisation will declare independence. But if the south-west were to win even a measure of autonomy it would help galvanise the demand for self-government among the splintered ethnic movements in the oil-rich Niger Delta. That is one of the north's great fears because oil underpins the economy. The OPC's rise has provoked the creation of a rival organisation, the Arewa People's Congress, to \"safeguard northern interests\". Its chairman, Sagir Mohammed, accuses the OPC of \"unleashing terror\". When the police offered a 100,000 naira (\u00a36,000) reward for Mr Adams's capture, the APC doubled it. \"Our motto is to preserve the territorial indivisibility of the country,\" Mr Mohammed said. \"No matter how peaceful you may want to be, you may find you have been pushed to the limit and you are forced to respond with violence. The OPC's long-term objective is the balkanisation of the country. This is a threat to our nascent democracy.\" Southern suspicions have been fuelled by the spread of sharia law. Although Islamic courts have existed for years in the Muslim north, they have heard civil cases only. Now one state, Zamfara, has made sharia the principal criminal code and used it to close bars, segregate schools and transport, and enforce a dress code. Five other states with significant Christian minorities are moving in a similar direction. Underpinning the rise in Yoruba nationalism is disappointment with President Olusegun Obasanjo's democratic government, which took office last May, and fears of a return to military rule. Mr Obasanjo, whose status as a Yoruba and a former military ruler puts him in both camps and neither, has been attacked by all sides. The north complains his government has too many Yorubas; the south-west protests that he constantly bows to northern pressure on issues such as sharia. Mr Obasanjo has skilfully neutralised the army for now. But the OPC says that if the government fails to deliver, the military will be back. \"I know some of their fears,\" said the president. \"I tell them that you don't solve that problem by severing ties. You solve that by strengthening the institutions that prevent a repeat of the past. \"I will admit that people have reason to be suspicious. The ethnic differences are there. Religious differences are there. But there are more important things to worry about, like injustice and poverty.\"",

      "bodyText": "A sensational political murder trial in this microscopic south Pacific island nation is expected to take a dramatic turn today when a person known only as witness E takes the stand. The secret witness's testimony is considered crucial in the prosecution's case against two former cabinet ministers, Leafa Vitale and Toi Aukuso, who are on trial for murder. The two parliamentarians, who respectively held the portfolios of women's affairs and public works, are charged jointly with the murder of the former public works minister, Luagalau Levaula Kamu, in revenge for Mr Vitale losing his portfolio to the slain minister. Mr Kamu, 44, was killed last July with a single shot from a M16 assault rifle just after he had been speaking at a function to mark the 20th anniversary of the ruling Human Right Protection party (HRPP). Mr Kamu was briefly leaving the stage to take a telephone call from his daughter when the shot rang out. The trial, which is currently in its fourth week, is seen by his critics as comeuppance for Mr Vitale, who for the past decade has led something of a charmed life. He has been the subject of a number of official inquiries and insurance investigations during the past 10 years, including for death threats allegedly made by him against two newspaper editors and several senior public servants. Mr Vitale was also allegedly involved in an elaborate insurance scam in 1989, whereby he faked his own death in Honolulu in order that his family could collect the payout, a matter for which he is still wanted for questioning by the FBI in the US, which has no extradition treaty with Samoa. Only one previous case brought against him has ever gone to court - and it was dismissed. Mr Vitale's son, 34-year-old Elitise Leafa Vitale, has already pleaded guilty to murdering the late cabinet minister, and is serving a life sentence for the killing. Members of Elitise's family have been given asylum and new identities in New Zealand, to protect them from possible retribution from associates of the elder Mr Vitale, according to a diplomatic source close to the case.

      "bodyText": "Yugoslavia's defence minister was shot dead last night as he ate in the restaurant of a Belgrade football stadium, the latest and the highest-ranking victim of a spate of gangland-style political killings. Pavle Bulatovic, who had held the post for seven years, was the second prominent ally of President Slobodan Milosevic to be gunned down in the city in less than a month. The Serb warlord Arkan died in the lobby of the Intercontinental hotel, in Belgrade, on January 15. Immediately after last night's killing, the government went into emergency session and declared Mr Bulatovic had been the victim of terrorism. \"The federal government states with deepest sorrow and sadness that Pavle Bulatovic, the federal minister of defence, was killed this evening in Belgrade,\" a statement on Yugoslav state television, said. \"The federal government gives its full support to the relevant state organs in their uncompromising struggle against terrorism.\" The statement added that the government expressed its \"gratitude and respect for the contribution that Pavle Bulatovic gave in the defence, affirmation and development of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and sends deepest condolences to his family.\" Police said the killer struck at 6.55pm local time, firing with an automatic weapon from the stadium's football pitch through the restaurant window. Mr Bulatovic, 51, was a senior member of the Socialist People's party, a Montenegrin party loyal to Mr Milosevic, which is in opposition in Montenegro, but is in government at the federal level. As well as being a close ally of Mr Milosevic, Mr Bulatovic was very close to Momir Bulatovic, the Yugoslav premier. The two men were not related. Born in the Montenegrin village of Gornji Rovci, he was married and had three children.Bulatovic was largely a figurehead, with all the major decisions being made by Mr Milosevic. From 1992 to 1994 he served as Yugoslav interior minister in the government of Milan Panic, a Serb-born businessman who was later sacked by Mr Milosevic. It was not immediately clear whether the minister, who was hit from behind, had died at the scene or later in hospital. The independent Studio B TV company reported that two men sitting at the same table were wounded and were taken to a military hospital nearby. A few hours after the shooting, the table where Mr Bulatovic sat was still covered with blood and the floor was littered with debris. More than a dozen prominent people, some close to Mr Milosevic, have been killed in Belgrade in the past 10 years. Most of the killings have never been solved. Other recent victims have included Dragan Simic, a young and ambitious police colonel, who was shot dead in a Belgrade car park last year; Slavko Curuvija, a prominent independent journalist and publisher critical of the Serbian authorities, who was gunned down outside his Belgrade apartment block last year during Nato air strikes against Yugoslavia; and Milorad Vlahovic another police colonel and the assistant head of the Belgrade homicide department who was also shot dead in a car park last year. Miodrag Vlahovic, a political commentator in Montenegro's capital, Podgorica, said that the killing of Mr Bulatovic could be the result of a \"conflict of interests\" concerning business dealings between senior Yugoslav officials. \"The country in which the defence minister was killed like that in a restaurant is a real banana republic.

      "body": "<p>After winning the bidding war for Mannesmann and ruffling a lot of German feathers in the process, Vodafone AirTouch's chief, Chris Gent, will be spending time in D\u00fcsseldorf this week trying to win the peace. </p> <p>It will not be an easy task, not least because of the problems of integrating two business cultures within what will be the world's fourth-biggest corporate group. </p> <p>There will be others within the telecommunications industry, however, who will be watching Mr Gent's progress with interest, even envy. Many of the Gent watchers will be in the boardrooms of former state-owned telecoms monopolies still looking to come to terms with post- deregulation life in the private sector. </p> <p>Where once their sprawling organisations held undisputed sway and Vodafone was simply a gleam in Sir Ernest Harrison's eye, the mobile phone companies have made huge inroads into the telecoms market. And this is not just the one serving commuters who cannot live without telling their colleagues they are on the way into the office or their partners they are on the way home. </p> <p>The introduction of WAP (wireless application protocol) will mean that new-generation mobile phones will be able to receive anything from news bulletins, sports results and restaurant ratings to email and, eventually, music and video clips. </p> <p>Even the traditional strength of the once-state-owned corporations - their fixed-line networks - is under threat as they are forced by national regulators to open these to upstart competition. </p> <p>Little wonder that the likes of British Telecommunications, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, under chief executive Ron Sommer, are doing some serious strategic thinking. </p> <p>BT is said to be on the brink of its biggest shake-up since privatisation; the German group, which bought mobile operator One2One last year, is rumoured to be dusting off its plans for an alliance with Telecom Italia - now owned by Olivetti; France Telecom has just shelled out for Global One - its alliance with Deutsche Telekom and US group Sprint. Both France Telecom and its Dutch equivalent, KPN, are hotly tipped as bidders for Britain's Orange. </p> <p>Indeed, events at Global One illustrate a crucial problem facing the former state sector - and not so former in the case of Deutsche Telekom where Berlin still holds two-thirds of the shares. While the alliance was destabilised by Deutsche Telekom's bid for Telecom Italia because it infuriated France Telecom, it was Sprint's agreement to merge with MCI WorldCom which broke up the partnership and gave France Telecom full control. </p> <p>BT's own global ambitions had earlier suffered a similar setback when WorldCom thwarted the British player's planned merger with MCI. </p> <p>The problem is not one of size. Vodafone, via the AirTouch and Mannesmann acquisitions which give it access to the US, Germany and Italy (where Mannesmann brings in Omnitel), and Spain through the share stake in Airtel - and Mr Gent firmly expects to knock out BT's own holding - is a very formidable presence. </p> <p>But Deutsche Telekom is no minnow.

      "bodyText": "After winning the bidding war for Mannesmann and ruffling a lot of German feathers in the process, Vodafone AirTouch's chief, Chris Gent, will be spending time in D\u00fcsseldorf this week trying to win the peace. It will not be an easy task, not least because of the problems of integrating two business cultures within what will be the world's fourth-biggest corporate group. There will be others within the telecommunications industry, however, who will be watching Mr Gent's progress with interest, even envy. Many of the Gent watchers will be in the boardrooms of former state-owned telecoms monopolies still looking to come to terms with post- deregulation life in the private sector. Where once their sprawling organisations held undisputed sway and Vodafone was simply a gleam in Sir Ernest Harrison's eye, the mobile phone companies have made huge inroads into the telecoms market. And this is not just the one serving commuters who cannot live without telling their colleagues they are on the way into the office or their partners they are on the way home. The introduction of WAP (wireless application protocol) will mean that new-generation mobile phones will be able to receive anything from news bulletins, sports results and restaurant ratings to email and, eventually, music and video clips. Even the traditional strength of the once-state-owned corporations - their fixed-line networks - is under threat as they are forced by national regulators to open these to upstart competition. Little wonder that the likes of British Telecommunications, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, under chief executive Ron Sommer, are doing some serious strategic thinking. BT is said to be on the brink of its biggest shake-up since privatisation; the German group, which bought mobile operator One2One last year, is rumoured to be dusting off its plans for an alliance with Telecom Italia - now owned by Olivetti; France Telecom has just shelled out for Global One - its alliance with Deutsche Telekom and US group Sprint. Both France Telecom and its Dutch equivalent, KPN, are hotly tipped as bidders for Britain's Orange. Indeed, events at Global One illustrate a crucial problem facing the former state sector - and not so former in the case of Deutsche Telekom where Berlin still holds two-thirds of the shares. While the alliance was destabilised by Deutsche Telekom's bid for Telecom Italia because it infuriated France Telecom, it was Sprint's agreement to merge with MCI WorldCom which broke up the partnership and gave France Telecom full control. BT's own global ambitions had earlier suffered a similar setback when WorldCom thwarted the British player's planned merger with MCI. The problem is not one of size. Vodafone, via the AirTouch and Mannesmann acquisitions which give it access to the US, Germany and Italy (where Mannesmann brings in Omnitel), and Spain through the share stake in Airtel - and Mr Gent firmly expects to knock out BT's own holding - is a very formidable presence. But Deutsche Telekom is no minnow. Its market capitalisation - the shares have more than doubled in the past nine months - is now close to \u00a3160bn. France Telecom - another company to enjoy a big run-up in the share price - is worth just over \u00a3100bn. Even BT, where the share price has fallen sharply since the beginning of the year, is worth \u00a370bn. Vodafone before Mannesmann was worth \u00a3104bn; after the merger its value is more than three times that of BT. But there is the question of growth. Mr Gent remains convinced that the best returns for shareholders lie in mobiles rather than in the integrated fixed-line and wireless approach favoured by Klaus Esser at Mannesmann - and the bulk of investors backed his conviction. The best prospects are in the fastest-growing areas of the telecoms market and they come unencumbered by the baggage of the past - a huge fixed infrastructure or a civil service-style bureaucracy. To remedy that imbalance some of the traditional businesses are trying to show off their high-growth areas. Deutsche Telekom is to float its internet business, T Online, this spring and then mobile phone business T Mobile. BT boss Sir Peter Bonfield has been quoted as saying that his company is looking at breaking out the figures from the different businesses such as Cellnet and Concert, and might even consider listing these separately. At least one strand of the Deutsche Telekom strategy is clear. The German group has said it will use T Online shares to fund acquisitions. After all, internet entrepreneurs are more likely to accept shares in a similar company than equity in a more broadly based business. The problem is somehow to get the share price bounce which should come from highlighting the fast-growing areas of the business against making sure that the original company derives the maximum benefits from the new ventures. It is a dilemma that needs a quick resolution. Just in time for the next step change in the industry - the third-generation mobile phones which will be able to process the sort of data required for television pictures and films. The day of the household without fixed telephone links is already on the horizon. The old boys will need to shape up.",

The company will, however, pick up a consolation payment of $1.8bn which will help fund lawsuits related to two of its former diet products.

Royal Bank of Scotland had little choice but to respond. It could not risk its closest competitor gaining the (different) advantages each sees in acquiring NatWest. </p> <p>Nothing wrong with that, and the two banks can claim they have superior management records although it is by no means automatic that such superiority would transfer successfully to NatWest. Each has argued fiercely that it has a better vision than the other (and NatWest's incumbent management) for the future but neither has presented a case compellingly better than its rival. </p> <p>As for NatWest, large parts of its defence have rested on annexing chunks of the bidders' strategies. Its best chance lies in splitting those voting against its being allowed to retain its independence. Yet it will have little to crow about if it escapes with less than 50% support. </p> <p>Over the next couple of days both bidders will be desperate to get a bandwagon of acceptances rolling in order to bring on board those investors who cannot decide between the offers but don't believe NatWest deserves to get away. </p> <p><strong> Mobile war </strong><br> </p> <p> Last weekend, in Munich, Bill Cohen and Geoff Hoon, US and UK defence secretaries, signed a ringing declaration to enable British contractors to penetrate the lucrative (and growing) American market. The Yanks are already over here and, as the recent Boeing advertisements underline, sending more troops and equipment. But can the Brits (and Europeans) compete on home ground? </p> <p>Today the Archer consortium, effectively run by BAE Systems, will make a critical decision - on 56,000 VHF radios ensuring secure data and voice communication on the battlefield: next-generation military mobile phones - that could determine whether Britain retains a capability in defence technology or opts for a US solution. </p> <p>BAE faces the unenviable task of choosing between two of its Archer partners: Racal (being bought by the French) and America's ITT. Racal argues that it offers a cheaper, proven version; a tactical internet system; up to \u00a31bn in domestic orders and exports; and at least 1,100 skilled British jobs. ITT offers a version already in use by the US army. </p> <p>The radios, replacing 1970s Clansman kit shown to be wholly inadequate in Kosovo where they could be overheard by Serbs, are eight years overdue but Racal says they could enter service well ahead of the 2003 timeframe set by the MoD. The crucial issue for the armed forces, however, is not whether they are European or American: it is that they arrive on time and work. </p> <p><strong> Gold fever </strong><br> </p> <p> Suddenly gold is back in favour. The price rocketed by $23 late on Friday and was up another $10 yesterday. </p> <p>So are gold bugs getting their revenge on central banks whose sales did so much to drive down the price to a 20-year low last September by subtly suggesting that inflation might be getting out of control and that the precious metal remains the safest haven? </p> <p>It is a nice thought but unlikely. The explanation appears to lie in the decision by gold producers to reduce their forward sales - that is, selling gold they have yet to produce. News that the Canadian company Placer Dome, the world's fifth-largest miner, on Friday that it was suspending its \"hedging\" programme pushed the market higher on Friday, and yesterday AngloGold, the world's number one producer, said it had been reducing its hedge position during the past four months. </p> <p>Analysts reckon that the reduction in forward selling is offsetting the impact of central bank gold sales, thus pushing up the price - rather than any perception of central bank complacency on the inflation front. Still, the recovery in price might attract attention from investors worried that equity and bond markets are looking just a bit on the toppy side.</p>",

Its best chance lies in splitting those voting against its being allowed to retain its independence. Yet it will have little to crow about if it escapes with less than 50% support. Over the next couple of days both bidders will be desperate to get a bandwagon of acceptances rolling in order to bring on board those investors who cannot decide between the offers but don't believe NatWest deserves to get away. Mobile war Last weekend, in Munich, Bill Cohen and Geoff Hoon, US and UK defence secretaries, signed a ringing declaration to enable British contractors to penetrate the lucrative (and growing) American market. The Yanks are already over here and, as the recent Boeing advertisements underline, sending more troops and equipment. But can the Brits (and Europeans) compete on home ground? Today the Archer consortium, effectively run by BAE Systems, will make a critical decision - on 56,000 VHF radios ensuring secure data and voice communication on the battlefield: next-generation military mobile phones - that could determine whether Britain retains a capability in defence technology or opts for a US solution. BAE faces the unenviable task of choosing between two of its Archer partners: Racal (being bought by the French) and America's ITT. Racal argues that it offers a cheaper, proven version; a tactical internet system; up to \u00a31bn in domestic orders and exports; and at least 1,100 skilled British jobs. ITT offers a version already in use by the US army. The radios, replacing 1970s Clansman kit shown to be wholly inadequate in Kosovo where they could be overheard by Serbs, are eight years overdue but Racal says they could enter service well ahead of the 2003 timeframe set by the MoD. The crucial issue for the armed forces, however, is not whether they are European or American: it is that they arrive on time and work. Gold fever Suddenly gold is back in favour. The price rocketed by $23 late on Friday and was up another $10 yesterday. So are gold bugs getting their revenge on central banks whose sales did so much to drive down the price to a 20-year low last September by subtly suggesting that inflation might be getting out of control and that the precious metal remains the safest haven? It is a nice thought but unlikely. The explanation appears to lie in the decision by gold producers to reduce their forward sales - that is, selling gold they have yet to produce. News that the Canadian company Placer Dome, the world's fifth-largest miner, on Friday that it was suspending its \"hedging\" programme pushed the market higher on Friday, and yesterday AngloGold, the world's number one producer, said it had been reducing its hedge position during the past four months. Analysts reckon that the reduction in forward selling is offsetting the impact of central bank gold sales, thus pushing up the price - rather than any perception of central bank complacency on the inflation front. Still, the recovery in price might attract attention from investors worried that equity and bond markets are looking just a bit on the toppy side.",

      "body": "<p>Last week Michael Craig-Martin reconstructed his 1972 installation of a hidden electric fan and viewing mirrors in the Whitechapel Art Gallery. It is part of the exhibition Live in Your Head, a survey of British experimental and conceptual art of the late 60s and 70s. He wistfully recalled the python-print flared corduroys he had in those days, and said, \"This stuff didn't have an audience then. Maybe six people other than the artists involved. No one knew what the rules were, or whether or not what they did was art. Nor did they know how to present it. Every student now knows the rules of presentation.\" </p> <p>John Stezaker, who is showing works derived from postcards of Westminster and Big Ben, describes it as \"the most repressed, anorexic art movement ever, with no appeal whatever to desire or to the unconscious\". When the Hayward mounted its exhibition The New Art in 1972, which included works by more than a dozen of the artists now at the Whitechapel, it was one of the worst attended in the gallery's history. But the Whitechapel has been full since the exhibition opened last Friday. The British public has largely overcome its disdain for modern art. </p> <p>So what was the experiment? What were the concepts? Preoccupations included time and duration, abjection and transience, dematerialisation and nothingness, process, social context and individualism, the self and its construction. All human life is here, except painting and sculpture, unless you count Bob Law's painting, which doesn't belong anyway, and Derek Boshier's tiny minimal sculptures, photographed out of scale in various locations. </p> <p>The New Art, or whatever it was (the curators don't seem especially clear on the matter, but then it was an epoch of uncertainty), was also art made in the shadows of Joseph Beuys, Yves Klein and Piero Manzoni, art influenced by anti-art and post-object artists in New York and California. Art derived from a varied and not always coherent mix of linguistics and structuralist thought, from Marx, Adorno, Walter Benjamin and Alain Robbe-Grillet, from feminism, behaviourism, drugs and dissidence. How all this concerted thinking worked its way into the photographs of Keith Arnatt, who stood outside the public library in Newport, Gwent, in his loon pants, carrying a placard with the words \"I'M A REAL ARTIST\", I don't know. Arnatt went on to make an exhibition proposal that read, \"Is it possible for me to do nothing as my contribution to this exhibition?\" Indeed it was. </p> <p>Craig-Martin's notorious 1973 philosophical self-interrogation about a glass of water on a shelf, which he said was an oak tree, belongs as much in the pages of Flann O'Brien as it does in the canon of post-Wittgensteinian thought. \"What I have done is change a glass of water into an oak tree without altering the accidents of the glass of water,\" Craig-Martin wrote. \"What accidents?\" he asked himself. \"Yes. The colour, feel, weight, size. How long will it continue to be an oak tree? UntiI I change it.\" Nothing has changed. Here's the glass, here's the oak tree, perhaps. </p> <p>The possibility that the work was simply absurd shouldn't be discounted, although humour was often inadvertent, dressed up as heavyweight thought. </p> <p>All this was very confusing for an art student. When Victor Burgin, whose work appears in this show, bounced into the studio at Trent Polytechnic in his Cuban heels and Marsha Hunt hairdo to lecture on the difference between Saussurian langue and parole, at least I was learning that books were to be read, if not always understood.</p> <p>John Latham, lecturing at St Martin's School of Art in the mid-60s, propagated the alternative notion that books were to be eaten. He invited a few students for an impromptu \"at home\" one Sunday, during which they were invited to tuck into the pages of critic Clement Greenberg's Art and Culture - grim fare, some might say, for starving students. Unfortunately, it was a library book, and Latham's attempt to return the masticated pulp got him the sack. I know that library, and the commemorative No Eating sign that to this day hangs on the door. You can't actually eat the regurgitated book at the Whitechapel, but you can look at its remains, along with all the relevant documentation, in a museum vitrine. </p> <p>Latham's gesture was in part an attack on the god-like status accorded Greenberg in the sculpture school at St Martin's, where Antony Caro and his traditional metal-bending chums ruled the roost. The dissident students under that macho regime - Gilbert and George, Bruce McLean and Richard Long (who'd previously been chucked out of art school in Bristol for absenting himself on long walks and traipsing mud through the nice clean studios) - went on to make work in direct resistance to the dominant school. </p> <p>One of the things the exhibition barely hints at is how antagonistic this world was. The artist-protagonists, who taught part-time up and down the country, forced students to take sides, but they alienated just as many. There were suicides. The intimidation tactics used by both the supposedly liberal colleges on the one hand, and the likes of the conceptual art group Art &amp; Language on the other, were astonishing in their crudity and destructiveness. Now the kind of mind-set and tactics we can observe in Live in Your Head have grown into academic orthodoxy. </p> <p>Art &amp; Language is here, with a series of filing cabinets you're not allowed to open, and reams of impenetrable typed codes stuck to the wall. Its spoof codifications hang alongside Susan Hiller's classified sets of collected postcards of rough seas around the British coast. The postcards are great, while Hiller's mind-numbing numbering of them now looks redundant. But Hiller was attempting to apply her training as an anthropologist to sociological ephemera, and her Rough Seas can now be read as a precursor to Tacita Dean's work. Even if we regard a lot of this as a necessarily flawed experiment, it did at least attempt new, if not exactly original, ways of working. </p> <p> An apparently more politicised art was going on at the same time, although most of it has lost its agit-prop power. A mistrust of aesthetic form (and formalism) led to some pretty arid, preachy-looking documentary art, even if the issues still have resonance. Looking at Rasheed Araeen's For Oluwale, which re-presents an article from the Guardian about a Nigerian immigrant, David Oluwale, who was hounded and tormented by Leeds police in 1971, and found dead in the River Aire, one is left with a terrible feeling that nothing changes.</p> <p>Conrad Atkinson's A Shade of Green, an Orange Edge collected quotations from everyone from Belfast children, then home secretary Reggie Maudling and Jonathan Swift, in a work focusing on Bloody Sunday. Atkinson's work was never any good, except as documentation. But Maudling's \"For god's sake bring me a large Scotch. What a bloody awful country\", juxtaposed with a child's \"Trouble everywhere, blood, everything turning wild, people like wild animals\", remains chilling. I guess the inclusion of John Dugger's banner, which hung behind Salvador Allende during a mass rally in support of Chilean resistance in Trafalgar Square in 1974, is included to give political perspective. Dugger now makes banners in California for corporate clients. </p> <p>But there are moments here which still have a certain power and endurance. Stuart Brisley's 1972-3 film Arbeit Macht Frei (\"Work makes you free\" - the words emblazoned over the gate at Auschwitz) is an utterly chilling sequence of performances filmed by Ken MacMullen and Anna Flanagan. The work, in which Brisley vomits, seems to drown under ice and floats in a pool of offal, is harrowing, fixating, distressing.</p> <p>It is also a formally beautiful work, in which his head, like a death mask, rises through bubbles and scum and the grainy flicker of disturbed sleep, ending in a scream. It owes more to Antonin Artaud than Austrian Aktionism. It provides an antidote to all the wanky stop-frame landscape films and photos, the studious polytechnic-speak of would-be art intellectuals, the innocent S&amp;M fun and games of Cosey Fanni Tutti and Genesis P-Orridge, of whom John Peel wrote: \"They're mad - but we need more of this kind of madness.\" We got more of it. In fact, we've had more of it than we can eat. Ah! Unhappy days, unhappy days. </p> <p>\u0095 Live in Your Head is at the Whitechapel Art Gallery, London E1 (0171-522 7878), till April 2.</p>",

An apparently more politicised art was going on at the same time, although most of it has lost its agit-prop power. A mistrust of aesthetic form (and formalism) led to some pretty arid, preachy-looking documentary art, even if the issues still have resonance. Looking at Rasheed Araeen's For Oluwale, which re-presents an article from the Guardian about a Nigerian immigrant, David Oluwale, who was hounded and tormented by Leeds police in 1971, and found dead in the River Aire, one is left with a terrible feeling that nothing changes. Conrad Atkinson's A Shade of Green, an Orange Edge collected quotations from everyone from Belfast children, then home secretary Reggie Maudling and Jonathan Swift, in a work focusing on Bloody Sunday. Atkinson's work was never any good, except as documentation. But Maudling's \"For god's sake bring me a large Scotch. What a bloody awful country\", juxtaposed with a child's \"Trouble everywhere, blood, everything turning wild, people like wild animals\", remains chilling. I guess the inclusion of John Dugger's banner, which hung behind Salvador Allende during a mass rally in support of Chilean resistance in Trafalgar Square in 1974, is included to give political perspective. Dugger now makes banners in California for corporate clients. But there are moments here which still have a certain power and endurance. Stuart Brisley's 1972-3 film Arbeit Macht Frei (\"Work makes you free\" - the words emblazoned over the gate at Auschwitz) is an utterly chilling sequence of performances filmed by Ken MacMullen and Anna Flanagan. The work, in which Brisley vomits, seems to drown under ice and floats in a pool of offal, is harrowing, fixating, distressing. It is also a formally beautiful work, in which his head, like a death mask, rises through bubbles and scum and the grainy flicker of disturbed sleep, ending in a scream. It owes more to Antonin Artaud than Austrian Aktionism. It provides an antidote to all the wanky stop-frame landscape films and photos, the studious polytechnic-speak of would-be art intellectuals, the innocent S&amp;M fun and games of Cosey Fanni Tutti and Genesis P-Orridge, of whom John Peel wrote: \"They're mad - but we need more of this kind of madness.\" We got more of it. In fact, we've had more of it than we can eat. Ah! Unhappy days, unhappy days. \u0095 Live in Your Head is at the Whitechapel Art Gallery, London E1 (0171-522 7878), till April 2.",

      "body": "<p>There isn't a phase of Stravinsky's endlessly protean development that has not spread its influence on succeeding generations of composers, for he dominated 20th-century music in a unique way.</p> <p>The works he composed in the 50s, when his style was shifting from neo-classicism to his very personal version of serial technique, have left their mark on history in a less conspicuous but no less significant way. It was a selection of small-scale works from that period, all written around the very different landmarks of The Rake's Progress and the ballet Agon, that provided the theme of the London Sinfonietta's triple-decker programme on Sunday.</p> <p>They were interleaved with works by three British composers, all of whom, in platform interviews with the Stravinsky biographer Stephen Walsh during the concert, declared a debt to Stravinsky of one kind or another. </p> <p>Knussen's continuing advocacy of this still difficult and unfamiliar music is remarkable. Though a work like the Septet, literally on the cusp of neo-classicism and serialism, responds to a standard Stravinskian approach, the Three Shakespeare Songs (intelligently sung here by Mary King) and the little memorial pieces like the Double Canon and the Epitaphium need a studied coolness and care to bring out their hard-edged qualities, which was what these Sinfonietta performances provided. </p> <p>As well as a revival of Geoffrey King-Gomez's Magritte Weather, there should have been two new British works, both Sinfonietta commissions, to set off this rather austere sequence. Knussen's own score was not completed in time; instead the Sinfonietta gave lustrous performances of his Ophelia Dances and the Two Organa. </p> <p>Julian Anderson's Alhambra Fantasy did materialise, and a remarkable score it turned out to be. Though it was apparently inspired by a visit to the Alhambra palace in Granada, and elements of Moorish and Sephardic music are woven into the score along with Spanish folk songs collected by Lorca, there's no trace of picture-postcard realism about Anderson's piece. It spits out ideas at a dizzyingly rapid pace in its first half, all vividly coloured and driven with irrepressible rhythmic energy, then slows dramatically and revisits the same material at a more leisurely pace. The structure may not quite work - the idea of a highly compressed series of variations followed by a single lengthier one is perhaps more intellectually than aurally satisfying, and the piece runs out of steam a little towards the end - but there is so much that is startling and immediate about the writing that such nit-picking seems beside the point.</p>",

The works he composed in the 50s, when his style was shifting from neo-classicism to his very personal version of serial technique, have left their mark on history in a less conspicuous but no less significant way. It was a selection of small-scale works from that period, all written around the very different landmarks of The Rake's Progress and the ballet Agon, that provided the theme of the London Sinfonietta's triple-decker programme on Sunday. They were interleaved with works by three British composers, all of whom, in platform interviews with the Stravinsky biographer Stephen Walsh during the concert, declared a debt to Stravinsky of one kind or another. Knussen's continuing advocacy of this still difficult and unfamiliar music is remarkable. Though a work like the Septet, literally on the cusp of neo-classicism and serialism, responds to a standard Stravinskian approach, the Three Shakespeare Songs (intelligently sung here by Mary King) and the little memorial pieces like the Double Canon and the Epitaphium need a studied coolness and care to bring out their hard-edged qualities, which was what these Sinfonietta performances provided. As well as a revival of Geoffrey King-Gomez's Magritte Weather, there should have been two new British works, both Sinfonietta commissions, to set off this rather austere sequence. Knussen's own score was not completed in time; instead the Sinfonietta gave lustrous performances of his Ophelia Dances and the Two Organa. Julian Anderson's Alhambra Fantasy did materialise, and a remarkable score it turned out to be. Though it was apparently inspired by a visit to the Alhambra palace in Granada, and elements of Moorish and Sephardic music are woven into the score along with Spanish folk songs collected by Lorca, there's no trace of picture-postcard realism about Anderson's piece. It spits out ideas at a dizzyingly rapid pace in its first half, all vividly coloured and driven with irrepressible rhythmic energy, then slows dramatically and revisits the same material at a more leisurely pace. The structure may not quite work - the idea of a highly compressed series of variations followed by a single lengthier one is perhaps more intellectually than aurally satisfying, and the piece runs out of steam a little towards the end - but there is so much that is startling and immediate about the writing that such nit-picking seems beside the point.",

      "body": "<p>A lot of casual punters tune out of traditional jazz piano trios before they've had a chance to deliver their message. Broadway tunes, unfolded with understated swing and propelled by tasteful rhythm sections, often say \"warm-up band\" to irregular listeners, who are waiting for the main attraction to blast them out of their seat with a sax. </p> <p>David Newton, the Scottish pianist who was launching his new CD Halfway to Dawn, has had to carry this baggage around for a lot longer than his classy accomplishments deserve. He has proved such a superb accompanist (of singers, particularly) that he has been almost sidelined into that role. Meanwhile, Newton's affections for traditional thematic development, familiar song structures and the sometimes treacherous waters of the mainstream have maybe encouraged lazy listening to his achievements as both player and composer. But he repays close attention, particularly here. </p> <p>Newton's idea of an acoustic piano trio is nowhere near as loose, impressionistic and open-ended as Keith Jarrett's has been, or Brad Mehldau's, or Bobo Stenson's - and his forthright song-based lyricism doesn't generally catch the charismatic mysteriousness all three can bring to a room. But his current trio with bassist Matt Miles and drummer Steve Brown is a little gem of group empathy in pursuit of straight-ahead swing. </p> <p>From the off, when Newton introduced Bright New Day with offhand chords over Miles's bass vamp, the pianist's storytelling skills were evident, the casual theme building into a soft roar of insistent trills, punchy chordwork and sudden sprinting runs.

      "bodyText": "A lot of casual punters tune out of traditional jazz piano trios before they've had a chance to deliver their message. Broadway tunes, unfolded with understated swing and propelled by tasteful rhythm sections, often say \"warm-up band\" to irregular listeners, who are waiting for the main attraction to blast them out of their seat with a sax. David Newton, the Scottish pianist who was launching his new CD Halfway to Dawn, has had to carry this baggage around for a lot longer than his classy accomplishments deserve. He has proved such a superb accompanist (of singers, particularly) that he has been almost sidelined into that role. Meanwhile, Newton's affections for traditional thematic development, familiar song structures and the sometimes treacherous waters of the mainstream have maybe encouraged lazy listening to his achievements as both player and composer. But he repays close attention, particularly here. Newton's idea of an acoustic piano trio is nowhere near as loose, impressionistic and open-ended as Keith Jarrett's has been, or Brad Mehldau's, or Bobo Stenson's - and his forthright song-based lyricism doesn't generally catch the charismatic mysteriousness all three can bring to a room. But his current trio with bassist Matt Miles and drummer Steve Brown is a little gem of group empathy in pursuit of straight-ahead swing. From the off, when Newton introduced Bright New Day with offhand chords over Miles's bass vamp, the pianist's storytelling skills were evident, the casual theme building into a soft roar of insistent trills, punchy chordwork and sudden sprinting runs. Newton also made a shapely narrative out of the obliquely funky ballad Wishful Thinking, phrasing in half-stated figures as if nervous of damaging the keys. On drums, Brown (a tall, hawk-nosed young man with an eager grin, who sits at a low-slung kit with the cymbals set at elbow-level) is a delight. He has an urbane understatement and sidelong wit that adds zip and buoyancy to the sounds around him. Alert to every approaching detail, he fills out melodies with hissing hi-hat snaps and briefly jolting rolls, drops back to minimalist rimshots and erupts into fizzing cymbal swing with an effect like a door suddenly swung open to a busy street.

Five months have gone by since I first asked about this during which time I have supplied the information asked for (in October) and waited for an amount of time I feel is excessive considering that I am asking for a rise in the region of about \u00a32-4K per annum (although I did not specify this amount, it would bring my wage in line with other similar jobs that I outlined to my boss). </p> <p>I also now feel aggrieved that I do not know what is going on, and there is no sign of a resolution to this.

You have done everything right and obviously have the insight and analytical skills to figure out what their problem is. In other words, you sound like a real asset to the company, but your managers can't see beyond their own prejudices to recognise this.</p> <p>This leaves you with three options. Firstly, you can swallow your feelings of being undervalued and ignore the whole thing in exchange for the part-time job you want (if not at the salary you want). Secondly, you can give up and simply look for alternative employment. Finally, you could go above your boss and take the matter higher - with the associated risks that you identify.</p> <p>My advice? I would try options two and three simultaneously. Start looking for alternative employment but at the same time, take the matter higher.

End by sweetly suggesting that as your boss clearly does not have the time to give the matter consideration and you do not wish to keep pestering them for an answer, you feel that it would be better to take the matter to a more senior level. In other words, provide your boss with a reasonable explanation for his/her lack of action that can justify your going above him/her. Such a letter may in itself, galvanise your boss into activity.</p> <p>Incidentally, I don't think that your employers are hoping you will leave - I just don't think it has crossed their minds that you might consider leaving. If you did, I suspect it would be a huge shock that might well jolt them into giving you an appropriate salary increase.
