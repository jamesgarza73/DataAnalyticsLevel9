      "body": "<p>Are you one of those people who would hyperventilate if your office chair went missing? Would you hunt down and publicly humiliate the culprit who failed to return your stapler to the right drawer? Or perhaps you avoid the cracks in the pavement on your walk to work. Don't worry, you are not alone. A study by recruitment consultants Office Angels has revealed that there are a lot of you about. British office workers, it seems, are creatures of habit who seek comfort in daily rituals in the workplace. </p> <p>The survey of 1,500 office employees and employers found that 49% of workers always use the same toilet cubicle at work, even if it means waiting for it to become vacant. Thirty-eight per cent will drink only out of their favourite mug. </p> <p>A staggering 74% paint their name on office belongings such as rulers and staplers as a way of marking their territory. Not in blood thankfully, just in Tipp-Ex, in capital letters, with exclamation marks to imply they are only joking about their possessive tendencies, when we all know they're deadly serious. </p> <p>So why do they do it? \"People tend to impose these workplace rituals on themselves as a way of gaining control over situations, or to help them feel more 'at home' and able to cope with daily stresses and strains,\" says Paul Jacobs, director of corporate communication at Office Angels. More than three-quarters of the respondents said that these rituals had a positive impact on their morale. Without their habits, presumably, they would all be gibbering wrecks. </p> <p>One of the biggest problems with rituals is that people often forget they are performing them - such is the nature of habit. A good idea would be to make a log of your idiosyncracies and then make every effort to alter some of them. Check if your habits match any of those revealed by the survey. Sixty-nine per cent of interviewees admitted that they stand in the same place on the platform each morning on their way to work and find themselves making a dash for the same seat on the train. (Oh dear.) Fifty-six per cent admit they typically check where their name is in the pecking order on an email or memo address. (Low self-esteem no doubt.) Seventy-four per cent reward themselves for completing their least favourite tasks. (There's nothing like an incentive to get the job done.) </p> <p>\"Thinking about it I've realised that I always buy a cup of tea on the way to work. I have a routine of putting my handbag under my table, hanging my coat up, draping my scarf over the back of my chair, just in case I get cold in the day. Oh, and I always have to have a packet of crisps, an apple, some sugar and some serviettes stashed in my draw. If I don't have a store of food I get a bit twitchy,\" confesses one office worker. </p> <p>Jacobs claims that the force of habit is so ingrained in people that given extra freedom some office workers become nervous and anxious. Dress down Fridays, when certain companies relax the dress code at work, causes all sorts of problems. \"Workers become very self-conscious about what they should and shouldn't wear. For most, wearing a suit is the easiest and safest option,\" says Jacobs. British workers it would seem really do need to chill out and get themselves a life. </p> <p>Stephen Bevan, associate director of the Institute for Employment Studies, says: \"More and more people are expected to use their time efficiently at work. As a result, they derive comfort from habit. It helps them collect their thoughts. It sets them up for the day. With so much change and uncertainty in the workplace, many workers use routine as the backbone of the day. It's something they can anchor onto - a way of staking out a patch of territory to help them feel secure.\" </p> <p>Bevan also points out that rituals are more important to certain personalities than others. Some people, he says, feel they are in control of their destiny and are likely to push for their own career development. \"They tend to have little time for superstition or ritual - they feel they determine their own fate. They are the types who roll with the punches and are most likely to leave a job if they are dissatisfied.\" </p> <p>Then there are the ones who cling to ritual. \"They believe that things are outside their control. They plod on at work in the hope that their employer will reward them when necessary, but they are not going to scream and shout for it. They tend to be the ones who seek comfort in small things,\" says Bevan. </p> <p>Rituals are one thing, but superstition is quite another. Working with people who are superstitious means, in essence, that you are sharing an office with people who are irrational. Twenty-four per cent of respondents believed that they would be plagued by bad luck without their rituals and 46% felt that their moods would be dampened, or their concentration severely affected if they did not carry out their routines. Alarming stuff. </p> <p>\"Rituals are a psychological comfort blanket - humans like stability. With longer working hours and increased workloads, the animal part of us craves some personal territory. Although I understand it, I don't think it should be encouraged,\" says Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology and health at University of Manchester's Institute of Science and Technology. </p> <p>Cooper argues that if a healthy work/life balance is to be achieved by the British workforce, workers need to be more flexible. \"We need more people willing to take on change rather than have everyone driving on the M25 to work everyday. We need parents to be able to work from home. Two out of three families are working families with both adults working - things are not healthy for those who want to spend time with their children. The last thing you want is people to be getting tied up in petty rituals in the office.\" </p> <p>Paul Jacobs also offers a warning. \"We should all make sure we do not become too preoccupied by routine. This will ensure our habits do not turn from being productive to time-wasting distractions.\"</p>",

The survey of 1,500 office employees and employers found that 49% of workers always use the same toilet cubicle at work, even if it means waiting for it to become vacant. Thirty-eight per cent will drink only out of their favourite mug. A staggering 74% paint their name on office belongings such as rulers and staplers as a way of marking their territory. Not in blood thankfully, just in Tipp-Ex, in capital letters, with exclamation marks to imply they are only joking about their possessive tendencies, when we all know they're deadly serious. So why do they do it? \"People tend to impose these workplace rituals on themselves as a way of gaining control over situations, or to help them feel more 'at home' and able to cope with daily stresses and strains,\" says Paul Jacobs, director of corporate communication at Office Angels. More than three-quarters of the respondents said that these rituals had a positive impact on their morale. Without their habits, presumably, they would all be gibbering wrecks. One of the biggest problems with rituals is that people often forget they are performing them - such is the nature of habit. A good idea would be to make a log of your idiosyncracies and then make every effort to alter some of them. Check if your habits match any of those revealed by the survey. Sixty-nine per cent of interviewees admitted that they stand in the same place on the platform each morning on their way to work and find themselves making a dash for the same seat on the train. (Oh dear.) Fifty-six per cent admit they typically check where their name is in the pecking order on an email or memo address. (Low self-esteem no doubt.) Seventy-four per cent reward themselves for completing their least favourite tasks. (There's nothing like an incentive to get the job done.) \"Thinking about it I've realised that I always buy a cup of tea on the way to work. I have a routine of putting my handbag under my table, hanging my coat up, draping my scarf over the back of my chair, just in case I get cold in the day. Oh, and I always have to have a packet of crisps, an apple, some sugar and some serviettes stashed in my draw. If I don't have a store of food I get a bit twitchy,\" confesses one office worker. Jacobs claims that the force of habit is so ingrained in people that given extra freedom some office workers become nervous and anxious. Dress down Fridays, when certain companies relax the dress code at work, causes all sorts of problems. \"Workers become very self-conscious about what they should and shouldn't wear. For most, wearing a suit is the easiest and safest option,\" says Jacobs. British workers it would seem really do need to chill out and get themselves a life. Stephen Bevan, associate director of the Institute for Employment Studies, says: \"More and more people are expected to use their time efficiently at work. As a result, they derive comfort from habit. It helps them collect their thoughts. It sets them up for the day. With so much change and uncertainty in the workplace, many workers use routine as the backbone of the day. It's something they can anchor onto - a way of staking out a patch of territory to help them feel secure.\" Bevan also points out that rituals are more important to certain personalities than others. Some people, he says, feel they are in control of their destiny and are likely to push for their own career development. \"They tend to have little time for superstition or ritual - they feel they determine their own fate. They are the types who roll with the punches and are most likely to leave a job if they are dissatisfied.\" Then there are the ones who cling to ritual. \"They believe that things are outside their control. They plod on at work in the hope that their employer will reward them when necessary, but they are not going to scream and shout for it. They tend to be the ones who seek comfort in small things,\" says Bevan. Rituals are one thing, but superstition is quite another. Working with people who are superstitious means, in essence, that you are sharing an office with people who are irrational. Twenty-four per cent of respondents believed that they would be plagued by bad luck without their rituals and 46% felt that their moods would be dampened, or their concentration severely affected if they did not carry out their routines. Alarming stuff. \"Rituals are a psychological comfort blanket - humans like stability. With longer working hours and increased workloads, the animal part of us craves some personal territory. Although I understand it, I don't think it should be encouraged,\" says Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology and health at University of Manchester's Institute of Science and Technology. Cooper argues that if a healthy work/life balance is to be achieved by the British workforce, workers need to be more flexible. \"We need more people willing to take on change rather than have everyone driving on the M25 to work everyday. We need parents to be able to work from home. Two out of three families are working families with both adults working - things are not healthy for those who want to spend time with their children. The last thing you want is people to be getting tied up in petty rituals in the office.\" Paul Jacobs also offers a warning. \"We should all make sure we do not become too preoccupied by routine. This will ensure our habits do not turn from being productive to time-wasting distractions.\"",

I didn't think I'd ever be my own boss, but times change.\" </p> <p>In fact, during Chamberlain's career break, time changed things so much that she could barely recognise the technology on her return. When she left her last job, she was still using a typewriter. \"There was just one computer in the office,\" she says. \"I remember going to look at it, marvelling at the mouse and wondering if I would ever have to use one.\" </p> <p>She did, of course. In her time away, the computer became a necessity and, once Chamberlain had refreshed herself, she asked around to see if anyone needed any secretarial duties dealt with. They did, and she has now established a business working from home. </p> <p>As daunting as making a comeback sounds, it is becoming increasingly common. Children, stress, early retirement or simply a desire for a long, leisurely break often takes a chunk out of the career path. It may be a long, windy road back but, as secretarial agencies are increasingly ready to testify, it's never too late to start again. </p> <p>\"If you gave up work some years ago and have now decided to return, you'll find that the way we're working is very different,\" says Amanda Bedford, from the Institute of Qualified Private Secretaries. \"What you'll notice most is how skills have changed. The technological demands are huge.\" </p> <p>Every office now has computers, email is more common than faxes and, in the past year or two, the internet has taken off immeasurably, particularly as a reference tool. </p> <p>The secretarial role has changed. \"Many top PAs don't sit and type any more. They go to meetings and join in projects. The job has become more responsible and pro-active. They'll be booking conferences on the net, sending emails, juggling different skills. I would recommend any returner to go on a course to update skills and to try not to be scared by how fast-moving the office environment has become.\" </p> <p>Karen Dorling was a PA in a bank for 11 years before leaving to bring up her son.\"I was very worried about going back to work,\" she says. \"I had lost confidence by being away so long and found that it wasn't at all how I remembered. You could achieve something so much more quickly than you could before.\" </p> <p>After six months of temping, Karen, from Stanford-le-Hope in Essex, took a permanent job, as PA to Sandra Hitching, director of human resources for Kelly Services. She says she was encouraged by Hitching's attitude to her. \"What was difficult about returning to work was rebuilding my confidence,\" she says. \"Suddenly I was working and I was a mother - a situation I hadn't experienced before - and I discovered that some people didn't appreciate it. They felt I didn't have the ability to be a good PA because I was a mother, but Sandra never questioned my devotion to the job.\" </p> <p>Hitching says that juggling home and family gives someone organisational and multi-tasking attributes that can be transferred to the workplace. \"Not everyone thinks that, because some people are blinkered,\" she says. \"They won't look at someone if they're below or above a certain age and they worry about people being rusty if they've been away a long time. But basic competencies aren't eroded by time. You have to come back, acquire the technical skills and market yourself the right way.\" </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Hitching recommends making a start with an agency. \"They can help because they're specialists,\" she says. \"Software develops every 18 months so even if you left the workplace a year ago, you'd see slight changes.

Agencies can teach you the right programs to make yourself marketable.\" </p> <p>Rachael Chamberlain (no relation to Susan) ignored the doom-mongers and left her job to go abroad and teach English for a year. </p> <p>\"I gave up my job to join my fiance in Poland,\" says Rachael. \"It was quite daunting at first as I chose to do something completely unlike anything I'd ever done, but it was fantastic to do something so different.\" </p> <p>She says she would recommend travelling to anyone, but admits that when she returned to the UK she found it difficult to get back into an office routine. \"In Poland I'd never worked 9am to 5pm,\" she says. \"I'd worked really unusual hours, such as 8am to 10am and then 6pm to 10pm, with lots of breaks for shopping in-between. The longer you're away, the harder it must be to get back into a routine.\" </p> <p>She chose to temp and was soon offered a permanent job. This month she joins Kraft Foods in Cheltenham as part of its administrative team for customer marketing. \"Going travelling certainly didn't harm my career,\" says Rachael. \"Because I'd worked for a long time before, it didn't look as if I was lazy, and anyway I was working in Poland.

Chandeliers, grand pianos and banqueting tables all dangle languidly from the midnight sky. Only Henrick has neglected to attach his rope to anything and tumbles back to earth. </p> <p>Jody Crosier's splenetic portrayal of this suicidal student is just one of the many tragi-comic delights that Kerryson teases from this glittering group portrait of the early 20th-century Swedish demi-monde at play.

      "bodyText": "Poor Henrick has problems hanging himself - which is actually quite a feat in Paul Kerryson's spectral, moon-washed production of Sondheim's masterpiece, in which everything is held in a state of magical suspension. Chandeliers, grand pianos and banqueting tables all dangle languidly from the midnight sky. Only Henrick has neglected to attach his rope to anything and tumbles back to earth. Jody Crosier's splenetic portrayal of this suicidal student is just one of the many tragi-comic delights that Kerryson teases from this glittering group portrait of the early 20th-century Swedish demi-monde at play.

But on his only UK date at the Barbican on Saturday, Rollins eschewed only one virtuosic spectacle of old - the unbroken, lung-punishing circular-breathing exercises that fuelled chorus after chorus of improvisation without intake of breath. Everything else was there - the bone-shaking low notes, the slewing momentum intermingling abstract playing with his familiar rugged, ironic lyricism and affection for cut-and-paste quotation - and, of course, the insistence that the improvising is the point.

But his squirty, impulsive phrasing, braying wails, sonorous low-register rumbles and preoccupied passages were appearing by the arrival of In a Sentimental Mood.

      "body": "<p>Gordon Brown yesterday delivered a calculated rebuff to the European Central Bank when he announced in the most public way possible that Britain's inflation target would remain unchanged in order to safeguard jobs and growth. </p> <p>Rejecting calls that he should cut the inflation target from 2.5% and bring it into line with the 2% ceiling in the single-currency zone, the chancellor underlined his concern over the ECB's structure and conduct by continuing with a go-it-alone approach. </p> <p>The decision was announced in Washington in Mr Brown's keynote speech to the International Monetary Fund's international monetary and financial committee, attended by 24 finance ministers, and comes at a time when the ECB is coming under increasing pressure to join other central banks in cutting interest rates. </p> <p>\"At this time of global risks, we need to continue to steer a course of stability,\" Mr Brown said. </p> <p>\"That demands consistency and clarity in macroeconomic policy. With inflation forecast to be 2.5% next year, imposing a lower inflation target - as some have suggested - would mean upward pressure on interest rates and risk lower growth and higher unemployment. So I have decided to reaffirm the inflation target at 2.5% for the coming year and have today written to the governor of the Bank of England [Sir Eddie George] to set out the monetary policy committee's remit for the coming year.\" </p> <p>One of Britain's leading economic think tanks, the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, will today call for Britain to adopt a 2% inflation target as the first step towards joining monetary union. It says reducing the target to 2% will help ensure lower interest rates and facilitate\"the process of convergence with the European monetary union.\" </p> <p>Mr Brown believes that Britain's system is preferable to that used by the ECB, however, since the 2.5% target for the Bank of England is symmetrical, with an inflation rate below the target treated just as seriously as an inflation rate above the target. The ECB's mandate is to keep inflation at 2% or below, an approach that the chancellor believes exacerbates the ECB's deflationary bias. </p> <p>Treasury officials said that remarks made by the French finance minister, Laurent Fabius, showed that Mr Brown's doubts about the ECB were shared by his colleagues in Europe and stressed that the decision to leave the inflation target unchanged had no bearing on whether the government would hold an early referendum on joining the euro. </p> <p>In the light of the chancellor's leading role in any decision to call a referendum, both supporters and opponents of UK membership are likely to see his decision as having a wider significance. </p> <p>In its quarterly report, the institute admits the prospect of Britain joining the single currency is less likely than it has been for a \"considerable time\". </p> <p>Mr Fabius yesterday added to the calls for the ECB to change course on interest rates. </p> <p>\"We have had the distinct feeling, over the last few weeks, that the balance of risk has altered, influenced by the global slowdown. Inflationary pressures are under control,\" Mr Fabius said in his IMF speech. </p> <p>\"Our central financial objective is to balance public finances in the next three years: it would be paradoxical to see this compromised by a growth slowdown. Our monetary stance will have to take these elements into account.\" </p> <p>Wim Duisenberg, head of the European Central Bank, made it clear in Washington that the bank prided itself on its independence, and - with inflation likely to above 2% until early next year - would not be bounced into a rate cut.</p>",

So I have decided to reaffirm the inflation target at 2.5% for the coming year and have today written to the governor of the Bank of England [Sir Eddie George] to set out the monetary policy committee's remit for the coming year.\" One of Britain's leading economic think tanks, the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, will today call for Britain to adopt a 2% inflation target as the first step towards joining monetary union. It says reducing the target to 2% will help ensure lower interest rates and facilitate\"the process of convergence with the European monetary union.\" Mr Brown believes that Britain's system is preferable to that used by the ECB, however, since the 2.5% target for the Bank of England is symmetrical, with an inflation rate below the target treated just as seriously as an inflation rate above the target. The ECB's mandate is to keep inflation at 2% or below, an approach that the chancellor believes exacerbates the ECB's deflationary bias. Treasury officials said that remarks made by the French finance minister, Laurent Fabius, showed that Mr Brown's doubts about the ECB were shared by his colleagues in Europe and stressed that the decision to leave the inflation target unchanged had no bearing on whether the government would hold an early referendum on joining the euro. In the light of the chancellor's leading role in any decision to call a referendum, both supporters and opponents of UK membership are likely to see his decision as having a wider significance. In its quarterly report, the institute admits the prospect of Britain joining the single currency is less likely than it has been for a \"considerable time\". Mr Fabius yesterday added to the calls for the ECB to change course on interest rates. \"We have had the distinct feeling, over the last few weeks, that the balance of risk has altered, influenced by the global slowdown. Inflationary pressures are under control,\" Mr Fabius said in his IMF speech. \"Our central financial objective is to balance public finances in the next three years: it would be paradoxical to see this compromised by a growth slowdown. Our monetary stance will have to take these elements into account.\" Wim Duisenberg, head of the European Central Bank, made it clear in Washington that the bank prided itself on its independence, and - with inflation likely to above 2% until early next year - would not be bounced into a rate cut.",

Women living along the coast downstream from Oldbury are 50 per cent more likely to die of breast cancer than those living more than three miles inland. The chance of this being random is one in 50,000. In Gordano, downstream from Oldbury, men are 80 per cent more likely to die of cancer than elsewhere, and women 40 per cent. The work was commissioned by Michael Holmes, an Independent MEP for the South West, who works in co-operation with the Green Party. Holmes said: 'If the possibility of cancers is related to living near a nuclear power station, they should be closed down.' Leukaemia clusters were first discovered around Sellafield nuclear processing plant in 1983, and have now become widely accepted by cancer epidemiologists. However, there is no consensus on whether they are caused by radiation. BNFL, which runs Oldbury, insisted that the levels of radiation emitted there are far too low to cause cancer. A spokesman dismissed Busby's findings: 'He comes up with these things virtually every week. Every time he comes out with a report it is rubbished by people.'",

      "body": "<p>It's the opening night party for Stones in his Pockets on Broadway, the sort of Cinderella story on which the theatre thrives - small-scale Belfast play makes it all the way to the Big Apple. But while celebrants toast the show's visiting Irishmen, Conleth Hill and Sean Campion, the real excitement is about a homegrown American musical that is playing on 44th Street, one block over from Stones. </p> <p>'Have you seen The Producers yet?' says Frank Skinner, who is in town for the weekend with his girlfriend, Caroline. 'It's incredible.' </p> <p>'Just amazing - uh-may-zeeng,' says a senior London producer, looking disappointed to know that the UK rights to the show seem more or less sewn up. </p> <p>'It's going to be mega,' says a well-placed New York Times journalist rarely given to hyperbole. </p> <p>And all that buzz with 11 nights still to go until the formal opening of Mel Brooks's musical. </p> <p> The Producers opened on 19 April. Adapted by Brooks from his 1968 film, with songs specially written for the stage by him, it is directed and choreographed by Susan Stroman, whose late husband, English director Mike Ockrent, was originally intended to stage the show. By this time next year, Stroman should have an astonishing five productions running concurrently on Broadway, including the New York transfer of the National Theatre's Oklahoma! , for which Stroman did the dances. The stars are two previous Tony-winners who are much loved in New York: Matthew Broderick, now on screen in You Can Count On Me, and Nathan Lane, whose credits include Guys and Dolls and No\u00ebl Coward on Broadway. </p> <p> The Producers isn't just a hit; it's a fully-fledged event in a city that thrives on such things, and its cultural repercussions look sure to be felt in English-speaking theatre the world over, although given its subject matter, the show seems an unlikely export to Germany. </p> <p>The plot in the main follows that of Brooks's movie, in which Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder played two New York nogoodniks, Bialystock and Bloom, who deliberately conceive the worst musical ever, Springtime For Hitler, with the aim of absconding with their backers' dosh. Instead, their would-be flop is a hit, even with Hitler played by a drug-addled hippie called LSD (that character has been droped from the stage version as doubtlessly just too 1960s for today). Brooks won an Academy Award for his screenplay. </p> <p>But the road from celluloid to the stage isn't necessarily a smooth one - look at the West End's ever-evolving The Witches of Eastwick, which opened last summer in London to decidedly mixed reviews. What's more, in these obsessively PC times, you would have to possess a combination of hubris and devil-may-care glee to think about staging a show that sends up Nazis, blacks, Jews, gays - hell, even little old ladies - with equal abandon, as The Producers so merrily does. That person exists in Mel Brooks, 75 this year. Here is someone people thought was in the twilight of his film career now embarking upon an altogether new one: the theatre. </p> <p>'The long-ago dream of the nine-year-old Brooklyn boy has at last come true,' Brooks wrote in the New York Times before the show's opening. 'I hope for the best, expect the worst.' And yet, even he could not have realised to what extent his dream would end up being the one so evidently shared by New York audiences and critics, desperate for a real musical with singing and dancing and laughs after decades of through-sung (and mostly Britain-originated) pop operas and Sondheimian angst. </p> <p>'Oh, boy!' exulted John Heilpern in the New York Observer. 'When things go right! Mel Brooks's The Producers is quite simply the best time you could ever wish for at the theatre.' Over at the New York Times , Ben Brantley offered up the sort of encomium he traditionally reserves for visiting British imports like Skylight, Janet McTeer in A Doll's House or New York's current Mnemonic . 'How do you single out highlights in a bonfire?' ran Brantley's opening sentence. 'Everybody who sees The Producers - and that should be as close to everybody as the St James Theatre allows - is going to be hard-pressed to choose one favourite bit from the sublimely ridiculous spectacle.' </p> <p>Certainly, the packed Sunday-matin\u00e9e crowd with whom I watched the show cheered so heartily that it gave pause for thought. True, the Broadway musical has always feasted on shows about showbiz, from Kiss Me, Kate through to Gypsy, A Chorus Line and 42nd Street (a lavish twentieth-anniversary Broadway revival of which opens on Wednesday). But what does it say about American society when a piece featuring dancing jackboots and tapping zimmer frames (one of Stroman's more inspired touches) is received so rapturously? </p> <p>'I really felt what people must have felt at the opening of My Fair Lady,' says the Broadway producer Carole Shorenstein Hays, who attended a Producers first night more reminiscent of a Hollywood than a Broadway opening. Consider the guest list: Demi Moore, Alec Baldwin, Glenn Close, Sex and the City's Sarah Jessica Parker (who happens to be Producers co-star Matthew Broderick's wife). For once, however, the celebrities weren't the story; the show itself was. Here is a love letter from Broadway to itself, told with the sort of theatrical nous and panache that doesn't exist any more. </p> <p>It is also, of course, a distinctly American show - take that, Lord Lloyd-Webber and Sir Cameron!, or so one gleaned from the subtext of the reviews - as well as the work of a team of individuals, not the latest corporate concoction from Disney. (According to a report this week in the New York Post, Stroman alone could earn as much as \u00a325,000 a week for her work on the show.) The New York theatre has long felt ambivalent about hosting one visiting British behemoth after another (last year's closing on Broadway of Cats was greeted with relief rather than regret), not to mention utterly impotent in the face of the Disney machine, notwithstanding its respect for The Lion King 's visionary director, Julie Taymor. </p> <p>As for sondheim, Broadway holds its leading composer dear while simultaneously acknowledging that he caters to a rarefied market. In any case, his only real commercial hit, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, was first seen almost 40 years ago, and exists in the raucous musical comedy tradition that The Producers carries forward (and that Sondheim's subsequent career has virtually ignored). Prior to The Producers, the Broadway season's most anticipated opening was the first-ever New York revival of Sondheim's 1971 Follies. </p> <p>But it may not just be the problematic nature of Matthew Warchus's bare-bones staging that has seen Follies fully eclipsed by The Producers. (The latter show even includes the earlier one in its roll call of Broadway pastiche, which includes Fiddler on the Roof, Cabaret and, in a delicious visual gag, Cats .) As Michael Feingold put it in the Village Voice: 'After decades of musical-theatre pundits declaring that musicals have to be solemn, unpleasant and good for you, The Producers represents a recoil so extreme that the aesthetic pendulum seems to have jammed at the other end.' </p> <p>Not that such cavils will matter much to audiences. Ticketbuyers have been snaking around the block, a rare sight these days in New York, where most such transactions take place over the phone, with demand so intense the day after opening that two neighbouring (and rival) Broadway theatres opened their box offices to accommodate the overspill. At present, the show looks set to recoup production costs totalling some \u00a37.5 million ($10.5m) within 35 weeks, with advance sales up to \u00a312.5m ($20m) and the top ticket a hefty $100, or \u00a365. </p> <p>That last manoeuvre, cannily announced the morning after the opening so that it wouldn't feature in the critics' remarks, isn't a Broadway first: Nicholas Nickleby; Kevin Spacey in The Iceman Cometh ; and, for a while, even Miss Saigon charged the same, while many other Broadway shows, including Cabaret and Follies, are only $10 cheaper, as The Producers was at the start. But it's the first time that an open-ended run of a show has ever given over so much of an auditorium to such a pricey ticket, with some of Broadway's more hysteria-prone habitu\u00e9s arguing further that the producers of The Producers should open a second company of the same show in Manhattan to meet demand. </p> <p>Indeed, despite talk of The Producers displacing The Lion King and running for decades, you wonder what it will be like several casts on, once the comic tornado that is Lane's Max Bialystock has left the show and, with him, Broderick's quaveringly sung but likeable Leopold Bloom, the accountant blessed with Astaire-like terpsichorean gifts. (Nor ought one to overlook a supporting ensemble sporting such ripe theatre talents - and New York stage regulars - as Roger Bart, Gary Beach and, playing Bloom's Swedish love interest with the unpronounceable name, Cady Huffman, a singer with legs as long as the Empire State Building.) </p> <p>For one thing, Lane has a number, 'Betrayed', which recaps the entire show, and it comes so tailormade to his outsized talents that one feels Broadway history being born, as it once regularly was in the same vanished era of Ethel Merman and, yes, Mostel, to whom The Producers pays homage. </p> <p>London will surely get the show - some are saying as early as next March, possibly at the Dominion - but that's to wrench a particular urban phenomenon out of its very specific context. Ideally, The Producers should be seen in the same New York that Bialystock sings plaintively of once having ruled: 'I used to be the king/ the king of old Broadway,' he laments in one of the 17 fresh numbers that composer-lyricist Brooks has provided for his show.

      "bodyText": "The departure of Trevor Nunn from the National Theatre is a perfectly appropriate moment at which to reconsider the purpose and value of the organisation, but Susannah Clapp's analysis of what needs to be done is deeply unhelpful (The Observer, 22 AprilSusannah Clapp: It's time for the National to be shaken up - and stirred). Her simple, all-purpose solution, the same one that is always wearily trotted out - get the unquestionably charismatic Stephen Daldry - ignores the question of what the place is for. Her litany of shortcomings - why did David Hare do Via Dolorosa at the Royal Court and not at the NT? Why doesn't it do more physical theatre? Why doesn't it do more new plays? Why doesn't it do more non-plays? - absurdly proposes that the National should excel at every form of theatre, be all things to all theatregoers.

      "body": "<p>I have been in love with steam trains for as long as I can remember. I have railways in my blood. I come from a railway town, my uncle and grandfather were employed at the now-defunct carriage works in my old home town of York. I was brought up in a house beside the York to Scarborough line and spent many a happy hour of my childhood waving to the train drivers.</p> <p>I also have vivid childhood memories of visiting the small museum that closed to make way for the National Railway Museum in York. In those days, you could climb into the locomotive cabs and touch all those polished brass dials and levers. (And a note to all those men who always tell me that my obsession with trains is a phallic thing: do they honestly think their rather unattractive genitals bear any relation to a 102-ton steel locomotive? I think not.)</p> <p>My greatest wish has always been to ride on the footplate of a Class A-4 Pacific locomotive, the most magnificent thing ever to come out of an engineering shed. The A-4 Pacific was Britain's very own streamliner, an art-deco 'racehorse' introduced in 1935, just in time for George V's silver jubilee. The A-4s were designed by Sir Nigel Gresley - probably the greatest locomotive engineer the world has ever seen.</p> <p>In the thirties, the goal of steam was speed and a Doncaster-built A-4 called the Mallard provided it by hurtling through the Lincolnshire countryside at 126mph to became the fastest steam locomotive in the world.</p> <p>At the time, it must have seemed as though this was only the latest achievement in a race that would go on forever - that better, faster engines would come along and overtake the Mallard's achievement. History, however, knows better and the Mallard now holds the record for steam 'for all time', a poignant phrase on a par with 'the line ended in daughters'.</p> <p>Falcon, Wild Swan, Kingfisher, Merlin, Silver Fox, Golden Fleece, Sparrow Hawk - once there were 35 A-4s. One was destroyed in a second world war air raid on York and the rest were decommissioned in the sixties, that reign of terror for the steam train. Now there are only six A-4s left, four of which are in Britain. The grande dame herself, the Mallard, takes pride of place in the National Railway Museum.</p> <p>A chance remark during a newspaper interview resulted in a call from the North Yorkshire Moors Railway, the preservation society now running what was once the Whitby to Pickering line, offering a trip on the Sir Nigel Gresley, the engine named for the great man himself. The line, planned under the supervision of George Stephenson of Rocket fame and opened in 1836, using trains drawn by horses, is one of the oldest in the country. It was closed by British Rail as part of the Beeching cuts in the Sixties.</p> <p>We set off early from Edinburgh and drive without stopping for breakfast so that when we arrive on the station platform at Grosmont, the sight of the tea-room (with a real coal fire) provides a brief but welcome encounter with coffee and buttered scones. </p> <p>Grosmont appears completely authentic - a station preserved in time - but, like most of the other features on the line, a considerable portion of it has been cobbled together from the leftovers of abandoned stations - a booking office here, a lamp-post there.</p> <p>And here she is, the Sir Nigel herself (even locos with male names are female), number 60007, painted in the old BR blue livery and almost pawing at the ground as she works up a head of steam. So it's on with the overalls and on to the footplate with George, the driver, Peter the fireman and Roger, who is the custodian of the engine for the Sir Nigel Gresley Locomotive Preservation Trust.</p> <p>We are a full complement - the maximum number of crew allowed on the footplate is four. Peter gallantly offers me the fireman's seat, although as the journey progresses it becomes difficult to see when a fireman ever gets to sit down. The job is a lot more than just shovelling coal. For one thing, he has to keep an eye on all those dials so that the boiler doesn't either lose pressure or 'blow-off', that is, build up too much steam, although every time anyone says this I think they're saying 'blow-up'. A little nerve-racking, especially as, when we do let off steam, there is an ear-shattering noise in the cab.</p> <p>In bright spring sunshine, we set off across the North York Moors which are eerily deserted, having been closed by the spectre of foot-and-mouth disease.

      "bodyText": "I have been in love with steam trains for as long as I can remember. I have railways in my blood. I come from a railway town, my uncle and grandfather were employed at the now-defunct carriage works in my old home town of York. I was brought up in a house beside the York to Scarborough line and spent many a happy hour of my childhood waving to the train drivers. I also have vivid childhood memories of visiting the small museum that closed to make way for the National Railway Museum in York. In those days, you could climb into the locomotive cabs and touch all those polished brass dials and levers. (And a note to all those men who always tell me that my obsession with trains is a phallic thing: do they honestly think their rather unattractive genitals bear any relation to a 102-ton steel locomotive? I think not.) My greatest wish has always been to ride on the footplate of a Class A-4 Pacific locomotive, the most magnificent thing ever to come out of an engineering shed. The A-4 Pacific was Britain's very own streamliner, an art-deco 'racehorse' introduced in 1935, just in time for George V's silver jubilee. The A-4s were designed by Sir Nigel Gresley - probably the greatest locomotive engineer the world has ever seen. In the thirties, the goal of steam was speed and a Doncaster-built A-4 called the Mallard provided it by hurtling through the Lincolnshire countryside at 126mph to became the fastest steam locomotive in the world. At the time, it must have seemed as though this was only the latest achievement in a race that would go on forever - that better, faster engines would come along and overtake the Mallard's achievement. History, however, knows better and the Mallard now holds the record for steam 'for all time', a poignant phrase on a par with 'the line ended in daughters'. Falcon, Wild Swan, Kingfisher, Merlin, Silver Fox, Golden Fleece, Sparrow Hawk - once there were 35 A-4s. One was destroyed in a second world war air raid on York and the rest were decommissioned in the sixties, that reign of terror for the steam train. Now there are only six A-4s left, four of which are in Britain. The grande dame herself, the Mallard, takes pride of place in the National Railway Museum. A chance remark during a newspaper interview resulted in a call from the North Yorkshire Moors Railway, the preservation society now running what was once the Whitby to Pickering line, offering a trip on the Sir Nigel Gresley, the engine named for the great man himself. The line, planned under the supervision of George Stephenson of Rocket fame and opened in 1836, using trains drawn by horses, is one of the oldest in the country. It was closed by British Rail as part of the Beeching cuts in the Sixties. We set off early from Edinburgh and drive without stopping for breakfast so that when we arrive on the station platform at Grosmont, the sight of the tea-room (with a real coal fire) provides a brief but welcome encounter with coffee and buttered scones. Grosmont appears completely authentic - a station preserved in time - but, like most of the other features on the line, a considerable portion of it has been cobbled together from the leftovers of abandoned stations - a booking office here, a lamp-post there. And here she is, the Sir Nigel herself (even locos with male names are female), number 60007, painted in the old BR blue livery and almost pawing at the ground as she works up a head of steam. So it's on with the overalls and on to the footplate with George, the driver, Peter the fireman and Roger, who is the custodian of the engine for the Sir Nigel Gresley Locomotive Preservation Trust. We are a full complement - the maximum number of crew allowed on the footplate is four. Peter gallantly offers me the fireman's seat, although as the journey progresses it becomes difficult to see when a fireman ever gets to sit down. The job is a lot more than just shovelling coal. For one thing, he has to keep an eye on all those dials so that the boiler doesn't either lose pressure or 'blow-off', that is, build up too much steam, although every time anyone says this I think they're saying 'blow-up'. A little nerve-racking, especially as, when we do let off steam, there is an ear-shattering noise in the cab. In bright spring sunshine, we set off across the North York Moors which are eerily deserted, having been closed by the spectre of foot-and-mouth disease. We won't be breaking any records today, for although the Sir Nigel holds the postwar record for speed (112mph), restrictions on private railway lines dictate a paltry 25mph. Everything is somehow as I imagined it: the signalman requesting a shovelful of coal for his fire, the hosing down of the footplate (George runs a clean cab), the exchanging of tokens at every station. I am in a state of bliss, especially as I get to blow the whistle all the way there and back. Grosmont, Goathland, Newton Dale Halt, Levisham, Pickering - the 18-mile journey takes us past beautiful scenery and bizarre sights, such as the early-warning station at Fylingdales, where the Prisoner-like golf ball shapes have been replaced by an equally surreal receiver that looks like a giant wedge of cheese. The line also boasts one of the steepest gradients in the country - 1 in 49. Even if you've never been to the North York Moors you will almost certainly have seen this railway and the trains that run on it, in The Secret Garden, Brideshead Revisited and countless other films and television productions. Goathland is the Aidensfield of Heartbeat and Grosmont stars as Hogwarts Station in the new Harry Potter movie. On the train is a small American boy following the 'Harry Potter trail'. George, our driver, jokes that he's expecting his Equity card any day now.

The Government insisted the new policy was merely a refinement.</p> <p>Good looks and a remarkable tale made Phoenix internationally famous at the age of two weeks. She has appeared in newspapers and television news programmes around the world. Her owners, Michaela and Philip Board, have had to stay up at night not to feed her, but to do radio shows in Sydney, Australia.</p> <p>She was born on Clarence Farm near Axminister, Devon, her mother a Belgian Blue, and her father a Charolais, an all-white breed prized for their beef. But Phoenix was not born to be a burger, but to breed, her purpose in life to give birth to other cows that will be slaughtered and eaten. Under normal circumstances, she would have lived for many years.</p> <p>But just after she was born, an outbreak of foot and mouth at a neighbouring farm meant that all animals at Clarence Farm had to be culled within 48 hours even if they were healthy. It was this policy that condemned Phoenix, worth \u00a3100, to death.</p> <p>On Wednesday 18 April, five days after her birth, the overalled Ministry slaughtermen arrived at Clarence Farm, corralled the animals inside the big barn and closed the doors. Philip Board stayed inside his bungalow with his wife and son, Ross.</p> <p>The slaughtermen administered lethal injections to 15 cows and around 30 sheep. They killed two other calves, both less than a week old. The job done, they left the carcasses behind closed the doors until they could be disposed of.</p> <p>Five days later, the pile of bodies rotting, more men from the Ministry came to disinfect them. When they opened the doors, amid the putrefying scene of carnage, angelic Phoenix got up and walked towards them, mooing quietly. She had spent five days next to the body of her dead mother.</p> <p>Startled, the men went back to the bungalow and told the farmer the news. 'I couldn't believe it. I told them they must be joking,' recalled Philip. 'But they weren't.' Nobody knows whether the calf was given the injection and survived, or was simply overlooked.</p> <p>Despite its miraculous survival, Philip and Michaela knew the calf with no name still had to be culled. 'I was so cross we found her alive among the dead animals. I was fuming that an animal could be treated that way,' said Michaela. 'I phoned Maff and gave them an hour to deal with it, or else I would go to the press.'</p> <p>An hour passed, and no one from Maff arrived or called back. In fury, Michaela phoned the Express and Echo in Exeter. The farmers realised the calf needed a name, and Michaela suggested Lucky. Philip said a calf born on Friday 13th only to watch its mother killed five days later was anything but lucky, and suggested Phoenix. They took Phoenix to the garage and bottle-fed her.</p> <p>A photographer took her picture, the story appeared in the local paper and the nationals picked it up. The photo was iconic: the pure white calf peering out of the black background. The photographer later said that if Phoenix had been a dark calf, the image just wouldn't have had the same impact.</p> <p>A Maff vet gave Phoenix a clean bill of health, but still the Ministry insisted the calf must die. Mr Board phoned his solicitor. A Maff official, a slaughterman and a policeman arrived at the farm, and the Boards stood their ground. They told the Maff official they would need a court injunction. The policeman, there to protect the slaughterman, ended up having to do the opposite. He told the Maff official they would have to leave the land. Phoenix survived the second attempt to kill her. Maff was furious: 'Phoenix has to die. This stand will not alter what we have to do.'</p> <p>But pleas to spare Phoenix flooded in. The Mirror launched a campaign to 'Save Phoenix from the Ashes'. Animal rights groups and actress Carla Lane threw in their support. Anthony Gibson, regional director of the National Farmer's Union, said the calf's slaughter would 'make King Herod look like a humanitarian'. Tony Banks, Labour MP and former Government Minister, spat: 'I was extremely angry. The idea of slaughtering this animal was totally unacceptable. The officials from Maff are Daleks.'</p> <p>Phoenix recovered, played with the farm dogs, danced around on her hooves. Clarence Farm was deluged with flowers and cards. The farmer's 11-year-old son Ross said: 'If Maff had a heart, they'd leave Phoenix alone.'</p> <p>A Maff spokesman denounced the 'hideous sentimentality'. They had a point: after all, most of the animals being culled had been bred for slaughter.</p> <p>But the national mood was set. On Wednesday, a Downing Street spokesman announced there would be a change in slaughter policy so that healthy animals in neighbouring farms would no longer automatically be killed. It was, of course, nothing to do with Phoenix, but the spokesman admitted: 'As a result, Phoenix will be saved.'</p> <p>The first Agriculture Secretary Nick Brown knew of the change was when he heard it on the 10 O' Clock News. The switch had been made in Downing Street, which overruled Maff. Brown was furious but made a dutiful statement to the Commons. It wasn't a relaxation but a revision: vets would be given more discretion on whether healthy animals would be culled or not. In fact, they had had this discretion all along, but weren't using it.</p> <p>Phoenix's reprieve was widely celebrated. The Boards rejected a tabloid's offer to buy the calf, insisting she was now a pet. Her remarkable tale crystallised a widespread but muted revulsion against the slaughter of healthy animals and she became the perfect symbol at the perfect time. She can now live the rest of her life in peaceful obscurity.</p> <p><b> Phoenix the calf</b><br></p> <p><b> DoB:</b> Good Friday, 13 April 2001</p> <p><b> Appearance:</b> Cuddly white fluffy toy</p> <p><b> Hobbies:</b> Playing with the dogs on Clarence Farm, dancing on her hooves and being bottle fed with milk</p> <p><b> Family:</b> Mother culled in front of her</p> <p><b> Big moment:</b> Surviving to become international celebrity and changing Government slaughter policy at the age of two weeks</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:anthony.browne@observer.co.uk\">anthony.browne@observer.co.uk</a></p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email\">Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up</a></p> <p><b>The Phoenix factor</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,479044,00.html\">26.04.2001, comment: Phoenix highlights hypocrisy</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,479026,00.html\">26.04.2001: Animal cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bres: where are they now?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,478959,00.html\">26.04.2001: What does contiguous mean?</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,479334,00.html\">27.04.2001: Brown not told of reprieve for calf</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,479274,00.html\">27.04.2001: Confusion rises over cull policy after Phoenix</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,478807,00.html\">26.04.2001: Brown to announce reduced cull</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,478810,00.html\">26.04.2001: Phoenix is a 'ray of light' for farming industry</a></p> <p><b>More on the election and foot and mouth</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/footandmouth\">Politics: foot and mouth</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth\">Foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/footandmouth/\">Election 2001: foot and mouth</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/food/\">What's wrong with our food?</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bse/\">BSE</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/country/0,2759,181093,00.html\">Countryside in crisis</a></p>",

She was born on Clarence Farm near Axminister, Devon, her mother a Belgian Blue, and her father a Charolais, an all-white breed prized for their beef. But Phoenix was not born to be a burger, but to breed, her purpose in life to give birth to other cows that will be slaughtered and eaten. Under normal circumstances, she would have lived for many years. But just after she was born, an outbreak of foot and mouth at a neighbouring farm meant that all animals at Clarence Farm had to be culled within 48 hours even if they were healthy. It was this policy that condemned Phoenix, worth \u00a3100, to death. On Wednesday 18 April, five days after her birth, the overalled Ministry slaughtermen arrived at Clarence Farm, corralled the animals inside the big barn and closed the doors. Philip Board stayed inside his bungalow with his wife and son, Ross. The slaughtermen administered lethal injections to 15 cows and around 30 sheep. They killed two other calves, both less than a week old. The job done, they left the carcasses behind closed the doors until they could be disposed of. Five days later, the pile of bodies rotting, more men from the Ministry came to disinfect them. When they opened the doors, amid the putrefying scene of carnage, angelic Phoenix got up and walked towards them, mooing quietly. She had spent five days next to the body of her dead mother. Startled, the men went back to the bungalow and told the farmer the news. 'I couldn't believe it. I told them they must be joking,' recalled Philip. 'But they weren't.' Nobody knows whether the calf was given the injection and survived, or was simply overlooked. Despite its miraculous survival, Philip and Michaela knew the calf with no name still had to be culled. 'I was so cross we found her alive among the dead animals. I was fuming that an animal could be treated that way,' said Michaela. 'I phoned Maff and gave them an hour to deal with it, or else I would go to the press.' An hour passed, and no one from Maff arrived or called back. In fury, Michaela phoned the Express and Echo in Exeter. The farmers realised the calf needed a name, and Michaela suggested Lucky. Philip said a calf born on Friday 13th only to watch its mother killed five days later was anything but lucky, and suggested Phoenix. They took Phoenix to the garage and bottle-fed her. A photographer took her picture, the story appeared in the local paper and the nationals picked it up. The photo was iconic: the pure white calf peering out of the black background. The photographer later said that if Phoenix had been a dark calf, the image just wouldn't have had the same impact. A Maff vet gave Phoenix a clean bill of health, but still the Ministry insisted the calf must die. Mr Board phoned his solicitor. A Maff official, a slaughterman and a policeman arrived at the farm, and the Boards stood their ground. They told the Maff official they would need a court injunction. The policeman, there to protect the slaughterman, ended up having to do the opposite. He told the Maff official they would have to leave the land. Phoenix survived the second attempt to kill her. Maff was furious: 'Phoenix has to die. This stand will not alter what we have to do.' But pleas to spare Phoenix flooded in. The Mirror launched a campaign to 'Save Phoenix from the Ashes'. Animal rights groups and actress Carla Lane threw in their support. Anthony Gibson, regional director of the National Farmer's Union, said the calf's slaughter would 'make King Herod look like a humanitarian'. Tony Banks, Labour MP and former Government Minister, spat: 'I was extremely angry. The idea of slaughtering this animal was totally unacceptable. The officials from Maff are Daleks.' Phoenix recovered, played with the farm dogs, danced around on her hooves. Clarence Farm was deluged with flowers and cards. The farmer's 11-year-old son Ross said: 'If Maff had a heart, they'd leave Phoenix alone.' A Maff spokesman denounced the 'hideous sentimentality'. They had a point: after all, most of the animals being culled had been bred for slaughter. But the national mood was set. On Wednesday, a Downing Street spokesman announced there would be a change in slaughter policy so that healthy animals in neighbouring farms would no longer automatically be killed. It was, of course, nothing to do with Phoenix, but the spokesman admitted: 'As a result, Phoenix will be saved.' The first Agriculture Secretary Nick Brown knew of the change was when he heard it on the 10 O' Clock News. The switch had been made in Downing Street, which overruled Maff. Brown was furious but made a dutiful statement to the Commons. It wasn't a relaxation but a revision: vets would be given more discretion on whether healthy animals would be culled or not. In fact, they had had this discretion all along, but weren't using it. Phoenix's reprieve was widely celebrated. The Boards rejected a tabloid's offer to buy the calf, insisting she was now a pet. Her remarkable tale crystallised a widespread but muted revulsion against the slaughter of healthy animals and she became the perfect symbol at the perfect time. She can now live the rest of her life in peaceful obscurity.

I scanned the Massage Menu at Doctor Franklin's Ayurvedic Centre and decided to go for the Keralan Speciality. </p> <p>I was expecting a temple of warbling New Age music, perfumed oils and smiling masseuses in white coats. The room I was shown into was more reminiscent of an S&amp;M dungeon; pitch black and empty but for a rubber mattress on the floor with a rope swinging ominously above it and an equally portentous examination table in the corner. What exactly did this Keralan Speciality involve? </p> <p>A tiny sari-clad woman marched in, briskly warming a bottle of oil between her doll-sized hands. 'On your FRONT!' she ordered and I hit the deck, or rather the greasy mattress. Rolling up her sari in a businesslike manner, she bounced on to the mattress with the agility of a 10-year-old. She poured sweet-smelling sandalwood oil on to my back, my neck, my legs and then she stepped firmly onto my head, took hold of the rope and proceeded to stamp along the length of my body, swinging like Tarzan. Her calloused feet pounded every inch of my body and I gasped as she mercilessly trod out every knotted muscle in turn. Paying no attention to my strangled entreaties to be slightly gentler please, she informed me that she had trained with 'Doctor FRANKLIN, very famous'. This was a great comfort to me. </p> <p>After the initial bone crunching was over, she dropped to her knees and pummelled me with her gnarled hands, flipping me over like a helpless amoeba at regular intervals. I resigned myself to her dextrous ministrations and even fell into a dazed trance as she kneaded me with incredible strength. Next I was ordered to climb on to the examination table. She massaged my face and feet with featherlight touches, stopping at times to choose different oils, according to my particular Ayurvedic type. Now that the rough stuff was over, I began to feel incredibly invigorated and renewed, as though she had wrung me out from the inside as well. </p> <p>Ayurveda translates as the 'science of life'. A person can be diagnosed as predominantly one of three body types or 'doshas' - Kapa, Vada or Pitta. Optimum health and wellbeing can be achieved when the three doshas are balanced, through diet and treatments such as massage. Whilst there are Ayurvedic treatments available throughout India, there is some truth to Kerala's claim be the original home of this 5,000-year-old system and there are many renowned schools and institutions here dedicated to the teaching of the principles of Ayurveda. Here you can spend anything from a weekend to a year learning more about this science. In any case, no trip to Kerala is complete without an Ayurvedic treatment, whether it is a massage or a facial. </p> <p>'So, which Ayurvedic type am I?' I asked my diminutive masseuse, as I paid her 500 rupees (\u00a38) for the 90-minute experience. All I got in response was a toothless cackle and a pitying 'Western type!'. She told me not to wash the oil off for an hour and I staggered off gratefully, greasily, to spread the word about Ayurvedic massages. </p> <p>\u0095 For further information on Ayurvedic treatments and a list of Ayurvedic health centres and practitioners in Kerala, visit <a href=\"http://www.ayurveda-in.com/ayurveda.html\">www.ayurveda-in.com/ayurveda.html</a>.</p>",

      "body": "<p>With his weathered face and luxuriant moustache, Doug Morey looks as a pilot should. He began flying in the Sixties in the United States Air Force, graduated to private charter work and, when he got bored with that, went to Africa for six months. 'I never left,' Morey tells me. 'Air traffic control isn't as hi-tech as in Europe. Pilots out here aren't just extensions of somebody's computer. We have to think for ourselves and I like it.' </p> <p>Morey flies a fleet of small planes for Air Kenya which mostly fly tourists to game reserves. He offered me a spin to the Masai Mara. Our flight included a giddy 200-second hop between two air strips, which he was set to enter for the Guinness Book of Records as the world's shortest commercial flight until he heard there was a shorter one in the Orkneys. </p> <p>He dropped me at a place called Little Governors' Camp, run by a friend of his, Murray Levett. It turned out to be a Hemingwayesque former hunting camp, where tourists sipped tea in front of luxurious tents around a lake where hippos wallowed. Armed Masai guards looked on keenly. Murray makes a living designing and building these Edenic camps. </p> <p>If that seemed like the good life, I had yet to meet Robin and Greg, the pilots of the camp's balloons, which fly tourists across the Mara at dawn, before a champagne breakfast in the bush (Governors' is proud of its status as Kenya's largest consumer of champagne). I wondered if there might be a spare place aboard the balloons, but both were fully booked. We repaired to the bar for a cold glass of the local Tusker beer. </p> <p>'You're a pilot and you've never been ballooning!' exploded Robin, who has a passion for the sport, and whose uncanny resemblance to another well-known balloonist results in requests for Richard Branson's autograph. After a long and largely liquid lunch, room had been found for me. </p> <p>Next morning, I watched as two of the world's largest balloons - each 10 storeys high - were inflated, looking in the pre-dawn darkness like a fiery scene out of Dante. I clambered into Greg's wicker basket, he heaved on a rope, an 8ft tongue of flame leapt into the canopy and we were airborne. </p> <p>It was starting to get light. The sky grew slowly pink, revealing the River Mara shrouded in silver mist. Suspended at 1,500ft, we watched the rising sun cast long shadows across a landscape of emerald marshes and honey-coloured grasses, awakening flocks of birds and herds of buffalo and antelope. We could also see the ground crew, their Land Rovers tracing our course, carrying a cargo of eggs and bubbly. We watched a male leopard slinking through tall grass close to a herd of impala. The American woman beside me murmured: 'This is the best experience I have ever had.' </p> <p>After 90 minutes aloft, Greg asked: 'Where shall we land?' 'How about next to Robin?' said an adolescent wag. Robin had landed ahead of us, far to our right and everyone knows balloons can't be steered. </p> <p>'I'll do my best,' said Greg. For 10 minutes, he felt his way forward, intuitively working the light airs that, at different altitudes, blew in slightly different directions. Sometimes, we rose high; at others, the basket was so low that it brushed the grass. To our astonishment, Greg brought us precisely to the other balloon and laid the basket to earth without even a bump. As I climbed out, corks popped and the smell of eggs and bacon filled the still morning air.</p>",

'Air traffic control isn't as hi-tech as in Europe. Pilots out here aren't just extensions of somebody's computer. We have to think for ourselves and I like it.' Morey flies a fleet of small planes for Air Kenya which mostly fly tourists to game reserves. He offered me a spin to the Masai Mara. Our flight included a giddy 200-second hop between two air strips, which he was set to enter for the Guinness Book of Records as the world's shortest commercial flight until he heard there was a shorter one in the Orkneys. He dropped me at a place called Little Governors' Camp, run by a friend of his, Murray Levett. It turned out to be a Hemingwayesque former hunting camp, where tourists sipped tea in front of luxurious tents around a lake where hippos wallowed. Armed Masai guards looked on keenly. Murray makes a living designing and building these Edenic camps. If that seemed like the good life, I had yet to meet Robin and Greg, the pilots of the camp's balloons, which fly tourists across the Mara at dawn, before a champagne breakfast in the bush (Governors' is proud of its status as Kenya's largest consumer of champagne). I wondered if there might be a spare place aboard the balloons, but both were fully booked. We repaired to the bar for a cold glass of the local Tusker beer. 'You're a pilot and you've never been ballooning!' exploded Robin, who has a passion for the sport, and whose uncanny resemblance to another well-known balloonist results in requests for Richard Branson's autograph. After a long and largely liquid lunch, room had been found for me. Next morning, I watched as two of the world's largest balloons - each 10 storeys high - were inflated, looking in the pre-dawn darkness like a fiery scene out of Dante. I clambered into Greg's wicker basket, he heaved on a rope, an 8ft tongue of flame leapt into the canopy and we were airborne. It was starting to get light. The sky grew slowly pink, revealing the River Mara shrouded in silver mist. Suspended at 1,500ft, we watched the rising sun cast long shadows across a landscape of emerald marshes and honey-coloured grasses, awakening flocks of birds and herds of buffalo and antelope. We could also see the ground crew, their Land Rovers tracing our course, carrying a cargo of eggs and bubbly. We watched a male leopard slinking through tall grass close to a herd of impala. The American woman beside me murmured: 'This is the best experience I have ever had.' After 90 minutes aloft, Greg asked: 'Where shall we land?' 'How about next to Robin?' said an adolescent wag. Robin had landed ahead of us, far to our right and everyone knows balloons can't be steered. 'I'll do my best,' said Greg. For 10 minutes, he felt his way forward, intuitively working the light airs that, at different altitudes, blew in slightly different directions. Sometimes, we rose high; at others, the basket was so low that it brushed the grass. To our astonishment, Greg brought us precisely to the other balloon and laid the basket to earth without even a bump. As I climbed out, corks popped and the smell of eggs and bacon filled the still morning air.",

The prospect has been raised by geneticists who have revealed the biological secret of creatures that can replace limbs that have been severed in fights or attacks by predators. This ability - possessed by animals such as the salamander, which can regenerate entire legs and various species of lizards, which can regrow tails - has baffled scientists for centuries. But now, thanks to breakthroughs in modern molecular biology, researchers have discovered this process is controlled by a genetic signal switched on in cells of amphibians but turned off in mammals. 'The presence of this activated gene in amphibians allows them to regrow legs,' said Professor Juan Belmonte, of the gene expression laboratory at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California. 'More importantly, its absence explains why higher vertebrate creatures like ourselves cannot regenerate lost limbs. 'That awareness in turn raises the prospect that we could one day intervene and switch on this gene. In other words, we could could regrow lost organs.'

However, we have to understand a lot more about the whole complex cascade of chemicals that are involved in this business before we can go plunging in at the deep end.' Mammals appeared long after amphibians evolved on Earth. The latter already possessed the power to regenerate limbs. So why did mammals cast it aside? 'We simply don't know at present,' said Belmonte. 'However, it is very likely the signals that trigger limb regeneration are similar to those that trigger cell division - and are linked to the development of cancer. 'Limb regeneration may be great for salamanders and lizards, but when longer-living creatures - such as mammals - evolved, it left them vulnerable to cancer. So the business was dropped like an evolutionary hot potato. 'If that is true, we clearly have to proceed carefully.' added Belmonte.",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of thousands of British schoolchildren, some as young as 11, have experimented with hard drugs, including heroin and cocaine, and many more use cannabis, amphetamines or glue on a weekly basis, according to a major new survey. More than one in 100 boys aged 12 said they had tried heroin. A similar number of 11-year-olds said they had tried cocaine. Around twice as many said they had used cannabis, glue or had sniffed propellents and inhalants known as 'gas'. The findings, based on questionnaires filled in by 20,000 children in 67 secondary schools last year, contradict recent government claims that juvenile drug use is falling. Last week experts called for a complete overhaul of Britain's drugs education programmes. The biggest such exercise ever undertaken, the survey is the first to look in detail at the habitual use of drugs by schoolchildren. It aimed to show whether they used drugs regularly rather than on an experimental basis. A user was defined as someone taking drugs on a weekly basis for at least three months. 'The results were very striking,' said Jeremy Gluck, of Adolescent Assessment Services, the Swansea-based consultancy that carried out the survey on behalf of local education authorities. 'Drug use is much more extensive than we thought. The sheer numbers involved are very worrying. Some totals were so high that we genuinely didn't want to believe them.' The survey found that one in nine 16-year-old boys who admitted using drugs said they did so every day. More than a third used drugs - mainly cannabis, but also harder drugs - at least once a week. The figures for girls were only slightly lower and nearly 8 per cent of all 16-year-olds said they had been using drugs, including ecstasy and LSD, on a weekly basis for at least three months. The survey also found that patterns of drug use shifted according to age. A fifth of 16-year-old boys said they preferred cannabis, whereas only one in 50 said they habitually used glue or gas. It also looked at drinking and smoking. It found that 5 per cent of 11-year-olds and 40 per cent of 16-year-olds drank alcohol on a weekly basis. A fifth of 16-year-old boys said they were 'drunk' - defined as 'feeling sick and falling about' - at least once a fortnight. The figures confirm a suspected increase in alcohol consumption among youngsters, especially in 'binge' drinking. According to the research, around one in 20 11-year-olds smoke daily. Nearly a third of 15-year-old girls do so, an increase of more than 40 per cent compared with 1998 official figures. Young smokers' habits are also surprisingly heavy. Around half of all 11- to 16-year-old smokers consume between six and 15 cigarettes daily. According to Gluck, one of the most significant findings is the importance of smoking and drinking to initiating later drug use. Children most commonly start to use drugs, cigarettes and alcohol between 13 and 14. There are concerns over the ability of schools to cope with the problem.

      "body": "<p>It was like a scene out of Le Carr\u00e9: the brilliant agent comes in from the cold and, in hours of debriefing, empties his memory of horrors committed in the name of an ideology gone rotten. </p> <p>But this was a far bigger catch than some used-up Cold War spy. The former apparatchik was Joseph Stiglitz, ex-chief economist of the World Bank. The new world economic order was his theory come to life. </p> <p>He was in Washington for the big confab of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. But instead of chairing meetings of ministers and central bankers, he was outside the police cordons. The World Bank fired Stiglitz two years ago. He was not allowed a quiet retirement: he was excommunicated purely for expressing mild dissent from globalisation World Bank-style. </p> <p>Here in Washington we conducted exclusive interviews with Stiglitz, for The Observer and Newsnight, about the inside workings of the IMF, the World Bank, and the bank's 51% owner, the US Treasury. </p> <p>And here, from sources unnamable (not Stiglitz), we obtained a cache of documents marked, 'confidential' and 'restricted'. </p> <p>Stiglitz helped translate one, a 'country assistance strategy'. There's an assistance strategy for every poorer nation, designed, says the World Bank, after careful in-country investigation. </p> <p>But according to insider Stiglitz, the Bank's 'investigation' involves little more than close inspection of five-star hotels. It concludes with a meeting with a begging finance minister, who is handed a 'restructuring agreement' pre-drafted for 'voluntary' signature. </p> <p>Each nation's economy is analysed, says Stiglitz, then the Bank hands every minister the same four-step programme. </p> <p>Step One is privatisation. Stiglitz said that rather than objecting to the sell-offs of state industries, some politicians - using the World Bank's demands to silence local critics - happily flogged their electricity and water companies. 'You could see their eyes widen' at the possibility of commissions for shaving a few billion off the sale price. </p> <p>And the US government knew it, charges Stiglitz, at least in the case of the biggest privatisation of all, the 1995 Russian sell-off. 'The US Treasury view was: \"This was great, as we wanted Yeltsin re-elected. We DON'T CARE if it's a corrupt election.\" ' </p> <p>Stiglitz cannot simply be dismissed as a conspiracy nutter. The man was inside the game - a member of Bill Clinton's cabinet, chairman of the President's council of economic advisers. </p> <p>Most sick-making for Stiglitz is that the US-backed oligarchs stripped Russia's industrial assets, with the effect that national output was cut nearly in half. </p> <p>After privatisation, Step Two is capital market liberalisation.

      "bodyText": "It was like a scene out of Le Carr\u00e9: the brilliant agent comes in from the cold and, in hours of debriefing, empties his memory of horrors committed in the name of an ideology gone rotten. But this was a far bigger catch than some used-up Cold War spy. The former apparatchik was Joseph Stiglitz, ex-chief economist of the World Bank. The new world economic order was his theory come to life. He was in Washington for the big confab of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. But instead of chairing meetings of ministers and central bankers, he was outside the police cordons. The World Bank fired Stiglitz two years ago. He was not allowed a quiet retirement: he was excommunicated purely for expressing mild dissent from globalisation World Bank-style. Here in Washington we conducted exclusive interviews with Stiglitz, for The Observer and Newsnight, about the inside workings of the IMF, the World Bank, and the bank's 51% owner, the US Treasury. And here, from sources unnamable (not Stiglitz), we obtained a cache of documents marked, 'confidential' and 'restricted'. Stiglitz helped translate one, a 'country assistance strategy'. There's an assistance strategy for every poorer nation, designed, says the World Bank, after careful in-country investigation. But according to insider Stiglitz, the Bank's 'investigation' involves little more than close inspection of five-star hotels. It concludes with a meeting with a begging finance minister, who is handed a 'restructuring agreement' pre-drafted for 'voluntary' signature. Each nation's economy is analysed, says Stiglitz, then the Bank hands every minister the same four-step programme. Step One is privatisation. Stiglitz said that rather than objecting to the sell-offs of state industries, some politicians - using the World Bank's demands to silence local critics - happily flogged their electricity and water companies. 'You could see their eyes widen' at the possibility of commissions for shaving a few billion off the sale price. And the US government knew it, charges Stiglitz, at least in the case of the biggest privatisation of all, the 1995 Russian sell-off. 'The US Treasury view was: \"This was great, as we wanted Yeltsin re-elected. We DON'T CARE if it's a corrupt election.\" ' Stiglitz cannot simply be dismissed as a conspiracy nutter. The man was inside the game - a member of Bill Clinton's cabinet, chairman of the President's council of economic advisers. Most sick-making for Stiglitz is that the US-backed oligarchs stripped Russia's industrial assets, with the effect that national output was cut nearly in half. After privatisation, Step Two is capital market liberalisation. In theory this allows investment capital to flow in and out. Unfortunately, as in Indonesia and Brazil, the money often simply flows out. Stiglitz calls this the 'hot money' cycle. Cash comes in for speculation in real estate and currency, then flees at the first whiff of trouble. A nation's reserves can drain in days. And when that happens, to seduce speculators into returning a nation's own capital funds, the IMF demands these nations raise interest rates to 30%, 50% and 80%. 'The result was predictable,' said Stiglitz. Higher interest rates demolish property values, savage industrial production and drain national treasuries. At this point, according to Stiglitz, the IMF drags the gasping nation to Step Three: market-based pricing - a fancy term for raising prices on food, water and cooking gas. This leads, predictably, to Step-Three-and-a-Half: what Stiglitz calls 'the IMF riot'. The IMF riot is painfully predictable.

But the forms it takes are culturally conditioned and subject to influences and fashions like anything else. It is not just attitudes to sex that change in different times and places, but the act itself. The range of sexual acts is not that wide, but what a culture regards as commonplace and what seems exotic has changed and will go on changing.</p> <p>Until quite recently, for instance, in Western culture, it seems to me that fellatio and cunnilingus were fairly exotic acts, an occasional divertissement. When the act was brought to the attention of England in the notorious Argyll divorce case in the Sixties, it was news to many readers of the Daily Beast that such a thing was possible or desirable, but then that was in the age of the weekly bath. </p> <p>References to both in literature are relatively rare and always produced with a flourish; there is the whore in Pope who is 'at either end a common shore', or Nelly in Rochester, who has to use 'hands, fingers, mouth, and thighs/ Ere she can raise the member she enjoys'. Cunnilingus is probably rarer; as late as Lolita, Humbert's 'bay[ing] through the undergrowth of dark decaying forests' is still meant to shock.</p> <p>With the improvement of personal hygiene in the West, these, and the previously still more exotic act of analingus, have become quite ordinary pastimes. Anecdotal evidence suggests that anal sex is still an exotic item of the vocabulary and one subject to negotiations between men and women; if it is a central part of male sexual fantasy, it is also an insistent, unspoken presence in the divorce courts. In other places and times, that has not been the case; the prevalence of heterosexual Aids in sub-Saharan Africa has been widely attributed to the resort to sodomy as a form of birth control.</p> <p>The spread of an individual practice is explicable by Richard Dawkins's idea of the 'meme'. What militates against the introduction of a new sexual practice is precisely its novelty, which will be enough to categorise it as a perversion in most cultures. If that novelty seems less important than the pleasure derived from it, then it will spread. A hundred years ago, fisting was more or less unheard of - in Teleny, a piece of late nineteenth-century pornography unconvincingly attributed to Oscar Wilde, a sepoy is fisted to death with the lubricating aid of foie gras, but I think that must be regarded as a one-off. Now, although still more or less limited to homosexual men, it is not that uncommon a practice.</p> <p>The fashions in individual acts are relatively easy to understand, but what is less susceptible to explication is the rise and fall of sexual identities which might seem fundamentally rooted in human nature. Homosexuality, in particular, is a poser; the prevalence of homosexuality now, compared to recent history, cannot entirely be explained away with reference to repression and taboo. Although there were always individuals who led a homosexual lifestyle, they were comparatively rare until recently. Astolphe de Custine was a rarity even in nineteenth-century France, where there was no legal prohibition. English law took no cognisance of lesbians, but the 'Ladies of Llangollen' were unusual enough to become a tourist attraction in the early nineteenth century. </p> <p>What these shifts in practice and attitude point to is never very clear and it is never wise to try to draw conclusions about the larger psychology of a society on the basis of its peculiar sexual habits. </p> <p>Occasionally, you can say something; it seems apparent that homosexual practices, until relatively recently, proceeded by analogy, and if sodomy became less common with the appearance of Aids, there was also a sense that same-gender relations need not always refer back to the penetrative habits of heterosexuals.</p> <p>Dennis Altman has an interesting subject here, but has not quite managed to illuminate it. The question of rape in the Balkans wars, for instance, cannot helpfully be discussed in isolation from the political context. Similarly, discussion of sexual tourism in Bangkok falls instantly and rather sleazily into an evocation of 'colonialism', which is rather a routine assumption. The sexual history of colonialism is far more complex than that, and provides no easy conclusions. To take an example from an episode I've been doing a lot of work on; the sexual relations between the British and the Afghans during the British occupation of Kabul in the late 1830s were not clearly exploitative; a major casus belli was that many Afghan men preferred each other to their wives, and many Afghan wives took British soldiers as their lovers. </p> <p>Bangkok is not a clear instance of colonial exploitation, but of economic inequality. That has always been the meaning of prostitution, and it is not very helpful to try to go much beyond that.

This is her defining characteristic as an artist. The subject of her work is Being Tracey Emin; the object is to make herself known. This is achieved as much through the art - the drawings, videos and embroideries, the famous tent, the even more famous bed - as through the incessant newspaper interviews, the appearances on billboard and box. Each feeds the other, is co-dependent, if not symbiotic. </p> <p>One result of this sustained exposure is that more people know about Emin's early life in Margate, her rape, her abortions, her drinking, her despair, than have ever seen the merest scrap of her art. Her celebrity as the star saboteur of TV's Turner Prize night, her torrentially outspoken behaviour and her emotional appeal as some sort of Hoxton Medea all outstrip her popularity as a visual artist. Which is why some people prefer to think of the woman as the total artwork in herself and why it is so hard to separate the objects she exhibits from the life. </p> <p>Thus, for example, at White Cube 2, in her first solo show in four years, you can't look at the hospital gown on its peg without wondering if and when Emin once wore it. You can't easily approach the two tiny chairs in the corner without wondering if they commemorate her lost twins, whose names she embroidered in the tent. Even those capable of extreme scepticism towards Emin - and there are many - could hardly view these items without compassion. They aren't asking to be admired as works of imagination - they are simply the relics of her experience. </p> <p>In the past, Emin might just have installed them in the gallery and left them to stand for themselves, like the bed, the beach hut or the newspaper cuttings about herself. Here, the hospital gown connects with a forlorn little drawing of a patient hooked up to a saline drip that looks painfully like a noose. The chairs are arranged in front of a video, in which Emin questions her mother, a wise and generous woman, about the effect on her life of having children. Moving associations are made between words and symbols, as between one life and the rest. Emin, it seems, is no longer so solipsistic. </p> <p>The whole show feels more cheerful and outgoing, more in the spirit of Emin's Mum. The walls are painted baby blue. There's a meadow of plants in one corner and a couple of perkily stuffed birds. Climb the ladder to a little treehouse and you find yourself looking through a peephole at a merry stranger whose smile broadens as he walks towards you. Enter the free-standing closet and you can watch a video of timid Tracey being bullied by her ferocious alter ego: the lamb, the witch and the wardrobe. </p> <p>Of course, there are plenty of Emin's trademark blankets, embroidered with tales from the cursed life of womankind like gigantic, miserabilist samplers. There are also dozens of her rachitic little figures, drawn in monoprint, that testify to the anguish - though also the pleasures - of her sexual life. Emin may be an old-fashioned expressionist, but she's a million miles from K\u00e4the Kollwitz or Egon Schiele when it comes to drawing. She's much stronger with caricature: absurdly fetishised shoes, toppled drinkers, nippy meerkats poised ready on their hind legs - a good mascot for any girl, 'Always watchful, always alert!' </p> <p>The centrepiece of this show, at least in terms of scale, is a helter-skelter made out of bare plyboard. Without stairs, and not quite big enough for an adult, this is clearly intended to be an impossible ride. The gallery is also handing out a short text by Emin in which she refers to the way one tiny incident can send you helter-skelter in a downward spiral. But the words are quite not in kilter with the model, which is too small and quaint to disturb. Maybe Emin was thinking of Louise Bourgeois's colossal helter-skelters, made for Tate Modern last year, up which one clambered only to be confronted by a grotesquely enlarged reflection of oneself. </p> <p>Like Bourgeois, Emin is often aggressively defensive. Unlike Bourgeois, she can be comically pathetic, as in the title of this show, You Forgot to Kiss My Soul , written up in Barbie-pink neon. It's a sharp self-parody, in keeping with the closet video in which she hams a good-girl Tracey, in dressing-gown and slippers, pretending to cower as her bad-girl counterpart hammers on the door by night. The battle between marauding ego and abject id is always Emin's best performance - and performance is what she does best: dramatising, and now sending herself up as the double-act of confessional art. </p> <p>Earlier in the year the Saatchi Gallery announced a forthcoming show by Damien Hirst. It was a no-show. The substitute is <strong> New Labour</strong>, an anthology of nearly-new work. The first thing you see in the foyer is Liane Lang's animated film in which a Plasticine hand fumbles at a Plasticine clitoris. Masturbation is ineptly modelled, clumsily filmed and its sniggering joke - putty in her own hands - is as crude as everything else. </p> <p>The piece was made in 1997, the year of the Sensation show at the Royal Academy. It reminds you just how much art was being made in crass imitation in those days, and how much of it was bought by Saatchi. It's undoubtedly a mistake to deduce a buyer's tastes from his collection, particularly when it is as manifestly various as this one. But now that the scene has contracted and changed, Saatchi still seems to be buying sexual one-liners. </p> <p>Rebecca Warren makes unfired clay sculptures that play on the roughly-modelled 'non-finito' state, and on the writhing forms of classical statues. From her claggy grey lumps, reminiscent of the clay sweating beneath its polythene in the art-room cupboard, the emerging forms writhe in lewd and prodigious orgies. Here and there, as in the crucifixion with erection and gilded thumb tacks, she applies a decorative glaze to the clay, an idea she shares with Grayson Perry. </p> <p>Dozens of Perry's vessels are displayed in rows, like a graveyard of classical urns. This doesn't do him any favours. It makes what he does, which is to explore his psyche, plus the seediness of the world in general and the art world in particular, in drawings, words and photographs, all decorated with Victorian decals and glazed with fine lustre, seem like a repetitive gimmick. Yet Perry makes ingenious use of each vessel's separate shape in evolving his circular narratives. </p> <p>Saatchi's bulk-buy habits work both ways. DJ Simpson's colossal abstract 'paintings', made using an electric router to cut through the archaeological layers of laminated board, seem to cancel each other out in close confinement. But Martin Maloney's friezes work brilliantly as a suite, a version of pastoral for the city. Dog lovers, girls on bikes, mothers loving children, each is elaborated in tiny fragments of bright vinyl glued to a sheet of cartridge. Together, they amount to a modern mosaic of urban life; instead of a marble pavement, set forth on a page.</p>",

The UK auction last summer was one of Europe's most expensive: netting the Treasury \u00a322.5 billion and costing Vodafone \u00a35.96bn and BT Cellnet and One 2 One around \u00a34bn each for their licences. </p> <p>'There are huge differences in prices that were paid,' he concedes.

      "body": "<p>Homework. Cornflakes. Swimming things. Toast. Packed lunches. Fruit juice. Bus money. Milk. Please wipe your mouth, darling. Weekday breakfast-times in millions of British households are stressful enough. But if you had only 30 seconds for a quick glance at the paper one morning three weeks ago, it suddenly got worse. Minutes before legions of small children were to be delivered into the care of childminders or nurseries, the headline, 'How daycare can make a toddler grow up unruly,' rebuked you from the page. </p> <p>New American research involving 1,300 children showed - apparently - that even when parents chose the best care, it could still be harmful. Disobedient. Badly behaved. Insecure. Anxious. That's how children end up, the new study confirmed. </p> <p>The research was endorsed by Jay Belsky, a feisty professor from London University. Could anything be better designed to make parents - and, let's be frank, mothers in particular - feel guilty, regretful and angst-ridden that they were about to leave their children with strangers once again? </p> <p>The same scene was played out in tens of millions more households, not just in Britain, but in the United States. A string of newspapers - from the Los Angeles Times to the International Herald Tribune - reported the same alarming story. One American tabloid said 'Mommy Wars' had broken out. </p> <p>Internet sites and message boards have been deluged with hits from worried parents. And last week's Time, a magazine emblematic of the American zeitgeist, pictured an elusive 'Superkid' on the cover, cautioning inside that Belsky's new research meant 'something awful for just about everyone'. </p> <p>Thousands more American therapists will be funding their mortgages as you read this, helped out by parents riddled with guilt at what they might be doing to their children. In Britain, we just worry. But parents still reflect, as they set off to work each day, that they have to pay the mortgage. So what else can they do? </p> <p>Calm down, for a start. What has quietly emerged in the past three days - with less fanfare and certainly much less hyperbole than the original story - is that the research trumpeted around the world might not be right. And it certainly would not be the first time that millions of parents have been terrified by claims from apparently reputable researchers, only for their fears to prove unjustified. </p> <p>Belsky first suggested 15 years ago that the absence of mothers might harm their children. He worked then at Pennsylvania State University, but his views were latched on to by battalions of enthusiastic 'family values' campaigners both in America and Britain. Meanwhile, the number of British working mothers with children under a year old has risen to almost 50 per cent. Small wonder that as a nation we hang on almost every word of those who claim to have discovered something new about the nature of childcare. </p> <p>Belsky, bright, earnest and media-friendly, has since moved to Birkbeck College, London, but still works with the American National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. It is this body's monitoring of children during the last decade which has provided the fuel for the 'Mommy Wars' controversy. </p> <p>But now some of the 12 other academics involved in the research have decided they did not like the publicity that Belsky is securing. They say that the professor's much-publicised interpretation of the data is flawed and that he 'hijacked' the study, in which he was only a minor player. Moreover, they claim he interpreted it in a way that will advance his anti-childcare agenda. </p> <p>They suggest that Belsky's dire pronouncements are not based on conclusive data, and that his identification as a 'principal investigator' in the study is wrong. 'Belsky interprets the findings very differently from us,' says Margaret Burchinal, the leading statistician on the 10-year project, with an academic's tact. 'Our results do not actually support his conclusions.' </p> <p>Children in the study, she says, 'were typical of what you'd expect for a normal four-year-old. We're not seeing that childcare produces super-aggressive kids.' What is not in dispute is that some children having full-time childcare tend to behave a little less well than others. 'They're slightly more likely to call each other names but they're not super-aggressive and could not even be labelled as aggressive,' she says. </p> <p>In almost complete contradiction of Belsky's reported claims, Burchinal adds: 'Our findings don't indicate that childcare is a major risk factor. The level of problems is not such that parents should make different decisions about their children based on this study.' </p> <p>And in an email to colleagues, the study's co-author, Professor Marsha Weinraub, now says witheringly: 'We did not prepare a press release because this report has not yet been peer-reviewed. This was a series of reports to conference colleagues. Generally, scientists are pretty circumspect in reporting conference findings, but this was not the case.' </p> <p>Other academics complain that the research has not been based on 'like-for-like' comparisons. Aggressive children might have other reasons for being unruly, such as aggressive parents or trauma in their early childhood. Researchers had not been able to make these distinctions. </p> <p>Back in Britain Stephen Burke, director of the widely respected Daycare Trust, says: 'Research like this causes parents unnecessary alarm. Our experience, based on evidence in this country, is that good quality childcare has benefits for children, not just in terms of learning, but in terms of positive behaviour. Childcare here is much more regulated than in the United States, and it's unclear how much Professor Belsky took this into account.' </p> <p>But Burke acknowledges a political perspective which terrified parents are all too inclined not to notice. 'The results of this research, interpreted in this way, can be used to promote an agenda which contradicts the reality of women with young children playing a bigger and bigger role in the workplace. </p> <p>'It would be far better to provide affordable childcare which enables them to do their job and give their children a good start in life. This issue is about dealing with the reality of life today rather than some fictional world of yesteryear.' </p> <p>Belsky, closeted at Birkbeck yesterday, refuses to discuss the backlash against him: 'I have no comment to make whatsoever.' But a friend sought to defend him: 'When people say that childcare is good for kids, no one complains. But when they say that parenting might be better, there is fury. </p> <p>'It's been practice for far too long to highlight the good news and pooh-pooh the bad. Women with careers and jobs are all worried that this sort of research will make working mothers look guilty. But they never give a twit when other news makes mothers at home feel like junk.' </p> <p>Whatever Belsky's motivation, he has undoubted charisma and chutzpah. And in a world where academics and researchers fight constantly for limited resources, it is those who project their work most effectively - and no one can deny Belsky does that - who win new cash and new research grants. </p> <p>Only last week Britain's Family Policy Studies Centre closed down. Its more traditional approach was not in tune with the political zeitgeist. But just as important, it has not achieved the public profile - and accompanying funding - that other researchers win easily. </p> <p>However, the outlets for some alarmist claims are complicit in stirring parental anxiety too. UK papers such as the Sunday Times and the Daily Mail are happy to set the hare running on stories promoting a 'family values' agenda. </p> <p>'If people choose their issue carefully, almost anyone can end up with some publicity,' says a leading think tank researcher. 'Find a not very bright journalist who won't ask too many questions and you can make headlines.' </p> <p>Even Belsky concedes: 'If I am monopolising the press, it is only because I am speaking clearly and the press appreciates that.' </p> <p>Media capacity to exploit parental anxiety is all too understandable. New Mori polling to be published this week by the Daycare Trust will reveal that 93 per cent of parents think affordable childcare should be available for all. </p> <p>As we all slowly learn to manage our work-life balance better - with childcarers a critical part of that - it's hardly surprising that we are so susceptible to guilt and alarm. And you know it's a sensitive issue when politicians use the eve of an election campaign to announce new concessions to working parents, as Trade Secretary Stephen Byers is expected to do this week. </p> <p>The last 'Mommy Wars' skirmish took place only six weeks ago. Research was widely publicised, by the now defunct Family Policy Studies Centre, which appeared to suggest that children with working parents achieved worse A-level results than those whose parents stayed at home. Just days after its enthusiastic celebration in the media, that story was undermined too. Rival researchers disputed the validity of a survey which started 30 years ago when British childcare was almost entirely unregulated. </p> <p>So if this week brings a further parenting scare, don't get too anxious about that either. Another one will be along shortly. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:ben.summerskill@observer.co.uk\">ben.summerskill@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

'It would be far better to provide affordable childcare which enables them to do their job and give their children a good start in life. This issue is about dealing with the reality of life today rather than some fictional world of yesteryear.' Belsky, closeted at Birkbeck yesterday, refuses to discuss the backlash against him: 'I have no comment to make whatsoever.' But a friend sought to defend him: 'When people say that childcare is good for kids, no one complains. But when they say that parenting might be better, there is fury. 'It's been practice for far too long to highlight the good news and pooh-pooh the bad. Women with careers and jobs are all worried that this sort of research will make working mothers look guilty. But they never give a twit when other news makes mothers at home feel like junk.' Whatever Belsky's motivation, he has undoubted charisma and chutzpah. And in a world where academics and researchers fight constantly for limited resources, it is those who project their work most effectively - and no one can deny Belsky does that - who win new cash and new research grants. Only last week Britain's Family Policy Studies Centre closed down. Its more traditional approach was not in tune with the political zeitgeist. But just as important, it has not achieved the public profile - and accompanying funding - that other researchers win easily. However, the outlets for some alarmist claims are complicit in stirring parental anxiety too. UK papers such as the Sunday Times and the Daily Mail are happy to set the hare running on stories promoting a 'family values' agenda. 'If people choose their issue carefully, almost anyone can end up with some publicity,' says a leading think tank researcher. 'Find a not very bright journalist who won't ask too many questions and you can make headlines.' Even Belsky concedes: 'If I am monopolising the press, it is only because I am speaking clearly and the press appreciates that.' Media capacity to exploit parental anxiety is all too understandable. New Mori polling to be published this week by the Daycare Trust will reveal that 93 per cent of parents think affordable childcare should be available for all. As we all slowly learn to manage our work-life balance better - with childcarers a critical part of that - it's hardly surprising that we are so susceptible to guilt and alarm. And you know it's a sensitive issue when politicians use the eve of an election campaign to announce new concessions to working parents, as Trade Secretary Stephen Byers is expected to do this week. The last 'Mommy Wars' skirmish took place only six weeks ago. Research was widely publicised, by the now defunct Family Policy Studies Centre, which appeared to suggest that children with working parents achieved worse A-level results than those whose parents stayed at home. Just days after its enthusiastic celebration in the media, that story was undermined too. Rival researchers disputed the validity of a survey which started 30 years ago when British childcare was almost entirely unregulated. So if this week brings a further parenting scare, don't get too anxious about that either. Another one will be along shortly. ben.summerskill@observer.co.uk",

In her internet stories, the writer slips in and out of history to become all the 'great and ruinous lovers' whose desires led them to tragedy - Lancelot, Francesca da Rimini, George Mallory. Her longing and suffering become theirs; her quest is doomed because she will risk everything for love but will not compromise, and as with all great passions there's a streak of masochism: 'Loving you is like lifting a heavy stone.

An embarrassment of riches, most definitely; when did you last read a book while grinning in anticipation of the next joke? The Faustian Bargain: The Art World in Nazi Germany Jonathan Petropoulos Penguin \u00a38.99, pp395 Buy it at a discount at BOL As a microcosm of the bourgeoisie or intelligentsia, the Third Reich's art world - at first glance, a subject of limited appeal - is in fact almost perfect for an analysis of the relationship between ethics and culture, or the ethics of the supposedly cultured. And yet their involvement is far from paradoxical, for the likes of Ernst Buchner were 'educated to revere high culture and to believe in German superiority in this regard', and visual artworks have generally been the pre ferred assets of plutocrats seeking to dignify their lucre. The psychology of mass denial is considered - Primo Levi's 'silent transition from falsehood to self-deception' - as is the extent of responsibility: were the half-dozen key figures known to deal directly with the F\u00fchrer and his high command victims of conformity or victimisers? Overall, this is indispensable reading on Nazi Germany and for everyone concerned with the relation between aesthetics and ethics. The Island in the Mind Rodney Hall Granta \u00a38.99, pp560 Buy it at a discount at BOL Australians seem to have a fondness for rewriting history to put their marginalised continent centrestage. After Einstein as an Australian, Stalin's lovechild raised down under, and Hall's own The Day We Had Hitler Home , this is a subtler comedy in which the 'isle full of noises' of Shakespeare's Tempest is relocated to the Antipodes. Drama and reality are remixed and shuffled so that the staging of the quasi- Tempest precedes a Venetian Miranda's attempt to save the soul of an Aboriginal Caliban before the long-sought land - as unfulfilled desire, as Paradise - is reached. More of a reinvention than a re-telling, this novella-trilogy manages to combine the speculation of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead with the fun and silliness of Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter . Cerebral and visceral, lavish and grotesque, Hall is indubitably the late Robertson Davies's literary heir. A triumph.",

Dylan's tale has been so frequently told, his works so extensively analysed, his associates so exhaustively interviewed, that even a life as carefully cloaked as his must surely have few further secrets to yield - in pop terms, only the Beatles can boast a comparable list of biography and criticism. But while the Fabs' story ended 20 or 30 years ago, Dylan's continues to ramble on. Just last month, he picked up his first Oscar - for 'Things Have Changed', the bleak hymn of disillusion he supplied for The Wonder Boys - which the ravaged icon acknowledged by video link from Australia, his current port of call on the 'never-ending tour' on which he's been hiding out for the last 15 years. </p> <p>You can find Dylan's Oscar acceptance speech on the web, along with the set lists from his Australian dates and from every other tour. You can also unearth a tally of the dogs (mostly large and fierce) owned and, it's alleged, apparently abandoned by the bard, and, on a site called Tangled Up In Jews, an account of where he celebrated Passover throughout the Eighties. Increasingly, Dylan studies are a matter of niche marketing; next month, for example, Bloomsbury issues David Hadju's Positively Fourth Street, a book devoted to the formative years on the Greenwich Village folk scene. </p> <p>Grand overviews of Dylan's sprawling, inconsistent career, from its roots in small-town Minnesota to the present, are harder to come by. One is confined to Clinton Heylin's recently updated Behind the Shades, now issued in paperback, and this new volume from Howard Sounes, whose previous books were biographies of the murderers Fred and Rose West and the writer Charles Bukowski. </p> <p>In Down the Highway, Sounes pulls off several revelatory coups, chief among them that in 1986 Dylan secretly married Carolyn Dennis, one of his backing singers, after she had added a sixth child, Desiree, to the five from his first marriage to model Sara Lownds. The couple set up home in a bland bungalow close to the roar of LA's Ventura Boulevard, though neither this nor Dylan's aggressive religiosity stopped him maintaining a series of other love affairs, such as that with label executive Carole Childs, who was also set up with a Beverly Hills home. </p> <p>If the apparent duplicity of his tangled love life is one reason for Dylan's secrecy, obsessive fans are another. After John Lennon's murder, and a series of stalking incidents, he purchased a bulletproof vest, and Sounes suggests that the list of problematic individuals held by Dylan's security staff currently runs to some 500 names. Endlessly bootlegged, his garbage ransacked, his every move scrutinised by an army of Bobaholics, it's small wonder Dylan says simply: 'Like most famous people, I want to be left alone.' </p> <p>Fat chance. Sounes put in three years and 250 interviews to produce Down the Highway, though the great man himself predictably declined to contribute. Engagingly written and scrupulously researched, it proves a sympathetic but never fawning account which moves evenly through Dylan's career; too evenly, since the comings and goings of years on the road are never going to yield the cultural payback of his mercurial Sixties.</p> <p>At a third longer, Heylin's book arguably offers more insight into the elusive psyche of one of pop's few bona fide geniuses. Yet it's Sounes who unravels Dylan's shrouded romantic life and business affairs more satisfactorily. He pries open the bitter legal battle between the singer and his former manager, Albert Grossman (resolved only after Grossman's death in 1986) and reveals the ruthless streak required of any star who wants to avoid being asset-stripped by the rapacious music business. </p> <p>Neither author, however, can explain just why Dylan, having gained control of his catalogue, should choose to let 'The Times They Are a Changing' become an advertising jingle for both the Bank of Montreal and the accountancy firm, Coopers and Lybrand. Sheer contrariness seems to be the best explanation, together with Dylan's distaste for the 'Voice of a Generation' tag foisted on him during his protest years. </p> <p>Dylan's perversity is a recurring theme. His various bands have all had to get used to his playing unannounced numbers in undeclared keys, to being roundly ignored when not on stage and to being summarily dismissed. </p> <p>Sounes is weakest where Dylan is at his strongest. The majestic trilogy of 1960s albums at the heart of Dylan's reputation - Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde, records which redefined the art of popular song - slip past unilluminated. Rarely does either book drive one to the source of all the wonder, the music itself, or offer a glimpse of its resonance.</p>",

A Life of Bob Dylan Howard Sounes Doubleday \u00a317.99, pp527 Buy it at a discount at BOL Bob Dylan, Behind the Shades: Take Two Clinton Heylin Penguin \u00a39.99, pp780 Buy it at a discount at BOL With the imminent sixtieth birthday of rock's poet laureate about to unloose a train of tributes and retrospective musings, is there anything left to say about the most mythologised figure in popular music? There shouldn't be. Dylan's tale has been so frequently told, his works so extensively analysed, his associates so exhaustively interviewed, that even a life as carefully cloaked as his must surely have few further secrets to yield - in pop terms, only the Beatles can boast a comparable list of biography and criticism. But while the Fabs' story ended 20 or 30 years ago, Dylan's continues to ramble on. Just last month, he picked up his first Oscar - for 'Things Have Changed', the bleak hymn of disillusion he supplied for The Wonder Boys - which the ravaged icon acknowledged by video link from Australia, his current port of call on the 'never-ending tour' on which he's been hiding out for the last 15 years. You can find Dylan's Oscar acceptance speech on the web, along with the set lists from his Australian dates and from every other tour. You can also unearth a tally of the dogs (mostly large and fierce) owned and, it's alleged, apparently abandoned by the bard, and, on a site called Tangled Up In Jews, an account of where he celebrated Passover throughout the Eighties. Increasingly, Dylan studies are a matter of niche marketing; next month, for example, Bloomsbury issues David Hadju's Positively Fourth Street, a book devoted to the formative years on the Greenwich Village folk scene. Grand overviews of Dylan's sprawling, inconsistent career, from its roots in small-town Minnesota to the present, are harder to come by. One is confined to Clinton Heylin's recently updated Behind the Shades, now issued in paperback, and this new volume from Howard Sounes, whose previous books were biographies of the murderers Fred and Rose West and the writer Charles Bukowski. In Down the Highway, Sounes pulls off several revelatory coups, chief among them that in 1986 Dylan secretly married Carolyn Dennis, one of his backing singers, after she had added a sixth child, Desiree, to the five from his first marriage to model Sara Lownds. The couple set up home in a bland bungalow close to the roar of LA's Ventura Boulevard, though neither this nor Dylan's aggressive religiosity stopped him maintaining a series of other love affairs, such as that with label executive Carole Childs, who was also set up with a Beverly Hills home. If the apparent duplicity of his tangled love life is one reason for Dylan's secrecy, obsessive fans are another. After John Lennon's murder, and a series of stalking incidents, he purchased a bulletproof vest, and Sounes suggests that the list of problematic individuals held by Dylan's security staff currently runs to some 500 names. Endlessly bootlegged, his garbage ransacked, his every move scrutinised by an army of Bobaholics, it's small wonder Dylan says simply: 'Like most famous people, I want to be left alone.' Fat chance. Sounes put in three years and 250 interviews to produce Down the Highway, though the great man himself predictably declined to contribute. Engagingly written and scrupulously researched, it proves a sympathetic but never fawning account which moves evenly through Dylan's career; too evenly, since the comings and goings of years on the road are never going to yield the cultural payback of his mercurial Sixties. At a third longer, Heylin's book arguably offers more insight into the elusive psyche of one of pop's few bona fide geniuses. Yet it's Sounes who unravels Dylan's shrouded romantic life and business affairs more satisfactorily. He pries open the bitter legal battle between the singer and his former manager, Albert Grossman (resolved only after Grossman's death in 1986) and reveals the ruthless streak required of any star who wants to avoid being asset-stripped by the rapacious music business. Neither author, however, can explain just why Dylan, having gained control of his catalogue, should choose to let 'The Times They Are a Changing' become an advertising jingle for both the Bank of Montreal and the accountancy firm, Coopers and Lybrand. Sheer contrariness seems to be the best explanation, together with Dylan's distaste for the 'Voice of a Generation' tag foisted on him during his protest years. Dylan's perversity is a recurring theme. His various bands have all had to get used to his playing unannounced numbers in undeclared keys, to being roundly ignored when not on stage and to being summarily dismissed. Sounes is weakest where Dylan is at his strongest. The majestic trilogy of 1960s albums at the heart of Dylan's reputation - Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde, records which redefined the art of popular song - slip past unilluminated. Rarely does either book drive one to the source of all the wonder, the music itself, or offer a glimpse of its resonance.",

      "body": "<p>When a girl is tired of London, it's time to head for New York - where you get more city per square mile, the brunches are longer, the shoes cheaper, the martinis bigger and the men... well, more of that later. </p> <p>On a cold, drizzly London morning, I fight my way through the London rush-hour traffic to Heathrow with a half-empty suitcase and a few well-chosen friends. Seven hours later, we are fighting our way through the rush-hour traffic on a cold, drizzly New York afternoon. But because we don't live here and because we don't have to get up for work tomorrow and because dollars might as well be Monopoly money the grey skies can't dampen our spirits. </p> <p>This is my second trip to New York which takes the pressure off as far as sightseeing is concerned. And as we have decided that we are emphatically not tourists, a hotel is, of course, out of the question. For our brief sojourn, we will live like the natives, in an apartment. </p> <p> <strong> When does a brunch become lunch?</strong> </p> <p> If you are going to live in an apartment, you have to buy things like milk and bread for breakfast. Until you grasp this fact (it took us two days), there is always brunch. Brunch is great because it allows you to eat a fried breakfast the right side of 11.30am (that is, after it) and no one will raise an eyebrow if you order a bloody Mary to go with it. It is also a fantastic opportunity to experience some of Manhattan's most fashionable restaurants without booking weeks ahead and still see some change from a $50 bill. Pastis, for example, has been packing them into the Meatpacking District (which at the time of going to press was New York's most upwardly mobile neighbourhood but will probably be very old hat by the time you read this). It is far too cool to take reservations and people will happily wait two hours for a table to rub shoulders with well-groomed regulars such as Sarah Jessica Parker. But on a weekday morning the staff might actually be glad to see you. With the aid of a few carafes of house red, our brunch seeps into lunch and the tables fill up around us. While earnest media execs discuss brand values, we get down to the much more serious business of discussing the pros and cons of plastic surgery. </p> <p> <strong> Do blondes really have more fun?</strong> </p> <p> I don't rate the New York department stores that highly. A hosiery department looks pretty much the same the world over. For shopping with a bit of local flavour, you'll need to get off Fifth Avenue and head downtown to the boutiques of Soho, the West Village or Nolita (the name given to the warren of streets just north of Little Italy). </p> <p>After an embarrassing struggle with a shop door on Mott Street (in this area, all the shops have entry buzzers), I am sprinkled with rose water by a beautiful nymph wearing a bindi and ordered to 'enjoy'. Be warned: these shops may look like kooky little neighbourhood boutiques but there's nothing kooky about the prices. I try on a couple of dresses which seemed to be made out of gossamer and held together with cobweb. The only thing of any substance is the price tag - $600! I find my karma strangely unbalanced and head for the door. Luckily, there is no shortage of second-hand stores in this part of town where you'll find vintage designer dresses, beaded handbags and Manolo Blahniks for under $200. </p> <p>No cash was spilt, however, until we got to Soho where it all suddenly went horribly wrong for Kate and Alex. Venus is an emporium of all things kitsch owned by Sex and the City stylist Patricia Field. Leopardskin G-strings, diamant\u00e9 tiaras, fake furs in tangerine and lime; our credit cards were safe here, or so we thought. But we hadn't reckoned on Alton O. Spot, wig stylist to the stars. Within minutes of entering the shop, Kate and Alex had been lured into his salon at the back of the shop and were being fitted out with tumbling tresses in deep mahogany and Titian hues. We left that shop with less money but considerably more hair than when we went in. Back at the apartment we swap wigs and discuss the etiquette of synthetic hair, including the thorny issue of at what point in the evening you reveal to your date that those locks he is caressing come with their own box and a set of care instructions. </p> <p> <strong> What to wear and other sticky issues</strong> </p> <p> There's nothing like a few days pounding the mean streets of Manhattan to take the roses out of your cheeks. I decide to treat myself to a pick-me-up at one of New York's hippest spas, Bliss. The treatment list is mindboggling. Skipping anything with the word blast or peel in it, I opt for the carrot and sesame body buff. I am shown into a 'wet-room' where I am drizzled with warm milk and honey, massaged with grated carrot, wrapped in foil and baked for 20 minutes. I am then rubbed briskly with sea salt and sesame seeds, glazed with lemon and thyme oil, garnished with parsley (I made that bit up) and returned to the 'robe-room' to recover. I help myself to the free buffet of chilled cucumber and float out to meet the girls who are eager to hear about my adventure. 'I do a fish dish like that,' observes Alex. </p> <p>Buffed and fragrant, I am ready to hit the town. But confronting the options for a night out in New York is like walking into a deli with a 30ft-long counter. The choice can be overwhelming and, unless you know what you want before you go in, you can end up walking out with a cheese and tomato sandwich. An Ayurvedic meal in Alphabet City, jazz in Greenwich Village, a poetry recital in the East Village or a sak\u00e9 tasting in Soho? Or we could just go for a pizza. Guidebooks are brandished, suggestions trampled on, tempers frayed before a decision is reached. Eventually we emerge from the apartment leaving a trail of teacups, scattered guide books, discarded clothes and wet towels behind us. </p> <p>There are many different ways to kickstart a night out in Manhattan: champagne in the lobby of the Algonquin Hotel; cocktails in the classy Campbell Apartment at Grand Central station and unnecessarily large martinis in the swanky Fifty Seven Fifty Seven piano bar at the Four Seasons are just a few of the methods we tried and tested. </p> <p>One night Steph and I find ourselves gatecrashing a college poetry society reunion. In a tiny East Village bar, a lawyer called Peter wearing braces and a Burberry scarf recites the first 25 stanzas of Beowulf , in perfect Middle English. We try to look suitably impressed. As we say our goodbyes, he slips us a business card and tell us to look up his website. When we get back to London there is an email waiting for us from Peter. 'Thanks for a great evening. It was spontaneous and fun which is what New York should be.' Indeed.</p> <p><strong>Rent the apartment, join the gang</strong></p> <p>Want to get a slice of the Sex and the City lifestyle? You won't get an invite to the gang if you're clutching your hotel-room key while bar-hopping. The only way to get under the skin of a city is to rent an apartment and live like the locals do. In a city such as New York, where you'd be lucky to get a hotel room for under $100 a night, it can even save you money, especially if you are travelling with a group of friends or family. </p> <p>There are an increasing number of agencies which specialise in subletting properties to tourists on a short-term basis. <a href=\"http://www.nyhabitat.com\">New York Habitat's website</a> displays floor plans, pictures and detailed descriptions of more than 3,000 properties ranging from furnished studios at $85 a week to chic three-bedroom West Side apartments for $6,000.</p> <p>As well as full kitchen facilities, practically all the apartments come with television, videos, stereos and books while the most luxurious have shared gyms and swimming-pools.</p> <p>But renting an apartment comes with certain responsibilities that visitors should bear in mind: the role of many agencies ends once contact has been made between visitor and homeowner, leaving owners free to impose their personal house rules on their guests. These rules can be as harmless as asking guests to water plants or collect the mail but there is nothing to stop them demanding more onerous duties, such as washing all sheets and towels before leaving.</p> <p>A good halfway house between an apartment and a hotel is a suite hotel. <a href=\"http://www.mesuite.com\">Manhattan East Suite Hotels</a> offers self-catering apartments with room service, doormen and a concierge on call.

      "bodyText": "When a girl is tired of London, it's time to head for New York - where you get more city per square mile, the brunches are longer, the shoes cheaper, the martinis bigger and the men... well, more of that later. On a cold, drizzly London morning, I fight my way through the London rush-hour traffic to Heathrow with a half-empty suitcase and a few well-chosen friends. Seven hours later, we are fighting our way through the rush-hour traffic on a cold, drizzly New York afternoon. But because we don't live here and because we don't have to get up for work tomorrow and because dollars might as well be Monopoly money the grey skies can't dampen our spirits. This is my second trip to New York which takes the pressure off as far as sightseeing is concerned. And as we have decided that we are emphatically not tourists, a hotel is, of course, out of the question. For our brief sojourn, we will live like the natives, in an apartment. When does a brunch become lunch? If you are going to live in an apartment, you have to buy things like milk and bread for breakfast. Until you grasp this fact (it took us two days), there is always brunch. Brunch is great because it allows you to eat a fried breakfast the right side of 11.30am (that is, after it) and no one will raise an eyebrow if you order a bloody Mary to go with it. It is also a fantastic opportunity to experience some of Manhattan's most fashionable restaurants without booking weeks ahead and still see some change from a $50 bill. Pastis, for example, has been packing them into the Meatpacking District (which at the time of going to press was New York's most upwardly mobile neighbourhood but will probably be very old hat by the time you read this). It is far too cool to take reservations and people will happily wait two hours for a table to rub shoulders with well-groomed regulars such as Sarah Jessica Parker. But on a weekday morning the staff might actually be glad to see you. With the aid of a few carafes of house red, our brunch seeps into lunch and the tables fill up around us. While earnest media execs discuss brand values, we get down to the much more serious business of discussing the pros and cons of plastic surgery. Do blondes really have more fun? I don't rate the New York department stores that highly. A hosiery department looks pretty much the same the world over. For shopping with a bit of local flavour, you'll need to get off Fifth Avenue and head downtown to the boutiques of Soho, the West Village or Nolita (the name given to the warren of streets just north of Little Italy). After an embarrassing struggle with a shop door on Mott Street (in this area, all the shops have entry buzzers), I am sprinkled with rose water by a beautiful nymph wearing a bindi and ordered to 'enjoy'. Be warned: these shops may look like kooky little neighbourhood boutiques but there's nothing kooky about the prices. I try on a couple of dresses which seemed to be made out of gossamer and held together with cobweb. The only thing of any substance is the price tag - $600! I find my karma strangely unbalanced and head for the door. Luckily, there is no shortage of second-hand stores in this part of town where you'll find vintage designer dresses, beaded handbags and Manolo Blahniks for under $200. No cash was spilt, however, until we got to Soho where it all suddenly went horribly wrong for Kate and Alex. Venus is an emporium of all things kitsch owned by Sex and the City stylist Patricia Field. Leopardskin G-strings, diamant\u00e9 tiaras, fake furs in tangerine and lime; our credit cards were safe here, or so we thought. But we hadn't reckoned on Alton O. Spot, wig stylist to the stars. Within minutes of entering the shop, Kate and Alex had been lured into his salon at the back of the shop and were being fitted out with tumbling tresses in deep mahogany and Titian hues. We left that shop with less money but considerably more hair than when we went in. Back at the apartment we swap wigs and discuss the etiquette of synthetic hair, including the thorny issue of at what point in the evening you reveal to your date that those locks he is caressing come with their own box and a set of care instructions. What to wear and other sticky issues There's nothing like a few days pounding the mean streets of Manhattan to take the roses out of your cheeks. I decide to treat myself to a pick-me-up at one of New York's hippest spas, Bliss. The treatment list is mindboggling. Skipping anything with the word blast or peel in it, I opt for the carrot and sesame body buff. I am shown into a 'wet-room' where I am drizzled with warm milk and honey, massaged with grated carrot, wrapped in foil and baked for 20 minutes. I am then rubbed briskly with sea salt and sesame seeds, glazed with lemon and thyme oil, garnished with parsley (I made that bit up) and returned to the 'robe-room' to recover. I help myself to the free buffet of chilled cucumber and float out to meet the girls who are eager to hear about my adventure. 'I do a fish dish like that,' observes Alex. Buffed and fragrant, I am ready to hit the town. But confronting the options for a night out in New York is like walking into a deli with a 30ft-long counter. The choice can be overwhelming and, unless you know what you want before you go in, you can end up walking out with a cheese and tomato sandwich. An Ayurvedic meal in Alphabet City, jazz in Greenwich Village, a poetry recital in the East Village or a sak\u00e9 tasting in Soho? Or we could just go for a pizza. Guidebooks are brandished, suggestions trampled on, tempers frayed before a decision is reached. Eventually we emerge from the apartment leaving a trail of teacups, scattered guide books, discarded clothes and wet towels behind us. There are many different ways to kickstart a night out in Manhattan: champagne in the lobby of the Algonquin Hotel; cocktails in the classy Campbell Apartment at Grand Central station and unnecessarily large martinis in the swanky Fifty Seven Fifty Seven piano bar at the Four Seasons are just a few of the methods we tried and tested. One night Steph and I find ourselves gatecrashing a college poetry society reunion. In a tiny East Village bar, a lawyer called Peter wearing braces and a Burberry scarf recites the first 25 stanzas of Beowulf , in perfect Middle English. We try to look suitably impressed. As we say our goodbyes, he slips us a business card and tell us to look up his website. When we get back to London there is an email waiting for us from Peter. 'Thanks for a great evening. It was spontaneous and fun which is what New York should be.' Indeed. Rent the apartment, join the gang Want to get a slice of the Sex and the City lifestyle? You won't get an invite to the gang if you're clutching your hotel-room key while bar-hopping. The only way to get under the skin of a city is to rent an apartment and live like the locals do. In a city such as New York, where you'd be lucky to get a hotel room for under $100 a night, it can even save you money, especially if you are travelling with a group of friends or family. There are an increasing number of agencies which specialise in subletting properties to tourists on a short-term basis. New York Habitat's website displays floor plans, pictures and detailed descriptions of more than 3,000 properties ranging from furnished studios at $85 a week to chic three-bedroom West Side apartments for $6,000. As well as full kitchen facilities, practically all the apartments come with television, videos, stereos and books while the most luxurious have shared gyms and swimming-pools. But renting an apartment comes with certain responsibilities that visitors should bear in mind: the role of many agencies ends once contact has been made between visitor and homeowner, leaving owners free to impose their personal house rules on their guests. These rules can be as harmless as asking guests to water plants or collect the mail but there is nothing to stop them demanding more onerous duties, such as washing all sheets and towels before leaving. A good halfway house between an apartment and a hotel is a suite hotel. Manhattan East Suite Hotels offers self-catering apartments with room service, doormen and a concierge on call. The company has 10 properties in Manhattan's stylish East Side and Midtown with prices from $250 a week. A separate living area, kitchen and laundry/dry-cleaning services come as standard while the most luxurious properties include gardens and Jacuzzis. Some UK tour operators offer apartments as an alternative to hotels for short- break visitors. America As You Like It has around 500 privately-owned apartments on its books, sleeping from two to eight people.

I hope that begins to happen on Thursday for U Tin Win. But he is what he has been since 1989, a prisoner of Burma's unrelenting military dictators. Count three (for 3 May) and pray. </p> <p>U Tin Win used to edit the Hanthawati Times and campaign for democracy, of which press freedom is an umbilical part. He knowingly courted personal disaster; it duly arrived. He was sentenced to 12 years in jail, then had another eight added, with almost casual brutality, when he was found with a pen and paper in his cell. He languishes now, health broken, behind locked doors at Rangoon general hospital. The generals say they will let him out if he recants and falls silent. He suffers, but he stays. </p> <p>My jury, 14 journalists from around the globe, meets once a year at Unesco headquarters in Paris to choose the Guillermo Cano prizewinner for World Press Freedom Day. It is, simultaneously, a dispiriting and inspiring task. </p> <p>Cano (a brave Colombian editor) was gunned down by drug cartel assassins and his family give the prize in his memory. Sometimes - for Christina Anyanwu in Nigeria or Gao Yu in China - winning helps and their prison doors open. Sometimes even the clout of Unesco brings no instant relief. Nizar Nayyouf, going blind in a Syrian military jail, won it last year. Assad the Elder is dead and Assad the supposedly Younger and More Liberal has taken over, but Nayyouf is still wretchedly behind bars and renewing a hunger strike which will surely kill him. Again - a recurring theme - he can go free if he shuts up. He will do no such thing. </p> <p>What's dispiriting about this jury? The impossibility of choosing between murdered editors in the Congo and murdered reporters in Cyprus, between gallant Serbs who fought the good fight against Milosevic and survived and Burma's legions of the lost. Any individual choice - of the living over the dead, the victors over the vanquished - seems to diminish the whole. Yet inspiration also holds sway. </p> <p>Here we sit in grubby old Britain, wriggling over the News of the World, and we lose all perspective. We forget what journalism, at heart, is about. It is not about Sophie's slip showing or Posh's new boob job; not about share-tipping or celebrity-mongering: the journalism of Nayyouf and U Tin Win is about raising voices and turning over stones. A brave and necessary trade. </p> <p>I haven't met U Tin Win, but I feel that I know him because I know U Thaung, a Burmese brother in blood and ink. Almost 45 years ago, he started Kyemon, which became Burma's best-selling paper overnight. The generals came; the editor went to prison; his paper 'nationalised' into acquiescence. </p> <p>Now he lives in exile in America, writing constantly - 26 books - about the beloved country he cries for.

      "bodyText": "Some awards juries are different. The one I sit on - the one I wouldn't miss - has a special power and a special pull. Sometimes it can get people - innocent people - out of prison. I hope that begins to happen on Thursday for U Tin Win. But he is what he has been since 1989, a prisoner of Burma's unrelenting military dictators. Count three (for 3 May) and pray. U Tin Win used to edit the Hanthawati Times and campaign for democracy, of which press freedom is an umbilical part. He knowingly courted personal disaster; it duly arrived. He was sentenced to 12 years in jail, then had another eight added, with almost casual brutality, when he was found with a pen and paper in his cell. He languishes now, health broken, behind locked doors at Rangoon general hospital. The generals say they will let him out if he recants and falls silent. He suffers, but he stays. My jury, 14 journalists from around the globe, meets once a year at Unesco headquarters in Paris to choose the Guillermo Cano prizewinner for World Press Freedom Day. It is, simultaneously, a dispiriting and inspiring task. Cano (a brave Colombian editor) was gunned down by drug cartel assassins and his family give the prize in his memory. Sometimes - for Christina Anyanwu in Nigeria or Gao Yu in China - winning helps and their prison doors open. Sometimes even the clout of Unesco brings no instant relief. Nizar Nayyouf, going blind in a Syrian military jail, won it last year. Assad the Elder is dead and Assad the supposedly Younger and More Liberal has taken over, but Nayyouf is still wretchedly behind bars and renewing a hunger strike which will surely kill him. Again - a recurring theme - he can go free if he shuts up. He will do no such thing. What's dispiriting about this jury? The impossibility of choosing between murdered editors in the Congo and murdered reporters in Cyprus, between gallant Serbs who fought the good fight against Milosevic and survived and Burma's legions of the lost. Any individual choice - of the living over the dead, the victors over the vanquished - seems to diminish the whole. Yet inspiration also holds sway. Here we sit in grubby old Britain, wriggling over the News of the World, and we lose all perspective. We forget what journalism, at heart, is about. It is not about Sophie's slip showing or Posh's new boob job; not about share-tipping or celebrity-mongering: the journalism of Nayyouf and U Tin Win is about raising voices and turning over stones. A brave and necessary trade. I haven't met U Tin Win, but I feel that I know him because I know U Thaung, a Burmese brother in blood and ink. Almost 45 years ago, he started Kyemon, which became Burma's best-selling paper overnight. The generals came; the editor went to prison; his paper 'nationalised' into acquiescence. Now he lives in exile in America, writing constantly - 26 books - about the beloved country he cries for. And the striking thing about U Thaung, face to face, is how modest and quiet and calm he is. He endures. Burma's democratic government (in exile, too) doesn't count him an unquestioning friend because he sticks to no party line. He is a prisoner of his own conscience. That is also the simple truth about so many editors and writers the world over who stand beside U Tin Win and U Thaung as a constantly endangered species - Pius Njawe from the Ivory Coast, Fred M'membe from Zambia, Savea Sano Malifa of Samoa, Daoud Kuttab from Palestine. There is no end, month after month, to the roll of those who must be included. The freedom day on 3 May arrives, as always, bulwarked by reports and statistics. Has Africa (despite Zimbabwe) edged forward in the decade since Unesco's Windhoek declaration of the rights of independent journalism there? Is Russia slipping back into repression?

      "body": "<p>As his fortune grew and his fame spread, Pablo began tending his public image, conscientiously denying any official connection to his illicit enterprises and working hard to appear likable, although his reputation terrified even hardened Medell\u00edn criminals. Employing leftist rhetoric when it suited his needs, Pablo played upon popular resentments of the established powers in Bogot\u00e1 and the historical hard feelings toward the United States. Surrounded by bodyguards and worshipful associates, he had begun to see himself differently. It wasn't enough any more to have succeeded on the streets of Medell\u00edn or to dominate the international drug trade; somewhere along the way Pablo had begun to see himself as a great man.</p> <p>Politics was the next logical step. In 1978, he was elected as a substitute city council member in Medell\u00edn. He helped underwrite the presidential campaign of Belisario Betancur that year, loaning the campaign planes and helicopters, and also contributed liberally to the campaign of Betancur's rival, Julio Turbay, who won the election.</p> <p>Two years later, Pablo backed the formation of a new national political movement, called the New Liberal Party, headed locally by former justice minister Alberto Santofimio and nationally by the enormously popular reformer Luis Gal\u00e1n. In 1982, he ran for Congress himself. He stood as a substitute for Envigado representative Jairo Ortega. Under the Colombian system, voters elect a representative and a substitute, who is allowed full privileges of the office and sits in when the primary delegate is unable to attend congressional sessions. Ortega and Pablo were elected in the same balloting that elevated Betancur, on his second try, to the presidency.</p> <p>So Pablo Escobar was a congressman. It was just a substitute position, but the victory seemed precisely the validation he had sought. He was now officially a respectable citizen, a representative of the people. The post conferred automatic judicial immunity, so Pablo could no longer be prosecuted for crimes under Colombian law. He was also entitled to a diplomatic visa, which he began using that year to take trips with his family to the United States. He posed in front of the White House with his young son, Juan Pablo, and began enjoying for the first time the mansions he had purchased for himself in Miami. Pablo had arrived. He told his friends that he intended some day soon to be the president of Colombia.</p> <p>At this time, he went to great lengths to erase evidence of his more sordid criminal past (while still flaunting it in private), and undertook an aggressive campaign to be seen as a benevolent, law-abiding citizen. He hired publicists and paid off journalists.</p> <p>He founded his own newspaper, Medell\u00edn Civico, which produced occasional fawning profiles of its benefactor. 'Yes, I remember him,' one Escobar admirer said in its pages. 'His hands, almost priest-like, drawing parabolas of friendship and generosity in the air. Yes, I know him, his eyes weeping because there is not enough bread for all the nation's dinner tables. I have watched his tortured feelings when he sees street children - angels without toys, without a present, without a future.' Pablo sponsored art exhibitions to raise money for charity and founded Medell\u00edn Without Slums, an organisation that sought to continue his housing programmes for the poor. He took walking tours of the city slums with two local priests, whose friendship implied the blessings of the church. The only hint of Pablo's personal agenda in this civic outreach was a forum he sponsored on the subject of extradition at a popular bar and disco in Medell\u00edn called Kevin's.</p> <p>Colombia had signed a treaty with the United States in 1979 that recognised the shipment of illegal drugs to be a crime against the United States. As such, it called for suspected drug traffickers to be extradited for trial to the United States, and, if convicted, imprisoned. The prospect struck fear into the hearts of men such as Pablo Escobar, who long ago had learned they had little to fear from Colombia's justice system. Not surprisingly, Pablo's forum on extradition denounced the practice as a violation of 'national sovereignty'. He made banning extradition a point of nationalist pride, and the centrepiece of his political agenda.</p> <p>With his election, Pablo became a popular public figure. To an increasingly admiring Bogot\u00e1 press, he became Colombia's own Robin Hood. In April 1983, the magazine Semana profiled him warmly, noting only that the sources of his wealth 'never cease to be the object of speculation'. Waving his diamond-and-gold Rolex, admitting to his ownership of a fleet of planes and helicopters and vast real-estate holdings worldwide, in the article Pablo traced the origin of his estimated $5bn fortune to a 'bicycle rental business' which he said he had started in Medell\u00edn when he was 16 years old. 'I dedicated some years to the lottery, then I got into the business of buying and selling cars, and finally, I ended up in property.' It was, of course, preposterous. He was infamous worldwide in law-enforcement circles as a cocaine trafficker.</p> <p>Pablo was much more than a rich smuggler; he embodied the youthful spirit of the age. Throughout the civilised world, a new generation was coming of age, one that had strikingly different attitudes toward recreational drug use than its parents had. The illegality of these popular drugs was part of their appeal. Using them was an act of defiance, an assertion of hipness. Whether they thought about it or not, everyone who snorted cocaine was executing a small bow to their intrepid Colombian suppliers. Just as Pablo's billions were the sum total of every furtive transaction, his risk was the sum total of all his users' petty risks. At the end of the long chain of illicit commerce that delivered the numbing substance to their nasal membranes, Pablo ran the Big Risk and reaped the Big Reward.</p> <p>He and the other narco kingpins were, at least for this brief period, popular heroes, the embodiment of cool, as glamorous as they were dangerous in pop-culture portrayals such as the TV programme Miami Vice. In real life, Pablo played his role with panache. He would proudly point out to visitors at N\u00e1poles the small plane that had flown his first shipments of the drug, mounted over the entrance to his estate. He built small, remote-controlled submarines that could carry up to 2,000kg of cocaine from the northern coast of Colombia to waters off Puerto Rico, where divers would remove the shipment and transport it to Miami in speedboats. He would send fleets of planes north, each carrying 1,000kg. There was no way customs and law enforcement would intercept more than a tiny fraction. Eventually he was buying used Boeing 727s, stripping out the passenger seats, and loading as much as 10,000kg per flight. There was nothing to stop him. Or so it seemed.</p> <p>In response to a growing epidemic of cocaine use in America, President Ronald Reagan had created a cabinet-level task force in January 1982 to co-ordinate the nation's efforts against drug smuggling. He had appointed Vice-president George Bush to lead it. It was not until Bush was elected president in 1988 that the US war on drugs would formally shift its emphasis from trying to stop drugs from crossing the borders to going after narco kingpins, but Bush began moving in this direction early on. The drug lords would eventually become not just law enforcement targets but military ones - an important distinction that the hunt for Pablo Escobar would make clear. Even though few who thought seriously about the drug problem believed it could be stopped or even curbed by arresting a few cartel bosses, it proved a lot easier to get the US Congress worked up about a cabal of billionaires infecting America's youth than about the amorphous smuggling problem. Marshaling public support for war, or even just war spending, requires enemies, and Colombian cocaine barons colourfully fit the description.</p> <p>During this same period, mainstream attitudes toward cocaine use in the United States underwent a dramatic shift. In June 1986, University of Maryland basketball star Len Bias, the number-one pick in the National Basketball Association draft, collapsed and died at a campus party after snorting cocaine. The decade-long flirtation with the white powder by affluent young Americans had begun to sour anyway, but Bias's death sealed it. Seemingly overnight, cocaine the harmless party drug became cocaine the killer. Suddenly the stories of wild parties and excesses in Hollywood showed a darker side, in stories of overdose and addiction. Cocaine lost all its stylishness when it started showing up on city streets in its cheap, smokeable form - crack. It was now a ravenous social epidemic, spurring petty crimes and destroying lives. Traffickers such as Pablo became not guides to the zeitgeist but criminals.</p> <p>For the rest of his life, with one brief respite, Pablo was at war with the state. At the centre of the struggle remained extradition, the one fate he feared more than any other - even death. He had proclaimed: 'Better a tomb in Colombia than a prison cell in the United States.' Death was his strategy against extradition, that and money. His policy of plata o plomo became so notoriously effective that it would ultimately threaten to undermine Colombia's democracy. Already, by the end of 1984, he was untouchable in Medell\u00edn. He moved openly around the city, attending bullfights and nightclubs, throwing parties at his estates, all the while officially a fugitive. Popular and powerful, he had clearly bought off the police and courts there. Anyone who considered standing up against him was marked for assassination.</p> <p>In the fall of 1985, Pablo offered to turn himself in if the government would promise not to extradite him to the United States. When it again refused, he settled in for a long fight. His lawyers (and sicarios - henchmen) chipped away at the cases against him. Recognising that its judicial system was stymied, Colombia did away with jury trials (people were too frightened to serve in any trial remotely related to drug trafficking) and began attempting to protect judges by hiding their identities. But often even these 'faceless' judges were gunned down. Pablo also tried in various ways to escape American justice. Betting that the United States had more interest in fighting Communists than narcos, his lawyers approached the US attorney general in 1986 with an offer to trade information against Communist guerrillas in return for amnesty from his drug crimes.</p> <p>With the offer, Pablo made a gesture. He betrayed his long-time cartel associate Carlos Lehder. Colombian police were tipped off to a party Lehder had planned for 4 February 1987. The colourful, eccentric cartel leader was arrested and immediately extradited, flown from Bogot\u00e1 to Tampa. Photographers were allowed to snap pictures of him in the back of the plane, wearing combat boots, sweatpants and a striped shirt, looking resigned and oddly bemused as he waited to depart. He would be sentenced to 135 years in prison in the US.</p> <p>Still, America was not interested in making a deal with Pablo Escobar. It was a sign of how seriously the Reagan administration was taking the drug problem. In April 1986, the President had signed National Security Decision Directive 221, which for the first time declared drug trafficking a threat to national security. The directive opened the door to direct military involvement in the war on drugs, which was placing a growing emphasis on attacking the crops, labs, and traffickers in Central and South America. This was an unprecedented mixing of law enforcement and military missions, and Reagan directed that any American laws or regulations prohibiting such an alliance were to be reinterpreted or amended.</p> <p>Inside Colombia, Pablo kept upping the ante. In December his sicarios killed the former chief of the nation's counter narcotics police and two legislators who had spoken out in favour of extradition. In January 1987, the former minister of justice, now the Colombian ambassador to Hungary, was stopped in a snowstorm in Budapest and shot five times in the face. He survived. Andr\u00e9s Pastrana, the journalist son of a former president and Conservative candidate for mayor of Bogot\u00e1, was kidnapped, and a week later Attorney General Carlos Hoyos was killed in a hail of machine-gun fire in Medell\u00edn. A caller to a local radio station announced Hoyos's 'execution' and called him 'a traitor and a sellout'.</p> <p>When a judge prepared to indict Pablo for a murder, he received a note from a group calling itself the 'Extraditables'. 'We are friends of Pablo Escobar and we are ready to do anything for him\u0085 We know perfectly well that not even the slightest evidence exists against Mr Escobar. We want to remind you that you are making a big mistake\u0085 We are capable of executing you at any place on this planet\u0085 in the meantime, you will see the fall, one by one, of all the members of your family. We advise you to rethink, for later you will have no time for regrets\u0085 For calling Mr Escobar to trial, you will remain without forebears or descendants in your genealogical tree.'</p> <p>By the end of 1987, there were killings in the news almost every day in Bogot\u00e1. The new US ambassador, Charles Gillespie, began warning Washington that the escalating violence in Colombia was threatening to topple the state. Through it all, Pablo orchestrated the war in relative peace, living with defiant openness in Envigado.</p> <p>Pablo was usually tipped off well in advance of any effort to arrest him, and he had homes scattered throughout the mountainous Medell\u00edn area, but now and then the police achieved enough surprise to catch him, literally, with his pants down. In March of that year, about 1,000 national police officers raided one of his mansions in the mountains outside Medell\u00edn. They arrived in helicopters and in tanks and encircled the area. Pablo fled in his underwear, avoiding the police cordon on foot.</p> <p>However, by 1989 the scaffolding of Pablo's once fearful organisation was shaky. Nothing he was doing worked. He had bombed or bribed just about every official in Colombia, but it was clear no one in Bogot\u00e1 was going to cut a deal that would jeopardise all-important ties with the United States government. So Pablo began trying to work some influence in Washington. He had tried to retain a lobbying firm managed by Henry Kissinger in an effort to influence the Reagan administration, and he retained a lawyer who worked in the same firm as Jeb Bush, son of the president-elect, hoping to eventually persuade the younger Bush to approach his father. Both efforts failed.</p> <p>The future did not look bright. The Liberal Party candidate for president, Luis Gal\u00e1n, was wildly popular and certain to be elected in 1990. Gal\u00e1n was a charismatic 46-year-old reformer who had become a fearlessly outspoken enemy of the cartel. He had vowed to rid Colombia of drug traffickers, and he made no secret of his desire to ship them off to the United States for trial and imprisonment. His election threatened to undo all the progress Pablo had made by cowing and corrupting the Colombian judiciary. Gal\u00e1n was the nation's darling at that moment.</p> <p>On 18 August, a sicario with an Uzi submachine gun shot down Gal\u00e1n as he made a campaign speech before supporters in Soacha, a town southwest of Bogot\u00e1. Three months later, in an effort to kill Gal\u00e1n's successor, candidate C\u00e9sar Gaviria, Escobar's men planted a bomb on an Avianca airliner, blowing it out of the sky. One hundred and ten people were killed, including two Americans. It was an act of audacious cruelty with implications beyond any that Pablo had imagined.</p> <p>These two atrocities would prove to be fatal mistakes. They made Pablo enemies who were far more powerful than any he had faced before. Downing a commercial airliner was an attack on global civilisation. It meant Pablo now posed a direct threat to American citizens, which meant, as we shall see, that some in the Bush administration believed he could be legally targeted for assassination. Killing Gal\u00e1n had made Pablo public enemy number one in Colombia. The Avianca bombing made him public enemy number one in the world. By the end of the summer of 1989, Pablo Escobar was 40 years old. He was one of the richest men in the world, and perhaps its most infamous criminal. No longer just a law-enforcement target, he was now a military target. To the men of America's secret counterterrorism community, the ruthless doper from Medell\u00edn had become a clear and present danger.</p> <p>\u0095 Next week: in our second extract, the net finally closes in around Pablo Escobar.

      "bodyText": "As his fortune grew and his fame spread, Pablo began tending his public image, conscientiously denying any official connection to his illicit enterprises and working hard to appear likable, although his reputation terrified even hardened Medell\u00edn criminals. Employing leftist rhetoric when it suited his needs, Pablo played upon popular resentments of the established powers in Bogot\u00e1 and the historical hard feelings toward the United States. Surrounded by bodyguards and worshipful associates, he had begun to see himself differently. It wasn't enough any more to have succeeded on the streets of Medell\u00edn or to dominate the international drug trade; somewhere along the way Pablo had begun to see himself as a great man. Politics was the next logical step. In 1978, he was elected as a substitute city council member in Medell\u00edn. He helped underwrite the presidential campaign of Belisario Betancur that year, loaning the campaign planes and helicopters, and also contributed liberally to the campaign of Betancur's rival, Julio Turbay, who won the election. Two years later, Pablo backed the formation of a new national political movement, called the New Liberal Party, headed locally by former justice minister Alberto Santofimio and nationally by the enormously popular reformer Luis Gal\u00e1n. In 1982, he ran for Congress himself. He stood as a substitute for Envigado representative Jairo Ortega. Under the Colombian system, voters elect a representative and a substitute, who is allowed full privileges of the office and sits in when the primary delegate is unable to attend congressional sessions. Ortega and Pablo were elected in the same balloting that elevated Betancur, on his second try, to the presidency. So Pablo Escobar was a congressman. It was just a substitute position, but the victory seemed precisely the validation he had sought. He was now officially a respectable citizen, a representative of the people. The post conferred automatic judicial immunity, so Pablo could no longer be prosecuted for crimes under Colombian law. He was also entitled to a diplomatic visa, which he began using that year to take trips with his family to the United States. He posed in front of the White House with his young son, Juan Pablo, and began enjoying for the first time the mansions he had purchased for himself in Miami. Pablo had arrived. He told his friends that he intended some day soon to be the president of Colombia. At this time, he went to great lengths to erase evidence of his more sordid criminal past (while still flaunting it in private), and undertook an aggressive campaign to be seen as a benevolent, law-abiding citizen. He hired publicists and paid off journalists. He founded his own newspaper, Medell\u00edn Civico, which produced occasional fawning profiles of its benefactor. 'Yes, I remember him,' one Escobar admirer said in its pages. 'His hands, almost priest-like, drawing parabolas of friendship and generosity in the air. Yes, I know him, his eyes weeping because there is not enough bread for all the nation's dinner tables. I have watched his tortured feelings when he sees street children - angels without toys, without a present, without a future.' Pablo sponsored art exhibitions to raise money for charity and founded Medell\u00edn Without Slums, an organisation that sought to continue his housing programmes for the poor. He took walking tours of the city slums with two local priests, whose friendship implied the blessings of the church. The only hint of Pablo's personal agenda in this civic outreach was a forum he sponsored on the subject of extradition at a popular bar and disco in Medell\u00edn called Kevin's. Colombia had signed a treaty with the United States in 1979 that recognised the shipment of illegal drugs to be a crime against the United States. As such, it called for suspected drug traffickers to be extradited for trial to the United States, and, if convicted, imprisoned. The prospect struck fear into the hearts of men such as Pablo Escobar, who long ago had learned they had little to fear from Colombia's justice system. Not surprisingly, Pablo's forum on extradition denounced the practice as a violation of 'national sovereignty'. He made banning extradition a point of nationalist pride, and the centrepiece of his political agenda. With his election, Pablo became a popular public figure. To an increasingly admiring Bogot\u00e1 press, he became Colombia's own Robin Hood. In April 1983, the magazine Semana profiled him warmly, noting only that the sources of his wealth 'never cease to be the object of speculation'. Waving his diamond-and-gold Rolex, admitting to his ownership of a fleet of planes and helicopters and vast real-estate holdings worldwide, in the article Pablo traced the origin of his estimated $5bn fortune to a 'bicycle rental business' which he said he had started in Medell\u00edn when he was 16 years old. 'I dedicated some years to the lottery, then I got into the business of buying and selling cars, and finally, I ended up in property.' It was, of course, preposterous. He was infamous worldwide in law-enforcement circles as a cocaine trafficker. Pablo was much more than a rich smuggler; he embodied the youthful spirit of the age. Throughout the civilised world, a new generation was coming of age, one that had strikingly different attitudes toward recreational drug use than its parents had. The illegality of these popular drugs was part of their appeal. Using them was an act of defiance, an assertion of hipness. Whether they thought about it or not, everyone who snorted cocaine was executing a small bow to their intrepid Colombian suppliers. Just as Pablo's billions were the sum total of every furtive transaction, his risk was the sum total of all his users' petty risks. At the end of the long chain of illicit commerce that delivered the numbing substance to their nasal membranes, Pablo ran the Big Risk and reaped the Big Reward. He and the other narco kingpins were, at least for this brief period, popular heroes, the embodiment of cool, as glamorous as they were dangerous in pop-culture portrayals such as the TV programme Miami Vice. In real life, Pablo played his role with panache. He would proudly point out to visitors at N\u00e1poles the small plane that had flown his first shipments of the drug, mounted over the entrance to his estate. He built small, remote-controlled submarines that could carry up to 2,000kg of cocaine from the northern coast of Colombia to waters off Puerto Rico, where divers would remove the shipment and transport it to Miami in speedboats. He would send fleets of planes north, each carrying 1,000kg. There was no way customs and law enforcement would intercept more than a tiny fraction. Eventually he was buying used Boeing 727s, stripping out the passenger seats, and loading as much as 10,000kg per flight. There was nothing to stop him. Or so it seemed. In response to a growing epidemic of cocaine use in America, President Ronald Reagan had created a cabinet-level task force in January 1982 to co-ordinate the nation's efforts against drug smuggling. He had appointed Vice-president George Bush to lead it. It was not until Bush was elected president in 1988 that the US war on drugs would formally shift its emphasis from trying to stop drugs from crossing the borders to going after narco kingpins, but Bush began moving in this direction early on.

Even though few who thought seriously about the drug problem believed it could be stopped or even curbed by arresting a few cartel bosses, it proved a lot easier to get the US Congress worked up about a cabal of billionaires infecting America's youth than about the amorphous smuggling problem. Marshaling public support for war, or even just war spending, requires enemies, and Colombian cocaine barons colourfully fit the description. During this same period, mainstream attitudes toward cocaine use in the United States underwent a dramatic shift. In June 1986, University of Maryland basketball star Len Bias, the number-one pick in the National Basketball Association draft, collapsed and died at a campus party after snorting cocaine.

Traffickers such as Pablo became not guides to the zeitgeist but criminals. For the rest of his life, with one brief respite, Pablo was at war with the state. At the centre of the struggle remained extradition, the one fate he feared more than any other - even death. He had proclaimed: 'Better a tomb in Colombia than a prison cell in the United States.'

      "body": "<p>In the nineteen-fifties and 'sixties Sri Lanka, then known as Ceylon, had one of the most vibrant print media in the Asian region. The first attempt to curb the media in 1964 resulted in the incumbent government being overthrown when the Press Council Bill was defeated in Parliament.</p> <p>That unfortunately was the last victory for freedom of expression. Since then successive governments have systematically undermined freedom of expression as democracy itself came under threat. Independent publishing houses were either acquired by the government or closed down under emergency regulations. Electronic media has been kept under strict government control.</p> <p>The outbreak of the Tamil separatist war in 1983, gave the government an ideal reason to further tighten controls. The country has been run under emergency regulations for most of the past three decades - with censorship the norm rather than the exception.</p> <p>Intimidation of journalists and media owners, filing of criminal defamation cases against editors and publishers, restrictions on state advertising, and in extreme cases murder have all been used to silence the media.</p> <p>Reporting the separatist war, one of the bloodiest conflicts in the world, was relatively easy in the first decade. However the Sri Lanka government drew its own lessons from the restrictions imposed on the media by the western allies during the Gulf War. </p> <p>Severe restrictions have been imposed on journalists reporting from government areas of the north and east of the country,where the separatist war is been fought. Since 1995 access to rebel held areas has been totally denied with threats of serious actions under emergency regulations for any journalist who dared to break the ban. </p> <p>Strict censorship on local and foreign media during military debacles has left people in dark. Any news organization or journalist which report news adverse to the government is quickly branded as a rebel sympathiser by the powerful state owned print and electronic media which still has the biggest reach.</p> <p>Intense campaigning for media law reforms has been scuttled by the incumbent government fearing a free media would undermine its credibility by exposing widespread corruption, incompetence in governance and rigged elections.</p> <p>The Tamil separatist rebel organisation, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has been no less tolerant of the media. Journalists who criticise the organisation has been routinely murdered and journalists visiting rebel areas are under strict surveillance. </p> <p>Any criticism of the rebels by people living in the north and east is dealt with harshly. However, despite the odds, a section of media, especially the print media has continued to do exactly that. Editors and journalists have paid a high price for their courage. At least a dozen journalists have been murdered, some have fled the country and others face physical violence, or face court cases and well-orchestrated abuse by the state media. </p> <p>News organisations critical of the government often find private sector advertisers have been intimidated and state advertising banned. In the past few months, the government has used another weapon to increase pressure on the media. Taxes on newsprint have been increased by 15% at a time of high newsprint prices in the world market and pressure on advertising due to a serious economic downturn while the private electronic media is been threatened with massive increases in licence fees for transmitting stations. In Sri Lanka freedom of expression is facing perhaps its biggest threat since the island nation achieved independence from Britain in 1948. </p> <p><strong>Waruna Karunathilaka</strong> has covered the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka since 1984 for a range of local and foreign news organisations, and is currently working for Time magazine and Reuters. Waruna is a founder member and former convenor of the Free Media Movement, a non-partisan and independent group of journalists and editors in Sri Lanka committed to freedom of expression and which is campaigning for an an end to governmental control of media institutions</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the nineteen-fifties and 'sixties Sri Lanka, then known as Ceylon, had one of the most vibrant print media in the Asian region. The first attempt to curb the media in 1964 resulted in the incumbent government being overthrown when the Press Council Bill was defeated in Parliament. That unfortunately was the last victory for freedom of expression. Since then successive governments have systematically undermined freedom of expression as democracy itself came under threat. Independent publishing houses were either acquired by the government or closed down under emergency regulations. Electronic media has been kept under strict government control. The outbreak of the Tamil separatist war in 1983, gave the government an ideal reason to further tighten controls. The country has been run under emergency regulations for most of the past three decades - with censorship the norm rather than the exception. Intimidation of journalists and media owners, filing of criminal defamation cases against editors and publishers, restrictions on state advertising, and in extreme cases murder have all been used to silence the media. Reporting the separatist war, one of the bloodiest conflicts in the world, was relatively easy in the first decade. However the Sri Lanka government drew its own lessons from the restrictions imposed on the media by the western allies during the Gulf War. Severe restrictions have been imposed on journalists reporting from government areas of the north and east of the country,where the separatist war is been fought. Since 1995 access to rebel held areas has been totally denied with threats of serious actions under emergency regulations for any journalist who dared to break the ban. Strict censorship on local and foreign media during military debacles has left people in dark. Any news organization or journalist which report news adverse to the government is quickly branded as a rebel sympathiser by the powerful state owned print and electronic media which still has the biggest reach. Intense campaigning for media law reforms has been scuttled by the incumbent government fearing a free media would undermine its credibility by exposing widespread corruption, incompetence in governance and rigged elections. The Tamil separatist rebel organisation, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has been no less tolerant of the media. Journalists who criticise the organisation has been routinely murdered and journalists visiting rebel areas are under strict surveillance. Any criticism of the rebels by people living in the north and east is dealt with harshly. However, despite the odds, a section of media, especially the print media has continued to do exactly that. Editors and journalists have paid a high price for their courage. At least a dozen journalists have been murdered, some have fled the country and others face physical violence, or face court cases and well-orchestrated abuse by the state media. News organisations critical of the government often find private sector advertisers have been intimidated and state advertising banned. In the past few months, the government has used another weapon to increase pressure on the media. Taxes on newsprint have been increased by 15% at a time of high newsprint prices in the world market and pressure on advertising due to a serious economic downturn while the private electronic media is been threatened with massive increases in licence fees for transmitting stations. In Sri Lanka freedom of expression is facing perhaps its biggest threat since the island nation achieved independence from Britain in 1948. Waruna Karunathilaka has covered the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka since 1984 for a range of local and foreign news organisations, and is currently working for Time magazine and Reuters. Waruna is a founder member and former convenor of the Free Media Movement, a non-partisan and independent group of journalists and editors in Sri Lanka committed to freedom of expression and which is campaigning for an an end to governmental control of media institutions",

But strict guidelines on local and national coverage, however, remain the rule, rather than the exception.</p> <p>Regional leaders increasingly acknowledge the need for reform and that media institutions that offer only echoes of self-serving applause are of no real value, either to government or to the people. But they are also mindful of the risks. </p> <p>Leaders feel that foreign, especially western, values could undermine their traditions and roots. Second, they would like to maintain their citizens' respectful attitude to their leaders, governed by tribal and religious guidelines. There is a hankering after the media expressing national identity. Information is still seen by the bureaucracy as a privilege to be doled out in small selective doses. </p> <p>So the traditional caveat of 'the national interest' is only one of the factors circumscribing freedom of the press. All too often, an unpleasant incident is suppressed because of the belief that if it is not reported, it simply did not occur. Other societies have learned the hard way that rumour can be a more deadly weapon than the honest reporting of a bomb explosion or a fire.</p> <p>The Gulf has a long way to go to catch up with the Western world and other areas in giving freedom to the media. These countries face many dilemmas, including the need to maintain their heritage and traditions in a fast-changing world. The leaders realise that their societies will change, but they do not wish the changes to be disruptive. </p> <p>In seeking to manage change, the Gulf states have decided that they must also, in varying degrees, manage the media. The publication of Arabic newspapers abroad and starting a free and saucy satellite channel serve as safety vaIves, but the question those in authority must ask themselves is that if Kuwait can live with a relatively free Press, what prevents them from emulating it?</p> <p><strong>S.

The popularity of newspapers such as Al-Hayat in the Arabic-speaking world is testimony to readers' endorsement of their form of reporting. In the United Arab Emirates, a sea-change has taken place in recent years over the leadership's tolerance of dissenting views on world issues outside the immediate area. But strict guidelines on local and national coverage, however, remain the rule, rather than the exception. Regional leaders increasingly acknowledge the need for reform and that media institutions that offer only echoes of self-serving applause are of no real value, either to government or to the people. But they are also mindful of the risks. Leaders feel that foreign, especially western, values could undermine their traditions and roots. Second, they would like to maintain their citizens' respectful attitude to their leaders, governed by tribal and religious guidelines. There is a hankering after the media expressing national identity. Information is still seen by the bureaucracy as a privilege to be doled out in small selective doses. So the traditional caveat of 'the national interest' is only one of the factors circumscribing freedom of the press. All too often, an unpleasant incident is suppressed because of the belief that if it is not reported, it simply did not occur. Other societies have learned the hard way that rumour can be a more deadly weapon than the honest reporting of a bomb explosion or a fire. The Gulf has a long way to go to catch up with the Western world and other areas in giving freedom to the media. These countries face many dilemmas, including the need to maintain their heritage and traditions in a fast-changing world. The leaders realise that their societies will change, but they do not wish the changes to be disruptive. In seeking to manage change, the Gulf states have decided that they must also, in varying degrees, manage the media. The publication of Arabic newspapers abroad and starting a free and saucy satellite channel serve as safety vaIves, but the question those in authority must ask themselves is that if Kuwait can live with a relatively free Press, what prevents them from emulating it?

The initial verdict on the Mayor of London's first year in charge seems to be a rosy one: he barely needs the services of Joy Johnson, the new spin doctor who was appointed last week. Yet the champagne will not be flowing this Friday. With a major London Underground strike and May Day chaos predicted this week, celebrations would seem inappropriate. Livingstone's frustration with the limitations of his job may also help take the shine off this anniversary. Trouble is looming over his plans next month to issue Londoners with a glossy report on his first year's performance, including a mayoral interview conducted by Mirren. The first draft, leaked to The Observer , has already been rewritten after objections to a cheeky portrayal of the Greater London Assembly, which scrutinises Livingstone, as uncertain about how to do its job. The Mayor is also being challenged for taking the credit in 'helping the Metropolitan Police recruit 2,500 more officers', even though only the Home Secretary can authorise changes in police numbers. The GLA sets the Metropolitan Police's budget. And pledges about 'fighting the Government to get the world-class Underground the capital deserves' gloss over the fact that the Treasury is in charge of Tube privatisation.

So far, the Government has resisted subsequent calls for a review. </p> <p>As ever, the children of poor households continue to do worse at school and to get the worst-paid jobs, or none. By their late teens, that damage may be irreversible.

Perhaps such caveats count for little against a suspicion that approval from those debarred by extreme poverty from saving, including the seven out of 10 lone parents who currently have no back-up funds at all, is not the applause Labour most desires. </p> <p>Despite last week's volte-face allowing more generous parental leave, women of all backgrounds remain sceptical of a government perceived to have done too little on childcare provision and flexible working hours.

A similar number of 11-year-olds said they had tried cocaine. Around twice as many said they had used cannabis, glue or had sniffed propellents and inhalants known as 'gas'. </p> <p>The findings, based on questionnaires filled in by 20,000 children in 67 secondary schools last year, contradict recent government claims that juvenile drug use is falling. </p> <p>Last week experts called for a complete overhaul of Britain's drugs education programmes. </p> <p>The biggest such exercise ever undertaken, the survey is the first to look in detail at the habitual use of drugs by schoolchildren. It aimed to show whether they used drugs regularly rather than on an experimental basis. A user was defined as someone taking drugs on a weekly basis for at least three months. </p> <p>'The results were very striking,' said Jeremy Gluck, of Adolescent Assessment Services, the Swansea-based consultancy that carried out the survey on behalf of local education authorities. 'Drug use is much more extensive than we thought. The sheer numbers involved are very worrying. Some totals were so high that we genuinely didn't want to believe them.' </p> <p>The survey found that one in nine 16-year-old boys who admitted using drugs said they did so every day. More than a third used drugs - mainly cannabis, but also harder drugs - at least once a week. </p> <p>The figures for girls were only slightly lower and nearly 8 per cent of all 16-year-olds said they had been using drugs, including ecstasy and LSD, on a weekly basis for at least three months. </p> <p>The survey also found that patterns of drug use shifted according to age. A fifth of 16-year-old boys said they preferred cannabis, whereas only one in 50 said they habitually used glue or gas. </p> <p>It also looked at drinking and smoking. It found that 5 per cent of 11-year-olds and 40 per cent of 16-year-olds drank alcohol on a weekly basis. A fifth of 16-year-old boys said they were 'drunk' - defined as 'feeling sick and falling about' - at least once a fortnight. </p> <p>The figures confirm a suspected increase in alcohol consumption among youngsters, especially in 'binge' drinking. </p> <p>According to the research, around one in 20 11-year-olds smoke daily. Nearly a third of 15-year-old girls do so, an increase of more than 40 per cent compared with 1998 official figures. Young smokers' habits are also surprisingly heavy. Around half of all 11- to 16-year-old smokers consume between six and 15 cigarettes daily. </p> <p>According to Gluck, one of the most significant findings is the importance of smoking and drinking to initiating later drug use. Children most commonly start to use drugs, cigarettes and alcohol between 13 and 14. </p> <p>There are concerns over the ability of schools to cope with the problem. A recent Ofsted survey found that under 50 per cent of primary schools had a policy on drug-related incidents. Many believe the traditional approach involving lectures by police officers, former addicts and specialists is not effective. </p> <p>'There is too little, too late,' said Michelle Roe, a director of Life Education Centres. 'There is no point in lecturing 12 year olds, whose attitudes are formed. You have to speak to five year olds.'</p>",

The figures for girls were only slightly lower and nearly 8 per cent of all 16-year-olds said they had been using drugs, including ecstasy and LSD, on a weekly basis for at least three months. The survey also found that patterns of drug use shifted according to age. A fifth of 16-year-old boys said they preferred cannabis, whereas only one in 50 said they habitually used glue or gas. It also looked at drinking and smoking. It found that 5 per cent of 11-year-olds and 40 per cent of 16-year-olds drank alcohol on a weekly basis. A fifth of 16-year-old boys said they were 'drunk' - defined as 'feeling sick and falling about' - at least once a fortnight. The figures confirm a suspected increase in alcohol consumption among youngsters, especially in 'binge' drinking. According to the research, around one in 20 11-year-olds smoke daily. Nearly a third of 15-year-old girls do so, an increase of more than 40 per cent compared with 1998 official figures. Young smokers' habits are also surprisingly heavy. Around half of all 11- to 16-year-old smokers consume between six and 15 cigarettes daily. According to Gluck, one of the most significant findings is the importance of smoking and drinking to initiating later drug use. Children most commonly start to use drugs, cigarettes and alcohol between 13 and 14. There are concerns over the ability of schools to cope with the problem. A recent Ofsted survey found that under 50 per cent of primary schools had a policy on drug-related incidents. Many believe the traditional approach involving lectures by police officers, former addicts and specialists is not effective. 'There is too little, too late,' said Michelle Roe, a director of Life Education Centres. 'There is no point in lecturing 12 year olds, whose attitudes are formed. You have to speak to five year olds.'",

A decade ago, soon after the European Capital of Culture year in 1990, Glasgow was presented to visitors as the Friendly City. But on housing schemes less than a mile from the city centre, Mrs Abdallah and thousands of others seeking political asylum are finding hatred. </p> <p>Scotland's largest city extended the hand of friendship to those claiming to be fleeing persecution just over a year ago, when attempts were made to disperse them throughout the UK to await a decision on whether they could stay. </p> <p>Mrs Abdallah, who did not want to give her real name, arrived at Heathrow with her husband on 22 May. He had been a supporter of Abdullah Ocalan's Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), which has for years sought a Kurdish state spanning land mainly in northern Iraq and southern Turkey. Following Ocalan's arrest two years ago by the Turkish authorities, the factional Kurdish movement was subject to further splits and bitter infighting. Political violence had already claimed the lives of close relatives and now Mr Abdallah found his own life threatened. </p> <p>'He was told he would be killed if he stayed,' said Mrs Abdallah. 'But all we wanted was a normal life. So we went to Istanbul and from there got on a plane to London. If people did not have problems they would not come to the UK, leaving their homes, their friends and their families.' </p> <p>Fluent in English and four other languages, the 33-year-old said there was little in the way of advice on arrival at Heathrow. The couple had just \u00a3200 to last a month. 'We had no idea London was so expensive. I had to sell a gold ring that I used to wear. A woman bought it from me for \u00a312. We needed money. When we got to Glasgow I had to ask the people at the Scottish Refugee Council for a food parcel.' </p> <p>Surviving on vouchers of \u00a337 and \u00a320 cash a week, the couple are housed in a small flat in the Sighthill area of the city, which has a massive heroin problem. </p> <p>Asylum-seekers have come to Glasgow from Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Turkey and other countries. Some have been sent to the outskirts and few problems with local residents have been reported. But a heavy concentration of the 4,000 who are in the city are in Sighthill and it is here that serious problems are emerging. </p> <p>Last week, in one of many recent incidents, two badly bruised Palestinian brothers said they were beaten by a gang of teenagers. 'It is horrible what has been happening,' lamented Mrs Abdallah. 'For me it is not so bad as I know the language, but still people swear and throw stones. I cannot tell you the things they say. It is unrepeatable. The attitude towards us has got much worse in recent months.' </p> <p>Mrs Abdallah said that a pregnant Lebanese woman and her husband were recently pursued by a gang of 16- and 17-year-olds. 'The husband pleaded with them not to touch his wife but she was scratched and beaten. She was physically attacked. </p> <p>'On another occasion some boys got golf clubs and went into a flat where Kurdish boys were living and hit them. Irn-Bru bottles have been thrown at our window, as have stones. And there is a small hole in our window that cannot have been made by a stone. It looks like a bullet hole.' </p> <p>Chief Superintendent Allan Burnett, race relations officer with Strathclyde Police, is adamant that the force is tackling the problem. 'The issue of children is a big one. Over 50 per cent of people detected causing problems are children.' </p> <p>Burnett said a number of factors are working to lift the figures: 'There is a seasonal factor. With the longer nights in the summer months there is usually a pattern of increased trouble among youths. As each month has passed the number of incidents has increased, but there has been an increased willingness to report incidents.' </p> <p>He said: 'We need to build links and trust with the asylum-seekers.' Burnett pointed out that, while there are around 4,000 in the city now, the number will increase towards a ceiling of 6,000. He believes that many will choose to stay should they be granted asylum and a community of greater numbers will develop. </p> <p>'The force has embarked on a series of community relations meetings, the first of which was well-attended last weekend.' </p> <p>To deal with the minority, and to build links and trust with those who have recently arrived, Burnett is making sure that officers on the beat provide a visible presence in the problem areas. 'Foot patrols have been put in place. Officers must be visible in appropriate, not necessarily big, numbers.' </p> <p>Paul Martin, MSP for the Springburn constituency that includes Sighthill, supports the move for an increased police presence. 'People need to be aware that the officers are there. We need to be directing additional funding for policing.' Martin also said more could be done at a local level to help new arrivals learn English, one problem Mrs Abdallah does not have. She helps translate for others who do not possess her strong command of the language. 'It is important people coming here learn English,' she said. 'Life is so much easier when you know the language.' As of last month there was a 500-strong waiting list for English lessons. </p> <p>Despite the anger that faces her on a daily basis, Mrs Abdallah remains very fond of Scotland and hopes to remain in Glasgow: 'We have neighbours who deal in drugs, yet many people have been very nice to us. We have made an effort to fit in and most people do seem to appreciate that. In these areas many people are suffering. It is not just us. The biggest problems are down to waiting. We must wait for a decision. We must wait to hear about work.' </p> <p>While she waits, Mrs Abdallah has one simple desire as she walks from her Sighthill flat to catch the bus that will take her to college: 'I just wish to be treated gently.'</p>",

I come from a railway town, my uncle and grandfather were employed at the now-defunct carriage works in my old home town of York. I was brought up in a house beside the York to Scarborough line and spent many a happy hour of my childhood waving to the train drivers. </p> <p>I also have vivid childhood memories of visiting the small museum that closed to make way for the National Railway Museum in York. In those days, you could climb into the locomotive cabs and touch all those polished brass dials and levers. (And a note to all those men who always tell me that my obsession with trains is a phallic thing: do they honestly think their rather unattractive genitals bear any relation to a 102-ton steel locomotive?

I come from a railway town, my uncle and grandfather were employed at the now-defunct carriage works in my old home town of York. I was brought up in a house beside the York to Scarborough line and spent many a happy hour of my childhood waving to the train drivers. I also have vivid childhood memories of visiting the small museum that closed to make way for the National Railway Museum in York. In those days, you could climb into the locomotive cabs and touch all those polished brass dials and levers. (And a note to all those men who always tell me that my obsession with trains is a phallic thing: do they honestly think their rather unattractive genitals bear any relation to a 102-ton steel locomotive? I think not.) My greatest wish has always been to ride on the footplate of a Class A-4 Pacific locomotive, the most magnificent thing ever to come out of an engineering shed.

Following the signing of the Lome Peace accord in July 1999, I felt vindicated and relieved - it had been because of my paper's stance for constructive dialogue to end the crisis that my life had been threatened and I had been chased into exile. </p> <p>While I gave some interviews to the BBC and VOA on the ongoing peace process, I felt that this was not enough. Then suddenly I felt the urge to re-launch my newspaper and continue the campaign for peace, democracy and human rights for all. </p> <p>But I wondered how I could do this while still in exile and after having lost everything including my office and newspaper gadgets, my staff, two of whom were still detained by the authorities awaiting trial for treason.</p> <p>My chance came when I met Brian Whitaker of the Guardian and John Owen of the Freedom Forum at a September 1999 conference in London. When I told Brian of my plans to being publishing the newspaper again, possibly by printing copies abroad and then distributing them, Brian sold the idea of publishing online. He also linked me up with Ian Wright, the Guardian Foundation Chairman, who also helped a lot with advice and logistics to start the project. </p> <p>As I had no experience of using the internet, Brian helped me to build the website, with a template for updating each edition, and offered me initial training on how to do the updates. John Owen paid for the registration of the web site and I launched it on March 15, 2000. </p> <p>The site got 3000 hits that first day and it has been growing since then. Since then I have been publishing fortnightly with regular online news updates between issues. Brian helped with the updates for three months after which I took over the complete running of the website from him. While doing both the newspaper editing and uploading of the articles on the website has been very demanding, my paper is now enjoying a daily average of 6000 hits.</p> <p>I've contributors based in Sierra Leone, Ghana, the USA, Canada, Holland, Belgium, Germany, France and I'm happy that they've been co-operating in sending articles about Sierra Leone and Africa. Apart from linking the Sierra Leonean community abroad and those at home, the paper has emerged as one of the most, if not the most vocal and dependemble source of information on Sierra Leone and Africa. With my newly appointed West Africa bureau editor based in Ghana, my paper is now featuring interpretative reports from that region almost on a daily basis.</p> <p>With the help of this online project I've also been able to relaunch the printed version of my newspaper in Sierra Leone with the help of my small staff. Most of the articles that go into the printed paper are downloaded directly from my on line paper. Apart from some logistical problems the printed paper is facing, coupled with some verbal threats on my bureau editor's life, the printed paper has also been doing fine.</p> <p>Although I've been hosting some adverts of Sierra Leonean owned businesses, I've not realised much from them and the little that comes in has not been enough to cover the cost of running the website. The desk-top PC I received from the Guardian Foundation through Ian Wright and the laptop John Owen offered me have been indispensable.</p> <p>Since December 2000, my newspaper has been part of the allafrica.com network operating from Washington in March and since then my paper's articles from Sierra Leone, West Africa and other parts of the world are often among its top headlines. I am also relieved that the little that will come in from that contract in lieu of royalties will help stabilise the paper a little to encourage its contributors who have been doing an excellent job. I am also seeking grant funding which I think I need to expand the web site in terms of target audience and the volume of articles.</p> <p>The online paper's first birthday event funded and hosted in London by the Freedom Forum European Center on March 15 went a long way to boost its profile. As part of the celebrations, three of my contributors were brought in from Sierra Leone, Canada and Germany by the Freedom Forum to join me in sharing our online experience with other journalists and well-wishers. I was also a guest on 'Global' on BBC Radio 5 and on BBC Network Africa programmes. Among other things, I said that the internet is indeed a salvation for journalists in exile and that African dictators should be warned that no matter what they do to suppress the independent press the internet is always there as the last resort.</p> <p><strong>Ibrahim Sega Shaw</strong> is editor and publisher of the Expo Times, which he continues to publish from exile in France. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.expotimes.net\">The Expo Times</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.allafrica.com\">allafrica.com</a></p>",

While doing both the newspaper editing and uploading of the articles on the website has been very demanding, my paper is now enjoying a daily average of 6000 hits. I've contributors based in Sierra Leone, Ghana, the USA, Canada, Holland, Belgium, Germany, France and I'm happy that they've been co-operating in sending articles about Sierra Leone and Africa. Apart from linking the Sierra Leonean community abroad and those at home, the paper has emerged as one of the most, if not the most vocal and dependemble source of information on Sierra Leone and Africa. With my newly appointed West Africa bureau editor based in Ghana, my paper is now featuring interpretative reports from that region almost on a daily basis. With the help of this online project I've also been able to relaunch the printed version of my newspaper in Sierra Leone with the help of my small staff. Most of the articles that go into the printed paper are downloaded directly from my on line paper. Apart from some logistical problems the printed paper is facing, coupled with some verbal threats on my bureau editor's life, the printed paper has also been doing fine. Although I've been hosting some adverts of Sierra Leonean owned businesses, I've not realised much from them and the little that comes in has not been enough to cover the cost of running the website. The desk-top PC I received from the Guardian Foundation through Ian Wright and the laptop John Owen offered me have been indispensable. Since December 2000, my newspaper has been part of the allafrica.com network operating from Washington in March and since then my paper's articles from Sierra Leone, West Africa and other parts of the world are often among its top headlines. I am also relieved that the little that will come in from that contract in lieu of royalties will help stabilise the paper a little to encourage its contributors who have been doing an excellent job. I am also seeking grant funding which I think I need to expand the web site in terms of target audience and the volume of articles. The online paper's first birthday event funded and hosted in London by the Freedom Forum European Center on March 15 went a long way to boost its profile. As part of the celebrations, three of my contributors were brought in from Sierra Leone, Canada and Germany by the Freedom Forum to join me in sharing our online experience with other journalists and well-wishers. I was also a guest on 'Global' on BBC Radio 5 and on BBC Network Africa programmes. Among other things, I said that the internet is indeed a salvation for journalists in exile and that African dictators should be warned that no matter what they do to suppress the independent press the internet is always there as the last resort.

      "body": "<p>It appeared to be an inspired decision to open the 54th Cannes International Film Festival with Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge (pictured). The 9 May curtain-raiser to the world's biggest fusion of art and commerce is a brash American movie that is also a Valentine to French showbusiness. </p> <p>But the evening has already thrown up a major headache. 20th Century-Fox wanted to throw an opening night bash befitting its raucous $50 million musical set in Pigalle's red-light district in the 1890s. The festival organisers, however, favoured the traditional black tie gala, complete with polite speeches, ideally to be held in an elegant marquee. The compromise: the studio is recreating Pigalle inside two interconnected circus tents. Against a backdrop of the romantic elements of Paris and the French culture, 2,000 invited guests, including the film's stars Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, can watch can-can dancers cavort while listening to music overseen by guest DJ, Fatboy Slim.</p> <p>Party protocol is only one of the differences between the Cannes organisers and Hollywood, whose symbiotic and increasingly strained relationship has dominated the event in recent years. Cannes has always been a global launch pad for American movies, from All About Eve to Pulp Fiction, but soaring production costs mean the US studios are now more jittery about bringing their films to a festival where they are at the mercy of critics and discriminating audiences. On the other hand, in recent years the Cannes organisers have often been so keen to bask in the media spotlight that they have rolled out the red carpet for Hollywood's most commercial follies. </p> <p>American stars may be thin on the ground this May because of the Screen Actors Guild's looming strike: many productions are currently shooting around the clock to beat the 30 June deadline. One Cannes drop-out is Jodie Foster, who was to have presided over the festival's jury until she was tapped as a last-minute replacement for Nicole Kidman, who had limped off David Fincher's The Panic Room with a knee injury. Panic-stricken Columbia Pictures could not afford to delay shooting to accommodate Foster's Cannes duties. </p> <p>The fraught relationship between the sensitive artists of the old world and the marauding monsters of the new reached its nadir in 1998 when Godzilla was selected as the event's closing film. You hardly need to be a Jean-Luc Godard buff to grasp the symbolism. </p> <p>Which is why Thierry Fremaux, in his first year as artistic director, is so keen to reclaim the artistic high ground Cannes has ceded inch-by-inch to rival festivals in Venice and Berlin. There is certainly a feeling of deja vu surveying this year's competition line-up, which includes a new film from 70-year-old Godard. Indeed Eloge de L'Amour is rumoured to be one of the former New Waver's strongest and most accessible works. </p> <p>Joining Godard is a filmmaker of even more advanced years, 73-year-old former critic, Jacques Rivette, whose new film Va Savoir! is only his twelfth in 40 years. And he is not the oldest competitor. That honour goes to Portugal's Cannes fixture, 92-year-old Manoel de Oliveira, whose Je Rentre la Maison stars the first lady of French cinema, Catherine Deneuve, and John Malkovich. </p> <p>most of the directors in competition this year are repeat visitors, such as the Coen brothers and David Lynch, whose latest works, O Brother, Where Art Thou? and The Straight Story, premiered at Cannes. Lynch's visceral Wild at Heart won the top prize at Cannes in 1990 and the Coens swept the board the following year with Barton Fink. Their new crime flick, The Man Who Wasn't There, starring Frances McDormand, Billy Bob Thornton and The Sopranos's James Gandolfini, is rumoured to be more offbeat than O Brother, which, despite lukewarm reviews, became their most profitable picture to date. Lynch's latest, the noirish Mulholland Drive, starring Patricia Arquette and Tim Robbins, was originally made as the pilot for a television series. </p> <p>The fourth American film out of the 23 in competition is Sean Penn's police drama, The Pledge, starring Jack Nicholson and Benicio del Toro. Other American films, directed by Todd Solondz, Hal Hartley and actors Jennifer Jason Leigh and Alan Cumming, are included in sections outside the main competition.</p> <p>Veteran Japanese director Shohei Imamura, who controversially won the Palme d'Or in 1983 with The Ballad of Narayama and again in 1997 with Unagi is also back this year with the intriguingly titled Lukewarm Water Under a Red Bridge. So is Italy's Ermano Olmi, whose period epic, The Tree of the Wooden Clogs, walked away with the 1978 Palme d'Or. Olmi's latest is The Profession of Arms. </p> <p>Also returning from Italy is Nanni Moretti with The Son's Room, and the Austrian auteur Michael Haneke is back with The Piano Teacher, starring Isabelle Huppert. Raoul Ruiz returns to close the festival with Les Ames Fortes, which screens out of competition. </p> <p>Fremaux's most daring decision is to have selected DreamWorks's Shrek, the first animated film to be in competition since 1953, when Peter Pan charmed festival-goers. Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz provide the voices in the state-of-the-art film that pokes fun at Disney animations. </p> <p>Cannes seems to be infatuated with Italian-Americans. Films screening outside the competition slots include Francis Coppola's extended version of Apocalypse Now (a film that originally premiered at Cannes), the debut film from his son, Roman, entitled C.Q., and Martin Scorsese's four-hour documentary, My Voyage in Italy. The Spike Jonze-produced Human Nature from pop video director Michel Gondry could even be included in this category: Jonze is married to Coppola's daughter Sofia. </p> <p>Eastern Asian and Chinese-language films are not as dominant at Cannes as they were last year, but the Far East, particularly Japan, still has an impressive presence with three movies in competition. In addition to Imamura, Japan is represented by Hirokazu Kore-Eda, who found fame on the festival circuit with After Life. Kore-Eda's latest film, Distance, is about the relatives of a group of dead terrorists. Also included is Desert Moon, by last year's Cannes discovery, Shinji Aoyama, whose three-hour feature, Eureka, recently opened in the US. Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien is back with The Story of Rose, which stars Shu Qi.</p> <p>twelve countries are represented in the official selection including first- timers Bosnia with No Man's Land, directed by Danis Tanovic. Ireland is represented by a three-minute short called Chicken. The most notable absentees are the Australians, which is ironic considering that Baz Luhrmann was a Cannes discovery with Strictly Ballroom in 1990, and the British. </p> <p>Nobody who has sat through the largely woeful collection of British films from the last year could be surprised by the UK's omission from Cannes competition, but at least the French have decided to hold a special sympathy screening of Ken Loach's Kes. While many filmmakers have recently embraced the social realism Loach captured 30 years ago - indeed, the overriding topics of this year's Cannes films are mourning and melancholy, loneliness and violence - the British industry is hurtling in the opposite direction, churning out pale facsimiles of its rare break-out hits. These days, most British films are managing to miss out on both festival plaudits and multiples queues.</p> <p>Producer Nik Powell, who has had several films screened at Cannes over the years, including Mona Lisa, Neon Bible and Scandal, is more generous in his assessment: 'There are two reasons why there are no British films this year. First, most of our Cannes directors have not made films that are ready. And second, many more filmmaking territories have recently opened up and Cannes has not extended the size of the event to reflect this. For example, a few years ago, there were hardly any Asian films at Cannes.'</p> <p>More significantly, though, in the last year there have been seismic shifts in the marketplace to the extent that what may initially look like a predictable and esoteric line-up of blink-and-you'll-miss-them festival films is in fact the real vanguard of commercialism. Several titles in last year's Cannes line-up seemed alien to the public but ended up as money-spinners while dozens of more recognisable studio films crashed and burned. Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon hauled in more than $100m in pure profit - even more than Pulp Fiction - while Dancer in the Dark, In the Mood For Love, Yi Yi and O Brother all catapulted their directors into the bankability league. And let's not forget that Billy Elliot took his first steps at Cannes last year. Already there is industry buzz surrounding the film Tears of the Black Tiger, which may bring the Thai western genre to a cinema near you soon.</p> <p>Look at what three of the directors who had films shown at Cannes last year are up to.

A Bordeaux chteau owner, selling his pile to avoid French tax, asked me: 'Where should I buy my next vineyard?' I suggested the Alentejo or the Languedoc, both places with cheap land, a reliable climate and the potential to make great wines. He looked at me as if I'd suggested a move to Romania. 'No one would pay a high price for the wine because no one could point to either place on a map.' </p> <p>The wine world is like a game of Monopoly in this respect: if Bordeaux is Mayfair, then Romania is the Old Kent Road.

You've got plenty of choice if you avoid the obvious blue-chip regions: Bordeaux, Burgundy, the Napa Valley, Piedmont, Tuscany, Ribera del Duero and Champagne. </p> <p>My tips, in no particular order, are: Chile, Argentina, southern Italy and the islands, Greece, Portugal, Navarra, Jerez and Tarragona in Spain, the Loire Valley, the southern Rhne and the Languedoc-Roussillon in France, South Africa and parts of Australia. Buy wisely from these places and you'll drink good wine at decent prices. You won't be the envy of label worshippers, but do you care? I don't, but then what do I know?

      "body": "<p>For one second, I thought I saw the shadow of a smile. A crack at the corner of her lips. At last an acknowledgment of my continued custom - 20 years now. But no. That is not the way they do business in London's Chinatown, with its baskets of strange greens and dangling ducks. I guess a surly grunt is preferable to an insincere 'Have a nice day.' </p> <p>The greens arrive by truck, hugger-mugger in loose-weave reed baskets that could double as a laundry bin. Heads down, the shop staff machete the untidy green stems into shape, bring the leaves together into a uniform huddle then secure them with a rubber band. Neat, crisp, pert. The gardener Joy Larkcom describes them as 'the warp and woof of Chinese cookery'. </p> <p>A little oval plate of steamed Chinese greens in oyster sauce interests me more than any other vegetable. Even asparagus. It could be the tender-stemmed and elegant choi sum, the purple-veined spinach or the fat, leafy bulbs of pak choi. Then again, the chef might have splashed his sizzling garlic, oyster sauce and shredded ginger over long, finger-thick stems of Chinese broccoli. A Chinese meal is never quite the same without that little battered dish, its well-worn edges and its steaming mound of 'greens in brown stuff'. </p> <p>Pak choi, sometimes called baak choi, seems to me to be perhaps the perfect vegetable, having soft, melting leaves and plump stems bursting with juice. So there you are, stuffing the steaming leaves into your mouth, getting the hot sting of garlic and ginger and the deep savour of the oyster sauce, then - crunch - you bite into the chubby stems and the blistering juice squirts out. A sensational mouthful that makes our national dish of buttered broccoli look about as exciting as compost. </p> <p>There are usually two sorts of pak choi on sale. A white-stemmed one with dark leaves and a pale green-stemmed one with softer leaves. Both are good. I am attempting to grow the latter in the garden this year. </p> <p>Even better than pak choi is the same idea made with Chinese broccoli. The stems are like asparagus, tender but with some resistance. Now, we have been led to assume these platters of glistening greens are straight from the steamer. Yet anyone who has tried this will know that by the time the stems are al dente the leaves have turned the colour of a squashed frog. What you need to do is plunge the stems and their leaves into deep, furiously boiling water. I don't salt mine much, as most Asian bottled sauces are so jam-packed with the stuff that you are bound to overdo it. The quicker they cook the better. </p> <p>Gaai choi is the loosely packed brassica with wavy leaves. As if someone has done an impression of Melvyn Bragg's hair with a cabbage. It keeps well and has a smart, mustardy bite. In fact, most shoppers know it as mustard cabbage. It needs a good wash. Aphids and grit like to snuggle down inside the folds of the stems. </p> <p>This is where things get complicated. Even as a regular user of Asian shops, I get my Chinese broccoli mixed up with my Chinese flowering cabbage. Both have long green stems and leaves. Both have tight flowers bursting yellow. The flavour is not dissimilar. Eagle eyes will pick up that the cabbage has more pointed, shinier leaves and whiter stems. The broccoli, the vegetable I long more than any other to find in British greengrocers and markets, has more tenderness and softer leaves. Both are candidates for blanching or stir-frying. </p> <p>Greens of any sort are comfortable with the knee-jerk seasonings of garlic, ginger and chilli, but I like them with lemon, too. If you are stir-frying, add some very finely shredded lemon grass to the garlic and ginger before you add the leaves. A good squirt from a lemon would do, too. </p> <p>I honestly do not know why we don't grow these greens instead of our boring broccoli and pungent sprouts. The few specialists and keen amateurs who do, claim our weather is perfect for them. Many taste of mustard, too, a spice that seems part of the British soul. I must say I don't use them with fish - I don't think they work together - but their green heat is welcome with chicken, pork and beef, and they are fine on their own tossed with the garlic and ginger with which they sit so happily.</p> <p><strong> Chicken with choi sum and lemon grass</strong><br> </p> <p> Enough for 1 as a main dish </p> <p><strong>250g boned free-range chicken meat </strong><br><strong> 1 large, fat stalk of lemon grass (or 3 smaller supermarket ones) </strong><br><strong> 2 fat, juicy garlic cloves </strong><br><strong> 1 large knob of ginger, about the size of a golf ball </strong><br><strong> groundnut oil </strong></p> <p>for the greens</p> <p><strong>300g choi sum or Chinese broccoli 1 plump clove of garlic </strong><br> <strong> groundnut oil </strong><br> <strong> a small handful chopped coriander leaves </strong></p> <p>Cut the chicken into thin strips, about the thickness of a little finger. Put them into a bowl. Peel the outer leaves from the lemon grass and slice the more tender inner leaves into very fine rounds. Peel the ginger and finely crush it. Peel the ginger, too, then rub it on a very fine grater, so that you get a thick pur\u00e9e. Scrape it into the bowl with the chicken, the garlic and the sliced lemon grass. Drizzle over enough oil to moisten and toss the whole lot gently, then set aside for an hour or more. </p> <p>Rinse the greens under running water, then tear into manageable lengths. Peel and finely chop the garlic. Get a wok hot, pour in a small pool of oil, let it smoke, then add the marinated chicken. There will be much splutter and pop. Let the chicken cook, without moving it, until the underside is golden brown. Now turn it over and cook the other side. </p> <p>Lift the chicken out with a draining spoon or tongs. Toss the garlic into the wok, then before it burns, dump the greens, shaken free of any water, in with it. They will crackle and steam alarmingly. (If they don't, your wok wasn't hot enough). Turn them over in the hot oil for a minute or two until they wilt and the stems are tender. </p> <p>Return the chicken and any escaped juices to the wok. Grind over some salt, chuck in the coriander and toss gently together. Serve while hot and sizzling.</p> <p><strong> Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce and ginger</strong><br> </p> <p> In theory, this is a side dish. That is how it would be eaten in a Chinese restaurant. I am happy to eat it as a supper dish, piled on top of a bowl of rice. Enough for 2 as a side dish. </p> <p><strong> 600g pak choi, choi sum or Chinese broccoli </strong></p> <p> for the sauce</p> <p><strong> 1 knob of ginger about the size of a golf ball </strong><br> <strong> 2 large, juicy cloves of garlic </strong><br> <strong> 2 tbsp groundnut or vegetable oil </strong><br> <strong> 2 tbsp oyster sauce </strong><br> <strong> 1 tsp sesame oil </strong></p> <p>Rinse the greens, taking care to get every bit of grit out from the folds of the leaves. A brief soak in cold water is probably the best way. Peel the ginger and cut it into wafer-thin slices, then cut into matchstick-sized shreds. Peel the garlic and chop finely. </p> <p>Fill a large pan with water, bring to a furious boil and salt lightly. Dunk the green on to the water and leave to boil till tender. I think they should have a bit of bite, too. </p> <p>When the greens are within a minute or two of doneness, get a wok or frying pan really hot, then add the oil. As the oil starts to shimmer and lightly smoke, throw in the ginger and garlic. Quickly move the pan around so that the oil and aromatics swoosh around and up the sides. The garlic will colour in seconds - don't let it burn. Stir in the oyster sauce and the sesame oil and let it bubble briefly. Turn off the heat. Drain the greens, then add them to the sauce. Any drips of water left will simply help to correct the consistency of the sauce. Eat while the greens are still piping hot. </p> <p><strong> Stir-fried choi sum</strong><br> </p> <p>Choi sum leaves are like spinach in that they cook down to nothing. What may seem like a misprint soon appears to shrivel down to the right amount. Enough for 1-2 as a side dish. </p> <p> <strong>500g spinach, Chinese purple spinach or choi sum </strong><br> <strong> 2 tbsp groundnut oil </strong><br> <strong> 2 fat cloves of garlic </strong><br> <strong> 1 knob of ginger, the size of a walnut in its shell </strong><br> <strong> 1 medium-sized, hot, fresh red chilli </strong><br> <strong> 2 tbsp Chinese rice wine </strong><br> <strong> 1 tsp caster sugar </strong><br> <strong> tsp salt </strong></p> <p>Remove the thickest of the stems from the choi sum - but leave the tender ones - or discard any coarse leaves from the spinach. Rinse thoroughly to remove any grit. </p> <p>Peel the garlic and finely chop. Peel the ginger and shred finely, so that each piece is not thicker than a matchstick. Cut the chilli in half lengthways, remove the seeds if you wish (leave them in if you fancy something rather hotter), then slice very thinly. </p> <p>Get your wok hot over a high flame, then add the oil. It will shimmer and maybe smoke slightly. Quickly scrape in the garlic and the ginger. Move them quickly round the pan, either by shaking the pan or with chopsticks. They will brown in seconds. Throw in the chilli. Now add the greens and stir-fry for one minute. In that time they should wilt and soften to a deep emerald green. Move them around quickly so that they do not burn. Slosh in the rice wine (or a drop of dry sherry, if that is what you have around), then sprinkle over the sugar and the salt. Don't be tempted to add less: they are an essential part of the recipe. Leave to bubble for a minute or two, then serve immediately.</p>",

Today, reinvented as a veritable wining-and-dining complex called Corinthian, the old Sheriff's Court is now a place where the crimes are actually committed. Granted, bad cooking probably does not warrant a long stretch inside. But the offence of grievous bodily harm upon a lovely little sea bream really ought to carry with it some form of judicial penalty. </p> <p>It was not what I had hoped for from Glasgow. The city has developed a fearsome reputation for its restaurants, which can only be secured now that an outpost of the Gordon Ramsay empire has pitched tent at One Devonshire Gardens. In theory, I was not spoiled for interesting places to try. In practice, it was a Sunday night and most of them were closed. In any case, for those interested in the bizarre excesses to which Britain's burgeoning restaurant business is prone, there was something irresistible about Corinthian. It is, for a start, the first restaurant I have seen advertised at an airport. There is a huge illuminated billboard - announcing its many bars and private rooms and members-only facilities - that is right in your face as you come off the shuttle from London. </p> <p>But then there is nothing shy and retiring about Corinthian. The pillars are huge. The arches are wide. The ceilings are high and grand and carry every flounce and flourish you could wish for, plus enough gold to keep Tutankhamen happy. Indeed, the only thing wearing more gold than the ceiling was the clientele. Corinthian is flash. </p> <p>The menu tries to be equally so, and that's where it falls down. This really is a remarkable setting. It's vivid and theatrical and, if you're looking for a special night out, vivid and theatrical is sometimes exactly what you want. Stefan King, the chap behind the conversion, should be congratulated for having the balls to do it. Now, though, he should turn his attention to the kitchen. </p> <p>The problem is one of complete over-adornment. Just reading the list makes you dizzy. Take a starter of confit Cajun salmon. Confit salmon could be nice. Cajun salmon equally so. But both? Likewise a main-course dish advertised with both Thai spicing and Indian lime pickle displays a scatter-gun approach to the global larder. </p> <p>I began with the most successful dish of the whole meal - what was described as a 'cassoulet' terrine of black pudding and ham hock. It was rich and unctuous and the white beans slipped in between the two other ingredients offered a calming influence. It was completely let down, however, by a pool of a grimly over-reduced meaty sauce, which stuck to the roof of my mouth. We would become very familiar with it before the night was out. My companion Steven, the Observer 's new Scotland editor, chose red mullet fillets on a tian of leeks with a red pepper sauce. It was fearsomely cold, and therefore completely tasteless, as if it had only just waved goodbye to the fridge. </p> <p>After a long wait, during which we had a lot of time to admire the ceiling, our main courses were delivered and, before we could say anything, our waitress departed. We stared at the table. Something was definitely missing. It reminded me of the joke about the old Jewish guy who calls over the waiter and demands he try the soup. 'What's wrong with it,' says the waiter. 'Just try the soup,' says the man. 'But what's wrong with it?' The old man barks at him: 'Try the soup.' 'OK,' says the waiter. 'Where's the spoon?' The old man claps his hands with grim pleasure. 'Exactly,' he says. </p> <p>There was no cutlery on our table. I looked for waiting staff, but the room is so big they were probably obscured by the curvature of the earth. Eventually we got up and nicked knives and forks off a table half a kilometre away. It was a bit of a pity we did, because it meant we could eat. Steven had ordered the roast duck breast. The meat was fine, served pink as he had requested, but it came on a lake of that appalling sauce which, in turn, was studded with unnecessary lumps of beetroot. This was a dish that simply did not work. </p> <p>It was a veritable triumph next to mine: that roasted sea bream on curried noodles with a sauce vierge. I will admit I ordered it because it sounded terrible, but if it's on a menu it ought to be edible. The bream was over-seasoned and the tough and chewy noodles had been flavoured with something that tasted like it had come out of one of those packets you get in a pot noodle. That's not hyperbole. That really is what it reminded me of. Beneath the approximation of a vierge lay another river of that meat reduction, as if no dish was allowed out of the kitchen until the sauce guy had been allowed to screw it up. (Incidentally, if these were three different sauces, the effort was wasted, because they tasted the same to me.) </p> <p>The mixed puddings that I tried were more successful, as in not offensive, being mostly ice creams and sorbets. Steven was less impressed with his macadamia-nut ice cream. 'It's like skiing at Aviemore,' he said. 'It promises snow but delivers ice.' </p> <p>All of this wouldn't really matter so much if Corinthian was cheap. But, of course, it isn't. The fact is it costs an awful lot of money to over-gild the lily. They have to get it back somehow.</p> <p>Contact Jay Rayner on <a href=\"mailto:jay.rayner@observer.co.uk\">jay.rayner@observer.co.uk</a>.</p>",

Beneath the approximation of a vierge lay another river of that meat reduction, as if no dish was allowed out of the kitchen until the sauce guy had been allowed to screw it up. (Incidentally, if these were three different sauces, the effort was wasted, because they tasted the same to me.) The mixed puddings that I tried were more successful, as in not offensive, being mostly ice creams and sorbets. Steven was less impressed with his macadamia-nut ice cream. 'It's like skiing at Aviemore,' he said. 'It promises snow but delivers ice.' All of this wouldn't really matter so much if Corinthian was cheap. But, of course, it isn't. The fact is it costs an awful lot of money to over-gild the lily. They have to get it back somehow. Contact Jay Rayner on jay.rayner@observer.co.uk.",

      "body": "<p>There is something in the form and detail of tulips that manages to be beautiful while being outrageously sexy. You cannot hide this in a cloak of horticulture or blind botany. From the first, men have lusted after tulips, ruined themselves for possession of them exactly as they have lusted after women. All the great courtesans were tulips. Cleopatra and Marilyn Monroe were tulips. The full curve of hip and buttock with tuck of waist is drawn in satin petals. The admiration is sexual more than aesthetic, and there is more than a touch of sexual ambiguity. The folded leaves around the swollen bud are vulval, yet at the same time they are overtly and precisely phallic, knowing no sexual boundaries. Tulips are our temple paintings, a celebration of beauty and sex decorously growing in the safety of the garden. </p> <p>And every year I am surprised by them. I don't really trust the inevitability of them in the way that I do snowdrops, crocuses or daffodils striking the hours of the year as reliably as autumn rainfall. Then they do. But the exceptional thing about tulips is that although they are robust and regular, they never lose their regal intensity. I went to a wedding at a Sikh temple the other day and the bride was dressed in a fabulous ruby gown laced and decked with gold, her hands filigreed with henna - she was a walking 'Abu Hassan' or 'Keizerskroon'. Tulips raise the stakes, pitching the garden into the exotic from the more homely virtues of primroses, violets and daffodils. </p> <p>Tulips come from the scorching hillsides of Turkey and Iran where the drainage is brutally sharp, the winters surprisingly harsh and dry. It is astonishing that they grow so well in our sodden climate - and doubly so in my own quagmire of a garden. We have a batch of 'Queen of the Night' in our herb beds, where the winter wet and odd bouts of frost have done for half a dozen rosemary bushes and reduced the sage to sorry rags, yet the tulips are back with a cocky vengeance, now in their fifth year. </p> <p>'Queen of the Night' has a satiny purple head with plum-shaded depths balanced on a smoky green stem. In our garden she is juxtaposed against forget-me-nots and the new leaves of lovage, fennel coming through in her last week (she lasts for about two good weeks) and the emerging buds of the hornbeam hedge opening daily behind her. There are eight beds edged with box, and the tulips peak out above that frame. What works - I feel like a New Labour apparatchik talking about flowers 'working' - is that there is only one variety of tulip in this area. Mix'n'match and you diminish tulips utterly. You are as likely to mix tulips up together successfully as you are to get a good drink by sloshing half a dozen different great wines together. </p> <p>What also works (I'm in the groove now) is the fresh lime green of the new growth. Most tulips look better against the backdrop of spring green. Many people have commented on the successful relationship between tulips and euphorbias, mainly because euphorbias such as E palustris, E polychroma and E amygdaloides purpurea all have intense acid-green 'flowers' as well as their spring foliage. In our spring garden, with its euphorbia backing band, we have 'Spring Green', a viridflora tulip with ivory petals and what the trade calls 'feathered green' - a soft green blaze along each petal. There are also some T sylvestris - bright yellow with pointy petals, all clean lines - and 'West Point', another lily-flowered tulip with primrose-yellow pointed petals. </p> <p>Lining the lime walk are lily-flowered 'White Triumphator', their simplicity enhanced by the massed effect. Like all white flowers, they look best in shade. In our walled garden, all pastels and whites, we have 'Carnaval de Nice', a double latte and white, with a raspberry ripple splashed on it. I am not sure if I like it - but I'm happy to go on coming to a decision for a few years yet. And among the emerging cardoon leaves is 'negrita', a plum-coloured flower with rather thin leaves. </p> <p>But it is the Jewel garden where most of the tulips are and, to be honest, we should have had a lot more. But our chronic inability to order things at the right time and then the ridiculousness of the wet just when they should have been planted did for the best-laid plans. Of all the flowers that grow, tulips are the most jewel like, both in intensity of colour and tone and in opulence. </p> <p>Working for 10 years dressing women with jewels taught me how earrings or a brooch can lift and transform every stitch of clothing. Tulips have that effect on a border. There is 'Queen of Sheba', a burnished, Burmantoft red edged with orange. The other side of the main path is 'Abu Hassan', described in the catalogue as 'dark mahogany', which it isn't, but it does evoke that verbal struggle for richness. Like all triumph tulips, it is thick stemmed and ideal for cutting, although it is hard to take a single one from the garden. It makes sense to have a cutting area just for that purpose and to leave the border tulips well alone. </p> <p>Then there are the parrots. The oddest thing about tulips is that they are most treasured in their aberrations. Diseased, misshapen, the tulips that really inspired market madness were the 'broken' ones - offspring of monochromatic tulips that have been infected with a virus spread by aphids, causing streaking and stippling of the petals. Growers have even used radiation on the bulbs to induce mutation, engineering freaks for the show. If tulips are a glorious celebration of sex, then the parrots rejoice in decadence. To me, a parrot tulip looks as though it has just been hit by a bullet, the petals flayed and ripped on the exit, but otherwise scarcely touched. </p> <p>We have 'Blue Parrot', which is the colour of red paint water with a blue brush dipped in; 'Black Parrot', which is not black but instead the richest shade of burgundy. Opened out it is like a frosted portwine stain on a window. We also have 'Rococco', vermilion corrupted by a puckered scar of greeny blue, and 'Orange Favourite', which has green blotches and a yellow base and is, I am horrified to learn, possibly 'on its way out'. What can this mean? Why? </p> <p>'Orange Artist' is a member of the viridiflora group and is among my favourite tulips of all, an orange flower streaked lividly with purplish, greenish grey on a thick chocolate stem. 'Princess Irene' is less showy, more orange streaked by a distinctly purple splash at the base of each petal. The freakiest of the lot is T acuminata, a species tulip with small petals like yellow and vermilion twists of paper, a flower on fire and although beautiful, curiously stripped of sex. You need the curves.</p> <p><strong>My roots: A week in Monty's garden</strong></p> <p>Like most people, over the Easter weekend I had my first sustained period in the garden this year. No rain, not much sun but four days of dry soil and the chance to busy and bury myself in it. That is as good as holidays get in my book. The swallows came back and the hedgerow leaves grew by the hour. The first tulips (sylvestris) flowered. The mown grass looked like lawn and not an attempt to cheat winter. It was light till past 8.30pm. I dream of all this through winter and </p> <p>it never lets me down, gets better each year.</p> <p>One of the things I like most about stretches in the garden is that I can enjoy mundane things such as mowing the grass, weeding, sweeping paths or giving the greenhouse a really good soak. Perhaps the measure of how much you love an activity is how boring the chores seem. In my own garden, there are no boring chores. But I did tackle a few bigger jobs.</p> <p>One was to move all the red and white currants and most of the gooseberries from their existing position tucked away in a corner of the garden. For the past couple of years they have suffered dreadfully from sawfly, defoliating bushes in a matter of days. I do use pyrethrum, but reluctantly, and it is damage limitation rather than prevention or cure. So I dug a new piece of ground where the westerlies will rip into a sawfly before it can rip into the currant bushes. Our blackcurrants are looking very healthy this year. Last year the birds got the lot, so I have put all the currants together and will net them in due course.</p> <p>We have been working in the Jewel garden, moving grasses that have got too big, rearranging, weeding, cutting back, putting in more box hedging - all without disturbing the tulips and alliums that are so important to it. It is getting late for this kind of work and would have been better done in the autumn, but it was too wet then and there has been no time until now.</p> <p>Lest I appear too smug, I will admit to making the mistake of sowing mangetout peas in soil blocks (I grow all beans, peas and leaf crops in soil blocks now - it gives them a really good, slug-free start) and putting them under the mister in the greenhouse, trying to cheat a few days' start on the germination. But they all promptly rotted. However, I do have a good batch of 'Alderman' peas outside and I have replaced the mangetouts with another batch, this time in the dry.</p> <p><strong>Your roots: When to plant out your tulip bulbs </strong></p> <p>The best time to plant tulips is November, but make a list now from the ones you see and like. Put the order in late summer. We got most of ours from <a href=\"mailto:peternyssenltd@btinternet.com\">Peter Nyssen</a> (0161 747 4000). I have left our tulips in the ground for the past few years. But if you lift the bulbs after the leaves have died back, you can plant the garden throughout the year without damaging dormant bulbs.

      "body": "<p>And so, with a mighty thump of newsprint on doormat, the battle for Saturday is renewed. Last year the Times sought to catch up with the Telegraph. Now the Guardian - three magazines, three walloping tabloids, two broadsheets and more sections than you can count before breakfast - seems to be trying to gazump them both. You can hear the familiar dinner party refrain already: 'Frankly, I mean ... who's got time to read all this'? </p> <p>There's a simple answer to that. Some dozen or so years back, Saturday sales were the runts of most circulation litters. Then the truth of a changing society dawned. Sunday shopping, all-night shopping, four-day weeks, flexible working... The Saturdays that editors had grown up with had changed utterly. They had become about leisure as well as family chores. They were, in marketing-speak, the 'new Sunday' - with reading time to match. </p> <p>Thus, on the sixth day, our dailies grew almost exponentially.

      "bodyText": "And so, with a mighty thump of newsprint on doormat, the battle for Saturday is renewed. Last year the Times sought to catch up with the Telegraph. Now the Guardian - three magazines, three walloping tabloids, two broadsheets and more sections than you can count before breakfast - seems to be trying to gazump them both. You can hear the familiar dinner party refrain already: 'Frankly, I mean ... who's got time to read all this'? There's a simple answer to that. Some dozen or so years back, Saturday sales were the runts of most circulation litters. Then the truth of a changing society dawned. Sunday shopping, all-night shopping, four-day weeks, flexible working... The Saturdays that editors had grown up with had changed utterly. They had become about leisure as well as family chores. They were, in marketing-speak, the 'new Sunday' - with reading time to match. Thus, on the sixth day, our dailies grew almost exponentially. The worst sales morning of the week became the best. Price resistance crumbled, too: you could add pennies as well as sections on Saturday and not notice a drop. Nor, significantly, did the second dinner party tune - the one about not needing a Sunday paper because there was so much left over to read from Saturday - appear to work in practice. Sunday sales held up stoutly. People who loved their papers didn't choose: they bought - nay, devoured - both. A tale of triumph amid the gloom? Up to a point.

      "body": "<p>The British political class adores America. Like a sad old man who fears his young wife will seek her pleasures elsewhere, our \u00e9lite will give the United States whatever she wants if she will only massage the fragile national ego. ('Say our relationship is special, really, really special. Say it! Now say it as if you mean it! ') Lindis Percy - a radical pacifist midwife and grandmother - is less enchanted. As a peace campaigner, she protests outside US bases. As a citizen, she asks by what legal authority America occupies British territory?</p> <p>It's a good question. The 1945 Labour Government handed land to America without public and Parliamentary debate and without a treaty specifying reciprocal obligations. A Whitehall briefing note from the Treasury Solicitor, which Percy found in public records, confirmed what everyone suspected: RAF officers at the bases and, by extension, their elected masters in Westminster have no power to stop the Americans launching operations which are against Britain's national interest.</p> <p>Percy has been arrested and jailed many times for her curiosity. Last week she was on trial at Harrogate Magistrates' Court. Her crime was to have protested outside 'RAF' Menwith Hill - which is, in fact, the 13th Field Station of the US National Security Agency. She had draped a Stars and Stripes on the road outside. On it she had written 'George W. Bush... oh dear'. A military vehicle went over the flag, and the driver, the Ministry of Defence Police maintained, became the victim of 'a racially motivated crime' (proving once again that political correctness is an authoritarian conservative's dream).</p> <p>Her racism took a terrible toll on the American. 'He was quite visibly distressed to drive over his national emblem, which he holds particularly dear,' the prosecutor, Gregor Purcell, told the court. I would have thought that if you're a soldier of a foreign power working in a colonial outpost, you should be a little less precious. Judge Peter Nuttall may have thought the same. In any event, he cleared Percy on Friday.</p> <p>The questions she raises won't go away as easily. Menwith Hill, near the Yorkshire Dales, and a second US base, 'RAF' Fylingdales on the North Yorkshire Moors, are essential elements of George W Bush's plans to build the 'son of Star Wars' defence against ballistic missiles.</p> <p>No one near power in Britain supports Star Wars - apart from William Hague and Iain Duncan Smith, who are little more than displaced American nationalists (and whose closeness to power is debatable to say the least). Whitehall has always maintained that defence policy must uphold multilateralism, not unilateralism; that nuclear weapons are a deterrent; and that anyone who disagrees is some kind of traitor undermining patriots' efforts to defend the country they love.</p> <p>In 1994 Tony Blair proved he was fit to join respectable society when he told his party conference that, whatever delegates said, the next Labour administration would support deterrence and multilateral disarmament. The odd Leftist cried 'betrayal' - Blair had once been a member of CND. But with the Cold War over, the leader could argue that multilateralism would bring a safer world. Russia could be persuaded to decommission her dangerously unstable warheads and prevent the export of nuclear technology. The Chinese military could be calmed. The terrifying possibility of an arms race between India and Pakistan could be averted.</p> <p>The Americans are destroying all his hopes and shredding Establishment certainties which had flourished for half a century. Deterrence theory holds that if you have nuclear weapons no enemy will launch a nuclear attack for fear of a terrible reprisal. Bush needs the electronic eavesdropping technology at Menwith Hill and Fylingdales to track ballistic missiles and shoot them down before they reach the US. America can attack without fear of retaliation. Multilateralism is based on honouring international treaties. Bush will unilaterally renounce the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the cornerstone of nuclear arms control, as he develops Star Wars.</p> <p>As for love of country, the Yorkshire of the moors, dales and Bettys Caf\u00e9 Tea Rooms, which Hague claims to love, will become a target for any enemy of the United States. If the Americans were to shoot down a missile over Britain, it wouldn't disappear like a blip on a computer game, but shower the country with radioactive debris. You need to have an intense dislike of the British in general and Yorkshiremen in particular to contemplate going along with Bush.</p> <p>The Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence are worried sick that Russia and China will be pushed into militarism and xenophobia. The generals say that Bush's attempts to sell the idea to his allies by pretending Star Wars can protect Western Europe are ludicrous: it's too expensive and can't be made to work.</p> <p>But Blair refuses to be a patriot. He will not tell the Americans that Britain will not allow its hospitality to be abused. Desperate Ministers have told me in apparent seriousness that they expect the planning departments of Harrogate Council and the North Yorkshire Moors National Park Authority to enter the world of international diplomacy in the PM's place and prevent the Americans expanding Menwith Hill and Fylingdales.</p> <p>Last month Harrogate Council considered a planning application to install battery-charging houses at RAF Menwith Hill. They will power the Space-Based Infra Red System the Americans will use to identify warheads. The objections of 200 people weren't considered, and elected councillors didn't debate the application. That bogus 'RAF' in RAF Menwith Hill has its uses. The base is on Crown Land and it is a Royal prerogative of the Crown to exempt itself from democratic scrutiny. Monarchical Britain's archaic constitution and the interests of the American Republicans suit each other well. 'We have no control,' said a council spokeswoman. 'There's nothing we can do to stop them.'</p> <p>Harold Best, the Labour MP for Leeds North West, took the last available option. He wrote to Geoff Hoon, and asked the Defence Secretary to open up the secret process by holding a public inquiry into the expansion of Menwith Hill. Hoon and Best are old friends. Hoon forgot their friendship and decided it would be politic in this instance to ignore the request.</p> <p>Tony Blair likes to project himself as a strong leader rather than a pathetic old man. But to hang on to America's affections, he is prepared to reverse the U-turn he made in 1994 and leave the defence of deterrence, multilateralism and patriotism to Lindis Percy. Cynics say that politicians always break their promises. But Blair is in a league of his own. He's betrayed his betrayal.</p> <p><b>Time to arrest this development</b></p> <p>The May day 'riots' of last year weren't riots at all. They were an undoubted success for the police. No one was hurt. Most of the 7,000 or so demonstrators were peaceful, and officers never lost control of the few who weren't.</p> <p>The protest would have been remembered for the gentle wit of anti-capitalist marchers who dug up the lawn in Parliament Square and planted pot plants, were it not for a tiny detail. The triumph of crowd management was marred when some berk sprayed slogans on the Cenotaph. Reality was overtaken by images of disgusting revolutionaries getting away with dishonouring the memory of the dead.</p> <p>If a war memorial had been painted in the provinces, few would have noticed. But the graffiti was in the backyard of editors and broadcasters. They ignored the Met's successes and condemned officers for their flabby permissiveness.</p> <p>It is scarcely original to say that image matters more than substance. But then Sir John Stevens, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, is scarcely an original man. In the past few days, Stevens and the press have egged each other on like bullies preparing themselves to thrash the living daylights out of their target.</p> <p>'Anarchist fanatics plan to bring mayhem to Oxford Street on May Day, police warned' (the Mirror ). 'Sir John Stevens urged law-abiding demonstrators to stay well clear of disturbances by \"violent extremists\"' (the Mail ). 'A thousand hardcore protesters plan to spread violence across London during anti-capitalism demonstrations on May Day, Scotland Yard warned' (the Express ). 'Anarchists plotting May Day mayhem have been training at American action camps, police said yesterday. Up to 50 British extremists are thought to have been on courses to learn urban guerrilla tactics for causing disruption' (the Mirror again).</p> <p>Listen to the language - 'militants', 'urban guerrillas', 'extremists' and (very modern) 'hardcore' - and look at the 'wanted' pictures on the news pages. Good policing is calm and proportionate. Good officers know that 'zero tolerance' can be dangerous intolerance and concentrate on the basics of preventing crime and preserving order.</p> <p>I've no doubt that some protesters would welcome a fight, but what we're hearing from Stevens and his new friends in the press is menacing and hysterical. Officers on duty will be wound-up like springs, as will their adversaries. If there are anarchist deaths, they won't be accidental.</p>",

As for love of country, the Yorkshire of the moors, dales and Bettys Caf\u00e9 Tea Rooms, which Hague claims to love, will become a target for any enemy of the United States. If the Americans were to shoot down a missile over Britain, it wouldn't disappear like a blip on a computer game, but shower the country with radioactive debris. You need to have an intense dislike of the British in general and Yorkshiremen in particular to contemplate going along with Bush. The Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence are worried sick that Russia and China will be pushed into militarism and xenophobia. The generals say that Bush's attempts to sell the idea to his allies by pretending Star Wars can protect Western Europe are ludicrous: it's too expensive and can't be made to work. But Blair refuses to be a patriot. He will not tell the Americans that Britain will not allow its hospitality to be abused. Desperate Ministers have told me in apparent seriousness that they expect the planning departments of Harrogate Council and the North Yorkshire Moors National Park Authority to enter the world of international diplomacy in the PM's place and prevent the Americans expanding Menwith Hill and Fylingdales. Last month Harrogate Council considered a planning application to install battery-charging houses at RAF Menwith Hill. They will power the Space-Based Infra Red System the Americans will use to identify warheads. The objections of 200 people weren't considered, and elected councillors didn't debate the application. That bogus 'RAF' in RAF Menwith Hill has its uses. The base is on Crown Land and it is a Royal prerogative of the Crown to exempt itself from democratic scrutiny. Monarchical Britain's archaic constitution and the interests of the American Republicans suit each other well. 'We have no control,' said a council spokeswoman. 'There's nothing we can do to stop them.' Harold Best, the Labour MP for Leeds North West, took the last available option. He wrote to Geoff Hoon, and asked the Defence Secretary to open up the secret process by holding a public inquiry into the expansion of Menwith Hill. Hoon and Best are old friends. Hoon forgot their friendship and decided it would be politic in this instance to ignore the request. Tony Blair likes to project himself as a strong leader rather than a pathetic old man. But to hang on to America's affections, he is prepared to reverse the U-turn he made in 1994 and leave the defence of deterrence, multilateralism and patriotism to Lindis Percy. Cynics say that politicians always break their promises. But Blair is in a league of his own. He's betrayed his betrayal. Time to arrest this development The May day 'riots' of last year weren't riots at all. They were an undoubted success for the police. No one was hurt. Most of the 7,000 or so demonstrators were peaceful, and officers never lost control of the few who weren't. The protest would have been remembered for the gentle wit of anti-capitalist marchers who dug up the lawn in Parliament Square and planted pot plants, were it not for a tiny detail. The triumph of crowd management was marred when some berk sprayed slogans on the Cenotaph. Reality was overtaken by images of disgusting revolutionaries getting away with dishonouring the memory of the dead. If a war memorial had been painted in the provinces, few would have noticed. But the graffiti was in the backyard of editors and broadcasters. They ignored the Met's successes and condemned officers for their flabby permissiveness. It is scarcely original to say that image matters more than substance. But then Sir John Stevens, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, is scarcely an original man. In the past few days, Stevens and the press have egged each other on like bullies preparing themselves to thrash the living daylights out of their target. 'Anarchist fanatics plan to bring mayhem to Oxford Street on May Day, police warned' (the Mirror ). 'Sir John Stevens urged law-abiding demonstrators to stay well clear of disturbances by \"violent extremists\"' (the Mail ). 'A thousand hardcore protesters plan to spread violence across London during anti-capitalism demonstrations on May Day, Scotland Yard warned' (the Express ). 'Anarchists plotting May Day mayhem have been training at American action camps, police said yesterday. Up to 50 British extremists are thought to have been on courses to learn urban guerrilla tactics for causing disruption' (the Mirror again). Listen to the language - 'militants', 'urban guerrillas', 'extremists' and (very modern) 'hardcore' - and look at the 'wanted' pictures on the news pages. Good policing is calm and proportionate. Good officers know that 'zero tolerance' can be dangerous intolerance and concentrate on the basics of preventing crime and preserving order. I've no doubt that some protesters would welcome a fight, but what we're hearing from Stevens and his new friends in the press is menacing and hysterical. Officers on duty will be wound-up like springs, as will their adversaries. If there are anarchist deaths, they won't be accidental.",

The project to secure the exclusion of the Conservatives from power for a generation has withered as Blair's enthusiasm for changing the Westminster voting system has shrivelled. In terms of the private goals he set for his premiership, the most evident failure has been Europe. Towards Europe as a whole, and towards the single currency especially, public opinion is more aggressively hostile than ever. The greatest wrangling between the Prime Minister and the Chancellor about the next manifesto is not over what it says about tax, but about the warmth of the phraseology towards the single currency. The fiercest struggle about that is within Mr Blair himself. Will he hedge his self-perceived destiny with deadening qualifications or will he articulate the belief that his epochal role is to make Britain a fully engaged partner in Europe? The Blair government has demonstrated that it can make history. Only in its second term will we discover whether it has the capacity to change the future.",

'I only ever expected to work hard if I came here. No one ever mentioned benefits or housing and I have not applied for them. Britain is a freer country than Turkey and I can work. That is why I came.' He shares a two-bedroom flat with five other men. They pay the rent of \u00a3300 a week in cash. 'One reason that these people do not get identified is that our society is open and deregulated,' said Jordan. 'There are very few internal controls and there is a very good chance that you will avoid detection in any sphere. 'The benefits regime, for so long a point of political controversy, simply appears to be irrelevant,' said Jordan. 'If people can get work in the shadow economy, they don't encounter the benefits system at all.' The only use of benefits detected by researchers was either when British co-workers sold an immigrant a national insurance number, or when immigrants married a Briton. Experts believe that there may be up to a quarter of a million illegal immigrants in Britain. Most recent research into the attitudes of immigrants to Britain has focused on the views of asylum seekers because they are registered and easily identifiable. Jordan and his colleagues, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, found their respondents through community networks and also by joining workplace 'raids' carried out by the Immigration Service. ben.summerskill@observer.co.uk",

Having been persuaded against his judgment to act as a translator for the Home Office on behalf of refugees, the 22-year-old student was exhausted and traumatised. </p> <p>He looked across the table at the 17-year-old who was trying to explain for the third time how Nepalese police had tortured him, and turned to the Home Office interviewer sitting calmly flicking through his notebook. 'I told the interviewer I couldn't understand what this man was saying,' said Reynolds. </p> <p>'I'd been honest that what I spoke was fairly fluent village Nepalese, but this man's life seemed to be in real danger and I couldn't convey that. I'd accepted the job because I'd been told I wouldn't need to know anything complex or political - but this man was telling me his life depended on him being able to stay in Britain for reasons I couldn't understand.' </p> <p>The man from the Home Office was unmoved. 'He was calm and unruffled by the obvious chaos in front of him,' Reynolds said. 'He advised me to paraphrase what the man said and simplify if need be. He said that if the interviewee disagreed with the transcription of the interview after the judgment had been passed, he could always appeal.' </p> <p>Reynolds's experience is far from uncommon: an Observer investigation has discovered that the Home Office routinely employs untrained and inexperienced translators for asylum interviews in contradiction to explicit government legislation. </p> <p>'Potential interpreters are interviewed by staff at the Central Interpreters Unit or at one of their local offices before being accepted on to the panel,' said a Home Office spokeswoman. 'The only exception to this rule is when someone is already working for another government department, the local police force or is a well-qualified professional interpreter.' </p> <p>Reynolds, an anthropology student at Newcastle University, had not spoken Nepalese for almost two years and was not interviewed or even given a contract before being sent to Liverpool and confronted by asylum-seekers with tales of violence and terror. He simply replied to an email from Sakura Communications, a local interpretation unit employed by the Home Office to supply translators to Immigration and Asylum offices. </p> <p>'I told Sakura exactly what level my Nepalese was at,' said Reynolds. 'They weren't bothered and gave me a brief description of the job on offer. When I asked if they wanted to meet me, they said that wasn't necessary.' </p> <p>Three days later Reynolds found himself in the staffroom of Liverpool's Immigration and Asylum office. 'All the others were in their thirties and professional translators. They were shocked to see me but one took me aside and gave me a crash course in words he told me I'd need, like oppression, pain and danger. He told me the name of the outlawed Maoist party the asylum-seekers would support and made sure I at least had a dictionary.' </p> <p>Over 70 per cent of asylum-seekers to Britain are refused entry, a decision appealed against by most of them but upheld in over 80 per cent of cases. The Government cites these statistics as proof of its stringent interviewing procedures, but the experiences of Reynolds and others persuaded to act as unqualified translators has left the Home Office facing questions over how seriously it tries to understand the plight of those appealing for help. 'It seems unlikely to me that either of the men I translated for will get asylum,' said Reynolds. 'The system obviously wanted to get rid of them as soon as possible. They didn't seem bothered whether these people got a fair trial or not.' </p> <p>Veronica Oakeshott, a politics student at Newcastle University who also spent a year in Nepal, answered an advert by Sakura in the student newspaper. 'I explained that I wasn't fluent but the person they'd had lined up for the job had been sacked the day before and she was obviously desperate,' said Oakeshott. 'I was given no trial or interview - they just told me to go to the office in Leeds, but nobody indicated what the job was going to be. I was shocked: I didn't think I would be involved in crux of whole thing.' </p> <p>She was told to translate legally-binding Home Office statements into Nepalese for the refugees to sign. 'I told the Home Office interviewers again and again that I could not do it but they just wrote that in their scripts and told me to carry on.' </p> <p>At the end of the day, Oakeshott rang Sakura and explained her difficulties, telling them she did not want to return the next day as she had previously agreed. 'The same woman laid this massive guilt trip on me and said it would be impossible to find another translator in time. She said the refugees were relying on me; that they had already booked their train tickets, despite not having any money to speak of. </p> <p>'I felt the Home Office was going through the motions. They obviously had a huge backlog but didn't seem to care that I couldn't do the job. I was in a horrible position; I decided not to go back but I felt completely traumatised by the experience.' </p> <p>When The Observer rang Sakura, claiming to be a student interested in translation work, Geoff Heron, the office manager, confirmed the students' claims. 'We try to employ only native speakers but we also have a number of undergraduates and postgraduates on our books because sometimes it's an emergency process. </p> <p>'No qualifications are necessary although we always make sure translators know exactly what they'll be doing.

      "byline": "John Gibb",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>We have been told about Cherie the fierce, protective mother, and we know all about Cherie the power behind the Prime Minister who looks out of place in a formal suit. But what do we know about her career at the Bar? This woman is a serious barrister, a Silk making at least \u00a3250,000 a year in human rights legislation and employment law. Although we rarely hear about it, she spends every available moment following her career.</p> <p>So where is she? It's not easy to find out. The dead-eyed man at the information desk in the Royal Courts of Justice in London won't tell you, and don't even think of asking her chambers or the press office at Number 10, but I've managed to discover that Cherie Booth QC is due in the Court of Appeal this cold February morning and her client is a Nigerian chief from Lagos called Humphrey Idisi.</p> <p>By 10.30am, she is on her feet in Court 69. Below the judicial bench, the well of the court and the public seats have all the corporate charisma of a conference room of a Forte Travel Lodge hotel. It is a light, airy chamber, pale oak furnishings, bland carpet, functional. There are no jury seats; this is where the judiciary makes all the decisions.</p> <p>The three Lord Justices sit above the proceedings, their hollow faces illuminated by green-glass reading lamps and their less impressive lower parts hidden behind thick panelling. It's hard to tell if they are perched high above the court so they can look down on the participants or whether their self-imposed isolation is for their own protection.</p> <p>This is a story of false imprisonment, mock executions, piracy and an attempt to strangle the Russian ambassador to Nigeria. To add to the drama, we are in the presence of a star. This is not only because of Booth's reputation as an advocate, but also because of the barrier erected between the Prime Minister's wife and a fascinated public.</p> <p>For some reason, probably because it was one of their first briefs, details of the appeal were issued by her new chambers, Matrix, on 7 May last year. It was announced that Ms Booth will be representing Chief Humphrey Idisi, a Nigerian businessman with considerable influence in his country, and his companies, Lonestar Drilling and Lonestar Overseas Limited. Idisi is appealing against a judgment handed down in the High Court by Justice Langley last November.</p> <p>The appeal concerns the alleged 'imprisonment' of the Ukrainian crew of a cargo vessel called the Dubai Valour, from which oil rigs and drilling equipment had been lost during a storm off the Cape of Good Hope. It is alleged the crew were held prisoner and harshly treated over a period of 18 months while Chief Idisi attempted to claim \u00a312m in compensation from her owners. When the Russian ambassador went to intercede on the crew's behalf, it is further alleged that Chief Idisi personally attempted to strangle him.</p> <p>The ship owners, Gulf Azov, then successfully sued Idisi for the return of the \u00a33m it paid for the release of the ship and for damages relating to the imprisonment of its crew and the impounding of its vessel. The court was satisfied that the evidence against Idisi was so overwhelming that there was no prospect of him establishing a defence, and the ship owners won the case without a trial.</p> <p>Chief Idisi is now claiming in the Court of Appeal that the allegations against him amounted to accusations of torture and crimes against humanity. His case is that these accusations should have been tested before a jury and it is an infringement of his human rights. When I called Idisi in his office in Lagos and asked him how it had happened that he was being represented by Cherie Booth QC, he said: 'This is an important case for me and my company. I wanted the best, and you cannot get better than the Prime Minister's wife.'</p> <p>When I arrive, Booth is standing in the front of the well of the court with her juniors and instructing solicitors around her. Graham Dunning, counsel for Gulf Azov, sits at the back, eyebrows raised, taking notes and looking professionally astonished. The appeal is listed for two days, and Booth is in the middle of a submission about the conditions in which the Ukrainian crew had been kept. There had been stories of starvation and mock executions by Idisi's men. Booth seems ill at ease. From time to time, she stops to search for a letter or a statement. Occasionally she drops bundles of papers on the floor while her junior, Bita Bhalla, a smart-looking black barrister with grizzled grey hair, pink shirt and stiff white collar, scrabbles about on the carpet.</p> <p>The repartee between Ms Booth and the Bench is more in the nature of a conversation than a dispute. She tends to speak in a chatty rather than a dramatic way, occasionally dropping the odd Lancastrian vowel. Her point is that her client's arrest of the crew was perfectly legal and that they were in fact looked after in an exemplary manner by the chief and the Nigerian police.</p> <p>I am surprised at the way she frequently talks over the judge and vice versa. This is not a technique which one would ever see in a criminal trial at the Old Bailey. On the long bench above the court, the wigged and bespectacled Lord Justices Brooke, Longmore and Buckley are not smiling. Chief Idisi has already been sentenced to three months in prison in his absence for contempt of court. In other words, he has ignored the High Court judgment against him.</p> <p>In the end, their Honours retire for a month to consider their verdict while Cherie and her retinue depart into the Gormenghastian depths of the High Court and across the large yard towards Chancery Lane. She seems utterly at ease, gesticulating and laughing with her clients as she goes. Judgment is finally handed down on 9 March and is in all respects against Chief Humphrey Idisi.</p> <p>There is no argument about the brilliance of Cherie Booth QC. Brought up in Liverpool, her ascent to Bar stardom was the culmination of a long struggle. Her father Tony, a bit-part actor known for his heavy drinking, his womanising and his willingness to perform in films such as Confessions of a Taxi Driver, left his wife Gale when Cherie was seven years old. Times were hard, Gale gave up her acting career and was forced to work in a chippie to make ends meet while Cherie blossomed at Seafield Convent Grammar School in Crosby, coming out with straight As. She continued her academic career at the London School of Economics, where she graduated with a first-class degree in law. Oliver Welch, a fellow student, describes her as 'focused'. 'She was clever, and slightly aloof. People were wary of her.' In 1976, she came top in the Bar finals and immediately went to Derry Irvine (now her husband's Lord Chancellor) as a pupil at his chambers in 2 Crown Office Row.</p> <p>Irvine was a successful barrister specialising in employment and Trade Union law. He insisted that most of his pupils should be academically gifted and highly qualified, but after snapping up Booth, he made an exception to his rule and took on the young Anthony Blair, who came to him after scraping through the Bar finals with a modest third. It was not long before Booth and Blair started walking out together and the romance turned into history.</p> <p>But it was Blair to whom Irvine eventually offered the tenancy while Cherie Booth went off to George Carman at New Court. This was a strange decision by Irvine. Cherie Booth was known to be brilliant. She had the gift of being able to quickly dissect complex legal problems and a natural talent for analysis and strategic decisions. Irvine claimed she left before he could make her an offer.</p> <p>According to a circuit judge who knew him well, Blair was an average hack who had the priceless gift of charm; he was personable, amusing and considerably more clubbable than the reticent, slightly prickly Booth. Cherie Booth's time at New Court was not a success. She was unable to specialise in the areas such as human rights and employment law which interested her. In 1992 she left Carman and went to join Michael Beloff at 4-5 Grays Inn Square, one of the biggest and best sets in London. Beloff was immediately impressed with her. 'She made as great an impression on me in the first five minutes as anyone ever has,' he recalls. 'She played the whole thing beautifully and made her pitch without being conceited in any way.'</p> <p>Booth's career took flight, and she began to flourish at the Bar. She took Silk in 1995 when she was only 40 and started to pick up high-profile employment cases, such as that of Martin Neary, the Westminster Abbey organist who was dismissed.</p> <p>In March 1998, she was hired by the brewers Shepherd Neame to represent it in an action against the government. It was an application for leave to appeal against a judgment which had been made in favour of the Chancellor's decision to increase excise duty on beer. The brewers and, in fact, the entire brewing industry were outraged at the disparity of treatment between the UK and the member states. The case had originally been handled by Michael Beloff, but he was forced to withdraw, and when brewery director Stuart Neame was offered Cherie Booth as an alternative, he jumped at the chance. When I ask him why, he immediately replies, 'Publicity, old boy, publicity.'</p> <p>Cherie Booth had little to do. Before she even stood up in court, Lord Justice Richard Scott said, 'We've read your written submissions and we agree with you' and granted the brewery the right to appeal. Much to Neame's delight, the story finished up on the front pages of most of the papers. Booth never uttered a word in open court as the court had been persuaded by written argument.</p> <p>In 1999, Booth and a small coterie of successful barristers from 4-5 Grays Inn Square started to plot the formation of a new and revolutionary law firm. The idea was to create a medium-sized set of chambers with no more than 37 members which would offer a complete law service. There would be no 'Head of Chambers' - it would be managed by a democratically elected committee of members and would aim to reflect the legal requirements of the new millennium. Booth had much to do with establishing the core values: public-service ethic, innovation, cross-fertilisation of service and ideas, teamwork, etc. It was the antithesis of the traditional chambers. Clerking would be done away with and replaced with an administrative staff to manage members' practices, handle marketing, etc. They employed Shandwyck, the PR consultancy, to handle the media frenzy which would no doubt accompany the launch. All that was missing was a title, and after a day of deliberation, someone came up with the name Matrix.</p> <p>I spend an afternoon at Matrix HQ in Griffin Building, an old police station on the corner of Grays Inn and Clerkenwell roads. The reception is dominated by a translucent desk which changes colour from soft, reassuring pink to blue to yellow every 30 seconds. Members - no one is referred to as a partner - walk around in jeans and shirtsleeves, offices are glass panelled, there is an open-plan administration room inhabited by smiling PAs. A small room with a telly and a few armchairs is used by exhausted members as a common room. There are no ashtrays.</p> <p>The legal profession will take many years to shed its old image. Much was made about Michael Beloff's recent decision to join them before he inexplicably changed his mind and decided to return to his old set at 4-5 Grays Inn Square. Could it be that he feels more comfortable in a traditional environment rather than the new age, ground-breaking Matrix?</p> <p>I next bump into Booth a month later in Court 74 in the Court of Appeal on 27 March. The little chamber, tucked away at the top of the East Wing of the RCJ, is packed. The plaintiff is a 53-year-old teacher by the name of Shirley Pearce who had been persecuted by her pupils at Mayfield Secondary School in Portsmouth. Pearce is a lesbian, and the verbal and physical abuse to which she was subjected in the early 90s was the result of the children learning of her sexuality and persecuting her for it. No steps to protect her or discipline those responsible appear to have been taken by the school. When her working life became so intolerable that she was forced to go to the headmaster for help, his response was to tell her to 'grit her teeth or run away'. When the chairman of the governors wrote to say that she 'must have realised that [she] risked abuse', Pearce went to an industrial tribunal claiming sexual discrimination.</p> <p>The claim was rejected on the grounds that she was discriminated against because of her sexuality, not because of her gender. The appeal, which Pearce is funding personally, is opposed by Hampshire Education Authority and the governors of Mayfield School, who briefed Cherie Booth to represent them. The legal issues revolve round the law relating to human rights and sex discrimination. Booth claims that the Tribunal judgment was correct because neither the sex discrimination legislation nor the Human Rights Act has been drafted to accommodate this particular anomaly. Laura Cox QC is acting for the plaintiff, and the appeal has created a great deal of interest in the gay community. The public benches are thronged with grey-haired female ramblers and thin, bald men in black suits, while fresh-faced women wearing bikers' leathers stalk the corridors outside. The two male judges, Lord Justice Henry and Lord Justice Judge, adopt bleak, slightly appalled expressions throughout the proceedings and remain mostly silent. The third member of the bench, Lady Justice Hale, delivers terrifying questions while adopting a sinister smile in the manner of a head prefect who has caught a fifth former with a packet of Benson &amp; Hedges. 'Ms Booth, are you really asking us to believe?' etc.</p> <p>Booth makes her points eloquently and seems on much surer ground among the intricacies of human rights, sexual discrimination and employment legislation. 'It is the government to blame, not my client,' she says. 'The Sex Discrimination Act is not capable of legislating on matters of sexual orientation. What have the public authorities done to infringe the plaintiff's human rights? We say, nothing at all.'</p> <p>Both teams have to prepare final submissions during the lunch hour. Booth and her junior retire to the crowded public snack bar for a tuna sandwich as they scribble away; papers in piles on the table and all over the floor by their feet.</p> <p>I have begun to realise that Booth is oblivious to her appearance in court. She gives the impression that she has clothed, fed and dispatched her kids and her husband, washed up, slapped on lipstick, grabbed her wig and gown and just made it in time for a five-hour bout of legal argument before rushing back to fix the tea.</p> <p>Today, she is wearing a horsehair frieze-top barrister's wig from which one of a pair of the 'babies' (curls) stitched to the tail has gone missing, a white collarett and bib, a Queen's Counsel's black gown, a black worsted jacket with gauntlet cuffs and a formal waistcoat - all from Thresher &amp; Glenny of 67 Chancery Lane. Jewellery is minimal: a red-gold wedding band, a chunky silver ring, a bracelet and a pair of small, heart-shaped diamond earrings.</p> <p>She arrives in court carrying a bottle of Volvic mineral water and a packet of Kleenex tissues and keeps her private documents in a Silk's red brief bag. Her nails are unvarnished. Her hair is black with auburn tints. While she appears neat and tidy first thing, she is a habitual fidget and indulges herself with constant movement - swivelling to talk to her junior, shifting her position on the hard benches, screwing up her features as if squinting into the distance, taking her watch off and playing with it, stifling yawns, pulling her ear and dragging her hand down her face. Her habit of scratching her scalp results in her wig shifting back on her head, leaving stray locks showing in the front and dislodging the occasional strand so it hangs down across her cheek. By 3.40pm, the wig has become completely askew, endowing her with a rakish appearance at odds with the po-faced solemnity of the court.</p> <p>At the end of the day, after judgment has been reserved and their Lordships have departed, Cherie turns to talk to her junior and passes him a pile of papers and files from her bench. She yawns, looks at her watch and begins to disrobe in court. Her gown, jacket and waistcoat are discarded down to a revealing black v-neck sweater, over which she slips a less formal jacket and coat, ready to make a break for it out of the private entrance in Carey Street where her car awaits. As she leaves, she turns to me and says, 'Are you following me around?' 'Yes,' I tell her.</p> <p>The Shirley Pearce appeal lasts three days and is inconclusive, the three Lord Justices reserving judgment and making the point that many other appeals are in the pipeline. It's hard to understand why the appeal had come to court at all.</p> <p>Whatever one says, the fact that Cherie Booth is the Prime Minister's wife is bound to have an effect on her clients and may affect some of the judiciary, who either react against her in order to show their independence or slobber unctuously over her because she is a celebrity. While this attitude is unfortunate but probably unavoidable, there is no sign that it has affected her cases, or that her career as a barrister is suffering. Her appearance at a judicial revue on 9 April representing an inmate at the Personality Disorder Unit in Ashworth Special Hospital is an illustration of the earnings potential of the Human Rights Act. The appellant, her client Adrian Ng, a Chinese national, has been an inmate in the Personality Disorder Unit at Ashworth for 15 years. Ng, who has apparently become a model patient, was convicted of the ritual slaughter of Mai Tai Tang and her two children at The Old Bailey in November 1984. He claimed in court that he had been 'possessed by gods' and was detained indefinitely in a secure hospital.</p> <p>Ashworth, Rampton and Broadmoor are where our most dangerous men and women are kept, and security in these establishments is compatible with Category B prisons, although the inmates are mentally ill and therefore technically not criminally responsible. Ng is objecting to the monitoring of his private telephone calls by hospital staff, claiming that it infringes his human rights. The judgment will be made principally on written submissions and the review consequently requires only one day of the court's time.</p> <p>A judicial review can be used to examine whether a decision made by a public authority - in this case, the Department of Health - is irrational, unreasonable or a breach of the principle of proportionality. The hearing is presided over by His Honour Justice Newman, and Booth is up against the Department of Health and Ms Aswini Weerera representing Ashworth Hospital. She has been retained by Nigel Leslie, a solicitor who specialises in human rights and mental health.</p> <p>Booth makes the point that the hospital's policy of monitoring 10 per cent of private telephone conversations is incompatible with Article 8 of the Human Rights Act which entitles the individual to privacy and family life. The Department of Health argues that security considerations are such that it is vital to remove any right to privacy on the telephone. In the past, there have been numerous public inquiries into Ashworth as a result of the discovery of active paedophile rings, pornography and drugs in the hospital. The Department of Health barrister says there is a compelling need for telephone monitoring because of the special circumstances which exist in these places, the manipulative nature of many of the inmates, and the need to avoid drugs becoming more readily available.</p> <p>'The Secretary of State has taken a step too far,' says Booth. 'The telephone is my client's only link with the outside world. He feels - with justification - that if a conversation with, for instance, his sister, is overheard and forms part of an analysis of his mental state by a member of staff, it could be taken out of context and he will have no redress. He should have the right of private conversation with members of his family.'</p> <p>When the court adjourns, the proceedings disintegrate into informality. 'I really must visit one of these places,' says Booth. Another lawyer jokes, 'Well, smoking pot and hanging out at Ashworth Hospital sounds interesting', and Ms Weerera adds, 'Actually, I think temazepam seems to be the drug of choice at Ashworth.'</p> <p>Booth remarks coyly: 'I see there's a tranche of mental-health cases coming up, but it's nothing to do with me. Why are there so many photographers hanging around outside?' she asks me.</p> <p>'It's the judgment on the Kilshaws' adoption appeal,' I tell her, and when I mention that the judge has halted the trial of the Leeds footballers in Hull because of an article published in the Sunday Mirror and that it's enough to make you give up journalism, she suggests, 'Well, why not try something more honourable?'</p> <p>Nigel Leslie, the instructing solicitor, says Booth's greatest skill lies in her ability to get to the legal heart of the case. 'She's easy to work with, gets on with it. No aloofness. You feel that she loves her job. We started from a very difficult position in this case and finished in a position of strength. I'm happy.'</p> <p>Booth takes an active part in the running of her chambers and spends time sitting as a recorder in the Crown Court. While she sees this as a public duty, it could also be the first step towards becoming a member of the judiciary. No one knows. Many women find her silence to be disappointing. A spirited and opinionated woman such as Booth could achieve much if she spoke out on behalf of working women in this country. 'She's a good role model, in particular for women at the Bar,' says Helena Kennedy QC. She has to work at being a professional in a tough job, she has to appear at her husband's side at often inconvenient times, and she has to be a housewife and mother. It is hard to know where she could find the time to be an ambassador for women as well.</p> <p>Personally, she is a strange mixture of highly opinionated politician and domestic goddess. She has lost weight, joined a gym and become reconciled at occasionally leaving the anonymity of the Bar to become a public figure with an expensive wardrobe and a travelling hairdresser. Her stylist Andre Suard at Michaeljohn, in the West End, is one of a handful of top crimpers able to get away with \u00a390 for a cut and has Kirsty Young, Melanie Griffiths and Barbara Dixon among his clients. Booth has used him for more than five years, but you won't see her in Michaeljohn's smart salon because since 1997 Andre has travelled to her.</p> <p>When public figures such as Cherie Booth go out of their way to remain anonymous, they sometimes create a mystique about themselves which encourages speculation and untruths. No doubt she understands this perfectly well and has considered the odds, and no doubt she thinks it's worth the risk.</p>",

      "bodyText": "We have been told about Cherie the fierce, protective mother, and we know all about Cherie the power behind the Prime Minister who looks out of place in a formal suit. But what do we know about her career at the Bar? This woman is a serious barrister, a Silk making at least \u00a3250,000 a year in human rights legislation and employment law. Although we rarely hear about it, she spends every available moment following her career. So where is she? It's not easy to find out. The dead-eyed man at the information desk in the Royal Courts of Justice in London won't tell you, and don't even think of asking her chambers or the press office at Number 10, but I've managed to discover that Cherie Booth QC is due in the Court of Appeal this cold February morning and her client is a Nigerian chief from Lagos called Humphrey Idisi. By 10.30am, she is on her feet in Court 69. Below the judicial bench, the well of the court and the public seats have all the corporate charisma of a conference room of a Forte Travel Lodge hotel. It is a light, airy chamber, pale oak furnishings, bland carpet, functional. There are no jury seats; this is where the judiciary makes all the decisions. The three Lord Justices sit above the proceedings, their hollow faces illuminated by green-glass reading lamps and their less impressive lower parts hidden behind thick panelling. It's hard to tell if they are perched high above the court so they can look down on the participants or whether their self-imposed isolation is for their own protection. This is a story of false imprisonment, mock executions, piracy and an attempt to strangle the Russian ambassador to Nigeria. To add to the drama, we are in the presence of a star. This is not only because of Booth's reputation as an advocate, but also because of the barrier erected between the Prime Minister's wife and a fascinated public. For some reason, probably because it was one of their first briefs, details of the appeal were issued by her new chambers, Matrix, on 7 May last year. It was announced that Ms Booth will be representing Chief Humphrey Idisi, a Nigerian businessman with considerable influence in his country, and his companies, Lonestar Drilling and Lonestar Overseas Limited. Idisi is appealing against a judgment handed down in the High Court by Justice Langley last November. The appeal concerns the alleged 'imprisonment' of the Ukrainian crew of a cargo vessel called the Dubai Valour, from which oil rigs and drilling equipment had been lost during a storm off the Cape of Good Hope. It is alleged the crew were held prisoner and harshly treated over a period of 18 months while Chief Idisi attempted to claim \u00a312m in compensation from her owners. When the Russian ambassador went to intercede on the crew's behalf, it is further alleged that Chief Idisi personally attempted to strangle him. The ship owners, Gulf Azov, then successfully sued Idisi for the return of the \u00a33m it paid for the release of the ship and for damages relating to the imprisonment of its crew and the impounding of its vessel. The court was satisfied that the evidence against Idisi was so overwhelming that there was no prospect of him establishing a defence, and the ship owners won the case without a trial. Chief Idisi is now claiming in the Court of Appeal that the allegations against him amounted to accusations of torture and crimes against humanity. His case is that these accusations should have been tested before a jury and it is an infringement of his human rights. When I called Idisi in his office in Lagos and asked him how it had happened that he was being represented by Cherie Booth QC, he said: 'This is an important case for me and my company. I wanted the best, and you cannot get better than the Prime Minister's wife.' When I arrive, Booth is standing in the front of the well of the court with her juniors and instructing solicitors around her. Graham Dunning, counsel for Gulf Azov, sits at the back, eyebrows raised, taking notes and looking professionally astonished. The appeal is listed for two days, and Booth is in the middle of a submission about the conditions in which the Ukrainian crew had been kept. There had been stories of starvation and mock executions by Idisi's men. Booth seems ill at ease. From time to time, she stops to search for a letter or a statement. Occasionally she drops bundles of papers on the floor while her junior, Bita Bhalla, a smart-looking black barrister with grizzled grey hair, pink shirt and stiff white collar, scrabbles about on the carpet. The repartee between Ms Booth and the Bench is more in the nature of a conversation than a dispute. She tends to speak in a chatty rather than a dramatic way, occasionally dropping the odd Lancastrian vowel. Her point is that her client's arrest of the crew was perfectly legal and that they were in fact looked after in an exemplary manner by the chief and the Nigerian police. I am surprised at the way she frequently talks over the judge and vice versa. This is not a technique which one would ever see in a criminal trial at the Old Bailey. On the long bench above the court, the wigged and bespectacled Lord Justices Brooke, Longmore and Buckley are not smiling. Chief Idisi has already been sentenced to three months in prison in his absence for contempt of court. In other words, he has ignored the High Court judgment against him. In the end, their Honours retire for a month to consider their verdict while Cherie and her retinue depart into the Gormenghastian depths of the High Court and across the large yard towards Chancery Lane. She seems utterly at ease, gesticulating and laughing with her clients as she goes. Judgment is finally handed down on 9 March and is in all respects against Chief Humphrey Idisi. There is no argument about the brilliance of Cherie Booth QC. Brought up in Liverpool, her ascent to Bar stardom was the culmination of a long struggle. Her father Tony, a bit-part actor known for his heavy drinking, his womanising and his willingness to perform in films such as Confessions of a Taxi Driver, left his wife Gale when Cherie was seven years old. Times were hard, Gale gave up her acting career and was forced to work in a chippie to make ends meet while Cherie blossomed at Seafield Convent Grammar School in Crosby, coming out with straight As. She continued her academic career at the London School of Economics, where she graduated with a first-class degree in law. Oliver Welch, a fellow student, describes her as 'focused'. 'She was clever, and slightly aloof. People were wary of her.' In 1976, she came top in the Bar finals and immediately went to Derry Irvine (now her husband's Lord Chancellor) as a pupil at his chambers in 2 Crown Office Row. Irvine was a successful barrister specialising in employment and Trade Union law. He insisted that most of his pupils should be academically gifted and highly qualified, but after snapping up Booth, he made an exception to his rule and took on the young Anthony Blair, who came to him after scraping through the Bar finals with a modest third. It was not long before Booth and Blair started walking out together and the romance turned into history. But it was Blair to whom Irvine eventually offered the tenancy while Cherie Booth went off to George Carman at New Court. This was a strange decision by Irvine. Cherie Booth was known to be brilliant. She had the gift of being able to quickly dissect complex legal problems and a natural talent for analysis and strategic decisions. Irvine claimed she left before he could make her an offer. According to a circuit judge who knew him well, Blair was an average hack who had the priceless gift of charm; he was personable, amusing and considerably more clubbable than the reticent, slightly prickly Booth. Cherie Booth's time at New Court was not a success. She was unable to specialise in the areas such as human rights and employment law which interested her. In 1992 she left Carman and went to join Michael Beloff at 4-5 Grays Inn Square, one of the biggest and best sets in London. Beloff was immediately impressed with her. 'She made as great an impression on me in the first five minutes as anyone ever has,' he recalls. 'She played the whole thing beautifully and made her pitch without being conceited in any way.' Booth's career took flight, and she began to flourish at the Bar. She took Silk in 1995 when she was only 40 and started to pick up high-profile employment cases, such as that of Martin Neary, the Westminster Abbey organist who was dismissed. In March 1998, she was hired by the brewers Shepherd Neame to represent it in an action against the government. It was an application for leave to appeal against a judgment which had been made in favour of the Chancellor's decision to increase excise duty on beer. The brewers and, in fact, the entire brewing industry were outraged at the disparity of treatment between the UK and the member states. The case had originally been handled by Michael Beloff, but he was forced to withdraw, and when brewery director Stuart Neame was offered Cherie Booth as an alternative, he jumped at the chance. When I ask him why, he immediately replies, 'Publicity, old boy, publicity.' Cherie Booth had little to do. Before she even stood up in court, Lord Justice Richard Scott said, 'We've read your written submissions and we agree with you' and granted the brewery the right to appeal. Much to Neame's delight, the story finished up on the front pages of most of the papers. Booth never uttered a word in open court as the court had been persuaded by written argument. In 1999, Booth and a small coterie of successful barristers from 4-5 Grays Inn Square started to plot the formation of a new and revolutionary law firm. The idea was to create a medium-sized set of chambers with no more than 37 members which would offer a complete law service. There would be no 'Head of Chambers' - it would be managed by a democratically elected committee of members and would aim to reflect the legal requirements of the new millennium. Booth had much to do with establishing the core values: public-service ethic, innovation, cross-fertilisation of service and ideas, teamwork, etc. It was the antithesis of the traditional chambers. Clerking would be done away with and replaced with an administrative staff to manage members' practices, handle marketing, etc. They employed Shandwyck, the PR consultancy, to handle the media frenzy which would no doubt accompany the launch. All that was missing was a title, and after a day of deliberation, someone came up with the name Matrix. I spend an afternoon at Matrix HQ in Griffin Building, an old police station on the corner of Grays Inn and Clerkenwell roads. The reception is dominated by a translucent desk which changes colour from soft, reassuring pink to blue to yellow every 30 seconds. Members - no one is referred to as a partner - walk around in jeans and shirtsleeves, offices are glass panelled, there is an open-plan administration room inhabited by smiling PAs. A small room with a telly and a few armchairs is used by exhausted members as a common room. There are no ashtrays. The legal profession will take many years to shed its old image. Much was made about Michael Beloff's recent decision to join them before he inexplicably changed his mind and decided to return to his old set at 4-5 Grays Inn Square. Could it be that he feels more comfortable in a traditional environment rather than the new age, ground-breaking Matrix?

Her stylist Andre Suard at Michaeljohn, in the West End, is one of a handful of top crimpers able to get away with \u00a390 for a cut and has Kirsty Young, Melanie Griffiths and Barbara Dixon among his clients. Booth has used him for more than five years, but you won't see her in Michaeljohn's smart salon because since 1997 Andre has travelled to her. When public figures such as Cherie Booth go out of their way to remain anonymous, they sometimes create a mystique about themselves which encourages speculation and untruths. No doubt she understands this perfectly well and has considered the odds, and no doubt she thinks it's worth the risk.",

He looks more like a university lecturer than an executive earning almost half a million pounds a year, or a man who would rather be in his garden shed tinkering with his chemistry set than playing the media mover and shaker. </p> <p>As such he embodies the split personality of the channel he has presided over since 1997. Channel 4 is a public sector creature with a commercial alter ego. It has to satisfy the critics who want top-quality programmes but it has to fund those programmes in the real world. </p> <p>Right now, he can relax a little. On Tuesday he will unveil a beefy rise in revenue and profitability that may go some way to offsetting last week's downbeat audience figures (C4's share fell to 9.3% in the first quarter). Advertising revenue in the last three months is up, he adds, despite the difficult environment (ITV has watched ad spend decline). </p> <p>But even income in excess of \u00a3700m is insufficient for Jackson's ever-expanding ambitions. He reveals that the network will now go to the City for more cash. Channel 4 is demonstrably upping its commerciality whether or not it is dumbing down. </p> <p>The timing of the announcement is fortuitous if not planned. Chris Smith hassaid if Labour wins the election C4 will remain in the public sector. But Jackson's plans to raise money, through share offerings in a package of subsidiaries if necessary, will undoubtedly renew calls for privatisation of the whole. </p> <p>Jackson knows this, but says he will consider anything that will protect the business, in the way that he was prepared to pay anything to protect Friends and ER for C4 - the station coughed up \u00a3120m. 'You have to have a battering ram to launch a new station,' says Jackson. E4, the new pay TV spin-off, which is premiering the new series at the moment, has up to 2006 to break even and is expected to absorb \u00a358m of investment. These days, rights to shows are sold with digital rights. Not to have a digital outlet is not a commercially sensible option. E4 has helped push C4's share of the digital audience up by 14%. FilmFour is an acknowledged brand leader and a subscription success story, having won 450,000 viewers since its launch in 1998 (the whole of ONdigital has managed fewer than 1m). </p> <p>But if E4 is Channel 4 'without the shite' - in Ali G's words - perhaps the critics accusing C4 of abandoning its 'quality' image are right. Not to mention its public service remit. Jackson has an interesting take on the definition of public service. For example,of late, he says, he has been mostly thinking about computer games. He has been playing Tank Wars online and is rather taken with the prospect of a C4 games site. </p> <p>Fun, and easy to charge for. You can see where he's going. So what's the public service justification, then? 'Well, we'd be investing in creativity, we'd be investing in companies up and down the country.' </p> <p>So, presumably, the justification for investing in horse racing and a new interactive betting subsidiary, Go Racing, (with BSkyB and Arena, yet to be signed) is the investment in the nation's race courses. </p> <p>Luckily, Jackson has other, arguably stronger arguments at hand. He points to the increased investment in Channel 4 News, which now transmits seven days of the week. There is 4 Learning, with its website Homework High, and a handful of comedy shows that do not make money. There are plans afoot for more business coverage. </p> <p>He says the public receives its dividend from C4 in the form of innovation and, interestingly, in the form of a virtual community. </p> <p>The broadcaster, he says, is keen to provide a central area of common ground for an increasingly 'disaggregated' nation - the stuff of coffee break conversations. </p> <p>Ali G's contribution to the national wealth, goes the thinking, was to hold up a mirror to society. 'That's what Britain was like in the year it was made,' Jackson argues. </p> <p>He boasts that most of the entertainment on the recent night of Comic Relief night hailed from Channel 4: Ali G, Graham Norton and Big Brother . </p> <p>The strength, or weakness, of Jackson's arguments make it obvious that reconciling the traditional idea of public service with modern broadcasting is not easy. </p> <p>But he wouldn't worry about that. Change is his buzzword. Change is what takes up most of his time, either provoking it or nurturing it. </p> <p>Other networks will just have to live with the fact that C4 enjoys a special status. But, like a kid with a celebrity parent, the pressure to perform is enormous. </p> <p>And that costs money. 'We do not receive a penny of public subsidy,' Jackson points out rather forcefully. His job is to spot the future runners and pick them up cheap, which is why he's interested in rally driving, the poor relation to Formula 1. The channel famously won the rights to test-match cricket and, Jackson reveals, is bidding against Sky for the rights to the sport's World Cup in 2003. </p> <p>He is rumoured to be ready to hit the big time. Maybe Hollywood, fuelled by the recent tie-up with Warner Brothers? He bats the question away. 'I'll be doing this so long as it keeps changing,' he says. 'I like new challenges'. Perhaps he's hoping for a Tory victory, with its promised privatisation plans, after all.</p>",

Change is his buzzword. Change is what takes up most of his time, either provoking it or nurturing it. Other networks will just have to live with the fact that C4 enjoys a special status. But, like a kid with a celebrity parent, the pressure to perform is enormous. And that costs money. 'We do not receive a penny of public subsidy,' Jackson points out rather forcefully. His job is to spot the future runners and pick them up cheap, which is why he's interested in rally driving, the poor relation to Formula 1. The channel famously won the rights to test-match cricket and, Jackson reveals, is bidding against Sky for the rights to the sport's World Cup in 2003. He is rumoured to be ready to hit the big time. Maybe Hollywood, fuelled by the recent tie-up with Warner Brothers? He bats the question away. 'I'll be doing this so long as it keeps changing,' he says. 'I like new challenges'. Perhaps he's hoping for a Tory victory, with its promised privatisation plans, after all.",

'There has been a big increase just in the last few weeks.

It looks quite possible that there will be a substantial increase in the figure for this year. It's bad enough to lose a job, but another worrying trend is that some employers are paying less in redundancy packages than they did in the Nineties. </p> <p>'The amounts have really been pared back,' says Jo Bond of Right management consultants. A major reason for this is that employers have become accustomed to making people redundant and no longer throw money at the problem to assuage their guilt. </p> <p>Coles of Drake Beam Morin says employers are now less willing to agree to early payment for staff in final salary pension schemes: 'This is phenomenally expensive for them.

      "bodyText": "Many people who are made redundant do not sign on. 'They associate signing on with long periods of unemployment,' says solicitor Michael Burd of Lewis Silkin. 'Many people just won't do it: they see it as an admission of defeat.' But there are major advantages. 'Everyone should go along to the JobCentre,' says Jeff Masters of the Low Pay Unit. For a start, your entitlement to the basic state pension will be protected. An Age Concern guide, Your Rights 2001-02 , says: 'You will receive credits towards your pension if you are drawing a benefit such as jobseeker's allowance or incapacity benefit. If you are under 60 and seeking work, it may be worth signing on (even if you are not entitled to benefit) because you will receive credits. Many people will qualify for non means-tested jobseeker's allowance. If you have been working for some time you should have enough National Insurance contributions to entitle you to \u00a353.05 a week for up to 26 weeks. To qualify, you must sign a 'Jobseeker's Agreement' and fulfil its conditions about the way you are looking for work. But if you don't have enough NI credits, and have less than \u00a38,000 in savings and other capital, you could qualify for means-tested Job skeer's Allowance. If you are living with an opposite-sex partner, their income and savings will be taken into account as well. (The law favours same-sex couples here by not treating them as a couple.) If you have a mortgage, you can be entitled to help with repayments after nine months of redundancy. For mortgages taken out before October 1995, you get help after four months.",

      "body": "<p>Over tender chicken breast served with saffron rice the talk was of revolutionaries plotting chaos on the streets of London.</p> <p>May Day was still two months away, but the message from the police was clear: there would be no repeat of last year's anarchist riots. As he dined with a succession of newspaper executives, Sir John Stevens, Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, revealed the protesters would be shown no mercy. A zero tolerance approach would crush them. London's monuments would be untouched by vandals. 'We will not allow them to go ahead. They won't be doing it to the Cenotaph again,' he said.</p> <p>Long before the first brick is thrown and the first police truncheon falls, the battle for May Day has raged fiercely - but over the net and in the media, not on the streets.</p> <p>Stevens' lunch tour was the first salvo and launched a police media campaign to portray the protesters as a dangerous threat. Photographs of suspected ringleaders have been circulated freely to the press. Never mind that the people involved have never been identified, let alone charged with any specific offences. Newspapers, eager to run the colourful copy, lapped up the steady stream of scare stories.</p> <p>The anarchists were thousands strong, they wrote; some would carry samurai swords; they had links to the Real IRA; they were being trained in US camps and many were battle-hardened by protests from Seattle to Prague. Police raided an empty south London building they termed a camp for anarchists. They destroyed the squat - and took along a Sunday Telegraph journalist - as they pointed ominously to a graffito on the wall that read, 'Smash police skulls'.</p> <p>London's Mayor Ken Livingstone also joined the fray on the side of the police. He warned protesters to stay away and left no doubt any police action would have his approval. Anita Roddick, founder of Body Shop, was vilified for donating money to training programmes in non-violent protest, but some of the May Day anarchists actually oppose her business.</p> <p>For observers of the tiny British anarchist scene, the hype has been astonishing. 'Not since the anarchist scare of the 1890s has British anarchism had a media profile like this. It is quite amazing,' said political scientist Ben Franks, who wrote a PhD on the subject at Nottingham University.</p> <p>Now thw media skirmishes are over. Physical battle lines will be drawn on Tuesday. Backing up the police public relations offensive is an enormous operation designed to cope with hundreds, if not thousands, of arrests. More than 6,000 officers will be on duty with more on stand-by. Dog units, mounted officers and police helicopters will all be deployed. Police have identified 300 potential targets and plan to defend them all. They will employ undercover 'spotters' who have been memorising the faces of dozens of activists to be arrested on sight.</p> <p>An armoured JCB will remove cars and other barricades while trained climbing specialists will tackle those who scale buildings and chain themselves to public structures. The Cenotaph and the statue of Churchill, daubed and given a mohican haircut of turf during the last protest, will be boarded up.</p> <p>'Anyone who commits any kind of criminal activity will be held to account,' Assistant Commissioner Mike Todd told The Observer: 'They may arrive under the impression that, because there will be so many of them, the police will not be able to deal with them all. That will not be the case.'</p> <p>For many protesters the media onslaught was a shock. It painted a radically different picture to their own small-scale PR campaign that had filtered through to the newspapers via the internet and stickers pasted on walls.</p> <p>Their focus was on Monopoly, a game picked as an ironic symbol of anti-capitalism and an excuse to tour London causing chaos. Websites were set up inviting people to join in, and a mock Monopoly board was created as a guidebook. The idea was simple. It was also funny, as was the fact that the group organising it called itself the Wombles (White Overall Movement for Building Liberation through Effective Struggle). Protests will include musical street parties, water pistols and giant inflatable dice. At first glance, the event would seem to be more like Rio than riot.</p> <p>The police scare tactics were a huge setback. With all the talk of police guns and protesters' swords, there were fears thousands of people would be scared off. Any chance of a tolerant greeting from ordinary citizens also seemed to have disappeared.</p> <p>At a meeting a week ago, closed to the media but attended by an undercover Observer reporter, one of the May Day leaders urged people not to talk to the press. 'We have had our fingers burnt. We have learnt our lessons,' said Andy, whose surname is known only to associates.</p> <p>Not everyone agreed. Other protesters began to emerge, eager to portray themselves in a less sinister light. Emails started arriving in newspaper offices, hitherto obscure groups began to write press releases. Many were from the radical Left, such as Revolution, while anarchist bodies such as Class War remained aloof.</p> <p>The police media campaign, protesters said, was paving the way for violence. By creating the public perception of bloodthirsty anarchists preparing to rampage, they were pre-justifying a planned assault. The police had scores to settle from last year and were looking for any excuse to crack heads.</p> <p>'Some people are preparing for violence on May Day,' said a Revolution statement. 'They are bringing 1,000 outside agitators on top of 5,000 hardened regulars. They will be masked up to conceal their identity, they will be armed to the teeth. They have a planning HQ at New Scotland Yard.'</p> <p>In any battle there are casualties. But in this PR war the victims have been people like Alfred Scott. On May Day, Scott, 25, will take a day off work, don white overalls and a mask and head to Oxford Street. In police terms that is enough for him to be a major target. He fears a bad beating or worse.</p> <p>But the quietly spoken doctor does not look like a threat to the state. Sitting in a north London cafe, he wore a shirt and tie. He has a neat haircut and an accent that would make any middle-class parent proud. But he is afraid. 'Violence is going to happen. The police have assured that. But I am a pacifist by nature. I just want to go along and protest and make my views known,' he said.</p> <p>Those views are the usual mix of left-wing sympathies for the poor and the Third World, an anger at Thatcherism and a feeling that capitalism has not provided an answer to all the world's needs.</p> <p>Ben, a 16-year-old from Watford doing his GCSEs, will also be going. 'I don't pretend to have a lot of political knowledge, but a lot of things are being ignored in the world, that are not known about and should be. Third World poverty appals me,' he said.</p> <p>It is not radical stuff, but the flames of violence have been so fanned over the past week that Scott will be bringing his first aid kit on the march. 'People are going to get hurt, I know it. I feel that I have to use my knowledge of medicine to help people when the police attack them,' he said.</p> <p>But the innocent protesters do hide an extremist hard core bent on violence. The Monopoly board concept masked a serious intent. Last year the protesters were contained by police in Trafalgar Square. It hampered their attempts to cause real disruption and allowed hundreds to be corralled together and filmed by police cameramen. A widespread Monopoly tour of the capital would ensure that such an event did not happen again.</p> <p>'Last year was really considered a failure by some. But this year we will have 20 to 30 events going off all over the place at the same time. It will not be a failure again,' said Charlie, who has been attending protests for two years.</p> <p>Many of the hard core will be the same people behind the violence last year. Thought to number little more than 50, there is a strong contingent linked to the Kurdish community, which is supportive of Turkish Communist groups, and also the Italian anarchist group Ya Basta. Others come from British groups such as Class War or the anti-roads campaign, Reclaim The Streets, which organised last year's protests. Sprinkled among them will be a few militant environmentalists, such as Green Anarchists and Earth First, and hardline revolutionary Communists.</p> <p>These are the activists who make up the real leadership of the Wombles and they intend to dress in the white-padded overalls first used on Italian protests. Few of their full identities are known. One of the leading Wombles is Lunghi, whose first name is a mystery. Police know only that he is Italian-born and believe he is dangerous. After May Day, the Wombles will disband. Next year they will be back in a new guise.</p> <p>For these people, much of the Monopoly board is just a diversion. The real trouble could start anywhere at anytime and violence is on the agenda. Many of the groups attending the protests swim in the crowded but tiny pond of left-wing extremist politics.</p> <p>The only way to guarantee coverage of their groups is to make sure the media get the pictures they want. Peaceful protests rarely generate good television. Smashed windows and smashed heads do.</p> <p>'If it went off peacefully there would be nothing in the newspapers. That would be no fun,' said Stephen Micaoel, an anarchist poet and squatter.</p> <p>Many of the Wombles agree. One of their leaders, Mike, knows it is inevitable. He does not consider damage to property to be violent. It is political expression. 'Violence involves giving pain to another live being. A window does not feel pain,' he said.</p> <p>Shops across the capital, from McDonald's to a west London fur shop, from Mayfair hotels to Coutts Bank, are braced for the worst. None has plans to close for the day, but if the worst comes to the worst their shutters will come rattling down. All have drafted in extra security.</p> <p>Amid the smoke and mirrors of the pre-protest media sparring match only one thing has become clear - no one now expects a peaceful demonstration. In that respect, police and hard core protesters could both get what they want. The police will arrest hundreds and the demonstrators will be splashed across every front page. The Battle for May Day would have been won by extremism on both sides. Only people like Alfred Scott would have lost.</p> <p><b>Mayday the cast</b></p> <p>Starring...</p> <p><b>SIR JOHN STEVENS plays the big sherriff: </b>As the top cop in town, it is Sir John's task to defend the city against the barbarian horde descending on its innocent citizens.

Next year they will be back in a new guise. For these people, much of the Monopoly board is just a diversion. The real trouble could start anywhere at anytime and violence is on the agenda. Many of the groups attending the protests swim in the crowded but tiny pond of left-wing extremist politics. The only way to guarantee coverage of their groups is to make sure the media get the pictures they want. Peaceful protests rarely generate good television. Smashed windows and smashed heads do. 'If it went off peacefully there would be nothing in the newspapers. That would be no fun,' said Stephen Micaoel, an anarchist poet and squatter. Many of the Wombles agree. One of their leaders, Mike, knows it is inevitable. He does not consider damage to property to be violent. It is political expression. 'Violence involves giving pain to another live being. A window does not feel pain,' he said. Shops across the capital, from McDonald's to a west London fur shop, from Mayfair hotels to Coutts Bank, are braced for the worst. None has plans to close for the day, but if the worst comes to the worst their shutters will come rattling down. All have drafted in extra security. Amid the smoke and mirrors of the pre-protest media sparring match only one thing has become clear - no one now expects a peaceful demonstration. In that respect, police and hard core protesters could both get what they want. The police will arrest hundreds and the demonstrators will be splashed across every front page. The Battle for May Day would have been won by extremism on both sides. Only people like Alfred Scott would have lost. Mayday the cast Starring... SIR JOHN STEVENS plays the big sherriff: As the top cop in town, it is Sir John's task to defend the city against the barbarian horde descending on its innocent citizens. Does not like swords. ANITA RODDICK plays the damsel in distress: She's got double trouble, after getting mixed up with training camps for protesters. But some of the marchers hate Body Shop anyway. KEN LIVINGSTONE plays the turncoat: Marvel as he becomes an unexpectedly staunch ally of the police and foe to the protesters. He saw the writing on the wall and went with the boys in blue. RONALD MCDONALD plays the dastardly villain: Ronald claims he is miscast, but protesters are convinced his company ruins people's health and want to wipe the smile off his face. ...and not forgetting the chief attraction: THE WOMBLES!",

Bush's administration - 100 days old today - is being hailed as his country's most ideologically right-wing of the past 100 years, across a spectrum of policies ranging from the environment to labour, civil rights to social issues.</p> <p>But the rip tide that cuts beneath all Bush's plans to transform the landscape, with more durable results than any other policy, is the hijacking - behind closed doors - of the US judiciary.</p> <p>The administration - to which power was in effect granted by the Supreme Court in a controversial ruling last December - is preparing not only to set the highest court in the land on course for a conservative generation, but has quietly revolutionised the way in which all federal judges are appointed to benches across the country, guaranteeing politically right-wing selections.</p> <p>At the core of this manoeuvre, which will weave a new fabric in US society, is a tightly organised right-wing lawyers' group which has come in from the fringes to the core of the administration.</p> <p>It is called the Federalist Society, of which Bush's Solicitor General Theodore Olson, Interior Secretary Gale Norton, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham and Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Orrin Hatch are leading members - as are many members of the new White House counsel team.</p> <p>Stalwart conservative judges on the Supreme Court Anthony Scalia and Clarence Thomas are patrons and guests of the group, and Attorney General John Ashcroft is a close affiliate.</p> <p>The emergence of the Federalists is traced in a study by the New York-based Institute for Democracy Studies, which concludes that 'extreme conservative organisations sponsoring a combination of right-wing litigation and advocacy are opening the way for a radical transformation of the American legal system'.</p> <p>Ralph Neas, President of the Washington think-tank People for the American Way, says that 'the White House counsel's office and the Department of Justice are being turned over to the Federalist Society, a bastion of far-right legal thought'.</p> <p>The Federalist Society's philosophy underpins, and is ready to steer, all the administration's cornerstone policies on deregulation of environmental and labour law, education, civil rights and abortion. The author of the IDS study, Julie Gerchik, says that 'the agenda is to dismantle everything built since the New Deal'. There was even a Federalist panel in Chicago on 28 March entitled 'Rolling Back the New Deal'.</p> <p>'Where is the divide between politics and the law here?' says Gerchik. 'This is politics enforced by legal mechanisms.'</p> <p>The society has already had an impact on major decisions: when Bush pulled America out of the Kyoto treaty on climate change, he did so after reading what he called 'important new information'. That information was a report commissioned by David McIntosh, a Federalist Society founder, arguing that toxic emissions were exaggerated and warning of costs to business.</p> <p>But above all, the society has ousted the legal establishment which - in the form of the profession's traditional representative body, the American Bar Association - has helped oversee the selection of judges and guarantee the profession's integrity for five decades.</p> <p>Since Eisenhower, the ABA has had a semi-official role in advising on judicial appointments. But in a sudden, little-noticed move last month, President Bush cut the ABA entirely out of the appointment process. The Federalists were delighted, having for years targeted the association (in a special publication, ABA Watch) for such issues as its support for gun control and opposition to the death penalty.</p> <p>The ABA's removal creates a vacuum in the recommendation of judges, and into it has moved a 15-person committee formed between the White House and Justice Department urgently to seek candidates for some 100 vacancies to federal benches (one-eighth of all judges).</p> <p>This recommending committee is firmly in the hands of the Federalist Society, controlled by Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson, a society member, and others. Sources add that some 70 judges have so far been interviewed, a quarter of them recommended by the Federalist Society.</p> <p>The society was founded 20 years ago with a mission to beat back what it saw as a liberal orthodoxy permeating public policy and the courts since the Civil Rights movement.</p> <p>Society members propelled the attempted impeachment of President Clinton over the Lewinsky scandal. Prosecutor Kenneth Starr was an active member, as were many of his team.</p> <p>Its major benefactor is the Scaife Foundation, controlled by billionaire conservative magnate Richard Mellon Scaife, who deploys his fortunes to advance right-wing causes. Among those causes was the 'Arkansas Project', initiated by Scaife at a cost of $24 million to mount the suit by Paula Jones - and eventually Lewinsky - against the President.</p> <p>The first meeting between Scaife and the 'Arkansas Project' was chaired by Theodore Olson, who steered it and is now Solicitor General of the US, the country's most influential lawyer, head of the Federalist Society's Washington chapter, based in the White House.</p> <p>Olson cut his teeth under Starr in the Reagan administration, and was counsel to Reagan during the Iran-Contra affair. He was himself investigated (but not indicted) by a special prosecutor for lying to Congress, and went on to become chairman of the American Spectator magazine, which 'broke' the Paula Jones story. His wife Barbara is a pivot of the Washington right-wing social circuit, herself chairwoman of a conservative women's organisation funded by Scaife.</p> <p>From this background, Olson emerged into the public glare as George Bush's knight and mouthpiece, triumphantly arguing the President's case against the Florida recounts in the Supreme Court and ultimately winning him the election.</p> <p>The Federalists' other channel to power has been through clerkships at the Supreme Court under sympathetic judges Scalia, Thomas, Kennedy - and Chief Justice William Rehnquist.</p> <p>Many saw Bush's victory as a watershed moment when the judges put politics above the law. But it is to the future of the court over the next four years - and thence a generation - that the Federalists are looking.</p> <p>The backgrounds of the Supreme Court's main conservatives are contentious: Justice Rehnquist was author of the memo during the historic Brown vs. Board of Education case in 1952 supporting racial segregation, saying: 'It is about time the court faced the fact that white people in the South don't like the coloured people'.</p> <p>But Rehnquist and the court's other conservatives have always toiled in counterpoint with liberal appointees and moderate Republicans. However, only this week, a 5-4 verdict on an apparently innocuous case about driving licences in Alabama cut a major inroad into the 1964 Civil Rights Act, ruling that individuals cannot now sue federal agencies over discrimination cases.</p> <p>In the hands of Bush's legal team now are two possible appointments during his term of office which could swing the court decisively to the right.</p> <p>The Federalists are not the only group taking care to ensure a conservative federal judiciary. Three right-wing organisations funded by the Scaife Foundation have organised a series of junkets so that judges can attend political seminars on the advantages of deregulation in environment, labour and civil rights law.</p> <p>They are the Law and Economics Centre, the Liberty Fund and FREE - the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment, which funded all-expenses-paid trips, some lasting as long as two weeks, to luxury venues, featuring golf and horse-riding for the justices.</p> <p>As well as money from the ubiquitous Scaife family, both the FREE and the LEC trips for judges are bountifully funded by oil giants Shell and Exxon, and Philip Morris cigarettes.</p> <p>Many of the judges who enjoyed them failed - by their own admission - to disclose these junkets on their annual financial reports, as required by their own federal ethics laws, according to the Washington-based watchdog group Community Rights Counsel.</p> <p>The CRC found that judges' attendance at the junket seminars 'increased significantly between 1992 and 1998' with a record 88 judges taking trips in 1998. With 800 active judges at any time, this means that about 10 per cent of the federal judiciary takes a trip each year.</p> <p>An exhaustive study by the CRC of seminars and subsequent verdicts by judges who attended them finds 'doctrinal shifts' and 'considerable evidence that the education judges receive' has led to 'a strand of judicial activism that is distinctly pro-market, clearly hostile to federal environmental regulations and decidedly in keeping with the curriculum of FREE seminars'.</p>",

But the rip tide that cuts beneath all Bush's plans to transform the landscape, with more durable results than any other policy, is the hijacking - behind closed doors - of the US judiciary. The administration - to which power was in effect granted by the Supreme Court in a controversial ruling last December - is preparing not only to set the highest court in the land on course for a conservative generation, but has quietly revolutionised the way in which all federal judges are appointed to benches across the country, guaranteeing politically right-wing selections. At the core of this manoeuvre, which will weave a new fabric in US society, is a tightly organised right-wing lawyers' group which has come in from the fringes to the core of the administration. It is called the Federalist Society, of which Bush's Solicitor General Theodore Olson, Interior Secretary Gale Norton, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham and Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Orrin Hatch are leading members - as are many members of the new White House counsel team. Stalwart conservative judges on the Supreme Court Anthony Scalia and Clarence Thomas are patrons and guests of the group, and Attorney General John Ashcroft is a close affiliate. The emergence of the Federalists is traced in a study by the New York-based Institute for Democracy Studies, which concludes that 'extreme conservative organisations sponsoring a combination of right-wing litigation and advocacy are opening the way for a radical transformation of the American legal system'. Ralph Neas, President of the Washington think-tank People for the American Way, says that 'the White House counsel's office and the Department of Justice are being turned over to the Federalist Society, a bastion of far-right legal thought'. The Federalist Society's philosophy underpins, and is ready to steer, all the administration's cornerstone policies on deregulation of environmental and labour law, education, civil rights and abortion. The author of the IDS study, Julie Gerchik, says that 'the agenda is to dismantle everything built since the New Deal'. There was even a Federalist panel in Chicago on 28 March entitled 'Rolling Back the New Deal'. 'Where is the divide between politics and the law here?' says Gerchik. 'This is politics enforced by legal mechanisms.' The society has already had an impact on major decisions: when Bush pulled America out of the Kyoto treaty on climate change, he did so after reading what he called 'important new information'. That information was a report commissioned by David McIntosh, a Federalist Society founder, arguing that toxic emissions were exaggerated and warning of costs to business. But above all, the society has ousted the legal establishment which - in the form of the profession's traditional representative body, the American Bar Association - has helped oversee the selection of judges and guarantee the profession's integrity for five decades. Since Eisenhower, the ABA has had a semi-official role in advising on judicial appointments. But in a sudden, little-noticed move last month, President Bush cut the ABA entirely out of the appointment process. The Federalists were delighted, having for years targeted the association (in a special publication, ABA Watch) for such issues as its support for gun control and opposition to the death penalty. The ABA's removal creates a vacuum in the recommendation of judges, and into it has moved a 15-person committee formed between the White House and Justice Department urgently to seek candidates for some 100 vacancies to federal benches (one-eighth of all judges). This recommending committee is firmly in the hands of the Federalist Society, controlled by Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson, a society member, and others. Sources add that some 70 judges have so far been interviewed, a quarter of them recommended by the Federalist Society. The society was founded 20 years ago with a mission to beat back what it saw as a liberal orthodoxy permeating public policy and the courts since the Civil Rights movement. Society members propelled the attempted impeachment of President Clinton over the Lewinsky scandal. Prosecutor Kenneth Starr was an active member, as were many of his team. Its major benefactor is the Scaife Foundation, controlled by billionaire conservative magnate Richard Mellon Scaife, who deploys his fortunes to advance right-wing causes. Among those causes was the 'Arkansas Project', initiated by Scaife at a cost of $24 million to mount the suit by Paula Jones - and eventually Lewinsky - against the President. The first meeting between Scaife and the 'Arkansas Project' was chaired by Theodore Olson, who steered it and is now Solicitor General of the US, the country's most influential lawyer, head of the Federalist Society's Washington chapter, based in the White House. Olson cut his teeth under Starr in the Reagan administration, and was counsel to Reagan during the Iran-Contra affair. He was himself investigated (but not indicted) by a special prosecutor for lying to Congress, and went on to become chairman of the American Spectator magazine, which 'broke' the Paula Jones story. His wife Barbara is a pivot of the Washington right-wing social circuit, herself chairwoman of a conservative women's organisation funded by Scaife. From this background, Olson emerged into the public glare as George Bush's knight and mouthpiece, triumphantly arguing the President's case against the Florida recounts in the Supreme Court and ultimately winning him the election. The Federalists' other channel to power has been through clerkships at the Supreme Court under sympathetic judges Scalia, Thomas, Kennedy - and Chief Justice William Rehnquist. Many saw Bush's victory as a watershed moment when the judges put politics above the law. But it is to the future of the court over the next four years - and thence a generation - that the Federalists are looking. The backgrounds of the Supreme Court's main conservatives are contentious: Justice Rehnquist was author of the memo during the historic Brown vs. Board of Education case in 1952 supporting racial segregation, saying: 'It is about time the court faced the fact that white people in the South don't like the coloured people'. But Rehnquist and the court's other conservatives have always toiled in counterpoint with liberal appointees and moderate Republicans. However, only this week, a 5-4 verdict on an apparently innocuous case about driving licences in Alabama cut a major inroad into the 1964 Civil Rights Act, ruling that individuals cannot now sue federal agencies over discrimination cases. In the hands of Bush's legal team now are two possible appointments during his term of office which could swing the court decisively to the right. The Federalists are not the only group taking care to ensure a conservative federal judiciary. Three right-wing organisations funded by the Scaife Foundation have organised a series of junkets so that judges can attend political seminars on the advantages of deregulation in environment, labour and civil rights law. They are the Law and Economics Centre, the Liberty Fund and FREE - the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment, which funded all-expenses-paid trips, some lasting as long as two weeks, to luxury venues, featuring golf and horse-riding for the justices. As well as money from the ubiquitous Scaife family, both the FREE and the LEC trips for judges are bountifully funded by oil giants Shell and Exxon, and Philip Morris cigarettes. Many of the judges who enjoyed them failed - by their own admission - to disclose these junkets on their annual financial reports, as required by their own federal ethics laws, according to the Washington-based watchdog group Community Rights Counsel. The CRC found that judges' attendance at the junket seminars 'increased significantly between 1992 and 1998' with a record 88 judges taking trips in 1998. With 800 active judges at any time, this means that about 10 per cent of the federal judiciary takes a trip each year. An exhaustive study by the CRC of seminars and subsequent verdicts by judges who attended them finds 'doctrinal shifts' and 'considerable evidence that the education judges receive' has led to 'a strand of judicial activism that is distinctly pro-market, clearly hostile to federal environmental regulations and decidedly in keeping with the curriculum of FREE seminars'.",

      "bodyText": "Two officers working for Britain's most elite police force, the National Crime Squad, have been arrested in a series of raids aimed at smashing a drug ring operating within the organisation. The arrests, the latest in a series of corruptions scandals to dog the organisation, were among 10 made by Derbyshire police in the early hours of Saturday morning. The 10, identified only as five men and five women, all in their thirties and forties, were detained on suspicion of possessing and supplying cocaine and cannabis. Drugs were recovered from three premises that were raided. An NCS spokesman said five of those arrested were serving police officers, four with the Derbyshire force and one with Nottinghamshire Police. Two of those five were currently on secondment to the National Crime Squad's Nottingham Branch Office. The spokesman said: 'The other three are from Derbyshire, although two of those have previously served with the National Crime Squad. All the officers are of constable or sergeant rank.' Bob Packham, Deputy Director General of the National Crime Squad, told The Observer : 'These arrests follow an intensive and covert operation which we in the National Crime Squad initiated after certain information came to our attention. We take this inquiry very seriously indeed and it is being vigorously pursued.' Officers working for the NCS target the higher echelons of organised crime within England and Wales. More than 50 officers have been removed from the National Crime Squad since it was created in 1998 amid allegations of corruption and malpractice.",

'The Government has a vision about what they want London to be like and they're determined to achieve that despite the little people getting in the way. 'We were ignored by the previous government, which was bad enough, but this area has two sorts of poverty now - the poverty of material things and the poverty of complete disempowerment.'

Any more than that and you're kidding yourself. To this end, I am forever idolising 'happy couples'. It's somehow warming to observe other people's happiness, like basking in a second sun. In a skewed way, it makes you realise what feminism is, or should be - women being their definition of 'happy', not yours.

However unkind it sounds, couples like these should be banned. They are bromide in the air supply - depressing, exhausting and desexualising all those who come into contact with them. What's more, this particular Crap Couple has been 'engaged' for more than four years, which seems rather a long time for any bride to be kept in a state of 'ecstatic anticipation'. Sometimes, when drunk, she admits that she wonders if he'll ever marry her at all. </p> <p>I thought of Crap Couple when I read about Jane Andrews, the former aide to the Duchess of York. She is accused of flying into a rage when it became clear that her long-term boyfriend, Tommy Cressman, wasn't going to marry her, and stabbed him fatally. True or not, just reading about it made me wince. Primarily because a man was dead, but also because it struck me that you'd never read about a man accused of stabbing a woman because she wouldn't marry him. Any amount of insane reasons, yes, but not that one. Even today, in 2001, women are still perceived as obsessed hellhags who'd boil any number of bunnies in pursuit of the diamond ring. Indeed, a new study claims that, out of all Europe, British women are the most obsessive about marriage. Men, meanwhile, are still presenting themselves, as the quarry. A 'prize' to be courted, cajoled and won. </p> <p>It's amusing, really, this idea of marriage to a man as a 'reward', kind of like an emotional version of the gold clock company men get for years of loyal service. What I would very much like to know is who decided that 'bachelor' wasn't at least as sad a word as 'spinster'. I would also like to know how it is that the gender so famously led by their genitals has got away with playing so hard to get with their emotions for so long. For far too many men, it seems that marriage is less their way of honouring their love as it is the ultimate thing they can do to shut up the woman they love. Which is grossly insulting, though maybe not as insulting as the men who refuse to marry at all. </p> <p>The subtle insult implied in the lack of enthusiasm on the part of the man is what seems to sting women most. This is the great unsayable. As a rule women don't get upset because they're not married to their men, they get upset because their men don't want to marry them. Which is all to do with horrible men who enjoy winding women up, and stupid women who allow themselves to be wound up in the first place. It's almost definitely where Crap Couples come from, and why so many marriages end in divorce initiated by the woman. In many cases, the woman got what she wanted the day she whisked him up the aisle. The rest is just hell and Ikea.</p> <p>However, in the strange world of the Crap Couple, being divorced is better, less humiliating, than never having been married at all.

      "body": "<p>I put on weight in the sixth form. Before then, if I wanted to have a bet, I had to sneak out of school at lunchtime, ride on a bus for half an hour to a transport cafe, hand over the bet, jump on a bus back, and arrive at school breathless a few minutes before the first lesson of the afternoon. I could, of course, have squandered my stake money on a sandwich; filling, but not fulfilling. </p> <p>On 1 May 1961, life became easier; legal betting shops opened for the first time since the middle of the nineteenth century. The nearest to my school, a short walk away, was a seedy room in the backstreets of Croydon, managed by a formidable middle-aged blonde. When she paid out the winners, her scowl would have petrified a Blackpool landlady. </p> <p>The premises were dingy by government decree; the 1961 Betting &amp; Gaming Act required that licensed betting offices did not encourage loitering. The participants were expected to enter, place a bet, and leave with the alacrity and discretion of a Cabinet Minister visiting a bordello. </p> <p>For more than 100 years, the public had been denied the legal opportunity to wager in cash away from a racecourse. Betting shops flourished in the first half of the nineteenth century, more than 400 operating in London alone, but the Attorney General noted: 'The mischief arising from the existence of these betting shops was perfectly notorious.' The 1853 Betting Houses Act closed them down, and for more than a century government and punters were united in a hypocritical alliance. </p> <p>Betting continued. A labyrinthine network of bookmakers' runners serviced the nation's gambling instinct, and illegal shops continued to operate until they were legalised 40 years ago. </p> <p>Fred Done owns 256 betting shops, and is the largest independent bookmaker in Britain. The recently published 'Rich List' estimated the wealth of Fred and his brother, Peter, at a conservative \u00a378 million, but he began with nothing. In 1959, the 15-year-old Fred worked with his father in the family's bookmaking business. </p> <p>'He traded in Knott Mill, one of the rougher areas of Manchester, under a tarpaulin in a back yard. He would open the shop from 11 to three and from five to seven for the evening dogs. Bets were written on any scrap of paper, with a nom de plume on the back. </p> <p>'We had runners in all of the factories in Trafford Park, one of the biggest industrial complexes in Europe. We would send a taxi round every day, and the bets would be handed over in clock bags.' These were leather bags which, when closed, set the time on a clock, confirming that bets had not been placed after racing had started. </p> <p>'There were no books, there was no income tax, no betting duty. What you had at the end of your day was profit. The only payment you had to make was bribe money to the police, two or three quid a week to keep them off your back. If they were going to raid you, they'd let you know.' Bookmakers' runners, who earned 10 per cent commission on all the bets they collected, were imprisoned automatically for a third offence; when a raid was imminent, substitutes were employed. </p> <p>'Of course, punters were not as well-informed then. I once said I felt sorry for them and my father said, \"If I ever hear you say that again... Always remember, skin 'em and stamp on 'em\".' Limits on multiple bets protected bookmakers from excessive losses. The businesses were highly lucrative and had to be protected from predators. 'I'm choosing my words here. You would get threats and you had to look after yourself. You had to be tough to stay in the industry. We had runners in all the pubs as well, and there was a lot of competition. The pubs were probably worse than the factories to control.' </p> <p>In 1961 Done went to work for the Peters chain of betting shops in Salford, marking up prices, and after a few years he had been promoted to manager of their credit office. 'There was no [security] camera, no till. In those days it was so good that you could allow for the fiddling and still make money. But when betting tax came in and we started trimming the odds, it became a business.' </p> <p>The first five years of High Street betting were the most rewarding, and by the mid-1960s local magistrates had granted an estimated 16,000 licences. Applicants had to prove a knowledge of the business; one of the most compelling arguments was to admit to a couple of prosecutions for illegal bookmaking. </p> <p>John Banks, who owned a chain of betting shops in Scotland, and who later became one of the biggest racecourse bookmakers, described the shops as 'money factories', a description that attracted the Government's interest. In 1966 they introduced betting tax. </p> <p>The following year, Done started out on his own. 'Two weeks after we opened our first shop, foot and mouth struck. I had no cash and thought we wouldn't make it through. Most bookmakers closed, but we kept going with the dogs, and the punters came. They wanted to bet.' </p> <p>One of the first men to realise the potential of betting shops was Cyril Stein of Ladbrokes. He acquired shops, no matter how run down, no matter the location. He moved the licensed premises, refurbished them, and turnover soared. 'Cyril was a man before his time,' says Done. 'I've never liked Ladbrokes. They've always been too aggressive, but I looked up to them. I think they've lost it now.' </p> <p>Betting tax was increased and the Government, under pressure from football pools companies, imposed a 33 per cent tax on the fixed-odds coupons issued by bookmakers. The number of High Street shops began to decline, and now there are just over 8,000. </p> <p>Until the mid 1980s, punters could listen only to an audio commentary on races, provided by the Exchange Telegraph Company. Each region had a commentator with an appropriate accent. 'When the regular man had a day off, a cockney took over. We hated him.' </p> <p>Not until 1986 was regulation relaxed. Television screens were permitted which, a year later, would bring live racing via satellite to the majority of shops. Bookmakers were allowed to have two amusement-with-prizes machines and to provide soft drinks and refreshments. They were permitted to open in the evenings and on Sundays, but duty at 10 per cent (nine from 1996) was driving punters to illegal bookmakers. Still operating in pubs, clubs and factories, they account for a reputed 10 per cent of betting turnover. </p> <p>'The tax killed off big punters in the shops who wanted to bet the odds-on chances, the man who would have \u00a34,000 to win \u00a31,000. Since offshore betting began, some of my biggest customers have been coming into the shop to see the prices and watch the races, but walk outside to call Victor [Chandler, who pioneered offshore betting] to bet on their mobile phones.' </p> <p>Frankie Dettori rode all seven winners at Ascot in September 1996, and the betting industry shuddered. 'I wrote out cheques for \u00a31.5 million. Even my gardener won \u00a310,000 off me.' Bookmakers suffered another blow when the Government introduced the National Lottery six years ago, although a strange logic denied betting shops the right to sell tickets. </p> <p>'The Lottery was a blow. Not necessarily the jackpot, but the scratch cards. They took away significant business.' The advent of off-shore bookmaking, with lower deductions, was the final punch. The Government conceded. </p> <p>Betting duty will be abolished, perhaps as soon as the autumn, to be replaced by a 15 per cent tax on bookmakers' profits. 'If they hadn't done anything,' says Done, 'the number of betting shops would have been halved within five years. Now, I believe there will be an increase in the number of shops. It's an exciting time. I can't wait to get to work in the mornings.' </p> <p>Done closed his credit business a decade ago - too much hard work betting against a shrewd clientele that didn't always pay up - but he will be tempted to start again. 'It's a different business now, with punters using Switch and Delta cards - you don't get knocked. I'll also be looking at starting a fixed-odds coupon for football.' </p> <p>He should do well. Over the years Done's policy of giving more concessions than his rivals has built up a loyal clientele. A Manchester United devotee for more than half a century, Done pays out early those who have backed the Old Trafford team to win the Premier League when they are clear at the top. In 1998 Arsenal finished the season strongly to overtake United for the Championship, a late run that famously cost Done half a million. </p> <p>The government will study the report of the Gambling Review Body, due in July, before contemplating further changes to betting-shop legislation. The Tote want to install their terminals in pubs and clubs, but the betting industry has one of the most efficient lobbies in Parliament. </p> <p>John Brown is chairman of William Hill. Apart from a break of eight months when Grand Met took over the company, he has worked for Hills since 1959. The late William Hill was one of the best-known rails bookmakers of the past century, whose credit-betting company boasted 400,000 clients. Initially sceptical, Hill began to buy betting shops in 1966 and now the company he founded owns 1,500. </p> <p>Brown's father ran a newsagent's shop in the East End of London, and took bets on commission for a local bookmaker. The chairman of Hills, who has bet since he could write a slip, believes that the abolition of betting duty will wipe out illegal bookmakers instantly, boosting turnover. </p> <p>'One of the biggest changes in my time has been the decline in greyhound betting. In the old days, the dogs represented a third of turnover on Saturdays. You would go to work on a Monday and have hundreds of bets to settle from Saturday night's results. Now it's only a couple of dozen. The Greyhound Express closed, and then the tracks decided that results could not be made available race by race at night to outside agencies. That killed it.' </p> <p>Brown, too, is now optimistic about the future. 'I think the betting shop will become a mini Las Vegas. Horse racing will flourish, and dog racing. Betting on football will continue to grow and I think we will see a new generation of slot machines in which the result is not determined within the machine. </p> <p>'If we are paying the Government 15 per cent of profits, we will be able to put in machines that return 95 per cent of stakes to punters.' Numbers games, similar to the Lottery, have proved popular in the last few years. 'We would like the ability to bet on the Lottery, even if we can't sell the tickets. </p> <p>'The number of shops should increase, but I don't think they will become significantly bigger. You will want one on every street corner. It is still the case that 80 per cent of our customers spend less than 10 minutes in the shop. The British public enjoys betting on horse racing and I think the whole business, horses, dogs, everything, will prosper. In one sense, the high deductions of recent years have protected us. They froze out the skilled punter. The big hitters, the really shrewd punters, will come back, and we are going to have to be proper bookmakers again.' </p> <p>Such men were scarce in my youth. I might have put on weight in the sixth form but, strangely, when betting became convenient, every ounce I gained seemed to be matched by the corresponding loss of a pound from my pocket.</p>",

Before then, if I wanted to have a bet, I had to sneak out of school at lunchtime, ride on a bus for half an hour to a transport cafe, hand over the bet, jump on a bus back, and arrive at school breathless a few minutes before the first lesson of the afternoon. I could, of course, have squandered my stake money on a sandwich; filling, but not fulfilling. On 1 May 1961, life became easier; legal betting shops opened for the first time since the middle of the nineteenth century. The nearest to my school, a short walk away, was a seedy room in the backstreets of Croydon, managed by a formidable middle-aged blonde. When she paid out the winners, her scowl would have petrified a Blackpool landlady. The premises were dingy by government decree; the 1961 Betting &amp; Gaming Act required that licensed betting offices did not encourage loitering. The participants were expected to enter, place a bet, and leave with the alacrity and discretion of a Cabinet Minister visiting a bordello. For more than 100 years, the public had been denied the legal opportunity to wager in cash away from a racecourse. Betting shops flourished in the first half of the nineteenth century, more than 400 operating in London alone, but the Attorney General noted: 'The mischief arising from the existence of these betting shops was perfectly notorious.' The 1853 Betting Houses Act closed them down, and for more than a century government and punters were united in a hypocritical alliance. Betting continued. A labyrinthine network of bookmakers' runners serviced the nation's gambling instinct, and illegal shops continued to operate until they were legalised 40 years ago. Fred Done owns 256 betting shops, and is the largest independent bookmaker in Britain. The recently published 'Rich List' estimated the wealth of Fred and his brother, Peter, at a conservative \u00a378 million, but he began with nothing. In 1959, the 15-year-old Fred worked with his father in the family's bookmaking business. 'He traded in Knott Mill, one of the rougher areas of Manchester, under a tarpaulin in a back yard. He would open the shop from 11 to three and from five to seven for the evening dogs. Bets were written on any scrap of paper, with a nom de plume on the back. 'We had runners in all of the factories in Trafford Park, one of the biggest industrial complexes in Europe. We would send a taxi round every day, and the bets would be handed over in clock bags.' These were leather bags which, when closed, set the time on a clock, confirming that bets had not been placed after racing had started. 'There were no books, there was no income tax, no betting duty.

If they were going to raid you, they'd let you know.' Bookmakers' runners, who earned 10 per cent commission on all the bets they collected, were imprisoned automatically for a third offence; when a raid was imminent, substitutes were employed. 'Of course, punters were not as well-informed then. I once said I felt sorry for them and my father said, \"If I ever hear you say that again... Always remember, skin 'em and stamp on 'em\".' Limits on multiple bets protected bookmakers from excessive losses. The businesses were highly lucrative and had to be protected from predators. 'I'm choosing my words here. You would get threats and you had to look after yourself. You had to be tough to stay in the industry. We had runners in all the pubs as well, and there was a lot of competition. The pubs were probably worse than the factories to control.' In 1961 Done went to work for the Peters chain of betting shops in Salford, marking up prices, and after a few years he had been promoted to manager of their credit office. 'There was no [security] camera, no till. In those days it was so good that you could allow for the fiddling and still make money.

But there may be lessons for both sides from the previously unpublished material about the bitter Hollywood strikes of the Forties.</p> <p>Horne, a history professor at North Carolina University, chooses as his starting point the film industry dispute in 1945 when the Conference of Studio Unions (CSU) went on strike in Los Angeles. It was a highly charged period with strikers confronting police and strike-breakers - one of whom, an actor called Ronald Reagan, recalled later that 'homes and cars were bombed... workers trying to drive into a studio would be surrounded by pickets who'd pull open their car door or roll down a window and yank the worker's arm until they broke it'. Reagan, once a union firebrand himself, crossed the lines and saw the strike as a 'Soviet effort to gain control over Hollywood and the content of its films'.</p> <p>At the time, the Communist Party was strong in California with a membership of around 10,000, second only to New York. Many screenwriters, then more influential than today, were members or supporters. The writers were seen as such a powerful force that the FBI would monitor film content for signs of pro-Soviet or radical bias. They duly kept lists of everyone involved in such films as For Whom the Bell Tolls, Edge of Darkness (about Norwegian patriots resisting the Nazis and starring Errol Flynn) and Keeper of the Flame (a melodrama with Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn). Today the writers are still at loggerheads with the studios, but the battleground has shifted to payment for cable and internet rights and 'intellectual property'.</p> <p>In the Forties, studio chiefs were already concerned about the power of the unions and portrayed demands for better fees as Communist-inspired and part of a plot to control film-making. They hired heavies from mobster associates to break strikes. The gangster Bugsy Siegel, for example, controlled a powerful union of extras.</p> <p>Horne concludes: 'The central - though tacit - metaphor for the postwar United States was the simultaneous rise of organised crime and decline of the organised Left - and the fulcrum of this seesaw was the film industry.'</p> <p>The studios reacted to the CSU's strike with a lockout in 1946. In the anti-Communist mood that swept the country, they were able to take back control and the unions were crushed. Horne sees the strike as a pivotal moment in Hollywood history that shifted for ever the film industry's balance of power and affected everything from the kind of stories that were told to production values.</p> <p>Just as important was the Mob. In the Thirties, gangsters had been brought in by the studios to maintain 'labour peace', but they also established themselves within the unions, looking for rich pickings wherever they might be. As Orson Welles put it: 'A group of industrialists finance a group of gangsters to break trade unionism, to check the threat of socialism, the menace of Communism or the possibility of democracy... when the gangsters succeed at what they were paid to do, they turn on the men who paid them.'</p> <p>Mobster Mickey Cohen claimed that Harry Cohn, the boss of Columbia, had asked for singer and actor Sammy Davis Jnr to be bumped off because it was feared his relationship with the young Kim Novak would harm her marketability. Cohen supposedly relented and merely threatened Davis with the loss of his one good eye if he persisted.</p> <p>The strikes caused splits between writers and actors. Philip Dunne, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of How Green Was My Valley, claimed that Reagan 'postured all over the place' with his claims of picket line violence. Those who crossed the picket included Clark Gable, Esther Williams, Red Skelton, Greer Garson and Mickey Rooney. By contrast, in 1943 Jimmy Cagney, who was close to the Left, took over as leader of the Screen Actor's Guild. Other actors who were prominent in a movement to free a labour organiser, Tom Mooney, included Groucho Marx, Boris Karloff and Clifford Odets.</p> <p>During the strikes, imaginative tactics were employed. Strikers would try to damage box office returns by picketing cinemas and divulging film plots to queuing filmgoers. Pickets outside cinemas showing Lady on a Train told potential customers: 'Ralph Bellamy's the killer. And David Bruce gets the girl.'</p> <p>No one was in any doubt as to what the prize of control would be. A.P. Gianinni of the Bank of America, one of the industry's prime funders, observed prophetically: 'Those who control the cinema can control the thought of the world.'</p> <p>No wonder the strikes were bitterly fought. Photographs from the time show pickets trying to stop strike-breakers entering Warner Brothers in 1946. Disney workers dressed in Mickey Mouse masks picketed cinemas during their 1941 strike. Pickets massed outside Paramount Studios in 1945 and supporting students from UCLA joined them. A sheriff's car was torched outside MGM in 1946.</p> <p>'One movie Hollywood has never produced and probably never will is the story of its own unionisation,' as one of the protagonists quoted by Horne put it. It would be quite a movie.</p> <p>\u0095 Class Struggle in Hollywood 1930-1950 : Moguls, Mobsters, Stars, Reds and Trade Unionists by Gerald Horne (University of Texas Press)</p>",

Horne concludes: 'The central - though tacit - metaphor for the postwar United States was the simultaneous rise of organised crime and decline of the organised Left - and the fulcrum of this seesaw was the film industry.' The studios reacted to the CSU's strike with a lockout in 1946. In the anti-Communist mood that swept the country, they were able to take back control and the unions were crushed. Horne sees the strike as a pivotal moment in Hollywood history that shifted for ever the film industry's balance of power and affected everything from the kind of stories that were told to production values. Just as important was the Mob. In the Thirties, gangsters had been brought in by the studios to maintain 'labour peace', but they also established themselves within the unions, looking for rich pickings wherever they might be. As Orson Welles put it: 'A group of industrialists finance a group of gangsters to break trade unionism, to check the threat of socialism, the menace of Communism or the possibility of democracy... when the gangsters succeed at what they were paid to do, they turn on the men who paid them.' Mobster Mickey Cohen claimed that Harry Cohn, the boss of Columbia, had asked for singer and actor Sammy Davis Jnr to be bumped off because it was feared his relationship with the young Kim Novak would harm her marketability. Cohen supposedly relented and merely threatened Davis with the loss of his one good eye if he persisted. The strikes caused splits between writers and actors. Philip Dunne, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of How Green Was My Valley, claimed that Reagan 'postured all over the place' with his claims of picket line violence. Those who crossed the picket included Clark Gable, Esther Williams, Red Skelton, Greer Garson and Mickey Rooney. By contrast, in 1943 Jimmy Cagney, who was close to the Left, took over as leader of the Screen Actor's Guild. Other actors who were prominent in a movement to free a labour organiser, Tom Mooney, included Groucho Marx, Boris Karloff and Clifford Odets. During the strikes, imaginative tactics were employed. Strikers would try to damage box office returns by picketing cinemas and divulging film plots to queuing filmgoers. Pickets outside cinemas showing Lady on a Train told potential customers: 'Ralph Bellamy's the killer. And David Bruce gets the girl.' No one was in any doubt as to what the prize of control would be. A.P. Gianinni of the Bank of America, one of the industry's prime funders, observed prophetically: 'Those who control the cinema can control the thought of the world.' No wonder the strikes were bitterly fought. Photographs from the time show pickets trying to stop strike-breakers entering Warner Brothers in 1946. Disney workers dressed in Mickey Mouse masks picketed cinemas during their 1941 strike. Pickets massed outside Paramount Studios in 1945 and supporting students from UCLA joined them. A sheriff's car was torched outside MGM in 1946. 'One movie Hollywood has never produced and probably never will is the story of its own unionisation,' as one of the protagonists quoted by Horne put it. It would be quite a movie. \u0095 Class Struggle in Hollywood 1930-1950 : Moguls, Mobsters, Stars, Reds and Trade Unionists by Gerald Horne (University of Texas Press)",

The title of his latest movie, Bread and Roses, a film about a more-or-less successful industrial action involving the unionisation of office cleaners in Los Angeles, comes from the slogan of the striking workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts in 1912: 'We want bread - and roses, too.'

      "bodyText": "Bread and Roses (110 mins, 15) Directed by Ken Loach; starring Pilar Padilla, Elpidia Carrillo, Adrien Brody Ken Loach is a romantic socialist, in love with the movement's distant past, disgusted by its present, unhappy about its future. He recently resigned from the Labour Party, but while he probably had a sneaking regard for Michael Foot, it's doubtful whether he's been wholeheartedly in favour of any Labour leader since Keir Hardie. The title of his latest movie, Bread and Roses, a film about a more-or-less successful industrial action involving the unionisation of office cleaners in Los Angeles, comes from the slogan of the striking workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts in 1912: 'We want bread - and roses, too.' Ah, those were the days! That slogan is echoed in other Loach films - his TV quartet about the 1926 National Strike, Days of Hope, and his superb film set in the Spanish Civil War, Land and Freedom. Loach's career is one of the most singular in British cinema, 36 unremitting years as a left-wing moviemaker. He's thought of, and clearly thinks of himself, as an uncompromising artist working in a hostile environment and this is undoubtedly true. Nevertheless, he's managed to make 14 feature films as well as 22 movies and documentaries for television. Few of the theatrical works have found a large popular audience in the English-speaking world, and some of the TV films were rejected as too tendentious by the channels that commissioned them. But Loach, so far as one knows, has never had a film re-edited by a producer or distributor, though Kes, his one uncontested masterpiece, was subtitled in the States. Over the decades, he has also found congenial and like-minded collaborators to help him plough his lonely furrow. Writers Barry Hines, Jim Allen and Paul Laverty (author of Bread and Roses); cinematographers Chris Menges and Barry Ackroyd; designer Martin Johnson; editor Jonathan Morris; composer George Fenton; producers Tony Garnett, Sally Hibben, Rebecca O'Brien - all have worked with him on four films or more. Although set in the States, Bread and Roses is financed by five European countries and is in no sense a Hollywood movie. From as far back as Cathy Come Home, Loach has always tried to give his films an unmediated sense of life through the use of hand-held cameras, improvised dialogue and a deliberately rough, documentary look. From the start, when the film's heroine, Maya (Pilar Padilla), arrives in Los Angeles as an illegal immigrant from Mexico, there's a sense of the camera as a barely tolerated presence. The film begins with Hispanic crooks preventing a reunion between Maya and her elder sister, Rosa (Elpidia Carrillo), because Rosa hasn't raised the balance of the transportation fee. At the end, it comes full circle when Rosa runs after the US Immigration authority bus that is taking a central character to be dumped back over the border. In between those distressing scenes, Maya proves herself an energetic, energising force, first escaping from the clutches of the vile desperado who demands sex in place of the unpaid immigration bill. She then gets a job working with Rosa as a cleaner in a skyscraper that houses numerous top law firms and Hollywood agents, and immediately forms an alliance with a crafty young union organiser, Sam (Adrien Brody), who politicises her the way a similarly bearded left-wing Jewish intellectual does working-class factory girl Sally Field in Norma Rae. Their initial meeting is playful in a Chaplinesque mode as she helps him avoid the security guards who pursue him. Thereafter, their relationship is more serious as he stages a series of consciousness-raising meetings with her colleagues (mostly Latin American, though there's one very unco-operative Russian immigrant) and they conduct a guerrilla campaign to attract media attention and to undermine the morale of the skyscraper's proprietors. No one seeing this film could dispute the charge that the janitors are dreadfully exploited and are correct in demanding better conditions and pay and the right to organise. Not for the first time, however, Loach treats all middle-class people with contempt and holds up to ridicule those he regards as class-traitors who serve the capitalist establishment - foremen, the police, bureaucrats.

Church music still aspires to address the sky, but opera secularised the art and acquainted it with our profaner passions. The hybrid form that Andrew Lamb calls 'popular musical theatre', in which speech is intermittently sublimated and raised aloft by song, marks music's arrival on Earth.</p> <p>Cheered up by music, we can sing and dance through the rain, and believe, as the irrepressible orphan bellows in Annie, that: 'The sun will come out tomorrow.' The popularity of musicals, and their profitability, demonstrates our craving for a reassurance and an exhilaration that used to be dispensed by hymns and the ritualised chanting of the Mass. The mission persists: as a defrocked singing nun memorably put it: 'My heart will be blessed by the sound of music.' Or, if you're a non-denominational pantheist, you can choose to be whirled around in that cacophonous circle of life that is placed on view in the opening number of The Lion King. </p> <p>Musicals aren't necessarily spiritual and high-minded, however. They can be outrageously, infectiously, exhilaratingly bad for you, since music has no conscience. The hottest ticket in New York these days is for Mel Brooks's The Producers, a musical version of his film about a deranged Jewish impresario who mounts a Broadway show called Springtime for Hitler, with epicene chorus boys as goose-stepping gauleiters. He hopes (for his own farcical reasons) to lose money, but finds to his consternation that his gruesomely tasteless extravaganza is a hit. Our feet can't be stopped from tapping, even if they're accompanying the thunderous advance of a panzer division.</p> <p>Opera began as the preserve of emperors and generals, for whom Handel composed virtuoso tirades in Giulio Cesare or Tamerlano; Viennese operetta continued to confine itself to morganatic intrigues in tinpot Ruritanian monarchies. The musical, however, as Andrew Lamb argues in this racy history, was from the first a demotic form. </p> <p>Lamb might have proved his point more conclusively if he'd begun that history 250 years ago, not 150. The first musical is surely John Gay's The Beggar's Opera, which, ironically, cheapened grand opera by assigning lyrical sentiments to mendicants and criminals who don't believe in what they're singing. When Brecht and Weill set out to modernise and radicalise the musical in the early twentieth century, all they needed to do was to update Gay in The Threepenny Opera, which assaults the hypocrisy of capitalism and the puritan morality that sustained it.</p> <p>The musical's relations with opera have always been vexed. Reynaldo Hahn, Proust's lover, wrote a gooey operetta about Mozart's erotic dalliances in Paris; Andrew Lloyd Webber defers to Gounod's Faust in The Phantom of the Opera, quoting Margu\u00e9rite's mercenary aria about the jewel box.</p> <p>More often, as Lamb demonstrates, the citations are sarcastic. Barbieri's zarzuela El Barberillo de Lavapi\u00e9s replaces Rossini's Seville barber, who crimps the upper classes, with a chirpy colleague from the Madrid slums, and Lloyd Webber's preferred heroines are broken-down divas whose lives are not quite as operatic as they'd wish: Evita, or Norma Desmond from Sunset Boulevard. Lamb concludes, appropriately, with Jonathan Larson's Rent, in which Puccini's carefree bohemians mutate into HIV-positive wannabes living in the sulphurous East Village.</p> <p>The musical is sceptical about the art's astral origins, and has made a habit of debauching divinities. The Orpheus of Offenbach is a philanderer who can't wait to be rid of the termagant Eurydice. In Gilbert and Sullivan's Thespis, the debilitated gods, as in Wagner's G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung, resign from power. Weill's One Touch of Venus turns the goddess of love into a shopgirl, and in Damn Yankees Adler and Ross re-enact the Faust myth in the sweaty locker-room of a baseball team. </p> <p>Offenbach sent his Orpheus to the underworld; the composers of American musicals have been even bolder in probing the existence of the underclass. The gift of song, for these musicians, belongs not to a classical god, but to oppressed blacks who vent their grief and rage in music. Hence the bass's stoical meditation on 'Ol' Man River' in Showboat - given an extra edge of vindictive menace when Paul Robeson, a communist sympathiser, sang it - or the choruses, alternately uproarious or elegiac, of the ghetto-dwellers in Porgy and Bess. </p> <p>We think of the musical as a form synonymous with glamour but it has an even greater fascination with squalor: Guys and Dolls contains an illicit crap game, and Pal Joey is set in a sleazy clip joint. Even My Fair Lady begins in the murk of the Covent Garden market, with Eliza among the downtrodden blooms. Inevitably, she is lifted out of the gutter: her experience reverses the desanctifying of the goddess that occurs in La Belle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne or One Touch of Venus.</p> <p>Although music may have bumped down to earth, it can never forget its loftier home. While Shaw's Henry Higgins in Pygmalion can only teach elocution to his cockney pupil, Lerner and Loewe's Eliza teaches the throttled, repressive Higgins to sing, which is more of an achievement.

      "body": "<p>Muriel Gray made her name being opinionated, rude, passionately enthusiastic and outraged; a post-punk presenter on programmes such as The Tube and The Media Show, with an inquisitive face and a mouthful of insults. Her bleached hair bristled; her bright-painted mouth grimaced; her brow furrowed. Everything about her seemed mobile and hungry and cross. Even her Scottish accent seemed bracingly unemollient. But today, as she sits opposite me in her office in Glasgow eating a doorstopper of a poached-egg sandwich and drinking coffee, her thin face is tired and bare under her whitened crop of hair. </p> <p>She's in her forties now: businesswoman, occasional presenter, dogged writer of startling horror novels, wife, mother of three children, a skinny woman run off her plimsolled feet, trying to be in two places at once, anxious somewhere at the back of her brain, exhausted but putting a smile on it.</p> <p>I am here today to meet her as horror writer - her third novel, The Ancient, is published tomorrow, a scary and grotesque tale of a cargo ship which is like a floating house of horrors, carrying as it does a crew of sailors with their own secret demons and a monster that surges out of the fetid darkness of the ship's holds. </p> <p>Gray's father was a merchant seaman, but she got the idea one day when she was driving past a rubbish van and saw that the men had made a figure out of garbage that was sitting on the front seat. 'It was disgusting,' she says with relish. I tell her her book was disgusting too - full of ripped flesh and nameless terrors made from our most inadmissible fears. 'Well, I hope it's disgusting, I tried to make it disgusting. But was it scary enough?' </p> <p>Yes, I assure her; quite enough - and it is also well-written and grim, much grimmer than her previous novels, which allowed glimpses of human contentment. 'It's true, it is the bleakest one. I hadn't really thought of that. I know it's usually a male thing - but I've loved horror since I was nine or 10. I've always read voraciously and still do - but when I go on holiday, I have to pack the Stephen King and the Pan Book of Horror Stories under the Jane Austen. I prefer the horror that isn't just gothic - the stuff that's grounded in everyday life. People in bedsits with their Baby Bellings. There's nothing more frightening than your safe haven being threatened by something dark.' </p> <p>Stephen King is her hero - and he has unexpectedly given her a quotation for the cover of The Ancient. He requested the manuscript out of the blue, and emailed her the 'nicest comment. It is the highlight of my professional life,' she exclaims. </p> <p>She thinks she sees life in terms of horror. 'The other day my husband Hamish was talking about these webcams that people are installing in their second homes, so at any time you can just click on it and see how your nice second home in Tuscany might be getting on - and I just thought about clicking on it and seeing this seventeenth-century family in the sitting room. Or I listen to the baby alarm and expect to hear something else, something spooky, in the background.' Of course, she says: 'I don't believe any of the supernatural things. I wish it was like that - there'd be nothing more romantic. It presupposes a plan, reasons for things. Good and evil, black and white, hidden secrets and delights. It's escapism really. Comforting.'</p> <p>Gray thinks of herself as a writer now, more than a presenter, or someone who runs Ideal World - which she started 10 years ago and which is now the biggest TV production company in Scotland. 'It's not me who's made it work, though. It was just a daft, pissy little thing when I was running it. Then I got this fantastic partner, Zad Rogers. And when I got pregnant, Zad and I begged and pleaded for Hamish [her husband] to join us. I took a back seat. It's all down to them. It only grew so large and successful when I stopped coming into the office and wandering around shouting and eating egg rolls.' She sinks her teeth into her sandwich and the yolk runs down her chin.</p> <p>For a long time, she says, she thought she had stopped being so angry. 'I didn't have the heart for it any more.' When she was younger, she admits to having been confrontational 'just to see what happened. You know, the equivalent to pushing against someone in a nightclub. I was always a fight-starter, particularly in print. It was fun, kind of - I do like fights. 'I've never been like Julie Burchill, doing it for the sake of hearing her own voice. I always got furious about things I cared passionately about. There are things that make me flamingly angry, and I don't stay calm. I shoot my mouth off. But I thought I was getting better; a bit older and wiser. There didn't seem much room anymore for catatonic fury over something I happened to read in Hello!' She chuckles, thinking perhaps of her most recent outbursts about fox-hunting or Catholicism. </p> <p>There's another kind of anger as well - one which she is less in control of and more wary of. It's like a red mist that comes over her. She will be in a supermarket or just walking along a street and she'll see someone behaving badly or abusively, and she'll pick a fight. It's like life-rage. 'Any normal person would just walk away,' she says. 'But it is as if I am wanting something to escalate. It's as if I want to be fought with, to be attacked back. I'm saying, \"Hit me, hit me!\" It comes out of the blue, this feeling. I don't care about the consequences, but feel completely hot and reckless and dangerous. It's not a mystery, of course. I have had this terrible internal pain for such a long time, so I suppose I feel the desire to have it matched by a physical pain. \"Please smash me in the face\" - well, there'd be a queue down the street to do that. I'd have to issue tickets.' </p> <p>She laughs again, a hoot of merriment - she has this tremendous ability to be funny and caustically cheerful and scornfully upbeat, and yet completely sorrowful, all at the same complicated time. </p> <p>The sorrow comes because of an accident that happened four years ago, and which turned her happy, well-run, successful world on its head and changed her life forever. Her second child, a two-year-old daughter called Rowan whose photograph she shows me, with her sweet pale face and soft brown hair and her mother's bluest eyes, went out one morning with the nanny. They were visiting the next-door-neighbour while Muriel worked on her book. Rowan fell into the neighbour's pond and was found face down in the water, unconscious. She nearly died, and has been severely brain damaged ever since. Gray doesn't know if Rowan even recognises her parents or siblings (two years ago they had a third child, Angus, to be a companion for eight-year-old Hector). She doesn't know what goes on in her 'darling, darling head'.</p> <p>Gray has been quoted as saying that she didn't blame the nanny because it was her fault for having one. It's true that she was always puritanically anxious about having a nanny - she can't understand women who simply hand over their children to a carer and don't see them for 12 hours a day. But she says that 'fault' and 'guilt' are the wrong words; they sound 'ludicrous'. It's more, she says, turning her bony face toward me, 'that I'm a mother. How could I not have saved her? Why couldn't I have prevented that grief, that terror? It's a parent's most basic job, and I failed it. I didn't keep her safe. My darling wee girl.' There's no comfort for that sense of loss - you don't get over it. Time doesn't heal.</p> <p>Since that time, Gray has coped by somehow taking all the burdens on herself (this is not how she would put it). She won't ever have a nanny again, though she has had a helper. She takes responsibility for her three children, ferrying them to school and collecting them (Rowan goes to a special school 20 miles away), shopping, cooking, caring, being a full-time mother and fitting her work round the corners of her day. Writing often starts at 10 at night, when the children are asleep. She rarely leaves them for a few hours, let alone a night or a week. And she copes by not thinking too far ahead. And by being cheerful, hour by hour. </p> <p>'Denial is essential. Otherwise you'd go mad. Look at people in other countries, where all their children are dying of Aids. They still cope and look after their families and keep on working and living, and it's not because they're different, less sensitive, not at all. It's because they've developed this heightened ability to contain their pain. You have to contain pain, otherwise you come apart at the seams.'</p> <p>She is heartened and 'interested', nowadays, by the fact that she still feels professionally driven. 'I gave up doing programmes when I got pregnant with Hector - I didn't want to have a baby and then just dump him. What a waste of having children. And I've been a housewife full-time for four years. I've turned down almost everything because I can't leave home. I've never had the ambition to get ahead - what does that mean: \"get ahead\"? Fame for fame's sake, I don't understand that at all; it disgusts me. But I feel the urge to create things, to make things. Looking after children is not rocket-science, and it can be terribly frustrating.' </p> <p>For a while, she felt finished. 'But now I feel I'm not finished yet, I have lots more to say.' She doesn't worry about getting older - 'except one day I won't be able to lift Rowan any more. I was never beautiful when I was young anyway; it's not like Claudia Schiffer getting older. I think I've got the Andy Warhol syndrome anyway; I was always old.' </p> <p>She doesn't believe in the hierarchy of suffering - 'the I'm-sadder-than-you-are culture' - and she knows that she is 'very lucky really. I have fantastic things in my life. All my children are gorgeous. Hamish is gorgeous; poor love, we hardly even go out for dinner together now. The tarpaulin over our life flaps as if we were in a gale force 10 , but we manage to peg it down and it's OK, we're OK - whereas some people have tarpaulins that fit perfectly tightly and neatly and still they are miserable.' </p> <p>But, she says: 'I am terribly tired. I have the ability to burn brightly when required. It's like lighting a flare. Then I fizzle out.' </p> <p>She doesn't, she says quite cheerfully, have much time for the concept of 'happiness. Maybe happiness is more a state of contentment, with peaks and troughs. One of the phrases that for me sums up what I mean by happiness - this sounds hopelessly old-fashioned - is 'the successful fulfilment of duty\". Not self-gratification, and that \"listen to me, I'm so special\" thing. No, happiness because you've fulfilled your duty to your husband, your children, your friends, your family.' </p> <p>What makes this austere statement poignant, of course, is that Gray feels she has not fulfilled her duty towards her daughter; so she is forever an exile from happiness. Nothing she does now can ever be enough. </p> <p>She doesn't like religions (in fact, the day I meet her, she has just penned a vitriolic attack on Catholicism for the Guardian, and blithely talks to me of rosaries being shoved up arses). She is disturbed by 'the dark clouds of religious fervour that are closing in again', and doesn't believe in God. She grew up an agnostic and for four years has been more of an atheist, there being no room for God in a world in which her daughter lost so much. But she has no fear of death, not any more.</p> <p>'I used to, of course. I used to dread dying. In that way I've changed hugely. I only worry about getting stuff sorted out beforehand; it's life that worries me. Sometimes I look forward to dying. Not \"hooray\" - but at least there's an end to it. It's nice to think that life is finite. People won't always suffer.'</p> <p>So the agony hasn't abated? She smiles and pokes around in the unappetising beige remains of her poached-egg sandwich. 'No. How can it?'</p> <p>\u0095 The Ancient is published next month by HarperCollins. To order a copy in advance at a special price, call Observer CultureShop on 0800 3168 171</p>",

      "bodyText": "Muriel Gray made her name being opinionated, rude, passionately enthusiastic and outraged; a post-punk presenter on programmes such as The Tube and The Media Show, with an inquisitive face and a mouthful of insults. Her bleached hair bristled; her bright-painted mouth grimaced; her brow furrowed. Everything about her seemed mobile and hungry and cross. Even her Scottish accent seemed bracingly unemollient. But today, as she sits opposite me in her office in Glasgow eating a doorstopper of a poached-egg sandwich and drinking coffee, her thin face is tired and bare under her whitened crop of hair. She's in her forties now: businesswoman, occasional presenter, dogged writer of startling horror novels, wife, mother of three children, a skinny woman run off her plimsolled feet, trying to be in two places at once, anxious somewhere at the back of her brain, exhausted but putting a smile on it. I am here today to meet her as horror writer - her third novel, The Ancient, is published tomorrow, a scary and grotesque tale of a cargo ship which is like a floating house of horrors, carrying as it does a crew of sailors with their own secret demons and a monster that surges out of the fetid darkness of the ship's holds. Gray's father was a merchant seaman, but she got the idea one day when she was driving past a rubbish van and saw that the men had made a figure out of garbage that was sitting on the front seat. 'It was disgusting,' she says with relish. I tell her her book was disgusting too - full of ripped flesh and nameless terrors made from our most inadmissible fears. 'Well, I hope it's disgusting, I tried to make it disgusting. But was it scary enough?' Yes, I assure her; quite enough - and it is also well-written and grim, much grimmer than her previous novels, which allowed glimpses of human contentment. 'It's true, it is the bleakest one. I hadn't really thought of that. I know it's usually a male thing - but I've loved horror since I was nine or 10. I've always read voraciously and still do - but when I go on holiday, I have to pack the Stephen King and the Pan Book of Horror Stories under the Jane Austen. I prefer the horror that isn't just gothic - the stuff that's grounded in everyday life. People in bedsits with their Baby Bellings. There's nothing more frightening than your safe haven being threatened by something dark.' Stephen King is her hero - and he has unexpectedly given her a quotation for the cover of The Ancient. He requested the manuscript out of the blue, and emailed her the 'nicest comment. It is the highlight of my professional life,' she exclaims. She thinks she sees life in terms of horror. 'The other day my husband Hamish was talking about these webcams that people are installing in their second homes, so at any time you can just click on it and see how your nice second home in Tuscany might be getting on - and I just thought about clicking on it and seeing this seventeenth-century family in the sitting room. Or I listen to the baby alarm and expect to hear something else, something spooky, in the background.' Of course, she says: 'I don't believe any of the supernatural things. I wish it was like that - there'd be nothing more romantic. It presupposes a plan, reasons for things. Good and evil, black and white, hidden secrets and delights. It's escapism really. Comforting.' Gray thinks of herself as a writer now, more than a presenter, or someone who runs Ideal World - which she started 10 years ago and which is now the biggest TV production company in Scotland. 'It's not me who's made it work, though. It was just a daft, pissy little thing when I was running it. Then I got this fantastic partner, Zad Rogers. And when I got pregnant, Zad and I begged and pleaded for Hamish [her husband] to join us. I took a back seat. It's all down to them. It only grew so large and successful when I stopped coming into the office and wandering around shouting and eating egg rolls.' She sinks her teeth into her sandwich and the yolk runs down her chin. For a long time, she says, she thought she had stopped being so angry. 'I didn't have the heart for it any more.' When she was younger, she admits to having been confrontational 'just to see what happened. You know, the equivalent to pushing against someone in a nightclub. I was always a fight-starter, particularly in print. It was fun, kind of - I do like fights. 'I've never been like Julie Burchill, doing it for the sake of hearing her own voice. I always got furious about things I cared passionately about. There are things that make me flamingly angry, and I don't stay calm. I shoot my mouth off. But I thought I was getting better; a bit older and wiser. There didn't seem much room anymore for catatonic fury over something I happened to read in Hello!' She chuckles, thinking perhaps of her most recent outbursts about fox-hunting or Catholicism. There's another kind of anger as well - one which she is less in control of and more wary of. It's like a red mist that comes over her. She will be in a supermarket or just walking along a street and she'll see someone behaving badly or abusively, and she'll pick a fight. It's like life-rage. 'Any normal person would just walk away,' she says. 'But it is as if I am wanting something to escalate. It's as if I want to be fought with, to be attacked back. I'm saying, \"Hit me, hit me!\" It comes out of the blue, this feeling. I don't care about the consequences, but feel completely hot and reckless and dangerous. It's not a mystery, of course. I have had this terrible internal pain for such a long time, so I suppose I feel the desire to have it matched by a physical pain. \"Please smash me in the face\" - well, there'd be a queue down the street to do that. I'd have to issue tickets.' She laughs again, a hoot of merriment - she has this tremendous ability to be funny and caustically cheerful and scornfully upbeat, and yet completely sorrowful, all at the same complicated time. The sorrow comes because of an accident that happened four years ago, and which turned her happy, well-run, successful world on its head and changed her life forever.

      "body": "<p><strong>Observer:</strong> What is Hotel Honolulu about?</p> <p><strong>Theroux:</strong> I see it as a book about a place which is very difficult to write about. There are two places that are hard to write about. A place like Britain, England in particular, which has been written about by everybody, and then the place that's never been written about. I've tried to find a form that would accommodate the place that I've been living in for 11 years.</p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> Is it the first attempt to make a literature of Hawaii?</p> <p><strong>Theroux:</strong> I don't know of any other book. There are books about Hawaii, such as James A. Michener's Tales of the South Pacific. Robert Louis Stevenson didn't like it. He thought it was silly, full of missionaries and uncomfortable. He didn't like the weather and then he took off to Samoa.</p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> And the book's also about you, of course.</p> <p><strong>Theroux:</strong> Let's say a version of me. I wanted to write about a writer who had stopped writing, a person with writer's block. It's something that interests me a lot because - knock on wood - I've never had it. It's about a man who is suffering through this period of 10 years of not writing anything, whereas in the last 10 years I've actually written 10 books. </p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> You seem to be wanting to say in your work generally, but in this book more than ever before, that all fiction is in some way autobiography and that all autobiography is fiction.</p> <p><strong>Theroux:</strong> Well, I think that's true. Everything is fiction. You only have your own life to work with in the way that a biographer only has the letters and journals to work with.</p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> What's fiction for?</p> <p><strong>Theroux:</strong> For telling the truth. And I think it's a version of the truth which is made up of... </p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> Lies?</p> <p><strong>Theroux:</strong> Speculations more than lies, but it really is the most truthful thing at its best. That's why people still read it and why we still need it. </p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> The narrator says: 'I used to be a writer.' There's a lot of self-criticism, almost self-loathing in the book. Is this your Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold?</p> <p><strong>Theroux:</strong> There is a Gilbert Pinfoldish story here. It's not self-loathing; I think it's like exorcising a fear, a fear of not being able to write. It's also taking the curse off the evil eye. One of my fears is not writing. I don't know how to do anything else.</p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> Did you always want to be a writer?</p> <p><strong>Theroux:</strong> No. What I really wanted to be was a 'useful person'. I wanted to be a doctor; I even did pre-medical.</p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> How did you switch?</p> <p><strong>Theroux:</strong> I was actually on my way to medical school. That's what I was reading at university - science, embryology and chemistry.</p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> When you were growing up, who else did you read?</p> <p><strong>Theroux:</strong> Travellers and people who had two strings on their bows. The writer-doctor, the explorer-doctor, the explorer-writer, the painter-writer. </p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> Like who?</p> <p><strong>Theroux:</strong> Well Chekhov, Somerset Maugham, Greene and Edward Lear. I loved Lear and still do. In the end, partly because of Vietnam, I thought I want to just leave the country and hide and not be in the army, so I went to Africa.</p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> You were in Africa, then London and now you're in Hawaii. Are you a natural expatriate?</p> <p><strong>Theroux:</strong> I'm not as much an expatriate as you might think. When I began to make some money, I really wanted to have a home.</p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> Which you had here, surely?</p> <p><strong>Theroux:</strong> Yes, but I felt like an alien. I felt like someone off a rocket ship, like ET, anyway. So when I made some money in the mid-Seventies I bought a house in Cape Cod, near where I grew up. I always considered that home. Yes, I was an expatriate but I could pop on a plane and go home. It's not like being Rimbaud in Ethiopia who had given up writing. Rimbaud abandoned everything. I was never in that position. </p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> But the 'I' in this book, the Paul Theroux figure in this book, actually makes a point of saying he's abandoned everything.</p> <p><strong>Theroux:</strong> All his bridges are burnt. </p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> You like to self-dramatise, don't you? Why is that?</p> <p><strong>Theroux:</strong> That's how I feel sometimes. </p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> How did you feel when you first went to Hawaii ?</p> <p><strong>Theroux:</strong> I was really out on a limb. If you look at a map you see that Hawaii is in the middle of nowhere. It's 17 hours of straight flying from London. It's very far away and sometimes you feel as if you're on another planet. But I like that. Also, that's ideal for writing.</p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> You write: 'One of my first pleasures in Hawaii was that my past did not matter.'</p> <p><strong>Theroux:</strong> Yes. You're just a white guy, a 'howlie'. Howlie technically means 'of another breath'.You're just a ghost, a wraith. In most societies, a stranger is just a ghost. I like that. </p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> But you're also a very literary person. You're steeped in literature, you're very well read and I remember you in London being deeply involved in the literary world. Don't you miss that?</p> <p><strong>Theroux:</strong> No, I really don't. When I was living in London, I had a very happy home and I was living in the bosom of my family. I liked that much more than being a member of literary society. I knew, and still know, most of the writers in London and literary London is a very friendly place in the sense that people know each other very well. I wrote a piece about Bruce Chatwin's funeral. </p> <p>At Bruce's funeral, everyone came together; everyone knew Bruce and everyone knew each other. His funeral was the high watermark of that decade's creative activity. It was also the day that Salman Rushdie got the fatwa. After that, I felt: 'Well, this is it, time to go.' </p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> Your marriage broke up or was breaking up?</p> <p><strong>Theroux:</strong> Well, yes. It didn't so much break up as... this is a very difficult thing to talk about, but I was kind of leaving. I think the problem wasn't my wife at all - it was me. I felt very restless in 1989 and I felt superfluous. I had these years of feeling the superfluous man, like Oblomov. I had one of those periods of questioning what I was doing and wondering about life. </p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> So you went to Hawaii?</p> <p><strong>Theroux:</strong> When my wife and I split up, I went to the Pacific. I spent months and months travelling around islands. I recorded that in The Happy Isles of Oceania. It wasn't the total answer but it helped. If you have something on your mind, it really helps to be alone and be among total strangers in a completely alien environment. In the global village, it's not that easy because people have cellphones.</p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> Do you have a cellphone?</p> <p><strong>Theroux:</strong> No, I don't. I draw the line there. I think that would be death for me. I don't think I've ever seen a person having a serious conversation on a cellphone. It's like a kiddie thing, a complete time waster. </p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> Do you have email?</p> <p><strong>Theroux:</strong> Not when I'm travelling, but in normal life I do.</p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> There's a lot of sex in Hotel Honolulu.</p> <p><strong>Theroux:</strong> I've been told there's a lot of sex in everything I write.</p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> There's a great deal in this novel - of all kinds. I wondered whether you're reflecting something about Hawaii or whether it reflects something about you. </p> <p><strong>Theroux:</strong> There's maybe more sex than usual because hotels are just bedrooms. It's also true in a place like Honolulu with so many visitors. I think it's true to the place, true to the hotel and true to Honolulu.</p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> Is the hotel a real hotel?</p> <p><strong>Theroux:</strong> No, pure invention. By some stroke of fortune, no one's ever called a hotel Hotel Honolulu. </p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> There's a bit at the end here: 'The only place that can truly be hell is the one that was once paradise.' Is this what you're saying about Hawaii?</p> <p><strong>Theroux:</strong> Yes, because it's an Eden that's been invaded by traffic and mobile phones.</p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> So, you've gone all the way across the world and you're in hell?</p> <p><strong>Theroux:</strong> Not hell, but a place that's been disfigured by people and the people who have gone there. </p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> What will the Hawaiians say about your book?</p> <p><strong>Theroux:</strong> They probably won't like it. People who don't read books a lot are threatened by books. If it was reviewed in Hawaii, it would be universally panned. The idea of being written about is threatening. There are certain recognisable people in it, but most of them are dead.</p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> And, of course, you've got Leon Edel [the biographer of Henry James] in the story. It must have been a great relief for you to find him there.</p> <p><strong>Theroux:</strong> Amazing. I used him in the book. It wasn't quite like that. The way I wrote about it was as though we were two aliens from a different planet. Meeting him was wonderful. </p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> So the Edel story is a fictionalised version of the truth. That wasn't true of Sir Vidia's Shadow, though, was it?</p> <p><strong>Theroux:</strong> Sir Vidia's Shadow is everything that I could remember about my friendship [with V.S . Naipaul] and knowing him. This was a master-servant relationship. People who know Naipaul tend to be very nervous around him, saying the wrong thing, serving the wrong wine, or just saying the wrong thing about his books. When he finally left Andr\u00e9 Deutsch, Diane Athill said: 'I was delighted when he left; it was such a sense of relief, I almost wept with joy. I never had to be nice to him again.'

      "bodyText": "Observer: What is Hotel Honolulu about? Theroux: I see it as a book about a place which is very difficult to write about. There are two places that are hard to write about. A place like Britain, England in particular, which has been written about by everybody, and then the place that's never been written about. I've tried to find a form that would accommodate the place that I've been living in for 11 years. Obs: Is it the first attempt to make a literature of Hawaii? Theroux: I don't know of any other book. There are books about Hawaii, such as James A. Michener's Tales of the South Pacific. Robert Louis Stevenson didn't like it. He thought it was silly, full of missionaries and uncomfortable. He didn't like the weather and then he took off to Samoa. Obs: And the book's also about you, of course. Theroux: Let's say a version of me. I wanted to write about a writer who had stopped writing, a person with writer's block. It's something that interests me a lot because - knock on wood - I've never had it. It's about a man who is suffering through this period of 10 years of not writing anything, whereas in the last 10 years I've actually written 10 books. Obs: You seem to be wanting to say in your work generally, but in this book more than ever before, that all fiction is in some way autobiography and that all autobiography is fiction. Theroux: Well, I think that's true. Everything is fiction. You only have your own life to work with in the way that a biographer only has the letters and journals to work with. Obs: What's fiction for? Theroux: For telling the truth. And I think it's a version of the truth which is made up of... Obs: Lies? Theroux: Speculations more than lies, but it really is the most truthful thing at its best. That's why people still read it and why we still need it. Obs: The narrator says: 'I used to be a writer.' There's a lot of self-criticism, almost self-loathing in the book. Is this your Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold? Theroux: There is a Gilbert Pinfoldish story here. It's not self-loathing; I think it's like exorcising a fear, a fear of not being able to write. It's also taking the curse off the evil eye. One of my fears is not writing. I don't know how to do anything else. Obs: Did you always want to be a writer? Theroux: No. What I really wanted to be was a 'useful person'. I wanted to be a doctor; I even did pre-medical. Obs: How did you switch? Theroux: I was actually on my way to medical school. That's what I was reading at university - science, embryology and chemistry. Obs: When you were growing up, who else did you read? Theroux: Travellers and people who had two strings on their bows. The writer-doctor, the explorer-doctor, the explorer-writer, the painter-writer. Obs: Like who? Theroux: Well Chekhov, Somerset Maugham, Greene and Edward Lear. I loved Lear and still do. In the end, partly because of Vietnam, I thought I want to just leave the country and hide and not be in the army, so I went to Africa. Obs: You were in Africa, then London and now you're in Hawaii. Are you a natural expatriate? Theroux: I'm not as much an expatriate as you might think. When I began to make some money, I really wanted to have a home. Obs: Which you had here, surely? Theroux: Yes, but I felt like an alien. I felt like someone off a rocket ship, like ET, anyway. So when I made some money in the mid-Seventies I bought a house in Cape Cod, near where I grew up. I always considered that home. Yes, I was an expatriate but I could pop on a plane and go home. It's not like being Rimbaud in Ethiopia who had given up writing. Rimbaud abandoned everything. I was never in that position. Obs: But the 'I' in this book, the Paul Theroux figure in this book, actually makes a point of saying he's abandoned everything. Theroux: All his bridges are burnt. Obs: You like to self-dramatise, don't you? Why is that? Theroux: That's how I feel sometimes. Obs: How did you feel when you first went to Hawaii ? Theroux: I was really out on a limb. If you look at a map you see that Hawaii is in the middle of nowhere. It's 17 hours of straight flying from London. It's very far away and sometimes you feel as if you're on another planet. But I like that. Also, that's ideal for writing. Obs: You write: 'One of my first pleasures in Hawaii was that my past did not matter.' Theroux: Yes. You're just a white guy, a 'howlie'. Howlie technically means 'of another breath'.You're just a ghost, a wraith. In most societies, a stranger is just a ghost. I like that. Obs: But you're also a very literary person. You're steeped in literature, you're very well read and I remember you in London being deeply involved in the literary world. Don't you miss that? Theroux: No, I really don't. When I was living in London, I had a very happy home and I was living in the bosom of my family. I liked that much more than being a member of literary society. I knew, and still know, most of the writers in London and literary London is a very friendly place in the sense that people know each other very well. I wrote a piece about Bruce Chatwin's funeral. At Bruce's funeral, everyone came together; everyone knew Bruce and everyone knew each other. His funeral was the high watermark of that decade's creative activity. It was also the day that Salman Rushdie got the fatwa. After that, I felt: 'Well, this is it, time to go.' Obs: Your marriage broke up or was breaking up? Theroux: Well, yes. It didn't so much break up as... this is a very difficult thing to talk about, but I was kind of leaving. I think the problem wasn't my wife at all - it was me. I felt very restless in 1989 and I felt superfluous. I had these years of feeling the superfluous man, like Oblomov. I had one of those periods of questioning what I was doing and wondering about life. Obs: So you went to Hawaii? Theroux: When my wife and I split up, I went to the Pacific. I spent months and months travelling around islands. I recorded that in The Happy Isles of Oceania. It wasn't the total answer but it helped. If you have something on your mind, it really helps to be alone and be among total strangers in a completely alien environment. In the global village, it's not that easy because people have cellphones. Obs: Do you have a cellphone? Theroux: No, I don't. I draw the line there. I think that would be death for me. I don't think I've ever seen a person having a serious conversation on a cellphone. It's like a kiddie thing, a complete time waster. Obs: Do you have email? Theroux: Not when I'm travelling, but in normal life I do. Obs: There's a lot of sex in Hotel Honolulu. Theroux: I've been told there's a lot of sex in everything I write. Obs: There's a great deal in this novel - of all kinds. I wondered whether you're reflecting something about Hawaii or whether it reflects something about you. Theroux: There's maybe more sex than usual because hotels are just bedrooms. It's also true in a place like Honolulu with so many visitors. I think it's true to the place, true to the hotel and true to Honolulu. Obs: Is the hotel a real hotel? Theroux: No, pure invention. By some stroke of fortune, no one's ever called a hotel Hotel Honolulu. Obs: There's a bit at the end here: 'The only place that can truly be hell is the one that was once paradise.' Is this what you're saying about Hawaii? Theroux: Yes, because it's an Eden that's been invaded by traffic and mobile phones. Obs: So, you've gone all the way across the world and you're in hell? Theroux: Not hell, but a place that's been disfigured by people and the people who have gone there. Obs: What will the Hawaiians say about your book? Theroux: They probably won't like it. People who don't read books a lot are threatened by books. If it was reviewed in Hawaii, it would be universally panned. The idea of being written about is threatening. There are certain recognisable people in it, but most of them are dead. Obs: And, of course, you've got Leon Edel [the biographer of Henry James] in the story. It must have been a great relief for you to find him there. Theroux: Amazing. I used him in the book. It wasn't quite like that. The way I wrote about it was as though we were two aliens from a different planet. Meeting him was wonderful. Obs: So the Edel story is a fictionalised version of the truth. That wasn't true of Sir Vidia's Shadow, though, was it? Theroux: Sir Vidia's Shadow is everything that I could remember about my friendship [with V.S . Naipaul] and knowing him. This was a master-servant relationship. People who know Naipaul tend to be very nervous around him, saying the wrong thing, serving the wrong wine, or just saying the wrong thing about his books. When he finally left Andr\u00e9 Deutsch, Diane Athill said: 'I was delighted when he left; it was such a sense of relief, I almost wept with joy. I never had to be nice to him again.' So it's a sense of relief. It's like selling your yacht. Obs: But that book is not just about relief. Theroux: You can't write about a friend, you can only write about a former friend. I thought I can write the book that I'd been narrating in my head all this time To me, it's one of the best books I've written. I think it's a very satisfying book because in my life - this is the reason I can't write biography - is I take too many liberties, but there are no liberties in the book. Obs: You painted yourself in a pretty unflattering light. Theroux: Well, unsparing. I tried very hard because I couldn't do it to him and not to myself. Probably the book's about me and not him. There was a kind of spurious furore about it but it will settle down. The great thing about a book is that it goes it's own way. Hype helps maybe for a month or so but in the end if a book is good, the book will look after itself and that's definitely true. That's a Naipaul lesson, actually. And that's why it's the fairest profession, because if you write something well, it will be printed. If it's good, it will be absolutely deathless. Obs: Stevenson's words are as fresh now as when they were written. They still speak to us across time and distance. Theroux: He's completely original. Obs: Are you following in his footsteps? Theroux: I don't see the footsteps. He died young; he wasn't there a long time and he's a true genius. You can see there's genius in his writing. I don't think there's genius in my writing. Talent maybe, not genius. \u0095 Paul Theroux's books include The Great Railway Bazaar, The Family Arsenal and The Mosquito Coast. His new novel is set in Hawaii, where he now lives",

But his latest novel, The Day We Had Hitler Home, jerks the reader to attention by depositing Hitler into the plot, only to recede into opaque twists and obscuring quirkiness.</p> <p>Hitler arrives, implausibly, in a small Australian town shortly after the First World War and is invited home, even more implausibly, by an Australian family - Audrey McNeil, her irascible sister, Sibyl, and Sibyl's lascivious, roaming-eyed husband, Immanuel. </p> <p>Audrey inhabits a perfumed terrain of post-adolescent self-absorption, preoccupied with her recently acquired camera and her speculations about whether Immanuel is about to seduce her. The arrival of Hitler supplies her with new matter and she is soon discovered musing with perturbed fascination on his 'clammy skin' with its 'stippling of pores, some grossly open and peppered with blackheads, others tiny pits sprouting aggressive hairs'. </p> <p>Hitler, meanwhile, behaves as if he is Charlie Chaplin just dropped in from The Great Dictator: he stuffs himself with cream cakes, falls over, grunts and sneers and is highly sensitive about his moustache. Audrey's fascination for the 'radiant cold energy' of this 'fabulous creature, a European' continues unabated until, that is, Hitler asks her if she has 'ever thought about... how stimulating shit can be?' and grabs her breasts. </p> <p>Hitler's significance seems primarily as a catalyst for change in Audrey's life, as a sort of hyper-racist, megalomaniac guru of self-realisation. After Hitler has been handed over to the Germans, Audrey decides to pursue her 'passion for modernity' and Europeans in particular, and moves to Munich, clutching a small notebook of jottings in German which she believes Hitler left behind.</p> <p>She enters a carnivalesque Europe of Isherwoodian cinema-drones and amorality and makes the outsider's mistake of falling in with the stiffs - bankers, pragmatists and the ancient pterodactyls sipping tea and jangling their bracelets. She attends rants being given by the new sensation, Adolf Hitler, and eventually finds her way to the headquarters of the National Socialist party. In a scene of gruesome anticlimax, she presents Hitler with what she thinks is his notebook and then appears to have nothing else to say, except to pose her own underwhelming 'overwhelming question': 'I have come... to ask if women frighten you.' </p> <p>The Hitler plot appears to be over and the reader is excitedly awaiting an explanation of quite what has been going on, when Audrey undergoes a change of ideology, courtesy of Bello, an African actor, sweaty and sensuous, a man of dark moods, dark passions, a lover and a victim. As a result of Bello, Audrey comes to 'harbour doubts about Nazism' and, after Bello is lynched, is forced to flee Germany. She returns with her 'collection of images' to Australia, where her sister and brother-in-law have just died, true to the Futurist manifesto, in a plane crash.</p> <p>At one point, Audrey finds that, 'suddenly I am at the still centre'. This comes as little surprise to the reader. The driving force of the narrative is the developing character of Audrey; all other personalities, historical figures and artistic movements are subjected to the relentless permutations of self-analysis. Family secrets intertwine with the darkest hours of history; personal traumas are relayed in insistent breathiness, drowning out the shrillness of Nazism. The final twist of the knife, in which Audrey realises that her hold on Hitler was mere fantasy, seems to tip back the scales, return the small people to anonymity; Audrey duly goes home - and the great go to history. </p> <p>It also gives the lie to all Audrey's scene-stealing, but if Audrey was a fantasist after all, then The Day We Had Hitler Home seems little more than a spluttering literary What if?, opening with sensation and ending in irresolution.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Day We Had Hitler Home Rodney Hall Granta \u00a315.99, pp351 Buy it at a discount at BOL Rodney Hall is an Australian writer with indisputably fine credentials who has twice won the antipodean equivalent of the Booker. But his latest novel, The Day We Had Hitler Home, jerks the reader to attention by depositing Hitler into the plot, only to recede into opaque twists and obscuring quirkiness. Hitler arrives, implausibly, in a small Australian town shortly after the First World War and is invited home, even more implausibly, by an Australian family - Audrey McNeil, her irascible sister, Sibyl, and Sibyl's lascivious, roaming-eyed husband, Immanuel. Audrey inhabits a perfumed terrain of post-adolescent self-absorption, preoccupied with her recently acquired camera and her speculations about whether Immanuel is about to seduce her. The arrival of Hitler supplies her with new matter and she is soon discovered musing with perturbed fascination on his 'clammy skin' with its 'stippling of pores, some grossly open and peppered with blackheads, others tiny pits sprouting aggressive hairs'. Hitler, meanwhile, behaves as if he is Charlie Chaplin just dropped in from The Great Dictator: he stuffs himself with cream cakes, falls over, grunts and sneers and is highly sensitive about his moustache. Audrey's fascination for the 'radiant cold energy' of this 'fabulous creature, a European' continues unabated until, that is, Hitler asks her if she has 'ever thought about... how stimulating shit can be?' and grabs her breasts. Hitler's significance seems primarily as a catalyst for change in Audrey's life, as a sort of hyper-racist, megalomaniac guru of self-realisation. After Hitler has been handed over to the Germans, Audrey decides to pursue her 'passion for modernity' and Europeans in particular, and moves to Munich, clutching a small notebook of jottings in German which she believes Hitler left behind. She enters a carnivalesque Europe of Isherwoodian cinema-drones and amorality and makes the outsider's mistake of falling in with the stiffs - bankers, pragmatists and the ancient pterodactyls sipping tea and jangling their bracelets. She attends rants being given by the new sensation, Adolf Hitler, and eventually finds her way to the headquarters of the National Socialist party. In a scene of gruesome anticlimax, she presents Hitler with what she thinks is his notebook and then appears to have nothing else to say, except to pose her own underwhelming 'overwhelming question': 'I have come... to ask if women frighten you.' The Hitler plot appears to be over and the reader is excitedly awaiting an explanation of quite what has been going on, when Audrey undergoes a change of ideology, courtesy of Bello, an African actor, sweaty and sensuous, a man of dark moods, dark passions, a lover and a victim. As a result of Bello, Audrey comes to 'harbour doubts about Nazism' and, after Bello is lynched, is forced to flee Germany. She returns with her 'collection of images' to Australia, where her sister and brother-in-law have just died, true to the Futurist manifesto, in a plane crash. At one point, Audrey finds that, 'suddenly I am at the still centre'. This comes as little surprise to the reader. The driving force of the narrative is the developing character of Audrey; all other personalities, historical figures and artistic movements are subjected to the relentless permutations of self-analysis. Family secrets intertwine with the darkest hours of history; personal traumas are relayed in insistent breathiness, drowning out the shrillness of Nazism. The final twist of the knife, in which Audrey realises that her hold on Hitler was mere fantasy, seems to tip back the scales, return the small people to anonymity; Audrey duly goes home - and the great go to history. It also gives the lie to all Audrey's scene-stealing, but if Audrey was a fantasist after all, then The Day We Had Hitler Home seems little more than a spluttering literary What if?, opening with sensation and ending in irresolution.",

Theroux's hotel of fiction could easily have lapsed into a neat conceit for a book of unconnected stories, but his managerial skill - his artistic consciousness - is magnificent. So do yourself a favour: check in.",

      "body": "<p>The brutal blood sports of cockfighting and dogfighting are on the rise in Britain again, according to animal welfare officials, with dozens of events taking place around the country each weekend.</p> <p>Police wildlife officers and senior officials in the RSPCA have told The Observer that they are receiving record numbers of tip-offs. More than 250 suspected cockfights and 100 dogfights were reported to the RSPCA in the last year alone.</p> <p>Many contests are conducted on a grand scale lasting two or three days and involving dozens of competitors. What was once believed to be a minority sport is fast becoming a major underground industry.</p> <p>The number of prosecutions for cockfighting has increased sharply during the past five years but officials admit the true scale of the problem may be even greater as a large number of fights are not reported at all.</p> <p>The recent rise is being attributed to bouts which take place in inner city locations, particularly in Birmingham, Bradford and Leicester.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of pounds are staked on the contests which often take place in ordinary homes that offer few clues about what goes on inside.</p> <p>Earlier this month, RSPCA inspectors recounted a raid on the terraced home of Javid Iqbal in Birmingham. Inside they found blood spattered at waist height around all four walls of an upstairs room. Inspectors found dozens of videos of staged fights, metal spurs and other items associated with the bloodsport.</p> <p>Investigators believe the case represents merely the tip of the iceberg and that many other private homes are being used for regular bouts. Later this year another Asian man will appear in court charged with using his home for organised quail fighting.</p> <p>Dogfighting, which peaked during the late Eighties, is also on the rise with increasing numbers of banned breeds such as American pit bull terriers being smuggled back into the country. In February, four men received prison sentences after a sophisticated dog-fighting ring was uncovered in Nottinghamshire.</p> <p>'In the wake of the Dangerous Dogs Act, many of the people involved at the highest levels of dog fighting took their animals abroad,' says Chief Superintendent Barry Fryer, head of the RSPCA's Specialist Operations Unit. 'We are now seeing an increasing number of these animals being returned to Britain, even though they are now illegal here. We're not really sure why, but the climate seems to be right for dog fighting once more. Our information indicates that it is on the increase.'</p> <p>Barry Fryer, head of the RSCPA's Specialist Operations Unit, says: 'So far as both activities are concerned, there are certainly fights taking place around the country every weekend. There are a number of individuals who are very active in this barbaric pastime who are well known to us. Sizeable sums of money are often involved. In one raid we found an eight-year-old boy among the spectators.'</p> <p>As well as cockerels, an increasing number of fights are also being staged between quails and partridges. Rather than wearing spurs, these birds have their beaks sharpened with metal files so that pecks to the head inflict far more damage.</p> <p>The owners of the most successful birds can become wealthy through selling chicks from the same bloodline.

      "bodyText": "The brutal blood sports of cockfighting and dogfighting are on the rise in Britain again, according to animal welfare officials, with dozens of events taking place around the country each weekend. Police wildlife officers and senior officials in the RSPCA have told The Observer that they are receiving record numbers of tip-offs. More than 250 suspected cockfights and 100 dogfights were reported to the RSPCA in the last year alone. Many contests are conducted on a grand scale lasting two or three days and involving dozens of competitors. What was once believed to be a minority sport is fast becoming a major underground industry. The number of prosecutions for cockfighting has increased sharply during the past five years but officials admit the true scale of the problem may be even greater as a large number of fights are not reported at all. The recent rise is being attributed to bouts which take place in inner city locations, particularly in Birmingham, Bradford and Leicester. Tens of thousands of pounds are staked on the contests which often take place in ordinary homes that offer few clues about what goes on inside. Earlier this month, RSPCA inspectors recounted a raid on the terraced home of Javid Iqbal in Birmingham. Inside they found blood spattered at waist height around all four walls of an upstairs room. Inspectors found dozens of videos of staged fights, metal spurs and other items associated with the bloodsport. Investigators believe the case represents merely the tip of the iceberg and that many other private homes are being used for regular bouts. Later this year another Asian man will appear in court charged with using his home for organised quail fighting. Dogfighting, which peaked during the late Eighties, is also on the rise with increasing numbers of banned breeds such as American pit bull terriers being smuggled back into the country. In February, four men received prison sentences after a sophisticated dog-fighting ring was uncovered in Nottinghamshire. 'In the wake of the Dangerous Dogs Act, many of the people involved at the highest levels of dog fighting took their animals abroad,' says Chief Superintendent Barry Fryer, head of the RSPCA's Specialist Operations Unit. 'We are now seeing an increasing number of these animals being returned to Britain, even though they are now illegal here. We're not really sure why, but the climate seems to be right for dog fighting once more. Our information indicates that it is on the increase.' Barry Fryer, head of the RSCPA's Specialist Operations Unit, says: 'So far as both activities are concerned, there are certainly fights taking place around the country every weekend. There are a number of individuals who are very active in this barbaric pastime who are well known to us. Sizeable sums of money are often involved. In one raid we found an eight-year-old boy among the spectators.' As well as cockerels, an increasing number of fights are also being staged between quails and partridges. Rather than wearing spurs, these birds have their beaks sharpened with metal files so that pecks to the head inflict far more damage. The owners of the most successful birds can become wealthy through selling chicks from the same bloodline. Some pedigree birds have allegedly changed hands for the sort of sums normally reserved for racehorses. Fights are often videoed so owners can show off the prowess of their stock. Although incidents are on the increase, both sports are built around close-knit communities and notoriously difficult to infiltrate. Changes in the law mean that even being a spectator at a cockfight or possessing equipment that could be used in one are criminal offences. Another trend is that cockfighters from different communities are coming together to compete in 'national' championships. They will often travel hundreds of miles to participate in weekend events which involve dozens of fights. The exact locations remain unknown until the last moment and are revealed on a strict 'need to know' basis.",

      "body": "<p>It can be done, but not if the referee has seen it. </p> <p>To explain: an FA rule states that if a referee has seen an incident, then whatever action he takes, or doesn't, is deemed appropriate, whether he is right or wrong. If he misses it, then the FA can act on their own. Thus did Carlisle's Richard Prokas escape further punishment after his tackle on Patrick Vieira. Thus is Roy Keane's red card and automatic four-match ban for his stud-stabbing of Alf-Inge Haaland - it being his second dismissal of the season - a convenient end to the matter. </p> <p>It is clearly an anomaly, and a rule that needs revising. How is it that Vieira last season could get six matches for spitting and Keane a lesser punishment for assault, the Manchester police having so far declined to get involved? The reason is simply because the referee could not act on one, having already sent off Vieira just before the spitting, but did as much as he could on the other, at least on the day. So far David Elleray is in dereliction of duty; his report did not recommend any further action against Keane and so the FA say they are not considering any.

      "bodyText": "It can be done, but not if the referee has seen it. To explain: an FA rule states that if a referee has seen an incident, then whatever action he takes, or doesn't, is deemed appropriate, whether he is right or wrong. If he misses it, then the FA can act on their own. Thus did Carlisle's Richard Prokas escape further punishment after his tackle on Patrick Vieira. Thus is Roy Keane's red card and automatic four-match ban for his stud-stabbing of Alf-Inge Haaland - it being his second dismissal of the season - a convenient end to the matter. It is clearly an anomaly, and a rule that needs revising. How is it that Vieira last season could get six matches for spitting and Keane a lesser punishment for assault, the Manchester police having so far declined to get involved? The reason is simply because the referee could not act on one, having already sent off Vieira just before the spitting, but did as much as he could on the other, at least on the day. So far David Elleray is in dereliction of duty; his report did not recommend any further action against Keane and so the FA say they are not considering any. Football should follow rugby league's lead. Their video panel is on stand-by to meet on a Monday to consider weekend controversy, whether dealt with by ref or not, and metes out punishment, after which players can appeal.

There were nine minutes on the clock when Carlos Edwards fired in a low cross which Craig Faulconbridge turned into the net. It took Millwall until the 53rd minute to equalise, when Tim Cahill met David Livermore's corner with a powerful header which sparked a joyous pitch invasion, and a three-minute delay. That led to a warning that one more problem would lead to the match being abandoned, prompting a chorus of 'No one likes us, we don't care'. But then it does take a special sort of fan to want to ruin their own party.",

The options were: Mr Vice President, Professor Gore and just plain Mr Gore. At the start of class, Gore dismissed those options, saying: 'You can call me Al', but he preferred 'Your Adequacy', an honorific, he explained, created specifically for former Vice Presidents.</p> <p>That set the tone for my experience with Gore and his class: at once ceremonial and deliberately casual; at times serious, but often pretty funny.</p> <p>When Gore first announced, only days after Bush's inauguration, that he would teach a course at Columbia University called 'Covering National Affairs in the Information Age', there was a flurry of speculation about his intentions. Maybe he was trying to keep from sliding into oblivion, as defeated presidential candidates tend to do. Instead of retreating to his native Carthage, he would make his mark at the most prestigious journalism school in the country and stay at the centre of the New York media establishment. Perhaps it even meant he was getting an early start for the 2004 election. The class, after all, allows Gore a weekly captive audience of future journalists.</p> <p>After showing up on the first day in a tweedy-looking jacket and a burgundy V-neck sweater, Gore toned down the anachronistic Ivy League look to a kind of hip SoHo-casual out fit with both trousers and sweater in downtown black. He had his jacket off as he worked his way through the raised hands, eliciting a lively discussion. Gore's personality problem is not so evident in an academic setting. He is not the wooden obscurantist everyone imagines. He's pretty fast on his feet and most of his jokes are amusing. There are moments when the slightly oily mien of his public persona comes through, but in general, he turns out to be relaxed, witty and charming when not on camera or limited to sound bites.</p> <p>In his first session, on 'how to deal with disagreement among scientists', Gore was animated, even dynamic. Putting in more effort than many full- time professors, he drove the class along not by lecturing but by building on students' comments and pushing them to clarify their answers. Gore was a journalist for almost six years, as an army reporter in Vietnam and as a staff writer at the Nashville Tennessean , so he knows the turf, and his questions were well placed.</p> <p>What if the balance of opinion is so overwhelmingly in favour of one side, like 98% to 2%? What if you know that the dissenters are employed by some industry lobby? What if, by reporting both sides, your article inadvertently suggests to the reader that there is no such thing as global warming? (And allows George W. Bush to say, as he did recently, that he's not sure global warming is real.) The journalism students, indoctrinated to believe that there is such a thing as perfect objectivity, balked. But, they cried, you have to include both sides. Gore responded that 'balance' and 'both sides' don't always bring you closer to the truth.</p> <p>In full sail, Gore decided to chart a course further into the abstract. 'Who can offer a definition of deconstructionism?' he asked. Soon we were discussing the clockwork universe, meta-narratives and the human genome, all in relation to balanced reporting and objectivity. Some students didn't buy it. A student named Mei Fong raised her hand and dismissed the whole thing as 'too high-minded'. (She reiterated her point by saying, twice: 'I'm not pulling this out of my ass.') 'Reporters,' she said, 'want the meat, the bone and the juice.' The rest, Mei suggested, is not important.</p> <p>Gore's answer was impressive. 'All that is to say that some meanings come not only from the facts, or from balance, but from the relationship between all the story's components.' This was the Gore I had always heard about, the one who is busy with thought, who likes to weave different conceptual threads into one cohesive idea.</p> <p>The following week, we had the first of several visiting speakers. Gore had invited Rupert Murdoch to class to discuss corporate consolidation of the media. It was a topic close to Gore's heart (his undergraduate thesis examined the effect of television on politics) and he had prepared some questions for Murdoch to start with. Unfortunately, they were mostly softballs, or they came across that way. That's not to say that Gore didn't try. He asked about bias in the press, news owners participating in editorial decisions, and even about Murdoch's personal record on these issues, and yet almost all the queries landed at Murdoch's feet.</p> <p>People brought up the usual News Corporation scandals: the South China Morning Post ; Murdoch's withdrawal of BBC distribution from his Star TV network in China - HarperCollins's book deal with Deng Xiaoping's daughter - but he maintained his sort-of-imperial air and explained it all away.</p> <p>Towards the end of the session, The Simpsons came up. 'I believe The Simpsons is the best show that has ever been on television,' Murdoch said quite proudly. Who can argue with that? Smiles all around. Any critical mass that might have gathered against him in the past hour and a half dissipated. All evil media moguls should have such an ace in the hole.</p> <p>When we found out that the third class would address the role of financial journalism and the guest was Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, the joke went around that session four would be about covering religion and the guest would be the Pope, or if he's unavailable, God.</p> <p>The following week, David Letterman was brought in with two of his writers to talk about political humour. Initially, they were glib. 'People read the funnies before they read the front page of the newspaper,' Letterman said. But Gore didn't let them off the hook. He pressed the subject and, by the end, his guests came around a bit. They even listened as Gore drew flow-charts and talked for a while about meta-narratives, by which he meant the shared assumptions people have about public figures. 'Like Gore is stiff, Bush jumbles words and Clinton loves cheeseburgers,' he explained.</p> <p>As class ended, someone near me sniped: 'What a show-off.' This is a consistent reaction from some of the students. Gore swaggers, they say. He's always posturing. And he flaunts his intelligence. There is, of course, an element of exhibition here. So what? Gore is not, to strike a theme, pulling this stuff out of his ass; he is in full command of his ideas. Maybe he does get a little esoteric, but it's refreshing to encounter a politician who not only knows what he's talking about but might have something important to say on the subject.</p> <p>Part of Gore's political failure, we hear, is that he always sounds as though he is leading a graduate seminar.

      "body": "<p>Perhaps Simon Rattle was hungry when we met at Glyndebourne (where he is rehearsing a new production of Beethoven's Fidelio , due to open the season on May 17). Or perhaps music is his food, because - even after instantly transforming a plate of moussaka and roast potatoes into nervous energy - he went on comparing operas with meals. </p> <p>Recalling Rameau's mythological romp Les Bor\u00e9ades , which he conducted at Salzburg and the Proms in 1999, he said: 'It's the world's greatest tapas bar. The whole of the food chain is there, but snack-sized.' And when I commented on his thinness, he beamed 'I'm still on the Tristan diet.' He has just conducted Wagner's Tristan und Isolde for the first time in Amsterdam, and despite the narcosis of the music he managed to be invigorated by it. </p> <p>'You're in a sea of amniotic fluid. Some of the time it made me want to lie down in a foetal position on the rostrum and sob. But in the end it lifts you off the ground. It's not a cholesterol high, like Syzmanowski's King Roger - there's so much exotic sweetness in that, you can feel it shortening your life.' </p> <p>Wagner worried that the febrile chromaticism of Tristan might drive men mad. Rattle sees it more medicinally, and believes that the score saved the life of Claudio Abbado (whom he will succeed next year as chief conductor and artistic director of the Berlin Philharmonic). Abbado lost most of his viscerae after an operation for cancer, but resurrected himself by conducting Tristan - despite its erotic morbidity, its longing for extinction - in Japan. He recently told Rattle that he thought he would overcome his illness if he could find a way both to eat (since his digestive system is now outside his body) and to conduct. </p> <p>There is a strange metabolism at work in conducting itself, which takes ideas - those silent symbols in the score - and converts them into sound. Like eating in reverse, it gives a disembodied, diagrammatic thought flesh and blood, and makes it a sensation. How Rattle must have licked his lips when he began to study the score of Fidelio two years ago, because what he found there had probably not been heard since the nineteenth century: tempo markings fleeter than usual (the prisoners' chorus, he points out, usually so mournful, should be allegretto), and a vocal style which evokes Italian bel canto, not the stentorian rhetoric of Wagner. </p> <p>Rattle, with his vivid auditory imagination, says that he heard the music 'walk' with a different tread. He compares Fidelio - usually so deliberate and dogged, a triumphal march of archetypes - with the twisting, emotionally circuitous journey in Schubert's song cycle Die Winterreise. ' Tristan for me is Schubert on steroids, but this somehow permits Schubert to exist. It's all so subtle and delicate. When Rocco sings his aria about money, you can hear that he's not telling the truth. He tries to keep it in B flat major, but it's actually in G minor. The whole thing has to move in the way we know Beethoven played the piano - skittish, bizarre, not one steady pulse.' With his rare gift for verbalising, Rattle wants the same from his singers: they must, he says, 'pronounce' the music, deciphering the feelings caged in the notes. The orchestra, too, is engaged in articulate speech. </p> <p>On the day we met, Rattle was still conducting an invisible, inaudible band, gesticulating in an empty pit. The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment is due to arrive tomorrow: this will be the first Fidelio ever played on period instruments, and Rattle says he can't wait to hear how the horns will utter Beethoven's sounds - 'all those sharp, buzzing colours'. He continues to conduct Beethoven's symphonies with orchestras of the later, lusher kind, and this season performed the Fifth with the Vienna Philharmonic in London. But, as he insists, 'These pieces don't need helmets' and he was delighted when the VPO, 'the boys', as he fondly calls them - allowed him to goad them on a madly propulsive, impishly athletic race through a score they already knew so well: 'They're supposed to be conservative, but they were willing to explore this other way of doing it. I suppose they think \"Let's humour Simon\" - a bit like the way the grown-ups humour ET.' More likely, of course, they capitulated to the enthusiasm and elation of a genuine visionary, who has re-conceived the most familiar and revered of composers, dispensing with a ponderous tradition. </p> <p>By the end of the nineteenth century, Beethoven had become a model of knotty Promethean intellect: sculpted by Max Klinger, he glowers on a rocky pinnacle in the pavilion of the Vienna Secession, with Christ crucified on the rear of his throne. In the twentieth century, 'Fidelio' and the Ninth Symphony were used as anthems of resurgent humanism - music to accompany the liberation of the concentration camps or the breaching of the Berlin Wall. Beethoven, as a certified classic, had become sacrosanct, as monumental as Klinger's glowering effigy of him. </p> <p>Rattle - casually demonstrating a novelist's capacity to conjure up Beethoven's physical presence and intuit his psychological quirks - seeks to make the music sound as it did to its first hearers, who were terrified by its messianic frenzy. 'Goethe should have been able to keep up with Beethoven, because the second part of \"Faust\" is as apocalyptic as any of his music, but he fled after nine days with him. He just couldn't stand the wildness. Mendelssohn, when he heard the Fifth Symphony, said that it threatened to make the planets fall off their axes. Weber walked out of the Seventh, and called it music fit only for the asylum. Beethoven was always asking to have this or that mountain moved just a foot or so to the left. This was a man who stuck his hat on his head and stomped off, pushing through the middle of a royal procession. He even managed to spill wine and coffee inside his own piano, which is some achievement. Did you ever meet the conductor Klaus Tennstedt? That's how I imagine Beethoven. Steps were made for falling up. No piece of furniture was safe when he was in the room - especially if it happened to be expensive. He didn't inhabit the real world, and his music had unreal expectations of performers.' </p> <p>The unreality extends, in some performances of Fidelio, to human nature: did Beethoven idealise Leonore and Florestan, those prisoners of conscience, and demonise their oppressor Pizarro? </p> <p>For Rattle, and for the director Deborah Warner, these are all fallible, morally compromised beings. Rattle has imagined a novel which elaborates on their relationships, and inveigles them into a seamy complicity behind the scenes. 'There's no right and wrong in a post-revolutionary time. Even Mandela, who's a living saint, was involved in an armed struggle. Pizarro says that Florestan, whom everyone thinks of as a victim, was a murderer too. I suspect that Leonore, supposedly the ideal woman, has had some secret relationship with Pizarro. And what happens at the end, while everyone's rejoicing? I think they take Pizarro off and lynch him. There are atrocities and betrayals - political and sexual - in the background which no one will ever speak about.' </p> <p>The proper response to Fidelio is not liberal complacency. Rattle is hoping for the same shock - both musical and dramatic - delivered by his Don Giovanni with Deborah Warner at Glyndebourne in 1991. That concluded with a blasphemous orgy during which the libertine defiled a statuette of the Virgin Mary. </p> <p>'By the end of the first performance, there was a message on the noticeboard at the stage door asking Deborah to please phone the editor of the Catholic Herald. That proved we'd succeeded.' Before leaving, I asked Rattle if he had a wish list of operas. Glyndebourne's cancellation of Rameau's Hippolyte et Aricie rankles, but Wagner's Ring and Berg's Lulu seem to be on his mind: maybe, he said, 'The Germans', which is how he refers to the Berlin Philharmonic - will do them. </p> <p>He is still oddly wary of Verdi: 'Until I can sit through Ballo in Maschera , I don't think I should be allowed to do Falstaff . I only heard Otello for the first time a few years ago. I'd never even heard a note of it on record. So I got to know it sitting with Bernard Haitink in a box at Covent Garden, watching Carlos Kleiber conduct.' Rattle's face ignited at the memory of Kleiber's wizardry, as his downbeat caused a storm at sea to explode out of the orchestra pit. 'Bernard turned to me in the middle of the first act and whispered \"Simon, I think my studies have just begun\".' </p> <p>Rattle has conserved the same open-minded capacity for admiration, and the same giddy, almost adolescent delight in what he does. He was so precocious - he learned music at five, mounted his first concerts (domestically) at six, and conducted an occult score by Boulez when he was 15 - and is still so young that we have an entire career to look forward to. By the way, I have solved the mystery of his hair. Those corkscrew curls, grey but still resilient, have always fascinated me. Surely he doesn't have time for sessions with heated tongs? I think, after our lunch, that I know the follicular secret. Coils store energy, and release it when shaken (or, perhaps, rattled). What makes Rattle's hair curl is its sheer excitement at growing out of his brain.</p>",

Rattle's face ignited at the memory of Kleiber's wizardry, as his downbeat caused a storm at sea to explode out of the orchestra pit. 'Bernard turned to me in the middle of the first act and whispered \"Simon, I think my studies have just begun\".' Rattle has conserved the same open-minded capacity for admiration, and the same giddy, almost adolescent delight in what he does. He was so precocious - he learned music at five, mounted his first concerts (domestically) at six, and conducted an occult score by Boulez when he was 15 - and is still so young that we have an entire career to look forward to. By the way, I have solved the mystery of his hair. Those corkscrew curls, grey but still resilient, have always fascinated me. Surely he doesn't have time for sessions with heated tongs? I think, after our lunch, that I know the follicular secret. Coils store energy, and release it when shaken (or, perhaps, rattled). What makes Rattle's hair curl is its sheer excitement at growing out of his brain.",

      "body": "<p><strong> The Mexican </strong> (124 mins, 15) Directed by Gore Verbinski; starring Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini </p> <p><strong> The Captive</strong> (112 mins, 15) Directed by Chantal Akerman; starring Stanilas Merhar, Sylvie Testud, Olivia Bonamy </p> <p><strong> Exit Wounds</strong> (100 mins, 15) Directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak; starring Steven Seagal, Isaiah Washington, DMX, Bill Duke </p> <p> A quarter of a century ago, Sam Peckinpah made a movie called Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia , which was initially reviled by most critics, largely rejected by the public and is now regarded as a classic. Writing about it favourably in The Observer got me into Private Eye 's Pseuds Corner. Gore Verbinski's <strong> The Mexican</strong> is largely a reworking of Alfredo Garcia but it's a pretty feeble film, and if I were to say that the best thing about it is James Gandolfini's touching and amusing performance as a philosophical gay hitman I doubt if the observation would get me into Pseuds Corner, though at one time it might well have. </p> <p>In Peckinpah's movie, a seedy American loser (played by Warren Oates) goes in search of a Mexican lothario on whose head a price has been put by a proud, wealthy hidalgo. He discovers the man is dead and goes after the buried body. Others, both American and Mexican, join in the quest, and as the severed head changes hands, a trail of corpses is left across Mexico. </p> <p>In The Mexican, Jerry (Brad Pitt), a handsome American drifter, is given a chance to redeem himself (and save his life) by finding a legendary nineteenth-century Mexican pistol. Otherwise, the story is much the same, though more jocular in intent and less resonant. This commission to get the gun comes from a shady Los Angeles businessman, Nayman (sneaky Bob Balaban), who's working for a criminal called Bernie, who holds Jerry responsible for a jail sentence he's serving. </p> <p>To complicate an already incoherent story, Jerry's lover, Samantha (Julia Roberts), is planning to leave him. While he's down in Old Mexico she heads for Las Vegas and they don't meet again until the picture's halfway over. This is just as well, perhaps, because she's either screeching at him or talking the sort of psychobabble that comes from reading self-help books like Men Who Can't Love . Typical of her discourse is the question: 'If two people love each other and they can't seem to get it together, when do you reach that point when enough is enough?' </p> <p> En route to Vegas, Samantha is abducted by a gay hitman working for Nayman (or is it Bernie?) played by Gandolfini, who rescues her from a black hitman working for Bernie (or is it Nayman?).

      "bodyText": "The Mexican (124 mins, 15) Directed by Gore Verbinski; starring Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini The Captive (112 mins, 15) Directed by Chantal Akerman; starring Stanilas Merhar, Sylvie Testud, Olivia Bonamy Exit Wounds (100 mins, 15) Directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak; starring Steven Seagal, Isaiah Washington, DMX, Bill Duke A quarter of a century ago, Sam Peckinpah made a movie called Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia , which was initially reviled by most critics, largely rejected by the public and is now regarded as a classic. Writing about it favourably in The Observer got me into Private Eye 's Pseuds Corner. Gore Verbinski's The Mexican is largely a reworking of Alfredo Garcia but it's a pretty feeble film, and if I were to say that the best thing about it is James Gandolfini's touching and amusing performance as a philosophical gay hitman I doubt if the observation would get me into Pseuds Corner, though at one time it might well have. In Peckinpah's movie, a seedy American loser (played by Warren Oates) goes in search of a Mexican lothario on whose head a price has been put by a proud, wealthy hidalgo. He discovers the man is dead and goes after the buried body. Others, both American and Mexican, join in the quest, and as the severed head changes hands, a trail of corpses is left across Mexico. In The Mexican, Jerry (Brad Pitt), a handsome American drifter, is given a chance to redeem himself (and save his life) by finding a legendary nineteenth-century Mexican pistol. Otherwise, the story is much the same, though more jocular in intent and less resonant. This commission to get the gun comes from a shady Los Angeles businessman, Nayman (sneaky Bob Balaban), who's working for a criminal called Bernie, who holds Jerry responsible for a jail sentence he's serving. To complicate an already incoherent story, Jerry's lover, Samantha (Julia Roberts), is planning to leave him. While he's down in Old Mexico she heads for Las Vegas and they don't meet again until the picture's halfway over. This is just as well, perhaps, because she's either screeching at him or talking the sort of psychobabble that comes from reading self-help books like Men Who Can't Love . Typical of her discourse is the question: 'If two people love each other and they can't seem to get it together, when do you reach that point when enough is enough?' En route to Vegas, Samantha is abducted by a gay hitman working for Nayman (or is it Bernie?) played by Gandolfini, who rescues her from a black hitman working for Bernie (or is it Nayman?). She's very amused when Gandolfini picks up another gay, a bald postman who holidays in Vegas, to cleanse himself of the pornography he has to deliver the year round. Believe me, this is more engaging than Jerry's travails in Mexico. There are two moderately interesting aspects to The Mexican .

After establishing a theatre for the performance of works by Gilbert and Sullivan, Richard D'Oyly Carte built the Savoy Hotel next door, specifying 70 bathrooms, electricity and 'two ascending rooms' (the first lifts in London). A brilliant entrepreneur and musician, he engineered and massaged the often irascible partnership between composer and librettist, and benefited richly from the outcome. </p> <p>More than a century later, the Savoy Hotel looks decidedly more solid than the paper-thin works that helped finance it. Last week the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company began an extended run at its old home with Stuart Maunder's breezy production of <b> The Pirates of Penzance</b>. The enterprise is 'presented by' Raymond Gubbay, a similarly ingenious impresario of our times. His talents, as yet, have not extended to real estate on a grand scale or inspired the creation of a new English Comic Opera theatre (or any new commission, come to that?). He could steal a leaf from D'Oyly Carte's book. </p> <p> Pirates, less biting in its social satire than, say, Patience or Iolanthe ), has one of Gilbert's daftest plots, with a resolution so swift and weak that you think you must have misunderstood it. Without doubt there is much pleasure to be derived from the tuneful score, which includes the wittily endless Policeman's Chorus and the evergreen 'I am the very model of a modern major-general'. The problem with Sullivan's music is that, being largely second-hand, it is hard to tell if he is parodying, pastiching, paraphrasing or simply pilfering it. The chorus and orchestra, crisply conducted by John Owen Edwards, acquitted themselves ably. </p> <p>These Cornish pirates, as fresh and scrubbed as Eliza Doolittle after her bath, may have felt sorely constricted by the tightness of their stripy leggings but if so didn't show it. And how they kept their frilly shirts so crisp and dazzling white with all that rough living is a laundering secret we'd all like to learn. The women, too, decked out as spotless Bo-Peeps with lacy parasols, had well-drilled charm. In most other respects the evening was a struggle. </p> <p>With the exception of Gareth Jones, a seasoned Sergeant of Police, the soloists were not equipped to sing Sullivan's music, technically or stylistically. Charlotte Page, though sometimes uneasy in the coloratura, managed a silvery-voiced Mabel but Royce Mills as the Major-General missed the opening beat in his big song and never recovered. As Frederic the dashing hero, Tim Rogers, a cross between Hugh Grant and Ian Bostridge, certainly looked the part, though he lacked Bostridge's certainty of key, or any other of his vocal skills. To use Gilbert's words, modified rapture. </p> <p>Bostridge (with an immaculate sense of pitch) shone in darker fare earlier in the week. Together with Thomas Ad\u00e8s as pianist and the lustrous-voiced mezzo Ruby Philogene, he performed Jan\u00e1cek's <b> The Diary of One Who Disappeared</b> in the newly restored, acoustically responsive surroundings of St George's, Bristol, now surely one of the best small concert halls in the country. This song-cycle cum chamber opera (staged in 1999 by Deborah Warner for Bostridge and Philogene) relates the fateful story of a gypsy girl who lures a young farmer's son into her thrall. Bostridge, relishing the Czech vowel sounds, conveyed the torn feelings of the boy with fearless intensity, power and range of expression. </p> <p>Ad\u00e8s shaped each phrase, each black climax, with superb, emphatic control. He also played Jan\u00e1cek's 15 Moravian Folk Songs and his own 1992 work Darkenesse Visible, which he calls an 'explosion' of Dowland's 1610 lute song, 'In Darkenesse Let Mee Dwell'. From a fluttering of high trills, fast and fine as the beat of insect wings, Dowland's chaste song emerges. Ad\u00e8s made the piano ring out with such resonance it might have been electronically prepared. A recording of the Jan\u00e1cek follows shortly, and is keenly awaited. </p> <p>Until now, Rolf Hind has been known more as a pianist who composes rather than, like Ad\u00e8s or Britten, a composer who plays the piano. His two delicately detailed short works for prepared piano, Cloud Shadow/Solgata, were included in <b>State of the Nation</b>, the London Sinfonietta's weekend of music by 'young and emerging' composers. For those unable to attend the numerous workshops and concerts, Radio 3 provided a generous late-night digest. In addition to Hind's works, Tansy Davies's Small Black Stone was memorable. This distinctive, intricately textured work for viola and piano (played by Paul Silverthorne and John Constable) managed to free the instrument from its usual confused status as low violin or high cello. Richard Ayres's hugely enjoyable No 24, a 'Noncerto' for alto trombone and ensemble is not new (it was written in 1995) but stood out for its wit and invention. The soloist, David Purser, employed tin cans, paper plates and other devices in this Kagel-esque exploration of the concerto tradition. </p> <p>Some of these composers can expect to land a Proms commission in the next few years. A few - Joby Talbot stands out - are ready now. Nicholas Kenyon, director of the Proms, has announced 10 BBC commissions and a further 11 premieres this season. So far the most talked about is Sally Beamish's Knotgrass Elegy. Her oratorio is inspired by Graham Harvey's book The Killing of the Countryside , fitting in with this year's theme of Pastoral, now all too ironic a choice. If setting pesticides and agrichemicals to music all sounds rather earth-bound, John Tavener's Song of the Cosmos 'deals with fundamental issues of spirituality, existence and metaphysics'.

      "body": "<p><strong> Bolshoi Ballet</strong> Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London WC2 </p> <p><strong> Stravinsky Staged</strong> Royal Ballet, ROH, London WC2 </p> <p><strong> Bounce</strong> Roundhouse, London NW1 </p> <p> Ballet's most baffling convention dominates the <strong> Bolshoi</strong>'s opening programme. As soon as each piece gets going, everything grinds to a halt for the soloists to take their bows; they recommence, only to solicit more applause. They are billed as 'Stars of the Bolshoi Ballet', so each performer requires acknowledgement. Programme One starts, however, with Swan Lake Act II as a company showcase. What kind of art form is this that requires swan maidens in distress to paddle in and out of the wings for yet another bout of curtseys? </p> <p>Thursday's Odette was Anna Antonicheva, leading a retinue of 26 slender-legged swans. The rest of the short programme consists of pas de deux. It is an unsatisfactory format, for these are not razzle-dazzle performers but fine interpretive artists. In the past, heavyweight Bolshoi stars would wow the workers; the new breed of dancers is slighter in build, less extrovert. </p> <p>Antonicheva is a lovely Swan Queen, with an expressive, unforced line but no story to tell. The staging, attributed to Yuri Grigorovich, is fussy, filled with restless swans. Instead of sustaining the singing quality of each dance sequence, this mannered production proceeds in fits and starts. Antonicheva, ably partnered by Andrei Uvarov, cannot find the emotional core of the ballet; hers is an abstract outline of a role. </p> <p>Svetlana Lunkina, the other lyrical ballerina of the evening, captures the whole of Giselle Act II in just an extract from it. She shows Giselle's dual nature, torn between her Wili destiny and her love for Albrecht - Uvarov again, this time dancing with passion. Lunkina, still only 21, registers at once as the real thing. Yet her sensitive pas de deux is followed by the brash grand pas from Don Quixote , brusquely performed by Maria Alexandrova, who has a way to go before she is a ballerina. It is a bumpy evening, with strong, unflashy dancing by the men and some charming soloists; the content, though, is thin and heartless. </p> <p>To experience how astonishing and moving ballet can be, see the Royal Ballet's <strong>Stravinsky</strong> programme. This is the modern heritage the Bolshoi hasn't yet claimed. Lucky us to have grown up with Fokine's Firebird and Nijinska's Les Noces in the Royal repertoire; lucky New Yorkers to have had Balanchine and Stravinsky making ballets such as Agon on their doorstep. These are works that yield more every time you watch them. </p> <p>Anthony Dowell has chosen an excellent triple bill, the three very different ballets revealing their common lineage. The Firebird (1910) and Les Noces (1923) are both Russian courtship rituals, culminating in an awesome community celebration. Fokine set out the folk-dance patterns in The Firebird that Nijinska turned into modern dance in Les Noces. Natalia Gontcharova's designs for The Firebird look like Russian fairy-tale paintings; for Les Noces, she was coerced into minimalist austerity. Dressed in brown and white, the performers become the pounding keys of the four pianos in the pit. </p> <p>In Agon (1957), dancers in practice dress are instruments in the musical collaboration between Stravinsky and Balanchine. At times, the conductor,John Carewe, takes his cue from the stage, waiting for a soloist to hit the height of his jump before bringing his baton down. Johan Kobborg, the leaper in question, is as honed as a switchblade. A Dane, he knows the Balanchine technique from his home company's repertoire; so does Jaimie Tapper from Canada. The Royal Ballet's products are less secure, though Zenaida Yanowsky is discovering that she can indeed rival Darcey Bussell in the lethal pas de deux with Carlos Acosta. </p> <p> Agon can make you laugh and cry; Les Noces is a major tearjerker. Its ferocious energy beats anything the <strong> Bounce </strong> Streetdance Company from Sweden can manage. Suitably multicultural, their contemporary folk-dance routines - locking, B-boying, boogaloo, rapping, heavy-metal tapping - are blandly synthetic. The emphasis is not on individual skills and inspiration but on unison showbiz choreography. No rough edges, except on Lez Brotherston's junk-yard set. Instead of asking the audience to clap along, with applause breaks as frequent as the Bolshoi's, they should clear a space and let the locals show what they can do.</p>",

As soon as each piece gets going, everything grinds to a halt for the soloists to take their bows; they recommence, only to solicit more applause. They are billed as 'Stars of the Bolshoi Ballet', so each performer requires acknowledgement. Programme One starts, however, with Swan Lake Act II as a company showcase. What kind of art form is this that requires swan maidens in distress to paddle in and out of the wings for yet another bout of curtseys? Thursday's Odette was Anna Antonicheva, leading a retinue of 26 slender-legged swans. The rest of the short programme consists of pas de deux. It is an unsatisfactory format, for these are not razzle-dazzle performers but fine interpretive artists. In the past, heavyweight Bolshoi stars would wow the workers; the new breed of dancers is slighter in build, less extrovert. Antonicheva is a lovely Swan Queen, with an expressive, unforced line but no story to tell. The staging, attributed to Yuri Grigorovich, is fussy, filled with restless swans. Instead of sustaining the singing quality of each dance sequence, this mannered production proceeds in fits and starts. Antonicheva, ably partnered by Andrei Uvarov, cannot find the emotional core of the ballet; hers is an abstract outline of a role. Svetlana Lunkina, the other lyrical ballerina of the evening, captures the whole of Giselle Act II in just an extract from it. She shows Giselle's dual nature, torn between her Wili destiny and her love for Albrecht - Uvarov again, this time dancing with passion. Lunkina, still only 21, registers at once as the real thing. Yet her sensitive pas de deux is followed by the brash grand pas from Don Quixote , brusquely performed by Maria Alexandrova, who has a way to go before she is a ballerina. It is a bumpy evening, with strong, unflashy dancing by the men and some charming soloists; the content, though, is thin and heartless. To experience how astonishing and moving ballet can be, see the Royal Ballet's Stravinsky programme. This is the modern heritage the Bolshoi hasn't yet claimed. Lucky us to have grown up with Fokine's Firebird and Nijinska's Les Noces in the Royal repertoire; lucky New Yorkers to have had Balanchine and Stravinsky making ballets such as Agon on their doorstep. These are works that yield more every time you watch them. Anthony Dowell has chosen an excellent triple bill, the three very different ballets revealing their common lineage. The Firebird (1910) and Les Noces (1923) are both Russian courtship rituals, culminating in an awesome community celebration. Fokine set out the folk-dance patterns in The Firebird that Nijinska turned into modern dance in Les Noces. Natalia Gontcharova's designs for The Firebird look like Russian fairy-tale paintings; for Les Noces, she was coerced into minimalist austerity. Dressed in brown and white, the performers become the pounding keys of the four pianos in the pit. In Agon (1957), dancers in practice dress are instruments in the musical collaboration between Stravinsky and Balanchine. At times, the conductor,John Carewe, takes his cue from the stage, waiting for a soloist to hit the height of his jump before bringing his baton down. Johan Kobborg, the leaper in question, is as honed as a switchblade. A Dane, he knows the Balanchine technique from his home company's repertoire; so does Jaimie Tapper from Canada. The Royal Ballet's products are less secure, though Zenaida Yanowsky is discovering that she can indeed rival Darcey Bussell in the lethal pas de deux with Carlos Acosta. Agon can make you laugh and cry; Les Noces is a major tearjerker. Its ferocious energy beats anything the Bounce Streetdance Company from Sweden can manage. Suitably multicultural, their contemporary folk-dance routines - locking, B-boying, boogaloo, rapping, heavy-metal tapping - are blandly synthetic. The emphasis is not on individual skills and inspiration but on unison showbiz choreography. No rough edges, except on Lez Brotherston's junk-yard set. Instead of asking the audience to clap along, with applause breaks as frequent as the Bolshoi's, they should clear a space and let the locals show what they can do.",

If Spirit of the Century marked something of a departure, tonight, fresh from a rapturous reception on Later With Jools Holland , the veteran singers are happy to go through the old routine.

The lean backing band - guitar, bass and drums - ensures that little detracts from their voices, although they are more potent singing a cappella.

The songs split between grave sermons and more uplifting fare, and it's plain to see which ones are better received. 'Run On for a Long Time', already familiar to Moby fans, is a showstopper. Fountain and co-singer George Scott, who have been seated, occasionally rise to their feet, the former treating us to a huge grin and lascivious hip swivel.

      "body": "<p>'He doesn't like talking about Talking Heads,' an anxious press officer warns me before my audience with David Byrne, one-time wild-eyed leader of the thinking person's rock group. And why should he have to? Though Byrne will always remain the twitchy oddball immortalised in Stop Making Sense, Jonathan Demme's film portrait of the band, it's been 10 years now since he formally dissolved the Heads. Since then, he's released four fine solo albums and a whole heap more by other people on his splendidly eclectic Luaka Bop label. </p> <p>Though his conversational style remains jerky, full of pregnant pauses and rearrangements of his lanky limbs, Byrne is no longer the angst-soaked figure of old. Slim, dapper and with a brush of platinum-grey hair, at 48 he remains in dauntingly good shape, looking as much like a Cornell mathematics professor as a pop star. His ease is apparent on his new album, Look Into the Eyeball , whose dozen tightly constructed vignettes add up to the best record of his solo career. It is, I suggest, also his most personal record, lighter of touch, less... </p> <p>'Paranoid?' offers Byrne, arcing an eyebrow. 'Yes, uh, yes, absolutely. My intention was that the songs have a melancholy edge while being uplifting and celebratory. For example, on 'Like Humans Do', which I guess is the single, I'm celebrating humans with all their faults. Yes, they're odd, dirty and disappointing, but they're OK; I'm gonna do my best to be like them.' </p> <p> Look Into the Eyeball, however, is not all light and forgiveness. The opener, 'UB Jesus', takes a well-aimed swipe at Christian fundamentalism, while 'Moment of Conception' rebels against the notion that we can blame all our faults on our genes, what Byrne describes as 'the sociopath's take on sin - it's not my fault'. Other tracks, like 'Everyone's In Love With You' and 'The Revolution', are carefully observed takes on the tics and conceits of human behaviour, all set to beautifully wrought string arrangements from a well-chosen list of collaborators and underpinned by subtle Latin rhythms. </p> <p>Given the brevity of its songs - several of them clock in at under three minutes - and its lyrical poise, it's a surprise to learn that the album was intended as a series of lengthy instrumentals, and that Byrne habitually writes his music first, words second. 'I've got nothing to say most of the time,' he shrugs. 'I don't think, \"Here's what's troubling me, I'm gonna write a song about it\". I use a stream-of-consciousness approach; if you don't censor yourself, you end up with what you're most concerned about, but you haven't filtered it through your conscious mind. Then you craft it.' </p> <p>Making his own music, though, has become a part-time job for Byrne. Luaka Bop is no vanity project, but a business responsible for a series of inspired releases - most reflecting Byrne's passion for all things Latin - and a roster that includes Brazilian singer/poet Tom Z\u00e9, Peruvian singer Susana Baca, militant Mexican rockers Los De Abajo and Southern surrealist Jim White. Don't, however, mention the 'w' word, for which Byrne's contempt was eloquently expressed in an article for the New York Times, provocatively titled 'Why I Hate World Music'. </p> <p>A long-time New York resident, Byrne lives, as he puts it, 'above the shop', meaning Luaka Bop employees sometimes arrive at the office to find the boss there in his pyjamas. 'I try to devote my afternoons to making music in my home studio,' he says, 'but it's a lot more fun hanging out with musicians and friends, and trying subtly to influence a band than making your own stuff.' </p> <p>Then there are the various 'projects'. Back in the mid Eighties, when he directed True Stories, a portrait of real-life Texan mavericks, it seemed that Byrne might add a cinematic career to his musical portfolio. Various scripts have been developed. 'One got as far as being costed, but when it turned out it was a $10m art film, it got shelved. I don't like begging money from producers. If I hit a dead end I, think, \"Oh, I'll write some songs instead\". But when you get to do it, it's better than making a record; it's the biggest ego ride in the world.' </p> <p>Byrne, once dubbed 'rock's renaissance man' by Time (to his embarrassment), has kept other interests in play. He continues to take photos, retains a keen interest in the art world. He remains married to fashion designer Bonnie Lutz, with whom he has an 11-year-old daughter. 'Yeah, I'm still married; isn't that amazing?' he asks with apparently genuine surprise. 'The assumption is that your personal life has to be a mess to create, but how much chaos can you allow in before it takes over?' </p> <p>Does he never get nostalgic for the days when he could command a Time cover? 'Occasionally, I hanker for the time when I sold more records, but I don't sit and drool about it. When I do look at early footage of Talking Heads, I realise I was just a wreck. Mentally, I was a mess. I see this guy who was... well, I'm still far from being Mr Gregarious, but then I was just an emotional cripple whose only outlet was to get on stage. This is how I/he communicated. It's painful to watch.' </p> <p>With that, Byrne gives the fulsome laugh of a fully paid-up member of the human race. </p> <p>\u0095 Look Into the Eyeball is released by Virgin Records on 7 May</p>",

A long-time New York resident, Byrne lives, as he puts it, 'above the shop', meaning Luaka Bop employees sometimes arrive at the office to find the boss there in his pyjamas. 'I try to devote my afternoons to making music in my home studio,' he says, 'but it's a lot more fun hanging out with musicians and friends, and trying subtly to influence a band than making your own stuff.' Then there are the various 'projects'. Back in the mid Eighties, when he directed True Stories, a portrait of real-life Texan mavericks, it seemed that Byrne might add a cinematic career to his musical portfolio. Various scripts have been developed. 'One got as far as being costed, but when it turned out it was a $10m art film, it got shelved. I don't like begging money from producers. If I hit a dead end I, think, \"Oh, I'll write some songs instead\". But when you get to do it, it's better than making a record; it's the biggest ego ride in the world.' Byrne, once dubbed 'rock's renaissance man' by Time (to his embarrassment), has kept other interests in play. He continues to take photos, retains a keen interest in the art world. He remains married to fashion designer Bonnie Lutz, with whom he has an 11-year-old daughter. 'Yeah, I'm still married; isn't that amazing?' he asks with apparently genuine surprise. 'The assumption is that your personal life has to be a mess to create, but how much chaos can you allow in before it takes over?' Does he never get nostalgic for the days when he could command a Time cover? 'Occasionally, I hanker for the time when I sold more records, but I don't sit and drool about it. When I do look at early footage of Talking Heads, I realise I was just a wreck. Mentally, I was a mess. I see this guy who was... well, I'm still far from being Mr Gregarious, but then I was just an emotional cripple whose only outlet was to get on stage. This is how I/he communicated. It's painful to watch.' With that, Byrne gives the fulsome laugh of a fully paid-up member of the human race. \u0095 Look Into the Eyeball is released by Virgin Records on 7 May",

      "body": "<p>In mid-20th century Colombia, it wasn't enough to hurt or even kill your enemy; there was ritual to be observed. Rape had to be performed in public, before fathers, mothers, husbands, sisters, brothers, sons, and daughters. And before you killed a man, you first made him beg, scream and gag\u0085 or first you killed those he most loved before his eyes. To amplify revulsion and fear, victims were horribly mutilated and left on display. Children were killed not by accident but slowly, with pleasure. Severed heads were left on pikes along public roads. The joke Colombians told was that God had made their land so beautiful, so rich in every natural way, that it was unfair to the rest of the world; He had evened the score by populating it with the most evil race of men.</p> <p>It was here that the greatest outlaw in history, Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria, was born, on 1 December 1949. Anyone can be a criminal, but to be an outlaw demands a following. The outlaw stands for something, usually through no effort of his own. No matter how base the actual motives of criminals like those in the Colombian hills, or like the American ones immortalised by Hollywood - Al Capone, Bonnie and Clyde, Jesse James - large numbers of average people rooted for them and followed their bloody exploits with some measure of delight. Pablo Escobar would build on these myths. While the other outlaws remained strictly local heroes, meaningful only as symbols, his power would become both international and real. At his peak, he would threaten to usurp the Colombian state. Forbes magazine would list him as the seventh richest man in the world in 1989. His violent reach would make him the most feared terrorist in the world.</p> <p>Pablo did not grow up poor, as he and his hired publicists would sometimes later claim. When Pablo was born, his father Abel owned a house, 12 hectares and six cows in Rionegro, in the outlying districts of Medell\u00edn. The house had no electricity, but did have running water. For rural Colombia, this would qualify as upper middle class, and conditions improved when they moved to Envigado, a village on the outskirts of Medell\u00edn. Hermilda, his mother, was not just a schoolteacher but a founder of Envigado's elementary school. She was an important person in the community, well-known to parents and children alike. So even as school children, Pablo and his brothers and sisters were special.</p> <p>Abel and Hermilda Escobar created a comfortable life for themselves and their seven children. But just as the prosperity of the 50s in the United States bred a restless, rebellious generation of children, so Pablo and his contemporaries in Medell\u00edn had their own way of tuning in, turning on, and dropping out.</p> <p>A hippie-like, nihilistic, countrywide youth movement called Nadaismo had its origins right in Envigado, where its founder, the intellectual Fernando Gonz\u00e1les, had written his manifesto The Right to Disobey. Banned by the church, barely tolerated by authorities, the Nadaistas - the 'nothingists' - lampooned their elders in song, dressed and behaved outrageously, and expressed their disdain for the established order in the established way of the 60s: they smoked dope.</p> <p>Pablo became a heavy doper early on and stayed that way throughout his life, sleeping until one or two in the afternoon, lighting up not long after waking up, and staying stoned for the rest of the day and night.</p> <p>He was plump and short, standing just under 5ft 6in, with a large, round face and thick, black, curly hair that he wore long, combing it left to right in a big mound that sloped across his forehead and covered his ears. He grew a wispy moustache. He looked out at the world through big, heavy-lidded hazel eyes, and cultivated the bemused boredom of the chronic doper. He dropped out of college several months before his 17th birthday, three years shy of graduation. His turn to crime appears to have been motivated as much by ennui as ambition.</p> <p>With his cousin and constant companion Gustavo Gaviria, he had taken to hanging out at a bar in a tough neighbourhood, the Jesus de Nazareno district. He told Hermilda that he wasn't cut out for school or a normal job. 'I want to be big,' he said. It was a testament to Hermilda's persistence, or possibly Pablo's broader plans, that he never fully abandoned the idea of education. He returned to college briefly two years later with Gustavo, but older than their classmates and accustomed now to the freedom and rough-and-tumble of the Medell\u00edn streets, they were considered the bullies and were soon fighting with teachers. Neither lasted the school year, although Pablo apparently tried several times, without success, to pass the tests needed to earn a diploma. He eventually just bought one. In later life, he would fill shelves in his homes with stacks of unread classics, and would talk of wanting to earn a higher degree. At one point, entering prison, he said he intended to study law. No doubt this lack of formal education continued to feed his insecurities and disappoint Hermilda, but no one who knew him doubted his natural cunning.</p> <p>He became a gangster. There was a long tradition of shady business practices in Medell\u00edn. The stereotypical paisa was a hustler, someone skilled in turning a profit no matter what the enterprise. The region was famous for contrabandistas: local heads of organised crime syndicates, practitioners of the centuries-old paisa tradition of smuggling - gold and emeralds, now marijuana and soon cocaine.</p> <p>By the time Pablo dropped out of school in 1966, drug smuggling was already serious business, well over the heads of 17-year-old hoodlums. Pablo had plans. When he told his mother that he wanted to be big, he most likely had in mind two kinds of success. Just as the contrabandistas dominated the illicit street life of Medell\u00edn, its legitimate society was ruled politically and socially by a small number of rich textile and mining industrialists and landowners. These were the dons - the men of culture and education whose money bankrolled the churches and charities and country clubs, who were feared and respected by their employees and those who rented their land. Catholic, traditional and elitist, these were the men who held high public office and went off to Bogata to represent Medell\u00edn in the national government. Pablo's ambition encompassed both worlds, licit and illicit, and they mark the central contradiction of his career.</p> <p>The legend of Pablo Escobar has it that he and his gang got their start by stealing headstones from cemeteries, sandblasting them clean and then reselling them. In later life, he was always amused when the sandblasting stories were told, and he denied them\u0085 but then, there was always much that Pablo denied. Hermilda has also called the story a lie, and indeed, it doesn't seem likely. For one thing, sandblasting sounds too much like honest labour, and there is little to suggest Pablo ever had an appetite for that. And he was deeply superstitious. He ascribed to that peculiarly pagan brand of Catholicism common in rural Antioquia, one that prays to idols and communes with dead spirits. Stealing headstones would be an unlikely avocation for anyone who feared the spirit world. What sounds more likely are stories he later admitted to, of running petty street scams with his friends, selling contraband cigarettes and fake lottery tickets, or conning people out of their cash with a mixture of bluff and charm as they emerged from the local bank.</p> <p>Maybe it was the dope, but Pablo discovered in himself an ability to remain calm, deliberate, even cheerful when others grew frightened and unsteady. He used it to impress his friends, and to frighten them. On several occasions as a youth, Pablo later boasted, he had held up Medell\u00edn banks by himself with an automatic rifle, bantering cheerfully with the clerks as they emptied their cash drawers. The record shows that Pablo was an accomplished car thief before he was 20. He and his gang took the crude business of pinching cars and turned it into a mini-industry, boldly taking vehicles (drivers would just be pulled from behind the steering wheel in broad daylight) and chopping them down to a collection of valuable parts within hours. There was plenty of money to be made in parts, and no direct evidence of the theft remained. Once he'd amassed sufficient capital, Pablo began simply bribing municipal officials to issue new papers for stolen vehicles, eliminating the need to disassemble the cars.</p> <p>It was during this period, as a young crime boss on the make, that Pablo developed a reputation for casual, lethal violence. In what may have begun as simply a method of debt collection, he would recruit thugs to kidnap people who owed him money and then ransom them for whatever was owed. If the family couldn't come up with the money or refused to pay, the victim would be killed. Sometimes the victim was killed after the ransom was paid, just to make a point.</p> <p>Kidnapping for debt collection evolved soon enough into kidnapping for its own sake. The most famous case attributed to young Pablo was that of Envigado industrialist Diego Echavarria, in the summer of 1971. He was a proud, conservative factory owner, widely respected in higher social circles but disliked by many of the poor workers in Medell\u00edn, who were being laid off in droves from local textile mills. It was a time when wealthy Antioquia landowners were expanding their country holdings by simply evicting whole villages of farmers from the Magdelena river valley, leaving them no alternative but to move to the slums of the growing city. The unpopular factory owner's body was found in a hole not far from the place where Pablo was born. He had been kidnapped six weeks earlier, and had been beaten and strangled even though his family had paid a $50,000 ransom.</p> <p>The killing of Diego Echavarria worked on two levels. It turned a profit, and doubled as a blow for social justice. There is no way to prove that Pablo orchestrated this crime, and he was never officially charged with it, but it was so widely attributed to him that in the slums people began referring to him as Doctor Echavarria, or simply El Doctor. It had all the hallmarks of the young crime boss's emerging style: cruel, deadly, smart and with an eye toward public relations.</p> <p>In one stroke, the Echavarria kidnapping elevated Pablo to the status of local legend. It also advertised his ruthlessness and ambition, which didn't hurt either. In coming years, he would become even more of a hero to many in Medell\u00edn's slums, with his well-publicised acts of charity. He had a social conscience, but his aspirations were strictly middle class. When he told his mother he wanted to be 'big', he wasn't dreaming of revolution or remaking his country - he had in mind living in a mansion as spectacular as the mock medieval castle Echavarria had built for himself. He would live in a castle like that, not as someone who exploited the masses, but as a people's don, a man of power and wealth who had not lost touch with the common man. His deepest anger was always reserved for those who interfered with that fantasy.</p> <p>Escobar was already a clever and successful crook when a seismic shift in criminal opportunity presented itself in the mid-70s: the pot generation discovered cocaine. The illicit pathways marijuana had carved from Colombia to North American cities and suburbs became expressways as coke became the fashionable drug of choice for adventurous young professionals. The cocaine business would make Pablo Escobar and his fellow Antioquia crime bosses - the Ochoa brothers, Carlos Lehder, Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez Gacha and others - richer than their wildest fantasies, and among the richest men in the world. By the end of the decade they would together control more than half of the cocaine shipped to the United States, netting a return flow of dollars measured not in millions, but billions.</p> <p>Their enterprise became the largest industry in Colombia, and bankrolled the candidacies of mayors, councilmen, congressmen and presidents. By the mid-80s Escobar would own 19 different residences in Medell\u00edn alone, each with a helipad. He owned fleets of boats and planes, properties throughout the world, housing developments, banks\u0085 there was so much money rolling in that figuring out how to invest it was more than they could handle. Many millions were simply buried. The flood of foreign cash triggered good times in Medell\u00edn. There was a boom in construction and new business start-ups, and unemployment plummeted. Eventually, the explosion of drug money knocked the entire country of Colombia off-balance, and upended the rule of law.</p> <p>Pablo had spent more than a decade building his local criminal syndicate and learning the ways of bribing officialdom. The cocaine boom initially attracted amateurs for whom cocaine was a glamorous flirtation with crime. But crime was already Pablo's element. He was violent and unprincipled and a determined climber. He wasn't an entrepreneur, and he wasn't even an especially talented businessman. He was just ruthless. When he learned about a thriving cocaine-processing lab on his turf, he shouldered his way in. If someone developed a lucrative delivery route north, Pablo demanded a majority of the profits - for protection. No one dared refuse him.</p> <p>In March 1976, Pablo married Maria Victoria Henao Vellejo, a pretty, dark-haired 15-year-old, so young that Pablo had had to obtain a special dispensation from the bishop (such things could be had for a fee). At age 26, married, wealthy, and feared, if not respected, Pablo was on his way to achieving his dreams. And the law was unable - or unwilling - to challenge him. He skated away from a drugs bust in 1976, after legal manoeuvrings and after two government agents responsible for pressing the charges were killed. Pablo was establishing a pattern of dealing with the authorities that would become his trademark. It soon became known simply as plata o plomo. One either accepted Pablo's plata (silver) or his plomo (lead).</p> <p>None of the party boys in Medell\u00edn were complaining much about Pablo's methods, because they were all getting rich. The appetite for white powder in America was seemingly inexhaustible. More money than anyone in Medell\u00edn had ever dreamed of seeing, money enough to remake not just lives but whole cities, whole nations! Between 1976 and 1980, bank deposits in Colombia's four major cities more than doubled. So many illegal American dollars were flooding into the country that the country's elite began looking for ways to score its share without breaking the law. President Alfonso L\u00f3pez Michelsen's administration permitted a practice that the central bank called 'opening a side window', which allowed unlimited quantities of dollars to be converted to Colombian pesos.</p> <p>The government also encouraged the creation of speculative funds that offered exorbitantly high interest rates. These were ostensibly legitimate investments in highly speculative markets, but nearly everyone knew that their money was really being invested in shipments of cocaine. The government played along by turning a blind eye. Soon, anyone with money to invest in Bogot\u00e1 could readily cash in on the drug bonanza. The whole nation wanted to join Pablo's party.</p> <p>With his millions, Pablo could now afford to buy protection for his cocaine shipments all through the pipeline, from growers to processors to distributors. He began travelling to Peru, Bolivia, and Panama, buying up control of the enterprise from top to bottom. He wasn't the only one. The Rodr\u00edguez Orejuela brothers, Jorge, Gilberto, and Miguel, were pulling together the threads of the Cali cocaine cartel at the same time. Competing in Antioquia - and sometimes collaborating - were Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez Gacha and the eccentric half- German Carlos Lehder. There were few law-enforcement officials inclined to resist the juggernaut - especially when one considered the alternative. All the cocaine kings had mansions, limousines, racing cars, personal helicopters, planes, fine clothes, and fancy artwork. They were surrounded by bodyguards, sycophants, and women, women, women.</p> <p>Pablo in particular was known for his adolescent appetites, though he himself rarely used cocaine and was only a moderate drinker. His recreational drug of choice remained marijuana. He and his buddies would play soccer matches under the lights on fields that he had paid to have levelled, paying announcers to call their amateur games as though they were big-time professional matches. Opponents and team-mates were always careful to make Don Pablo look good. Soon he and the other cocaine kingpins would buy the best soccer clubs in the country. To entertain his closest friends, Pablo would hire a gaggle of beauty queens for evenings of erotic games. The women would strip and race naked toward an expensive sports car, which the winner would keep, or submit to bizarre humiliations - shaving their heads, swallowing insects, or engaging in naked tree-climbing contests.</p> <p>In 1979, he constructed a lavish country estate on a 7,400-acre ranch near Puerto Triunfo on the Magdalena river, about 80 miles east of Medell\u00edn. He called it Hacienda Los N\u00e1poles. The land alone cost him $63m, and he had just started spending. He built an airport, a heliport and a network of roads. He flew in hundreds of exotic animals - elephants, buffaloes, lions, rhinoceroses, gazelles, zebras, hippos, camels, and ostriches. He built six different swimming pools and created several lakes. The mansion was outfitted with every toy and extravagance money could buy. Pablo could sleep 100 guests at a time, and entertain them with food, music, games and parties. On display out front was a 30s sedan peppered with bullet holes, which Pablo said had belonged to Bonnie and Clyde. He would take his guests on jarring trailbike excursions across his estate, or race them on jet skis across one of his custom lakes. N\u00e1poles was an outrageous blend of the erotic, exotic and extravagant. Pablo was its maestro. He enjoyed speed, sex and showing off, and he craved an audience.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/life/story/0,6903,479950,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Read the second part of Killing Pablo here</a></p>",

In coming years, he would become even more of a hero to many in Medell\u00edn's slums, with his well-publicised acts of charity. He had a social conscience, but his aspirations were strictly middle class. When he told his mother he wanted to be 'big', he wasn't dreaming of revolution or remaking his country - he had in mind living in a mansion as spectacular as the mock medieval castle Echavarria had built for himself. He would live in a castle like that, not as someone who exploited the masses, but as a people's don, a man of power and wealth who had not lost touch with the common man. His deepest anger was always reserved for those who interfered with that fantasy. Escobar was already a clever and successful crook when a seismic shift in criminal opportunity presented itself in the mid-70s: the pot generation discovered cocaine. The illicit pathways marijuana had carved from Colombia to North American cities and suburbs became expressways as coke became the fashionable drug of choice for adventurous young professionals. The cocaine business would make Pablo Escobar and his fellow Antioquia crime bosses - the Ochoa brothers, Carlos Lehder, Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez Gacha and others - richer than their wildest fantasies, and among the richest men in the world. By the end of the decade they would together control more than half of the cocaine shipped to the United States, netting a return flow of dollars measured not in millions, but billions. Their enterprise became the largest industry in Colombia, and bankrolled the candidacies of mayors, councilmen, congressmen and presidents. By the mid-80s Escobar would own 19 different residences in Medell\u00edn alone, each with a helipad. He owned fleets of boats and planes, properties throughout the world, housing developments, banks\u0085 there was so much money rolling in that figuring out how to invest it was more than they could handle. Many millions were simply buried. The flood of foreign cash triggered good times in Medell\u00edn. There was a boom in construction and new business start-ups, and unemployment plummeted. Eventually, the explosion of drug money knocked the entire country of Colombia off-balance, and upended the rule of law. Pablo had spent more than a decade building his local criminal syndicate and learning the ways of bribing officialdom. The cocaine boom initially attracted amateurs for whom cocaine was a glamorous flirtation with crime. But crime was already Pablo's element. He was violent and unprincipled and a determined climber. He wasn't an entrepreneur, and he wasn't even an especially talented businessman. He was just ruthless. When he learned about a thriving cocaine-processing lab on his turf, he shouldered his way in. If someone developed a lucrative delivery route north, Pablo demanded a majority of the profits - for protection. No one dared refuse him. In March 1976, Pablo married Maria Victoria Henao Vellejo, a pretty, dark-haired 15-year-old, so young that Pablo had had to obtain a special dispensation from the bishop (such things could be had for a fee). At age 26, married, wealthy, and feared, if not respected, Pablo was on his way to achieving his dreams. And the law was unable - or unwilling - to challenge him. He skated away from a drugs bust in 1976, after legal manoeuvrings and after two government agents responsible for pressing the charges were killed. Pablo was establishing a pattern of dealing with the authorities that would become his trademark. It soon became known simply as plata o plomo. One either accepted Pablo's plata (silver) or his plomo (lead). None of the party boys in Medell\u00edn were complaining much about Pablo's methods, because they were all getting rich. The appetite for white powder in America was seemingly inexhaustible. More money than anyone in Medell\u00edn had ever dreamed of seeing, money enough to remake not just lives but whole cities, whole nations! Between 1976 and 1980, bank deposits in Colombia's four major cities more than doubled. So many illegal American dollars were flooding into the country that the country's elite began looking for ways to score its share without breaking the law. President Alfonso L\u00f3pez Michelsen's administration permitted a practice that the central bank called 'opening a side window', which allowed unlimited quantities of dollars to be converted to Colombian pesos. The government also encouraged the creation of speculative funds that offered exorbitantly high interest rates. These were ostensibly legitimate investments in highly speculative markets, but nearly everyone knew that their money was really being invested in shipments of cocaine. The government played along by turning a blind eye. Soon, anyone with money to invest in Bogot\u00e1 could readily cash in on the drug bonanza. The whole nation wanted to join Pablo's party. With his millions, Pablo could now afford to buy protection for his cocaine shipments all through the pipeline, from growers to processors to distributors. He began travelling to Peru, Bolivia, and Panama, buying up control of the enterprise from top to bottom. He wasn't the only one. The Rodr\u00edguez Orejuela brothers, Jorge, Gilberto, and Miguel, were pulling together the threads of the Cali cocaine cartel at the same time. Competing in Antioquia - and sometimes collaborating - were Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez Gacha and the eccentric half- German Carlos Lehder. There were few law-enforcement officials inclined to resist the juggernaut - especially when one considered the alternative. All the cocaine kings had mansions, limousines, racing cars, personal helicopters, planes, fine clothes, and fancy artwork. They were surrounded by bodyguards, sycophants, and women, women, women. Pablo in particular was known for his adolescent appetites, though he himself rarely used cocaine and was only a moderate drinker. His recreational drug of choice remained marijuana. He and his buddies would play soccer matches under the lights on fields that he had paid to have levelled, paying announcers to call their amateur games as though they were big-time professional matches. Opponents and team-mates were always careful to make Don Pablo look good. Soon he and the other cocaine kingpins would buy the best soccer clubs in the country. To entertain his closest friends, Pablo would hire a gaggle of beauty queens for evenings of erotic games. The women would strip and race naked toward an expensive sports car, which the winner would keep, or submit to bizarre humiliations - shaving their heads, swallowing insects, or engaging in naked tree-climbing contests. In 1979, he constructed a lavish country estate on a 7,400-acre ranch near Puerto Triunfo on the Magdalena river, about 80 miles east of Medell\u00edn. He called it Hacienda Los N\u00e1poles. The land alone cost him $63m, and he had just started spending. He built an airport, a heliport and a network of roads. He flew in hundreds of exotic animals - elephants, buffaloes, lions, rhinoceroses, gazelles, zebras, hippos, camels, and ostriches. He built six different swimming pools and created several lakes. The mansion was outfitted with every toy and extravagance money could buy. Pablo could sleep 100 guests at a time, and entertain them with food, music, games and parties. On display out front was a 30s sedan peppered with bullet holes, which Pablo said had belonged to Bonnie and Clyde. He would take his guests on jarring trailbike excursions across his estate, or race them on jet skis across one of his custom lakes. N\u00e1poles was an outrageous blend of the erotic, exotic and extravagant. Pablo was its maestro. He enjoyed speed, sex and showing off, and he craved an audience.

      "body": "<p>Vincent Furnier, who started performing as the megalomaniac rock god Alice Cooper three decades ago, still looks more or less the same - he is long-haired, big-nosed, Cuban-heeled, with thin, pipe-cleaner legs. He is 53. He's recorded 25 albums, spent years as an alcoholic, dried out, converted to Christianity, taken up golf, opened a restaurant with a sporting theme in his home town of Phoenix, Arizona, and raised three children. Some things in his life have remained consistent - he still watches a kung-fu movie before every stage performance and eats a McDonald's quarter pounder with cheese afterwards. We meet in a hotel lobby in Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia, as he embarks on his umpteenth world tour.</p> <p>We are ushered into a car which will take Furnier to a local radio station. Settling into his seat, he says, 'They just point me.' Tobey Mamis, second-in-command of Furnier's managerial team, has told me that 'Alice' is extremely professional and good with the media. He comes to life in front of a microphone. In the car, Furnier says, 'You know what? This royal scandal is pretty ridiculous. Did she say anything scandalous? If it was me, I'd have told them I was a cannibal.' Looking out of the window at the dull sky, he says, 'I don't think I can quite get away with sunglasses. It's just a bit too cloudy.'</p> <p>Offstage, but in public, he negotiates the territory between the real Vincent Furnier, a middle-aged entertainer, and his stage persona, Alice Cooper, who is supposed to represent the evil that exists in the human condition. There are similarities between the two - for instance, both Furnier and Alice believe in Satan. But while Alice kills babies, Furnier attends weekly Bible classes. Furnier spends five days a week on the golf course. He has a handicap of four. At the moment, though, he is on Alice-related business, and expects to be addressed as such. Arriving at the studio, he sits in front of the microphone, grinning. The presenter, a cheery woman, says, 'Most of you probably know him for his gothic stage persona. But did you know that he's a very keen golfer? Welcome, Alice Cooper.'</p> <p>Alice Cooper! This is the man who pranced around on stage in a corset and leopard-print thigh boots, a live boa constrictor around his neck, who cut the heads off dolls filled with fake blood, who declared, 'An audience loves to be taken and almost raped.' This is the man who threw handfuls of dollar bills at his fans and stood above them, relishing the ensuing mayhem, who pretended to have himself guillotined at every one of his shows, who was condemned by the MP Leo Abse for 'peddling the culture of the concentration camp', and whose records were banned in the early 70s after a campaign by Mary Whitehouse. When Johnny Rotten auditioned for the Sex Pistols, he mimed to Cooper's song 'Eighteen'. Once, during a 1969 Alice Cooper show in Toronto, a member of the audience threw a live hen on stage; Cooper, thinking it would be able to fly, threw it back. The audience tore it to pieces.</p> <p>And what did it all mean? Alice Cooper was the Eminem, or the Beastie Boys, of his day. He was trying to show us what we, as a society, had come to. 'Society has created this Frankenstein, this Alice Cooper,' he said in 1973. One critic, Allan Jones, made the point that Alice was not Alice Cooper, but 'the audience was'. Even though it all got too much for him in the late 70s, when he used to drink more than a bottle of whiskey a day, Vincent Furnier has often referred to himself as 'the ultimate put-on'. He is a conservative Christian. As long ago as 30 years ago, he declared, 'I'm the most American rock act. I have American ideals. I love money.'</p> <p>You wonder what drives him still. He doesn't need the money. He has just flown thousands of miles, been subjected to delays and stopovers, and is visibly weary. Perking up on air, he says, 'I didn't know that rock'n'roll was such a long-lasting disease. There's a guitar germ or something. When I was a little kid, and I heard the electric guitar for the first time, it got in my system. Chuck Berry or whatever. To this day, all of my albums are guitar-driven rock'n'roll. The only thing that won't go away is garage rock. The Rolling Stones are the best garage band of all time. Two guitars, bass, drums, and a lead singer. That's garage rock. Aerosmith. AC/DC. Alice. Led Zeppelin. These are all great garage bands.' He's a fluent speaker. 'If I wasn't doing this,' he says, 'I would have loved to have been a lightweight boxer.' </p> <p>He took up golf, he says, to take his mind off drinking. He talks readily about his drinking years. 'Let me tell you who my big brothers were. Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, Keith Moon, Harry Nilsson. These people were my best friends. I was the little kid - the one on the way up. Every one of these guys were like maniacs. Look who I was looking up to. The thing I did learn is that you don't have to die. I learned a long time ago that Alice Cooper had to have his own life. Tomorrow night, onstage, it'll be fun to be Alice for two hours. But I don't have to be Alice now. Jim Morrison thought he had to be Jim Morrison all the time.' </p> <p>Fans are gathering. Alice poses for snaps. \u00ba \u00aa He says, 'I've got to do a dress rehearsal - in a real dress!' The Australians love him. The first time he came here, he says, was in 1976. In Perth, in his hotel room, he woke to the sounds of what he thought were fans shouting 'Alice! Alice!' Preparing to bathe in the adulation, he opened the window. What they were really shouting, he says, was 'Abba! Abba!'</p> <p>In the car, he tells me about his family. His wife Sheryl is a former ballet dancer who took a job on the side performing in his stage show. She played the part of the nurse and also the leather-clad dominatrix who attacks, and is attacked by, Alice on stage. These parts are now played by Calico Furnier, Alice and Sheryl's 19-year-old daughter. He has a 16-year-old son, Dashiell, and an eight-year-old daughter, Sonora. 'My son loves hockey, heavy metal and so on,' he says. 'So I go into his room, and he's watching a Britney Spears video. Him and his buddies are all sitting there. Normally they're all listening to this hell-raising music. I said, \"You guys like this?\" He said, \"Dad, look at her.\" I went: \"Right!\"' Alice clenches his fist. 'As a father,' he says, 'I thought, \"I have a son!\"'</p> <p>Britney Spears is on Alice's mind for another reason - he has devised a Britney routine for his new show. In the routine, Calico dresses up as Britney, in a shortie kilt, and gets into a fight with Alice. We talk about Britney's celebrated virginity and the fact that, a decade ago, Brooke Shields worked the same ploy. 'What guy in the world doesn't like that image?' he says. '\"This is my butt. Nobody's touched it.\" Every guy in America is saying: \"Let me be the first!\"'</p> <p>Back at the hotel, Alice's manager Shep Gordon, who was introduced to him in 1969 by Jimi Hendrix, is discussing Alice's golf options with a local professional called Clem. There is a course nearby. On the other hand, the weather is bad; we are experiencing the tail end of a cyclone off the Gold Coast. Gordon, who used to wear flowers in his hair, is now bald, but has a tanned pate. He lives in Hawaii. He says, 'I think Alice has been a remarkable reflection of an adolescent's feelings about the world Like all great artists, he's a reflection of the times.'</p> <p>As times have changed, so Alice's act has changed - it has become more doomy. The show he is preparing has the same name as his most recent album: Brutal Planet. 'The world is a different place,' says Gordon. 'Thirty years ago it was about throwing water balloons in the summer recess. Now it's about bringing a gun to the school and killing everybody. A song like \"School's Out\" becomes very trite, almost. Whereas 30 years ago, it was revolutionary.' Gordon says, 'It is a brutal planet. It's one of the reasons I live in Hawaii.'</p> <p>Here in Newcastle, the surf is pounding on the beach. Wind is buffeting the windows. Upstairs in his hotel suite, Alice is wearing slippers, having removed his snakeskin boots, and is sitting with his feet up, watching golf on TV. When I arrive, he flicks the remote and starts watching a recording of the Grammy awards. 'There's so little rock involved,' he says. 'It's all about what's easy to listen to. Now, rap has made a place. Rap is basically the voice of the street. But when you look at the rock charts and see Destiny's Child, and Ricky Martin I like Ricky Martin, but I take exception when they say, \"It's all rock'n'roll.\" It's not rock'n'roll. Rock'n'roll is Aerosmith. Rock'n'roll is AC/DC. Rock'n'roll is The Offspring.'</p> <p>Alice grew up in Detroit, but the family moved to Phoenix when he was 10, hoping the dry climate would have a beneficial effect on the young Vincent's asthma. It did. His father, Mickey, was a car dealer and then an electronic engineer who preached in his spare time, as his own father had done. Alice says he is part French, part Sioux. 'So maybe that's where my drinking problem came from. You can probably trace me back to Creole. There's a little bit of hillbilly in there, too. But when I look at myself, the high cheekbones and the black hair, there's some Indian in me, I can tell.'</p> <p>As a kid, although never particularly musical, he liked to dress up as Elvis Presley. At Cortez High School, his first band was called The Earwigs. 'It wasn't a band,' his older sister Nickie would tell reporters, 'it was a joke.' He was a marathon runner, and he formed The Earwigs with Dennis Dunaway, another runner, for a school revue. Along with 'the early days of being in the band', Alice tells me that his schooldays were the best time of his life. 'I basically ran my school. I had all my teachers totally under my spell. I was funny. Popular. I was a jock. I had the only band in school. I got along with every sect at high school. I was sort of the go-to guy. If somebody wanted to meet a girl, they'd say, \"We'll call Vince. Vince'll introduce you.\"'</p> <p>Before he decided on the name Alice Cooper, the band was called Nazz, and then The Spiders. 'I had such a great time with my original band,' he tells me. 'The only thing we had going for us was that we believed in this silly rock'n'roll that we were doing - and the theatrics.' For a time they all lived together in a mansion in Greenwich, Connecticut. 'We weren't what people imagined,' he says. 'People assumed we were into drugs, but we were drinkers. People might have thought we were liberal, but we were conservative. We called ourselves Alice Cooper, but we were probably the biggest chauvinist pigs out there.'</p> <p>After having massive hits with the albums School's Out and Billion Dollar Babies, the band split up in 1975. 'They wanted to ditch the theatrics,' Alice tells me. 'One guy wanted to be George Harrison; one wanted to be Pink Floyd. I was going, \"Guys, we won the war. We won. Everybody wants to be us now. You want to go backwards?\" I was thinking just the opposite. Instead of having less theatrics, I was thinking five times more.'</p> <p>Since then, working with a fluctuating line-up, Alice has become increasingly theatrical. The first big show was called Welcome to My Nightmare. 'This was guitar killer-monster rock with real theatrics. With spiders coming up out of the floor! There was a bed that came out, and monsters came out from under the bed and did ballet! If you're going to say \"Welcome to My Nightmare\", do it. If you're going to say \"Brutal Planet\", you'd better give them Brutal Planet.'</p> <p>We drive to the venue for the dress rehearsal. The stage set is already in place - a guillotine, a crashed car, piles of tyres and rusty pieces of machinery. Brutal Planet is set in a futuristic, Mad Max-like dystopia. In the dressing room, which contains a lifelike rotting corpse, a television crew from Channel 10 is setting up cameras for an interview. Alice sits on the sofa, in a sea of skulls. On camera, he says, 'The show is very apocalyptic and dark. One song, \"Wicked Young Man\", is about Columbine.' The interviewer says, 'Certain sections of the community blame music for these tragedies.'</p> <p>'You know, it's so ridiculous,' replies Alice. 'What rock album was Hitler listening to? He was listening to Wagner when he was killing everybody.'</p> <p>The rehearsal begins. As the guitars start to crunch, Alice moves about the stage, a hopped-up, skinny presence, a dervish with wild hair. He practises walking around the stage, posing with a crutch. He practises holding out his mike towards the auditorium to encourage the audience to sing. He sings, 'I've gotta get outta here/Mum and Dad have got me drinking whiskey/I'm 18 and I like it.' He looks like a timeless old pirate. Age has not withered the Alice Cooper persona, but improved it. The more hollow-eyed and wrinkled he looks, the better. He struts around between the guitarists, playing air guitar. 'The breath of the death is the only sound,' he whispers into the microphone.</p> <p>More practising. The stunts must be organised. Calico, dressed as a nurse, runs on to the stage. Alice practises abducting Calico and shutting her in the boot of the wrecked car. Later, she bursts out of the boot. There are more scuffles. Alice rehearses sticking a curved sword into a plastic baby, and then waving the baby above his head. He is then arrested and guillotined on stage. As he disappears behind the guillotine, his head is substituted for a rubber lookalike. Later, Calico appears as Britney and mimes the words, 'Hit me one more time', at which point Alice does. On the way back to the hotel, Alice says, 'My old body feels like I walked from California.' There is silence for a while. Then he says, 'Look at the size of that!' We are approaching a large building, festooned at every entrance with golden arches.</p> <p>It is Friday the 13th of April, Good Friday, the day of the show itself. In the hotel, Alice tells me about Christianity, which he began to take seriously 10 years ago. 'It's everything,' he says. 'It's what I live for. If you gave me a choice between rock'n'roll and my faith, I'd take my faith. Rock'n'roll is fun - it's what I do for a living. But it's not what I live on. I believe in classic Christianity. I've given my whole life to the Lord. But I don't think that means you can't be a rock'n'roller. Ten years ago I went to my pastor and said, \"I can't be Alice Cooper any more.\" He said, \"D'you think God makes mistakes?\"'</p> <p>He is religious, he says, having indulged in every pleasure it is possible to indulge in, and having, at the end of it, still felt empty. 'If you had known me 20 years ago, you would have said, \"This is the most crazed, addicted person on the planet.\"' Drinking, he says, is 'a real freedom in the head. And I lived behind that mask for an awful long time.'</p> <p>Alice drank with Keith Moon, who was 'such a loon. You had to love him. Of course, you had to sit with him and drink all night. Same with Harry Nilsson. Same with John Lennon. John liked to drink.' Others involved were Mickey Dolenz, of the Monkees, Bernie Taupin, John Belushi. 'You'd get on the same level and everyone was having a great time. </p> <p>'I've had every car, every mansion,' says Alice. 'I went through everything you could do.' Of his experience with drugs, he says, 'You lived through the 60s and 70s. You tried this and that.' He says he hasn't cheated on his wife since they got together a quarter of a century ago. Of being debauched, he says, 'I got to the end and realised there was nothing out there. I was still hungry for something. I was the prodigal son. I left the house, achieved fame and fortune, and found out that that was not what I wanted. Now I read the Bible every day. I pray every day. That's really what I'm about.'</p> <p>Is he, in a way, a sort of preacher, carrying on the tradition of his father and grandfather? 'Sometimes,' he says, 'I think what I do on stage is a very dramatic warning to the audience that Satan is not a myth. I believe he's very active.'</p> <p>Calico is sitting at the hotel bar. She wants to be an actress. When she told her father this, he told her to practise saying the phrase, '\"Do ya want that wit' cheese?\" Cos that's what you're going to be doing.' Of the show, she says, 'Your jaw is going to drop to the floor.' She feels fully rehearsed, and is not worried about getting hurt in the scene where she has a fight with her father. Alice appears to punch her in the face. 'Sometimes you just get clocked,' she says. 'But it is stage fighting. It's hit and push. You push your hand back if you make any contact.' She ponders for a while, and says, 'It's Spinal Tap, the show. We're just waiting for Stonehenge to drop.'</p> <p>Half an hour before the show is due to begin, I walk into Alice's dressing room. He is watching a kung-fu movie. Chinese men are tumbling around, shouting. He's calm. Alice says, 'You didn't believe me, did you?' He opens a trunk, which is full of kung-fu videos. The door opens. It is Brian Nelson, known among the entourage as Renfield. Nelson, originally a fan, had spent years attending every Alice Cooper show within driving distance of his home in Buffalo; before he was hired as Alice's assistant, he had become an Alice authority, with a huge collection of memorabilia. He knows more about Alice than anybody on earth, possibly Alice himself. He says to me, 'What are you doing? Alice needs to be alone now.'</p> <p>Nelson ushers me to the door. Alice nods. Outside, in the corridor, Nelson says, 'You shouldn't have done that! This is when Alice watches his kung-fu movies!'</p> <p>The show begins with a sinister voice: 'Well, well, well - what have we here? I am the controller of the city of the dead run by the sadistic megalomaniac Alice Cooper. Go now while you have a chance before it's too late. If he catches me now, he'll kill me if I'm lucky!'</p> <p>And then everything happens - the Mad Max costumes, the dry ice, the raw guitar chords. Eric Dober, the rhythm guitarist, had told me he was nervous; this was his first performance in the band. Alice had told Dober to make his playing as raw as feasibly possible, to 'make that guitar just a horrible thing'. And now Dober is bucking over his guitar, squeezing a suitably hellish noise from it.</p> <p>The show runs smoothly. The Newcastle fans seem to be either young or fairly old - a good proportion are well into middle age. One kid has the word 'Twisted' inked across his face. 'I'm Twisted Boy,' he tells me. Adults, I think, like Alice because he reminds them of the time when they used to say that the world was going to hell in a handcart, but did not really believe it. Kids see him as another point on the hellish cartography that is their cultural world. Alice stabs the baby; Alice shuts his daughter in the boot of the car. The guillotine scene works well. Alice croaks out his Aids-era song, 'Poison' ('You're poison, running through my veins'). When he sings 'School's Out', lots of people stand up and start bopping around. Towards the end, he disappears and comes back wearing a T-shirt which says 'Britney Wants Me' on the front, and 'Dead' on the back. Calico appears, dressed as Britney. They fight.</p> <p>After the show, Alice has agreed to 'meet and greet' some competition winners and members of a local golf organisation. 'Say please and thank you,' says one man to his son. One man, a collector of Alice memorabilia, asks Brian Nelson to sign something. In the car afterwards, Alice sings 'There's no business like show business' in a jaunty manner. We drive through the windy streets of Newcastle towards the golden arches. 'We should do a commercial for these guys,' says Alice. Then he says, 'At least I'm always thinking. I've always got an angle. I'm an ideas man.' </p> <p>But when we get to McDonald's, there is a huge tailback. The queue has been caused by Alice Cooper fans, who left the venue before us. 'I'll have a quarter pounder with cheese,' says Alice. And we join the end of the queue.</p> <p>\u0095 Alice Cooper tours the UK from 15 to 21 May. For ticket information, call 0115 912 9129.</p>",

If it was me, I'd have told them I was a cannibal.' Looking out of the window at the dull sky, he says, 'I don't think I can quite get away with sunglasses. It's just a bit too cloudy.' Offstage, but in public, he negotiates the territory between the real Vincent Furnier, a middle-aged entertainer, and his stage persona, Alice Cooper, who is supposed to represent the evil that exists in the human condition. There are similarities between the two - for instance, both Furnier and Alice believe in Satan. But while Alice kills babies, Furnier attends weekly Bible classes. Furnier spends five days a week on the golf course. He has a handicap of four. At the moment, though, he is on Alice-related business, and expects to be addressed as such. Arriving at the studio, he sits in front of the microphone, grinning. The presenter, a cheery woman, says, 'Most of you probably know him for his gothic stage persona. But did you know that he's a very keen golfer? Welcome, Alice Cooper.' Alice Cooper! This is the man who pranced around on stage in a corset and leopard-print thigh boots, a live boa constrictor around his neck, who cut the heads off dolls filled with fake blood, who declared, 'An audience loves to be taken and almost raped.' This is the man who threw handfuls of dollar bills at his fans and stood above them, relishing the ensuing mayhem, who pretended to have himself guillotined at every one of his shows, who was condemned by the MP Leo Abse for 'peddling the culture of the concentration camp', and whose records were banned in the early 70s after a campaign by Mary Whitehouse. When Johnny Rotten auditioned for the Sex Pistols, he mimed to Cooper's song 'Eighteen'. Once, during a 1969 Alice Cooper show in Toronto, a member of the audience threw a live hen on stage; Cooper, thinking it would be able to fly, threw it back. The audience tore it to pieces. And what did it all mean? Alice Cooper was the Eminem, or the Beastie Boys, of his day. He was trying to show us what we, as a society, had come to. 'Society has created this Frankenstein, this Alice Cooper,' he said in 1973. One critic, Allan Jones, made the point that Alice was not Alice Cooper, but 'the audience was'. Even though it all got too much for him in the late 70s, when he used to drink more than a bottle of whiskey a day, Vincent Furnier has often referred to himself as 'the ultimate put-on'. He is a conservative Christian. As long ago as 30 years ago, he declared, 'I'm the most American rock act. I have American ideals. I love money.' You wonder what drives him still. He doesn't need the money. He has just flown thousands of miles, been subjected to delays and stopovers, and is visibly weary. Perking up on air, he says, 'I didn't know that rock'n'roll was such a long-lasting disease. There's a guitar germ or something. When I was a little kid, and I heard the electric guitar for the first time, it got in my system. Chuck Berry or whatever. To this day, all of my albums are guitar-driven rock'n'roll. The only thing that won't go away is garage rock. The Rolling Stones are the best garage band of all time. Two guitars, bass, drums, and a lead singer. That's garage rock. Aerosmith. AC/DC. Alice. Led Zeppelin. These are all great garage bands.' He's a fluent speaker. 'If I wasn't doing this,' he says, 'I would have loved to have been a lightweight boxer.' He took up golf, he says, to take his mind off drinking. He talks readily about his drinking years. 'Let me tell you who my big brothers were. Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, Keith Moon, Harry Nilsson. These people were my best friends. I was the little kid - the one on the way up. Every one of these guys were like maniacs. Look who I was looking up to. The thing I did learn is that you don't have to die. I learned a long time ago that Alice Cooper had to have his own life. Tomorrow night, onstage, it'll be fun to be Alice for two hours. But I don't have to be Alice now. Jim Morrison thought he had to be Jim Morrison all the time.' Fans are gathering. Alice poses for snaps. \u00ba \u00aa He says, 'I've got to do a dress rehearsal - in a real dress!' The Australians love him. The first time he came here, he says, was in 1976. In Perth, in his hotel room, he woke to the sounds of what he thought were fans shouting 'Alice! Alice!' Preparing to bathe in the adulation, he opened the window. What they were really shouting, he says, was 'Abba! Abba!' In the car, he tells me about his family. His wife Sheryl is a former ballet dancer who took a job on the side performing in his stage show. She played the part of the nurse and also the leather-clad dominatrix who attacks, and is attacked by, Alice on stage. These parts are now played by Calico Furnier, Alice and Sheryl's 19-year-old daughter. He has a 16-year-old son, Dashiell, and an eight-year-old daughter, Sonora. 'My son loves hockey, heavy metal and so on,' he says. 'So I go into his room, and he's watching a Britney Spears video. Him and his buddies are all sitting there. Normally they're all listening to this hell-raising music. I said, \"You guys like this?\" He said, \"Dad, look at her.\" I went: \"Right!\"' Alice clenches his fist. 'As a father,' he says, 'I thought, \"I have a son!\"' Britney Spears is on Alice's mind for another reason - he has devised a Britney routine for his new show. In the routine, Calico dresses up as Britney, in a shortie kilt, and gets into a fight with Alice. We talk about Britney's celebrated virginity and the fact that, a decade ago, Brooke Shields worked the same ploy. 'What guy in the world doesn't like that image?' he says. '\"This is my butt. Nobody's touched it.\" Every guy in America is saying: \"Let me be the first!\"' Back at the hotel, Alice's manager Shep Gordon, who was introduced to him in 1969 by Jimi Hendrix, is discussing Alice's golf options with a local professional called Clem. There is a course nearby. On the other hand, the weather is bad; we are experiencing the tail end of a cyclone off the Gold Coast. Gordon, who used to wear flowers in his hair, is now bald, but has a tanned pate. He lives in Hawaii. He says, 'I think Alice has been a remarkable reflection of an adolescent's feelings about the world Like all great artists, he's a reflection of the times.' As times have changed, so Alice's act has changed - it has become more doomy. The show he is preparing has the same name as his most recent album: Brutal Planet. 'The world is a different place,' says Gordon. 'Thirty years ago it was about throwing water balloons in the summer recess. Now it's about bringing a gun to the school and killing everybody. A song like \"School's Out\" becomes very trite, almost. Whereas 30 years ago, it was revolutionary.' Gordon says, 'It is a brutal planet. It's one of the reasons I live in Hawaii.' Here in Newcastle, the surf is pounding on the beach. Wind is buffeting the windows. Upstairs in his hotel suite, Alice is wearing slippers, having removed his snakeskin boots, and is sitting with his feet up, watching golf on TV. When I arrive, he flicks the remote and starts watching a recording of the Grammy awards. 'There's so little rock involved,' he says. 'It's all about what's easy to listen to. Now, rap has made a place. Rap is basically the voice of the street. But when you look at the rock charts and see Destiny's Child, and Ricky Martin I like Ricky Martin, but I take exception when they say, \"It's all rock'n'roll.\" It's not rock'n'roll. Rock'n'roll is Aerosmith. Rock'n'roll is AC/DC. Rock'n'roll is The Offspring.' Alice grew up in Detroit, but the family moved to Phoenix when he was 10, hoping the dry climate would have a beneficial effect on the young Vincent's asthma. It did. His father, Mickey, was a car dealer and then an electronic engineer who preached in his spare time, as his own father had done. Alice says he is part French, part Sioux. 'So maybe that's where my drinking problem came from. You can probably trace me back to Creole. There's a little bit of hillbilly in there, too. But when I look at myself, the high cheekbones and the black hair, there's some Indian in me, I can tell.' As a kid, although never particularly musical, he liked to dress up as Elvis Presley. At Cortez High School, his first band was called The Earwigs. 'It wasn't a band,' his older sister Nickie would tell reporters, 'it was a joke.' He was a marathon runner, and he formed The Earwigs with Dennis Dunaway, another runner, for a school revue. Along with 'the early days of being in the band', Alice tells me that his schooldays were the best time of his life. 'I basically ran my school. I had all my teachers totally under my spell. I was funny. Popular. I was a jock. I had the only band in school. I got along with every sect at high school. I was sort of the go-to guy. If somebody wanted to meet a girl, they'd say, \"We'll call Vince. Vince'll introduce you.\"' Before he decided on the name Alice Cooper, the band was called Nazz, and then The Spiders. 'I had such a great time with my original band,' he tells me. 'The only thing we had going for us was that we believed in this silly rock'n'roll that we were doing - and the theatrics.' For a time they all lived together in a mansion in Greenwich, Connecticut. 'We weren't what people imagined,' he says. 'People assumed we were into drugs, but we were drinkers. People might have thought we were liberal, but we were conservative. We called ourselves Alice Cooper, but we were probably the biggest chauvinist pigs out there.' After having massive hits with the albums School's Out and Billion Dollar Babies, the band split up in 1975. 'They wanted to ditch the theatrics,' Alice tells me. 'One guy wanted to be George Harrison; one wanted to be Pink Floyd. I was going, \"Guys, we won the war. We won. Everybody wants to be us now. You want to go backwards?\" I was thinking just the opposite. Instead of having less theatrics, I was thinking five times more.' Since then, working with a fluctuating line-up, Alice has become increasingly theatrical. The first big show was called Welcome to My Nightmare. 'This was guitar killer-monster rock with real theatrics. With spiders coming up out of the floor! There was a bed that came out, and monsters came out from under the bed and did ballet! If you're going to say \"Welcome to My Nightmare\", do it. If you're going to say \"Brutal Planet\", you'd better give them Brutal Planet.' We drive to the venue for the dress rehearsal. The stage set is already in place - a guillotine, a crashed car, piles of tyres and rusty pieces of machinery. Brutal Planet is set in a futuristic, Mad Max-like dystopia. In the dressing room, which contains a lifelike rotting corpse, a television crew from Channel 10 is setting up cameras for an interview. Alice sits on the sofa, in a sea of skulls. On camera, he says, 'The show is very apocalyptic and dark. One song, \"Wicked Young Man\", is about Columbine.' The interviewer says, 'Certain sections of the community blame music for these tragedies.' 'You know, it's so ridiculous,' replies Alice. 'What rock album was Hitler listening to? He was listening to Wagner when he was killing everybody.' The rehearsal begins. As the guitars start to crunch, Alice moves about the stage, a hopped-up, skinny presence, a dervish with wild hair. He practises walking around the stage, posing with a crutch. He practises holding out his mike towards the auditorium to encourage the audience to sing. He sings, 'I've gotta get outta here/Mum and Dad have got me drinking whiskey/I'm 18 and I like it.' He looks like a timeless old pirate. Age has not withered the Alice Cooper persona, but improved it. The more hollow-eyed and wrinkled he looks, the better. He struts around between the guitarists, playing air guitar. 'The breath of the death is the only sound,' he whispers into the microphone. More practising. The stunts must be organised. Calico, dressed as a nurse, runs on to the stage. Alice practises abducting Calico and shutting her in the boot of the wrecked car. Later, she bursts out of the boot. There are more scuffles. Alice rehearses sticking a curved sword into a plastic baby, and then waving the baby above his head. He is then arrested and guillotined on stage. As he disappears behind the guillotine, his head is substituted for a rubber lookalike. Later, Calico appears as Britney and mimes the words, 'Hit me one more time', at which point Alice does. On the way back to the hotel, Alice says, 'My old body feels like I walked from California.' There is silence for a while. Then he says, 'Look at the size of that!' We are approaching a large building, festooned at every entrance with golden arches. It is Friday the 13th of April, Good Friday, the day of the show itself. In the hotel, Alice tells me about Christianity, which he began to take seriously 10 years ago. 'It's everything,' he says. 'It's what I live for. If you gave me a choice between rock'n'roll and my faith, I'd take my faith. Rock'n'roll is fun - it's what I do for a living. But it's not what I live on. I believe in classic Christianity. I've given my whole life to the Lord. But I don't think that means you can't be a rock'n'roller. Ten years ago I went to my pastor and said, \"I can't be Alice Cooper any more.\" He said, \"D'you think God makes mistakes?\"' He is religious, he says, having indulged in every pleasure it is possible to indulge in, and having, at the end of it, still felt empty. 'If you had known me 20 years ago, you would have said, \"This is the most crazed, addicted person on the planet.\"' Drinking, he says, is 'a real freedom in the head. And I lived behind that mask for an awful long time.' Alice drank with Keith Moon, who was 'such a loon. You had to love him. Of course, you had to sit with him and drink all night. Same with Harry Nilsson. Same with John Lennon. John liked to drink.' Others involved were Mickey Dolenz, of the Monkees, Bernie Taupin, John Belushi. 'You'd get on the same level and everyone was having a great time. 'I've had every car, every mansion,' says Alice. 'I went through everything you could do.' Of his experience with drugs, he says, 'You lived through the 60s and 70s. You tried this and that.' He says he hasn't cheated on his wife since they got together a quarter of a century ago. Of being debauched, he says, 'I got to the end and realised there was nothing out there. I was still hungry for something. I was the prodigal son. I left the house, achieved fame and fortune, and found out that that was not what I wanted. Now I read the Bible every day. I pray every day. That's really what I'm about.' Is he, in a way, a sort of preacher, carrying on the tradition of his father and grandfather? 'Sometimes,' he says, 'I think what I do on stage is a very dramatic warning to the audience that Satan is not a myth. I believe he's very active.' Calico is sitting at the hotel bar. She wants to be an actress. When she told her father this, he told her to practise saying the phrase, '\"Do ya want that wit' cheese?\" Cos that's what you're going to be doing.' Of the show, she says, 'Your jaw is going to drop to the floor.' She feels fully rehearsed, and is not worried about getting hurt in the scene where she has a fight with her father. Alice appears to punch her in the face. 'Sometimes you just get clocked,' she says. 'But it is stage fighting. It's hit and push. You push your hand back if you make any contact.' She ponders for a while, and says, 'It's Spinal Tap, the show. We're just waiting for Stonehenge to drop.' Half an hour before the show is due to begin, I walk into Alice's dressing room. He is watching a kung-fu movie. Chinese men are tumbling around, shouting. He's calm. Alice says, 'You didn't believe me, did you?' He opens a trunk, which is full of kung-fu videos. The door opens. It is Brian Nelson, known among the entourage as Renfield. Nelson, originally a fan, had spent years attending every Alice Cooper show within driving distance of his home in Buffalo; before he was hired as Alice's assistant, he had become an Alice authority, with a huge collection of memorabilia. He knows more about Alice than anybody on earth, possibly Alice himself. He says to me, 'What are you doing? Alice needs to be alone now.' Nelson ushers me to the door. Alice nods. Outside, in the corridor, Nelson says, 'You shouldn't have done that! This is when Alice watches his kung-fu movies!' The show begins with a sinister voice: 'Well, well, well - what have we here? I am the controller of the city of the dead run by the sadistic megalomaniac Alice Cooper. Go now while you have a chance before it's too late. If he catches me now, he'll kill me if I'm lucky!' And then everything happens - the Mad Max costumes, the dry ice, the raw guitar chords. Eric Dober, the rhythm guitarist, had told me he was nervous; this was his first performance in the band. Alice had told Dober to make his playing as raw as feasibly possible, to 'make that guitar just a horrible thing'. And now Dober is bucking over his guitar, squeezing a suitably hellish noise from it. The show runs smoothly. The Newcastle fans seem to be either young or fairly old - a good proportion are well into middle age. One kid has the word 'Twisted' inked across his face. 'I'm Twisted Boy,' he tells me. Adults, I think, like Alice because he reminds them of the time when they used to say that the world was going to hell in a handcart, but did not really believe it. Kids see him as another point on the hellish cartography that is their cultural world. Alice stabs the baby; Alice shuts his daughter in the boot of the car. The guillotine scene works well. Alice croaks out his Aids-era song, 'Poison' ('You're poison, running through my veins'). When he sings 'School's Out', lots of people stand up and start bopping around. Towards the end, he disappears and comes back wearing a T-shirt which says 'Britney Wants Me' on the front, and 'Dead' on the back. Calico appears, dressed as Britney. They fight. After the show, Alice has agreed to 'meet and greet' some competition winners and members of a local golf organisation. 'Say please and thank you,' says one man to his son. One man, a collector of Alice memorabilia, asks Brian Nelson to sign something. In the car afterwards, Alice sings 'There's no business like show business' in a jaunty manner. We drive through the windy streets of Newcastle towards the golden arches. 'We should do a commercial for these guys,' says Alice. Then he says, 'At least I'm always thinking. I've always got an angle. I'm an ideas man.' But when we get to McDonald's, there is a huge tailback. The queue has been caused by Alice Cooper fans, who left the venue before us. 'I'll have a quarter pounder with cheese,' says Alice. And we join the end of the queue. \u0095 Alice Cooper tours the UK from 15 to 21 May. For ticket information, call 0115 912 9129.",

      "body": "<p>When I sat down in the surgery waiting room, I was aware that people were giving me strange looks. Perhaps it wasn't surprising: wouldn't you stare at someone still in her pyjamas, eyes bulging, head lolling around like a cow with BSE, dry retching and babbling incoherently? They probably had me down as one of the local winos or drug addicts.</p> <p>Of course, I'm not a wino or drug addict. Incredible as it may seem, I was in this state because I had drunk too much water. Incredible because, these days, we're constantly being told we don't drink enough water. Anything less than eight large glasses of water a day, and your body is under-hydrated, resulting in tiredness, depression, headaches, sallow skin, blocked innards and general unhappiness.</p> <p>According to some devotees, water can reduce the risk of bladder and other cancers. And there are websites that will tell you how much water there is in everything (bananas 74 per cent, half a cup of cooked rice 89 per cent, if you really want to know). There are also those who set great store by not only how much we drink but also when we drink it (first thing in the morning, good; during mealtimes, bad). Quite often it seems as if we've gone back a few hundred years and are being sold a modern version of hydropathy. That was the treatment thought up by a German peasant called Vincenz Priessnitz in 1799, who recommended using water to rid the body of what he termed 'bad juices', which he believed were responsible for all illnesses.</p> <p>According to Medical Blunders by Robert Youngson and Ian Schott (a must for any self-respecting hypochondriac), the treatment at his spa in Graefenberg was simple but highly popular: wrap yourself from head to foot, drink a glass of water every 30 minutes and wait for the sweat to flush out all those 'bad juices'. He also recommended water enemas, not a million miles from the thinking behind the benefits of what's now called colonic irrigation (whose fans apparently included Princess Diana).</p> <p>For women prone to cystitis, water is, along with cranberry juice - whose prophylactic properties are now widely recognised - your saviour. Everyone from girlfriends to women's magazines tells you that the way to flush out that nasty bug is with lots of water. Which is all very well, but if you wake in the middle of the night with what you suspect are the early signs of a urinary infection, just make sure you keep an eye on exactly how much you're drinking.</p> <p>Which is just what I didn't do a few weeks ago. Waking up at 5am for a pee and feeling that telltale burning sensation, I did what any woman who heeds the advice would do: I sat on the toilet with a jug of water by my side. After a few trips to the kitchen for a refill, I ended up with a very bad case of the runs - and strangely, I'd stopped peeing as much. Determined to flush out the infection, though, I kept downing the water. After 90 minutes of this - by which time I'd probably got through something like four litres - the burning sensation went only to be replaced by something more sinister: a strange throbbing headache, awful nausea and a worrying sense of confusion. Thankfully my faculties - and inbuilt alarm system - hadn't deserted me completely and, after a phone call to a local casualty department, I was advised to head straight to my GP (with what they thought was a suspected bladder infection).</p> <p>My GP tested my urine but found no sign of any bacteria and so asked me to tell him exactly what I had done in the preceding few hours. Although he had been thinking about prescribing antibiotics (the usual treatment for bladder infection), his suspicions were already aroused. My claims that it was cystitis didn't tally with the evidence - my urine sample showed no rogue bacteria, but it did provide a vital clue. 'It is completely clear, not yellow at all, almost totally water,' he said, and then sent me to the chemist with a prescription for a strong diuretic. Two of these were enough to provoke four of the longest pees I've ever had. Immediately, the headache cleared, the nausea lifted and my eyes and mind were able to focus properly. My GP checked up on me twice during the next 10 hours, possibly to make sure I hadn't lost consciousness.</p> <p>Because that's what could have happened if I hadn't sought medical advice. Excessive water intake can result in water intoxication, which occurs when too much water is retained in the brain.

      "bodyText": "When I sat down in the surgery waiting room, I was aware that people were giving me strange looks. Perhaps it wasn't surprising: wouldn't you stare at someone still in her pyjamas, eyes bulging, head lolling around like a cow with BSE, dry retching and babbling incoherently? They probably had me down as one of the local winos or drug addicts. Of course, I'm not a wino or drug addict. Incredible as it may seem, I was in this state because I had drunk too much water. Incredible because, these days, we're constantly being told we don't drink enough water. Anything less than eight large glasses of water a day, and your body is under-hydrated, resulting in tiredness, depression, headaches, sallow skin, blocked innards and general unhappiness. According to some devotees, water can reduce the risk of bladder and other cancers. And there are websites that will tell you how much water there is in everything (bananas 74 per cent, half a cup of cooked rice 89 per cent, if you really want to know). There are also those who set great store by not only how much we drink but also when we drink it (first thing in the morning, good; during mealtimes, bad). Quite often it seems as if we've gone back a few hundred years and are being sold a modern version of hydropathy. That was the treatment thought up by a German peasant called Vincenz Priessnitz in 1799, who recommended using water to rid the body of what he termed 'bad juices', which he believed were responsible for all illnesses. According to Medical Blunders by Robert Youngson and Ian Schott (a must for any self-respecting hypochondriac), the treatment at his spa in Graefenberg was simple but highly popular: wrap yourself from head to foot, drink a glass of water every 30 minutes and wait for the sweat to flush out all those 'bad juices'. He also recommended water enemas, not a million miles from the thinking behind the benefits of what's now called colonic irrigation (whose fans apparently included Princess Diana). For women prone to cystitis, water is, along with cranberry juice - whose prophylactic properties are now widely recognised - your saviour. Everyone from girlfriends to women's magazines tells you that the way to flush out that nasty bug is with lots of water. Which is all very well, but if you wake in the middle of the night with what you suspect are the early signs of a urinary infection, just make sure you keep an eye on exactly how much you're drinking. Which is just what I didn't do a few weeks ago. Waking up at 5am for a pee and feeling that telltale burning sensation, I did what any woman who heeds the advice would do: I sat on the toilet with a jug of water by my side. After a few trips to the kitchen for a refill, I ended up with a very bad case of the runs - and strangely, I'd stopped peeing as much. Determined to flush out the infection, though, I kept downing the water. After 90 minutes of this - by which time I'd probably got through something like four litres - the burning sensation went only to be replaced by something more sinister: a strange throbbing headache, awful nausea and a worrying sense of confusion. Thankfully my faculties - and inbuilt alarm system - hadn't deserted me completely and, after a phone call to a local casualty department, I was advised to head straight to my GP (with what they thought was a suspected bladder infection). My GP tested my urine but found no sign of any bacteria and so asked me to tell him exactly what I had done in the preceding few hours. Although he had been thinking about prescribing antibiotics (the usual treatment for bladder infection), his suspicions were already aroused. My claims that it was cystitis didn't tally with the evidence - my urine sample showed no rogue bacteria, but it did provide a vital clue. 'It is completely clear, not yellow at all, almost totally water,' he said, and then sent me to the chemist with a prescription for a strong diuretic. Two of these were enough to provoke four of the longest pees I've ever had. Immediately, the headache cleared, the nausea lifted and my eyes and mind were able to focus properly. My GP checked up on me twice during the next 10 hours, possibly to make sure I hadn't lost consciousness. Because that's what could have happened if I hadn't sought medical advice. Excessive water intake can result in water intoxication, which occurs when too much water is retained in the brain. It's a condition which, according to Professor Steven Sacks, head of renal medicine at Guy's, King's and Thomas' School of Medicine, is not very common because 'the rate at which you take in the water is important. It's really quite hard to do.' If you do manage it, though, the sodium level in the body is diluted and, because it's sodium that controls the level of water flowing into the tissues through osmosis, any reduction in the sodium level upsets the flow of water and salts inside and outside the cells, resulting in cell swelling all over the body. When that happens in the brain, it creates nausea, headaches, confusion and, in extreme cases, convulsions and coma; in other words, cerebral oedema.

      "body": "<p>Finding myself virtually midway between my 30th and 40th birthdays, I have recently abandoned running and have instead embarked on a renewed quest for eternal youth by taking up yoga. I've found that sitting quietly, humming and 'saluting the sun' in the morning allows me to breathe deeply and thereby oxygenate every centimetre of my body. I've also noticed that concentrating on breathing deeply for a few minutes before going to bed helps me to drift into a slumber that insomniacs would trade their right arms for.</p> <p>Sleeping soundly rewards us with health benefits far beyond the accepted increased capacity to work and play hard: crucially, it enables us to look younger and our organs to perform more efficiently. This is because slumber prompts the pituitary gland to release growth hormone (GH), a super-restorative that increases the amount of nutrients absorbed by the body's cells, encourages the growth and repair of muscles and bone, and strengthens the immune system. The rate of tissue growth and repair is greatest at night because, under the influence of GH, this is when our cells are the most active and are multiplying themselves the most vigorously. This is why sleep deprivation is reflected in our skin: if we don't get enough replenishing sleep, the pituitary gland produces less GH, the rate of skin-cell replacement slows down, and the skin loses its clarity and bloom. All in all, the more you can do during the day - especially during the late afternoon and early evening - to prepare your body for a good night's slumber, the better.</p> <p>Caffeine-rich drinks are among the most common causes of insomnia, and some people, particularly hyperactive children, can be so sensitive to caffeine that even having a coffee or cola in the morning can disrupt their sleep. Drinking non-caffeine-containing drinks, such as fresh fruit juice, during the day, or a herbal infusion such as camomile tea or a hot, milky drink (apart from chocolate, which contains caffeine) at night should encourage you or your child to wind down sufficiently to sleep deeply and kick-start the production of a hefty dose of growth hormone, nature's own elixir of youth.</p> <p><b>Nutrition news: Playing dirty</b></p> <p>The number of children who have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is far higher than was previously thought, according to a nationwide study carried out by the Institute of Child Health, the British Society of Gastroenterology Research Unit and the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit. Professor Bhupinder Sandhu, of the Institute of Child Health, believes that this increase can be explained by the relatively clean environment in which British children now live: it is thought that not being exposed to the same range of bacteria as their parents somehow alters their immune system. (Alternatively, a microbe in food could be responsible.) The popularity of so-called 'anti-bacterial' cleaning and disinfecting products, along with discouraging children from playing outside and becoming dirty, may therefore be contributory factors in the higher number of cases.</p> <p><b>Your questions</b></p> <p>How come high-fibre foods, such as wholemeal brown breads and pasta, brown rice and bran are meant to be better for you than the white, processed variety? And do they help you lose weight, rather than the processed kind, as I have been led to believe?<br><b> Romani, London</b></p> <p>There is confusion regarding the words 'brown', 'wholemeal' and 'wholegrain'. Because there is no legal definition of the word 'brown', many 'brown' products are, in fact, white products that have been dyed. By contrast, wholegrain and wholemeal products are legally required to include the whole of a plant's husk.</p> <p>Wholemeal products such as wholegrain rice, bread and pasta are healthier than white, processed foods because they contain more fibre, the plant material that stimulates the gut to produce substances that ward off heart disease and cancer. Fibre encourages the liver to produce high-density lipoprotein ('good' cholesterol) and reduces the absorption of the fats and sugars that can lead to obesity, diabetes and heart disease. Wholemeals also swell in the presence of plenty of water, thereby stimulating the gut to transport food through it efficiently. And, as if that wasn't enough, the plant husks that wholemeal products contain endow them with beneficial nutrients, such as B vitamins, zinc and magnesium.</p> <p>High-fibre foods do help you to lose weight, because water drunk with them prompts the fibre to swell in the stomach, thereby stimulating stretch receptors in the stomach lining to send positive signals to the fullness centre in the brain. As a result, and unlike its white relation, wholemeal bread will make you feel more satisfied and thus less tempted to eat as much.</p>",

This is why sleep deprivation is reflected in our skin: if we don't get enough replenishing sleep, the pituitary gland produces less GH, the rate of skin-cell replacement slows down, and the skin loses its clarity and bloom. All in all, the more you can do during the day - especially during the late afternoon and early evening - to prepare your body for a good night's slumber, the better. Caffeine-rich drinks are among the most common causes of insomnia, and some people, particularly hyperactive children, can be so sensitive to caffeine that even having a coffee or cola in the morning can disrupt their sleep. Drinking non-caffeine-containing drinks, such as fresh fruit juice, during the day, or a herbal infusion such as camomile tea or a hot, milky drink (apart from chocolate, which contains caffeine) at night should encourage you or your child to wind down sufficiently to sleep deeply and kick-start the production of a hefty dose of growth hormone, nature's own elixir of youth. Nutrition news: Playing dirty The number of children who have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is far higher than was previously thought, according to a nationwide study carried out by the Institute of Child Health, the British Society of Gastroenterology Research Unit and the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit. Professor Bhupinder Sandhu, of the Institute of Child Health, believes that this increase can be explained by the relatively clean environment in which British children now live: it is thought that not being exposed to the same range of bacteria as their parents somehow alters their immune system. (Alternatively, a microbe in food could be responsible.) The popularity of so-called 'anti-bacterial' cleaning and disinfecting products, along with discouraging children from playing outside and becoming dirty, may therefore be contributory factors in the higher number of cases. Your questions How come high-fibre foods, such as wholemeal brown breads and pasta, brown rice and bran are meant to be better for you than the white, processed variety? And do they help you lose weight, rather than the processed kind, as I have been led to believe? Romani, London There is confusion regarding the words 'brown', 'wholemeal' and 'wholegrain'. Because there is no legal definition of the word 'brown', many 'brown' products are, in fact, white products that have been dyed. By contrast, wholegrain and wholemeal products are legally required to include the whole of a plant's husk. Wholemeal products such as wholegrain rice, bread and pasta are healthier than white, processed foods because they contain more fibre, the plant material that stimulates the gut to produce substances that ward off heart disease and cancer. Fibre encourages the liver to produce high-density lipoprotein ('good' cholesterol) and reduces the absorption of the fats and sugars that can lead to obesity, diabetes and heart disease. Wholemeals also swell in the presence of plenty of water, thereby stimulating the gut to transport food through it efficiently. And, as if that wasn't enough, the plant husks that wholemeal products contain endow them with beneficial nutrients, such as B vitamins, zinc and magnesium. High-fibre foods do help you to lose weight, because water drunk with them prompts the fibre to swell in the stomach, thereby stimulating stretch receptors in the stomach lining to send positive signals to the fullness centre in the brain. As a result, and unlike its white relation, wholemeal bread will make you feel more satisfied and thus less tempted to eat as much.",

Not so much on stage, but the social bit. </p> <p>The first time I met Bill was in 1963 in this pub that used to be opposite the World's End, Chelsea, near where Mick, Keith and Brian used to live in Edith Grove. He had a huge bass amp which was a big deal at the time. He'd been in the band about a week. And he used to have a teddy boy cut, much to my anger, because he's a little bit older than us - but we don't mention that. </p> <p>In 30 years of the Stones, I never fell out with Bill. He's a very kind person, easy-going. We were very close in the band structure. We were the rhythm section, so his problems were nearly always my problems. When he left the band - God, bloody hell! - I could have killed him. We had two weeks where I was playing three hours a day to audition new bass players. I was dead at the end, my bloody hands were killing me. Ninety per cent of choosing a person is that you live with them. Bill was always easy to live with. We've seen each other through various ups and downs. </p> <p>The last time he was with us was when he married that dreadful Mandy girl. I think it was one of the lowest periods of his life. It was a kind of nervous breakdown; just trying to keep together was hell. He used to sometimes confide in me. Now it's wonderful that he's found Suzanne (his third wife, whom he married in 1993) and has three lovely children. Many times I'd see him when I was having a difficult time. I'd go and knock in the early hours, and just sit there, and I think I got on his nerves, like most drunks. </p> <p>These days he calls sometimes. He's not allowed to come to my gigs at Ronnie's, it's too intellectual for him and I don't go to his, it's too much dumbing down. No, I'm joking.

      "bodyText": "Charlie Watts: The Rolling Stones was a solid entity. Bill could play with the Stones now and it would be like the Stones 30 years ago. I miss having Bill around. Not so much on stage, but the social bit. The first time I met Bill was in 1963 in this pub that used to be opposite the World's End, Chelsea, near where Mick, Keith and Brian used to live in Edith Grove. He had a huge bass amp which was a big deal at the time. He'd been in the band about a week. And he used to have a teddy boy cut, much to my anger, because he's a little bit older than us - but we don't mention that. In 30 years of the Stones, I never fell out with Bill. He's a very kind person, easy-going. We were very close in the band structure. We were the rhythm section, so his problems were nearly always my problems. When he left the band - God, bloody hell! - I could have killed him. We had two weeks where I was playing three hours a day to audition new bass players. I was dead at the end, my bloody hands were killing me. Ninety per cent of choosing a person is that you live with them. Bill was always easy to live with. We've seen each other through various ups and downs. The last time he was with us was when he married that dreadful Mandy girl. I think it was one of the lowest periods of his life. It was a kind of nervous breakdown; just trying to keep together was hell. He used to sometimes confide in me. Now it's wonderful that he's found Suzanne (his third wife, whom he married in 1993) and has three lovely children. Many times I'd see him when I was having a difficult time. I'd go and knock in the early hours, and just sit there, and I think I got on his nerves, like most drunks. These days he calls sometimes. He's not allowed to come to my gigs at Ronnie's, it's too intellectual for him and I don't go to his, it's too much dumbing down. No, I'm joking. I think he'd like to see my band, but he's not sitting near the front. And I'll try and see him with the Rhythm Kings because he has some wonderful musicians. Bill was always the most sensible of all of us. Mind you, I was never that mad. Bill Wyman: I don't miss anything about the Stones since leaving in 1993. Well, I miss the money, that's about all.

      "body": "<p>There's something really seductive about miniature things. The charm of a doll's house is that it is a miniaturised version of an adult world. It's like those tiny models of design classic chairs you can buy. Sure you'd like the full-scale Eames Eiffel chair in your living room, but having the miniature version sitting on your shelves is almost as good. But for most parents, there is nothing charming whatsoever about their children's bedrooms, where the beds are smaller, the chairs and tables are a fifth the size of the ones in the rest of the house, and the mess is bigger and more chaotic than in any other room. Small is not necessarily beautiful. Welcome to the pigsty. </p> <p> While children seem to have more toys than previous generations, there are more and more solutions for making their bedrooms bright and beautiful. Ikea (020 8208 5600) has expanded its children's section to include everything the modern nursery could possibly need: toys, rugs with hopscotch 'chalked' on to it (Hoppa, \u00a325), comical bulbous plastic stools (Mammut, \u00a35 each) in bright, primary colours, and storage crates (Mard, \u00a32.90 each). There are even miniature bucket-and-mop sets (Duktig, \u00a35), designed to teach your children to clean as they learn. Who are they trying to kid? </p> <p>For some parents, however, brightly coloured plastic is not the ideal home environment. Interiors stylist Rebecca Duke has not compromised her own style for her children's bedrooms, which are surprisingly tidy and minimal. Coco, five, is the proud owner of a French wrought-iron bed, painted to match the walls. 'She said she wanted pink,' says Duke. The paint is all Designers Guild. And the bed is a bargain find from a junk shop, which Duke sanded down and painted to look like new. There are also green chairs - child's size - also a find from a junk shop. 'I'm not into children's wallpapers and fabric. I'm a junk-shop queen,' says Duke. </p> <p>'Everything is old and salvaged - funny bits and pieces that I've found on my travels.' On the floor is a purple, stripy rug from Habitat. Coco shares the room with her baby sister Minnie, who sleeps in a cot. Next door, their three-year-old brother Jedd has a room to himself, painted little-boy blue, chosen from The Paint Library. Most of his toys are tidied away in Ikea storage boxes, leaving the room looking clean and simple. His bed is made from MDF and painted the same colour as the walls. Tim Chapman designs children's beds like Jedd's and sells them, unpainted and ready for assembly, through his mail-order company, Bump. Jedd's sleigh day bed is available in four different mattress sizes, for \u00a3225, plus \u00a3125 for the mattress. It also comes as a bunk bed, for \u00a3435 for the frame. For a brochure, call 020 7249 7000. </p> <p>Another alternative to primary-coloured plastics is plywood. Two years ago, the north London furniture showroom twentytwentyone (020 7288 1996) came up with the Childsply project - a brief for designers to make a piece of functional children's furniture out of plywood. It is now touring with the British Council and is currently in Berlin. Robin Day's chair has since gone into production and is a perfectly simple construction designed, as ever, to be practical, long-lasting and comfortable; it costs \u00a399. Simon Alderson of twentytwentyone was one of the brains behind Childsply. 'We have a lot of enquiries about children's furniture,' he says. He sees the market divided into two categories. 'From the parental point of view, pieces should be durable and cost-effective because the child is going to outgrow them and destroy them anyway.' </p> <p>Other children's furniture on sale at twentytwentyone include the classic Bertoia wire chair (from \u00a3150), which has been scaled down for children with an aesthetic eye and rich parents. The stackable Kartell Centro Kappa chair in plastic (\u00a348) and the Swedish company Trip Trapp's colourful plywood Hippo rocking chair (\u00a399) are both also available to order. </p> <p>Some of the pieces originally shown as part of Childsply are now in production with the independent company Oreka Kids. This is the first collection of furniture to be made exclusively for children, and has been overseen by designers Michael Marriot and Simon Maidment. Their brief to a team of seven designers has been to design furniture that was neither miniature adult designs, nor oversized toys, but multifunctional objects that would stimulate activity and creativity. Jane Atfield has come up with Amaretti, a trolley which can be used as a cart, baby bed or simply as storage (\u00a3235); the Azumis have designed Oreo, a work table and bench which can be flat-packed and carried by children (\u00a3355); Flapjack is by Sebastian Bergne - a shoe and coat locker where kids can learn to tie laces and record their height (\u00a3260).</p> <p> Matthew Hilton's Jammy Dodger can be a fantasy house, train, boat, castle, desk or seat (\u00a3230). High prices go hand in hand with small UK production, but at least the designs are a step in the right direction. </p> <p>The Biscuit collection is available by mail order, and from selected outlets. For more information, call 020 8884 3435 or go to <a href=\"http://www.orekakids.com\">www.orekakids.com</a> to place an order. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, the Biscuit range has made it into the Design Museum before the shop floor. It's on show as part of the Minor Works exhibition, which ends today, alongside some prototypes by students at Buckingham University, and last year's Childsform project, another project for twentytwentyone where designers were given a block of foam to create a game, toy or piece of furniture for one- to six-year-olds. And yes, there are chairs to sit on, so your kids can tell you if they're any good. </p> <p>For father-of-two Andrew Dunbar, expensive 'designer' children's furniture is not an option. He has found that the most useful piece of furniture his children own is something he knocked up himself. It's a sturdy, low footstool made out of pine, with a grab hole in the middle. For Ellie, almost four, and Daisy, almost two, it has become indispensable. The girls use it to make adult-sized homes more child-friendly - to stand on to reach the sink to brush their teeth, or to get things from the fridge. They have four in the house. The stools have been such a hit, Dunbar has gone into production with them. They are \u00a325, and can be ordered by calling 01702 716 363.</p>",

The government should create a department for social inclusion to work with the Home Office and other Ministries. As well as social deprivation and exclusion, its remit should cover 'ethnic community affairs', acknowledging that, while anti-discrimination laws are essential, legislation does nothing to remove prejudice. It requires a more joined-up approach to tackle the underlying causes. The Home Office has generated mistrust among ethnic communities. It is not the department to promote better race relations.

A powerful shot of drugs has left the Asiatic black bear flat on her back as she is carried from a tiny cage in one of China's notorious bear farms.</p> <p>Gail Cochrane, a vet from Irvine near Glasgow, examines the recumbent Pooh and declares her 'a lucky bear'. The term 'lucky' is relative. Pooh, who weighs nearly 17 stone, has just been released from a cage measuring 2ft by 4ft by 2ft 6in. Other, bigger bears have spent more than 20 years in smaller cages, some with crush bars forcing them to spend their lives spreadeagled on the floor. Pooh is among the few bears who will not need surgery to repair their injured bodies.</p> <p>She is the last of 60 bears released by the charity Animals Asia. Within five years 500 bears will have been set free. The first 60 are part of a pilot scheme in Sichuan province, the biggest habitat of this endangered bear species, also known as moon bears because of the crescents on their chest fur.</p> <p>Tai Tan is not such a 'lucky bear'. Cochrane had to remove a metal catheter, used by Tai Tan's masters to tap the bile in her gall bladder, allowing it to be milked daily. Cochrane breezes through the operation in a newly refurbished rescue centre at Long Qiao, an hour's drive from Chengdu, capital of Sichuan. Tai Tan has many of the ailments found in these captive bears. Her teeth are all broken from gnawing the bars of her cage and the soles of her paws are covered with cracks. She has not walked for years.</p> <p>While Cochrane extracts a bloody mess of metal, fat and tissue from the stomach, Beverly Elmer, a veterinary nurse from Suffolk, removes years of plaque from the teeth.</p> <p>Why have these creatures had to suffer so? Because they are farmed for their bile, an ingredient of Chinese medicine used to cure fevers, liver complaints and sore eyes. And the bile-pumpers have done their job well: there is now an over supply and the surplus is being used in shampoos, anti-wrinkle creams and even wine.</p> <p>In 1998 Jill Robinson from Nottingham, founder of Animals Asia, took her first tour of bear farms with Cochrane. One of the 'farms' was in a five-storey block of flats. Climbing two flights of stairs, they entered a flat with 32 bears crammed into four rooms.</p> <p>Some farms were better, but all kept these large wild animals crushed in tiny cages. When bear farming started in the mid-Eighties Chinese farms used primitive surgery to insert the catheter, leading to infections. The severity of the internal problems often killed the bear. Four of the 64 rescued in this pilot scheme never made it to freedom; peritonitis and septicemia took them first.</p> <p>The Chinese government eventually replaced the use of catheters with a 'free dripping' method which involves drilling a hole in the abdomen and pushing up a thin plastic tube to milk the bladder. Cochrane shakes her head at the idea that this is supposed to be 'more humane'. It is the source of constant inflammation and infection, she says, and exposes the abdomen to the risk of leaking, which can lead to death.</p> <p>The irony of this maltreatment is that it began with the Chinese government's attempts to conserve the bears. In 1984-85 licences were issued to farm 2,000 bears. The original target was to issue 40,000 licences by the Year 2000. Robinson says grimly: 'If nothing else, our campaign of exposure has worked and at least that hasn't happened.' There are still 7,000 bears in farms according to official figures, and other estimates are higher. The deal worked out between the Chinese government and Animals Asia in July 1999 commits China to phasing out bear farming altogether. Meanwhile, 500 bears will be saved and bear farms are being closed down. The charity pays the farmers compensation - 'quite enough to set up an alternative business,' says Robinson.</p> <p>Animals Asia's critics say it has been duped by the authorities into allowing the bile trade to continue by providing a humanitarian cover, but Robinson believes China is genuine in wanting to eradicate the farms and that bear farming will end in her lifetime.</p> <p>Freedom, a young female whose front paws were lost, presumably when she was trapped, is in the enclosure where recovering bears are given their first taste of grass, fresh air and water in a pool. She is rolling around, clasping tuffs of turf in the stumps of her legs. 'It makes you fit to burst,' says Robinson.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Pooh is now recovering after being released and is waiting for a sponsor.

A battle of wills between a determined state and fanatical prisoners ready to die for their cause is turning into a tragedy.</p> <p>Umus has been refusing food for nearly 200 days. Like other prisoners she has been taking sugared water, salt and vitamins. When she loses consciousness, hospital staff pump blood serum into her body. But as soon as she wakes up, she demands the treatment be stopped.</p> <p>'From time to time we believe there has been force-feeding,' said Dr Osman Ozturk from the Turkish Medical Association. 'But the state has been unable to make it systematic, because it is against medical ethics.'</p> <p>More than a hundred of the most seriously ill prisoners have been transferred to hospital wards where soldiers guard the doors. Each inmate has a relative who stays with them 24 hours a day. Many families appear to support the struggle.</p> <p>'This is the choice my daughter has made,' Fatma Sahingoz said calmly. 'I'm a mother and I'm dying with her. But I have to respect her choice. The state should take some steps to allow our children to survive.'</p> <p>Belatedly, the government has introduced legislation which would ease the regime of isolation in prisons, which is at the heart of the dispute. Human rights groups have already criticised the proposals, which have yet to be approved by parliament, as inadequate.</p> <p>The hunger strike began in October as a protest against plans to transfer prisoners from dormitory wards into new 'F-type' prisons where inmates are held in small cells, either in solitary confinement or with up to two other people.</p> <p>Security forces stormed 20 jails in December and transferred about 1,000 inmates to the new prisons. Thirty prisoners and two soldiers were killed in four days of clashes, but the enforced transfers did not end the 'death fast'.</p> <p>The prisoners have a long list of demands, which the government refuses to discuss. Officials say a return to the dormitory system is out of the question. Under the old regime, inmates ran their own wards and indoctrinated new recruits.</p> <p>'The state cannot be held hostage by terrorists,' Justice Minister Hikmet Sami Turk has said. He has promised modern prisons which conform to international standards. 'I have a clear conscience,' he said last week, 'and I appeal to the prisoners to give up their meaningless protest.'</p> <p>The hunger strikers have gained little public sympathy as their protest has intensified. But they seem to feel that they have nothing to lose and among the left-wing groups behind the hunger strike dedication to the cause is undiminished.</p> <p>Of the 20 people who have died so far, four have been prisoners' relatives and supporters who have joined the protest in private houses in Istanbul and Izmir. Three volunteers died in a shanty house overlooking the Bosphorous. 'I am smiling at death,' wrote Gulsuman Donmez in a letter to her 11-year-old son shortly before she died. 'Only someone who is on hunger strike can know these feelings. I love you and I hope you understand.'</p> <p>Such extraordinary sentiments arise from a long history of bad blood between the Turkish state and the hardline political Left. In the new prisons inmates say they are isolated and beaten by wardens. Umus Sahingoz has told her mother she has been raped. There is no way to confirm the prisoners' claims, but pressure groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have demanded a full inquiry.</p> <p>The Turkish government should 'take all necessary measures to eradicate torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment', Amnesty said last week. '(It)... must ensure that each individual deprived of their liberty is treated with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person.'</p> <p>The mounting death toll is doing little for Turkey's battered human rights image, but criticism from European governments has been muted. 'It has been badly handled, but there's no obvious solution,' one diplomat said.</p> <p>The immediate need is for a short-term deal to end the protest, but neither side seems prepared to compromise. 'Now they're dying one by one,' Fatma said. 'Very soon it will be five by five.'</p>",

More than a hundred of the most seriously ill prisoners have been transferred to hospital wards where soldiers guard the doors. Each inmate has a relative who stays with them 24 hours a day. Many families appear to support the struggle. 'This is the choice my daughter has made,' Fatma Sahingoz said calmly. 'I'm a mother and I'm dying with her. But I have to respect her choice. The state should take some steps to allow our children to survive.' Belatedly, the government has introduced legislation which would ease the regime of isolation in prisons, which is at the heart of the dispute. Human rights groups have already criticised the proposals, which have yet to be approved by parliament, as inadequate. The hunger strike began in October as a protest against plans to transfer prisoners from dormitory wards into new 'F-type' prisons where inmates are held in small cells, either in solitary confinement or with up to two other people. Security forces stormed 20 jails in December and transferred about 1,000 inmates to the new prisons. Thirty prisoners and two soldiers were killed in four days of clashes, but the enforced transfers did not end the 'death fast'. The prisoners have a long list of demands, which the government refuses to discuss. Officials say a return to the dormitory system is out of the question. Under the old regime, inmates ran their own wards and indoctrinated new recruits. 'The state cannot be held hostage by terrorists,' Justice Minister Hikmet Sami Turk has said. He has promised modern prisons which conform to international standards. 'I have a clear conscience,' he said last week, 'and I appeal to the prisoners to give up their meaningless protest.' The hunger strikers have gained little public sympathy as their protest has intensified. But they seem to feel that they have nothing to lose and among the left-wing groups behind the hunger strike dedication to the cause is undiminished. Of the 20 people who have died so far, four have been prisoners' relatives and supporters who have joined the protest in private houses in Istanbul and Izmir. Three volunteers died in a shanty house overlooking the Bosphorous. 'I am smiling at death,' wrote Gulsuman Donmez in a letter to her 11-year-old son shortly before she died. 'Only someone who is on hunger strike can know these feelings. I love you and I hope you understand.' Such extraordinary sentiments arise from a long history of bad blood between the Turkish state and the hardline political Left. In the new prisons inmates say they are isolated and beaten by wardens. Umus Sahingoz has told her mother she has been raped. There is no way to confirm the prisoners' claims, but pressure groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have demanded a full inquiry. The Turkish government should 'take all necessary measures to eradicate torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment', Amnesty said last week. '(It)... must ensure that each individual deprived of their liberty is treated with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person.' The mounting death toll is doing little for Turkey's battered human rights image, but criticism from European governments has been muted. 'It has been badly handled, but there's no obvious solution,' one diplomat said. The immediate need is for a short-term deal to end the protest, but neither side seems prepared to compromise. 'Now they're dying one by one,' Fatma said. 'Very soon it will be five by five.'",

More than 32 supporters of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) have been killed in state-sponsored political violence in the past year. The threat came as Mugabe loyalists, particularly the war veterans led by Chenjerai 'Hitler' Hunzvi, began a campaign of violence and extortion directed at factories and businesses in urban areas. 'Our next target will be to deal once and for all with foreign embassies and non-governmental organisations who fund the Movement for Democratic Change,' Hunzvi said.

      "body": "<p>Hollywood is known for its excess. Excessive wages, excessive budgets, excessive awards shows. Now the drug problem that has long bedevilled the entertainment industry is causing concern not just on account of its excess, but for being unstoppable. The result, as Hollywood bible Entertainment Weekly reports, is that 'recovery has practically become LA's second-biggest industry'.</p> <p>The arrest last week of Robert Downey Jr in a bleak Los Angeles alleyway for suspected drug use, mere days away from his scheduled appearance before a Palm Springs judge for a parole-violating drugs transgression last November, has set off warning bells in the creative community. Actors' careers in jeopardy is only one factor; the other is Hollywood's growing realisation that rehabilitation is now a routine part of life for many of its recidivist users. Kelsey Grammer of Frasier, Friends star Matthew Perry, Courtney Love, Melanie Griffith and Christian Slater have all benefited from rehab.</p> <p>Centres such as Malibu Promises and the Daniel Freeman Drug Rehab Clinic in Los Angeles and Hazelden in Minnesota are the immediate refuge for fallen stars. The 30-day treatment plans at Malibu Promises begin with detox and then a daily regimen that includes group and individual therapy as well as physical workouts. According to the centre's brochure, treats offered include meals prepared by a gourmet chef.</p> <p>'I think rehab is just absorbed into the culture,' says Bruce Porter, author of Blow, the non-fiction book about how Hollywood met cocaine, which has been turned into a film starring Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz. 'The cycle seems to be: you do a little rehab, you go back to work, the rehab didn't take, so you go back to drugs, you do a little more rehab. That's going to be our next story - that rehab doesn't really work.'</p> <p>In Downey's case, even a 12-month stint in prison didn't work. The actor, whose on-going guest spot on Ally McBeal was reportedly cut short by creator-producer David E. Kelley after the latest incident, was released last August and appeared on magazine covers under headlines like 'Mr. Clean'. For Downey, however, rehab was not the magic cure that many believe it to be.</p> <p>Neither was it for Aaron Sorkin, the 39-year-old creator of the White House drama The West Wing. After kicking a cocaine addiction five years ago - for which he received an 'award' from the Phoenix House substance abuse recovery centre - Sorkin was arrested on 15 April at Burbank Airport for possession of magic mushrooms and marijuana.</p> <p>Whether it's cocaine, as with Downey and Sorkin, or painkillers such as Vicodin (Perry's addiction, which earlier this year forced him from the set of his movie Servicing Sarah and away from taping Friends), it appears that the real difficulty is not getting stars to acknowledge they have a problem - after all, drug counsellors are now a common sight on TV and movie sets. The more serious issue is whether stars can ever get out of the spiral of addiction when surrounded by a culture as frenzied as Hollywood's.</p> <p>'In the creative world, where at the end of a day or at the end of a gig there's this tremendous letdown when the work is done, there's this compulsion to retrieve something of that,' says Porter. 'Cocaine is a drug that's much more geared toward the creative process.

      "bodyText": "Hollywood is known for its excess. Excessive wages, excessive budgets, excessive awards shows. Now the drug problem that has long bedevilled the entertainment industry is causing concern not just on account of its excess, but for being unstoppable. The result, as Hollywood bible Entertainment Weekly reports, is that 'recovery has practically become LA's second-biggest industry'. The arrest last week of Robert Downey Jr in a bleak Los Angeles alleyway for suspected drug use, mere days away from his scheduled appearance before a Palm Springs judge for a parole-violating drugs transgression last November, has set off warning bells in the creative community. Actors' careers in jeopardy is only one factor; the other is Hollywood's growing realisation that rehabilitation is now a routine part of life for many of its recidivist users. Kelsey Grammer of Frasier, Friends star Matthew Perry, Courtney Love, Melanie Griffith and Christian Slater have all benefited from rehab. Centres such as Malibu Promises and the Daniel Freeman Drug Rehab Clinic in Los Angeles and Hazelden in Minnesota are the immediate refuge for fallen stars. The 30-day treatment plans at Malibu Promises begin with detox and then a daily regimen that includes group and individual therapy as well as physical workouts. According to the centre's brochure, treats offered include meals prepared by a gourmet chef. 'I think rehab is just absorbed into the culture,' says Bruce Porter, author of Blow, the non-fiction book about how Hollywood met cocaine, which has been turned into a film starring Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz. 'The cycle seems to be: you do a little rehab, you go back to work, the rehab didn't take, so you go back to drugs, you do a little more rehab. That's going to be our next story - that rehab doesn't really work.' In Downey's case, even a 12-month stint in prison didn't work. The actor, whose on-going guest spot on Ally McBeal was reportedly cut short by creator-producer David E. Kelley after the latest incident, was released last August and appeared on magazine covers under headlines like 'Mr. Clean'. For Downey, however, rehab was not the magic cure that many believe it to be. Neither was it for Aaron Sorkin, the 39-year-old creator of the White House drama The West Wing. After kicking a cocaine addiction five years ago - for which he received an 'award' from the Phoenix House substance abuse recovery centre - Sorkin was arrested on 15 April at Burbank Airport for possession of magic mushrooms and marijuana. Whether it's cocaine, as with Downey and Sorkin, or painkillers such as Vicodin (Perry's addiction, which earlier this year forced him from the set of his movie Servicing Sarah and away from taping Friends), it appears that the real difficulty is not getting stars to acknowledge they have a problem - after all, drug counsellors are now a common sight on TV and movie sets. The more serious issue is whether stars can ever get out of the spiral of addiction when surrounded by a culture as frenzied as Hollywood's. 'In the creative world, where at the end of a day or at the end of a gig there's this tremendous letdown when the work is done, there's this compulsion to retrieve something of that,' says Porter. 'Cocaine is a drug that's much more geared toward the creative process. You can go for days and have the illusion that you're sharp and everything you say is brilliant and you can maybe produce more, so cocaine is the perfect drug for the entertainment business.' The town's culture of contrition requires a brief bit of lip-chewing, and the now-obligatory stay in a cushy rehab centre after which the assumption sets in that everything is fine. What this cycle doesn't make room for is the work: lawyers often draft contractual agreements, sometimes including monetary carrots, to keep stars clean. One such case is Charlie Sheen's contract for Spin City, which states that the former addict loses out on bonuses if he relapses into his old ways. 'Downey's problems required him to be recast in this summer's romantic comedy America's Sweethearts, but often on movies there's simply a break in the action for a bit,' says Dade Hayes, who covers the film industry for Variety . While all aspects of the industry have felt the negative effect of stars' drug problems, the television industry has an inordinate amount of actors and actresses who fall prey to addiction. 'In television, the workload is so much more demanding, so gruelling for months at a time, that drugs may be a way to cope, whereas on a film you lose a little bit of time, but it can be spaced out a bit,' says Hayes. The problem is not always properly addressed, he adds, because producers 'might not want to mess with a good thing, at least not to the extent that it would compromise their earnings.' Yet if the star's behaviour goes unchecked there are inevitable consequences. 'A star who has a substance abuse problem is a terrorist to all of the people he or she works with,' according to a former producer of Home Improvement, which continued for eight seasons despite star Tim Allen's alcohol problems in the Nineties. 'They are held hostage because the star ultimately determines the course of every day.' Downey's latest run-in with the law caused David E. Kelley to issue a statement saying: 'We are wrapping up the stories on the final few episodes of Ally McBeal for the season without him.' Actors reportedly had to shoot alternative scenes and some dialogue was changed to accommodate his absence. 'Fifteen years ago, cocaine was romanticised. It's not that way now,' says Porter. 'And yet they still don't know how to treat it. All the rehab centres are basically aimed at heroin users. Which is a problem, but it's only part of the problem.' 'I have found a remarkable degree of tolerance on the part of movie producers,' says Hayes. 'It's like a complete slap in the face to the attitude that Hollywood has taken in public. 'It's interesting - in sports there's a sense of exasperation when an athlete falls repeatedly to drugs. In the entertainment industry, people are more than willing to give abusers second, third, fourth chances.' But is that ultimately damaging their product? When so much money goes into marketing a film and a star's personal problems upstage the multi-million-dollar product, one would think substance and alcohol abuse would be given a firmer reprimand.

So they have decided to sell their house in London and move to the south coast.</p> <p>'We thought we had better make our escape now before Bronte started school,' explains Jenny.</p> <p>They are looking for a property around Southampton or Southsea where they will be able to get more for their money than in London. Dominic has found a job in the area and his new employer is paying the relocation costs.</p> <p>They would like to remortgage at the same time but are locked in with their current lender by a hefty redemption penalty. Nevertheless their lender, Alliance &amp; Leicester, has agreed to them switching to a flexible mortgage without penalty, and Jenny hopes they will eventually be able to start paying off chunks of their loan early.</p> <p>Their current repayment method is an Allied Dunbar endowment but they have been told it will probably not pay off the loan in full. She wonders how best to proceed with the endowment.</p> <p>The one downside of their move is that Jenny will have to give up her well-paid part-time nursing job organising organ transplants. Although she does not envisage having too many problems finding a new job, she doubts she will earn as much and it may take several months to organise. During the intervening period, they expect to have to dip into their \u00a38,000 savings, in a Northern Rock instant access account.</p> <p>Another consequence will be a further gap in her pension contributions. Her pension is one of her prime concerns - and regrets. She admits: 'I rather naively opted out of the NHS pension scheme in my earlier twenties. I didn't see any harm at the time as I was intending to go abroad to work.' She rejoined about seven years ago and converted the private pension she had begun into a free-standing AVC scheme. However, the arrival of children meant her pension contributions went down again when she started working part-time.</p> <p>Still, she and Dominic have invested about \u00a318,000 in Isas linked to funds such as Norwich Union European, Henderson Global Technology and Fidelity's UK Aggressive.</p> <p>They are contributing a further \u00a3100 a month to a Gartmore Isa and Jenny has started an investment trust savings plan for \u00a320 a month with Edinburgh Fund Managers. These investments are mainly intended for the future financial security of the children. She realises she has chosen high-risk funds but feels that over the next 15 years they will come good.</p> <p>Although she is concerned about her children's financial security, she admits she is unsure how much life cover she and Dominic have apart from the cover Dominic gets with his pension scheme.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 1:Sharon Linnard</strong></p> <p>The penalty-free switch to Alliance &amp; Leicester's flexible mortgage is useful for the short term, but it would be worth checking alternative offers when penalties cease to apply.</p> <p>Early surrender of endowments offers poor value, and there is no second-hand market for unit-linked contracts, such as that with Allied Dunbar. </p> <p>It may be worth simply discontinuing premiums and accepting a lower policy value with the mortgage split, part endowment/part repayment. Penalties on surrender or premium cessation need to be explored.</p> <p>Turning to Jenny's pension concerns, the new stakeholder pension rules mean that she could continue contributing up to \u00a3300 a month gross to a pension while she is between jobs. When she starts work again, a stakeholder pension can be maintained alongside any occupational scheme, providing she does not earn over \u00a330,000 a year.</p> <p>As Jenny says, their Isa savings are in relatively high-risk funds. The recovery of technology funds could take a considerable time but, in the event of a partial recovery, perhaps at least a proportion of the holding could be switched to a different sector.</p> <p>For peace of mind, the couple should consider taking out a term assurance policy: it may be possible to purchase death cover of \u00a3100,000 each over a 15-year term for no more than \u00a323 a month.</p> <p>Sharon Linnard works for chartered accountants KPMG.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 2: Dan Kemp</strong></p> <p>It is important that Jenny look at whether she is making the best use of her additional pension contributions.

'We had to watch every single penny,' says Allan, who is now 49. </p> <p>But they were quite capable of living frugally. Both come from poor families on housing estates in small towns. They are both vegetarian, non-smokers, non-drinkers and not great spenders. </p> <p>They then started thinking of ways to bring in money again - and this lead to more books - on communications, the difference between the sexes and the art of persuasion. </p> <p>Why Men Don't Listen... gives all sorts of insights into male and female differences - why men do not like getting advice, for instance, why only 1 per cent of international air pilots are female, why women are more tuned into sympathy and empathy than men, and 300 pages of ideas. </p> <p>The inspiration for the book came when Barbara hit Allan over the head with a map while they were having the classic marital driving and navigation row in Italy. They then started to document the spark points for male-female conflict. </p> <p>In their own marriage, they are very conscious of the gender differences. On money, for instance, Barbara - a 38-year-old who had planned to become an accountant but became a model instead - watches their finances day to day and brings Allan in when they both need to take a view of the bigger picture. 'Most men are not particularly good at the fine detail. If she ever leaves me, I'll be buggered,' he says with a big laugh.</p> <p>But men are also happier at taking risks, he says: 'The whole evolution of men is based on taking risks - going over the horizon to face the unknown.' </p> <p>However, they are not planning to take too many risks with their money now. 'Last year we bought into shares,' says Barbara. 'But this year we are going to sit tight on the shares we have.' </p> <p>They own three large houses in England and Australia, and are going to cut back on the huge amounts of work they have put in during the past few years. </p> <p>'We are going to start yoga and meditation,' he says. Barbara adds: 'We'll walk the dog and ride the horses and go for lots of beach walking at our new house in Australia.</p>",

Why Men Don't Listen... gives all sorts of insights into male and female differences - why men do not like getting advice, for instance, why only 1 per cent of international air pilots are female, why women are more tuned into sympathy and empathy than men, and 300 pages of ideas. The inspiration for the book came when Barbara hit Allan over the head with a map while they were having the classic marital driving and navigation row in Italy. They then started to document the spark points for male-female conflict. In their own marriage, they are very conscious of the gender differences. On money, for instance, Barbara - a 38-year-old who had planned to become an accountant but became a model instead - watches their finances day to day and brings Allan in when they both need to take a view of the bigger picture. 'Most men are not particularly good at the fine detail. If she ever leaves me, I'll be buggered,' he says with a big laugh. But men are also happier at taking risks, he says: 'The whole evolution of men is based on taking risks - going over the horizon to face the unknown.' However, they are not planning to take too many risks with their money now. 'Last year we bought into shares,' says Barbara. 'But this year we are going to sit tight on the shares we have.' They own three large houses in England and Australia, and are going to cut back on the huge amounts of work they have put in during the past few years. 'We are going to start yoga and meditation,' he says. Barbara adds: 'We'll walk the dog and ride the horses and go for lots of beach walking at our new house in Australia.",

This opened the door to Scottish Power. </p> <p>A City source said Portland, which sells power to 725,000 customers in and around the state capital of Oregon, would be a perfect fit for the Pacificorp business in the north-west US, which Scottish bought in 1999 for \u00a34.7bn. Scottish has consistently said it wants to build up its business in the US. </p> <p>PacifiCorp has some 1.5m residential, commercial and industrial customers spread over six states: Oregon, California, Washington, Wyoming, Utah and Idaho. </p> <p>'Portland sits in the middle of PacifiCorp territory in Oregon,' he said. 'There would be added customers and big synergies in infrastructure, operations, and head office functions. It would make sense.' </p> <p>Scottish Power's management will be quizzed about the move when it sets out its strategy in the UK and US at a results meeting this week. </p> <p>There have been concerns over PacifiCorp after the shutdown of the Hunter power plant in Utah forced the company to buy in electricity at prices vastly inflated by the California power shortage.

      "bodyText": "Utility giant Scottish Power is considering a move to bolster its American West Coast operations by swooping on Oregon's Portland General in a deal that could total $3bn (\u00a32.17bn). Portland's owner, Enron, last week broke off talks with US utility Sierra Pacific over a deal said to be worth $3.1bn. This opened the door to Scottish Power. A City source said Portland, which sells power to 725,000 customers in and around the state capital of Oregon, would be a perfect fit for the Pacificorp business in the north-west US, which Scottish bought in 1999 for \u00a34.7bn. Scottish has consistently said it wants to build up its business in the US. PacifiCorp has some 1.5m residential, commercial and industrial customers spread over six states: Oregon, California, Washington, Wyoming, Utah and Idaho. 'Portland sits in the middle of PacifiCorp territory in Oregon,' he said. 'There would be added customers and big synergies in infrastructure, operations, and head office functions. It would make sense.' Scottish Power's management will be quizzed about the move when it sets out its strategy in the UK and US at a results meeting this week. There have been concerns over PacifiCorp after the shutdown of the Hunter power plant in Utah forced the company to buy in electricity at prices vastly inflated by the California power shortage. The problem cost Scottish Power \u00a3160 million in the first nine months of last year. It would also come up against regulatory issues if it embarked on a bid. Earnings from PacifiCorp are expected to come in at around \u00a3349m before exceptionals. Peter Atherton, utilities analyst at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, said: 'I would expect Scottish Power to be looking very closely at PGE, given their stated strategy of adding to their PacifiCorp assets.' \u0095 Analysts will also be keen on a progress report on the sale of Southern Water, valued at \u00a31.7bn with \u00a31bn of debt, on Thursday. They are expecting pre-tax profits to fall from \u00a3737m last year to \u00a3616m this.",

A \u00a330bn debt mountain has raised huge questions over BT's future and the City has been baying for management blood as the price of stumping up \u00a35bn for a rights issue - the largest in UK corporate history. </p> <p>So far the City has secured the scalp of BT managing director Bill Cockburn and the somewhat sedate defenestration of Bland's predecessor, Sir Iain Vallance, who now assumes the lofty but meaningless title of president emeritus. </p> <p>Whether the Square Mile loses its blood lust depends on whether Bland can improve the beleaguered company's lot. </p> <p>Many would like to see the shooting fanatic kick off his new day job with a full-scale review of the BT management board. Despite his reputation as a fixer rather than a politician Bland's riposte is a study in measured response. 'There won't be a review with a capital R, but I can't think of any organisation in which you don't look at management structure on a continuous basis. But the implication that everything is perfect would also be misleading.' </p> <p>Commentators and analysts alike have lined up to call for more executive directors to be added to the company's board in a bid to help the behemoth think up some fresh ideas. Bland seems open to this. </p> <p>'They've got what I would describe as a more American structure, with only two executives now. That is Peter [Bonfield, the chief executive] and Philip [Hampton, the newish finance director]. My own instinct is to see how it works and if it needs to be changed I and the board will talk about it.' </p> <p>And then there are some who point out that BT's restructuring plan, announced last year and described by Bonfield as 'no less dramatic in its way than the original privatisation back in 1984', is no longer viable. The aim was to split the company into five discrete divisions, some of which would be floated off, others demerged. </p> <p>But as the City has fallen out of love with the telecoms sector and values have crashed many doubt whether such a plan is feasible. When asked whether market developments had evolved, Bland breaks into a laugh and says: 'That's a very pious way of putting it. It's what Macmillan called \"events dear boy, events\".' </p> <p>Bland hints that such a plan will need to be reviewed once he is settled at the company's Newgate Street HQ. 'That's something you keep under continuous review, but I don't start at BT until Tuesday morning. I've seen quite a lot of various board papers and a great deal of restructuring analysis has been done. I don't think any alternative hasn't been looked at in some detail. I think the way forward is coalescing and part of my job is to finalise that coalescing process.' </p> <p>This seems an understated way of admitting that part of his new job will be to beat BT into shape. The over-riding criticism of the company is that it is overly bureaucratic, stupefied by a civil service mentality that means decisions take months to evolve. </p> <p>Certainly Bland's reputation for cutting out the deadwood at logistics group NFC is legendary. There have obviously been similar challenges at the BBC, where the jury is still out on his performance. </p> <p>Bland argues that, like Aunty, BT has in the past suffered at the hands of watchdogs. 'Dealing with regulators ad infinitum ad nauseum is something that imposes a great deal of bureaucratic process upon you, so I have some sympathy with any organisation where external forces are involved. But, like NFC, BT came out of a denationalised organisation and the quirks and behaviour patterns built up over many years. If it's bureaucratic, we should streamline and simplify.' </p> <p>Some wonder whether Bland, born in 1938, has the ability to really transform the company, a task that many believe will take years, if not light years, to complete. The day his appointment was announced BT's shares slid 5%. David Manning, at fund manager Foreign &amp; Colonial, said: 'Bland's age is a disappointment. It would have been better if they had gone for someone in their early fifties who could be there for the long term. But having anyone fresh as chairman means there will be more options possible - you should never underestimate the options that can open up.' </p> <p>Indeed, Bland does seem prepared to rip up the rule book and start again. 'Part of my value as chairman is that I come with a fresh and uncluttered perspective, so there isn't anything that is unthinkable.' </p> <p>But what about the critics who argue he doesn't have a telecoms' background? Bland points out this hasn't helped some of the experts. 'I would ask the critics why all the big telecom groups around the world are in what one might politely call difficulties.' </p> <p>Possible clues to BT's future could lie in LWT's past. 'At London Weekend, when I became chairman, we had a travel business, a technology business, a publishing business and we got out of those pretty quickly.

The other issue was that I was very clear if I was going to BT I would have to go very speedily. You either had to do it now or not at all. But if you did it now that would impose pressures on the BBC.' </p> <p>And, of course, this is not something Aunty wants to worry about just before an election. The loss of Tory-supporting Bland - seen as a political counter-weight to Labour-leaning Director-General Greg Dyke - at such a crucial time rocked Westminster. </p> <p>'It would suit me personally, if I had no honour, to walk out of the BBC on Monday night, but that would be totally unfair to my colleagues.' The solution is a stop-gap measure that sees Bland juggling both jobs until after the general election. 'I'm absolutely clear that this is less than ideal for both organisations, but it is bearable for a short period.' </p> <p>Once the solution was given the green light from both Number 10 and William Hague, Bland decided to combine the two roles for the next few weeks. 'It is possible for short periods to work six or seven days a week. It's quite exhilarating sometimes, but you don't want to do it for ever.' Vallance might have said the same thing about BT.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It may not seem a very radical step for a firm to put 'Group plc' after its name, but when stockbroker Cazenove does that tomorrow, it will signal the end of an era in City history and usher in a new world for the illustrious firm known as Caz. </p> <p>Life behind the highly polished glass and wooden doors at 2 Tokenhouse Yard may, on the surface, carry on as usual. The butlers will still guide their clients up the oak staircase, past portraits of great Caz stockbrokers of the past. Caz executives will still have the firmest of handshakes and the stiffest of upper lips. But everything will have changed. </p> <p>The decision to incorporate is the biggest gamble Caz has taken in its 177-year history. Hitherto, it has been a partnership, with all the benefits that brings: huge financial rewards, lack of public scrutiny and unity of purpose. An expert on City matters, former top financier turned author Philip Augur, summed it up: 'Cazenove was well-connected, powerful, discreet bordering on the secretive, and with an effortless style. It was gentlemanly capitalism in corporate form.' </p> <p>The Caz set-up enabled the firm to sail through crises that would have ruined others. Unlike almost every other City blue-blood, Caz stayed out of the mad free-for-all of Big Bang, preferring to stay independent with the financial backing of its wealthiest City clients. Its best business-winner of the Eighties, David Mayhew, was at the heart of the Guinness affair, which destroyed many a City reputation, yet the firm stood by him. Tomorrow, he becomes chairman of the new company. </p> <p>The partnership structure enabled Caz to flourish financially. In a world dominated by the 'bulge bracket' - Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs - Caz remains the pre-eminent UK corporate stockbroker, regu larly near the top of performance league tables. It has gained increasing business in corporate advisory work.

      "bodyText": "It may not seem a very radical step for a firm to put 'Group plc' after its name, but when stockbroker Cazenove does that tomorrow, it will signal the end of an era in City history and usher in a new world for the illustrious firm known as Caz. Life behind the highly polished glass and wooden doors at 2 Tokenhouse Yard may, on the surface, carry on as usual. The butlers will still guide their clients up the oak staircase, past portraits of great Caz stockbrokers of the past. Caz executives will still have the firmest of handshakes and the stiffest of upper lips. But everything will have changed. The decision to incorporate is the biggest gamble Caz has taken in its 177-year history. Hitherto, it has been a partnership, with all the benefits that brings: huge financial rewards, lack of public scrutiny and unity of purpose. An expert on City matters, former top financier turned author Philip Augur, summed it up: 'Cazenove was well-connected, powerful, discreet bordering on the secretive, and with an effortless style. It was gentlemanly capitalism in corporate form.' The Caz set-up enabled the firm to sail through crises that would have ruined others. Unlike almost every other City blue-blood, Caz stayed out of the mad free-for-all of Big Bang, preferring to stay independent with the financial backing of its wealthiest City clients. Its best business-winner of the Eighties, David Mayhew, was at the heart of the Guinness affair, which destroyed many a City reputation, yet the firm stood by him. Tomorrow, he becomes chairman of the new company. The partnership structure enabled Caz to flourish financially. In a world dominated by the 'bulge bracket' - Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs - Caz remains the pre-eminent UK corporate stockbroker, regu larly near the top of performance league tables. It has gained increasing business in corporate advisory work. It is involved in serious fee-taking in three of the biggest corporate shows in town: the Bank of Scotland/Halifax merger, and the restructurings of Marks &amp; Spencer and BT. So, the first question must be: why change a winning formula? The answer is that the game has changed. The big global investment banks that fight Caz for business on a daily basis dwarf the London firm. If the market puts a value of around $2bn on Caz when it floats 18 months from now, that still pales beside Goldman Sachs, at around $44bn, or Merrill Lynch, at $52bn. A market listing will give it access to capital, but will also enable it to remunerate its star players with something much more tangible than the promise of a partnership in the distant future: equity. Caz will have to pay to retain the young stars who are not content to wait for their goodies, especially when - in the good times - the Americans are throwing shares around. So incorporation represents an opportunity to drag the firm into the twenty-first century, and grow the business along orthodox investment banking lines. Organisationally, Caz now looks much like a typical US outfit: a mainstay corporate advisory business, accompanied by traditional strengths in corporate stockbroking and a relatively new research-based equities business. It also has the normal bolt-on businesses of asset management and private equity. There are ambitious plans to continue the overseas expansion that has been a feature of recent years. But there are great risks attached to incorporation, which is why Caz executives, under joint managing directors Nigel Rowe and Robert Pickering, have planned the move so painstakingly and for so long.

There was disbelief when orders for four naval ferries went to Germany last January.

This is not just because Germany's most northerly large town lacks the charms of Lanzarote or Malaga. </p> <p>Flensburg has become something of a nemesis to British manufacturing. US electronics company Motorola chose to shut its profitable Bathgate factory in Scotland instead of its lossmaking German one. In January Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon announced that four roll-on roll-off ferries for the navy were to be built at the town's Shiffbau-Gesellschaft shipyard. </p> <p>Flensburg (pop 88,000), has a trading history dating from the thirteenth century. Since it voted in a 1920 plebiscite to be part of Germany, it has been an important maritime site, boasting a naval station and academy since before the Second World War.

      "bodyText": "Ask a British shipyard worker or mobile phone producer where he is going for his summer holidays and Flensburg is unlikely to top the list. This is not just because Germany's most northerly large town lacks the charms of Lanzarote or Malaga. Flensburg has become something of a nemesis to British manufacturing. US electronics company Motorola chose to shut its profitable Bathgate factory in Scotland instead of its lossmaking German one. In January Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon announced that four roll-on roll-off ferries for the navy were to be built at the town's Shiffbau-Gesellschaft shipyard. Flensburg (pop 88,000), has a trading history dating from the thirteenth century. Since it voted in a 1920 plebiscite to be part of Germany, it has been an important maritime site, boasting a naval station and academy since before the Second World War. Today its industries include shipbuilding, metalworking, and paper-milling, along with the more refined practices of rum and smoked eel production. But what does Flensburg have that UK shipyards or phone plants don't? Its workforce is well paid. It enjoys exactly those social entitlements, labour laws and union influence that UK companies and business lobby groups argue would undermine British competitiveness. But UK union officials believe the more co-operative regime helps rather than hinders inward investment. They believe the town's success owes much to its interventionist state government.

The top-down globalisation is characterised by a constant drive to maximise profits for globe-spanning corporations.

The great spiritual leaders of all cultures have been clear that the best path in life does not consist of amassing material goods. Jesus used violence only once, against a specific occupation - not Roman soldiers or tax collectors - but bankers. Paul of Tarsus said: 'The love of money is the root of all evil.' Confucius said: 'The superior person knows what is right; the inferior person knows what will sell.' Even George Soros, the billionaire financier, admits: 'Markets basically are amoral.'</p> <p>Here in the United States, large sections of the public are increasingly critical of corporate rule and its consequences. A recent business magazine survey revealed that 74 per cent of the public believe big corporations have too much power, and 73 per cent believe top executives get paid too much; 95 per cent of those polled agreed with the following statement: 'US corporations should have more than one purpose. They also owe something to their workers and the communities in which they operate, and they should sometimes sacrifice some profit for the sake of making things better for their workers and communities.'</p> <p>Let's be clear about the 'free market'. It is an ideological construct that does not exist in reality. All the countries that successfully industrialised did so through state intervention, with government playing an active role in directing investment, managing trade and subsidising chosen sectors of the economy.</p> <p>The temple of democracy has been taken over in recent decades by the transnational money-changers. Large corporations dominate national governments and they dominate the secret global government (the World Trade Organisation, World Bank, International Monetary Fund etc) that is being constructed behind the backs of citizens. This explains why the rulers need to hide their rule-making procedures: if less than 1 per cent of the population (millionaire corporate lawyers) monopolise the rule-making process, they can't let the public know the details.</p> <p>Would the policies of these global bodies be kept so secret if they were really in the public interest. Wouldn't the corporate lawyers want to debate openly with us opponents of corporate globalisation and prove their claims that we don't know what we're talking about? Yet getting these global financial bodies to debate in public is like pulling teeth.</p> <p>We are now experiencing 'a constitutional moment'. Corporate interests are writing a global constitution that elevates corporate profit-making above the rights of citizens to protect their jobs and the environment. Whether the rule-making takes place in the WTO, the IMF or in planning the coming free-trade area of the Americas, the only people with a seat at the table represent transnational corporate interests.</p> <p>If workers, small businesses, non-profit groups and environmentalists are not represented when the rules get written, then their interests will be subordinated to those of corporate profit-making. Look around and you will see mounting symptoms. The world economy produces more food per capita than ever before, yet we have more hungry people than ever before.</p> <p>The environmental crisis is evident in eroding topsoil, poisoned ground water, melting glaciers, receding icecaps at the poles, a depleted ozone layer, the build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and unsustainable patterns of resource consumption. In turn, these crises are producing a moral crisis in which the affluent avert their eyes and pretend there is no crisis.</p> <p>In the cities of rich countries around the world, in Seattle, Quebec, London, protesters rage against an economy that turns every living thing into dead money. These protests are the beginning of a movement that puts love of life above love of money. If it is true that 'nature always bats last', then the world view that seeks to ride with nature will outlast the world view that seeks to dominate it and turn it into money.</p> <p>\u0095 Find details of the author's work on globalism at <a href=\"http://www.globalexchange.org\">www.globalexchange.org</a></p> <p><b>More special reports from Guardian Unlimited</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/global\">The globalisation debate - Observer special</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday\">Special report: Mayday</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/globalisation/\">Special report: globalisation</a></p>",

Confucius said: 'The superior person knows what is right; the inferior person knows what will sell.' Even George Soros, the billionaire financier, admits: 'Markets basically are amoral.' Here in the United States, large sections of the public are increasingly critical of corporate rule and its consequences. A recent business magazine survey revealed that 74 per cent of the public believe big corporations have too much power, and 73 per cent believe top executives get paid too much; 95 per cent of those polled agreed with the following statement: 'US corporations should have more than one purpose. They also owe something to their workers and the communities in which they operate, and they should sometimes sacrifice some profit for the sake of making things better for their workers and communities.' Let's be clear about the 'free market'. It is an ideological construct that does not exist in reality. All the countries that successfully industrialised did so through state intervention, with government playing an active role in directing investment, managing trade and subsidising chosen sectors of the economy. The temple of democracy has been taken over in recent decades by the transnational money-changers. Large corporations dominate national governments and they dominate the secret global government (the World Trade Organisation, World Bank, International Monetary Fund etc) that is being constructed behind the backs of citizens. This explains why the rulers need to hide their rule-making procedures: if less than 1 per cent of the population (millionaire corporate lawyers) monopolise the rule-making process, they can't let the public know the details. Would the policies of these global bodies be kept so secret if they were really in the public interest. Wouldn't the corporate lawyers want to debate openly with us opponents of corporate globalisation and prove their claims that we don't know what we're talking about? Yet getting these global financial bodies to debate in public is like pulling teeth. We are now experiencing 'a constitutional moment'. Corporate interests are writing a global constitution that elevates corporate profit-making above the rights of citizens to protect their jobs and the environment. Whether the rule-making takes place in the WTO, the IMF or in planning the coming free-trade area of the Americas, the only people with a seat at the table represent transnational corporate interests. If workers, small businesses, non-profit groups and environmentalists are not represented when the rules get written, then their interests will be subordinated to those of corporate profit-making. Look around and you will see mounting symptoms. The world economy produces more food per capita than ever before, yet we have more hungry people than ever before. The environmental crisis is evident in eroding topsoil, poisoned ground water, melting glaciers, receding icecaps at the poles, a depleted ozone layer, the build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and unsustainable patterns of resource consumption. In turn, these crises are producing a moral crisis in which the affluent avert their eyes and pretend there is no crisis. In the cities of rich countries around the world, in Seattle, Quebec, London, protesters rage against an economy that turns every living thing into dead money. These protests are the beginning of a movement that puts love of life above love of money. If it is true that 'nature always bats last', then the world view that seeks to ride with nature will outlast the world view that seeks to dominate it and turn it into money. \u0095 Find details of the author's work on globalism at www.globalexchange.org More special reports from Guardian Unlimited The globalisation debate - Observer special Special report: Mayday Special report: globalisation",
