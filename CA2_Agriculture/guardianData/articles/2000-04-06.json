The singers wear modern clothes, and Tom Pye's set is minimal - a couple of benches, some stark wooden pillars used for Christ's scourging and crucifixion.

There is much aimless wandering around the stage by the chorus, many anguished expressions, much metaphorical wringing of hands. </p> <p>After Christ's death, it loses even that balance. The chorus strew bunches of flowers and someone brings on a lamb, which is placed in the Evangelist's arms during the final chorale. It's a tacky idea to begin with, but on the first night the animal bleated, as lambs tend to do; the audience sniggered, and the performance ended with none of the rapt seriousness it should have generated. </p> <p>Until that unfortunate point Padmore's contribution had been the centre around which the rest had revolved, delivering the recitative (in Neil Jenkins's antiquely biblical translation) with maximum meaning and effortless purity of tone; it would be a glorious performance in any context. Paul Whelan's Jesus is noble and forthright too, but none of the singers in the solo arias are crisp enough, and the ENO chorus regularly reveal their lack of specialist baroque expertise, even though Layton and an orchestra that nicely balances period instrument and modern approaches set them a fine example. Overall it's just not good enough. </p> <p>\u0095 In repertory until April 22. Box office: 0171 632 8300</p> <p>***** Unmissable **** Recommended *** Enjoyable ** Mediocre * Terrible</p>",

There is much aimless wandering around the stage by the chorus, many anguished expressions, much metaphorical wringing of hands. After Christ's death, it loses even that balance. The chorus strew bunches of flowers and someone brings on a lamb, which is placed in the Evangelist's arms during the final chorale. It's a tacky idea to begin with, but on the first night the animal bleated, as lambs tend to do; the audience sniggered, and the performance ended with none of the rapt seriousness it should have generated. Until that unfortunate point Padmore's contribution had been the centre around which the rest had revolved, delivering the recitative (in Neil Jenkins's antiquely biblical translation) with maximum meaning and effortless purity of tone; it would be a glorious performance in any context. Paul Whelan's Jesus is noble and forthright too, but none of the singers in the solo arias are crisp enough, and the ENO chorus regularly reveal their lack of specialist baroque expertise, even though Layton and an orchestra that nicely balances period instrument and modern approaches set them a fine example. Overall it's just not good enough. \u0095 In repertory until April 22. Box office: 0171 632 8300 ***** Unmissable **** Recommended *** Enjoyable ** Mediocre * Terrible",

The prince, one of the world's most prolific private investors, said the slide in hi-tech stocks had presented him with \"a historic moment to seize\". He has been mopping up AOL shares for the past six months and also announced a $400m investment in computer firm Compaq and $100m each in Eastman Kodak and office equipment firm Xerox. Shares in AOL, which is in the process of acquiring the American multi-media business Time Warner, reached a peak of more than $95 at the end of last year but were trading yesterday at $65, having climbed 4%. Prince Alwaleed's stake is still less than 1% of AOL, which is valued at almost $150bn. The investor is well known for his ability to spot value in companies when they are weathering difficult conditions. He has demonstrated a perceptive sense of timing in recent years, buying large stakes in property group Canary Wharf and EuroDisney when both were regarded as expensive follies. He has built up a reported fortune of $15bn and is ranked at number eight on the Forbes rich list. \"The right timing and the right entry price is very crucial,\" he said, citing the example of Apple Computer, which he bought into at $18 a share and now trades at around $132. Prince Alwaleed said he had chosen his latest investments because they were strong international brands with potential for growth which had been \"hammered\" recently, as distinct from the sea of dot.com companies riding the bull market. \"Some of these companies will survive but they cannot survive with these high flying, crazy prices.

Next to the microphone were the artist Humphrey Ocean, a friend of Dury's from art school days and from his early band, Kilburn and the High Roads, and Chas Smash from \"that Kilburns tribute band\", Madness.

He alone is responsible for the debate that will follow. This year's topic will be how Moody, worthy cricketer though he may be, gets the nod over Andy Caddick. But as for the cricketers of the century, that is another matter, requiring collective responsibility. </p> <p>So Engel constructed an electorate - membership of 100, naturally, three of whom were women - comprising an international body of cricketers, commentators, writers, journalists and historians, with each of the Test-playing countries represented according, roughly, to the number of Tests it played during the past century. </p> <p>Thus there were 28 from England, followed by Australia (20), down to Dave Houghton, the single Zimbabwean representative. Obvious candidates were not invited for equally obvious reasons. </p> <p>Each then nominated his or her five candidates, occasionally giving reasons although not compelled to do so, and Engel gleefully counted them up. The result was like rollover week in the lottery, with no one nominating all of the top five. Yet as Engel says, no one surely will suggest that they have got it terribly wrong, with at least one of the five playing in each decade of the century and a neat geographical spread of two Australians, two West Indians and an Englishman. </p> <p>Some of it was easy. No prizes for guessing Bradman, of course, for whom the voting was unanimous. </p> <p>Nor really for Sobers, either, although 10% of the electorate clearly thought there were four others more worthy. This pair were streets ahead of the opposition. </p> <p>Below that it started to get tighter, although Hobbs, Warne and Richards were still significantly ahead of the next qualifiers, Dennis Lillee, Sir Frank Worrell, Walter Hammond, Denis Compton, Sir Richard Hadlee (voted for by his father Walter, among others) and Imran Khan. </p> <p>A further 38 cricketers received one or more votes, which, if nothing else, illustrates the difficulty with over sized selection committees. </p> <p>On a personal note it is disappointing that I did not make the final five, although solace is gained in the fact that I received only one vote fewer than Michael Holding, Allan Donald and Curtly Ambrose, and precisely the same number as Brian Lara, Greg Chappell and Barry Richards. </p> <p> (Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 2000, editor Matthew Engel, publisher John Wisden and Co Ltd, \u00a329.99) </p> <p><strong>Wisden's famous five of the century</strong></p> <p> <strong> 1 Sir Donald Bradman</strong> Australian batsman, 100 votes. \"The greatest phenomenon in the history of cricket, indeed in the history of all ball games,\" writes Wisden, and who can argue with a Test average of 99.94 runs per innings. His appetite for runs was never sated. </p> <p> <strong> 5 Sir Vivian Richards</strong> West Indies batsman, 25 votes. Swaggeringly dominant, awesomely powerful and quite probably the most destructive batsman the game has seen. Scorer of the fastest Test century, from 56 balls. </p> <p> <strong> 2 Sir Garfield Sobers</strong> West Indies all-rounder, 90 votes. The best left-handed batsman of them all, he could bowl searingly fast left-arm, swing the ball wickedly, and then turn to left-arm spin, either orthodox or wrist. Who didn't vote for him and why? </p> <p> <strong> 4 Shane Warne</strong> Australian wrist spinner, 27 votes. One delivery, to Mike Gatting - the first of his opening spell in Ashes cricket - elevated him to legendary status. Resurrected the art of spin bowling in Tests when it seemed lost forever to the fast men. </p> <p> <strong> 3 Sir Jack Hobbs</strong> England batsman, 30 votes. The Master, scorer of more first-class runs - 61,237 - and more centuries - 197, 98 of them after his 40th birthday - than any other. \"Lifted the status and dignity of the English professional cricketer,\" says Wisden</p>",

Yet as Engel says, no one surely will suggest that they have got it terribly wrong, with at least one of the five playing in each decade of the century and a neat geographical spread of two Australians, two West Indians and an Englishman. Some of it was easy. No prizes for guessing Bradman, of course, for whom the voting was unanimous. Nor really for Sobers, either, although 10% of the electorate clearly thought there were four others more worthy. This pair were streets ahead of the opposition. Below that it started to get tighter, although Hobbs, Warne and Richards were still significantly ahead of the next qualifiers, Dennis Lillee, Sir Frank Worrell, Walter Hammond, Denis Compton, Sir Richard Hadlee (voted for by his father Walter, among others) and Imran Khan. A further 38 cricketers received one or more votes, which, if nothing else, illustrates the difficulty with over sized selection committees. On a personal note it is disappointing that I did not make the final five, although solace is gained in the fact that I received only one vote fewer than Michael Holding, Allan Donald and Curtly Ambrose, and precisely the same number as Brian Lara, Greg Chappell and Barry Richards. (Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 2000, editor Matthew Engel, publisher John Wisden and Co Ltd, \u00a329.99) Wisden's famous five of the century 1 Sir Donald Bradman Australian batsman, 100 votes. \"The greatest phenomenon in the history of cricket, indeed in the history of all ball games,\" writes Wisden, and who can argue with a Test average of 99.94 runs per innings. His appetite for runs was never sated. 5 Sir Vivian Richards West Indies batsman, 25 votes. Swaggeringly dominant, awesomely powerful and quite probably the most destructive batsman the game has seen. Scorer of the fastest Test century, from 56 balls. 2 Sir Garfield Sobers West Indies all-rounder, 90 votes. The best left-handed batsman of them all, he could bowl searingly fast left-arm, swing the ball wickedly, and then turn to left-arm spin, either orthodox or wrist. Who didn't vote for him and why? 4 Shane Warne Australian wrist spinner, 27 votes. One delivery, to Mike Gatting - the first of his opening spell in Ashes cricket - elevated him to legendary status. Resurrected the art of spin bowling in Tests when it seemed lost forever to the fast men. 3 Sir Jack Hobbs England batsman, 30 votes. The Master, scorer of more first-class runs - 61,237 - and more centuries - 197, 98 of them after his 40th birthday - than any other. \"Lifted the status and dignity of the English professional cricketer,\" says Wisden",

A long ball over the top from Petit finds Bergkamp at full pelt meeting two bemused and flat-footed fullbacks. Warmuz in goal is forced to come out but the Dutchman calmly flicks it past him on the right and slots the half-volley home from 20 yards. A great start for the home side.<br><strong>5</strong> Lens are looking a little shell-shocked, and are losing possession in midfield to Vieira and Petit.<br><strong>9</strong> Silvinho breaks down the left wing and plays in a peach of a cross onto Kanu's head - he doesn't have to move - but from seven yards out the big Nigerian nods the ball straight at Warmuz, who makes the save whether he likes it or not.<br><strong>12</strong> Kanu, perhaps fed up of missing sitters, turns provider on the right, slinging in a low cross that Bergkamp was readying himself to convert on the edge of the six-yard box. A last-minute interception from Coly saves the day for Lens. A corner results, but is easily cleared.<br><strong>16</strong> Petit spots Overmars on the left, in space. The winger plays a first-time cross-shot hybrid that Warmuz smothers in front of his goal.<br><strong>18</strong> Kanu is displaying the full array of his abilities in missing good chances tonight. This time a cross from Silvinho is nodded into the welcoming arms of Warmuz from over the penalty spot. Arsenal are winning a lot of ball in the area and Lens cannot keep giving the Gunners these opportunities as even Kanu will score eventually.<br><strong>22</strong> Maybe because they think he can't score, but Kanu has been given the freedom to roam Highbury, the Lens defence finding it very difficult to pick him up, especially when he is in possession. nothing comes of this move, but the visitors need to be careful of the space they are giving to this talented player.<br><strong>25</strong> Petit, Overmars and Kanu combine well on both flanks to keep the pressure on Lens, who have been pushing up more after their early setback. You feel that Arsenal need to build on their superiority and translate that into goals in case this Lens side craft an away goal on the break.<br><strong>29</strong> For the second time tonight, Ray Parlour has turned down a gilt-edged shooting opportunity. He certainly didn't do that in Bremen - tonight he seems to want to play the vital through-ball when a shot is probably the better option.<br><strong>32</strong> Lens on the attack through Blanchard and Coridon, the lone threat up front. So far Keown seems to have the measure of the Frenchman in the air, but the balls through the middle to the Lens forward are increasing in frequency.<br><strong>35</strong> Coridon provides an undignified end to a promising move which started with Petit losing possession in midfield to Moriera, who fed the powerful forward Nouma. The ball fell to Coridon, who spooned the ball into the crowd from 25 yards on the centre-left.<br><strong>38</strong> Kanu is unlucky to be penalised after robbing Coly off the ball when he was the last defender 35 yards from goal. The challenge certainly appeared innocuous enough.<br><strong>41</strong> Lens coming more and more into this game. Nouma draws a foul from Vieira, ten yards in from the right touchline. Brunel, the left-foot specialist, drives the ball firmly over the centre of Seaman's crossbar. Lens are edging closer and closer to that vital away goal.<br><strong>44</strong> Since the goal and the few minutes of shock that followed it, Lens have grown in stature and are now posing a genuine threat to Seaman in the Arsenal goal. The only thing preventing any sustained pressure from the visitors is that their attacking flair is not matched by ball-winning in midfield. Arsenal still have the upper hand in terms of possession.<br><strong>46</strong> A good spell for Lens late in the first half. Coridon again causing mischief on the left of the Arsenal area. Dixon eventually recovers possession and Arsenal can break again.<br><strong>47</strong> The half-time whistle comes with the game interestingly poised between Arsenal's attacking ambition and Lens' hunt for an away-goal. Should be an engrossing second half.<br></p> <p><strong>45</strong> Arsenal restart but lose the ball straight away to Coridon, who tries to find Nouma in the Arsenal area from the right. His cross is overhit, but Arsenal cannot surrender possession to Coridon who looks Lens' sharpest player by far. Goal kick to Arsenal.<br><strong>48</strong> Petit in midfield feeds Parlour, who plays a one-touch lay-off to Bergkamp on the right flank. His low, driven cross finds Kanu, but Coly's challenge is sufficient to distract the Arsenal striker. Goal kick.<br><strong>52</strong> A corner to Arsenal taken by Petit on the right. The inswinger is well claimed by Warmuz at his near post.<br><strong>54</strong> Bergkamp <strong>booked</strong> for a silly challenge on Blanchard in midfield. In response, Wenger asks Ljundberg to begin warming up.<br><strong>55</strong> Silvinho's persistence is repaid when he wins the ball from Queudrue on the left. His outswinging cross is aimed at Kanu, but replacement full-back Coly, facing his goal with Kanu behind him, does everything right and spoons the ball harmlessly into the air and Lens can clear.<br><strong>60</strong> The ref lets Coly and Bergkamp know that he's watching them. While the official's eyes are elsewhere, Moreira slides in on Grimandi and is <strong>booked</strong>.<br><strong>62</strong> Good build-up play on the right from Arsenal, but the final ball from Dixon is a poor one. The quality has left this game for a while, and the game needs a goal or an incident to get its spark back.<br><strong>66</strong> Overmars close to adding to Arsenal's total as he traps Dixon's cross with his back to goal, but Sikora is alert to the threat and the chance is snuffed out. A corner results, and Petit's delivery is deep, but Grimandi handles the ball and Lens regain possession.<br><strong>69</strong> Vieira and Petit, virtually anonymous this half, combine well in midfield and draw the foul. The free kick is quickly taken to Parlour on the right, who plays an excellent cross onto the knee of Marc Overmars. The ball sails over the crossbar and a great chance goes begging.<br><strong>70</strong> A let-off for Arsenal as Brunel in space on the left for Lens, feeds Nouma in the area. His side foot beats Seaman but ricochets off the bar and into the crowd. If the visitors don't score that miss will haunt the Lens striker.<br><strong>74 Arsenal substitution:</strong> Ljundberg for Overmars. The in-form Swede replaces the disappointing Dutchman. What price a Freddie goal?<br><strong>78 Lens substitution:</strong> Sakho for Moreira. That brings the total Senegalese presence to two.<br><strong>81</strong> The game is reaching a climax of sorts - this largely disappointing second half has had incident and chances, but the overall feel of the game has been strangely dispassionate. Arsenal will look to super-sub Suker to inject some life into this wilting affair.<br><strong>82 Arsenal substitution:</strong> Suker for Bergkamp.<br><strong>84</strong> A corner to Lens from the left is overhit and Arsenal dash upfield, only for Vieira to lose control on the right-hand touchline. Dross.<br><strong>84</strong> Some quality at last from the two subs - Ljundberg runs in from the right past three defenders to roll a perfect pass to Suker running in from the left. His first-time shot has goal written all over it but somehow Warmuz gets down to his near post and palms the shot away. Arsenal's best move this half by a country mile.<br><strong>88</strong> After a clumsy challenge, Keown bellows and grunts at the referee until he consents and <strong>books</strong> him.<br><strong>90</strong> A free kick to Lens 30 yards out centre-right. Right-footer Sikora curls a shot around the seven-man wall and into the side netting whilst a stationary Seaman looks on, beaten. This game has a strange feel about it. No-one in the Arsenal defence is even screaming at each other after another near miss.<br><strong>93</strong> Kanu penalised for a foul on Coly and both players are mystified. It is the last surreal decision of a dull half. Full time: Arsenal 1 - 0 Lens.<br></p>",

Dross. 84 Some quality at last from the two subs - Ljundberg runs in from the right past three defenders to roll a perfect pass to Suker running in from the left. His first-time shot has goal written all over it but somehow Warmuz gets down to his near post and palms the shot away. Arsenal's best move this half by a country mile. 88 After a clumsy challenge, Keown bellows and grunts at the referee until he consents and books him. 90 A free kick to Lens 30 yards out centre-right. Right-footer Sikora curls a shot around the seven-man wall and into the side netting whilst a stationary Seaman looks on, beaten. This game has a strange feel about it. No-one in the Arsenal defence is even screaming at each other after another near miss. 93 Kanu penalised for a foul on Coly and both players are mystified. It is the last surreal decision of a dull half. Full time: Arsenal 1 - 0 Lens.",

And their away form has been patchy too. They've been beaten by sides deep in the relegation quagmire, like Real Betis and Seville, and just last month were thrashed 3-0 by Real Madrid - who most people had written off before their game against Manchester United on Tuesday. </p> <p>In short, we need a sense of perspective here. Barcelona are a fine team, and boast an attacking three of Patrick Kluivert, Luis Figo and Rivaldo which is the equal of any side in the world. But they're not the sporting supermen that everyone built them up to be, particularly in defence. Similarly, Chelsea aren't quite the no-hopers that everyone seemed to think either. </p> <p>What last night's game really showed us was that when two teams with world class players meet, the result is never a foregone concusion, whatever the tabloids say. Any team - no matter how good they supposedly are - is fallible. And as Chelsea proved, when they are hit hard enough - and often enough - even the giants of the world game can come crashing down. </p> <p>email: <a href=\"mailto:sean.ingle@theguardian.com\">sean.ingle@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Futhermore, the results of the mighty Barcelona - who were heralded as the best team on the planet when then arrived in London earlier this week - haven't been that convincing in the Primera Liga. They've twice lost a league game in the Nou Camp this season - to mid-table Malaga and the mighty Alaves (who have also incidentially done the double over them). And their away form has been patchy too. They've been beaten by sides deep in the relegation quagmire, like Real Betis and Seville, and just last month were thrashed 3-0 by Real Madrid - who most people had written off before their game against Manchester United on Tuesday. In short, we need a sense of perspective here. Barcelona are a fine team, and boast an attacking three of Patrick Kluivert, Luis Figo and Rivaldo which is the equal of any side in the world. But they're not the sporting supermen that everyone built them up to be, particularly in defence. Similarly, Chelsea aren't quite the no-hopers that everyone seemed to think either. What last night's game really showed us was that when two teams with world class players meet, the result is never a foregone concusion, whatever the tabloids say. Any team - no matter how good they supposedly are - is fallible. And as Chelsea proved, when they are hit hard enough - and often enough - even the giants of the world game can come crashing down. email: sean.ingle@theguardian.com",

The rationale is that the game has to be played at some stage and we accept that on balance it is a fair decision.\" </p> <p>Reports are still sketchy about the violence that left Christopher Loftus and Kevin Speight dead and another Leeds supporter seriously ill in hospital.

Many will also provide the necessary paperwork for a small fee - SCI charges \u00a325 - and most small independent firms are happy to sell coffins, although prices are likely to be higher than those bought direct from a supplier. </p> <p>The first concern for those who want to go their own way is how to store the body. If the deceased died in hospital, the hospital will probably consent to keep them in the on-site mortuary free of charge for a few days. Otherwise, it is a good idea to pay for a place in a funeral parlour mortuary or to get the corpse embalmed. </p> <p>If the person died at home, a doctor must have visited them within two weeks, otherwise the death is referred to a coroner.

The man's job title was something like Manager of Decommissioned Underground Material and I had gone to see him with Michael Morris, one of the directors of Artangel, a company that puts on art events in different media in unusual places. He was trying to get permission to use the tunnels and platforms for The Vertical Line, a performance piece devised by John Berger.</p> <p>In Ways of Seeing, Berger presented on television for the first time an ideological analysis of art and aesthetics. One of the programmes juxtaposed pin-ups and centrefolds with Titians, in a powerful early assault on advertising. Thirty years later, Berger was still in compelling voice, a burly, gravelly oracle prowling in the dromos of the underground tunnels, as he took us down with him on an archaeological excavation of art, past the encaustic portraits on the mummies of Fayum, deeper down to the cave paintings of Chauvet. Art figured as a magical enactment: \"Smell the bear!\" he commanded as he evoked in the darkness a prehistoric drawing. Then, describing the vitality of art made thousands of years ago, he marvelled: \"In the beginning there was no fumbling.\"</p> <p>Julian Stallabrass, in his Verrine blast against Britart, combines the early Berger's fierce critique of consumerist contamination with the later Berger's sense of art's high purpose: \"It is often said of high art lite that it has a dark view of things,\" he writes, \"and it does; the true depth of its cynicism, though, is not be found in its representation of suicides, or torture victims, or abused children, or in its multitude of corpses, but instead in all that it turns its back on, all that it leaves out when it comes to what art can be.\" As it pans the miasmic waters where the Chapman Brothers, Gavin Turk, Tracey Emin and of course Damien Hirst loom, High Art Lite finds the ark of art occupied, betrayed and shipwrecked. The principles that gave the avant-garde of the earlier part of the 20th century its energy and optimism have rebounded on themselves and collapsed: the use of popular material as an anti-\u00e9litist, anti-bourgeois strategy; the flouting of proprieties; the wilfully bad execution and recourse to deskilled methods; the spurning of the West End for Shoreditch and Hoxton - all the 'alternative' themes and media and sites and forms of attention have been emulsified into a phenomenon on which Tony Blair smiles.</p> <p>Stallabrass follows the tracks of this social monster, which can be identified by what seems to be an infinitely elastic, numbing permissiveness, from mannikins of children with penises for noses and vulvae for mouths to used sanitary towels cast from an unmade bed. Stallabrass excoriates the artists' nihilism, cynicism and tourist populism: he describes the ubiquity of urban decay, social ruination and personal degradation in their imagery as 'urban pastoralism', a late millennial equivalent of the rococo's pleasure in swains and Bo-peeps frolicking in hayricks. \"A pervasive and disabling irony becalms the work,\" he writes, \"in a manner that is supposed, in conventional wisdom, to challenge the viewer but which in fact conveniently opens up demotic material to safe aesthetic delectation.\" How indeed should one enjoy, in Aristotle's phrase, \"the figures of the most despicable animals, or of human corpses\"?</p> <p>Catharsis is no longer the aim, but can it still be an effect of Mat Collishaw's magnified bullet wound, or Hirst's cloven-hoofed beasts? Stallabrass emphatically refuses this ancient validation, believing that the way Britart is presented - the Royal Academy the venue, Saatchi the patron - fatally puffs it into empty bubbles (the unbearable liteness of the book's title). Britart is part of \"a wider failure of a culture of opposition\": the artists' deliberate assault on good taste, political correctness, and Enlightenment models of aesthetic value and social progress is just a matter of style, a form of quickfix entertainment which, as Gavin Turk warns, isn't even \"particularly entertaining\". Stallabrass concedes defeat, too: there is no place for the critic to triangulate the deadly shot that will burst this ballooning monster. \"For theory,\" he writes despairingly, \"the combination of a false but ineluctable authenticity from which the art is supposed to issue and the neutral, non-judgmental position that it adopts, is lethal.\" Interestingly, Stallabrass has found points of sensitivity and even resistance in the bodies of his victims: the space where a plate of Steve McQueen's Bear should have appeared remains blank, with the supertitle, 'Permission to reproduce denied'. This happens in Richard Billingham's case as well, although his pictures of his family escape Stallabrass's everlasting fire. </p> <p>Concurrently with last year's Turner Prize show at the Tate, Ana Maria Pacheco, a Brazilian artist long resident in this country, showed the works resulting from her year's residency at the National Gallery. Dark Night of the Soul is a monumental piece, consisting of 19 massive figures carved out of wood and arranged like a Latin American Stations of the Cross around the glaringly spotlit figure of a naked man bound and hooded for execution. The statues are larger than life-size, with eerie, enlarged, polished onyx eyes and small teeth (real ones). You could walk among the statues, become part of the scene, one of the witnesses, one of the voyeurs, and share in the figures' perplexity and awe. Pacheco also showed richly coloured, buffed and waxed oil paintings on mythical themes: the temptation of St Anthony as a modern apocalypse, the tryst of Solomon and Sheba as a battle of wits from a spirited fairy tale. The show was popular, and the crowds were hushed. Brian Sewell praised it, against his first instincts, he admitted. </p> <p>Stallabrass doesn't mention Pacheco, or indeed many other artists who aren't in the Tate inner circle, even by way of contrast to his lite targets, and although Dark Night of the Soul engages directly with contemporary issues, delivers a powerful sense of tragic humanity, and, above all, avoids irony, my sense is that Stallabrass still wouldn't find it in himself to praise it. He's very tough on Mark Wallinger, for example. Discussing Capital, Wallinger's 1990 corporate portrait sequence of homeless people, Stallabrass decides that \"despite his laudable intentions, there is something knowing and cold, almost mocking about these works.\" Permission to reproduce was denied in this case as well. He doesn't mention Wallinger's tiny, frail, pallid figure of Ecce Homo, which was put up on the empty fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square.</p> <p>Can any art made today fulfil what used to be accepted as its chief aims: to illuminate the human predicament, to reveal truths, to illustrate in a heightened manner contemporary existence, to question the status quo, to shed lacrimae rerum? If any art can do this, will it still be able to take its place in the ever-growing octopoid world of venues, private views and PRs? Stallabrass isn't asking that Britart do anything unprecedented. He wants to keep all the right enemies (and not find himself finessed so that he's lined up with Sewell - or the late Peter Fuller) and stay out on the left flank; his fury is rather Victorian - Ruskin's rage against the immoralism of the Baroque. </p> <p>Oddly enough, Matthew Collings - in the book of his Channel Four series - says many of the same things as Stallabrass; he even borrows the term 'art lite'. But most of the time he seems to like the art and the artists, for the same reasons that Stallabrass detests them. He feels easy with numbness and dumbness and \"shock, horror\"; he doesn't vituperate against vacuousness and lack of affect; he likes being made to feel \"glidey\" and \"nice\"; he's funny about the artists' self-mythologising and bad behaviour, and irony for him is natural. The presiding angel would appear to be Gertrude Stein, in Alice B. Toklas mode, faux-naive and paratactic, artless and kooky, the godmother of Adrian Mole. But his favourite art critic, as he admits in It Hurts, his book about the New York art scene, is Clement Greenberg, and he can suddenly throw out a shrewd, decisive insight in the master's best manner. His claims on art's behalf are modest and canny; \"windiness\" is a favourite term of condemnation. The Chapman Brothers's gruesome 3-D reworking of Goya's Disasters of War prompts the comment: \"Everything odd and inexplicable about Goya rushes to the foreground. And everything that was a timeless humane truth about the horror of atrocity seeps away.\"</p> <p>The book bears the marks of its origin as a TV series: potted biographies of the founding heroes (Jackson Pollock and Picasso) interpolated here and there, scenic shoots in studios far and wide, and a haphazard structure. It does well, though, to place the Sensation lot in a family tree, with Goya, Munch, Picasso, America, Modernism and Matisse. Collings has a vigorous curiosity about aesthetic value and in an interesting chapter called 'Lovely, Lovely' tries to get to grips with the question of beauty: \"We know no artists will ever be nominated for the Turner Prize for their contribution to loveliness,\" he writes. \"But the loveliness we find in a lot of art . . . seems to be a property or quality that can never be wholly got rid of. However much we may stop mentioning it and try and shame it into leaving, it just keeps on hanging around.\"</p> <p>Chris Ofili, who won the Turner Prize in 1998, is included in this chapter with his sequinned, beaded, dotted, varnished, lustrous, rainbow-coloured paeans in paint to numinous beings - Captain Shit and the Virgin Mary and various other Ebony or Hello! heroes and heroines. The difference between Stallabrass's approach and Collings's couldn't be plainer: in High Art Lite Ofili gets three colour pics and a thorough discussion of the arguments used to defend/praise him, concluding with a resonant dismissal of his work (\"Indeed, it is utterly of a piece with high art lite in its refusal to do anything other than present a dilemma\"). In This Is Modern Art, Ofili is treated to three colour pics and a four-page discussion marked by the ropey syntax and meandering musings that Stallabrass finds so infuriating about the Britart running dogs: \"Is it identity politics that drives him?\" Collings asks: \"It would be exhausting now to remember what they are and write it all down.\" For Stallabrass, Ofili has failed the cause of Stephen Lawrence because he feeds the \"largely white and certainly largely privileged gallery-going audience with standard prejudices about blacks, delivered in a manner that is so over-the-top as to be absurd\". These ironies were exultantly lost on the schoolkids I saw in the Ofili room at the Turner Prize show at the Tate, who identified for me every one of the tiny black faces in the stars spangling the background of one of the Captain Shit and the All Stars pictures. For Collings, acting the idiot aesthete again, \"the look of Ofili's paintings is always beautiful.\"</p> <p>What can art do now? and What should art do now? are distinct questions, but they both go to the heart of the problem facing the visual arts in the age of global iconomania, in the multimedia blizzard of signs and non-signs. In New York, Mayor Giuliani snatched at an opportunity for crowd-pleasing when he denounced Ofili's The Holy Mother Mary, but the episode showed that scandal can still erupt around the images lambasted by Stallabrass as meaninglessly, lethally equivocal.</p> <p>Collings ends with a promise that art still holds out \"hope, marvels, beauty, a route to transcendent meanings, a few laughs\". Stallabrass, too, if scathingly, proposes laughter as a possible response to contemporary art, and the productions of Emin and Hirst, like horror film gore and monster comics, often elicit a grim, gallows humour - shrinking, wincing, giggling and smirking. It's a new twist in the long tradition of the grotesque and Collings is right to draw attention to the pleasure-in-pain, in which relish and disgust are coiled together, stirred by Goya's fantastic nightmares: \"We feel there ought to be a dividing line somewhere - between art and sadism. Someone should tell us what it is. Did Goya have a dividing line in his head? Were there any boundary lines in there at all?\"</p> <p>The tendency to monstrous imagery wavers; it doesn't keep up a constant pressure - unlike, perhaps, the desire for beauty. It would appear to be at high tide today, however, sucking into its undertow an interest in detritus, effluvia, leavings - industrial, military and carnal - as well as a delight in childishness (polymorphous perversity): these characteristics can be swept up into the larger family of deformations, malformations and formlessness. In his original and fascinating overview of aesthetic change in The World of Sculpture (Pimlico, 435 pp., \u00a315, 6 April, 0 7126 6442 4) James Hall attributes the shift to messy, ramshackle mixed media constructions and the taste for haptic variety to the influence of Maria Montessori and her belief that touch is the primary cognitive sense. The sandpit, mud, lollipop sticks, goo, plasticine, oozing clay and, later, petri dishes and test tubes: playing with such stuff, Hall argues, has clearly influenced the materialisations of contemporary art, so much of it three-dimensional, inherently transient and labile, and playful. Homo ludens has supplanted homo faber.</p> <p>Giving basic epistemological processes visibility and status corresponds to the old, paradoxical role of jesting - both these critics represent their subjects as jesters or fools - which was to speak the unspeakable, but with an accompanying impulse towards self-protection. These images may be apotropaic, like grinning death's heads at the entrances to cities, Medusa heads on temple porticos, snarling griffons on tombs, shelah-na-gigs on castle walls - they are ferocious, grisly, barbarously comic effigies erected to ward off worse terrors. The quips of Shakespeare's fools aren't very funny: they're often rude and nasty, at once riddling and in your face - rough charms uttered to banish care, to lift dullness, whistling in the dark. The fooling function of art doesn't help us to evaluate its aesthetic quality, but Stallabrass's jeremiad reveals that art's politics have to do not with the work, but with the way it is received. (He might like some of these artists more if Saatchi liked them less.) Meanwhile, Collings, with almost spacey, dopey voluptuousness, takes pleasure in not offering a verdict grounded in an aesthetic system of values.</p> <p>\u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">LRB</a>.

      "bodyText": "High Art Lite: British Art in the 1990s by Julian Stallabrass Verso, 342 pp., \u00a322, 8 December 1999, 1 85984 721 8 This Is Modern Art by Matthew Collings Weidenfeld, 270 pp., \u00a320, 24 June 1999, 0 297 84292 7 Buy it at BOL The heavy in shirtsleeves on the door of the disused Strand tube station was working the phone to a reluctant client who had rented the premises for a rave that didn't happen and now didn't want to pay. The man's job title was something like Manager of Decommissioned Underground Material and I had gone to see him with Michael Morris, one of the directors of Artangel, a company that puts on art events in different media in unusual places. He was trying to get permission to use the tunnels and platforms for The Vertical Line, a performance piece devised by John Berger. In Ways of Seeing, Berger presented on television for the first time an ideological analysis of art and aesthetics. One of the programmes juxtaposed pin-ups and centrefolds with Titians, in a powerful early assault on advertising. Thirty years later, Berger was still in compelling voice, a burly, gravelly oracle prowling in the dromos of the underground tunnels, as he took us down with him on an archaeological excavation of art, past the encaustic portraits on the mummies of Fayum, deeper down to the cave paintings of Chauvet. Art figured as a magical enactment: \"Smell the bear!\" he commanded as he evoked in the darkness a prehistoric drawing. Then, describing the vitality of art made thousands of years ago, he marvelled: \"In the beginning there was no fumbling.\" Julian Stallabrass, in his Verrine blast against Britart, combines the early Berger's fierce critique of consumerist contamination with the later Berger's sense of art's high purpose: \"It is often said of high art lite that it has a dark view of things,\" he writes, \"and it does; the true depth of its cynicism, though, is not be found in its representation of suicides, or torture victims, or abused children, or in its multitude of corpses, but instead in all that it turns its back on, all that it leaves out when it comes to what art can be.\" As it pans the miasmic waters where the Chapman Brothers, Gavin Turk, Tracey Emin and of course Damien Hirst loom, High Art Lite finds the ark of art occupied, betrayed and shipwrecked. The principles that gave the avant-garde of the earlier part of the 20th century its energy and optimism have rebounded on themselves and collapsed: the use of popular material as an anti-\u00e9litist, anti-bourgeois strategy; the flouting of proprieties; the wilfully bad execution and recourse to deskilled methods; the spurning of the West End for Shoreditch and Hoxton - all the 'alternative' themes and media and sites and forms of attention have been emulsified into a phenomenon on which Tony Blair smiles. Stallabrass follows the tracks of this social monster, which can be identified by what seems to be an infinitely elastic, numbing permissiveness, from mannikins of children with penises for noses and vulvae for mouths to used sanitary towels cast from an unmade bed. Stallabrass excoriates the artists' nihilism, cynicism and tourist populism: he describes the ubiquity of urban decay, social ruination and personal degradation in their imagery as 'urban pastoralism', a late millennial equivalent of the rococo's pleasure in swains and Bo-peeps frolicking in hayricks. \"A pervasive and disabling irony becalms the work,\" he writes, \"in a manner that is supposed, in conventional wisdom, to challenge the viewer but which in fact conveniently opens up demotic material to safe aesthetic delectation.\" How indeed should one enjoy, in Aristotle's phrase, \"the figures of the most despicable animals, or of human corpses\"? Catharsis is no longer the aim, but can it still be an effect of Mat Collishaw's magnified bullet wound, or Hirst's cloven-hoofed beasts? Stallabrass emphatically refuses this ancient validation, believing that the way Britart is presented - the Royal Academy the venue, Saatchi the patron - fatally puffs it into empty bubbles (the unbearable liteness of the book's title). Britart is part of \"a wider failure of a culture of opposition\": the artists' deliberate assault on good taste, political correctness, and Enlightenment models of aesthetic value and social progress is just a matter of style, a form of quickfix entertainment which, as Gavin Turk warns, isn't even \"particularly entertaining\". Stallabrass concedes defeat, too: there is no place for the critic to triangulate the deadly shot that will burst this ballooning monster. \"For theory,\" he writes despairingly, \"the combination of a false but ineluctable authenticity from which the art is supposed to issue and the neutral, non-judgmental position that it adopts, is lethal.\" Interestingly, Stallabrass has found points of sensitivity and even resistance in the bodies of his victims: the space where a plate of Steve McQueen's Bear should have appeared remains blank, with the supertitle, 'Permission to reproduce denied'. This happens in Richard Billingham's case as well, although his pictures of his family escape Stallabrass's everlasting fire. Concurrently with last year's Turner Prize show at the Tate, Ana Maria Pacheco, a Brazilian artist long resident in this country, showed the works resulting from her year's residency at the National Gallery. Dark Night of the Soul is a monumental piece, consisting of 19 massive figures carved out of wood and arranged like a Latin American Stations of the Cross around the glaringly spotlit figure of a naked man bound and hooded for execution. The statues are larger than life-size, with eerie, enlarged, polished onyx eyes and small teeth (real ones). You could walk among the statues, become part of the scene, one of the witnesses, one of the voyeurs, and share in the figures' perplexity and awe. Pacheco also showed richly coloured, buffed and waxed oil paintings on mythical themes: the temptation of St Anthony as a modern apocalypse, the tryst of Solomon and Sheba as a battle of wits from a spirited fairy tale. The show was popular, and the crowds were hushed. Brian Sewell praised it, against his first instincts, he admitted. Stallabrass doesn't mention Pacheco, or indeed many other artists who aren't in the Tate inner circle, even by way of contrast to his lite targets, and although Dark Night of the Soul engages directly with contemporary issues, delivers a powerful sense of tragic humanity, and, above all, avoids irony, my sense is that Stallabrass still wouldn't find it in himself to praise it. He's very tough on Mark Wallinger, for example. Discussing Capital, Wallinger's 1990 corporate portrait sequence of homeless people, Stallabrass decides that \"despite his laudable intentions, there is something knowing and cold, almost mocking about these works.\" Permission to reproduce was denied in this case as well. He doesn't mention Wallinger's tiny, frail, pallid figure of Ecce Homo, which was put up on the empty fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square. Can any art made today fulfil what used to be accepted as its chief aims: to illuminate the human predicament, to reveal truths, to illustrate in a heightened manner contemporary existence, to question the status quo, to shed lacrimae rerum? If any art can do this, will it still be able to take its place in the ever-growing octopoid world of venues, private views and PRs? Stallabrass isn't asking that Britart do anything unprecedented. He wants to keep all the right enemies (and not find himself finessed so that he's lined up with Sewell - or the late Peter Fuller) and stay out on the left flank; his fury is rather Victorian - Ruskin's rage against the immoralism of the Baroque. Oddly enough, Matthew Collings - in the book of his Channel Four series - says many of the same things as Stallabrass; he even borrows the term 'art lite'. But most of the time he seems to like the art and the artists, for the same reasons that Stallabrass detests them. He feels easy with numbness and dumbness and \"shock, horror\"; he doesn't vituperate against vacuousness and lack of affect; he likes being made to feel \"glidey\" and \"nice\"; he's funny about the artists' self-mythologising and bad behaviour, and irony for him is natural. The presiding angel would appear to be Gertrude Stein, in Alice B. Toklas mode, faux-naive and paratactic, artless and kooky, the godmother of Adrian Mole. But his favourite art critic, as he admits in It Hurts, his book about the New York art scene, is Clement Greenberg, and he can suddenly throw out a shrewd, decisive insight in the master's best manner. His claims on art's behalf are modest and canny; \"windiness\" is a favourite term of condemnation.

There is still the hope of glory and, just as important, of showing the discipline and decency which Sir Alex Ferguson commands from his team's fans. Tonight's game against Galatasary and next week's second leg at Elland Road could be the best memorial for Ken Speight and his fellow-victim Chris Loftus. There's a powerful feeling in Leeds of everyone willing that to be so.",

Can you tell me what the match was, and who scored 43 runs and took 11 wickets in it? And any ideas on who might have been sitting in Box 10 with the initials EWF? </strong> asks Markus Steger </p> <p>The box refers to the Eton v Harrow schools' match of 1919. The player was Wilfred William (later Sir Wilfred) Hill-Wood, who scored 43 (and 0) and took 4-40 and 7-29 with his legbreaks as Eton won by 202 runs. The match had a controversial start when GO \"Gubby\" Allen, who later captained England, was run out while backing up in the first over, before he had even faced a ball. The identity of the man in Box 10 is a bit more difficult - books don't often list the spectators as well as the players! - but my money would be on EW Foljambe, who played in the match for Eton in 1908 and 1909. The match was (and still is) a great meeting place for old Etonians and Harrovians, so a lot of former players would have been at Lord's for the game.</p> <p><strong>Where was Mohinder \"Jimmy\" Amarnath given out \"obstructing the field\" in a one-day international? </strong> asks R Shantaram</p> <p>It happened in India's match against Sri Lanka at Ahmedabad, during the Nehru Cup competition in 1989-90. The batsman kicked the ball away from the bowler to avoid being run out. Amarnath also managed another odd dismissal: in the second final of the World Series Cup against Australia at Melbourne in 1985-86 he was given out \"handled the ball\". Daryll Cullinan of South Africa is the only other batsman to be out this way in one-day internationals.</p> <p> <strong>Can you give the list of overseas players who will be playing county cricket this year?</strong> asks Jishnu Biswas</p> <p>Australians dominate this list: 12 of the 18 counties have plumped for an Aussie this season. They are Michael Di Venuto (Derbyshire), Simon Katich (Durham), Stuart Law (Essex), Matthew Elliott (Glamorgan), Ian Harvey (Gloucestershire), Shane Warne (Hampshire), Justin Langer (Middlesex), Matthew Hayden (Northamptonshire), Jamie Cox (Somerset), Michael Bevan (Sussex), Glenn McGrath (Worcestershire) and Darren Lehmann (Yorkshire). There are three Indians, Rahul Dravid (Kent), Sourav Ganguly (Lancashire) and Anil Kumble (Leicestershire), two Pakistanis, Shoaib Akhtar (Nottinghamshire) and Saqlain Mushtaq (Surrey), and one South African - Allan Donald (Warwickshire). For the first time in many years there won't be any West Indians.</p> <p> <strong>Which West Indian Test cricketer was the first black governor of the BBC?</strong> asks Russell Armstrong</p> <p>It was Lord Constantine who, as Learie Constantine, played 18 Tests for West Indies between 1928 and 1939. After retiring from cricket he became a barrister, and was appointed Trinidad's High Commissioner to London in 1962. He was knighted in 1962, and made a life peer in 1969. He died in 1971.</p> <p><strong>Was there an English Test cricketer called Basil D'Oliveira?</strong> asks Donald Barry Voegt</p> <p>Indeed there was. Basil Lewis D'Oliveira was born in Cape Town in 1931. He captained South Africa's non-white team in the 1950s but, because he was coloured, he was affected by the odious apartheid policy and was not allowed to play official Test cricket at home. He moved to England to try his luck, and qualified to play for Worcestershire in 1965: in a turn of events that reads more like a fairytale he proved so successful that the following year he played for England, even though he was 35 by then. \"Dolly\" finished with 2484 runs and 47 wickets in 44 Tests. He made a famous century against Australia at The Oval in 1968. That winter, after initially being omitted from the squad, D'Oliveira was called up to play for England in South Africa, but their government refused to accept him as a tourist and the tour was cancelled. England didn't play South Africa again until 1994. D'Oliveira played on until 1980 for Worcestershire, where he was (and remains) a crowd favourite. And he was my first cricketing hero too, dating roughly from the time at The Oval in 1968 when he ran into the crowd and accidentally spiked one of my tomato sandwiches. He said \"Sorry, son,\" and became the first Test cricketer who ever spoke to me. </p> <p> <strong>For which county did Ted Dexter play? </strong> asks Keith Henbrey</p> <p>\"Lord Ted\" played for Sussex, from 1957 to 1968. He was the first captain to lift the Gillette Cup, in 1963. He also played 62 Tests for England, 30 of them as captain, and later served as chairman of selectors (1989-93), as well as being the brains behind the PricewaterhouseCoopers Ratings. Dexter was born in Milan, in Italy, and one story has it that Sussex successfully argued that he was qualified to play for them because they are the nearest first-class county to Italy as the crow flies.</p> <p><em>Steven Lynch is managing editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly</em></p> <p>We regret that not all questions can be answered and that personal correspondence can only sometimes be entered into</p>",

Can you tell me what the match was, and who scored 43 runs and took 11 wickets in it? And any ideas on who might have been sitting in Box 10 with the initials EWF? asks Markus Steger The box refers to the Eton v Harrow schools' match of 1919. The player was Wilfred William (later Sir Wilfred) Hill-Wood, who scored 43 (and 0) and took 4-40 and 7-29 with his legbreaks as Eton won by 202 runs. The match had a controversial start when GO \"Gubby\" Allen, who later captained England, was run out while backing up in the first over, before he had even faced a ball. The identity of the man in Box 10 is a bit more difficult - books don't often list the spectators as well as the players! - but my money would be on EW Foljambe, who played in the match for Eton in 1908 and 1909. The match was (and still is) a great meeting place for old Etonians and Harrovians, so a lot of former players would have been at Lord's for the game. Where was Mohinder \"Jimmy\" Amarnath given out \"obstructing the field\" in a one-day international? asks R Shantaram It happened in India's match against Sri Lanka at Ahmedabad, during the Nehru Cup competition in 1989-90. The batsman kicked the ball away from the bowler to avoid being run out. Amarnath also managed another odd dismissal: in the second final of the World Series Cup against Australia at Melbourne in 1985-86 he was given out \"handled the ball\". Daryll Cullinan of South Africa is the only other batsman to be out this way in one-day internationals. Can you give the list of overseas players who will be playing county cricket this year? asks Jishnu Biswas Australians dominate this list: 12 of the 18 counties have plumped for an Aussie this season. They are Michael Di Venuto (Derbyshire), Simon Katich (Durham), Stuart Law (Essex), Matthew Elliott (Glamorgan), Ian Harvey (Gloucestershire), Shane Warne (Hampshire), Justin Langer (Middlesex), Matthew Hayden (Northamptonshire), Jamie Cox (Somerset), Michael Bevan (Sussex), Glenn McGrath (Worcestershire) and Darren Lehmann (Yorkshire). There are three Indians, Rahul Dravid (Kent), Sourav Ganguly (Lancashire) and Anil Kumble (Leicestershire), two Pakistanis, Shoaib Akhtar (Nottinghamshire) and Saqlain Mushtaq (Surrey), and one South African - Allan Donald (Warwickshire). For the first time in many years there won't be any West Indians. Which West Indian Test cricketer was the first black governor of the BBC? asks Russell Armstrong It was Lord Constantine who, as Learie Constantine, played 18 Tests for West Indies between 1928 and 1939. After retiring from cricket he became a barrister, and was appointed Trinidad's High Commissioner to London in 1962. He was knighted in 1962, and made a life peer in 1969. He died in 1971. Was there an English Test cricketer called Basil D'Oliveira? asks Donald Barry Voegt Indeed there was. Basil Lewis D'Oliveira was born in Cape Town in 1931. He captained South Africa's non-white team in the 1950s but, because he was coloured, he was affected by the odious apartheid policy and was not allowed to play official Test cricket at home. He moved to England to try his luck, and qualified to play for Worcestershire in 1965: in a turn of events that reads more like a fairytale he proved so successful that the following year he played for England, even though he was 35 by then. \"Dolly\" finished with 2484 runs and 47 wickets in 44 Tests. He made a famous century against Australia at The Oval in 1968. That winter, after initially being omitted from the squad, D'Oliveira was called up to play for England in South Africa, but their government refused to accept him as a tourist and the tour was cancelled. England didn't play South Africa again until 1994. D'Oliveira played on until 1980 for Worcestershire, where he was (and remains) a crowd favourite. And he was my first cricketing hero too, dating roughly from the time at The Oval in 1968 when he ran into the crowd and accidentally spiked one of my tomato sandwiches. He said \"Sorry, son,\" and became the first Test cricketer who ever spoke to me. For which county did Ted Dexter play? asks Keith Henbrey \"Lord Ted\" played for Sussex, from 1957 to 1968. He was the first captain to lift the Gillette Cup, in 1963. He also played 62 Tests for England, 30 of them as captain, and later served as chairman of selectors (1989-93), as well as being the brains behind the PricewaterhouseCoopers Ratings. Dexter was born in Milan, in Italy, and one story has it that Sussex successfully argued that he was qualified to play for them because they are the nearest first-class county to Italy as the crow flies.

      "body": "<p>Thirty six Labour MPs last night joined forces with Conservatives and Liberal Democrats in an attempt to force ministers to allow disclosure of the factual basis behind their policy decisions under the government's freedom of information bill.</p> <p>Voting was 202 to 311, a government majority of 109, leaving Labour rebels to claim 36 supporters. Earlier predictions that up to 60 Labour members would revolt were eroded by Jack Straw's concessions on Tuesday night.</p> <p>As the Commons entered a marathon late night session to give detailed report-stage examination to Mr Straw's controversial measure, the home secretary insisted that the government had acted in good faith over the bill - and wider disclosure of information - since 1997.</p> <p>At stake in the first of last night's tests of strength between loyalists and the cross-party coalition was the rebel ambition to ensure that the factual data behind government decisions is published even if the sensitive policy advice from officials is withheld.</p> <p>Mr Straw's bill, watered down from the white paper drafted by David Clark - the sacked cabinet office minister - exempts 23 categories of information, ranging from security matters to commercially sensitive ones, from FoI requests.</p> <p>Last night, Tony Wright, chairman of the Commons public administration committee, who led the revolt, hinted that Downing Street \"forces in the land even mightier than the home secretary\" were behind the tougher line. Tony Blair is known to share fears, based on US experience of FoI, that officials will not offer candid advice if they know it could shortly be published.

      "bodyText": "Thirty six Labour MPs last night joined forces with Conservatives and Liberal Democrats in an attempt to force ministers to allow disclosure of the factual basis behind their policy decisions under the government's freedom of information bill. Voting was 202 to 311, a government majority of 109, leaving Labour rebels to claim 36 supporters. Earlier predictions that up to 60 Labour members would revolt were eroded by Jack Straw's concessions on Tuesday night. As the Commons entered a marathon late night session to give detailed report-stage examination to Mr Straw's controversial measure, the home secretary insisted that the government had acted in good faith over the bill - and wider disclosure of information - since 1997. At stake in the first of last night's tests of strength between loyalists and the cross-party coalition was the rebel ambition to ensure that the factual data behind government decisions is published even if the sensitive policy advice from officials is withheld. Mr Straw's bill, watered down from the white paper drafted by David Clark - the sacked cabinet office minister - exempts 23 categories of information, ranging from security matters to commercially sensitive ones, from FoI requests. Last night, Tony Wright, chairman of the Commons public administration committee, who led the revolt, hinted that Downing Street \"forces in the land even mightier than the home secretary\" were behind the tougher line. Tony Blair is known to share fears, based on US experience of FoI, that officials will not offer candid advice if they know it could shortly be published. Instead they would rely on Post-It stickers which could be attached to policy papers and later removed. But critics in last night's debate derided Mr Straw's claim that there was \"genuine difficulty\" in disentangling \"facts\" from advice. Before pressing his amendments to a vote that would have protected \"facts\" from ministerial restriction, Dr Wright argued that the bill contradicted the whole thrust of the government's commitment to openness in other areas. These included the publication of the minutes of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee on interest rate decisions - \"the sky did not fall in,\" he said. Ahead of the 1997 election Whitehall mandarins had been prepared to separate their \"subjective advice\" from factual data, if Labour had asked them to, he said. Openness benefited ministers as well as the public in an \"era of scepticism\", he said. The Tory MP John Greenway asked why Labour was tightening John Major's code of conduct for disclosure. The former Labour cabinet minister Tony Benn warned Mr Straw that if he knew what the security services were up to he would be the first home secretary ever. \"So I am making the case - I hope it doesn't shock anybody - that open government and freedom of information is good for ministers, not just for parliament and the public.\" Mr Benn added: \"I hope public opinion makes it clear to the home secretary and others that we are not prepared to accept that we shall be treated as children outside the inner knowledge of what happens, because if so it denies ministers the advice they need and the public the opportunity to participate in their future and not just be spectators of their fate.\" The 36 Labour MPs voting against the government on the principle of policy advice being exempt from the bill were: Tony Benn, Dr David Clark, Ann Clwyd, Harry Cohen, Frank Cook, Jeremy Corbyn, Robin Corbett, Jim Cousins, Tam Dalyell, Gwyneth Dunwoody, Mark Fisher, Derek Foster, Neil Gerrard, Thomas Graham, David Hinchliffe, Kelvin Hopkins, Jon Owen Jones, Dr Lynne Jones, Andy Love, John McDonnell, Andrew Mackinlay, Alice Mahon, Jim Marshall, Robert Marshall-Andrews, Bill Michie, Julie Morgan, Gordon Prentice, Alan Simpson, Dennis Skinner, Llewellyn Smith, Betty Williams, David Winnick, Mike Wood, Dr Tony Wright, Derek Wyatt.

Stamina was always his strength, and his willingness to run at defenders, take the ball square and make himself available for return passes enabled Real to maintain some attacking force until the end. </p> <p> Yet it would have been hard on Bosnich had McManaman beaten him at the last. After nine minutes the Australian had denied him a goal for the first time by tipping a diving header over the bar but his best moment was the one-handed save which thwarted Morientes after McManaman and Savio had left the striker with only Bosnich to beat. </p> <p> Ferguson's point about United's sluggish use of the ball was well made. Although Beckham often switched to the middle in the first half, with Ryan Giggs doing the same in the second, and Paul Scholes strove to get forward to support Dwight Yorke and Cole, United's attack seldom achieved its normal rhythm. </p> <p> Yet briefly, on the stroke of half-time, they thought they had gone in front.

Although Beckham often switched to the middle in the first half, with Ryan Giggs doing the same in the second, and Paul Scholes strove to get forward to support Dwight Yorke and Cole, United's attack seldom achieved its normal rhythm. Yet briefly, on the stroke of half-time, they thought they had gone in front. Iker Casillas, Real's 18-year-old goalkeeper, failed to hold Scholes' low shot from 25 yards and, though Yorke pounced to put in the rebound, he was adjudged to have been offside earlier. That moment apart, the game was always going to end as it did if Real failed to score. Real Madrid (4,4,2): Casillas Salgado, Ivan Campo, Karanka, Roberto Carlos McManaman, Helguera, Redondo, Savio (Balic, 75min) Morientes (Ognjenovic, 86), Raul. Manchester United (4,4-2): Bosnich G Neville, Berg, Stam, Irwin (Silvestre, 87) Beckham, Keane, Scholes (Butt, 81), Giggs Cole,Yorke (Sheringham, 76). Referee: G Veissiere (France).",

      "body": "<p>Pirc, the corporate governance watchdog, has thrown its weight behind a controversial attempt by Greenpeace to make BP Amoco withdraw from Alaska. </p> <p>In a report sent out to fund managers yesterday, Pirc urged its clients to vote for a Greenpeace resolution demanding that the oil group redirects investment towards renewable energy sources. </p> <p>The move could trigger an embarassing show of dissent at BP's annual general meeting later this month - Pirc believes its clients own between 3% and 5% of the company. Pirc director Alan MacDougall said: \"We don't think BP has a strategy to deal with the transition away from carbon.\" </p> <p>Greenpeace's resolution calls on BP Amoco to cancel all plans for oil exploration around the Arctic region. This would mean abandoning the company's half-complete $700m (\u00a3450m) Northstar project, which involves the construction of an artificial island off the Alaskan coast. </p> <p>The resolution argues that the money should go towards enlarging BP Solarex - a scheme aimed at producing solar energy. </p> <p>In a highly critical report, Pirc says BP is taking too little action to address the long-term shift away from fossil fuels, which cause global warming: \"We regard the company's approach at present as too passive and would consider it more appropriate for it to show stronger leadership.\" </p> <p>BP, which has gained praise for its statements on the environment in recent years, argues that there is insufficient demand to justify more investment in solar energy. However, Pirc says: \"A company with the resources and scale of BP Amoco can play an important role in creating the conditions for increased demand.\" </p> <p>It says demand could be generated \"through lobbying, marketing and promotional activity as well as through investing in research and development and production\". </p> <p>Pirc admitted there would be a \"short-term cost\" associated with this strategy but said there would be \"compensatory gains\" for shareholders in positioning BP Amoco to take advantage of the future market for renewable energy. </p> <p>Pirc's clients include many of the City's biggest pension funds, managing investments of more than \u00a3250bn. The organisation provides analysis of companies' approaches to executive pay, boardroom appointments and environmental policy. </p> <p>Mr MacDougall admitted there was no chance of Greenpeace's resolution being carried but said support of at least 5% would \"send a strong message and provide a basis for ongoing dialogue with the company\". </p> <p>BP Amoco rejected Pirc's analysis - a spokesman said the company was \"moving as fast as is practical and sensible\" towards renewable energy. </p> <p>The company has commited itself to increasing the size of its solar business ten-fold by 2007, making it a $1,000bn enterprise. The spokesman added: \"it is Pirc's prerogative to advise their clients on how they think their shares should be used.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Pirc, the corporate governance watchdog, has thrown its weight behind a controversial attempt by Greenpeace to make BP Amoco withdraw from Alaska. In a report sent out to fund managers yesterday, Pirc urged its clients to vote for a Greenpeace resolution demanding that the oil group redirects investment towards renewable energy sources. The move could trigger an embarassing show of dissent at BP's annual general meeting later this month - Pirc believes its clients own between 3% and 5% of the company. Pirc director Alan MacDougall said: \"We don't think BP has a strategy to deal with the transition away from carbon.\" Greenpeace's resolution calls on BP Amoco to cancel all plans for oil exploration around the Arctic region. This would mean abandoning the company's half-complete $700m (\u00a3450m) Northstar project, which involves the construction of an artificial island off the Alaskan coast. The resolution argues that the money should go towards enlarging BP Solarex - a scheme aimed at producing solar energy. In a highly critical report, Pirc says BP is taking too little action to address the long-term shift away from fossil fuels, which cause global warming: \"We regard the company's approach at present as too passive and would consider it more appropriate for it to show stronger leadership.\" BP, which has gained praise for its statements on the environment in recent years, argues that there is insufficient demand to justify more investment in solar energy. However, Pirc says: \"A company with the resources and scale of BP Amoco can play an important role in creating the conditions for increased demand.\" It says demand could be generated \"through lobbying, marketing and promotional activity as well as through investing in research and development and production\". Pirc admitted there would be a \"short-term cost\" associated with this strategy but said there would be \"compensatory gains\" for shareholders in positioning BP Amoco to take advantage of the future market for renewable energy. Pirc's clients include many of the City's biggest pension funds, managing investments of more than \u00a3250bn. The organisation provides analysis of companies' approaches to executive pay, boardroom appointments and environmental policy. Mr MacDougall admitted there was no chance of Greenpeace's resolution being carried but said support of at least 5% would \"send a strong message and provide a basis for ongoing dialogue with the company\". BP Amoco rejected Pirc's analysis - a spokesman said the company was \"moving as fast as is practical and sensible\" towards renewable energy. The company has commited itself to increasing the size of its solar business ten-fold by 2007, making it a $1,000bn enterprise. The spokesman added: \"it is Pirc's prerogative to advise their clients on how they think their shares should be used.\"",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>\u0095 <strong>Nic Cage and Patricia Arquette</strong> clearly can't quite decide about each other. Six weeks ago, the couple looked set to call the whole thing off. Today they're apparently back together again. Cage's publicist last night admitted that the actor had withdrawn the divorce papers he served in February but would not explain exactly why, or at what form the couple's relationship now takes. The pair married in May 1995 and appeared together on screen in last year's Martin Scorsese movie Bringing Out the Dead. But on filing for divorce (citing \"irreconcilable differences\"), Cage argued that they had actually been effectively separated since January 1996. They're different from us, these Hollywood folk. </p> <p>\u0095 Heather Graham is in final talks to co-star alongside Johnny Depp in From Hell, the Hughes Brothers' London-set re-telling of the Jack the Ripper story. The <strong>Austin Powers temptress</strong> will play an imperilled Irish prostitute. Depp is already on board as a Scotland Yard cop and the Ripper will be played by Nigel Hawthorne. The film is slated to start shooting at locations around London in July.</p> <p>\u0095 Hot from the success of American Pie, actor <strong>Jason Biggs</strong> has signed up to play Christina Ricci's boyfriend in the upcoming adaptation of Prozac Nation. Based on Elizabeth Wurtzel's best-selling memoir, the film follows the rollercoaster ride lifestyle of a pill-popping over-achiever from Harvard to a career in Manhattan's media circles. The picture marks Ricci's first stab at film producing and will be directed by Norwegian film-maker Erik Skjoldbjaerg, previously best known for his snowbound 1997 thriller Insomnia. </p> <p>\u0095 The Wachowski Brothers are rumoured to be wooing Chinese <strong>martial arts expert Jet Li</strong> to join the cast of their two sequels to The Matrix. Li, who is currently starring in the hit American movie Romeo Must Die, would join original cast-member Keanu Reeves in two films scheduled to begin production later this year. A breakthrough hit on its release last summer, The Matrix scooped an impressive four technical awards at last week's Oscars.</p>",

Today they're apparently back together again. Cage's publicist last night admitted that the actor had withdrawn the divorce papers he served in February but would not explain exactly why, or at what form the couple's relationship now takes. The pair married in May 1995 and appeared together on screen in last year's Martin Scorsese movie Bringing Out the Dead. But on filing for divorce (citing \"irreconcilable differences\"), Cage argued that they had actually been effectively separated since January 1996. They're different from us, these Hollywood folk. \u0095 Heather Graham is in final talks to co-star alongside Johnny Depp in From Hell, the Hughes Brothers' London-set re-telling of the Jack the Ripper story. The Austin Powers temptress will play an imperilled Irish prostitute. Depp is already on board as a Scotland Yard cop and the Ripper will be played by Nigel Hawthorne. The film is slated to start shooting at locations around London in July. \u0095 Hot from the success of American Pie, actor Jason Biggs has signed up to play Christina Ricci's boyfriend in the upcoming adaptation of Prozac Nation. Based on Elizabeth Wurtzel's best-selling memoir, the film follows the rollercoaster ride lifestyle of a pill-popping over-achiever from Harvard to a career in Manhattan's media circles. The picture marks Ricci's first stab at film producing and will be directed by Norwegian film-maker Erik Skjoldbjaerg, previously best known for his snowbound 1997 thriller Insomnia. \u0095 The Wachowski Brothers are rumoured to be wooing Chinese martial arts expert Jet Li to join the cast of their two sequels to The Matrix. Li, who is currently starring in the hit American movie Romeo Must Die, would join original cast-member Keanu Reeves in two films scheduled to begin production later this year. A breakthrough hit on its release last summer, The Matrix scooped an impressive four technical awards at last week's Oscars.",

      "trailText": "<p>Christian Bale began his acting career as a lost little boy in Empire of the Sun. Now he's a murderer in American Psycho. He tells  Libby Brooks about his battle to get the part - and why it cost him his teeth</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The devil is in the dentistry. Christian Bale smiles a newly even smile. Those suggestively vampiric incisors and the feminising gap between his top front teeth are gone. And it's all the fault of an American psycho. </p> <p>\"I liked my old teeth. I have a moulding of them on a shelf. But with Patrick Bateman, his physicality is much more important than with most characters. He deals totally in the superficial, and he's incredibly narcissistic. I looked at myself in the mirror and it just wasn't right. I was warned that if I got caps I could get a lisp, and you might still be able to tell in close-up. So I thought, I like my teeth, but I'm not so attached to them that I'm going to ruin this whole movie because I refuse to get them done.\" </p> <p>He moves his arm and a still, buff bicep strains the knit of his tidy jumper. Preparation for the role of serial-killing 80s alpha-male Patrick Bateman in the screen adaptation of the Bret Easton Ellis novel required dumb-bells as well as braces. Just as Bateman's bloodlust is the amoral mirror of his lust for things, so his bankrupt soul is the necessary continuum of his empty obsession with bodily perfection. </p> <p>\"Working out took over my life,\" says 26-year-old Bale in his nowhere English accent. \"I became fascinated with talking about the body, and diet, and the gym. It made me very judgmental of other people's bodies as well.\" But it is that obsession with surface minutiae that defines the era and its most extreme literary personification, American Psycho. </p> <p>It was a role to perform, rather than understand, Bale insists, echoing his director Mary Harron, who says she believes that a degree of detachment was the only way to prevent a disturbing film becoming an offensive one. \"He's acting in his own life. On paper, of course, he should be hateful, but he's incredibly entertaining.\" </p> <p>Bale's Bateman is a supremely confident confection, and entirely at odds with the engaging naturalism of his recent performances in suburban morality tale Metroland, and Todd Haynes's Velvet Goldmine, in which he starred alongside Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Ewan McGregor. Whether expounding the life lessons to be found in Whitney Houston's The Greatest Love of All, or spinning into frantic despair at the sight of his fag friend's better-looking business card, Bale offers a slicky modulated performance that distills the essence of Bateman, and the book. </p> <p>Published in 1991, American Psycho was Easton Ellis's savage and bloody satire of late 80s extremity. The material fetishism and moral vacuity of the money-drenched, Manhattan-dwelling protagonists were gruesome enough.

      "bodyText": "The devil is in the dentistry. Christian Bale smiles a newly even smile. Those suggestively vampiric incisors and the feminising gap between his top front teeth are gone. And it's all the fault of an American psycho. \"I liked my old teeth. I have a moulding of them on a shelf. But with Patrick Bateman, his physicality is much more important than with most characters. He deals totally in the superficial, and he's incredibly narcissistic. I looked at myself in the mirror and it just wasn't right. I was warned that if I got caps I could get a lisp, and you might still be able to tell in close-up. So I thought, I like my teeth, but I'm not so attached to them that I'm going to ruin this whole movie because I refuse to get them done.\" He moves his arm and a still, buff bicep strains the knit of his tidy jumper. Preparation for the role of serial-killing 80s alpha-male Patrick Bateman in the screen adaptation of the Bret Easton Ellis novel required dumb-bells as well as braces. Just as Bateman's bloodlust is the amoral mirror of his lust for things, so his bankrupt soul is the necessary continuum of his empty obsession with bodily perfection. \"Working out took over my life,\" says 26-year-old Bale in his nowhere English accent. \"I became fascinated with talking about the body, and diet, and the gym. It made me very judgmental of other people's bodies as well.\" But it is that obsession with surface minutiae that defines the era and its most extreme literary personification, American Psycho. It was a role to perform, rather than understand, Bale insists, echoing his director Mary Harron, who says she believes that a degree of detachment was the only way to prevent a disturbing film becoming an offensive one. \"He's acting in his own life. On paper, of course, he should be hateful, but he's incredibly entertaining.\" Bale's Bateman is a supremely confident confection, and entirely at odds with the engaging naturalism of his recent performances in suburban morality tale Metroland, and Todd Haynes's Velvet Goldmine, in which he starred alongside Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Ewan McGregor. Whether expounding the life lessons to be found in Whitney Houston's The Greatest Love of All, or spinning into frantic despair at the sight of his fag friend's better-looking business card, Bale offers a slicky modulated performance that distills the essence of Bateman, and the book. Published in 1991, American Psycho was Easton Ellis's savage and bloody satire of late 80s extremity. The material fetishism and moral vacuity of the money-drenched, Manhattan-dwelling protagonists were gruesome enough. But it was the lovingly detailed scenes of obscene and often highly sexualised torture and murder (which may or may not have occurred in Bateman's own drug-fuelled imagination) that whipped up a storm of controversy, resulting in accusations of misogyny and exploitation. The screen adaptation is far less graphic. It is the context, rather than the killings themselves, that creates the horror, argues Bale. \"Bateman is neither an anti-hero nor a typical villain. There's no resolution, and his only punishment by the end is his own existence. But the scariness comes from his whole crowd, from that society and their thought processes. Bateman's very much an idiot, and much of the humour comes from the difference in perception between how he views himself and how we view him.\" The basic theme of American Psycho is reason without heart, he says. \"It's like capitalism without any spiritual component.

It's no wonder that in conflicts you get soldiers out of control, doing horrendous things, raping.

In the psychology if not the language of Mr Brown, the sounds of therapeutic Thatcherism, defending the industrial destruction of the early 1980s, begin uncomfortably to echo.</p> <p>He has, of course, a case that's partly irrefutable. The government does have little control. To admit officially that the decimation of Rover had anything to do with the pound would break the market rules which say that politicians opine about currencies at their peril. It cannot be disputed, either, that a lower pound would bring inflationary risks. The hard-won context of stability, avoiding late-Thatcher's boom-and-bust, is enormously worth defending. It shouldn't be jeopardised simply for the sake of saving an industry that has much else going against it as well.</p> <p>But the risks aren't all on one side. This is becoming more painfully apparent every day. After Rover, we may very well give you Ford at Dagenham. There has already been Harland &amp; Wolff in Belfast. The reasons for investing or locating in Britain, while by no means demolished, begin to be eroded. If the pound makes it impossible to expect maximal exports, why not look elsewhere? No responsible businessman can fail to ask the question.

Why shouldn't it? The weak euro has been good for the whole of euroland, the centre and the fringes. Business is booming, and a recovery has begun.

When did the US last have a political convulsion over the weak dollar? If Mr Brown is seriously blaming the British problem on the weak euro, it's to be hoped he's not pinning recovery on a strong one.</p> <p>British interest rates, in other words, look like indefinitely remaining two points higher than in euroland. A double whammy takes shape. Investment in capital, the key to curing our terrible productivity record - 50% worse than the US, 20% than France, 10% than Germany - remains too expensive to make, while investment in the pound is 2% more attractive than in the euro, which ensures that it will remain a barrier to exports. The current account trade deficit is set to rise from zero to \u00a328bn in two years, while Germany and France move into surplus.</p> <p>Why are the great men and women who run the British economy so reluctant to look this combination of downside prospects in the eye? The reason is simple. The scenario invites them to consider the policy that has become once again undiscussable in high political circles, the case for joining the euro.

      "body": "<p> When a \"muckshifter\" lorry left Manchester city centre loaded with contaminated waste, the driver did not know he was being tailed . </p> <p>The Manchester Tippers lorry headed for Europe's largest shopping centre at Trafford Park, and not to a regulated official site. Under watchful eyes a load of soil polluted with arsenic, lead and various sulphates was disposed of on ground being developed for a golf driving range next to the shopping centre. However, at the site the waste was mixed with soil, thus reducing the pollution level to meet with the standards of the environment agency. </p> <p>This meant the owners of the waste were not liable to pay a landfill tax. Rules allow waste from designated contaminated sites to escape tax, provided it is disposed of in a safe way - but usually this done at a very high cost to the developer, not at an \"unofficial\" site. </p> <p>The designated Great Northern railway warehouse site in Manchester had a tax exemption. Biffa Waste Services tendered for the removal contract and was outbid by Manchester Tippers - which quoted a fifth of the price. Biffa , knowing its costings were sound, decided to investigate. Peter Jones, Biffa's external affairs director, said: \"We are talking about potentially polluting materials here - [our bid] is a premium price for what we regard as a premium risk. This is a price-driven market; if [the waste] has not gone to a regulated site, we find out where the stuff does go.\" </p> <p>The Trafford Park site was registered as an exempt site for the dumping only of inert, harmless materials. Biffa complained in April 1999 to the environment agency (set up to police dumping of waste) that Manchester Tippers was in breach of the rules. </p> <p>Surprisingly, the agency replied five weeks later: \"The situation has been investigated - the agency is satisfied the arrangements put in place by the developers comply with the requirements of the duty of care legislation.\" </p> <p>However in an interview with Channel 4's Dispatches programme, the agency admitted it had no idea what had been dumped at Trafford, having done no tests. \"We don't police those sites, we've got no money,\" an official said.

      "bodyText": "When a \"muckshifter\" lorry left Manchester city centre loaded with contaminated waste, the driver did not know he was being tailed . The Manchester Tippers lorry headed for Europe's largest shopping centre at Trafford Park, and not to a regulated official site. Under watchful eyes a load of soil polluted with arsenic, lead and various sulphates was disposed of on ground being developed for a golf driving range next to the shopping centre. However, at the site the waste was mixed with soil, thus reducing the pollution level to meet with the standards of the environment agency. This meant the owners of the waste were not liable to pay a landfill tax. Rules allow waste from designated contaminated sites to escape tax, provided it is disposed of in a safe way - but usually this done at a very high cost to the developer, not at an \"unofficial\" site. The designated Great Northern railway warehouse site in Manchester had a tax exemption. Biffa Waste Services tendered for the removal contract and was outbid by Manchester Tippers - which quoted a fifth of the price. Biffa , knowing its costings were sound, decided to investigate. Peter Jones, Biffa's external affairs director, said: \"We are talking about potentially polluting materials here - [our bid] is a premium price for what we regard as a premium risk. This is a price-driven market; if [the waste] has not gone to a regulated site, we find out where the stuff does go.\" The Trafford Park site was registered as an exempt site for the dumping only of inert, harmless materials. Biffa complained in April 1999 to the environment agency (set up to police dumping of waste) that Manchester Tippers was in breach of the rules. Surprisingly, the agency replied five weeks later: \"The situation has been investigated - the agency is satisfied the arrangements put in place by the developers comply with the requirements of the duty of care legislation.\" However in an interview with Channel 4's Dispatches programme, the agency admitted it had no idea what had been dumped at Trafford, having done no tests. \"We don't police those sites, we've got no money,\" an official said. And he accepted borehole tests at the warehouse site showed higher than acceptable contamination that was against regulations. During these five weeks, however, records kept by Manchester Tippers show 9,902 cubic metres of contaminated waste was moved from the warehouse site to Trafford Park. Morrisons, the company demolishing the site, and Playgolf, the company developing the range, said they acted properly when the waste was moved. \"When it reached Trafford, we carried out twice weekly tests, which suggested contamination below the agency limits. We are satisfied we acted properly,\" said a joint statement. Meanwhile the range next to the shopping centre is going ahead - even though the site contains contaminated materials in breach of regulations for exempt sites. The agency said that, as the data it received showed the contamination was not at dangerous levels, it would take no action. Alastair Hay, an environmental consultant, said: \"In reality, what's happening is taking pollution from one site and dispersing it on another. That's not what the agency recommends, and it's not good practice.\"",

He was given a 28 day suspended sentence for contempt of court after refusing to remove the waste. The company went into liquidation and the dumping stopped -leaving the many tonnes of waste in place. </p> <p>Then a new exercise started, the illegal removing of high quality top soil that remained on the site, and its sale to housing developers. The scale was similar to the dumping and the company involved was Ironside Haulage, owned by the same Harvey Gibson. The council took Ironside Haulage to court and Mr Gibson was fined \u00a31,000.

That is one of the changes that we will look at very carefully,\" he said. No moves are in hand to increase fines or use to customs and excise powers to pounce on firms that evade landfill tax. Mr Jones from Biffa said: \"There should be tougher fines for illegal dumpers. If firms have to lose a huge amount of their turnover for breaching the law, that would be a real deterrent to stop this - \u00a31,000 fines mean nothing.\" Dispatches: Dirty Money, Channel 4, 9pm tonight",

      "body": "<p>Appearing before the trade and industry select committee yesterday, Stephen Byers kept his cool during two hours of close questioning over what he knew and when of the fate of the Rover car plant at Longbridge. He met each MP's gaze and answered calmly, sipping occasionally from a glass of mineral water. And yet, sandwiched between a semi-circle of interrogators and a crush of reporters, civil servants, political opponents and a handful of German observers, he looked very much alone. </p> <p>For all his well-known loyalty to his leader and swift rise to cabinet rank, the trade secretary is being left to take the full force of the flak over the Rover sell-off and consequent thousands of job losses in the West Midlands and elsewhere. </p> <p>Yesterday he lacked even the comfort of officials alongside him to absorb some of the fire, and was forced to rebut accusations that he and his department should have identified the scale of BMW's plans more quickly and reacted accordingly. </p> <p>At question time in the Commons Tony Blair came to his defence as the Tories once more demanded the trade secretary's scalp, but the vote of confidence did not have quite the ring of enthusiasm Mr Byers might have hoped. </p> <p>The bleakest fortnight so far for the trade secretary looks all the worse in the context of his steady promotion. Famously, he transformed himself from a scruffy leftwing councillor from north-east England with an ill-advised moustache, to a smartly-suited moderniser, efficient, trustworthy and with more than a touch of the bureaucrat about him. </p> <p>Vying with his contemporary, fellow north-easterner and moderniser Alan Milburn, for promotion, he skipped early from education into the cabinet as chief secretary to the Treasury (150 days ahead of his rival), moving into the DTI slot in December 1998 after Peter Mandelson's downfall. </p> <p>Labour MPs monitoring Mr Byers's progress agree that things have begun to fall apart this year precisely because of the scale of his good fortune so far. One said: \"Byers, and Milburn too, are both going to be done in, make no mistake. They played along with a very, very dangerous game and they are reaping the effects of that.\" </p> <p>All the talk of the pair's role as the next Blair and Brown has ultimately led knives to be sharpened at the very top of the party, MPs say. </p> <p>While Milburn has seen his health portfolio somewhat usurped as the prime minister seizes \"personal responsibility\" for the area, Byers is perceived to have suffered the greater backlash. The source of a series of unfavourable stories against him in recent months, observers agree, is not far from number 11 Downing Street, where the chancellor is said to be keen to ensure the trade secretary does not get above himself. </p> <p>\"Byers did not speak in the budget debate and that was down to Gordon,\" said one MP sympathetic to the trade secretary. \"There have been one or two little things coming from Gordon's side, and it is all because Byers is viewed as one of the heirs.\" </p> <p>\"I would not be putting too much money on the long-term future of these guys,\" said a generally loyal MP, referring to both Byers and Milburn. </p> <p>Most, however, have less harsh predictions. The trade secretary's job is secure at present - not least because the Conservatives have failed to target their attacks with precision. </p> <p>Rover's demise has been a bleak chapter for Stephen Byers and one which will scar him, even if ultimately it does no more than slow or perhaps level off his ascent through the government ranks. Only if there are more such disasters in British manufacturing - if Ford's Dagenham plant, for example, were to be hit - would his fate look permanently grim.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Appearing before the trade and industry select committee yesterday, Stephen Byers kept his cool during two hours of close questioning over what he knew and when of the fate of the Rover car plant at Longbridge. He met each MP's gaze and answered calmly, sipping occasionally from a glass of mineral water. And yet, sandwiched between a semi-circle of interrogators and a crush of reporters, civil servants, political opponents and a handful of German observers, he looked very much alone. For all his well-known loyalty to his leader and swift rise to cabinet rank, the trade secretary is being left to take the full force of the flak over the Rover sell-off and consequent thousands of job losses in the West Midlands and elsewhere. Yesterday he lacked even the comfort of officials alongside him to absorb some of the fire, and was forced to rebut accusations that he and his department should have identified the scale of BMW's plans more quickly and reacted accordingly. At question time in the Commons Tony Blair came to his defence as the Tories once more demanded the trade secretary's scalp, but the vote of confidence did not have quite the ring of enthusiasm Mr Byers might have hoped. The bleakest fortnight so far for the trade secretary looks all the worse in the context of his steady promotion. Famously, he transformed himself from a scruffy leftwing councillor from north-east England with an ill-advised moustache, to a smartly-suited moderniser, efficient, trustworthy and with more than a touch of the bureaucrat about him. Vying with his contemporary, fellow north-easterner and moderniser Alan Milburn, for promotion, he skipped early from education into the cabinet as chief secretary to the Treasury (150 days ahead of his rival), moving into the DTI slot in December 1998 after Peter Mandelson's downfall. Labour MPs monitoring Mr Byers's progress agree that things have begun to fall apart this year precisely because of the scale of his good fortune so far. One said: \"Byers, and Milburn too, are both going to be done in, make no mistake. They played along with a very, very dangerous game and they are reaping the effects of that.\" All the talk of the pair's role as the next Blair and Brown has ultimately led knives to be sharpened at the very top of the party, MPs say. While Milburn has seen his health portfolio somewhat usurped as the prime minister seizes \"personal responsibility\" for the area, Byers is perceived to have suffered the greater backlash. The source of a series of unfavourable stories against him in recent months, observers agree, is not far from number 11 Downing Street, where the chancellor is said to be keen to ensure the trade secretary does not get above himself. \"Byers did not speak in the budget debate and that was down to Gordon,\" said one MP sympathetic to the trade secretary. \"There have been one or two little things coming from Gordon's side, and it is all because Byers is viewed as one of the heirs.\" \"I would not be putting too much money on the long-term future of these guys,\" said a generally loyal MP, referring to both Byers and Milburn. Most, however, have less harsh predictions. The trade secretary's job is secure at present - not least because the Conservatives have failed to target their attacks with precision. Rover's demise has been a bleak chapter for Stephen Byers and one which will scar him, even if ultimately it does no more than slow or perhaps level off his ascent through the government ranks. Only if there are more such disasters in British manufacturing - if Ford's Dagenham plant, for example, were to be hit - would his fate look permanently grim.",

But the Department of Health postponed a decision on the cloning of embryos to obtain stem cells - the earliest, basic cells created by the division of the fertilised egg. </p> <p>These have the potential to grow into any part of the human body, such as muscle, heart or nerves. </p> <p>A draft of the paper on stem cell research released yesterday by the Nuffield Council was submitted to the Donaldson committee in November. It looks at a number of methods of obtaining stem cells and concludes that it is ethically acceptable to take them from either donated embryos or embryos cloned by replacing the nucleus of an egg with DNA from a patient. </p> <p>Such research \"does not indicate lack of respect for the embryo\", says the paper, adding that the embryo is not destined to become a human being and would otherwise perish. </p> <p>Sandy Thomas, director of the council, said yesterday that it was possible that growing tissue from an embryo cloned from a transplant patient might be the most useful way forward because it would provide an exact match. </p> <p>\"Some researchers believe it holds the most promise,\" she said. \"If it works, it would get around the whole problem of graft rejection.\" </p> <p>There was little doubt within the scientific community that this sort of research should be permitted, Dr Thomas said. \"There is a lot of support among scientists who are involved in this work.\" </p> <p>In theory, stem cells could be used not only to grow new hearts but also - and probably sooner - to develop therapies for debilitating diseases such as Parkinson's, stroke and rheumatoid arthritis, by regenerating cell growth in damaged areas. Cells from aborted foetuses have already been implanted in the brains of people with Parkinson's disease. </p> <p>The council says there should be no need to create embryos for research purposes. Women who undergo fertility treatment are asked if they want to donate unused embryos to science, but under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act those embryos can only be used for research into fertility problems and congenital disease. </p> <p>The council recommends that the act be amended to allow these embryos to be used in stem cell research. \"We consider that the proposed creation of embryos using SCNT [somatic cell nuclear transfer, or cloning] for research into the derivation of stem cells offers such significant potential medical benefits that research for such purposes should be licensed,\" the paper says. </p> <p>But there is a caveat. Women who donate embryos must give consent for their use in stem cell research, the council insists, because the DNA in the material could be traced back to donors. </p> <p>Dr Thomas said a lot more research into stem cell therapies was needed. She hoped the government would give serious consideration to changing the law.</p>",

These have the potential to grow into any part of the human body, such as muscle, heart or nerves. A draft of the paper on stem cell research released yesterday by the Nuffield Council was submitted to the Donaldson committee in November. It looks at a number of methods of obtaining stem cells and concludes that it is ethically acceptable to take them from either donated embryos or embryos cloned by replacing the nucleus of an egg with DNA from a patient. Such research \"does not indicate lack of respect for the embryo\", says the paper, adding that the embryo is not destined to become a human being and would otherwise perish. Sandy Thomas, director of the council, said yesterday that it was possible that growing tissue from an embryo cloned from a transplant patient might be the most useful way forward because it would provide an exact match. \"Some researchers believe it holds the most promise,\" she said. \"If it works, it would get around the whole problem of graft rejection.\" There was little doubt within the scientific community that this sort of research should be permitted, Dr Thomas said. \"There is a lot of support among scientists who are involved in this work.\" In theory, stem cells could be used not only to grow new hearts but also - and probably sooner - to develop therapies for debilitating diseases such as Parkinson's, stroke and rheumatoid arthritis, by regenerating cell growth in damaged areas. Cells from aborted foetuses have already been implanted in the brains of people with Parkinson's disease. The council says there should be no need to create embryos for research purposes. Women who undergo fertility treatment are asked if they want to donate unused embryos to science, but under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act those embryos can only be used for research into fertility problems and congenital disease. The council recommends that the act be amended to allow these embryos to be used in stem cell research. \"We consider that the proposed creation of embryos using SCNT [somatic cell nuclear transfer, or cloning] for research into the derivation of stem cells offers such significant potential medical benefits that research for such purposes should be licensed,\" the paper says. But there is a caveat. Women who donate embryos must give consent for their use in stem cell research, the council insists, because the DNA in the material could be traced back to donors. Dr Thomas said a lot more research into stem cell therapies was needed. She hoped the government would give serious consideration to changing the law.",

      "bodyText": "Taiwan's president-elect, Chen Shui-bian, may invite the Dalai Lama to attend his inauguration, but will consider China's attitude before making a final decision, a spokesman said yesterday. \"There have been proposals to invite the Dalai Lama, but we have yet to finalise the invitation list,\" said Li Wang-tai, spokesman for the Democratic Progressive party (DPP), which swept Mr Chen to power in presidential elections last month. A Hong Kong television channel reported that an invitation had already been sent to the Dalai Lama, who was said to be unable to attend the event on May 20. The Dalai Lama \"will not attend the inauguration because this conflicts with his planned European visit\", the channel quoted a spokesman at the Dalai Lama's office as saying. The spokesman reportedly denied that the Tibetan spiritual leader was under pressure from Beijing to stay away. On Tuesday, China criticised reported plans by the Dalai Lama to visit Taiwan, saying he would use the trip to promote separatism. Mr Li said the DPP was aware that China opposed a visit by the Dalai Lama, but added: \"Being the president-elect, Chen Shui-bian has the right to decide who to invite to his inauguration.\" The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader visited Taiwan in March 1997, his first trip to Chinese territory since fleeing his homeland with thousands of followers in 1959 after an anti-Communist uprising failed. Beijing later condemned the 1997 visit, saying it was aimed at severing both Tibet and Taiwan from China. Mr Li said the DPP would consider China's attitude as it drew up the invitation list but added that \"we shouldn't quit just because we are afraid of being criticised\". The DPP has always campaigned for independence from China and was seen by many as Beijing's least favoured party, though Mr Chen soft-pedalled the issue during his presidential campaign. Beijing, which sees Taiwan as a breakaway province which must be brought under its rule - by force if necessary - has said it would watch Mr Chen's words and deeds.",

Under the plan, the home secretary, Jack Straw, would present a multi-choice bill to parliament which would give MPs the chance to vote on options ranging from an outright ban on fox hunting to leaving the law unchanged. It is designed to take the wind out of the sails of staunch Conservative supporters of fox-hunting, who have vowed to use every parliamentary trick at their disposal to block any ban. Mr Straw's bill is modelled on the multi-choice bill which John Major's government presented to MPs in 1993 to resolve the impasse on Sunday trading. The Conservative government gave MPs four options which ranged from total deregulation to keeping most shops closed. Michael Foster, Labour MP for Worcester, whose anti-fox hunting bill failed to make it onto the statute book despite winning the overwhelming support of Labour MPs in 1997, said he was encouraged by Mr Straw's initiative. \"This would enable people like me to vote for a ban while lessening the opposition in the Lords, because a range of views would have been taken into account,\" Mr Foster said. The new bill, which would be allocated government time - unlike Mr Foster's ill-fated private member's bill - would probably be introduced after the general election. By then the former treasury mandarin, Lord Burns, will have produced his report on the employment implications of a ban. His inquiry is expected to recommend proposals backed by the Middle Way pressure group to license hunts. Labour MPs have turned their attention to Mr Straw's proposal because an attempt by Ken Livingstone, MP for Brent East, to introduce a new private member's bill will fail. His bill is likely to run into trouble in the Commons tomorrow because it is due to be debated after another private member's bill, introduced by the pro-hunting MP Iain Duncan Smith, shadow defence secretary. He is expected to attempt to undermine Mr Livingstone's chances of success by prolonging his debate. Labour MPs who voted for Mr Foster's bill said yesterday that they would turn up tomorrow despite Mr Livingstone's decision to abandon the party. Harry Barnes, MP for Derbyshire North East, said: \"I stick by my principle of opposing fox hunting.\"",

      "bodyText": "There is more scientific and anecdotal evidence available about the health effects of mobile phones than GM food and the equivalent of GM field trials in mobile phone technology has been you and me since 1984 (Hands-free mobiles 'increase radiation risk', April 4). Have the NRPB, Which and NPL when undertaking SAR tests (specific absorption rates) on laboratory dummy heads also considered that in the real world we have metal fillings, facial and body piercing, children with dental braces and metal rimmed spectacles? All of which would affect SARs and hence brain functions. Should the telecoms industry and government be trusted in matters of public health when \u00a311bn is on the table in the auction for new mobile phone frequencies? Phone masts next to schools and hospitals is an appalling indictment of profit before people. I worked for seven years installing and using mobile phone equipment until 1990 and have had appalling illhealth ever since including the \"usual\" chronic tiredness, short-term memory problems, sleep patterns that leave me exhausted and a permanent ringing in the head. \"Gagging\" clauses have silenced telecoms workers who fall ill with microwave sickness so cases do not get to court. All schools and libraries are to be microwave-linked to enable \"access for all to the internet\". I would expect nothing less than microwave emission standards that are the safest in the world (not NRPBs) and that the opportunity is used to locate monitoring equipment of microwave levels from mobile phone sources, especially near schools and hospitals. Jim Mochnacz Street, Somerset jim.mochnacz@ukonline.co.uk \u0095 Should not the government insist that the mobile phone companies use satellite relays, rather than the masts that will soon be sprouting like mushrooms every 200 yards? We may not be able to escape the phones, but we might be able to avoid the relay aerials. Julian Dunn Oxford eisendora@compuserve.com \u0095 Julie Burchill (Slaves to the mobile, G2, April 5) is, of course, correct, mobile phones are an intrusion and, most certainly, a symbol of enslavement rather than a status symbol. However, as a recently qualified mature graduate the first thing I was asked when I tried to sign on with staff agencies was: \"what's your mobile number?\" Working eight to 12 hours a day in various menial capacities means that I am dependent on the thing to arrange, and be on hand to discuss, freelance work during office hours.

To refute her image of all of us hanging around polishing our nails, it is artists, many of whom donated work to Monday's auction, who have been at the forefront of the free entry campaign for museums. Artists, more than anyone, know that it is vitally important that art should be available free to all. As she claims artists have no \"political sense\", we should surely get rid of Goya's Disasters Of War and Picasso's Guernica from the art history books. <br><br><b>Peter Kennard</b><br> Contributing artist and co-organiser, London Calling</p> <p>\u0095 What excellent reasons Tracey Emin gives for supporting Ken Livingstone. It might have been said by any number of people sending in their contribution to Ken's campaign. People give their support to politicians for all sorts of reasons, most of which would probably irritate Polly Toynbee. Somebody might even make a contribution because he doesn't like an opponent's comment about the colour of his hair.</p> <p>As for her call to artists to campaign for free museum entry, they are. Except that such entry concerns far more than artists, since plenty of charging museums have nothing to do with the arts and plenty of visitors are not artists. Which does not stop artists from supporting Ken Livingstone because, in addition to the good reasons Tracey Emin has given, Livingstone is a vigorous opponent of museum charging.</p> <p>Perhaps if Labour, and Tony Blair in particular, had not been so implacably opposed to artists' interests, they might have been more sympathetic. Take artists' resale royalties. Blair is adamant that artists should not enjoy a royalty of 2% on the resale of their work, on the grounds that this would damage the art trade. But when one of our big auction houses announces recently that it is increasing its own premium by the same percentage, where is the prime minister? <br><br><b>Ren\u00e9 Gimpel</b><br> Gimpel Fils gallery</p>",

To refute her image of all of us hanging around polishing our nails, it is artists, many of whom donated work to Monday's auction, who have been at the forefront of the free entry campaign for museums. Artists, more than anyone, know that it is vitally important that art should be available free to all. As she claims artists have no \"political sense\", we should surely get rid of Goya's Disasters Of War and Picasso's Guernica from the art history books. Peter Kennard Contributing artist and co-organiser, London Calling \u0095 What excellent reasons Tracey Emin gives for supporting Ken Livingstone. It might have been said by any number of people sending in their contribution to Ken's campaign. People give their support to politicians for all sorts of reasons, most of which would probably irritate Polly Toynbee. Somebody might even make a contribution because he doesn't like an opponent's comment about the colour of his hair. As for her call to artists to campaign for free museum entry, they are. Except that such entry concerns far more than artists, since plenty of charging museums have nothing to do with the arts and plenty of visitors are not artists. Which does not stop artists from supporting Ken Livingstone because, in addition to the good reasons Tracey Emin has given, Livingstone is a vigorous opponent of museum charging. Perhaps if Labour, and Tony Blair in particular, had not been so implacably opposed to artists' interests, they might have been more sympathetic. Take artists' resale royalties. Blair is adamant that artists should not enjoy a royalty of 2% on the resale of their work, on the grounds that this would damage the art trade. But when one of our big auction houses announces recently that it is increasing its own premium by the same percentage, where is the prime minister? Ren\u00e9 Gimpel Gimpel Fils gallery",

      "bodyText": "An organisation set up to hunt down the Iraqi leadership for alleged human rights abuses claimed yesterday it was poised to indict the first member of the regime. The British-based organisation Indict, which was awarded $2m in funding by US Congress, said it had accumulated enough evidence to make a case stick against an Iraqi accused of torture. Fearful of the Iraqi intelligence service, Indict operates from a secret location in London and carefully guards the identity of its staff. The Labour MP Ann Clwyd, who is president of the organisation and has long campaigned on behalf of the Iraqi Kurds and other victims of the regime, said yesterday: \"We are excited at the quality of evidence we are getting which we hope will enable us to indict.\" To prevent a recurrence of an episode last August in which a senior member of the Iraqi government, Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, fled from Vienna 24 hours before legal action was initiated, secrecy is paramount and even Ms Clwyd does not know the identity of the Iraqi being targeted or in which country the indictment will take place. But she said the indictment would be \"soon, within the next few weeks or months\". Staff at Indict's office were more secretive, uneasy that Ms Clwyd had gone too far. Indict, which was set up in 1996, aims to mount an operation similar to that which led to the arrest of General Augusto Pinochet in Britain but hopes to secure a successful prosecution. On a wider front, Indict is lobbying, alongside the US, for the UN security council to set up a war crimes tribunal for Iraq similar to the ones for Rwanda and the Balkans. Ms Clwyd said: \"We want to send a signal to the Iraqi government that there are no safe hiding places anywhere in the world for those charged with the horrendous crimes of Saddam Hussein and those round him.\" She said she found it extraordinary, given the scale of the accusations against them, that members of the regime could travel freely round the world. Although the US state department agreed to provide $2m two years ago, the first tranche of that money - $600,385 - only came through last July. Since that time, Indict's eight-strong team has gathered evidence from around the world and made clandestine trips to Iraq. Indict insisted it had not been ready for Mr al-Douri as it had only received the funding from the US the previous month and had not accumulated the evidence necessary to make a convincing case. The top 12 on Indict's wanted list are: President Saddam Hussein; two former heads of the intelligence service, Barzan al-Tikriti and Sab'awi Ibrahim al-Hassan; Saddam's two sons, Uday and Qusay; Ali Hassan al-Majid, the former Iraqi commander in Iraqi Kurdistan and first governor of Iraqi-occupied Kuwait; Mohammed al-Zubaydi, who took part in the coup that brought Saddam to power; Aziz Salih al-Noman, Saddam's former special adviser; Tariq Aziz, the deputy prime minister; Mr al-Douri, the former interior minister; Watban al-Tikriti, a former interior minister; and Ta Ha Yassin Ramadan, the vice-president. The accusations range from actions against the Iraqi Kurds in the 1980s to those against the Marsh Arabs in the 1990s. The organisation said indictment was possible under various international laws, such as the genocide, Geneva and torture conventions. Indict, whose board includes the former US ambassador Peter Galbraith and the former British ambassador Sir John Morgan as well as leaders of the Iraqi opposition, has had a short but turbulent history. It has had a torrid time in the last year trying to establish credibility: questions have been raised about why the US should fund an organisation headed by a leftwing Labour backbencher and there have been rows over money. Legal action is being taken by Ms Clwyd over articles in Punch and Private Eye. US state department officials visited the office yesterday to check on progress. Ms Clwyd said of the internal rows: \"Of course, in any multicultural organisation there are going to be different norms of behaviour and it is sometimes difficult to balance people's expectations and desire to indict.\" But she said the arrival last year of the money from the US and the employment of Tony Cunningham, a former Labour Euro MP, as chief of staff - the only member of staff prepared to be named publicly - had helped create a tightly run organisation. In addition to the $600,385 from the US, Indict has received $600,000 from an anonymous backer, whom Ms Clwyd is prepared to disclose privately but not publicly. Indict claimed the necessary majority for the establishment of a war crimes tribunal existed on the UN security council but the danger was of one of the permanent members exercising its veto.

They decided to go their own way one night after Seidel overheard a male punter calling them the \"Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders.\" Seidel says, \"I just wanted to shove my bow up his ass.\" Their exuberant new country pop soon caught on, and their top label debut, Wide Open Spaces, won two 1999 Grammys and became the bestselling release by a group in country music history. The follow-up, Fly, which features the offending single, has already sold more than 4m copies.</p> <p>The US country music industry traditionally liked its women long-suffering, submissive and sweet, but the indications are that radio programmers and the good old boys of Nashville are out of step with the new female artists. \"The majority of female country stars are not the withering flowers they once were,\" says the US entertainment writer, Don Moorhouse. \"You have artists like Wynona and Mary Chapin Carpenter, whose approach to songs is very affirmative, very self-willed.\"</p> <p>The debate over the Dixie Chicks's song has spread from Nashville and become a national hot potato. \"We've supported the song, we feel it works well,\" says Chip Miller, programme director for Kix County Radio in Massachusetts. \"Some people have complained that it glamorises killing.

Until the 80s, religious fundamentalism dominated the genre, and Nashville was intensely conservative.</p> <p>Fifties female star Patsy Cline, for instance, literally broke her neck trying to keep her various marriages together while tearing around promoting her records. Once after a car accident, she went into the recording studio with her broken ribs barely healed. The brassy, braided cowgirl from Virginia was killed in 1963 at the age of 30 in a plane crash, in a mad hurry to get home through wintry fog to cook the dinner. Cline's life was a wrestling match between her desire to be a star and a moral imperative that expected her to be at home tending to her man.</p> <p>Tammy Wynette also typified the old country view of woman-as-victim. Her second husband, songwriter Don Chapel, traded nude photos of her via porn magazines, and when her 1969 anthem Stand By Your Man was at the top of the charts she was being beaten and bruised by her third husband, the country star George Jones, who was famous for his drunken benders. When she met her last husband, producer George Richey, Wynette claimed she felt as contented as a little girl, \"when Daddy was always there to take care of me\". She died two years ago, aged 55, after years of severe stomach ailments and an addiction to painkillers. Right up to her death she was pasting on a smile and performing, even though she looked like a walking cadaver.</p> <p>Previously portrayed in songs as angels of the hearth or downtrodden, hapless victims of men, it is fair to deduce that women have not had an easy ride in country music. Country originated from working class hillbilly folk music, and reflected some of the more reactionary aspects of that culture. But in the same way that women have hit back in hip hop against misogynist rap, with strong, dignified figures such as Queen Latifah, there are a steadily growing number of women in country music who fight fire with fire.</p> <p>A strongly male-dominated genre seems to breed rebellion. For every George Jones crooning about the little wifey at home, there was a self-possessed woman itching to sing about her life. Country music is, after all, meant to be about direct, down-home honesty.</p> <p>Dolly Parton was one of the first to break the mould, launching an attack on sexual double standards with her 1967 hit Dumb Blonde. Although she presented an exaggerated version of femininity, with her wasp waist, bouffant hair and balloon-shaped bust, Parton was adept at sending herself up. A shrewd, self-made woman from poverty-stricken Tennessee, she sang of women's independence. Parton proved early on that it was possible for a woman to be a prolific songwriter and a successful country star on her own terms.</p> <p>These days, a new country act doesn't have to disguise assertiveness behind a blonde beehive, though there is still pressure to sing formulaic love ditties. Women such as Shania Twain and Mindy McCready have found the commercial route to be most effective, but other artists remain committed to singing realistically about romance and relationships.

Intensely personal and melancholic, it would have been too outre, too angry, for the more conservative companies of Music City.</p> <p>Female country artists have become more defiant, yet they still have to be careful about who they might offend.

The families have been seeking the truth since they started their campaign 20 years ago.\"</p> <p>But Lord Williams told the families not to expect the impossible. \"There will never be an absolute certainty about what happened during the last few minutes when the Derbyshire sank because there is no means of knowing for sure,\" he said.</p> <p>In 1998 the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, ordered the formal investigation to be reopened.</p> <p>The Derbyshire was one of six identical vessels built in Teesside by Swan Hunter shipbuilders in the late 1970s.

      "bodyText": "The families of the victims of the MV Derbyshire were praised yesterday as a new inquiry began in London into the sinking of the biggest British vessel lost at sea. Attorney general Lord Williams paid tribute to the families' \"persistence and fortitude\" in bringing about the second inquiry into why the 169,000-tonne bulk carrier sank in 1980 in a typhoon in the Pacific Ocean off Japan with the loss of all 42 of its British crew and two wives. Stephen Cantor, solicitor for the Derbyshire Families Association, said: \"Everyone is hopeful there will be a proper outcome to the investigation and that the true reason for the loss of the Derbyshire comes out. The families have been seeking the truth since they started their campaign 20 years ago.\" But Lord Williams told the families not to expect the impossible. \"There will never be an absolute certainty about what happened during the last few minutes when the Derbyshire sank because there is no means of knowing for sure,\" he said. In 1998 the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, ordered the formal investigation to be reopened. The Derbyshire was one of six identical vessels built in Teesside by Swan Hunter shipbuilders in the late 1970s. The Tory administration ruled out an investigation as impractical and it was only after a sister ship, the Kowloon Bridge, went aground off the coast of Ireland in 1986 that the first public inquiry into the Derbyshire began. That inquiry, completed seven years before the wreckage of the Derbyshire was located, concluded that the vessel was \"probably overwhelmed by the forces of nature\" when waves up to 80ft high pounded the ship.",

They say welfare has been given a low priority by producers in the search for ever-quicker growing birds, causing widespread lameness and heart and skin disorders. The scientists blame much of the problem on overcrowding of poultry houses, and advocate the need for cuts in stocking rates of between 10% and 20%, a move that the British poultry industry warned could put many farms out of business. Their conclusions go much further than the voluntary minimum standards for home producers published last week with government approval. Animal welfare groups welcomed what they believe is a landmark report from the European commission's animal health and animal welfare committee on conditions in broiler houses packed with thousands of birds. It will now be considered by commissioners and individual governments. It follows damning indictments from EU vets on standards of hygiene in poultry slaughterhouses in several EU states, including Britain. The food standards agency has also attacked high levels of salmonella.

It is currently being minded by a builder, Paul Keating, who is living in one of its outhouses. Mr Keating is suing a friend of Mr Zardari's, Javaid Pasha, for \u00a3375,000, which he claims he is owed for renovation work.</p> <p>Last month Mr Keating was interviewed in London by Pakistan's two leading anti-corruption investigators, Lieutenant General Syed Mohammad Amjad, chairman of the NAB, and Farouk Adam Khan, the NAB's prosecutor in chief.</p> <p>The NAB was set up by General Pervez Musharraf, who led last October's coup, to investigate allegations of corruption in Mrs Bhutto's administration, and that of her successor, Nawaz Sharif.</p> <p>Mr Keating, who met the men separately at the Pakistani high commission, was asked to provide details of the people he worked for and the building work carried out on Rockwood House.</p> <p>Mr Keating told them that the project was top secret. He said he was \"in no doubt\" that Rockwood House was bought by Mr Zardari and that he intended to move to the mansion, which boasts nine bedrooms, an indoor swimming pool, stables and polo pitches.</p> <p>He told them Mr Zardari was in overall charge of the refurbishment - approving designs and visiting the site to make sure the work was going according to schedule.</p> <p>Mr Zardari has been in jail since November 1996 accused of making millions from illegal kickbacks which he received from government contracts.</p> <p>When Mr Keating became caretaker of the property, he found a framed picture of Mrs Bhutto and a commemorative plate, on which her name was engraved, locked in the safe.</p> <p>He also found a plaque displaying two first world war bayonets. Its inscription read: \"Presented to Asif Zardari from Wilkinson's Swords.\"</p> <p>He showed Farouk Adam Khan photographs of artefacts, wooden carvings and precious stones that were left in the house and was told that some of them were stolen from a museum in Pakistan.</p> <p>Mr Keating has agreed to fly to Pakistan to give evidence in any forthcoming trials.</p> <p>Mrs Bhutto has strongly denied that she knew anything about the purchase of Rockwood House.</p> <p>She told the Guardian: \"I have never even been to Surrey. I don't know anything about this house. I have been told by people for a long time that my husband bought the house. I have asked my husband on 10 occasions if this is true and he said it is not. I have never seen the paperwork to prove it. I do not believe he had anything to do with it.\"</p> <p>Mr Keating said yesterday: \"The NAB believes Rockwood House was bought by Mr Zardari with corrupt money, and therefore the property is owned by the Pakistani people.</p> <p>\"They told me they want to use Rockwood House as an auxiliary to the high commission, like our prime minister uses Chequers. I was appointed to look after Rockwood House by associates of Mr Zardari 18 months ago, but nobody has contacted me since. If the high commission does come here, I can't imagine anyone coming forward to complain.\"</p> <p>Mr Keating is suing Mr Pasha and his wife Shabnam, and their company FMS International, claiming that they masterminded the renovation work on behalf of Mr Zardari.</p> <p>Mr Pasha is defending the claim on the basis that he was not acting as an agent for Mr Zardari and does not know who bought the property.</p> <p>The next hearing in the case is due at the central London county court in five weeks.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Pakistan's military government is drawing up plans to move part of its high commission in London to a mansion in Surrey which was allegedly bought and renovated by Benazir Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari, with money made in corrupt deals while the couple were in power, the Guardian has learned. The plan to turn Rockwood House near Brook into an out of town residence and country club has been mooted as a way of \"flushing out\" the real owners of the \u00a34.5m property. If anyone does come forward to claim ownership, Pakistan's national accountability bureau will seek to question them about the estate, which was bought by an offshore firm, Romina Properties, five years ago. Refurbishment of the mansion was abandoned in October 1996, shortly before Mrs Bhutto's government fell from power. It is currently being minded by a builder, Paul Keating, who is living in one of its outhouses. Mr Keating is suing a friend of Mr Zardari's, Javaid Pasha, for \u00a3375,000, which he claims he is owed for renovation work. Last month Mr Keating was interviewed in London by Pakistan's two leading anti-corruption investigators, Lieutenant General Syed Mohammad Amjad, chairman of the NAB, and Farouk Adam Khan, the NAB's prosecutor in chief. The NAB was set up by General Pervez Musharraf, who led last October's coup, to investigate allegations of corruption in Mrs Bhutto's administration, and that of her successor, Nawaz Sharif. Mr Keating, who met the men separately at the Pakistani high commission, was asked to provide details of the people he worked for and the building work carried out on Rockwood House. Mr Keating told them that the project was top secret. He said he was \"in no doubt\" that Rockwood House was bought by Mr Zardari and that he intended to move to the mansion, which boasts nine bedrooms, an indoor swimming pool, stables and polo pitches. He told them Mr Zardari was in overall charge of the refurbishment - approving designs and visiting the site to make sure the work was going according to schedule. Mr Zardari has been in jail since November 1996 accused of making millions from illegal kickbacks which he received from government contracts. When Mr Keating became caretaker of the property, he found a framed picture of Mrs Bhutto and a commemorative plate, on which her name was engraved, locked in the safe. He also found a plaque displaying two first world war bayonets. Its inscription read: \"Presented to Asif Zardari from Wilkinson's Swords.\" He showed Farouk Adam Khan photographs of artefacts, wooden carvings and precious stones that were left in the house and was told that some of them were stolen from a museum in Pakistan. Mr Keating has agreed to fly to Pakistan to give evidence in any forthcoming trials. Mrs Bhutto has strongly denied that she knew anything about the purchase of Rockwood House. She told the Guardian: \"I have never even been to Surrey. I don't know anything about this house. I have been told by people for a long time that my husband bought the house. I have asked my husband on 10 occasions if this is true and he said it is not. I have never seen the paperwork to prove it. I do not believe he had anything to do with it.\" Mr Keating said yesterday: \"The NAB believes Rockwood House was bought by Mr Zardari with corrupt money, and therefore the property is owned by the Pakistani people. \"They told me they want to use Rockwood House as an auxiliary to the high commission, like our prime minister uses Chequers. I was appointed to look after Rockwood House by associates of Mr Zardari 18 months ago, but nobody has contacted me since. If the high commission does come here, I can't imagine anyone coming forward to complain.\" Mr Keating is suing Mr Pasha and his wife Shabnam, and their company FMS International, claiming that they masterminded the renovation work on behalf of Mr Zardari. Mr Pasha is defending the claim on the basis that he was not acting as an agent for Mr Zardari and does not know who bought the property. The next hearing in the case is due at the central London county court in five weeks.",

Addressing the annual congress of the Royal College of Nursing in Bournemouth, the minister twice spoke of the prospect of free nursing care for all older people. In a reference to the college's policy that nursing care should be free, wherever delivered, Mr Milburn said: \"Your views are very close to my own on this issue.\" The government has delayed for more than a year any decision on a report of the royal commission on long-term care, which recommended that \"personal\" care should be free. At present some 42,500 people in nursing homes have to pay for all their care. The report said the concession, which would meet about 60% of a typical nursing home charge of \u00a3350 a week, would help some of the estimated 40,000 people a year who sell their homes to pay for nursing or residential care. The cost of the change was put at an initial \u00a31.2bn a year. Personal care would include not only nursing, but also dressing, feeding and bathing. The RCN says nursing care could be provided free at an annual cost of \u00a3220m to \u00a3600m.

He also announced new standards of ward cleanliness, the first for 25 years; a further expansion of nurse prescribing; and a programme of investment in housing for nurses - \"not a return to the old style nurses' home\" - to be led by John Yates, newly appointed national nurse housing co-ordinator. Today the Department of Health is expected to publish consultative proposals for a NHS workforce planning body, designed to ensure that doctor numbers increase in step with numbers of nurses and other health workers.

Whereas delegates voted by 82% to express no confidence in Mr Hague's assurances on Tory health policy, they gave a 63% vote of confidence in the health secretary.

The exhibition, at the National Library of Wales, in Aberystwyth, opens to the public on Saturday and runs until the end of September.",

Word was then leaked to a recently retired colleague of McGuinness called Kevin Garner, who was the original target of the CIB3 operation.</p> <p>The men were filmed stealing the cannabis from the flat and four days later both were arrested.</p> <p>In May 1998 McGuinness, who had initially denied the charges, became one of CIB3's top supergrasses as he fingered dozens of flying squad officers for alleged corruption.</p> <p>More than 80 officers accused by McGuinness and Garner, who also turned supergrass, were suspended but were later told by the crown prosecution service that there would be no further action.</p> <p>Both the prosecution and defence insisted that McGuinness had told the truth to CIB3 and was willing to give evidence. The CPS, however, never called McGuinness as a witness in any corruption trial.</p> <p>In mitigation, his defence barrister, John Coffey, said his client had encountered a \"culture of corruption\" at the flying squad and wanted to \"fit in\" with his colleagues.</p> <p>McGuinness, who is married with children, is likely to serve six years with the time he has already spent in custody counting against his sentence.</p> <p>This is a heavier sentence than the one received by another CIB3 supergrass, former Met detective Neil Putnam, whose sentence was reduced from 12 years to less than four after pleading guilty and testifying against two colleagues.</p> <p>The Guardian has learned from senior Met officers that they are \"not happy\" with the current supergrass system relied on by CIB3. The home secretary, Jack Straw, has refused a request by the Labour MP Andrew Mackinlay to launch an independent judicial inquiry into the conduct of CIB3 after a Guardian investigation last month.</p> <p>It revealed that CIB3 officers were using discredited practices, including the supergrass system. CIB3 is now the subject of three internal inquiries following the collapse of four high profile trials against serving and former Met detectives. The cleared officers are not satisfied by the existing complaints procedure and point to double standards and score-settling at the heart of CIB3.</p> <p>Mr Straw told Mr Mackinlay he is awaiting the outcome of a review of the police complaints procedure undertaken by international auditors and consultants KPMG in response to the Stephen Lawrence inquiry.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A corrupt Metropolitan police detective turned supergrass was yesterday jailed for nine years at the Old Bailey. Terry McGuinness, 42, had previously pleaded guilty to nine counts of corruption spanning six years which he mostly served at the flying squad in London. The corruption offences included burglary, conspiracy to supply 80kg of cannabis, handling stolen goods and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. McGuinness confessed after a sting operation by the Met's anti-corruption branch, CIB3, in December 1997. Officers had planted 80 bars of cannabis inside a bathroom cabinet in an east London flat. Word was then leaked to a recently retired colleague of McGuinness called Kevin Garner, who was the original target of the CIB3 operation. The men were filmed stealing the cannabis from the flat and four days later both were arrested. In May 1998 McGuinness, who had initially denied the charges, became one of CIB3's top supergrasses as he fingered dozens of flying squad officers for alleged corruption. More than 80 officers accused by McGuinness and Garner, who also turned supergrass, were suspended but were later told by the crown prosecution service that there would be no further action. Both the prosecution and defence insisted that McGuinness had told the truth to CIB3 and was willing to give evidence. The CPS, however, never called McGuinness as a witness in any corruption trial. In mitigation, his defence barrister, John Coffey, said his client had encountered a \"culture of corruption\" at the flying squad and wanted to \"fit in\" with his colleagues. McGuinness, who is married with children, is likely to serve six years with the time he has already spent in custody counting against his sentence. This is a heavier sentence than the one received by another CIB3 supergrass, former Met detective Neil Putnam, whose sentence was reduced from 12 years to less than four after pleading guilty and testifying against two colleagues. The Guardian has learned from senior Met officers that they are \"not happy\" with the current supergrass system relied on by CIB3. The home secretary, Jack Straw, has refused a request by the Labour MP Andrew Mackinlay to launch an independent judicial inquiry into the conduct of CIB3 after a Guardian investigation last month. It revealed that CIB3 officers were using discredited practices, including the supergrass system. CIB3 is now the subject of three internal inquiries following the collapse of four high profile trials against serving and former Met detectives. The cleared officers are not satisfied by the existing complaints procedure and point to double standards and score-settling at the heart of CIB3. Mr Straw told Mr Mackinlay he is awaiting the outcome of a review of the police complaints procedure undertaken by international auditors and consultants KPMG in response to the Stephen Lawrence inquiry.",

      "bodyText": "The celebrity chef Marco Pierre White was awarded \u00a375,000 in libel damages in the high court yesterday over a press allegation that he had a bout with drink and drugs. Mr White, 38, who is to marry his long time partner, Mati, tomorrow, was in court with her as the jury announced their verdict in London. They found that Mr White had been defamed in an article published in the New York Times and the International Herald Tribune in May 1998. He had sued over a \"bombshell\" sentence in the syndicated article alleging that he had had a \"well-publicised bout with drink and drugs\". Mr White had told the court that he was angered and upset by the claim. He \"very rarely\" drank, having only a glass of wine \"from time to time\" on a social occasion. \"I have never taken drugs in my life,\" he said. \"I think it's very destructive.\" The court heard that the newspapers now accepted that there was no truth in the allegation. But they argued that the article had not defamed Mr White as it had not lowered his reputation as a chef or a businessman. The jury awarded him \u00a315,000 against the New York Times and \u00a360,000 against the International Herald Tribune. Mr Justice Morland ordered the newspapers to pay the entire costs of the action - on a punitive indemnity basis - estimated at \u00a3480,000. Mr White's counsel, George Carman QC, had told the jury that the chef was the youngest person to obtain three Michelin stars, and the \"only Englishman to be so honoured\".",

      "body": "<p><strong> Coronation Street</strong> (Granada) is like Tombstone these days, with customers being flung out of the Rover's Return and their hats after them. </p> <p>Natalie, the landlady, miffed at her husband and son being murdered in swift succession, is knocking back brandy in the back room and biting the heads off anyone who says they are there for her. (\"Has everyone been telling you they are there for you?\" the barmaid at The Woolpack asked a bereaved boozer in Emmerdale this week.) When did people start being there for you? At the back of my grandmother's handwritten recipe book there is a selection of letters of condolence suitable for any fatality, however bizarre. They all say that perhaps in the Great Beyond we shall understand. None of them say they're there for you. </p> <p>Calling the customers, as Natalie does, \"A bunch of two-faced hypocrites!\" is not the optimum attitude for a licensed victualler, who hopes to maximise profits. <strong> Dangerous Company</strong> (BBC 2) touched on this. Jerry Walton ran 3,000 off-licences. Less when he had shut down 300 of them. How to boost the boozing? As this engagingly frank man put it \"To be honest, we hadn't a bloody clue what to do.\" </p> <p>What he did was call in Deborah, a consultant who specializes in making staff happy using, it says here, \"techniques learned from, celebrity hypnotist, Paul McKenna\". (Look, am I hallucinating or was that a big, blue, inflatable duck in Deborah's office?) She found Jerry's staff lacklustre and proceeded to buff them up to an almost unbearable brilliance. </p> <p>The can-do course involved a lot of bonding. Bottoms Up hugged Victoria Wine. The prettier the employee, the longer they were likely to be hugged. There were encouraging lists. \"Winston Churchill, Charles Darwin, WB Yeats, Hans Christian Andersen, Leonardo da Vinci. These were all people who were classed as failures!\" </p> <p>(It is true that Yeats failed to get the Chair of English he applied for at Trinity College, Dublin. Possibly because he spelled it Proffessership.) </p> <p>The staff took to this like big, blue ducks. In no time they were breaking planks with their bare hands and making a blob of bluetack on a string swing by the power of the mind alone. The effect was almost evangelical. As Walton said \"You come out of it very 'Hey! I can do this!'\" Sad that he was sacked. </p> <p>In their next series Dangerous Company can tackle the recent changes at the BBC. Can't they? </p> <p>I took against <strong> You've Been Trained</strong> (Modern Times, BBC 2) quite quickly. The nudge-nudge commentary (\"Half of British adults spend less than an hour a week doing it. Twenty per cent never do it at all\") was punctuated with orgasmic groaning. </p> <p>\"It\" was exercise. Jonathan, Jessica and Tracey all acquired personal trainers. The relationship is not, in fact, unlike a love affair, tending to go through a bumpy bit in the middle. Jonathan, piqued at his trainer's perceived neglect, told him that, if he were a girlfriend, It Would Be All Over. </p> <p>It was Tracey's relationship with The Major which proved most successful. The Major was a sinewy ex-army PT instructor. Where he wasn't creviced, he was taut. His course involved a great deal of shouting, sprinting, squatting and doing really odd things with balls, like putting your head on them and rotating. </p> <p>Tracey took against all this in spades and retired to bed feeling frail. She said \"I'm very apprehensive about carrying on. I don't like being shouted at At All. It really, really annoyed me. If I'd wanted to be in the army, I'd have joined the army.\" The Major said she was a bit of a wimp. </p> <p>With great reluctance she went on his outward bound course in Wales. Welsh hills, one could not but notice, are all bones. Not an once of superfluous fat on one of them. On the mountain it all seemed to come together for Tracey like a revelation. Exhilarated she rang her mother from the peak. \"I'm really chuffed! I feel wonderful! Amazing!\" Or as Cagney put it ,\"Top of the world, ma!\" </p> <p>For \u00a3260 Tracey stood under a Welsh waterfall smiling in a mist of deliciousness. Jonathan spent nearly \u00a31,000, lost four centimetres off his bottom and took to riding a bicycle with a baseball cap back to front. Jessica spent \u00a3700, found drinking was a barrier to fitness and gave up fitness.</p>",

(\"Has everyone been telling you they are there for you?\" the barmaid at The Woolpack asked a bereaved boozer in Emmerdale this week.) When did people start being there for you? At the back of my grandmother's handwritten recipe book there is a selection of letters of condolence suitable for any fatality, however bizarre. They all say that perhaps in the Great Beyond we shall understand. None of them say they're there for you. Calling the customers, as Natalie does, \"A bunch of two-faced hypocrites!\" is not the optimum attitude for a licensed victualler, who hopes to maximise profits. Dangerous Company (BBC 2) touched on this. Jerry Walton ran 3,000 off-licences. Less when he had shut down 300 of them. How to boost the boozing? As this engagingly frank man put it \"To be honest, we hadn't a bloody clue what to do.\" What he did was call in Deborah, a consultant who specializes in making staff happy using, it says here, \"techniques learned from, celebrity hypnotist, Paul McKenna\". (Look, am I hallucinating or was that a big, blue, inflatable duck in Deborah's office?) She found Jerry's staff lacklustre and proceeded to buff them up to an almost unbearable brilliance. The can-do course involved a lot of bonding. Bottoms Up hugged Victoria Wine. The prettier the employee, the longer they were likely to be hugged. There were encouraging lists. \"Winston Churchill, Charles Darwin, WB Yeats, Hans Christian Andersen, Leonardo da Vinci. These were all people who were classed as failures!\" (It is true that Yeats failed to get the Chair of English he applied for at Trinity College, Dublin. Possibly because he spelled it Proffessership.) The staff took to this like big, blue ducks. In no time they were breaking planks with their bare hands and making a blob of bluetack on a string swing by the power of the mind alone. The effect was almost evangelical. As Walton said \"You come out of it very 'Hey! I can do this!'\" Sad that he was sacked. In their next series Dangerous Company can tackle the recent changes at the BBC. Can't they? I took against You've Been Trained (Modern Times, BBC 2) quite quickly. The nudge-nudge commentary (\"Half of British adults spend less than an hour a week doing it. Twenty per cent never do it at all\") was punctuated with orgasmic groaning. \"It\" was exercise. Jonathan, Jessica and Tracey all acquired personal trainers. The relationship is not, in fact, unlike a love affair, tending to go through a bumpy bit in the middle. Jonathan, piqued at his trainer's perceived neglect, told him that, if he were a girlfriend, It Would Be All Over. It was Tracey's relationship with The Major which proved most successful. The Major was a sinewy ex-army PT instructor. Where he wasn't creviced, he was taut. His course involved a great deal of shouting, sprinting, squatting and doing really odd things with balls, like putting your head on them and rotating. Tracey took against all this in spades and retired to bed feeling frail. She said \"I'm very apprehensive about carrying on. I don't like being shouted at At All. It really, really annoyed me. If I'd wanted to be in the army, I'd have joined the army.\" The Major said she was a bit of a wimp. With great reluctance she went on his outward bound course in Wales. Welsh hills, one could not but notice, are all bones. Not an once of superfluous fat on one of them. On the mountain it all seemed to come together for Tracey like a revelation. Exhilarated she rang her mother from the peak. \"I'm really chuffed! I feel wonderful! Amazing!\" Or as Cagney put it ,\"Top of the world, ma!\" For \u00a3260 Tracey stood under a Welsh waterfall smiling in a mist of deliciousness. Jonathan spent nearly \u00a31,000, lost four centimetres off his bottom and took to riding a bicycle with a baseball cap back to front. Jessica spent \u00a3700, found drinking was a barrier to fitness and gave up fitness.",

      "body": "<p>I 'm going out with the graduating class of 2000\", said Bill Cosby last week, announcing the canning of The Cosby Show. \"I wish I could have done better for CBS.\" It's a downbeat signing-off for America's No 1 dad, Dr Cliff Huxtable, part of the troika of highest paid black entertainers in America: Oprah, Michael Jackson, and Bill. </p> <p>Cosby joined CBS in 1995, three years after leaving NBC, home of The Cosby Show for the whole of the 1980s - the decade Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates called \"The Cosby Decade\" for the simple reason that The Cosby Show rearranged the landscape. American TV had seen nothing like it. </p> <p>At least, not since I Love Lucy, a show to which Cosby was hugely indebted. At its inception, however, Cosby sought to create the opposite. \"(I wish to show) African-Americans acting like human beings - I want people to look at this show and say, 'Hey, how did they get cameras in my house?'\" </p> <p>But Cosby did nothing of the sort. Instead, he created an ultra-smooth, ultra-aspirational portrait of the perfect American family. The banter between Cosby and his family was pure Lucy, with Cosby playing the role Lucille Ball had forged: kooky, loving, the linchpin of the family; continually reined in by his partner - ie, told off for stashing the cookies - but ultimately at the centre of, and totally in control of his middle-class world. </p> <p>The popularity of the show in the 1980s coincided with a moment in black America analogous to the height of I Love Lucy in the 60s. Both came just before a bubble burst. For apple-pie white America, it was Vietnam and civil rights. For the emergent black middle-class aspiring to Cosby prosperity in the 80s, it was the rebirth of race politics via the LA riots, Marion Barry's Washington crack revelations and the end of colour-blind social aspiration. </p> <p>In the 90s, America reconfigured itself. Denzel Washington could play Malcolm X in a slick Hollywood blockbuster and Tarantino could call everyone \"nigga\". Both were cool. Cosby mugging to camera wasn't. </p> <p>At the end of the decade, the uneasy stand-off between Cosby, The Man and Dr Cliff Huxtable came to an end with the death of his 28-year-old son, Ennis, in a drive-by shooting. Ennis had overcome dyslexia to gain a doctorate from Columbia University, and was planning to set up a school for children with learning difficulties. His upbringing bore an uncanny resemblance to Theo Huxtable's in the Cosby Show; his real-life success, a self-fulfilling prophecy borne of the fictional son. </p> <p>Here was the real end of the Cosby Show, not last week's downbeat announcement. TV sitcom had crossed American gun law, with the most depressing conclusion imaginable. Cosby couldn't sustain the charade any more. His heart wasn't in it. </p> <p>To condemn the series as glossy make-believe is to seriously misunderstand the significance of The Cosby Show. By 1992, the show had won six Emmys and 14 Image awards from the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People. Cosby had fought numerous battles with the network, including threatening to take the show off air when NBC objected to an anti-apartheid poster in one of the bedrooms. </p> <p>Accusing Cosby of political cop-out was a favourite game of predominantly white liberal journalists in the 90s. A more accurate reading of his stance would be to acknowledge that Cosby played the very long game. Unlike Michael Ovitz or Jerry Katzenberg, Cosby (and Oprah) reached a level of unparalleled power within the American entertainment industry after decades of hard slog at the coalface of commercial TV. </p> <p>They moved into the boardroom only after becoming stars. Here is where the real focus of institutional racism in the American entertainment industry lies. Neither could have attained power-broker status without a supreme ability to play a frustrating balancing act throughout their long on-screen careers. </p> <p>For Cosby, this may have explained his refusal to accommodate change within the show. Cosby did nothing to upset the cart. Ultimately, the man was looking to become a real role model, rather than a fictional one. And the pay-off for off-screen power was always going to be on-screen compromise. </p> <p>Compare the rise of Cosby in the 80s with the rise of Roseanne. A sit-com that, in many ways, fulfilled Cosby's original aim to show a mirror to the audience, warts and all. </p> <p>Roseanne was ostensibly far more radical than The Cosby Show, hitting the network where it hurt by portraying the most advertiser-unfriendly family in the history of American sitcom (attitudes soon changed when the show was pulling in audiences of more than 15 million). Like Cosby, Roseanne found it increasingly difficult to sustain the blur between character and reality. And for all Roseanne's claims to blue-collar credibility, race (and racism) was as conspicuously absent as it was in Cosby. </p> <p>Perhaps history will read the two shows as companion pieces. Roseanne may have struck a chord with ordinary white (and a surprisingly large proportion of black) families, but Cosby represented some platonic ideal of assimilation. And in America, there is no higher thing to aspire to than a patent lie.</p>",

American TV had seen nothing like it. At least, not since I Love Lucy, a show to which Cosby was hugely indebted. At its inception, however, Cosby sought to create the opposite. \"(I wish to show) African-Americans acting like human beings - I want people to look at this show and say, 'Hey, how did they get cameras in my house?'\" But Cosby did nothing of the sort. Instead, he created an ultra-smooth, ultra-aspirational portrait of the perfect American family. The banter between Cosby and his family was pure Lucy, with Cosby playing the role Lucille Ball had forged: kooky, loving, the linchpin of the family; continually reined in by his partner - ie, told off for stashing the cookies - but ultimately at the centre of, and totally in control of his middle-class world. The popularity of the show in the 1980s coincided with a moment in black America analogous to the height of I Love Lucy in the 60s. Both came just before a bubble burst. For apple-pie white America, it was Vietnam and civil rights. For the emergent black middle-class aspiring to Cosby prosperity in the 80s, it was the rebirth of race politics via the LA riots, Marion Barry's Washington crack revelations and the end of colour-blind social aspiration. In the 90s, America reconfigured itself. Denzel Washington could play Malcolm X in a slick Hollywood blockbuster and Tarantino could call everyone \"nigga\". Both were cool. Cosby mugging to camera wasn't. At the end of the decade, the uneasy stand-off between Cosby, The Man and Dr Cliff Huxtable came to an end with the death of his 28-year-old son, Ennis, in a drive-by shooting. Ennis had overcome dyslexia to gain a doctorate from Columbia University, and was planning to set up a school for children with learning difficulties. His upbringing bore an uncanny resemblance to Theo Huxtable's in the Cosby Show; his real-life success, a self-fulfilling prophecy borne of the fictional son. Here was the real end of the Cosby Show, not last week's downbeat announcement. TV sitcom had crossed American gun law, with the most depressing conclusion imaginable. Cosby couldn't sustain the charade any more. His heart wasn't in it. To condemn the series as glossy make-believe is to seriously misunderstand the significance of The Cosby Show. By 1992, the show had won six Emmys and 14 Image awards from the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People. Cosby had fought numerous battles with the network, including threatening to take the show off air when NBC objected to an anti-apartheid poster in one of the bedrooms. Accusing Cosby of political cop-out was a favourite game of predominantly white liberal journalists in the 90s. A more accurate reading of his stance would be to acknowledge that Cosby played the very long game. Unlike Michael Ovitz or Jerry Katzenberg, Cosby (and Oprah) reached a level of unparalleled power within the American entertainment industry after decades of hard slog at the coalface of commercial TV. They moved into the boardroom only after becoming stars. Here is where the real focus of institutional racism in the American entertainment industry lies. Neither could have attained power-broker status without a supreme ability to play a frustrating balancing act throughout their long on-screen careers. For Cosby, this may have explained his refusal to accommodate change within the show. Cosby did nothing to upset the cart. Ultimately, the man was looking to become a real role model, rather than a fictional one. And the pay-off for off-screen power was always going to be on-screen compromise. Compare the rise of Cosby in the 80s with the rise of Roseanne. A sit-com that, in many ways, fulfilled Cosby's original aim to show a mirror to the audience, warts and all. Roseanne was ostensibly far more radical than The Cosby Show, hitting the network where it hurt by portraying the most advertiser-unfriendly family in the history of American sitcom (attitudes soon changed when the show was pulling in audiences of more than 15 million). Like Cosby, Roseanne found it increasingly difficult to sustain the blur between character and reality. And for all Roseanne's claims to blue-collar credibility, race (and racism) was as conspicuously absent as it was in Cosby. Perhaps history will read the two shows as companion pieces. Roseanne may have struck a chord with ordinary white (and a surprisingly large proportion of black) families, but Cosby represented some platonic ideal of assimilation. And in America, there is no higher thing to aspire to than a patent lie.",

Mozart's friends were required to attend the funeral, sing hymns at the graveside and listen to a recitation of a poem Mozart had written to honour the occasion. Eight days later, Mozart composed his divertimento, or sextet for strings and two horns, which ornithologists believe was an attempt to mimic the way his starling sang. </p> <p>Dr Luis Baptista, an ornithologist from the California Academy of Sciences, San Francisco, claims that song birds compose music and that Mozart was not alone - bird song has influenced human musicians for centuries. In many pieces of western music, bird song inspires the composer but the birds themselves are not recognisable. Mozart's K220 mass has a violin chirping like a bird, hence it's nickname \"Spatzen Mass\" (Sparrow Mass), but the music doesn't actually sound like a sparrow. Other compositions include bird songs that are recognisable: Beethoven, Schubert and Haydn all imitated the call of the quail; even today some European blackbirds sing the opening phrases to the rondo of Beethoven's violin concerto, suggesting that 200 years ago the composer might have been inspired by a blackbird. </p> <p>Bird song, for all its ability to launch a thousand odes by human poets, is designed to attract mates or ward off rivals. In non-song birds, the calls are genetically inherited. Song birds have more complex songs that have some genetic component (all birds can sing in perfect pitch, for instance) but there is more fluidity about the structure and composition of their songs. \"Birds often use the same rhythmic variations, pitch relationships, permutations and combinations of notes as found in music, and they often vary themes in much the same way as humans,\" says Baptista. The canyon wren sings in the chromatic scale, while the hermit thrush employs the pentatonic. </p> <p>Birds use some of the same musical effects in their songs as composers: the crescendo, a gradual increase in volume, is found in the songs of Heuglin's robin chat, and the diminuendo is heard in Swainson's thrush. Savannah sparrows begin their song with a series of pulsed notes of short duration at a sustained pitch; Beethoven used this technique in the introductions of his violin concerto in D (opus 61). </p> <p>Like musical composers who want to keep the audience entertained with novelty and variety, yet retain familiar elements to prevent psychological fatigue, birds produce a number of musical themes and variations on themes. One European skylark was observed to sing for 58 minutes without pausing (they have specially built lungs to allow them to perform such feats). The appropriately named musician wren sings a theme, a variation on the theme, then returns to the original melody - Bach did the same in the Goldberg Variations. </p> <p>According to Baptista, there are three ways in which musical traditions are passed on in both birds and humans. One mode is the vertical tradition, where songs are passed from one generation to the next, just as genes for musical ability are also inherited. In New Guinea, songs are so valuable that they are paid for with pigs and a good song is more expensive than a bride. On the island of Karker, Baptista sat up night after night as the chieftain rehearsed a song with his son Dalos. The oldest son would inherit his land, but Dalos could have his song. In the 1950s, it was shown that this kind of traditional learning occurs in some birds, too. </p> <p>An ornithologist raised a bullfinch with a canary. The finch sang the canary's song, and when he bred, his son learnt the canary song and ignored the song of their own species. In Baden-W\u00fcrtenberg, in Germany, villagers used to raise bullfinches and teach them folk tunes. The last bullfinch teacher died in the 1970s, but three recordings of a bullfinch singing a German folk song live on. </p> <p> T he second way of passing on songs is the oblique tradition in which unrelated adults teach songs to the younger generation: Haydn taught Beethoven, Vivaldi tutored orphans in the Piet\u00e0. This is the most widespread type of learning in birds: Bewick's wrens and indigo buntings, for instance, learn the songs adults sing. Finally, in the horizontal tradition, one learns from one's peers - nursery songs from other children, for example. Anna's hummingbirds will learn very similar songs if raised together. </p> <p>\"Birds do compose and vary songs on a theme,\" says Dr John Hutchinson of Bristol university's zoology department. Hutchinson, who studies skylarks, adds: \"Even when they sing the same song, they alter it a bit, which is a human technique. Birds also borrow from sounds they've heard.\" White-crowned sparrows and song sparrows with adjacent territories sometimes sing each other's songs when they are competing over their territory. Many birds are good mimics - Lawrence's thrush of South America imitates 173 bird species plus frogs and insects. Female song birds prefer males who have the most complex and novel songs - hence the reason why starlings, who are also good mimics, sometimes whistle like trains or shepherds. </p> <p>Baptista is not alone in claiming that Mozart was perhaps mimicking his pet starling's natural capacity to intertwine tunes and sing them off-key. There is also another curious aspect of the Divertimento. We make sounds with our vocal cords in the larynx; song birds have two organs known as the syrinx with which they can produce the same sound in both organs, or two separate sounds simultaneously. Baptista says, \"the final cadence in [Divertimento] is written in two separate keys played simultaneously: was Mozart simulating his starling singing in two voices?\" Whether he was or not, it is perhaps fortunate for us that Mozart grew attached to a starling and not a crow.</p>",

Anna's hummingbirds will learn very similar songs if raised together. \"Birds do compose and vary songs on a theme,\" says Dr John Hutchinson of Bristol university's zoology department. Hutchinson, who studies skylarks, adds: \"Even when they sing the same song, they alter it a bit, which is a human technique. Birds also borrow from sounds they've heard.\" White-crowned sparrows and song sparrows with adjacent territories sometimes sing each other's songs when they are competing over their territory. Many birds are good mimics - Lawrence's thrush of South America imitates 173 bird species plus frogs and insects. Female song birds prefer males who have the most complex and novel songs - hence the reason why starlings, who are also good mimics, sometimes whistle like trains or shepherds. Baptista is not alone in claiming that Mozart was perhaps mimicking his pet starling's natural capacity to intertwine tunes and sing them off-key. There is also another curious aspect of the Divertimento. We make sounds with our vocal cords in the larynx; song birds have two organs known as the syrinx with which they can produce the same sound in both organs, or two separate sounds simultaneously. Baptista says, \"the final cadence in [Divertimento] is written in two separate keys played simultaneously: was Mozart simulating his starling singing in two voices?\" Whether he was or not, it is perhaps fortunate for us that Mozart grew attached to a starling and not a crow.",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair has finally agreed to campaign for Frank Dobson as London mayor, after a private meeting between the two. The prime minister is now expected to attend a rally with Mr Dobson this week or next, and backing is also likely from his deputy, John Prescott, and the chancellor, Gordon Brown. Mr Dobson has been pressing for weeks for active support from Mr Blair, but Downing Street, assuming that Ken Livingstone will win, has seemed reluctant to see the prime minister lose credibility by pulling out all the stops for Labour's damaged mayoral candidate. Labour insiders say their polling shows Mr Dobson doing well among ethnic minorities and older voters but trailing badly among young voters and the politically unattached. Mr Livingstone yesterday told the Commons transport committee that if the government pressed ahead with its part privatisation scheme for the London tube he would \"crawl all over them all the time. You don't make a patsy out of me if I'm mayor.\" Mr Dobson accused Mr Livingstone of a u-turn when he told the committee that \"you would be a fool to ignore it\" if the government's plans were demonstrated to be cheaper than his bond-finance public sector scheme. The Greater London returning officer's list published yesterday shows more than 200 candidates for the mayoral and assembly elections on May 4. With Mr Livingstone, Mr Dobson, the Tories' Steve Norris, the Liberal Democrat Susan Kramer and the Greens' Darren Johnson, six others are standing for mayor. Eighty-four candidates are contesting the 14 first-past-the-post assembly seats, and 139 are standing on 14 party lists for the 11 proportional top-up seats. Some are fighting both, and one list has only one candidate, the gay rights activist Peter Tatchell, an independent. Six lists, including Mr Tatchell's, are to the left of Labour: the Greens, the London Socialist Alliance, headed by the journalist Paul Foot, the Socialist Labour party, led by the miners' leader Arthur Scargill, the Communist party and the Campaign Against Rail Privatisation. The candidates' list shows keen competition for the anti-tube privatisation and pro-Ken Livingstone mantles among independents, and all Liberal Democrats, including Ms Kramer, are standing as Liberal Democrats Against Tube Sell-off.

      "bodyText": "Cabinet ministers need a freedom of information act as much as backbenchers because they too are kept in the dark by civil servants, the veteran ex-cabinet minister, Tony Benn warned last night. As MPs from all sides harried the home secretary, Jack Straw, over the need to improve what they called his \"disappointing\" freedom of information bill, Mr Benn - who served 11 years in cabinet under James Callaghan and Harold Wilson - told younger colleagues there were few real secrets in government. As minister in charge of nuclear power he had been denied important facts including details of the 1957 fire at Windscale (now Sellafield) nuclear plant or the fact that British \"atoms for peace\" plutonium had been exported to make US bombs. Congratulating those behind the campaign for freedom of information he predicted: \"I see this as the beginnings of a recovery of power by the legislature in dealing with the executive.\" The Chesterfield MP, 75 this week, went on to argue that, if the public is allowed information on important decisions it allows ministers to act as umpires between the advice of their civil servants and outside opinion - instead of being prisoners of Whitehall. As MPs prepared to debate late into the night on the detailed report stage of Mr Straw's bill - three days after 41 Labour members rebelled on pensions - the home secretary has already given ground. Only ministers of cabinet rank will be able to exercise \"executive over-ride\" on proposals by the information commissioner that specific material be published. The move pleased some critics. But yesterday Labour's Tony Wright (Cannock), chairman of the public administration committee, moved a series of cross-party amendments, itemising \"four barricades\" which the bill errected against disclosure in the vital policy information area. Mr Wright said factual information underlying policy decisions would be exempt under the bill and called for this to be deleted altogether. \"Nobody pretends for a second that there is not an area of government which needs to be protected. But what we insist on is that we make some necessary distinctions,\" he said. Colleagues, including former Tory minister, David Davis (Boothferry) insisted that New Zealand, Ireland, Canada and other states with similar political cultures had managed to distinguish between policy advice and the facts underpinning it. Mr Straw insisted there was a \"genuine difficulty\" of definition and said that the facts were usually published eventually. A minister seeking to cover up \"scandalous conduct\" would be unwise to use executive over-ride for that purpose. His own amendments sought to strengthen the bill, said Mr Straw, who argued that the Labour government has always acted in good faith on freedom of information and not given answers which were \"literal and unhelpful\" as the Tories did in office. Liberal Democrat, David Heath (Somerton and Frome) praised the government for bringing the bill forward but said: \"If you are not prepared to be tough the ministries, tough on the civil servants, tough on secrecy and tough on the causes of secrecy, then the bill will have failed.\" Labour's Gordon Prentice (Pendle) said: \"A lot of information that should be fully available is withheld, not just from members of the public, but members of parliament to avoid embarrassment.\" Mr Benn warned that ministers often confused the public interest with their own.

Josh Hannah, Vince Monical and Mark Peters are not trying to sell anything, but they plan to make pots of money from lots of punters placing small bets against each other on their site. </p> <p>Flutter.com will not be for hardcore gamblers. There is a limit of \u00a3100, bets are likely to be around \u00a35 and \u00a310, and can be made only between two people. Flutter.com is keen to emphasise that it is not in the online gaming business, an area occupied by the likes of Littlewoods, Freeserve and Sports Internet. This American trio offers something else - the fun and games of individuals betting against each other. The idea came from Mr Hannah and Mr Monical who used to bet with each other, when they worked as consultants at Bain &amp; Company, one of the world's leading consultancies. </p> <p>\"When we worked together in Silicon Valley, we'd love to bet with each other. It was very personal, I'd wind Josh up, and end up taking a lot of his money. Then we'd make bets by email and from there it was a natural jump to the internet,\" said Monical. Scheduled for a late April launch, Flutter.com seeks to recreate that spirit of dare and spontaneity, spiced with a financial frisson, but on a scale only the internet can make possible. </p> <p>Two friends or acquaintances can make a bet in the office or in the pub. Flutter.com takes that idea further. You can go to the site, pick a field of your choice, say football, and place a bet on who will win a game, how many goals will be scored and so on. Participants are encouraged to banter, engage in one-upmanship and put their money where their mouth is. Politics, pop music, movies are some of the areas in which people can take on each other in bets that have already been set up on the site by Flutter.com's editorial team. Eventually people will be able to post their own bets. </p> <p>\"We want to create areas that people feel passionate about, get a discussion going between Arsenal fans and Chelsea fans with their vast amount of knowledge,\" said Hannah in the company's Clerkenwell office. \"The limit on the size of the bets is to keep the focus on entertainment. It's a lot more fun taking money off a person while engaging in social chit chat.\" </p> <p>Flutter.com is not a sweepstakes site, where people put money into a pot and stand to win the lot. It aims to attract casual punters - the flutterers in pubs and offices and the 34% of the population who bet once a year on a few key national events, such as the Grand National. This is the company's target audience rather than the 3% of the population who bet regularly at a bookmaker. Ironically, Flutter.com is next door to a William Hill betting shop. </p> <p>\"We are the first company of its kind. There are no others attacking this space,\" said Hannah. \"This is something very new in entertainment, we are creating a virtual marketplace.\" </p> <p>Britain was the ideal location for Flutter.com although it meant leaving the charms of San Francisco. The US posed too many regulatory hurdles with each state having its own gaming laws and some states prohibiting gambling altogether, even on Flutter.com's modest scale. The UK, Mr Hannah said, had the best regulatory framework and was far ahead of America in its rules and regulations. </p> <p>Flutter.com was not worried about the high internet access costs because it was clear that these would fall - and companies such as AltaVista, BT and NTL have been rushing out offers of unlimited access for a modest upfront fee. </p> <p>The company will make money by taking 5% from each bet, 2.5% from either end. The site holds the money and makes sure it ends up with the winning party, acting like the bartender who is entrusted with the money. The model for Flutter.com is eBay, the auction site that makes money from thousands of transactions between buyers and sellers on no items too inexpensive and culling a small percentage from each one. </p> <p>Flutter.com has won the endorsement of investors such as Bernard Arnault, the French head of LVMH, the world's biggest luxury goods empire. Last October, his Europ@web venture fund invested $5.2m in Flutter.com in the first round of financing and the second round is already oversubscribed. </p> <p>\"This is probably one of the most compelling opportunities we've come across,\" says Alex Nigg, of Europ@web. \"It is truly innovative, unlike so many me-too plays on the net. It fundamentally changes betting. People are not betting against an institution like Ladbrokes or William Hill, but against each other, Flutter.com restores social activity and entertainment to wagers.\" </p> <p>Nick Denton, co-founder of the First Tuesday networking group, believes Flutter.com will make Lastminute.com, Britain's most high-profile net startup, look like \"a first generation venture\". Mr Denton particularly likes the fact that Flutter.com in effect sits on a stash of cash by holding people's bets. There is a certain elegant simplicity about the concept behind Flutter.com and one of its biggest advantages is that it avoids the overcrowded net retail sector, where profit margins are razor-thin as everybody is trying to sell something cheaper than anyone else. </p> <p>Hannah and Monical have grand designs for Flutter.com. \"We have a shot at being one of the cornerstones of the new internet economy of the UK,\" said Hannah. \"Over time, we will take it international and expand into other products.\" </p> <p>But these high ambitions will be realised only if Flutter. com wins its bet that Britain's punters will flock to the site.</p>",

The model for Flutter.com is eBay, the auction site that makes money from thousands of transactions between buyers and sellers on no items too inexpensive and culling a small percentage from each one. Flutter.com has won the endorsement of investors such as Bernard Arnault, the French head of LVMH, the world's biggest luxury goods empire. Last October, his Europ@web venture fund invested $5.2m in Flutter.com in the first round of financing and the second round is already oversubscribed. \"This is probably one of the most compelling opportunities we've come across,\" says Alex Nigg, of Europ@web. \"It is truly innovative, unlike so many me-too plays on the net. It fundamentally changes betting. People are not betting against an institution like Ladbrokes or William Hill, but against each other, Flutter.com restores social activity and entertainment to wagers.\" Nick Denton, co-founder of the First Tuesday networking group, believes Flutter.com will make Lastminute.com, Britain's most high-profile net startup, look like \"a first generation venture\". Mr Denton particularly likes the fact that Flutter.com in effect sits on a stash of cash by holding people's bets. There is a certain elegant simplicity about the concept behind Flutter.com and one of its biggest advantages is that it avoids the overcrowded net retail sector, where profit margins are razor-thin as everybody is trying to sell something cheaper than anyone else. Hannah and Monical have grand designs for Flutter.com. \"We have a shot at being one of the cornerstones of the new internet economy of the UK,\" said Hannah. \"Over time, we will take it international and expand into other products.\" But these high ambitions will be realised only if Flutter. com wins its bet that Britain's punters will flock to the site.",

Proprietary email services usually come with the software you need to use them. </p> <p>Post Office Protocol 3 is the standard on the internet, and almost every internet service provider (ISP) provides POP3-compatible mailboxes. You can collect and read POP3 mail with many different mail programs, such as Eudora and Pine (Program for Internet News &amp; Email). Today, the most obvious choice is Microsoft's Outlook Express 5, because it works, it's free, and unlike some rivals, can collect email from several different POP3 accounts. </p> <p>I mainly use Ameol (A Most Excellent Off-Line mail reader).

But it is slow and if you're typing email while online (logged on to the web site) it could also be very expensive. </p> <p>However, Outlook Express can now collect mail from Hotmail too. On version 5, go to Tools on the taskbar, and under New accounts, you will find the option to set up a new Hotmail account. Following the instructions will open an account that you can use on the web or which will open automatically whenever you collect your mail from your own internet service provider. </p> <p>Borrow the settings for this to set up a collection service for your existing Hotmail account. Outlook Express can also be used to collect email from some other web-based services, too - or at least from Yahoo! - but only if they are served up as POP3 mail. </p> <p> Setting up a POP3 mailbox is not hard, but you have to know the addresses for incoming (POP) and outgoing (SMTP or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) mail. Usually these are pop.mail.yahoo.com and smtp.mail.yahoo.com or something equally obvious: it's often quicker to guess than to look them up. </p> <p>But you aren't limited to one service. I have so many email addresses that I've lost track, but I'm a regular user of AOL, BT Internet, Cix, CompuServe, Freeserve, Hotmail, Yahoo, and the Guardian's email system. They all have different uses. For example, I almost always give a Hotmail address online, so that gets the most \"spam\" or junk mail. </p> <p>The spam is, with luck, automatically diverted into Hotmail's \"bulk mail\" folder where it can be deleted without being downloaded, read or even looked at. </p> <p>I also use a Hotmail address to receive email attachments (which I hate) while a Yahoo address collects messages from web search services such as <a href=\"http://www.spyonit.com\">SpyOnIt</a>. You could set up a box to receive newsletters, letters from mailing lists, or any other mail you don't want clogging up your serious mail service. </p> <p>It's not a problem when email ends up in the wrong box: you can forward it to the right one. Sometimes you can even get a rules-based software robot or \"agent\" to do it automatically, which is how I handle email sent to the Guardian. </p> <p>When you've got multiple mailboxes at different locations, accept you're an email junkie and buy a notebook computer to collect email wherever there's a phone socket, and deal with a lot of it on buses, trains and planes. </p> <p>Just make sure your ISP isn't going to claim your mailbox is \"full\" and start bouncing (rejecting) messages after 10 or 20 megabytes, or you'll have to take your notebook on holiday as well...</p>",

You could set up a box to receive newsletters, letters from mailing lists, or any other mail you don't want clogging up your serious mail service. It's not a problem when email ends up in the wrong box: you can forward it to the right one. Sometimes you can even get a rules-based software robot or \"agent\" to do it automatically, which is how I handle email sent to the Guardian. When you've got multiple mailboxes at different locations, accept you're an email junkie and buy a notebook computer to collect email wherever there's a phone socket, and deal with a lot of it on buses, trains and planes. Just make sure your ISP isn't going to claim your mailbox is \"full\" and start bouncing (rejecting) messages after 10 or 20 megabytes, or you'll have to take your notebook on holiday as well...",

      "body": "<p> At the stroke of midnight on Wednesday, March 29, a potential revolution started. From that moment you could download, free, a new way not only of surfing the internet, but also news, emails and all your documents at the same time. This is <a href=\"http://www.kenjin.com/\" target=\"_new\">Kenjin</a>.</p> <p> The new tool comes from Autonomy, the Cambridge based internet company headed by the UK's first internet billionaire. CEO Mike Lynch may have been keeping his company's profile low since the days he borrowed \u00a32,000 from a pop promoter in a pub to start it, but the release of Kenjin will change that. </p> <p> Named after the Japanese for wise man, it uses a version of Autonomy's powerful technology, previously available only to big businesses, to \"understand\" what you write. It then puts a variety of related resources at your fingertips. So does this spell the death of the search engine? This is the Online road test. </p> <p>The journey begins at <a href=\"http://www.kenjin.com/\" target=\"_new\">www.kenjin.com</a>. After the download link you find your way through several web pages asking various technical questions. The final link begins the actual downloading process. That takes a pleasant one half to four minutes. As long as you have a PC (it doesn't work on Macs at the moment), or a firewall, it should be painless. The download process leaves an icon on the desktop. Activating this brings up the installation wizard which leads you logically through the set-up process, step by step. Consecutive screens ask you for registration information and destinations to place files. </p> <p>More importantly, if you wish to use the Kenjin to search your hard drive, you must activate the personal Kenjin box. The actual act of installation takes as little as 10 seconds. Your path to the Kenjin is now finished and a new world of information seeking has just begun. The Kenjin starts automatically upon installation, and, if you have accurately followed the instructions, what you should see is a grey tool bar sitting across the bottom of your screen. What makes it so remarkable and equally at times frustrating, is its simplicity. </p> <p>To the left are four selection icons that determine what kind of information source the Kenjin is going to search through. If you select the news and world wide web icons, it searches the net for you. The local icon searches your own hard drive and the fourth allows you to search for relevant people's emails. Thankfully, for civil liberties issues, the function to contact others (and them to contact you) is optional and can be switched off. Once installed and activated, the Kenjin works continuously, searching your text - no fumbling with search engines or key words here.</p> <p>To the right of the tool bar are four further icons that initiate the search. So, to make your first step into the world of Kenjin, first open a document as if you were working on it. Make sure your internet connection is up, then pick up the circular wheel-like icon, and simply throw it into your text. The Kenjin now understands everything. </p> <p> Well, this is what Autonomy would have you believe, but further inspection reveals that it merely analyses using pattern recognition algorithms. These word patterns are compared with whatever source you have selected, usually, and most importantly, the net. The results are displayed in the centre of the toolbar. Given a text on cricket, Kenjin didn't find links about insects, but five sporting pages. By comparison, <a href=\"http://www.google.com\" target=\"_new\">www.google.com</a> presented 10 cricket pages, the top two of which were the same. But one advantage of Google remains the ability to go back. Once the Kenjin takes you to a new page, it finds new links. If you then wanted to see another of the originally presented links, the operation has to be performed again and it doesn't always present the same results given the same page. Kenjin also finds relevant books - although it noticeably only found results on Amazon.com. </p> <p> Using the search web news function proved very effective. Given the terms \"Rover Birmingham\", after the recent crisis there, Google found nine out of 10 links relevant to the car manufacturer, but none about news. Kenjin found five Yahoo and BBC news reports. The most difficult and least clear process is installation of the personal Kenjin. Right clicking the tool bar gives the option to go to \"My Computer\"; once there, the relevant directories for personal Kenjin to search must be first selected and then indexed. This process takes more time the more files you have (in my case over 15 minutes). </p> <p>Given key words, Kenjin seemed to find emails in preference to texts on the hard drive. Nonetheless, if properly installed, the Kenjin could mean the end of folders within an inbox. A second icon on the right hand side, a light bulb, glows brightly on occasions. It can be used to find stock prices but when there was a postcode in the text, the bulb (inconsistently) glowed and, once activated, a web page opened. </p> <p>When you use the <a href=\"http://www.multimap.com\" target=\"_new\">multimap.com</a> site, a map will appear, encircling the location to an accuracy of, say, within a few homes. Big brother knows where you live. Other features on the toolbar ensure default screening of adult content and variable thresholds of accuracy of links. These options are accessed via another of the icons to the right. For the confused, there is a useful FAQ page located at the Kenjin homepage. Does Kenjin amount to a revolution in an easy to download format? </p> <p>The answer is probably yes. Not because Kenjin is vastly superior to search engines, although it certainly expands and redefines what can be done with one, but because of what it represents. With attention previously focused on improving simplistic interactive search engine methods, this represents a radical shift in approach to dealing with the sprawling web. Using such powerful underlying technology, and giving it away free, Kenjin might just prove to be the wise man after all.</p>",

If you select the news and world wide web icons, it searches the net for you. The local icon searches your own hard drive and the fourth allows you to search for relevant people's emails. Thankfully, for civil liberties issues, the function to contact others (and them to contact you) is optional and can be switched off. Once installed and activated, the Kenjin works continuously, searching your text - no fumbling with search engines or key words here. To the right of the tool bar are four further icons that initiate the search. So, to make your first step into the world of Kenjin, first open a document as if you were working on it. Make sure your internet connection is up, then pick up the circular wheel-like icon, and simply throw it into your text. The Kenjin now understands everything. Well, this is what Autonomy would have you believe, but further inspection reveals that it merely analyses using pattern recognition algorithms. These word patterns are compared with whatever source you have selected, usually, and most importantly, the net. The results are displayed in the centre of the toolbar. Given a text on cricket, Kenjin didn't find links about insects, but five sporting pages. By comparison, www.google.com presented 10 cricket pages, the top two of which were the same. But one advantage of Google remains the ability to go back. Once the Kenjin takes you to a new page, it finds new links. If you then wanted to see another of the originally presented links, the operation has to be performed again and it doesn't always present the same results given the same page. Kenjin also finds relevant books - although it noticeably only found results on Amazon.com. Using the search web news function proved very effective. Given the terms \"Rover Birmingham\", after the recent crisis there, Google found nine out of 10 links relevant to the car manufacturer, but none about news. Kenjin found five Yahoo and BBC news reports. The most difficult and least clear process is installation of the personal Kenjin. Right clicking the tool bar gives the option to go to \"My Computer\"; once there, the relevant directories for personal Kenjin to search must be first selected and then indexed. This process takes more time the more files you have (in my case over 15 minutes). Given key words, Kenjin seemed to find emails in preference to texts on the hard drive. Nonetheless, if properly installed, the Kenjin could mean the end of folders within an inbox. A second icon on the right hand side, a light bulb, glows brightly on occasions. It can be used to find stock prices but when there was a postcode in the text, the bulb (inconsistently) glowed and, once activated, a web page opened. When you use the multimap.com site, a map will appear, encircling the location to an accuracy of, say, within a few homes. Big brother knows where you live. Other features on the toolbar ensure default screening of adult content and variable thresholds of accuracy of links. These options are accessed via another of the icons to the right. For the confused, there is a useful FAQ page located at the Kenjin homepage. Does Kenjin amount to a revolution in an easy to download format? The answer is probably yes. Not because Kenjin is vastly superior to search engines, although it certainly expands and redefines what can be done with one, but because of what it represents. With attention previously focused on improving simplistic interactive search engine methods, this represents a radical shift in approach to dealing with the sprawling web. Using such powerful underlying technology, and giving it away free, Kenjin might just prove to be the wise man after all.",

In theory, music products are well suited to the net. People don't need to hold them to make a purchase decision. They're easy to send through the post. And it's easy online to give people access to a huge range of products. However, buying music online can be frustrating. I've bought scores of books online and only experienced one minor problem (a slight delay in one book arriving).</p> <p> In contrast, of around five music purchases online I have experienced problems with three. Two orders went missing (presumed stolen) and one order arrived incomplete and had to be cancelled. That kind of thing happens. The real problem is that it's often something of a trial finding what you want to buy. I still find a big record shop easier and quicker. It's not that site search engines don't work properly. It's more that online music retail sites often don't give you enough information about products. </p> <p>For example, last year I tried to buy an Aretha Franklin compilation online. I wanted something that had most of the well-known tracks and I wasn't too bothered about her more recent efforts. The music sites I tried served up scores of Aretha albums, but most of the entries didn't feature either track details or reviews. I gave up and went to a megastore instead. Music retailers often get so involved in live webcasts and band interviews, they don't make sure that track listings are available for all the items they're selling. They often list different versions of the same CD or track, but don't tell you how the versions differ, so you often turn up a list of products, all with the same title, but at different prices, for no apparent reason. </p> <p>They don't tell you about the producers and re-mixers who worked on a particular album (particularly important if you're interested in dance music). They don't let you cross-reference that information so you can find other albums re-mixed or produced by a particular artist. Though many music sites now do give product availability information, often, if you want to buy anything out of the way, you may wait two weeks or more for your purchase to arrive. Judith Catton of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">Amazon UK</a> says that my concerns aren't really reflected by other users (although the net is supposed to be perfect for specialist consumers, it's seems I'm just too specialist). </p> <p>\"Feedback so far is that the store is providing an in-depth place for all music lovers to come and find, discover and buy new music, complete collections and rediscover old favourites,\" she says. In the five months since it entered the music market online, continues Catton, Amazon has become the leading net shop in the area and now boasts more than a million customers. Of course, this may have nothing to do with Amazon's skills at selling music online and may be due to it being able to transfer over some of the huge customer base it has built up via its excellent books site. </p> <p>Certainly, when I've been trying to buy dance compilations on Amazon, I've come across albums with incomplete or incorrect track listings (and detailed and accurate track listings are the crucial piece of purchase information required). \"Track listings come from catalogue information that we are supplied with,\" says Catton. \"We are constantly working on improving this information and are keen to hear where there are mistakes so we can correct them and inform our suppliers.\"</p> <p> \"We do realise that people want more information,\" says Steve Bennett, founder of <a href=\"http://www.jungle.com\" target=\"_new\">Jungle.com</a>. \"But it's taking us a little longer to gather it than you might expect. In the book industry everyone is using the standard ISBN number. That makes it easy. The music industry doesn't have that. To be quite honest, it's crap - it's one of the most disorganised industries I've ever worked with.\" </p> <p> That said, the music business has so much more product. Books have one author, usually, and come in two versions. Music products come in multiple formats, versions and mixes, with lots of guest artists and producers. \"Because of the incredible amount of music out there, there's no single definitive source of information,\" says Rob Markus, vice president of business development at the European music retailer <a href=\"http://www.Boxman\" target=\"_new\">Boxman</a>, who now also controls the big music retailer <a href=\"http://www.Yalplay\" target=\"_new\">Yalplay</a>. \"We're all stuck in the process of building databases, refining them and improving them. </p> <p>No one has got it right yet in Europe. In America, they're closer, but America is a lot easier because you have one language and one set of suppliers. In Europe, you have different products in every country. You might have the same Janet Jackson album in slightly different versions in different European countries. It's something we're working on. But it is a hell of a task.\" Other problems are caused by the way record companies do business. For example, the book trade operates on sale or return. Online booksellers can order in product without risk and have it in their warehouse ready to go out. In contrast, while record companies might have a huge number of products on their back list, they only have a small number available in their warehouses for immediate dispatch. That's why you often have to wait several weeks for non-mainstream orders.</p> <p> Markus says that, in relative terms, the online market for music is still quite small, so it's hard to come to any real conclusions about what people want online and how much information and content they need. Boxman is still trying things out to see what works. \"We're tracking user habits,\" says Markus. \"We've found that people don't use the short sound clips of tracks we provide as much as the industry hype suggested they might.\" People like to see what the CD cover looks like. But the music industry is not that helpful when it comes to supplying images to online music retailers, says Markus. </p> <p> Record companies often don't deliver artwork early enough for online music retailers. \"We'd like music information well in advance of release dates, as with books,\" comments Amazon's Judith Catton.

      "body": "<p> After a series of false starts, which saw several \"net-top boxes\" arrive then disappear again, the armchair internet revolution is finally underway. Instead of spending hundreds of pounds on a PC and struggling with relatively complex software, we are - at long last - being tempted into high street stores to buy infra-red keyboards, net-top boxes and internet TVs for sending email and even surfing the internet from the comfort of our living room sofas. </p> <p> Figures produced by research company Ovum and the UK's leading set-top box manufacturer Pace indicate that the TV will overtake the PC as the most popular means of accessing \"walled-garden\" services (ie selective internet) as well as the world wide web by 2003. By 2005, their research shows, 90 million homes worldwide will use their TV sets for interactive services (including internet access) compared with 60 million homes using the PC. These findings are backed by the Henley Centre, which predicts that digital television will become the dominant channel for online transactions by 2008. Already, e-commerce via television is proving a success. Games retailer Gameplay has dropped the \".com\" from its name because is no longer relevant: it sells more via interactive TV than the web.</p> <p> Of course, cynics might say, we've heard all this before, at least from broadcasters and consumer electronics manufacturers. And they'd be right. Previous attempts to provide internet access via the TV such as NetStation and WebTV (which trialled a service briefly in the UK) have all failed. Poor quality graphics, expensive set-top boxes and high monthly subscription fees have all been cited as reasons for the failure. However, this time there are several reasons why it might be different. The latest generation of \"net-top\" boxes and internet TVs are cheap, don't require a monthly subscription and provide much better quality graphics from internet pages than previous attempts. </p> <p> At the same time, awareness of the internet is higher than ever before and more and more web-sites are being re-designed for the TV set. Now available on the market is a range of internet TVs from the mass-market brand Bush. Included in the line-up are several models - 14 inch, 21 inch and 28 inch screen sizes - with prices starting from just \u00a3200. Once connected to a standard telephone line these can be used by sofa surfers to access virtually all existing internet sites as well as send and receive email free of charge. A large TV remote control that doubles as a Qwerty keyboard is provided to navigate and send email or, alternatively, a full size infra-red keyboard can be bought for around \u00a330. </p> <p> According to Daniel Harris, chief executive of Alba, which owns the Bush brand, the internet TV is designed to appeal to the 85% of homes which don't have internet access via a PC. \"Most people can't be bothered to set up a computer,\" he reckons. \"The internet TV is especially great for kids who love to get mail and email. \"Many TV programmes now have email addresses so the kids can send a message without having to go over to their PC.\" Of course, the internet TV is far from the perfect solution for surfers. Though HTML and Javascript web pages can both be viewed on the TV screen, frames are not supported. Pages are displayed about as quickly as they are on a PC, but quality isn't quite as good. </p> <p>Andy Trott, director of technology and strategic development at Pace - the company that helped develop Bush internet TVs - admits there are limitations as the TV set has a much lower resolution than the PC screen. \"We've managed to minimise problems with new anti-flicker techniques and also taken graphics about as far as they can go on today's TV sets.\" Nevertheless, Mr Trott believes that many of the TV set's limitations will be overcome as content providers adapt for the TV set, just as they are starting to adapt for Wap-enabled mobile phones. For the UK's 3.5 million digital TV homes, interactive services on the TV screen are becoming a reality. </p> <p>Since Open launched its platform on digital satellite last autumn, 550,000 have registered for its free email service with approximately 100,000 homes signing up each month. In the pre-Christmas period, Open estimates that 8 million visits were made to its \"site\" with peak sales exceeding \u00a31m per week. Another company that is also eventually hoping to cash in on the internet via the TV revolution is digital terrestrial broadcaster ONdigital. It has ear-marked \u00a34.5m for an ad spend to promote its ONmail service which launched last weekend. </p> <p>As with the Open platform, ONmail allows several people in the house to set-up their own free email account and send or receive emails using an infra-red keyboard or the special TV remote control. The big difference is that ONdigital uses translucent graphics over the top of the TV picture making it possible to send email at the same time as watching your favourite TV programmes. ONdigital plans to launch a full internet service later this year, though customers will need to purchase an additional small device containing a modem and software to sit on top of their set-top box. Inevitably, what we're seeing is a convergence of traditional internet and traditional TV. </p> <p>Although this will probably start with TV viewers sending emails to broadcasters and other users, it will almost certainly lead to web links within programmes and, eventually, to interactive advertising. On March 27, history was made when Britain's first interactive advert was screened on Sky. Viewers watching a commercial for Stir it Up from Chicken Tonight could - if they so wished - click on an icon that took them through to the Creative Kitchen service, and on Open where they could order a money-off voucher or a recipe book. </p> <p>While interactive advertising may prove to be the killer application for sit at home shopaholics there's no doubt that high speed internet access is causing the biggest stir in the digital broadcast world. Here, high speed broadband ADSL (Assymetric Digital Subscriber Line) and digital cable networks are set to make their mark where lower bandwidth networks, such as ONdigital and SkyDigital, can only sit on the sidelines and watch. Launched in the Hull region in January, Kingston Interactive's Television's ADSL network is currently the most advanced TV internet proposition. Available in 500 homes in the Hull area, it combines Video On Demand (VOD) and conventional television services with full 256Kb/s internet access and costs from \u00a314.99 per month. </p> <p>Other high-speed ADSL and digital cable services are also gradually becoming available. These include Home Choice in the London area which uses ADSL for high speed internet access via the PC and Cable and Wireless and Telewest which both provide walled-garden services to TV customers using broadband cable. In addition, Telewest has just announced its broadband \"Blue Yonder\" service which enables its south east cable customers to access the internet using a PC and cable modem at speeds up to 512Kbs - in other words eight times the speed of ISDN. The only drawback is the price. At \u00a350 per month it's not exactly cheap. </p> <p><strong>The interactive TV guinea pigs</strong><br> <strong>By Martin Wainwright</strong><br> Paul Hudson's company makes a crafty little gizmo called a \"changer\", which allows an assembly line in the bottling industry to adjust to different shapes for filling, capping or labelling. </p> <p>It may have been the similar flexibility of interactive TV that led him to ring Kingston Communications, the former municipal telephone company in his home city of Hull, to try out its ground-breaking system back in November. </p> <p>Four months on, Paul, 42, and his family are largely delighted with Kingston Interactive TV (KITV), which crams impressive amounts of data down a domestic phone line. </p> <p>\"It's really the number of things you can do at the same time without anything crashing,\" he says, punching a video order code on to his TV remote, while his teenage daughter Kirsty uses the phone upstairs - same line, different function, no interference - to talk to a friend. </p> <p>Mr Hudson had high hopes of the scheme when it was launched in the autumn. He had grown up with the city's unique and often innovatory telephone system, with its deliberately different white kiosks and a standard charge (now 5.5p) for a local call, even if it went on all day. Dating back to Kingston's foundation in 1904, this prin ciple has been updated by similar, standard payment internet provision; the Hudsons can spend an entire month on the internet, day and night for a flat rate of \u00a315. </p> <p>\"We've not been disappointed, though installation took longer than planned and we had a few hiccoughs at first,\" says Paul. \"Like with anything new, there were a few teething problems and Kingston were down at our house a bit more often than we'd expected.\" </p> <p>Once fitted, KITV is a modest affair in terms of space with only a set-top box (actually hidden under the Hudson's TV cabinet) and what Paul calls \"some sort of clever box\" tucked away on a wall where the phone line comes in, dividing ADSL cabling between the TV and the phones. </p> <p>The system offers the full 60 channels of satellite TV, email and internet on the TV screen with a remote keyboard, local services (\"That's what's on at the Odeon tonight,\" says Paul, tapping a couple more buttons), shopping and - the Hudsons' favourite - a video hire shop in their living room. </p> <p>\"You can call up any video you want from a huge catalogue,\" says Paul, checking the pin number of a tape he wants to watch later in the day. \"The beauty is, for a standard \u00a31.50 charge, you download it for 24 hours and you don't have to watch it then and there. You choose any time you want, pause it and replay it, just as if you were hiring it.\" </p> <p>The family isn't into emailing much, yet, but they gobble up the internet, which has made them friends across the world, helps Kirsty with her college assignments and found the family this year's holiday in Florida. They all tour their chosen hotel occasionally, watching a webcam film of it inside and out, before Paul flicks over to a chatline to talk to a new acquaintance in Australia. </p> <p>\"We met on the internet and he asked me to send some videos of Keeping Up Appearances,\" he says. \"He sends me David Bowie tapes.\" </p> <p>Kirsty, 17, who is studying sports science at Hull College, is an interactive TV convert too, mostly using the system to watch MTV and Sky, as well as seeking internet teen sites. She says: \"The great thing is being able to choose whatever you want when you want it - and not having to go to the video shop.\" </p> <p>KITV's general shopping channel is the big disappointment; at the moment it's got only one outlet and that's a home and car insurance company. </p> <p>KITV provides neat remote keyboards, allowing the Hudsons to write emails from their sofa in the way that an ordinary remote adjusts volume or switches between channels. Each device adds a little to the cost, which Mr Hudson is comparing with the notional cost of Sky, video and a conventional internet system. </p> <p>But the bills are virtual. Their prompt interest in the scheme won the family a year's free use of the complete system in return for acting as \"consultant\" guinea pigs, willing to fill in market research forms and trial new variations. If they were paying, says Kingston, the monthly bill would range from \u00a39.99 for the simplest BBC/ITV access to \u00a334 for all 60 satellite channels, including Sky's premium services, topped up with variable extras like video hire, commission on shopping and the \u00a315 internet charge. </p> <p> <strong> What's on offer</strong></p> <p> <strong> Analogue box/Internet TV Companies: </strong> Bush, Web2U <br> <strong> Pros: </strong> Cheap (about \u00a3100 for set-top box, from \u00a3200 for internet TV). Offer full internet access and free email. <br> <strong> Cons: </strong> Quite slow when accessing some web pages, images not as good as on PC. </p> <p><strong> Digital terrestrial box </strong></p> <p><strong>Companies: </strong> ONdigital <br> <strong> Pros: </strong> Set-top box is free to subscribers.

      "body": "<p>Like the many who've installed the program, I, too, became addicted to <a href=\"http://www.napster.com/\" target=\"_new\">Napster</a>. At least for a moment. Very basically, here's how it works. The audio information on the CDs that I play on my stereo can be stored very efficiently on my computer in a file format known as MP3. Each song is a separate file, that I can choose to play right on my computer, or on a portable MP3 device - something much like a Walkman, but with no cassette. </p> <p>Now, thanks to Napster, everyone on the internet can effortlessly share their MP3 files with one another. Once I install the program, I can search through and copy the MP3 files on anyone else's computer also running Napster, and they can search through and copy mine. Estimates of the number of Napster users ranges from the hundreds of thousands into the millions. </p> <p>Most of the debate about the Napster program, as well as the scores of other \"file sharing\" programs that are sure to emerge, are about copyright violation. Is it legal, or even fair, for consumers to give away perfect copies of music and cut the artist and record label out of their share of the profits? (Incidentally, as someone whose books are frequently photocopied for use by thousands of university students worldwide, I can honestly say it doesn't bother me in the least. But I'm sure it bothers my publishers.) </p> <p>The people suing Napster have claimed that the moment a person \"uploads\" a copyrighted song to the internet, that user has broken the law. But Napster users do not upload songs to the internet. They simply make the files on their hard drives in their own computers available to other people. It would be as if I let you enter my home library with a portable photocopier. </p> <p>Napster's advocates claim that it democratises the music industry, giving lesser-known bands a way to distribute their music in a marketplace dominated by monopolistic major labels. University students, in particular, who do not have enough money to feed their appetites for new music, have found a way to rotate their diet of tunes on a daily basis. Besides, many users sample new music online then go out and buy the artist's CD's, anyway. </p> <p>Still, I'm convinced that the popularity of Napster, and the behaviour of its users, has less to do with the love of music than it does with hatred of the recording industry. It's a consumer revolt. And, like anything to do with consumers, it's about getting stuff for the very sake of getting it. </p> <p>The music business created the very monsters it is trying to sue out of existence. When it moved from vinyl albums to less-expensively manufactured CDs, the price of albums did not go down, but up. The extra profit was not passed on to the artists, but to the distributors. Meanwhile, the recording industry's promotional arms have whetted an appetite for more music than it can produce, no matter how rapidly it churns out five-boy vocal bands with funny haircuts. </p> <p>Like any computer hack against a government or corporation, a consumer hack is based in the same sense of frustration and anger. Sure, I got an overwhelming thrill the first time I realised just how much music was available to me through Napster. I downloaded more than 50 songs the first night, then ran out of artists to search for and began using random names like \"John\" and \"love\" to find songs I may have forgotten about.

      "bodyText": "Like the many who've installed the program, I, too, became addicted to Napster. At least for a moment. Very basically, here's how it works. The audio information on the CDs that I play on my stereo can be stored very efficiently on my computer in a file format known as MP3. Each song is a separate file, that I can choose to play right on my computer, or on a portable MP3 device - something much like a Walkman, but with no cassette. Now, thanks to Napster, everyone on the internet can effortlessly share their MP3 files with one another. Once I install the program, I can search through and copy the MP3 files on anyone else's computer also running Napster, and they can search through and copy mine. Estimates of the number of Napster users ranges from the hundreds of thousands into the millions. Most of the debate about the Napster program, as well as the scores of other \"file sharing\" programs that are sure to emerge, are about copyright violation. Is it legal, or even fair, for consumers to give away perfect copies of music and cut the artist and record label out of their share of the profits? (Incidentally, as someone whose books are frequently photocopied for use by thousands of university students worldwide, I can honestly say it doesn't bother me in the least. But I'm sure it bothers my publishers.) The people suing Napster have claimed that the moment a person \"uploads\" a copyrighted song to the internet, that user has broken the law. But Napster users do not upload songs to the internet. They simply make the files on their hard drives in their own computers available to other people. It would be as if I let you enter my home library with a portable photocopier. Napster's advocates claim that it democratises the music industry, giving lesser-known bands a way to distribute their music in a marketplace dominated by monopolistic major labels. University students, in particular, who do not have enough money to feed their appetites for new music, have found a way to rotate their diet of tunes on a daily basis. Besides, many users sample new music online then go out and buy the artist's CD's, anyway. Still, I'm convinced that the popularity of Napster, and the behaviour of its users, has less to do with the love of music than it does with hatred of the recording industry. It's a consumer revolt. And, like anything to do with consumers, it's about getting stuff for the very sake of getting it. The music business created the very monsters it is trying to sue out of existence. When it moved from vinyl albums to less-expensively manufactured CDs, the price of albums did not go down, but up. The extra profit was not passed on to the artists, but to the distributors. Meanwhile, the recording industry's promotional arms have whetted an appetite for more music than it can produce, no matter how rapidly it churns out five-boy vocal bands with funny haircuts. Like any computer hack against a government or corporation, a consumer hack is based in the same sense of frustration and anger. Sure, I got an overwhelming thrill the first time I realised just how much music was available to me through Napster. I downloaded more than 50 songs the first night, then ran out of artists to search for and began using random names like \"John\" and \"love\" to find songs I may have forgotten about. But this zeal had less to do with appreciation for the music itself than with the fact that I was getting it for free. (Most of the music one finds in the Napster libraries is the same pap available on top 40 radio, anyway.) Since that first week, I haven't used the program at all. Deep down, Napster appeals to those of us who can't imagine why a line of people would stretch around the corner unless someone were giving something away on the other end. These days, thanks to an endless succession of pitches designed to make us think of ourselves as consumers, this means most of us. Sometimes I worry that the liberation promised by the internet has reduced itself to an acceleration of this tendency alone.

As a Mafioso I knew I had to get accustomed to its company. It was in the rules,\" he said. \"The useless death of others, the unjust death of innocents, convinced me not to remain a Mafioso.\" \u0095 Tommaso Buscetta, Mafia turncoat, born July 13 1928; died April 2 2000",

The PC version not only looks better, it's more playable: the game design is much more suited to a keyboard/mouse interface than a control pad. The novel part of 2: Cueball is the use of a pair of disembodied hands to represent your opponent and the referee. The white-gloved hands were \"motion captured\" using high precision cyber-gloves. </p> <p> Otherwise it's much the same as usual. If you get bored with snooker and the numerous varieties of pool, 2: Cueball also includes games of darts and draughts and a one-armed bandit. If you'd really prefer an arcade blast, Maclean has also thrown in Dropzone, a Defender-style game that was a hit on the Atari 800 and Commodore 64 in the 1980s. Maybe 3: Cueball, if there is one, will include Maclean's wonderful International Karate Plus (IK+), which was one of the best games ever to grace the C64, because it's difficult to see what else can be done with snooker and pool. The early Jimmy White games were impressive when 3-D graphics and \"real physics\" were a novelty, and snooker was far easier to implement than something like basketball.

This thoroughly wastes the potential of a graphics engine that allows you to swoop right down to your stormtrooper's boots. The invigorating Star Wars atmosphere, only partially spoiled by a rocked-up soundtrack remix, is the real winner while the well designed levels go a long way to compensate for some of the problems. As the first RTS based on the Star Wars universe, Force Commander is bound to be popular. Unlike recent titles this just about deserves to be.

      "body": "<p> <strong> So sue you Yahoo! </strong><br> Sega, Nintendo, and Electronic Arts are suing Yahoo!, the web portal, for allegedly allowing the sale of pirated games on its auction site. Nintendo's lawyer, Richard Flamm, said: \"We have advised Yahoo! many times that easily identifiable counterfeit, unpublished and illegal goods are being sold on its site, and we have asked them to implement effective controls to prevent the posting of illegal goods. Yet while it has the responsibility and capability, it has refused to do this.\" </p> <p><strong> Cheques and balances</strong><br> Sony is going into the online banking business with its new PlayStation2 game console. Sony will offer the service in Japan in conjunction with Sakura Bank Ltd and US-based investment bank, JP Morgan and Co. Sony is contributing $284m or 80% of the bank's $356m start-up capital. Last week, Sakura Bank also announced plans for online banking services accessible via mobile phones supplied by Japan's biggest mobile phone company, NTT DoCoMo. </p> <p><strong>Lara puts Posh in the shade</strong><br> Tomb Raider heroine Lara Croft has beaten Posh Spice and Andrea Corr to win the Female Sunglasses Wearer of the Year competition. The award was collected by the current official Lara lookalike, American model Lara Weller, and the event will be featured in Hello! magazine, which sponsored the competition. </p> <p><strong> Lord British moves on</strong><br> \"Lord British\", otherwise known as Richard Garriott, has left Origin, the games company he co-founded with his brother about 15 years ago. It's not clear why he left, but Origin has just \"adjusted\" its workforce by getting rid of 20 staff, and Origin's latest and greatest product, Ultima IX: Ascension, has had problems. Gameswatch's reviewer couldn't even get it to run. Origin became famous for its Wing Commander and Ultima series, and was taken over by the largest independent games company, Electronic Arts. Ultima Online has about 165,000 subscribers. </p> <p><strong>Allegiance</strong><br> Microsoft has announced the start of a \"server spawn\" programme for Allegiance, its next multiplayer space combat game. Usually publishers sell or give away the client (PC) versions of multiplayer games and may charge users to access their servers. However, Microsoft is giving a server version away with the retail game for users who don't want to pay up to $10 a month to use the <a href=\"http://www.zone.com/allegiance\" target=\"_new\">MSN Gaming Zone</a>. Free-play servers will also be listed automatically on Microsoft's Allegiance site. </p> <p><strong> Infogrames up</strong><br> The claimed slowdown in the games business hasn't hurt France's Infogrames too badly. In the second half of 1999, it increased its turnover by 65% to Euro 276.8m (\u00a3167m), and its profits by 81% to Euro 18.1m (\u00a311m). </p> <p><strong> My other car is a Corgi</strong><br> Electronic Arts says it has signed a unique cross promotion deal with film company Buena Vista International, a Disney subsidiary. The forthcoming BVI blockbuster Gone In 60 Seconds (Nick Cage, Vinnie Jones) will promote EA's Need for Speed: Porsche 2000 game, while the game will promote the film. This is especially good news for the Porsche 911 GT3, which gets promoted by both. Unfortunately, the average game player probably isn't old enough to drive one, and couldn't afford the insurance if he was.</p>",

Nintendo's lawyer, Richard Flamm, said: \"We have advised Yahoo! many times that easily identifiable counterfeit, unpublished and illegal goods are being sold on its site, and we have asked them to implement effective controls to prevent the posting of illegal goods. Yet while it has the responsibility and capability, it has refused to do this.\" Cheques and balances Sony is going into the online banking business with its new PlayStation2 game console. Sony will offer the service in Japan in conjunction with Sakura Bank Ltd and US-based investment bank, JP Morgan and Co. Sony is contributing $284m or 80% of the bank's $356m start-up capital. Last week, Sakura Bank also announced plans for online banking services accessible via mobile phones supplied by Japan's biggest mobile phone company, NTT DoCoMo. Lara puts Posh in the shade Tomb Raider heroine Lara Croft has beaten Posh Spice and Andrea Corr to win the Female Sunglasses Wearer of the Year competition. The award was collected by the current official Lara lookalike, American model Lara Weller, and the event will be featured in Hello! magazine, which sponsored the competition. Lord British moves on \"Lord British\", otherwise known as Richard Garriott, has left Origin, the games company he co-founded with his brother about 15 years ago. It's not clear why he left, but Origin has just \"adjusted\" its workforce by getting rid of 20 staff, and Origin's latest and greatest product, Ultima IX: Ascension, has had problems. Gameswatch's reviewer couldn't even get it to run. Origin became famous for its Wing Commander and Ultima series, and was taken over by the largest independent games company, Electronic Arts. Ultima Online has about 165,000 subscribers. Allegiance Microsoft has announced the start of a \"server spawn\" programme for Allegiance, its next multiplayer space combat game. Usually publishers sell or give away the client (PC) versions of multiplayer games and may charge users to access their servers. However, Microsoft is giving a server version away with the retail game for users who don't want to pay up to $10 a month to use the MSN Gaming Zone. Free-play servers will also be listed automatically on Microsoft's Allegiance site. Infogrames up The claimed slowdown in the games business hasn't hurt France's Infogrames too badly. In the second half of 1999, it increased its turnover by 65% to Euro 276.8m (\u00a3167m), and its profits by 81% to Euro 18.1m (\u00a311m). My other car is a Corgi Electronic Arts says it has signed a unique cross promotion deal with film company Buena Vista International, a Disney subsidiary. The forthcoming BVI blockbuster Gone In 60 Seconds (Nick Cage, Vinnie Jones) will promote EA's Need for Speed: Porsche 2000 game, while the game will promote the film. This is especially good news for the Porsche 911 GT3, which gets promoted by both. Unfortunately, the average game player probably isn't old enough to drive one, and couldn't afford the insurance if he was.",

      "bodyText": "Japanese authorities issued masks, goggles and helmets to residents near the rumbling Mount Usu volcano yesterday amid growing fears of landslides and another eruption more devastating than anything seen so far. Craters on Mt Usu on the northern island of Hokkaido have been belching huge plumes of smoke since the eruption on Friday, the first in 22 years, but scientists warned that the real fireworks may be yet to come. Huge cracks have appeared around the base of the 2,400ft mountain, swallowing houses and damaging buildings, as magma pushes close to the earth's surface. Professor Hiromu Okada from Hokkaido University said this indicated the rapid formation of a new lava dome, which was likely to rise up with explosive force in the next one or two weeks to form a new mountain. Unlike the weekend eruptions, this could create the most dangerous of volcanic phenomena: a flow of superheated ash, gas and molten rock. \"I am more scared of the new cracks that have been discovered over the past few days,\" an official at the meteorological agency said. \"It is possible that an explosion, blowing off the whole area, could occur.\" In the nearby town of Sobetsu, town officials began distributing goggles and masks to protect residents against clouds of ash, the longest of which stretched more than 12 miles from the mountain. Schoolchildren were given helmets to protect them from the flying rocks that are likely to fly through the air if the mountain blows again. NHK news said it had found a huge boulder that flew hundreds of meters at the weekend. Yesterday huge mudslides, a mixture of volcanic ash and rock, began flowing down the mountain slopes towards the hot spring resort of Akira Miura. Officials warned that the 1.6 inches of rain expected overnight could further dislodge the loose volcanic ash, rock and debris that has accumulated on the mountain's slopes over the past few days. By early evening, television footage taken from helicopters showed huge streams flowing down the smoking sides of Mt Usu into channels built after the last eruption in 1978. Although the towns at the foot of the mountain are now deserted, evacuees feared that the channels would burst and their homes would be ruined. More than 15,000 people have been evacuated from a 16,000 acre zone around Mt Usu since the volcano showed signs of activity last week. Thousands are living in gymnasiums and public halls, waiting for the all clear so that they can go back to their homes, farms and offices. But there is no sign that they will be able to do so any time soon. In 1943 - the last time Mt Usu experienced such intense geological activity - there were more than 10 powerful explosions over a four-month period before the mountain settled down. Even if people eventually return, it is unlikely that they will ever feel the same about living in the shadow of a volcano. \"You see the smoke rising, and you realise that the mountain is a living thing,\" one resident, Matsue Takahata, said. \"It's frightening.\"",

      "bodyText": "The plume of ash roiling into the air out of Mount Usu looks awesome enough. But it is all the more fearful when you realise that Usu is a mere junior branch of a much larger volcano, Toya, on whose rim it lies. Fortunately, there now seems little chance of a repeat of the gigantic eruption which ripped open the earth's crust where Toya lies, leaving a lake. But Toya's power lives on in the regular eruptions of smaller volcanoes like Usu. What Japanese scientists, admired as some of the world's most experienced volcano-watchers, now fear is a fresh explosion leading to the devastating phenomenon known as \"pyroclastic flow.\" The danger signs are the cracks appearing on the slopes of the volcano below where the most recent explosions have taken place. This suggests that the molten rock just beneath the surface - called magma when it is inside the volcano, lava when it it outside - is forming a lava dome, a cap of hardening rock plugging the efforts of the magma to burst out. It is this build-up of pressure, combined with rock falling off the steepening sides of the lava dome, which could be violently released by a new explosion and a pyroclastic flow. This is an avalanche of hot gas, rock and ash which races from the flanks of the volcano down neighbouring river valleys at speeds of up to 90mph, laying waste to any people, animals or vegetation unfortunate enough to be in its path. Moving above and with the avalanche is an \"ash cloud surge\", a cloud of superheated ash which can spread destruction far beyond the main flow. The devastation is sudden and unpredictable, if localised, hence the need for evacuation. Between 1995 and 1997, the growth and collapse of lava domes and the subsequent explosions and pyroclastic flows from the Soufriere Hills volcano devastated entire communities and the airport on the island of Montserrat. Residents, who were ordered to retreat in successive evacuations, were stunned - the volcano had not erupted in 400 years. Mount Usu's rumblings come as less of a surprise - the volcano last erupted 22 years ago.",

In the past week, the government has closed cattle markets, sealed off affected areas and begun the slaughter of infected animals. But farmers fear that conventional quarantine methods are not enough to contain the apparently air-borne virus. The highly contagious disease, which does not affect humans, is often described as the \"black plague for livestock\" and was last seen in Korea in 1934. It reappeared last month in cattle in Paju, 18 miles north of Seoul, soon after the area was buffeted by one of the yellow dust storms that blow in from China. Since then, the disease has spread rapidly to the country's main farming region of Poryong, prompting the government to set up an emergency taskforce to try to halt a nationwide epidemic. \"This week will be a critical period that will determine the development of the epidemic,\" said an official of the National Veterinarian and Quarantine Service. Officials have slaughtered and buried 255 pigs and cows and closed 85% of the country's cattle markets. Roadblocks established in a 12-mile radius of the affected areas check vehicles and fumigate them before allowing them through. In a race to beat the disease, agriculture officials have be gun injecting cattle with vaccines, many of which have been imported from Britain. \"If there are more outbreaks of suspected foot and mouth disease in other areas, emergency measures to contain the disease could last until June,\" a ministry official said. \"We plan to inject vaccine to 11m head of livestock in Korea step by step, beginning in the western coastal areas.\" Neighbouring Japan has suffered its first cases of the disease since 1908 at a small farm in Miyazaki, a well-known beef-producing region in the south-west of the country. Australia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore have banned imports from both countries. The infection is believed to have come from northern China, which suffered an outbreak of foot and mouth late last year. Although some experts claim it was carried by humans or infected hay, the main finger of blame has been pointed at the yellow dust winds from the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts. South Koreans have long lived in terror of these winds, which usually hit the country about four times a year but have become more intense and frequent because of the desertification of northern China. Known as \"spring's uninvited guest\", the storms cause visibility problems for airline pilots, and damage machinery. They are blamed for acid rain and respiratory problems because they contain so many pollutants from Chinese factories. Although the dust takes three or four days to cross the Western Sea, scientists say the foot and mouth virus can survive because of the temperature and humidity of the winds. If the disease is indeed carried through the air, the epi demic will be difficult to halt. \"How can we control something that is in the air?\" asked one government official. Farmers involved in South Korea's nearly \u00a32bn livestock industry fear a repeat of the foot and mouth epidemic that struck Taiwan in 1997, prompting the slaughter of more than 3m pigs. The country's agriculture as a whole accounts for around 6% of GDP. South Korea does not export beef, but does export pork. Exporters had set a target of $400m for pork sales this year, almost all of it headed for Japan. \"If the outbreak spreads nationwide, the impact on Korea's livestock and related industries will be harsher than the financial crisis of late 1997,\" an industry source told local newspapers.

In an unusually swift transfer of power, Yoshiro Mori, a veteran of the ruling Liberal Democratic party, won approval from his party and both houses of parliament and was sworn in by the emperor to replace Mr Obuchi, who has been in a coma since suffering a stroke on Sunday. \"I have been praying for the prime minister's recovery,\" Mr Mori said in accepting the party presidency. \"I will do my best to live up to the nation's expectations.\" Although Mr Mori said his main priority will be to hoist Japan out of a decade-long economic rut, one of his first challenges will be to answer the growing suspicion that the ruling party's handling of his predecessor's illness was deceitful and undemocratic. In a bungled cover-up on Sunday, the government waited 22 hours before revealing that Mr Obuchi was in hospital. During that time, aides told reporters that the prime minister was going about his normal duties. Late Sunday evening, the government senior spokesman, Mikio Aoki, said at a brusque four-minute press conference that Mr Obuchi was in hospital suffering from exhaustion, though by that time he had already slipped into a coma. Until now, the government has explained its actions by saying that aides panicked and officials wanted to be sure of the prime minister's condition before making a statement.

This candid admission raises the suspicion that Mr Obuchi's security - and possibly his health - were compromised in an attempt to hide the problem from the public ahead of a general election which must be called by October. Questions remain about whether the LDP \"shadow shoguns\" were party to the decision to take the prime minister to hospital without an ambulance or a full security detail. According to the official line, no one in government or the LDP knew of the prime minister's whereabouts until five hours later. Such an explanation is incredible given Mr Obuchi's character - a party loyalist who rarely makes a move on his own - and the immediate threat of the Mount Usu volcano, which had erupted on Friday. Details also emerged yesterday of the punishing schedule that the 62-year-old prime minister, who has a heart pacemaker, followed after taking power in July 1998. Mr Saiki said that his boss has not taken a holiday since a two-day break last August and had barely half an hour to himself each day, which he usually spent reading the newspapers. Mr Obuchi reportedly slept for only four or five hours a day and would often wake in the middle of the night to pore over official papers, especially since the eruption of Mt Usu. This crushing workload has a familiar echo in Japan, where courts, the government and the media have recently begun to accept the growing dangers posed by karoshi (death by overwork). Mr Obuchi may yet recover, but his experience should provide a lesson for Mr Mori. \"We all tried to tell him to take a half-hour or an hour's break. We wanted him to relax,\" said Mr Saiki. \"He was exhausted with overwork. He was a very hardworking premier.\"",

Widespread corruption and mismanagement have driven Kenya's coffee industry toward collapse and thousands of coffee farmers like Mr Githendu over the edge. \"I decided one day that enough was enough. It was time to fight back,\" says Mr Githendu, who armed himself with a bow and some arrows and marched with hundreds of other farmers on the Mutitu coffee factory, which processes his coffee beans, and forcibly evicted the union officials who he says have been cheating farmers for years. Anger among coffee farmers has become so widespread that the actions of Mr Githendu and his colleagues have been repeated throughout Kenya's coffee-growing heartland in recent months. The farmers' quarrel is chiefly with corrupt union officials who have developed a complex web of bureaucracy which channels proceeds from the sale of coffee through union bank accounts, where the money is held indefinitely accruing interest. By employing a credit system to supply the farmers with essential fertilisers and pesticides, the unions have further tied the farmer to a system of dependency and debt. \"They pay us whatever is left after they have paid themselves and their friends,\" says Muri Kahunyo, Mr Githendu's neighbour.

      "bodyText": "In a report published yesterday the US National Academy of Sciences called for more stringent checks on genetically modified (GM) crops but concluded that there was no evidence that the new foods presented a threat to health. US environmentalists criticised the report, which is intended to provide a scientific basis for government regulatory policy. They questioned its finding that there was no \"strict distinction\" between the risks posed by GM and by conventionally bred foods, and argued that the experts conducting the study had been compromised by their links with the biotechnology industry. With an estimated 70m acres of US land planted with GM crops last year, the economic interests at stake are considerable. GM seed producers, distributors and food retailers have been under pressure since a European-led backlash against the technology. The Grocery Manufacturers of America welcomed the report, arguing that it \"reinforces longstanding analysis that the technology is safe.\" The academy's panel of experts, consisting of academic scientists, a lawyer and an environmentalist, focused on plants that had been genetically manipulated to make them resistant to pests. Perry Adkisson, the committee chairman, said: \"We found no strict distinction between the health and environmental risks posed by plants modified through modern genetic engineering techniques and those modified by conventional breeding practices. \"In other words, the breeding process is not the issue; it is the product that should be the focal point of regulation and public scrutiny. That is, just because a plant is trangenic doesn't make it dangerous,\" Prof Adkisson said. He said that both GM plants and conventional hybrids bred to resist pests could have an unintended impact on other insects, but added that \"the impact is likely to be smaller than that from chemical pesticides\". However, the panel recommended that further research be carried out on the effect of GM crops on biodiversity, and more studies on the threat that pest-resistance could be passed on to weeds. The report found that the transfer of genes between plants could lead to a concentration of toxins in crops. Its conclusion that there was no inherent difference between GM and conventional crops was attacked by environmentalists, who argue that the artificial methods used to persuade plant cells to accept DNA from quite different species, pose special risks. \"They are saying that as long as these crops are the same as unmodified foods, we are not going to regulate, and we are not going to label them as different,\" Andrew Kimbrell, the director of the Centre for Food Safety, said. \"If we were not planting and eating this food, it would be OK to talk about more research. But this report means the US public will remain a guinea pig for these foods without a choice in the matter.\" Critics said the report's cred ibility was undermined by the fact that most of the 12 panel members had some professional link with the biotechnology industry. One of the study's directors, Michael Phillips, left the panel's staff at short notice in July, seven months into the study, to take a job as a Washington lobbyist for the GM trade lobby, the Biotechnology Industry Organisation (BIO). In a letter to the academy, Dennis Kucinich, a Democratic congressman from Ohio, said four committee members received research funds from GM companies such as Monsanto, Novartis and Pioneer Hi-Bred. He pointed out that two others had worked as a lawyer and as an adviser to the biotech industry. The report's conclusions, Mr Kucinich said, \"are tainted by pervasive conflicts of interest among its authors\". The National Academy of Sciences acknowledged there were conflicts of interests among some committee members, but William Colglazier, executive director, said: \"We felt their experience would be invaluable to the committee...We reject claims that their conclusions are tainted.\"",

So it is only fitting that he should be the man to design yet another extraordinary building that is, in part, a memorial to the late guitarist. In June, the Experience Music Project (EMP) in Seattle will finally open its doors. Unless it is plagued by unforeseen glitches, it promises to be yet another triumph for the Los Angeles architect who has rewritten the rule book. For more than four decades, the Toronto-born Gehry, 70, has been creating eclectic buildings described by architectural critic Paul Goldberger in the New York Times as \"from an aesthetic standpoint among the most profound and brilliant works of architecture of our time\". The idea for the $100m (\u00a361m) Seattle project came from Paul Allen, the billionaire who co-founded Microsoft with Bill Gates in 1975 and was the company's executive vice-president until 1983. He now owns a raft of digital communications businesses, radio stations and the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team. Mr Allen was always a Hendrix fan and has what he believes to be the largest collection of Hendrix memorabilia in the world. Part of the aim of the EMP, an interactive music museum, was to pay homage to Hendrix - who died at the age of 28 in 1970 - in particular and to rock music in general, including all its influences from jazz and blues to hip-hop and rap. Gehry, famous for his \"chaotically ordered\" style, which he has described as being like a \"cocktail party\" of ideas and materials, was the obvious choice as architect. Mr Allen told Gehry that he fancied something \"swoopy\" and something swoopy is what he got. Gehry, a classical music lover, immersed himself in Hendrix's music before starting work and bought himself a bunch of electric guitars, which he cut up and used as a basis for the design. Perhaps not surprisingly, the colours of the EMP building are essentially those of electric guitars. At its highest, the EMP will rise to a not-quite-sky-kissing 26m (85ft) and incorporate 13,006 sq metres (140,000 sq ft) of space to house nine different \"icons\": the Sky Church, which will act as concert hall at night and gathering place by day; Crossroads, the main exhibit area with everything from Quincy Jones's trumpet to Kurt Cobain's handwritten song lyrics; the Sound Lab; the multi-media Artist's Journey; the Virtual Library; the Performance Stage, which seats 200 for masterclasses and smaller shows; the Studio; the Experience Arts Camp, which is for young people up to the age of 15 to study with musicians; and the Electric Bus, which will travel the country. Oral histories will feature artists from guitarist Chet Atkins to Billy Bragg, from country musician Buck Owens to Ice-T. The concert hall will have wheelchair-accessible seats available throughout the hall and not just in the front row. \"We set out to create a museum that would celebrate creativity and innovation and believed we had to be creative and innovative in the way that was accomplished,\" said Jody Patton, the co-founder of the project and Mr Allen's sister. For Washington state, which has been in the wars of late, the new building comes at a good time. When Seattle hosted the World Trade Organisation last November, anti-globalisation demonstrators brought the meeting to a halt and the police lost control of the streets. This week Washington state's iconic company, the software giant Microsoft, lost its battle with the government for violating antitrust laws and saw billions drift off its share price. But, on June 23, the organisers of the EMP are hoping that the building, which houses a shard from the last guitar Hendrix smashed - at the Saville theatre in London -as well as the old instruments of such icons as Muddy Waters and Bo Diddley, will help to rebuild Seattle and Washington state's self-esteem.

      "body": "<p>In the corridor of Carole Stone's Covent Garden flat, the party is swinging. Stone, Britain's best connected - or at least, most fearsomely organised - networker, is weaving through the crowd doing what she does best. \"This is Bill Bachle, he works with Steven Spielberg, this is Julie Mellor, head of the Equal Opportunities Commission, this is Malcolm Singer of the Yehudi Menuhin school, this is Tanya Wheway, she's been married four times.\" She disappears round the corner, leaving a small group of people blinking at each other under expensive lighting.</p> <p>Carole Stone is the sort of person who it is easy to hate. She files her \"friends\" in a database of 13,700 names, logging their marital status, CV outlines and history of attendance at her soirees, with a tick box for whether to invite them to her Christmas party. She holds monthly salons for 90 people, at least half of them regulars in the national press, and spends \u00a35,000 on her Christmas party. She has, on paper at least, all the credentials of a crawly sycophant or a shameless self promoter. And yet, while being one of the most successful socialisers in London, she is none of these things.</p> <p>The scene in Stone's flat on Monday night is the 57-year-old's picture of heaven. Ruth Evans (former director of the National Consumer Council) and Yve Newbold (former company secretary of Hanson) are exchanging cards in her hallway. Anneka Rice is squeezing past Virginia Bottomley, who is squashed against Joan Ruddock, who is rubbing shoulders with a generous smattering of BBC commissioning editors. \"Never thought I'd see Joan Ruddock and Virginia Bottomley having a civil conversation,\" hisses a delighted guest, before moving on to the room's most popular topics - Tony Blair (what a sinister bloke) and Greg Dyke (what a godsend).</p> <p>Stone presides over the carnival like an excited child. There is a flower in her hair, and a big, wide smile on her big, wide mouth. It is a party to which guests come alone, safe in the knowledge that however slight their connection to her, Stone will remember their names, occupations and who in the world they would most like to meet. And there's a good chance they'll meet them. Rory Bremner and Selina Scott always draw a crowd; Tony Benn might be there, or Ken Clarke, or Jeremy Irons or Lynda La Plante - all have been known to queue around the block to get into one of Stone's bashes. On the phone before the party, Stone apologises for the B-list jumble expected that night. \"There won't be any stars this time, I'm afraid. Last month I had the American ambassador and next month the Bishop of London is due, but no stars this time.\"</p> <p>The most surprising fixture in this jamboree is Stone herself. She is not a hostess in the tradition of the French salon - petite, exquisitely made up, with an artillery of witty epigrams waiting to be fired. Rather, she is loud and goofy, like a cockney Tigger in Winnie the Pooh, bounding through the flat, throwing her paws around the waists of shy or aloof guests, until their shyness or aloofness has been beaten into retreat. She is loud, in that way shy people who have forced themselves out of it often are. She physically grabs people, propelling them through the room and forcing them to chat. She is immensely likable.</p> <p>\"She has this absolute talent for putting people at their ease,\" says Sara Nathan, journalist and former editor at Channel 4. \"She knows how to get people to cut the crap,\" says Nancy Roberts, broadcaster and internet entrepreneur, \"how to leave their egos at the door.\"</p> <p>\"I am like a puppy dog,\" says Stone, who married the television current affairs journalist Richard Lindley in June. \"I always assume people are going to like me, not because I am wonderful, but because I like them. I am always slightly astonished if they say no, but I just wipe my nose and go off again. I'm sure a lot of people snub me and I don't realise it.\" This is not an act. In an industry where the parties are full of people sneaking hostile little looks around the room, Stone is a genuine antidote.</p> <p>She comes from a background a million miles from her status as London's media queen. Her grandfather was \"in and out of the workhouse\". Her father, when he left the army, opened a sweet shop in Maidstone, then a tobacconist's on a council estate in Southampton. \"Our little shop didn't do very well,\" she says. \"We were in the red-light district, so dadda had to supplement our income with the baker's round.\" Before she was 20, three things turned Stone into the compulsive socialiser she has become: her late brother Roger's schizophrenia, her father's impatience with him, and her mother's strong character.</p> <p>\"We never had people home when I was young. Dadda and Roger were always fighting. My father used to be a boxer in the army and there were lots of fisticuffs. I needed friends so much because if you wanted to go down and have a coffee in the Wimpy with Roger, nobody would come with you because he would probably throw the bloody coffee over them. I realised how important it was to have friends.\"</p> <p>Stone was a gawky girl, with huge feet and a big nose. She was painfully shy of her frame, her awkwardness, her zero confidence. Her mother, who one pictures in Stone's image but fiercer, tried to cajole her out of it. \"My mother had this openness and this search for knowledge. She was always saying, 'look around the next corner, sweetheart, always look around the next corner'.\"</p> <p>Her ambitions were vague however; Stone is no Becky Sharp. She dragged her feet round the circuit for shy girls with dim prospects: public speaking classes, secretarial college, the Youth Employment Bureau. Her mother kept on at her: \"Why don't you be a journalist, dear?\" she said, but the Youth Employment officer took one look at her and told her to stick to secretarial work.</p> <p>It was not long after Stone got a job as a secretary in the BBC's Southampton newsroom that she started holding little tuna bean salad lunches that cost her \u00a34.19 a head. She did it, she says, because the idea of mixing-up people she knew fascinated her. In the early days, this was a case of how would her cousin Irene get on with the weather caster at the station? As she got better connected, it became would William Waldegrave hit it off with Sinead Cusack? What if she introduced her mum to Claire Rayner, an agony aunt who might put her in touch with other mums of schizophrenic sons? The combinations were endless and Stone was an impassioned chemist.</p> <p>\"She is very straightforward and that makes a tremendous difference,\" says Nigel Osner, a lyricist and former barrister at the Lord Chancellor's office who has known Stone for many years. \"She is warm and interested and she loves helping people.\" Through Stone, Osner was introduced to a composer with whom he now collaborates. \"You drop in to see her and she will pick up the phone there and then and start calling people for you.\"</p> <p>It took a long time for her to grow this confident, however. \"When I entered a room, I didn't feel like, hi! It's me, I felt, gor blimey, it's me. I used to hero worship girls who were flighty and confident and slim because I was always overweight or big-boned as they used to call it. I looked at people with small noses thinking: why can't I look like that? There was a girl who always used to sit on the laps of the camera men; I thought if only I had the confidence to do that.\" Every morning, Stone hung around the newsroom door, waiting for someone else to arrive so she could sidle in undetected, in their wake.</p> <p>But she was good at her job. In spite of her nerves, Stone was gregarious, deeply interested in other people and not in that cut-eyed, socially defensive way. \"I was like my mother, who was never hindered by the fact she didn't go to university,\" she says. \"She wouldn't say, oh! they're much richer than us we can't talk to them, she'd say, ooh, I wonder how they get on? I wonder how they do things?\" This is Stone's philosophy, the \"ooh, fancy that\" approach to socialising.</p> <p>She gave her first-ever Christmas party in the mid-70s, and they grew in size, from 100, to 250, to 300, until in 1999 the guest list reached 1,100, a queue snaked round the block and the fire officer shut her down. After she left the BBC in 1990 and didn't have a regular job, Stone's Christmas party cost double her total earnings for that year (\u00a32,500), an indication that there is something mildly pathological about her socialising. She is obsessive, ultra-phobic, with the rare combination of claustrophobia and agoraphobia.</p> <p>What drives her, she says, is the alchemy of getting the guest list just right. \"It's not that I can pull people nobody else can pull, it's just that I can get the mix right. I love meeting people. If I miss something, I go into a decline. Everything is life or death to me. I make a drama of everything.\"</p> <p>After her start at Radio Brighton, Stone became a regional news producer and two years after that, she produced Woman's Hour and Down your Way. In 1977, at the age of 35, she got her big break and the job that would make her the nucleus of a vast network of contacts. \"I was asked if I would like to take over as producer of Any Questions. They said do you know about politics? Oh yes! I said and went to bed every night with Vascher's Parliamentary Companion. But it was absolutely right for me. It made me realise that people of extremely differing opinions don't mind meeting each other.\"</p> <p>It was a post she would hold for 10 years: that's four high-profile guests a week, for 40 weeks a year, for 10 years, equalling a contacts book of 1,600 former cabinet ministers, Booker prize winners, columnists and commentators. She kept them in a Filofax, but she was so scared of losing it that she photocopied it. Nine years ago, she went electronic. A technician sat in her office for three weeks, listening to her calls, watching her network, finally customising a database that allowed her in an instant to see who she'd neglected and who over-favoured.</p> <p>\"Sometimes you think, gor, blimey, I know all these people, isn't it sensational! You feel absolutely wow-wee. And then the other half of you thinks, since they say it's not what you know but who you know, why am I not running the country?\"</p> <p>\"Their great mistake was not making her producer of Question Time,\" says a BBC editor at her party. \"It's still not right as a programme and she would have kicked it into shape.\"</p> <p>She is making a good living, however. Stone's main source of income is as a media consultant, or a \"facilitator\", charging companies an annual fee to entertain their CEOs at one magnate-packed lunch a month. She recently hosted one for Marjorie Scardino, chief executive of the Pearson media group who turned up without a handbag and was \"natural, easy\", in spite of her unofficial status as Britain's most powerful woman. It is a title Stone might claim for herself. I ring to ask her to put me in touch with one of her clients, and 10 minutes later David Webster, the chairman of Safeway is on the phone, \"only too delighted\" to talk about her. \"We have an association with Carole that goes back many years,\" he says. She organises small lunches for the supermarket chain's CEOs. \"She is quite unique,\" says Webster. \"She has this natural, warm way and her contacts transcend all worlds: arts, media, industry, which we are able to meet in a relaxed atmosphere. I am a great fan of hers.\"</p> <p>Stone's salons, on the other hand, are free of charge, the fruit of her obsession. \"People come because I'm not threatening, because I like people. Friendship is the core of life for me. You've got to be prepared to pop over to someone and say, 'Hi, I'm Carole', and for them to say, 'Oh yeah, so what?' It doesn't matter that someone snubbed me. What does it matter?\"</p> <p>She does it because she loves it; because it is the next best thing to what, in her heart, she always wanted to be, which was famous. \"I always hoped I'd be a television personality, that I'd have my own shows, that I'd be the next Oprah Winfrey. But then, I suppose, my lunches are my shows.\" Her salon on Monday night fizzes with energy and she circulates not like a society queen, not like a hostess even, but like a woman regarding her own work, with wonder.</p>",

She is not a hostess in the tradition of the French salon - petite, exquisitely made up, with an artillery of witty epigrams waiting to be fired. Rather, she is loud and goofy, like a cockney Tigger in Winnie the Pooh, bounding through the flat, throwing her paws around the waists of shy or aloof guests, until their shyness or aloofness has been beaten into retreat. She is loud, in that way shy people who have forced themselves out of it often are. She physically grabs people, propelling them through the room and forcing them to chat. She is immensely likable. \"She has this absolute talent for putting people at their ease,\" says Sara Nathan, journalist and former editor at Channel 4. \"She knows how to get people to cut the crap,\" says Nancy Roberts, broadcaster and internet entrepreneur, \"how to leave their egos at the door.\" \"I am like a puppy dog,\" says Stone, who married the television current affairs journalist Richard Lindley in June. \"I always assume people are going to like me, not because I am wonderful, but because I like them. I am always slightly astonished if they say no, but I just wipe my nose and go off again. I'm sure a lot of people snub me and I don't realise it.\" This is not an act. In an industry where the parties are full of people sneaking hostile little looks around the room, Stone is a genuine antidote. She comes from a background a million miles from her status as London's media queen. Her grandfather was \"in and out of the workhouse\". Her father, when he left the army, opened a sweet shop in Maidstone, then a tobacconist's on a council estate in Southampton. \"Our little shop didn't do very well,\" she says. \"We were in the red-light district, so dadda had to supplement our income with the baker's round.\" Before she was 20, three things turned Stone into the compulsive socialiser she has become: her late brother Roger's schizophrenia, her father's impatience with him, and her mother's strong character. \"We never had people home when I was young. Dadda and Roger were always fighting. My father used to be a boxer in the army and there were lots of fisticuffs. I needed friends so much because if you wanted to go down and have a coffee in the Wimpy with Roger, nobody would come with you because he would probably throw the bloody coffee over them. I realised how important it was to have friends.\" Stone was a gawky girl, with huge feet and a big nose. She was painfully shy of her frame, her awkwardness, her zero confidence. Her mother, who one pictures in Stone's image but fiercer, tried to cajole her out of it. \"My mother had this openness and this search for knowledge. She was always saying, 'look around the next corner, sweetheart, always look around the next corner'.\" Her ambitions were vague however; Stone is no Becky Sharp. She dragged her feet round the circuit for shy girls with dim prospects: public speaking classes, secretarial college, the Youth Employment Bureau. Her mother kept on at her: \"Why don't you be a journalist, dear?\" she said, but the Youth Employment officer took one look at her and told her to stick to secretarial work. It was not long after Stone got a job as a secretary in the BBC's Southampton newsroom that she started holding little tuna bean salad lunches that cost her \u00a34.19 a head. She did it, she says, because the idea of mixing-up people she knew fascinated her. In the early days, this was a case of how would her cousin Irene get on with the weather caster at the station? As she got better connected, it became would William Waldegrave hit it off with Sinead Cusack? What if she introduced her mum to Claire Rayner, an agony aunt who might put her in touch with other mums of schizophrenic sons? The combinations were endless and Stone was an impassioned chemist. \"She is very straightforward and that makes a tremendous difference,\" says Nigel Osner, a lyricist and former barrister at the Lord Chancellor's office who has known Stone for many years. \"She is warm and interested and she loves helping people.\" Through Stone, Osner was introduced to a composer with whom he now collaborates. \"You drop in to see her and she will pick up the phone there and then and start calling people for you.\" It took a long time for her to grow this confident, however. \"When I entered a room, I didn't feel like, hi! It's me, I felt, gor blimey, it's me. I used to hero worship girls who were flighty and confident and slim because I was always overweight or big-boned as they used to call it. I looked at people with small noses thinking: why can't I look like that? There was a girl who always used to sit on the laps of the camera men; I thought if only I had the confidence to do that.\" Every morning, Stone hung around the newsroom door, waiting for someone else to arrive so she could sidle in undetected, in their wake. But she was good at her job. In spite of her nerves, Stone was gregarious, deeply interested in other people and not in that cut-eyed, socially defensive way. \"I was like my mother, who was never hindered by the fact she didn't go to university,\" she says. \"She wouldn't say, oh! they're much richer than us we can't talk to them, she'd say, ooh, I wonder how they get on? I wonder how they do things?\" This is Stone's philosophy, the \"ooh, fancy that\" approach to socialising. She gave her first-ever Christmas party in the mid-70s, and they grew in size, from 100, to 250, to 300, until in 1999 the guest list reached 1,100, a queue snaked round the block and the fire officer shut her down. After she left the BBC in 1990 and didn't have a regular job, Stone's Christmas party cost double her total earnings for that year (\u00a32,500), an indication that there is something mildly pathological about her socialising. She is obsessive, ultra-phobic, with the rare combination of claustrophobia and agoraphobia. What drives her, she says, is the alchemy of getting the guest list just right. \"It's not that I can pull people nobody else can pull, it's just that I can get the mix right. I love meeting people. If I miss something, I go into a decline. Everything is life or death to me. I make a drama of everything.\" After her start at Radio Brighton, Stone became a regional news producer and two years after that, she produced Woman's Hour and Down your Way. In 1977, at the age of 35, she got her big break and the job that would make her the nucleus of a vast network of contacts. \"I was asked if I would like to take over as producer of Any Questions. They said do you know about politics? Oh yes! I said and went to bed every night with Vascher's Parliamentary Companion. But it was absolutely right for me. It made me realise that people of extremely differing opinions don't mind meeting each other.\" It was a post she would hold for 10 years: that's four high-profile guests a week, for 40 weeks a year, for 10 years, equalling a contacts book of 1,600 former cabinet ministers, Booker prize winners, columnists and commentators. She kept them in a Filofax, but she was so scared of losing it that she photocopied it. Nine years ago, she went electronic. A technician sat in her office for three weeks, listening to her calls, watching her network, finally customising a database that allowed her in an instant to see who she'd neglected and who over-favoured. \"Sometimes you think, gor, blimey, I know all these people, isn't it sensational! You feel absolutely wow-wee. And then the other half of you thinks, since they say it's not what you know but who you know, why am I not running the country?\" \"Their great mistake was not making her producer of Question Time,\" says a BBC editor at her party. \"It's still not right as a programme and she would have kicked it into shape.\" She is making a good living, however. Stone's main source of income is as a media consultant, or a \"facilitator\", charging companies an annual fee to entertain their CEOs at one magnate-packed lunch a month. She recently hosted one for Marjorie Scardino, chief executive of the Pearson media group who turned up without a handbag and was \"natural, easy\", in spite of her unofficial status as Britain's most powerful woman. It is a title Stone might claim for herself. I ring to ask her to put me in touch with one of her clients, and 10 minutes later David Webster, the chairman of Safeway is on the phone, \"only too delighted\" to talk about her. \"We have an association with Carole that goes back many years,\" he says. She organises small lunches for the supermarket chain's CEOs. \"She is quite unique,\" says Webster. \"She has this natural, warm way and her contacts transcend all worlds: arts, media, industry, which we are able to meet in a relaxed atmosphere. I am a great fan of hers.\" Stone's salons, on the other hand, are free of charge, the fruit of her obsession. \"People come because I'm not threatening, because I like people. Friendship is the core of life for me. You've got to be prepared to pop over to someone and say, 'Hi, I'm Carole', and for them to say, 'Oh yeah, so what?' It doesn't matter that someone snubbed me. What does it matter?\" She does it because she loves it; because it is the next best thing to what, in her heart, she always wanted to be, which was famous. \"I always hoped I'd be a television personality, that I'd have my own shows, that I'd be the next Oprah Winfrey. But then, I suppose, my lunches are my shows.\" Her salon on Monday night fizzes with energy and she circulates not like a society queen, not like a hostess even, but like a woman regarding her own work, with wonder.",

But New Labour's self-destructive response to Livingstone and its rubbishing of the GLC reveals something more fundamental: New Labour is built on a myth. It is a peculiarly English myth that the left, which gained such influence in the party in the late 70s and 80s, could be dismissed as either unreconstructed defenders of the command economy or as sectarian Trots. Sectarian Trots did indeed have a noisome presence in some branches of the Labour party. But Livingstone demonstrated another left, the memory of which seems to be repressed: a left that was innovative, radically democratic and determinedly egalitarian. It was a powerful and effective force. New Labour tried to kill it and then steal its clothes. \u0095 Hilary Wainwright is editor of Red Pepper. From 1982-6 she was assistant chief economic adviser to the GLC and directed its Popular Planning Unit",

      "body": "<p>Back in the 60s there was a black comedian called Charlie Williams. He said, in his broad Yorkshire accent: \"If you don't laugh, I'll bring my tribe in and we'll eat the lot of you.\" White audiences in northern working-men's clubs split their sides. In the 70s Williams was joined by Kenny Lynch, who made regular TV appearances as the butt of Bruce Forsyth's and Jimmy Tarbuck's jokes about black people. Then, in the 80s, came Lenny Henry, who wore a towering red, green and gold woolly hat and called himself Algernon Razzmatazz. His catchphrase was a croaky: \"Ooookaaaay!\" </p> <p>Black British comedy has come a long way since then, with the demise of the \"single black comic\" or SBC, who stood up alone to embody his race, then told offensive jokes about black people. In the 80s a boom in the number of black comics forced white audiences to broaden their notion of \"black humour\", while drawing increasing numbers of black people into comedy venues. These new comedy fans didn't want to hear their background mocked. </p> <p>Today the stand-up circuit boasts an array of black stars, such as Richard Blackwood, Felix Dexter, Junior Simpson, Gina Yashere, Curtis Walker, Robbie Gee, Angie Le Mar, Felicity Ethnic, Eddie Nestor, Geoff Schumann and Marcus Powell. \"It's almost certain that with a good bill, a black comedy night will sell out,\" says Roland Muldoon, artistic director of London's Hackney Empire, one of the leading venues for black comedy. </p> <p>On Monday black comics' achievements will be celebrated at the first Black International Comedy Awards (Bica). But before the comedy business starts patting itself on the back, there are a few problems to address. For a start, some \"black comedians\" don't even like the term. \"When I started out it was fine to call me a black comedian,\" says Richard Blackwood, the circuit's hottest property, who has his own show on Channel 4. \"But I think now I'm just a comedian. It's sad that when a black person is successful the issue of his or her colour always has to be there first, before what they have achieved. And I find this is very much from our own people too. I'd rather just be known as a comedian. It's obvious what race I am. It goes without saying.\" </p> <p>Even those closely involved with the awards would rather they didn't exist. \"In a perfect world the Bica would not be taking place,\" says Burt Laurent, its director. \"But we are not getting the recognition in the mainstream, so we have to do it ourselves.\" </p> <p>Curtis Walker, who has been a stand-up for 18 years, makes a similar point: \"Television has not done black comedy a favour. Every few years a black show comes along, then disappears. These shows should be an integral part of TV, not just put in the ghetto slot. But the change is starting to come, with more black comics doing mainstream shows. </p> <p>\"But if it wasn't for Charlie and Lenny doing what they did,\" he adds, \"a lot of black performers wouldn't be anywhere near telly today.\" </p> <p>So what exactly did they do? Williams, now 72, was the first black British comic to enjoy mainstream TV success. In the early 70s he was a resident on Granada TV's influential stand-up show The Comedians. He hosted the popular game show The Golden Shot and in 1973 topped the bill in Scarborough, breaking box- office records. Here's one of his jokes: \"I invited a fellow round to dinner last night. Half-way through the meal he says, 'I don't like your mother-in-law.' So I said, 'Leave her on the side of the plate and just eat the chips and peas.' \" </p> <p>Of course \"jokes\" like this were not the only kind the Yorkshire-born comedian did. \"When Enoch Powell said, 'Go home, black man,' I said, 'I've got a hell of a long wait for a bus to Barnsley,' \" Williams recalls. \"People would tell me that because I was coloured and had a Yorkshire dialect, it sounded funny, me telling them jokes. But I don't have any regrets. I told jokes that I thought would suit the audience.\" </p> <p>\"I was telling jokes for a human race,\" Williams continues. \"So people could have a laugh. There are Jewish jokes, Irish jokes, Scottish ones. So why not coloureds? If you stop telling jokes about the nationalities, you've got nothing left. But if you were offended I apologise. I didn't set out to offend. I went out so that people could laugh.\" </p> <p>Williams says he wasn't an SBC. Not exactly. He met two other comics on The Comedians - Josh White and Sammy Thomas - both from Lancashire. He says he was the only black comic on the Yorkshire club circuit but recalls someone before him, when Williams was still a professional footballer for Doncaster Rovers. \"There was a man called Astor Garricks - a comedian. I remember him because he was a big supporter of Middlesbrough. </p> <p>\"One game, I heard a booming voice behind Middlesbrough's goal: 'This place ain't big enough for the two of us!' It was Astor. He was well-known in the northern clubs. He was different from any other performer I'd seen because he didn't just stay on the stage. He'd climb down into the audience and walk around. He was a 6ft 2in black man. And I was half-caste. Astor used to say to the audience: 'If you don't laugh at my jokes I'll eat you up. I've had a missionary for my tea before.' \" Williams chuckles. \"It was kind of funny, them days.\" </p> <p>In his 1995 biography, Lenny Henry says that at 16 he knew he didn't want to do the kind of comedy Williams did. Yet at the start of his career Henry spent five years as the SBC touring with the Black and White Minstrel Show. He also regretted doing the kind of joke where he would wipe his sweating brow and say he was leaking chocolate. He writes: \"I knew there had to be a better way of trying to put your messages over, putting your jokes over, without having to pick on people because of their colour or because of their race and gender.\" </p> <p>What's interesting about Henry's comedy is how it evolved in tandem with his sense of self.

      "bodyText": "Back in the 60s there was a black comedian called Charlie Williams. He said, in his broad Yorkshire accent: \"If you don't laugh, I'll bring my tribe in and we'll eat the lot of you.\" White audiences in northern working-men's clubs split their sides. In the 70s Williams was joined by Kenny Lynch, who made regular TV appearances as the butt of Bruce Forsyth's and Jimmy Tarbuck's jokes about black people. Then, in the 80s, came Lenny Henry, who wore a towering red, green and gold woolly hat and called himself Algernon Razzmatazz. His catchphrase was a croaky: \"Ooookaaaay!\" Black British comedy has come a long way since then, with the demise of the \"single black comic\" or SBC, who stood up alone to embody his race, then told offensive jokes about black people. In the 80s a boom in the number of black comics forced white audiences to broaden their notion of \"black humour\", while drawing increasing numbers of black people into comedy venues. These new comedy fans didn't want to hear their background mocked. Today the stand-up circuit boasts an array of black stars, such as Richard Blackwood, Felix Dexter, Junior Simpson, Gina Yashere, Curtis Walker, Robbie Gee, Angie Le Mar, Felicity Ethnic, Eddie Nestor, Geoff Schumann and Marcus Powell. \"It's almost certain that with a good bill, a black comedy night will sell out,\" says Roland Muldoon, artistic director of London's Hackney Empire, one of the leading venues for black comedy. On Monday black comics' achievements will be celebrated at the first Black International Comedy Awards (Bica). But before the comedy business starts patting itself on the back, there are a few problems to address. For a start, some \"black comedians\" don't even like the term. \"When I started out it was fine to call me a black comedian,\" says Richard Blackwood, the circuit's hottest property, who has his own show on Channel 4. \"But I think now I'm just a comedian. It's sad that when a black person is successful the issue of his or her colour always has to be there first, before what they have achieved. And I find this is very much from our own people too. I'd rather just be known as a comedian. It's obvious what race I am. It goes without saying.\" Even those closely involved with the awards would rather they didn't exist. \"In a perfect world the Bica would not be taking place,\" says Burt Laurent, its director. \"But we are not getting the recognition in the mainstream, so we have to do it ourselves.\" Curtis Walker, who has been a stand-up for 18 years, makes a similar point: \"Television has not done black comedy a favour. Every few years a black show comes along, then disappears. These shows should be an integral part of TV, not just put in the ghetto slot. But the change is starting to come, with more black comics doing mainstream shows. \"But if it wasn't for Charlie and Lenny doing what they did,\" he adds, \"a lot of black performers wouldn't be anywhere near telly today.\" So what exactly did they do? Williams, now 72, was the first black British comic to enjoy mainstream TV success. In the early 70s he was a resident on Granada TV's influential stand-up show The Comedians. He hosted the popular game show The Golden Shot and in 1973 topped the bill in Scarborough, breaking box- office records. Here's one of his jokes: \"I invited a fellow round to dinner last night. Half-way through the meal he says, 'I don't like your mother-in-law.' So I said, 'Leave her on the side of the plate and just eat the chips and peas.' \" Of course \"jokes\" like this were not the only kind the Yorkshire-born comedian did. \"When Enoch Powell said, 'Go home, black man,' I said, 'I've got a hell of a long wait for a bus to Barnsley,' \" Williams recalls. \"People would tell me that because I was coloured and had a Yorkshire dialect, it sounded funny, me telling them jokes. But I don't have any regrets. I told jokes that I thought would suit the audience.\" \"I was telling jokes for a human race,\" Williams continues. \"So people could have a laugh. There are Jewish jokes, Irish jokes, Scottish ones. So why not coloureds? If you stop telling jokes about the nationalities, you've got nothing left. But if you were offended I apologise. I didn't set out to offend. I went out so that people could laugh.\" Williams says he wasn't an SBC. Not exactly. He met two other comics on The Comedians - Josh White and Sammy Thomas - both from Lancashire. He says he was the only black comic on the Yorkshire club circuit but recalls someone before him, when Williams was still a professional footballer for Doncaster Rovers. \"There was a man called Astor Garricks - a comedian. I remember him because he was a big supporter of Middlesbrough. \"One game, I heard a booming voice behind Middlesbrough's goal: 'This place ain't big enough for the two of us!' It was Astor. He was well-known in the northern clubs. He was different from any other performer I'd seen because he didn't just stay on the stage. He'd climb down into the audience and walk around. He was a 6ft 2in black man. And I was half-caste. Astor used to say to the audience: 'If you don't laugh at my jokes I'll eat you up. I've had a missionary for my tea before.' \" Williams chuckles. \"It was kind of funny, them days.\" In his 1995 biography, Lenny Henry says that at 16 he knew he didn't want to do the kind of comedy Williams did. Yet at the start of his career Henry spent five years as the SBC touring with the Black and White Minstrel Show. He also regretted doing the kind of joke where he would wipe his sweating brow and say he was leaking chocolate. He writes: \"I knew there had to be a better way of trying to put your messages over, putting your jokes over, without having to pick on people because of their colour or because of their race and gender.\" What's interesting about Henry's comedy is how it evolved in tandem with his sense of self. There are few performers who publicly admit their mistakes and rectify them in front of you. Still, you sensed that when everyone was attacking Henry, they forgot that not every black person is going to be Malcolm X. And they don't have to be. But that's the SBC's burden. When Walker says the new kids on stage owe something to Henry, it is hard to disagree. With Williams, it's a bit easier. But there is no doubt he opened doors for Henry and many others. Direct evidence that Henry helped the new generation is The Real McCoy. A lot of material and writers for the BBC2 black and Asian comedy-sketch series came from Step Forward, a workshop Henry set up to find black and Asian talent, when he realised he was the only black writer working on the Lenny Henry Show. The black comedy circuit is not faultless - occasionally you still hear gags that are offensive to black people - but then no race is perfect, or homogenous. Yet there is something about the dynamic of this environment (a black comedian and a mainly black audience) that is very different from that of the SBC and a mainly white audience. This doesn't make these gags excusable, but the taste they leave in your mouth is nowhere near as bitter as it would once have been.

As little as two thousandths of an ounce can lead to coma, a few grams can kill. It used to be rare, but now the stuff is everywhere. Eric Betterton of the University of Arizona told the American Chemical Society that 5m kilos has already hit the road in US airbags. \"Given the huge surge in production, there exists a greatly increased potential for significant accidental spills and subsequent human exposure,\" he warned.</p> <p><strong> Thereby hangs a very long tail </strong><br> In 1996, the spacecraft Ulysses, which was supposed to be monitoring the sun's magnetic field, suddenly went bananas. More precisely, it sent off a set of puzzling readings which Geraint Jones of Imperial College and George Gloeckler of the University of Maryland finally make sense of in two papers in Nature today. Ulysses, they agree, had sailed through the unexpectedly-extended wake of comet Hyakutake. Nobody expected the trail of ionised particles to be anywhere near Ulysses at the time: Hyakutake was a half a billion kilometers away. \"That's more than three times the distance from the earth to the sun,\" said one researcher. \"It's just unbelievable.\" </p> <p><strong> For soy, read new sea food </strong><br> Paul Brown of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, has a new outlet for surplus soy beans. Eight or nine strains of Pacific salmon are now endangered, so it's farmed fish for a fulfilling future. But fish meal is too expensive to feed to fish. So let them eat beans, he says. Soy-fed fish excrete less phosphorus and nitrogen, which means less pollution. By 2035, fish farms could soak up between 40% and 90% of the current soybean output of the United States. He fed the stuff to yellow perch, which then produced quality fillets. He tried it on trout. Next trick: crustaceans, normally fed on cod bones, head and guts. \"There's a shortage of cod. Plus, cod racks don't keep well in storage. Lobster producers need a more storable feed,\" he said.</p> <p><strong> Not for delicate stomachs </strong><br> Being sick is time consuming, but not for thornback rays. A team from Aberdeen University report in Nature today that they fed chopped fish to Raja clavata and then an emetic. The rays didn't just bring up the food, they brought up their stomachs, inside out. They rinsed them by shaking in the water and swallowed them again. Gastric grooming was a useful way of getting rid of crunchy prawn shells. The process took as little as four seconds.</p>",

Eric Betterton of the University of Arizona told the American Chemical Society that 5m kilos has already hit the road in US airbags. \"Given the huge surge in production, there exists a greatly increased potential for significant accidental spills and subsequent human exposure,\" he warned. Thereby hangs a very long tail In 1996, the spacecraft Ulysses, which was supposed to be monitoring the sun's magnetic field, suddenly went bananas. More precisely, it sent off a set of puzzling readings which Geraint Jones of Imperial College and George Gloeckler of the University of Maryland finally make sense of in two papers in Nature today. Ulysses, they agree, had sailed through the unexpectedly-extended wake of comet Hyakutake. Nobody expected the trail of ionised particles to be anywhere near Ulysses at the time: Hyakutake was a half a billion kilometers away. \"That's more than three times the distance from the earth to the sun,\" said one researcher. \"It's just unbelievable.\" For soy, read new sea food Paul Brown of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, has a new outlet for surplus soy beans. Eight or nine strains of Pacific salmon are now endangered, so it's farmed fish for a fulfilling future. But fish meal is too expensive to feed to fish. So let them eat beans, he says. Soy-fed fish excrete less phosphorus and nitrogen, which means less pollution. By 2035, fish farms could soak up between 40% and 90% of the current soybean output of the United States. He fed the stuff to yellow perch, which then produced quality fillets. He tried it on trout. Next trick: crustaceans, normally fed on cod bones, head and guts. \"There's a shortage of cod. Plus, cod racks don't keep well in storage. Lobster producers need a more storable feed,\" he said. Not for delicate stomachs Being sick is time consuming, but not for thornback rays. A team from Aberdeen University report in Nature today that they fed chopped fish to Raja clavata and then an emetic. The rays didn't just bring up the food, they brought up their stomachs, inside out. They rinsed them by shaking in the water and swallowed them again. Gastric grooming was a useful way of getting rid of crunchy prawn shells. The process took as little as four seconds.",
