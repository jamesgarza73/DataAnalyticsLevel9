Now they are setting about dispelling the theory that they lack glitter on the pitch to go with the pots of gold. The First Division play-off hopefuls are through to the FA Cup fifth round after blitzing Derby with five second-half goals on an extraordinary night here, given the plodding stalemate contested by these sides at Ewood Park 10 days earlier. Before most of the Blackburn players had even worked up a bead of sweat Derby had manoeuvred an opening goal which stemmed from a dubious foul, awarded for Garry Flitcroft's challenge on Stefano Eranio, and the sense of irritation felt by the visitors seemed to affect their concentration. As the penalty area filled with bodies the Blackburn defence was guilty of some dreadful dithering and Chris Riggott timed his run exquisitely to head Craig Burley's free-kick beyond Brad Friedel. Riggott has now scored in all three domestic competitions and his emergence this season as a centre-half of some stature has probably been the most positive aspect of Derby's hitherto turbulent campaign.

That Blackburn had lost only one of their previous 17 games suggested they might give a better account of themselves in the second half and Souness's side grasped the initiative only three minutes after the restart. Just as Blackburn had been guilty of some dreadful ball-watching for the opening goal, Derby's defence dithered in clearing McAteer's corner.

      "body": "<p>The joys of the world wide web. No longer do you have to scour the high street or spend hours calling innumerable bucket shops only to be told that the \u00a369 flight to Barcelona you saw advertised is a one-way price and is only for flights leaving on the second Wednesday in months with the letter T in them... On the net, you can do your own searching, comparing and contrasting. The whole world is out there. Or is it? </p> <p>The reality is that tracking down that bargain flight can be as frustrating an experience as it ever was. Most sites - not unreasonably - constrain your flight search by day and time. The drawback of this is that the \u00a3150 fare to New York flagged on the front page may well be a real deal, but you've got no easy way of discovering when this fare is actually available. Last-minute holidays are easier to locate; if you've got the nerve to wait until a matter of days before you want to go, there are always bargains to be had. </p> <p>Sites and what they have on offer change daily. Many offer online booking, although if your departure date is less than a week away, you'll probably find that you'll have to book over the phone. Whatever you're looking for, try your search on at least three or four sites to get an idea of what's on offer. What follows is a very brief guide to several of the well established sites. </p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.cheapflights.com\">Cheap Flights</a></strong> is a huge search engine that allows you to search alphabetically for your destination and gives you a list of companies who have flights which may meet your requirements. You'll get a phone number and, if available, a URL of the company, whereupon you have to begin your search again. Nonetheless, this is a good starting point.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.airtickets.co.uk/\">Air Tickets</a></strong>. Don't be put off by its gaudy design. This is an excellent site that's easy to use, which consistently found the cheapest fares for my search. If your flight leaves in less than 10 days time you have to book by phone, but the phone team is available seven days a week. There is also hotel information and a few holiday offers. Also useful for flights is <strong><a href=\"http://www.1stnetflights.com/\">1st Net Flights</a></strong>.

      "bodyText": "The joys of the world wide web. No longer do you have to scour the high street or spend hours calling innumerable bucket shops only to be told that the \u00a369 flight to Barcelona you saw advertised is a one-way price and is only for flights leaving on the second Wednesday in months with the letter T in them... On the net, you can do your own searching, comparing and contrasting. The whole world is out there. Or is it? The reality is that tracking down that bargain flight can be as frustrating an experience as it ever was. Most sites - not unreasonably - constrain your flight search by day and time. The drawback of this is that the \u00a3150 fare to New York flagged on the front page may well be a real deal, but you've got no easy way of discovering when this fare is actually available. Last-minute holidays are easier to locate; if you've got the nerve to wait until a matter of days before you want to go, there are always bargains to be had. Sites and what they have on offer change daily. Many offer online booking, although if your departure date is less than a week away, you'll probably find that you'll have to book over the phone. Whatever you're looking for, try your search on at least three or four sites to get an idea of what's on offer. What follows is a very brief guide to several of the well established sites. Cheap Flights is a huge search engine that allows you to search alphabetically for your destination and gives you a list of companies who have flights which may meet your requirements. You'll get a phone number and, if available, a URL of the company, whereupon you have to begin your search again. Nonetheless, this is a good starting point. Air Tickets. Don't be put off by its gaudy design. This is an excellent site that's easy to use, which consistently found the cheapest fares for my search. If your flight leaves in less than 10 days time you have to book by phone, but the phone team is available seven days a week. There is also hotel information and a few holiday offers. Also useful for flights is 1st Net Flights. The Bob Geldof-backed Deckchair.com also deals only with flights. Once you get the hang of the slightly fiddly search function, it's a good site, even if it didn't come up with the cheapest deals. Its failure to mention tax until the final screen is annoying. Many sites offer both holidays and flights. Teletext's online presence is best for package holidays, but a nice extra is the flight arrivals checker, which gives up-to-the-minute arrival details for all the UK's main airports.

Thomas Cook, the granddaddy of package holidays, has a very impressive online presence, and makes the grand claim of possessing the internet's largest range of package holidays. \u00a31 is donated to UNICEF with every online booking.

It is one of the most successful series ever and has been televised in over 100 countries,\" said Brian Harris, chief executive of programme owner Pearson Television. </p> <p>At the height of its fame in the mid-90s, the show played to a weekly global audience of over 1bn dedicated fans, who tuned in to follow the melodramatic fortunes of the partially clothed cast.</p> <p>And it was such a sure-fire winner for early ITV schedules that the network even took the unusual step of investing in Baywatch when it was first threatened with the axe in the early 1990s. </p> <p>Even the stone-faced rock band New Order admitted to loving the show, and filmed one of their videos with Mr Hasselhoff and the rest of the cast. </p> <p>The plotlines and acting skills were of secondary importance to the looks of the cast, with the likes of Billy Warlock, Erika Eleniak and Yasmin Bleeth all chosen for their suitability as Athena poster pin-ups rather than as Emmy-winning actors. </p> <p>But the show fell on hard times following its move to Hawaii after union pay demands forced the series out of its Californian location. </p> <p>Pearson Television, which bought the show three years ago, today said: \"All good things must come to an end.</p> <p>One Pearson insider said: \"It was the law of diminishing returns. It just wasn't get the audiences any more.\"</p> <p>There will be one more series of the show.</p> <p>Was Baywatch sexist? <a href=\"http://talk.mediatheguardian.com/WebX?13@39.foxubXR1T6o^0@.ee7ef8d\">Talk about it here.</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Baywatch, the smash-hit TV series which turned Pamela Anderson into a tabloid icon, has finally hung up its bikini after a 13-year run. Broadcast bosses have left the US lifeguard drama out to dry after a location switch from Los Angeles to Hawaii failed to revive floundering ratings. Sources told MediaGuardian.co.uk the decision was made yesterday at a meeting of executives. The show was an instant success when it came to these shores in 1989, reviving the career of Knight Rider star David Hasselhoff and turning cast members into tabloid fixtures. \"Baywatch has been an incredible success story. It is one of the most successful series ever and has been televised in over 100 countries,\" said Brian Harris, chief executive of programme owner Pearson Television. At the height of its fame in the mid-90s, the show played to a weekly global audience of over 1bn dedicated fans, who tuned in to follow the melodramatic fortunes of the partially clothed cast. And it was such a sure-fire winner for early ITV schedules that the network even took the unusual step of investing in Baywatch when it was first threatened with the axe in the early 1990s. Even the stone-faced rock band New Order admitted to loving the show, and filmed one of their videos with Mr Hasselhoff and the rest of the cast. The plotlines and acting skills were of secondary importance to the looks of the cast, with the likes of Billy Warlock, Erika Eleniak and Yasmin Bleeth all chosen for their suitability as Athena poster pin-ups rather than as Emmy-winning actors. But the show fell on hard times following its move to Hawaii after union pay demands forced the series out of its Californian location. Pearson Television, which bought the show three years ago, today said: \"All good things must come to an end. One Pearson insider said: \"It was the law of diminishing returns. It just wasn't get the audiences any more.\" There will be one more series of the show. Was Baywatch sexist? Talk about it here.",

That was the argument of social entrepreneur Andrew Mawson, speaking at a seminar on sustainable funding organised by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO).

Two new 10-year plans on education and crime, parallelling the existing 10-year plans for health and transport, will be set out over the next month, starting with new ideas on teacher recruitment and retention this weekend leading to the publication of the education plan next week. The prime minister is also promising a further white paper on the knowledge based economy, greater resources for regional development agencies and new incentives for universities to become incubators for change. Meritocracy and choice, backed by yet more challenging targets for the public services, will be the key themes. The crime plan will centre on four major themes - mod ernising the courts, sentencing, police reform, and tackling the 100,000 hard core criminals. The courts reform will be based on the Auld inquiry into the courts. Thousands of cases which now qualify for jury trial are likely to be reserved for a new hybrid court consisting of a professional judge, or stipendiary, sitting with two lay magistrates. Juries would be reserved only for the most serious cases, under the proposals, which are contained in a report by Sir Robin Auld, the appeal judge. The police reform package may centre on four themes - use of new technolgy by the police including DNA, the likely shape of future crime, especially organised crime, the future structure of the police, including possibly regionalisation, and ensuring a greater police visibility in the streets, the single biggest complaint against the police. Ministers are keen on having police in supermarkets, post offices and community centres, an idea pillaged from New York. Jack Straw, the home secretary, has already set out plans to target 100,000 persistent offenders. A sentencing review already under way in the lord chancellor's department could end with a major change in the law. Mr Straw wants to accept the demand from the Association of Chief Police Officers to be allowed to disclose in court past criminal records of defendants. In the field of education, the focus in the 10-year plan will shift from reform of primary school reform to secondary schools, adult literacy and equal access to higher education. Fourteen-year-olds are to be given the option of a vocational path and the aim will be to \"customise\" qualifications to meet the needs of each pupil. Ministers will promise a big expansion of vocational GCSEs, which are being introduced in 2002. State schools, likely to be broken up into more specialist schools, will be urged to let their brightest students take GCSEs at 15, giving them time to take more A levels, AS levels, and the new \"world class\" advanced extension awards. Ministers are also to announce plans to make sure expansion of higher education does not exclude bright children from deprived areas. Twenty-seven universities are being targeted for extra money to recruit from more diverse areas.",

      "bodyText": "Not seen your MP in four years? Get ready for a politics-free 30-second doorstep chat before he or she gallops off to buttonhole a neighbour. Labour's general election candidates have been told to watch the clock and avoid difficult discussions about government policies in Operation Turnout which is to use \"blitzing\" - canvassing on the run - to win support. A Millbank guide sent to thousands of activists this month drills New Labour's crack troops on how to appear concerned while trawling for as many votes as possible in as little time as possible. Parliamentary hopefuls are instructed to spend no more than half a minute per doorstep after an advance guard of volunteers has knocked on doors so electors are ready and waiting for the visit chat. Labour supporters will enjoy a full half-minute of the candidate's precious time, which is half a minute longer than Liberal Democrat, Tory, nationalist or other voters will get - they are to be avoided altogether. Tricky subjects, such as why is the NHS in such poor shape or secondary class sizes are so big, are to be sidestepped in favour of a smile, handshake and plea for support. And after the 30 seconds is up, candidates must not dawdle to the next address. \"The MP or parliamentary spokesperson will (often literally) run from house to house as he or she is called over by one of the helpers,\" says the February issue of Countdown, a monthly Labour newsletter. \"The MP or parliamentary spokesperson should spend just 30 seconds or so with sympathetic voters (opposition voters having been screened out by the helpers), without getting waylaid in any heavy discussions.\" Any information gleaned from brief encounters, says the guide, should be used to add a \"simple handwritten PS\" to standard letters sent out later. Tories and Liberal Democrats use similar tactics and stalwarts of all parties attempt to keep opponents on the doorstep to waste their time. But given that the BBC calculates people speak about 180 words a minute, no more than 90 words will be spoken in a typical visit - or 45 words each if there is a conversation. That should be just long enough for a Labour candidate, perhaps, to say: \"Hello, lovely to see you again. I trust I can count on you to vote Labour so I can be an MP, concerned about your issues. Vote for me and I promise not to waste another 30 seconds of your time for four years. Goodbye.\"",

Last month, a wealthy businessman, Stuart Wheeler, gave \u00a35m to the Conservatives, a sum amounting to over one-third of their central income, declaring his support to be contingent upon the party remaining Eurosceptic and keeping Kenneth Clarke out of the leadership. Three other businessmen, two of whom are peers, recently admitted giving \u00a32m to the Labour party.</p> <p>This dependence is something new in modern British politics. Traditionally, the funding of the two major parties derived largely from institutional sources, companies and trade unions. In the early 80s, the trade unions provided no less than 75% of Labour's central income and companies just over 50% of the Tories' central income. In recent years, however, both parties have sought, with considerable success, to reduce their reliance upon institutions. This is particularly important for Labour since, as Tony Blair declared in September 1995: \"Nobody believes in this day and age that the business of the Labour party is to be the political arm of the trade union movement.\" Today, the bulk of party finance comes not from institutions but from individual donors.</p> <p>In an ideal world, political parties would be financed wholly through individual membership subscriptions. In no democracy, however, are parties able to support themselves entirely from their members. In Britain, with just 750,000 people belonging to the three main parties, it would hardly be possible for them to finance their activities by subscriptions alone.</p> <p>In the past, the gap was filled by institutional finance. But, with that source in decline, the major parties have fallen back on rich donors. Yet that source too may be under threat, since, under the provisions of the Political Parties, Referendums and Elections Act, the parties will now have to disclose both the names of donors and the size of their donations. This will no doubt embarrass many donors and may have the effect of curtailing their contributions. It has been alleged that, in the past, large donations to a political party increase one's chances of a knighthood or peerage. A large donation was a rich man's political levy enabling him to enter, if not the kingdom of heaven, then at least the house of lords. But sunlight, as Mr Justice Brandeis once said, is the best disinfectant. Perhaps, in future, a large gift to a party will be seen as a good reason not to give someone an honour rather than grounds to reward them with a peerage or knighthood.</p> <p>If the parties are to raise sufficient funds to carry out their democratic functions, therefore, they will need state aid. In Britain, the fundamental argument against it has always been that parties are voluntary organisations. Yet the principle of public funding is already accepted as part of our national life. Since 1937, the leader of the opposition has been paid a salary, while since 1975, the opposition parties in parliament have been in receipt of public funds - the so-called \"short money\" - to aid their parliamentary activities.</p> <p>Admittedly, aid to political parties for their activities outside parliament would be a new departure. Yet, money paid to the parties for their parliamentary activities inevitably increases the sum available for party work outside parliament.</p> <p>A prime reason why in Britain the state aids political parties is that the existence of a healthy party system is in the interests of democracy. Thus the opposition parties play as vital a role in preserving democracy as the government. The issue, therefore, is not whether a new principle ought to be introduced into our political life, but whether an already accepted principle should be extended.</p> <p>State aid to parties can take different forms. On the continent, the state generally funds parties in proportion to votes won or seats gained in general elections. This is said to devitalise democracy by making parties over-reliant on public funds and remote from their members and supporters. But the continental method is not the only way in which aid can be provided.</p> <p>In the US and Canada, aid is triggered in a different way, with individual contributions to candidates and parties qualifying for tax relief or tax credits. This is accepted as perfectly natural both on the left and on the right. Indeed, Ronald Reagan's libertarian principles did not prevent him from accepting public funds for his presidential campaigns in 1980 and 1984.</p> <p>In 1998, the Neill committee on standards in public life recommended aid in the form of tax relief on donations. But that would be inequitable since it would not benefit non-taxpayers - pensioners and students, for example - who might wish to give money to political parties.</p> <p>The thought behind the Neill proposal, however, was that the parties ought to broaden their basis of support and rely less on large donations. That could be achieved were aid to be made conditional upon some visible index of public support, such as party membership. As long ago as 1981, the Hansard Society's commission on the funding of political parties, chaired by the late Edmund Dell, to which I acted as secretary, proposed a system by which party membership subscriptions could trigger state aid. For each \u00a310 raised, for example, the state would make a matching payment of \u00a310 to the party.</p> <p>If a ceiling of aid were calculated such that, to achieve its maximum, each party would have to secure membership subscriptions from one in 12 of those who had voted for it in the previous general election, the total cost to the exchequer would be around \u00a330m a year, less than one-fifth of the annual cost of the driver and vehicle licensing agency. A system of this kind would encourage parties to seek new members and stimulate fundraising; and constituency organisations would probably become more lively and more representative organisations than they are today. Moreover, a legal limit could then be placed on the size of individual donations, thus further limiting the power of big money.</p> <p>The issue of how parties should be funded is not, then, one of freedom versus the state. Instead, with the decline of institutional funding, it has become one of whether the parties should rely on large donors, or on their members. With public funding, the special interests of the wealthy would be weakened while the general interest would be strengthened. Political parties would be compelled to rely upon a large number of small contributors rather than the tainted generosity of a few large contributors. The cost would be a small price to pay for improving the health of our democratic system.</p> <p>Vernon Bogdanor is professor of government at Oxford University</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Early in the next parliament would, of course, be within two years.\"</p> <p>If the prime minister had said the economic assessment might be held later than two years after the election, it would have opened the serious possibility of Britain not entering the euro within the next parliament.</p> <p>On the assumption that the Treasury concluded the British economy had met the five tests - especially that the British and European economies had converged - a Labour government would still have to hold a referendum , prepare notes and coins as well as negotiate with the EU on the entry rate for sterling against the euro .</p> <p>Alastair Campbell, the prime minister's press spokesman, said the referendum could be held within two years, but did not commit the government to this timetable.</p> <p>Mr Blair's remarks reflect a new confidence about the euro within government after its rise on the markets. Pro- euro cabinet ministers, including Stephen Byers and Robin Cook, have also noted the clear statements from car chiefs that they will disinvest unless there is a real prospect of sterling joining the euro . They were eager not to allow any backsliding from the policy after the resignation of the pro-European Peter Mandelson.</p> <p>Mr Hague later claimed that Mr Blair had \"just blown his policy on the single currency out of the water\" and \"given the pound two years to live\".

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair dramatically clarified his plans to take Britain into the single currency yesterday when he promised that a re-elected Labour government would decide within two years whether to hold a referendum . He promised the Treasury's assessment of the five economic tests for entry would be held within two years but vowed he would not bounce the British electorate by making the assessment within months of the election. It is the first time Mr Blair has defined the government's previously vague timescale to make the assessment \"early\" in the next parliament. He made the commitment in answer to a question from William Hague during prime minister's questions in the Commons. Mr Blair told a startled Mr Hague: \"Early in the next parliament means exactly what it says. Early in the next parliament would, of course, be within two years.\" If the prime minister had said the economic assessment might be held later than two years after the election, it would have opened the serious possibility of Britain not entering the euro within the next parliament. On the assumption that the Treasury concluded the British economy had met the five tests - especially that the British and European economies had converged - a Labour government would still have to hold a referendum , prepare notes and coins as well as negotiate with the EU on the entry rate for sterling against the euro . Alastair Campbell, the prime minister's press spokesman, said the referendum could be held within two years, but did not commit the government to this timetable. Mr Blair's remarks reflect a new confidence about the euro within government after its rise on the markets. Pro- euro cabinet ministers, including Stephen Byers and Robin Cook, have also noted the clear statements from car chiefs that they will disinvest unless there is a real prospect of sterling joining the euro . They were eager not to allow any backsliding from the policy after the resignation of the pro-European Peter Mandelson. Mr Hague later claimed that Mr Blair had \"just blown his policy on the single currency out of the water\" and \"given the pound two years to live\". He added: \"There can be no doubt that the fate of the pound will be a huge issue at the election.\" Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy led pro-Europeans in welcoming the move, but claimed it was too late. Even a pro- euro cabinet decision in 2002 would leave little time to complete the nuts-and-bolts moves to join the euro before the 2005-6 election, some experts warned. Eurosceptic claims that Mr Blair had effectively slapped down his chancellor, Gordon Brown, were dismissed by both Downing Street and the Treasury. Mr Blair will today put the creation of a meritocratic Britain at the top of Labour's priorities - and identify university elitism as a crucial barrier to be demolished. Following Mr Brown's attack last year on Oxbridge elitism, ministers have negotiated a package with 27 universities which currently recruit less than 80% of their students from state schools. All 27 will be monitored for year-on-year improvement as targeted schools also get extra help to raise their pupils' expectations, part of a drastic makeover for the comprehensive system to extol choice and diversity over regimentation. With Labour headquarters at Millbank gearing up for the expected May 3 election, the prime minister will use a speech at a north London school today to make a determined effort to persuade voters that, if re-elected, Labour will use its growing self-confidence and national affluence to be more radical than it has been since 1997. The cabinet remains committed to reform of the public services as the centrepiece of its campaign. To ram home his message Mr Blair will today promise to match his ambitious plans for transport and the NHS with sweeping 10-year plans to revitalise both education and the criminal justice system. The education plan will be unveiled next week, the crime plan later in the month as part of a flurry of announcements which precede Mr Brown's cautiously generous budget, probably on March 6 or 13. Today the prime minister will argue that better public service - above all, education - provides the best means to break down the barriers to what he will call \"a true meritocracy where people can rise according to their own ability\". Mr Blair will argue that Labour's task is to open up opportunity to all - not least by removing barriers of poverty, poor education, adult illiteracy and failing public services.",

      "bodyText": "HIT Entertainment, creator of kids' favourite Bob the Builder, has been given clearance to buy the US company behind Barney the Dinosaur. The Federal Trade Commission's website revealed that the UK company has been \"granted early termination\" to buy Lyrick Studios and its subsidiaries Big Feats and Lyons Partnership in an all-share deal. The announcement ends a week of speculation about HIT's mystery takeover target, after its shares were suspended at the beginning of the month pending an acquisition. A successful deal would bring together two of the most popular children's characters of recent times, with Barney selling over 130m videos and books worldwide. Lyrick is a much larger company than HIT, which is currently valued at \u00a3400m, but HIT has timed its move perfectly. Bob the Builder is one of the biggest children's TV hits on the BBC and a spin-off single went to number one at Christmas. It accounts for 60% of HIT's revenues, which hit \u00a320.3m last year but some analysts doubt if the character's success can last forever. \"HIT knows the success of Bob the Builder will not go on forever, so it is using its current strong share price to make an acquisition,\" said one analyst. A breakthrough in the US market would give Bob an extended lifespan, and is a key reason behind the move for Lyrick. Other mooted targets included EM.TV's Jim Henson Company, which makes the Muppets show. Lyrick's other characters include Wishbone the Jack Russell terrier, Joe Scruggs and Australian music group the Wiggles. HIT's shares were trading at 440p before their suspension.

      "body": "<p>Richard Southern, who has died aged 88, became a great medieval historian. But, as a schoolboy at Newcastle Royal Grammar School, he was unenthusiastic about history, seeing it to be a matter of dates and names.</p> <p>That changed when he was reading a book on the Tudors and his eye fell on the sentence, \"Henry VII was the first businessman to sit upon the English throne.\"</p> <p>In an instant the schoolboy understood. His father was a businessman, importing timber (the sign \"MH Southern and Brothers\" is still visible over the timber yard next to Bede's monastery in Jarrow). Young Southern had often seen his father and uncles stay up late with their account books, and now he knew how Henry VII had tackled government. He had moved from outside to inside history.</p> <p>The sentence about Henry VII was not, as it happens, historically correct. Southern recognised that later, but the damage had been done: he won the Domus exhibition to Balliol College, Oxford. There, he was attacked by a new kind of doubt, this time about the history course.</p> <p>The Oxford modern history school had been designed in the late 19th century by William Stubbs, as a documentary study of British constitutional development. That ideal began to look inadequate in 1929, with the Wall Street crash triggering the first mass unemployment and the League of Nations starting to look precarious. English constitutional development was not enough for Southern, and he thought he had picked the wrong course.</p> <p>Much later still, when Southern was appointed Oxford's Chichele professor in 1961, his earlier undergraduate doubts would bear rich fruit in his pellucid inaugural lecture, The Shape and Substance of Academic History, on the role of history in universities, and then as president of the Royal Historical Society from 1968-72, in four presidential lectures in which he explained how Europe came to interest itself in history at all. (The series is called Aspects of the European Tradition of Historical Writing, and is in the Transactions of the society for 1970-73.)</p> <p>The doubting undergraduate had been rescued by two Balliol tutors, who pulled him out from slightly different angles, but both in the right direction. One was Vivian Galbraith, ex-Public Record Office, who saw the historian's job as the interpretation of particular documents and who remained in Southern's memory as \"the most energising historian I have ever met\".</p> <p>The other was Maurice Powicke. Like Stubbs, Powicke saw history as past politics, but, unlike Stubbs, Powicke included in \"politics\" questions of family background, education, friendships, religion.</p> <p>An undergraduate essay Southern wrote won the Royal Historical Society's Alexander prize. It was on Ranulf Flambard, a careerist Anglo-Norman cleric. Galbraith had shown Southern some newly published charters of Flambard, and in the winter of 1930-31 Southern had studied them and worked them into the essay. He went on to win a first, and was taken up by Exeter College with a five-year junior research fellowship.</p> <p>Southern's undergraduate doubts had also led to a decision to take seriously his membership of the Church of England, into which he had been baptised. He remained a regular communicant, supporting - and occasionally preaching at - the chapels of his successive colleges, and latterly at St Giles' parish church.</p> <p>Southern was a fides quarens intellectum (a faith seeking understanding), with all the active and intellectual obligations the two parts of that formula respectively involve. He felt a natural attraction towards great figures in European history of whom the same was true, and brought to his own time an exceptional sympathy and perception as to their interpretation.</p> <p>St Anselm was the first. A monk, philosopher and second archbishop of Canterbury after the Norman Conquest, he had been a man of international stature and influence. Southern himself became a wandering scholar, to Paris, in 1933-34, to study under Ferdinand Lot, and also more briefly, in 1935, to Munich.</p> <p>In 1937, Galbraith left Oxford, and Balliol elected Southern to replace him as tutor. When the second world war broke out, Southern joined the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, moving in 1941 to the Durham Light Infantry as second lieutenant, and from there, in 1942, to the 155th regiment of the Royal Armoured Corps, where he became a tank commander.</p> <p>In 1943, he was promoted to captain and transferred again, to the political intelligence department of the Foreign Office. There, in 1944, he became a major, which entitled him to a secretary. The woman who took the job, Sheila Crichton-Miller, was the widow of an RAF hero recently killed in action, and her first act on arriving in the major's office was to cause ink to spill over his papers. They were married later that year.</p> <p>In 1945, Southern returned to Balliol to begin a 15-year period as tutor and university lecturer. In his first lecture he was embarrassed to find he had run short of material 15 minutes before the hour; so he simply said \"good morning\" and left. That never happened again. His lectures became proverbial for their well-ordered clarity and a quietly sparkling erudition.</p> <p>He had an unfailing gentleness of manner, but when there was disciplinary dirty work to be done at Balliol, the other dons, who included Christopher Hill and Michael Wallace-Hadrill, would pick on Southern to do it. The university took the same view, and made him a proctor for 1948-49.</p> <p>In l952 he was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and during a slow convalescence wrote The Making of the Middle Ages (1953), his first book. It has been translated into 27 languages.</p> <p>Southern would himself later voice the view that scholars should not write books until they have finished as full-time university teachers. His own career at least partially fits that principle. In 1961, he moved from Balliol to All Souls, with his appointment as Chichele professor, a post which entails much lecturing, in and out of Oxford, and graduate supervision, but no undergraduate tutoring.</p> <p>And his next two books were occasioned by invitations to lecture, outside Oxford: one from Harvard, which led in 1962 to the publication of his Western Views of Islam in the Middle Ages; another from Cambridge (to give the Birkbeck Lectures for 1959), which led to St Anselm and his Biographer (1963). It appeared almost simultaneously with his critical edition of the Life of St Anselm by Anselm's contemporary Eadmer, in the Oxford Medieval Texts series.</p> <p>In 1969, Southern resigned his chair to become president of St John's College, where he stayed until 1981. As president he remained a source of tireless encouragement to younger medievalists, especially graduate students. A visitor once expressed admiring astonishment, after a graduate seminar at which Southern had presided, that young speakers had joined in without giving any impression of being cowed by the great man's participation.</p> <p>On leaving the seminar, Southern confided his secret: \"You've got to let them crawl all over you.\" Any who came back to study in the unique Bodleian collections, and who lacked an Oxford toehold, would regularly be made welcome in the former servants' quarters of the President's Lodgings.</p> <p>In 1970, a year after his arrival at St John's, Western Society and the Church in the Middle Ages, Volume 2 in the Penguin History of the Church, appeared (Southern had at first been asked to write Volume 3 but had asked for and obtained a double chronological ration); and (in the same year) a collection of several of his earlier articles as Medieval Humanism and Other Studies.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Southern had turned increasingly to another model of fides quarens intellectum , Robert Grosseteste, the polymathic Oxford philosopher who became bishop of Lincoln, and died in 1254.</p> <p>Although Grosseteste was undoubtedly one of England's great men, his historiography had always bristled with problems, not least in that more than 2,500 manuscripts survive of his writings.</p> <p>Like Grosseteste at Lincoln, Richard Southern combined effective administration with exemplary scholarship, and his highly readable Robert Grosseteste: the Growth of an English Mind in Medieval Europe would permanently change scholarship on the subject.</p> <p>The book did not finally appear until 1987, when Southern and his wife had moved from the college to St John's Street - a world away, they sensed, from the university current, and the occasion of Southern's greatest literary productivity.</p> <p>His lifelong interest in St Anselm had led him to seek ever more exactitude in portraiture, and in 1990 a wholly recast version of his earlier book appeared as Saint Anselm: a Portrait in a Landscape.</p> <p>And at last, in 1995, there began to appear his most ambitious project. The formula fides quarens intellectum, while it fitted both Anselm and Grosseteste as individual giants, was in due measure the ideal of the scholastic enterprise as a whole, as it sought practicable answers to the questions posed by faith.</p> <p>Southern now wished to paint a \"portrait in a landscape\". Previous work had appeared in some of the essays in Medieval Humanism and Other Studies, but now the portrait was to take three volumes, as Scholastic Humanism and the Unification of Europe (the first volume appeared in 1995 and the second in 1999).</p> <p>This depicts Europe's universities from their beginnings, in the landscape that nurtured them and which they in turn shaped, as the inquiring, intellectually inventive element in a society otherwise authoritarian and hierarchical.</p> <p>Southern received many honorary degrees and other marks of distinction. He was knighted in 1974. In 1987, the Oxford modern history faculty was asked to enter a name (without its owner's knowledge) for an international prize offered that year by the Fondazione Internazionale Balzan for the \"greatest historian of medieval Europe\". The judges chose Southern.</p> <p>On receiving his prize of \u00a3100,000, the astonished winner at once handed it over to St Hilda's College, to start a fund for a medieval fellowship to be named after his own tutor, Galbraith. It was typical of his character.</p> <p>What of his historical writing? Southern once wrote: \"The first duty of the historian is to produce works of art. By this I do not primarily mean works that are finely written, but works which are emotionally and intellectually satisfying, that combine a clear unity of conception with a vivacity of detail, and portray people whose actions are intelligible within the framework of their circumstances and character.\"</p> <p>That describes his own work, which happily remains, to be read and re-read.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife Sheila and sons Andrew and Peter.</p>",

It appeared almost simultaneously with his critical edition of the Life of St Anselm by Anselm's contemporary Eadmer, in the Oxford Medieval Texts series. In 1969, Southern resigned his chair to become president of St John's College, where he stayed until 1981. As president he remained a source of tireless encouragement to younger medievalists, especially graduate students. A visitor once expressed admiring astonishment, after a graduate seminar at which Southern had presided, that young speakers had joined in without giving any impression of being cowed by the great man's participation. On leaving the seminar, Southern confided his secret: \"You've got to let them crawl all over you.\" Any who came back to study in the unique Bodleian collections, and who lacked an Oxford toehold, would regularly be made welcome in the former servants' quarters of the President's Lodgings. In 1970, a year after his arrival at St John's, Western Society and the Church in the Middle Ages, Volume 2 in the Penguin History of the Church, appeared (Southern had at first been asked to write Volume 3 but had asked for and obtained a double chronological ration); and (in the same year) a collection of several of his earlier articles as Medieval Humanism and Other Studies. Meanwhile, Southern had turned increasingly to another model of fides quarens intellectum , Robert Grosseteste, the polymathic Oxford philosopher who became bishop of Lincoln, and died in 1254. Although Grosseteste was undoubtedly one of England's great men, his historiography had always bristled with problems, not least in that more than 2,500 manuscripts survive of his writings. Like Grosseteste at Lincoln, Richard Southern combined effective administration with exemplary scholarship, and his highly readable Robert Grosseteste: the Growth of an English Mind in Medieval Europe would permanently change scholarship on the subject. The book did not finally appear until 1987, when Southern and his wife had moved from the college to St John's Street - a world away, they sensed, from the university current, and the occasion of Southern's greatest literary productivity. His lifelong interest in St Anselm had led him to seek ever more exactitude in portraiture, and in 1990 a wholly recast version of his earlier book appeared as Saint Anselm: a Portrait in a Landscape. And at last, in 1995, there began to appear his most ambitious project. The formula fides quarens intellectum, while it fitted both Anselm and Grosseteste as individual giants, was in due measure the ideal of the scholastic enterprise as a whole, as it sought practicable answers to the questions posed by faith. Southern now wished to paint a \"portrait in a landscape\". Previous work had appeared in some of the essays in Medieval Humanism and Other Studies, but now the portrait was to take three volumes, as Scholastic Humanism and the Unification of Europe (the first volume appeared in 1995 and the second in 1999). This depicts Europe's universities from their beginnings, in the landscape that nurtured them and which they in turn shaped, as the inquiring, intellectually inventive element in a society otherwise authoritarian and hierarchical. Southern received many honorary degrees and other marks of distinction. He was knighted in 1974. In 1987, the Oxford modern history faculty was asked to enter a name (without its owner's knowledge) for an international prize offered that year by the Fondazione Internazionale Balzan for the \"greatest historian of medieval Europe\". The judges chose Southern. On receiving his prize of \u00a3100,000, the astonished winner at once handed it over to St Hilda's College, to start a fund for a medieval fellowship to be named after his own tutor, Galbraith. It was typical of his character. What of his historical writing? Southern once wrote: \"The first duty of the historian is to produce works of art. By this I do not primarily mean works that are finely written, but works which are emotionally and intellectually satisfying, that combine a clear unity of conception with a vivacity of detail, and portray people whose actions are intelligible within the framework of their circumstances and character.\" That describes his own work, which happily remains, to be read and re-read. He is survived by his wife Sheila and sons Andrew and Peter.",

      "body": "<p>The future of league football in Hull, the seventh largest city in England, was thrown into doubt yesterday when the city's financially stricken football club called in the administrators. </p> <p>Kroll Buchler Phillips, a leading corporate recovery and financial restructuring group, was appointed administrator after the high court granted a 14-day stay of a winding up order brought by customs and excise and the inland revenue for payment of outstanding taxes of \u00a3500,000. The club's total debt is thought to be as much as \u00a32m. </p> <p>Yesterday's legal moves demonstrate the reality of life for lower league clubs whose hand to mouth existence is a world away from the glamour and wealth of the Premiership. Any white knight attempting to ride to the Tigers' rescue would need between \u00a32m and \u00a33m - less than David Beckham earns in a year - to guarantee the 97-year-old club's financial future. </p> <p>The moves come a day after David Lloyd, the former chairman and still owner of the club's Boothferry Park ground, ordered bailiffs to lock out Hull's staff and players until he has been paid \u00a345,000 in outstanding rent. </p> <p>The players have not been paid for five weeks and, should they not receive their wages before the weekend, will be free to leave the club on Saturday. This would be a devastating blow - they are Hull City's only assets. </p> <p>The club's collapse has been played out against a background of bitterness and recrimination and inquiries into the running of the club by Humberside police fraud squad, the Department of Trade and the Football Association. </p> <p>In October 1998 Mr Lloyd sold the club, then no more than \u00a3100,000 in debt, to Sheffield businessman Nick Buchanan for \u00a380,000, but retained ownership of Boothferry Park. Mr Buchanan resigned yesterday, saying: \"I've fought and tried and fought and tried again to turn this club around but decided it's better if someone else has a go.\" </p> <p>Today the club's total liability is thought to be almost \u00a32m, run up in a 27-month period during which it has stayed rooted in the third divison and received more than \u00a31m in transfer fees, grants and loans and a share of a TV deal. Mr Buchanan yesterday said the losses were a result of increased investment in players and higher wages. </p> <p>Humberside police are investigating allegations of financial irregularities follow-ing a 15-month inquiry by the FA, begun after Mr Buchanan took control.

      "bodyText": "The future of league football in Hull, the seventh largest city in England, was thrown into doubt yesterday when the city's financially stricken football club called in the administrators. Kroll Buchler Phillips, a leading corporate recovery and financial restructuring group, was appointed administrator after the high court granted a 14-day stay of a winding up order brought by customs and excise and the inland revenue for payment of outstanding taxes of \u00a3500,000. The club's total debt is thought to be as much as \u00a32m. Yesterday's legal moves demonstrate the reality of life for lower league clubs whose hand to mouth existence is a world away from the glamour and wealth of the Premiership. Any white knight attempting to ride to the Tigers' rescue would need between \u00a32m and \u00a33m - less than David Beckham earns in a year - to guarantee the 97-year-old club's financial future. The moves come a day after David Lloyd, the former chairman and still owner of the club's Boothferry Park ground, ordered bailiffs to lock out Hull's staff and players until he has been paid \u00a345,000 in outstanding rent. The players have not been paid for five weeks and, should they not receive their wages before the weekend, will be free to leave the club on Saturday. This would be a devastating blow - they are Hull City's only assets. The club's collapse has been played out against a background of bitterness and recrimination and inquiries into the running of the club by Humberside police fraud squad, the Department of Trade and the Football Association. In October 1998 Mr Lloyd sold the club, then no more than \u00a3100,000 in debt, to Sheffield businessman Nick Buchanan for \u00a380,000, but retained ownership of Boothferry Park. Mr Buchanan resigned yesterday, saying: \"I've fought and tried and fought and tried again to turn this club around but decided it's better if someone else has a go.\" Today the club's total liability is thought to be almost \u00a32m, run up in a 27-month period during which it has stayed rooted in the third divison and received more than \u00a31m in transfer fees, grants and loans and a share of a TV deal. Mr Buchanan yesterday said the losses were a result of increased investment in players and higher wages. Humberside police are investigating allegations of financial irregularities follow-ing a 15-month inquiry by the FA, begun after Mr Buchanan took control. Areas the police are looking at are understood to include: \u0095 The purchase of an \u00a380,000 coach shortly after a loan from the players union, the PFA, towards wages was received. \u0095 Accounts purporting to show continuing payments to a former employee who left the club three years ago. He has been interviewed by the police and yesterday said he had not received any money since he left Hull City. \u0095 Allegations of impropriety in the administration of the club's youth development fund which was supported by Sport England and the FA. In 1998 and 1999 the two bodies paid a total of \u00a3276,000 into the fund, but withheld a further \u00a3138,000 in April last year following the FA investigation. \u0095 A dispute over an unpaid bill of \u00a36,000 at Mr Chu's Chinese restaurant, a favourite of local MP John Prescott. The club is counter-suing the restaurant alleging non-payment of bills for advertising hoardings. Mr Buchanan said he was aware of the police inquiry and insisted he was not its focus. \"I have absolutely nothing to hide,\" he said. He said he was the victim of a \"vendetta\" by a former director and that an investigation by accountants Deloitte &amp; Touche had found nothing untoward. Mr Buchanan said the purchase of the coach had been cleared by the board, denied any impropriety with the youth fund and said he was not aware of unusual payments being made. \"I've put an awful lot of money into this club, taken nothing out and received a bucket load of heartache in return,\" he said. Hull is the largest city in England never to have boasted a top-flight football team, and uncertainty over the future is holding back ambitious plans by the local authority, among the richest in the country thanks to the multi-million pound windfall from the privatisation of Kingston Communications. The council wants to build a \u00a3343m, 25,000-seater stadium which the Tigers would share with Hull rugby league club which competes in the Super League. John Topliss, of Kingston-upon-Hull council, said: \"What's happening with the football club places it [the stadium] in jeopardy, certainly.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>When the United States disapproves of a foreign government's actions, policies or ideology, it usually pursues one of three options. It bombs, it punishes, or it persuades. Sometimes it does all three together.</p> <p>Since America's military, economic and diplomatic might is unrivalled, its friends and allies tend, on the whole, to go along with its chosen course of action while America's foes tend to keep out of the way.</p> <p>Concerted American armed action of the kind seen in Iraq and Serbia is relatively rare and is usually embarked upon as a last resort. If persuasion fails and coercion of a foreign power or dictator is required, the much more usual, preferred tool is punishment by economic and diplomatic means - in other words, sanctions.</p> <p>Both the US presidency and the US Congress have given themselves sweeping powers to impose sanctions on foreigners who offend America's ideas of what is proper. These measures range from unilateral bans on selected exports or restrictions on entry into the US of \"undesirable\" individuals to full-scale trade, travel, investment and diplomatic embargoes.</p> <p>In such latter cases, the US will routinely ask the UN Security Council to endorse its actions, ensuring that other UN members follow its lead. Thanks to its enormous clout and its veto power, it usually gets its way.</p> <p>Iraq is the most notorious victim of all-out US-led punitive sanctions (even though the measures have been softened in recent years). Although most countries in the UN General Assembly no longer support the sanctions regime as applied to Baghdad, it remains in place regardless.</p> <p>But the US is not shy about taking matters into its own hands. At the present moment, an estimated 75 of the 190 or so nations of the world are subject to some form of US sanctions.</p> <p>Even more intriguingly, perhaps, almost half of all the unilateral economic sanctions imposed by the US since 1918 were levied from 1993 to 1998.</p> <p>In other words, in the post-Cold War period when the US finally attained unmatched global superpower status, it did not relax. Far from it. It began to throw its weight around to a greater degree than ever before.</p> <p>With the Soviet Union vanquished, Europe weak and divided, and China still far from representing a real challenge, the US apparently decided, almost subconsciously, to start running the world its own way - and was quick to use sanctions to punish those who disagreed or upset its plans.</p> <p>Oddly enough, during this same period there was a rising chorus of complaint within America that it was being expected to do too much. This gave rise to, or was the product of a new unilateralist or neo-isolationist mood. In fact, there is no contradiction. Sanctions were seen as a handy, hands-off way of controlling other people's behaviour without getting directly involved in solving the problem.</p> <p>The figures on sanctions, provided by US business lobby groups, also form the context for one of the more unexpected initiatives of the new Bush administration. When Colin Powell visited the Senate last month for hearings on his nomination as secretary of state, one of the issues he raised was sanctions.</p> <p>There were too many of them, he said, they often did not work, and what was more, they gave America a bad name. The repeated use of sanctions as a foreign policy weapon \"shows a degree of American hubris and arrogance that may not serve our interests all that well.\"</p> <p>Mr Powell, formerly of the Pentagon, is not one to shirk military action if it is deemed unavoidable. Yet he is also known vastly to prefer persuasion and negotiated solutions if at all possible. So what he appears to have been telling Congress is that the middle option for achieving US objectives - punishment and coercion - has been overdone in the past and must be used much more sparingly in future.</p> <p>Does this presage a new dawn of enlightenment, a new beginning for the embargoed and sanctioned citizenry and governments of Havana, Delhi, Damascus, Tehran, Kabul, Beijing and elsewhere? That is far from clear.</p> <p>The ending of destructive and outdated US measures targeted at Fidel Castro's Cuba, for example, is long overdue.

      "bodyText": "When the United States disapproves of a foreign government's actions, policies or ideology, it usually pursues one of three options. It bombs, it punishes, or it persuades. Sometimes it does all three together. Since America's military, economic and diplomatic might is unrivalled, its friends and allies tend, on the whole, to go along with its chosen course of action while America's foes tend to keep out of the way. Concerted American armed action of the kind seen in Iraq and Serbia is relatively rare and is usually embarked upon as a last resort. If persuasion fails and coercion of a foreign power or dictator is required, the much more usual, preferred tool is punishment by economic and diplomatic means - in other words, sanctions. Both the US presidency and the US Congress have given themselves sweeping powers to impose sanctions on foreigners who offend America's ideas of what is proper. These measures range from unilateral bans on selected exports or restrictions on entry into the US of \"undesirable\" individuals to full-scale trade, travel, investment and diplomatic embargoes. In such latter cases, the US will routinely ask the UN Security Council to endorse its actions, ensuring that other UN members follow its lead. Thanks to its enormous clout and its veto power, it usually gets its way. Iraq is the most notorious victim of all-out US-led punitive sanctions (even though the measures have been softened in recent years). Although most countries in the UN General Assembly no longer support the sanctions regime as applied to Baghdad, it remains in place regardless. But the US is not shy about taking matters into its own hands. At the present moment, an estimated 75 of the 190 or so nations of the world are subject to some form of US sanctions. Even more intriguingly, perhaps, almost half of all the unilateral economic sanctions imposed by the US since 1918 were levied from 1993 to 1998. In other words, in the post-Cold War period when the US finally attained unmatched global superpower status, it did not relax. Far from it. It began to throw its weight around to a greater degree than ever before. With the Soviet Union vanquished, Europe weak and divided, and China still far from representing a real challenge, the US apparently decided, almost subconsciously, to start running the world its own way - and was quick to use sanctions to punish those who disagreed or upset its plans. Oddly enough, during this same period there was a rising chorus of complaint within America that it was being expected to do too much. This gave rise to, or was the product of a new unilateralist or neo-isolationist mood. In fact, there is no contradiction. Sanctions were seen as a handy, hands-off way of controlling other people's behaviour without getting directly involved in solving the problem. The figures on sanctions, provided by US business lobby groups, also form the context for one of the more unexpected initiatives of the new Bush administration. When Colin Powell visited the Senate last month for hearings on his nomination as secretary of state, one of the issues he raised was sanctions. There were too many of them, he said, they often did not work, and what was more, they gave America a bad name. The repeated use of sanctions as a foreign policy weapon \"shows a degree of American hubris and arrogance that may not serve our interests all that well.\" Mr Powell, formerly of the Pentagon, is not one to shirk military action if it is deemed unavoidable. Yet he is also known vastly to prefer persuasion and negotiated solutions if at all possible. So what he appears to have been telling Congress is that the middle option for achieving US objectives - punishment and coercion - has been overdone in the past and must be used much more sparingly in future. Does this presage a new dawn of enlightenment, a new beginning for the embargoed and sanctioned citizenry and governments of Havana, Delhi, Damascus, Tehran, Kabul, Beijing and elsewhere? That is far from clear. The ending of destructive and outdated US measures targeted at Fidel Castro's Cuba, for example, is long overdue. But that is probably politically impossible for a Republican administration. Moves to end the sanctions imposed on India in 1998 over its nuclear tests, on the other hand, now look quite likely. Mr Powell has been explicit about two cases: Iraq and Libya. Here the sanctions would remain. What he has been not quite so forthcoming about is the slightly less noble Republican motivation, fuelled by powerful business interests, to curtail sanctions that hurt US business and trade. One lobby group estimates that the US may lose up to $19bn a year in exports as a result of its own sanctions. Before he became vice-president, for example, Dick Cheney's Texas oil company lobbied hard for an end to curbs on doing business in Iran. Companies linked to that run by Mr Cheney also did work in Libya and Iraq, despite the sanctions. It is clear that behind Mr Powell's wish to use sanctions more intelligently and sparingly and his concerns about America's reputation abroad, lie some very hard-headed and pragmatic calculations about money. And there is another consideration that gives pause. Sanctions are not always bad and they do sometimes work: the example of South Africa during the apartheid era is often given. And it will be remembered that many big businesses, including some British banks, fervently opposed them. The recently imposed UN curbs on the West African war-stoking trade in \"blood diamonds\" provide another example of sanctions that are morally desirable and will, hopefully, work. Many feel, on the other hand, that Russian abuses of human rights in Chechnya should be the subject of international sanctions. That they are not is due in part to the US refusal to act. Having led the way in using sanctions to punish international bad behaviour when it suited its purposes, the US now seems to be in danger of swinging too far in the other direction, again for self-interested reasons.

The joint may be jumping with johnnies, but what effect has that had on the perils they are designed to prevent? Does the condom culture, so central to the promotion of safe sex, have quite the force it did when it emerged in the early 80s in response to Aids? </p> <p>The signs are not encouraging. For example, if the new ubiquity of the everyman of contraception has had a limiting effect on rates of teenage pregnancies it hasn't been enough to knock the UK off the top of the European league. Moreover, the latest data on HIV infection and other sexually transmitted infections [STIs] make it tempting to conclude that condom use is going radically out of style. Figures from the public health laboratory service (PHLS) for last year showed 2,868 new HIV diagnoses, with more likely to be added as information continues coming in. This represents a 7% rise on 1999 - which was itself a 10-year high. Other STIs are also being diagnosed in larger numbers. At the end of last year the PHLS also reported big rises since 1995 in diagnoses of genital warts (up 20%), syphilis (up 54%), gonorrhoea (up 55%) and, most spectacularly, genital chlamydia (up 76%). </p> <p>This data should be handled with appropriate care. Chlamydia was almost unknown to the general public until a few years ago, but has been vigorously targeted by providers of sexual health services and information - hence the huge rise in its diagnosis figure may partly reflect increased amounts of testing. </p> <p>Similarly, many of the new HIV diagnoses have been of people who were infected some years ago but have only recently come forward for testing, perhaps encouraged in some cases by the emergence of drug treatments which slow the development of the virus. None the less the PHLS view is that \"the rises in acute STIs are likely to be associated with increasing unsafe sexual behaviour particularly among young heterosexuals and gay men\". </p> <p>The basic prevention message remains the same: use a condom. So why does rejection of them appear to be strengthening, especially among certain social groups? </p> <p>Again, there is a need for circumspection. For example, Will Nutland, a health promotion manager at Terrence Higgins Trust Lighthouse, cites research showing that while there is some evidence that gay men are having more unprotected analintercourse, there is also evidence that many of those who do so are aware of their own and their sexual partners' HIV status and proceeding accordingly: if both partners are HIV positive, a condom becomes redundant, as it does if both are free from the virus. </p> <p>But while this shows that the connection between condom use and the incidence of infection is not straightforward in all respects, no one doubts that the safe sex message in general is at least as important as ever, or that the virtues of the condom must remain integral to it. As Nutland points out, one effect of more successful HIV treatment has been to enlarge the pool of people surviving with the virus and therefore representing a possible source of infection. And Gwenda Hughes, a senior scientist at the communicable disease surveillance centre in Colindale, stresses that the increased diagnoses of syphilis and gonorrhoea seem very directly connected to unsafe sex practices. Hughes also emphasises the invisibility of chlamydia - \"70% of cases show no symptoms\" - and the very serious consequences it can have for women: infertility, ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain. </p> <p>As ever, it is the young who are at the greatest risk from STIs, especially girls and young women in their late teens, and men in their early to mid-20s. So how can the young be taught to love the condom more? It may not be easy. Nutland is frank in saying that those brave 80s efforts to promote condoms as sexy were doomed to have a limited effect: \"In the real world most people just don't think they're sexy at all.\" From another perspective Greg Falola, a Merseyside youth worker specialising in male sexual health and behaviour, says that a lot of those he works with are put off by the bog-standard models they can get for free, and put off by the price of more exotic varieties: \"It means they never get to use a condom that they like.\" </p> <p>Behind such practical realities lies a deeper problem too: the connections between certain styles of heterosexual masculinity, social disadvantage and the allure of risk. In one of his projects Falola asked a group of Wirral lads to tell him the things that make a man manly. They listed big money, a big car, and getting lots of notches on their bedposts. Of these, only the last is ever likely to be theirs. As Falola observes: \"To them being manly means being big and brave and taking risks. It isn't hard to see how that kind of thinking transfers into their attitudes to condoms and safe sex.\"</p>",

As many as 5,000 people in Britain need a \"clotting factor\" (made from blood plasma) to treat the painful, excessive bleeding that swells their muscles as a result of haemophilia. Imagine finding out that these products were made from contaminated blood. </p> <p>And it is no wonder adult haemophiliacs in England are demanding the same \"safer\" synthetic alternative (known as recombinant) that is on offer to child sufferers throughout Britain, and to older patients in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. You might think any government, having seen the effects of two previous mistakes involving tainted blood supplies, would be keen to cough up the extra cash for such treatment. </p> <p>But not a bit of it. Ministers, under pressure from the Haemophilia Society's campaign for recombinant and a public inquiry into the overall safety of blood products, appear more worried about the effect \"sensationalist\" press coverage would have in further distressing patients. </p> <p>Decisions on providing recombinant should be made on clinical grounds, not on whether a fuss is made.

      "bodyText": "The NHS has accidentally infected 4,800 British haemophiliacs with the hepatitis C virus. Of these, 1,200 have also been infected with HIV; a third of them remain alive. Now there is a theoretical risk that the NHS has infected some of these people with the human form of BSE, the fatal variant CJD. No wonder many haemophiliacs are angry. As many as 5,000 people in Britain need a \"clotting factor\" (made from blood plasma) to treat the painful, excessive bleeding that swells their muscles as a result of haemophilia. Imagine finding out that these products were made from contaminated blood. And it is no wonder adult haemophiliacs in England are demanding the same \"safer\" synthetic alternative (known as recombinant) that is on offer to child sufferers throughout Britain, and to older patients in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. You might think any government, having seen the effects of two previous mistakes involving tainted blood supplies, would be keen to cough up the extra cash for such treatment. But not a bit of it. Ministers, under pressure from the Haemophilia Society's campaign for recombinant and a public inquiry into the overall safety of blood products, appear more worried about the effect \"sensationalist\" press coverage would have in further distressing patients. Decisions on providing recombinant should be made on clinical grounds, not on whether a fuss is made. Haemophilia doctors say recombinant should be on offer, although British-sourced products, which might carry vCJD infection from donors, were replaced by US plasma in 1998.

      "body": "<p>Last October, David Lee, a retired engineer from Hampshire, went into the Royal Brompton Hospital for a heart bypass operation. It was a striking success. Normally bypass patients take six to eight weeks to recuperate: within a fortnight, the 63-year-old had resumed his regular three-mile morning walk. </p> <p>It wasn't just Lee's rapid recovery that was exceptional. The surgeon in charge of the operation, Anthony De Souza, sat several feet away from him during the procedure. The arms that delved into the patient's body were not his. Instead, they were made of metal, and bolted to the table. </p> <p>Lee was one of the first people in Britain to be operated on by a robot that is capable of carrying out the most delicate aspects of the surgeon's art in the confined space of the chest cavity, and with the minimum of damage to the chest itself. </p> <p>The robots are expensive - around three-quarters of a million pounds each - and rare. There are just two in Britain, and only a few dozen in the whole world. But for heart bypass patients, they offer a huge advantage. </p> <p>About 30,000 bypass operations take place in Britain each year, a number the government wants doubled. The procedure is actually a series of operations: first, veins or arteries are snipped out from other parts of the patient to replace the failing coronary arteries, blocked by fatty deposits or blood clots. </p> <p>The surgeon then takes an electric saw, cuts down the middle of the patient's breastbone, and opens up the ribcage like the lid of a box. A cold potassium solution is injected into the heart to stop it, and the business of pumping and oxygenating the patient's blood is taken over by a heart-lung machine while surgeons graft in the good vessels. </p> <p>When this is finished, the heart is restarted, the inside of the patient cleaned up - anticoagulants administered to keep the blood flowing freely make the inside of the chest a messy place - and the breastbone is wired back together. Given the radical nature of such a procedure, it is extraordinary how routine it has become: it is the most commonly performed heart operation in Britain. </p> <p>A bypass literally rejuvenates its beneficiaries. But there are drawbacks. The opening and resealing of the chest means a long, often painful recovery period, and in a minority of patients, the use of the heart-lung machine leaves behind tiny bubbles and particles in the bloodstream. These can diminish the person's ability to carry out certain mental tasks, such as maths problems. </p> <p>So two solutions were needed: a technique to avoid opening up the chest, and a way to avoid using the heart-lung machine. In the 70s, doctors in Latin America solved the second problem. Faced with the impossibly high cost of heart-lung machines, they developed a way of operating on a still beating heart. The device they used, called a stabiliser, immobilised only the small section of the heart being worked on. </p> <p>And now, with the robot, the first problem has been solved. For a few lucky patients, there is no need to bisect the breastbone. Instead, the two arms of the robot slip in between the ribcage through holes that are smaller than a five-pence piece. </p> <p>Six holes were made in David Lee - two for the robot arms, one for the camera and light, two for drainage and one for the stabiliser. The word \"riddled\" comes to mind, but each hole was an easily healed incision. </p> <p>\"I've been left with just small scars,\" Lee says. \"I had very little pain when I woke up, and I'd recommend the operation to anyone. It makes such a difference to your life.\" </p> <p>De Souza, who is pioneering the use of surgical robots in Britain with fellow Royal Brompton consultant John Pepper, says: \"The fewer holes the better. But they heal so well that you shouldn't think about jeopardising the outcome by using too few of them.\" </p> <p>Although the surgeons are as comfortable with the word as the media, \"robot\" is a misnomer. The machine is really a slave, following the movements made by the surgeon sitting in another part of the operating theatre, and translating movements of centimetres into fractions of millimetres. </p> <p>Zeus, the make of robot at the Brompton, is an easy workmate. When off-duty, it sits quietly in a small, shabby room. It doesn't draw a salary, never uncorks a bottle of wine, always stays on the hospital premises and, though it has a voice - an American female one - has never been known to criticise a colleague. </p> <p>The set-up is in three parts: the operating table, with the robot arms and camera attached; the separate computer brain of the system; and the workstation where the surgeon sits. At first the human surgeons watched what they were making the robot do through eyepieces that gave a three-dimensional view, but now they use a conventional flat screen. </p> <p>Sitting at the workstation, the surgeon holds a control in each hand, tweezer-like instruments that are attached to rods which transmit movement through all axes to the robot. </p> <p>Staff have set up a practice system for surgeons to hone their robot suturing skills. A cardboard box stands in for the chest cavity; the robot arms and camera plunge inside through holes. For muscle and artery, there is a rubber glove, stretched taut and marked with lines of dots where the stitches are supposed to go. </p> <p>De Souza pops in a couple of stitches, and invites me to have a go. I sit down and grasp the tweezers. On screen I can see a pair of metal pincers, a needle and thread, and the line of dots. Everything looks huge, but the pincers are only a couple of centimetres long. I engage the system by pushing on a treadle with my foot. Press the tweezers, and the pincers open; move and twist them, and the robot obediently follows. I attempt to stitch. I gouge a hole, then lose the needle. In a real operation, I would be wrestled to the ground and taken into custody, but for a trained surgeon, the system is easy to pick up - as the rows of neat stitching in other practice gloves testify. </p> <p>The robot surgeon was commissioned by the US department of defence for use in remote field hospitals. However, its use in the US is still restricted by the food and drug administration. Europe has been the test-bed - so far, apparently, with success. </p> <p>In bypass operations, the robot can only deal with the replacement of a single artery - the critical left anterior descending artery. The average number of arteries replaced is three, and single-artery problems are often dealt with by other, temporary means, such as a balloon inflated at the blockage site - a process known as angioplasty. But De Souza says some surgeons are arguing that single-artery bypasses should be performed more often. </p> <p>One of the drawbacks of the robot is that the human surgeon cannot feel the yield and texture of the tissues being cut, sewn or probed. The team working with Britain's second surgical robot, at St Mary's hospital and Imperial College in London, are trying to devise just such a feedback mechanism. </p> <p>St Mary's has been using the robot, known as da Vinci, for bowel operations and plans to carry out its first heart bypass later this year.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> Painful pull</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Q: I've pulled a muscle in my right thigh (while skiing). It runs from behind my knee to about threequarters the way up the inside of my thigh. A week after pulling it, I have black and yellow bruising all along the line of the muscle and it still hurts, especially when I sit. What's the best thing to do to make it better? And could the bruising mean it's more serious than I think? </strong></p> <p>A: You can get a tremendous amount of bruising after tearing some fibres of a large muscle like the one that runs up the back of your thigh (which makes up part of your hamstrings). It is highly unlikely to signify any more serious underlying problem. Arnica tablets and cream are great favourites for \"bringing out the bruise\" but probably make not the slightest difference. When it aches, elevate your leg and put a cold compress (eg a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a pillowcase) under the bruised area. </p> <p>As the muscle fibres heal, they will shorten so it's all too easy to sustain a similar injury again. The trick is to gradually stretch up the damaged fibres. This means gentle hamstring stretches (ie bending down to touch your toes), starting at a few a day (stop if it hurts) and building up until you have full stretch back. If you belong to a gym, you can use the hamstring- stretching machine with a light weight to further build up the strength. </p> <p><strong> Troublesome tear </strong></p> <p><strong> Q: I have an excruciatingly painful and embarrassing problem. A tear in my anus means that passing a motion is almost unbearably painful and that I pass blood with my stool sometimes. I have been told I have an anal fissure and am on a waiting list to have my anus stretched - a prospect that fills me with consternation. Are there any other treatments I could try? </strong></p> <p>A: Anal fissures are horrible, extremely common and potentially treatable without recourse to surgery. The fissure is a small tear in the lining of the anal canal which sometimes develops after passing particularly hard stools. The sphincter that keeps us faecally continent goes into spasm and this can result in a long-term fissure, a skin tag that hangs down outside your anus and an abnormally tight anal opening. Most fissures heal on their own. It makes sense to avoid constipation by eating a high- fibre diet with plenty of fluids and soften the stool using laxatives or suppositories. </p> <p>If you are still suffering after six weeks, you may need further treatment. Traditionally, the surgical options have been an anal stretch to loosen the tightened anus, or cutting part of the sphincter for a more long- lasting effect. The problem with the latter is that it can make you faceally incontinent. </p> <p>Effective treatment is available now in the form of GTN ointment (0.2%) rubbed on to the anus. The active ingredient is the same drug that is used to treat angina. Happily, it relaxes the anal sphincter in the same way as it eases pressure on the heart and allows the fissure to heal. It needs to be specially made up by a pharmacist as it is not yet licenced for use in anal fissures. GTN can give you a whopping headache and you can't take Viagra with it as it is dangerous for the heart. You should see a specialist if bleeding continues to rule out bowel cancer. </p> <p><strong> Nail nightmare </strong> </p> <p><strong> Q: I've had a recurrent problem with an ingrowing toenail. It flares up occasionally, oozing pus from the corner and becoming very red and painful. I usually get away with an antiseptic cream and cotton wool but attacks are becoming more frequent and lasting longer. Can you help? </strong></p> <p>A: Ingrown nails may be caused by improper trimming, inherited nail deformities, injuries, fungal infections, or pressure. The big toe is the commonest victim.If the toe is infected, you might see pus or redness.You need to see a podiatrist (previously known as a chiropodist). If the nail is not infected, you may get away with having the corner of the nail trimmed to relieve the pain. For a partially ingrown nail, your podiatrist may need to remove one side of your nail back to the cuticle and treat the base. Severe infections or totally ingrown nails may require antibiotics and temporary or permanent removal of the entire nail. Before you faint at the thought of this medieval-style torture, rest assured that heavy duty volumes of local anaesthetic are used to numb the pain. </p> <p> <strong> Perturbed by a patch </strong></p> <p><strong> Q: I've a brownish patch that has appeared on my cheek since I've been pregnant. My baby is due in a few weeks time and I am getting a little concerned about the patch though my GP assured me it's not skin cancer. Will it go on its own or do I need to do something? </strong></p> <p>A: You've probably got chloasma, also known as melasma or \"mask of pregnancy\". In fact, you don't need to be a pregnant woman to get one, though it helps. It appears on the forehead, cheeks or lips. It is thought to be a reaction to hormones, hence its appearance while pregnant, on the pill or while using depot provera contraceptive injections. The patch of pigment tends to get darker in the sun. It usually fades a few months after delivery but can recur, and be darker, in future pregnancies. Men who use aftershave and then go out in the sun may also develop a similar patch of mottled pigmentation. This is called a phototoxic reaction and is due to ultraviolet radiation being absorbed by the chemical substance (perfume, cologne and other types of fragrance) on the skin. </p> <p>Best advice for chloasma is to consider coming off the pill, use sunblock, avoid strong soaps, facial cleansers or aftershave and discuss with a dermatologist using bleaching creams that contain hydroquinone or other creams to decrease skin pigmentation. Camouflage creams are also available if you feel very self-conscious. </p> <p> <strong> Cancer choices </strong></p> <p><strong> Q: I have breast cancer, recently diagnosed. I am trying to find out as much as possible so I can make informed choices about my treatment. I am finding that I am overwhelmed by the information available on the internet and can't see the wood for the trees. Can you recommend any reliable source of information? </strong></p> <p>A: You are so right to inform yourself as fully as possible. Of all the sites I've checked out, I think the one run by CancerBACUP is the best - <a href=\"http://www.cancerbacup.org.uk.\">www.cancerbacup.org.uk.</a> A full discussion with a member of your breast care team, followed by a second opinion if you feel you need it, should also help to clarify your thoughts. Good luck!</p>",

      "bodyText": "Painful pull Q: I've pulled a muscle in my right thigh (while skiing). It runs from behind my knee to about threequarters the way up the inside of my thigh. A week after pulling it, I have black and yellow bruising all along the line of the muscle and it still hurts, especially when I sit. What's the best thing to do to make it better? And could the bruising mean it's more serious than I think? A: You can get a tremendous amount of bruising after tearing some fibres of a large muscle like the one that runs up the back of your thigh (which makes up part of your hamstrings). It is highly unlikely to signify any more serious underlying problem. Arnica tablets and cream are great favourites for \"bringing out the bruise\" but probably make not the slightest difference. When it aches, elevate your leg and put a cold compress (eg a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a pillowcase) under the bruised area. As the muscle fibres heal, they will shorten so it's all too easy to sustain a similar injury again. The trick is to gradually stretch up the damaged fibres. This means gentle hamstring stretches (ie bending down to touch your toes), starting at a few a day (stop if it hurts) and building up until you have full stretch back. If you belong to a gym, you can use the hamstring- stretching machine with a light weight to further build up the strength. Troublesome tear Q: I have an excruciatingly painful and embarrassing problem. A tear in my anus means that passing a motion is almost unbearably painful and that I pass blood with my stool sometimes. I have been told I have an anal fissure and am on a waiting list to have my anus stretched - a prospect that fills me with consternation. Are there any other treatments I could try? A: Anal fissures are horrible, extremely common and potentially treatable without recourse to surgery. The fissure is a small tear in the lining of the anal canal which sometimes develops after passing particularly hard stools. The sphincter that keeps us faecally continent goes into spasm and this can result in a long-term fissure, a skin tag that hangs down outside your anus and an abnormally tight anal opening. Most fissures heal on their own. It makes sense to avoid constipation by eating a high- fibre diet with plenty of fluids and soften the stool using laxatives or suppositories. If you are still suffering after six weeks, you may need further treatment. Traditionally, the surgical options have been an anal stretch to loosen the tightened anus, or cutting part of the sphincter for a more long- lasting effect. The problem with the latter is that it can make you faceally incontinent. Effective treatment is available now in the form of GTN ointment (0.2%) rubbed on to the anus. The active ingredient is the same drug that is used to treat angina. Happily, it relaxes the anal sphincter in the same way as it eases pressure on the heart and allows the fissure to heal. It needs to be specially made up by a pharmacist as it is not yet licenced for use in anal fissures. GTN can give you a whopping headache and you can't take Viagra with it as it is dangerous for the heart. You should see a specialist if bleeding continues to rule out bowel cancer. Nail nightmare Q: I've had a recurrent problem with an ingrowing toenail. It flares up occasionally, oozing pus from the corner and becoming very red and painful. I usually get away with an antiseptic cream and cotton wool but attacks are becoming more frequent and lasting longer. Can you help? A: Ingrown nails may be caused by improper trimming, inherited nail deformities, injuries, fungal infections, or pressure. The big toe is the commonest victim.If the toe is infected, you might see pus or redness.You need to see a podiatrist (previously known as a chiropodist). If the nail is not infected, you may get away with having the corner of the nail trimmed to relieve the pain. For a partially ingrown nail, your podiatrist may need to remove one side of your nail back to the cuticle and treat the base. Severe infections or totally ingrown nails may require antibiotics and temporary or permanent removal of the entire nail. Before you faint at the thought of this medieval-style torture, rest assured that heavy duty volumes of local anaesthetic are used to numb the pain. Perturbed by a patch Q: I've a brownish patch that has appeared on my cheek since I've been pregnant. My baby is due in a few weeks time and I am getting a little concerned about the patch though my GP assured me it's not skin cancer. Will it go on its own or do I need to do something? A: You've probably got chloasma, also known as melasma or \"mask of pregnancy\". In fact, you don't need to be a pregnant woman to get one, though it helps. It appears on the forehead, cheeks or lips. It is thought to be a reaction to hormones, hence its appearance while pregnant, on the pill or while using depot provera contraceptive injections. The patch of pigment tends to get darker in the sun. It usually fades a few months after delivery but can recur, and be darker, in future pregnancies. Men who use aftershave and then go out in the sun may also develop a similar patch of mottled pigmentation. This is called a phototoxic reaction and is due to ultraviolet radiation being absorbed by the chemical substance (perfume, cologne and other types of fragrance) on the skin. Best advice for chloasma is to consider coming off the pill, use sunblock, avoid strong soaps, facial cleansers or aftershave and discuss with a dermatologist using bleaching creams that contain hydroquinone or other creams to decrease skin pigmentation. Camouflage creams are also available if you feel very self-conscious. Cancer choices Q: I have breast cancer, recently diagnosed. I am trying to find out as much as possible so I can make informed choices about my treatment. I am finding that I am overwhelmed by the information available on the internet and can't see the wood for the trees. Can you recommend any reliable source of information? A: You are so right to inform yourself as fully as possible. Of all the sites I've checked out, I think the one run by CancerBACUP is the best - www.cancerbacup.org.uk. A full discussion with a member of your breast care team, followed by a second opinion if you feel you need it, should also help to clarify your thoughts. Good luck!",

      "bodyText": "William Hague and other key members of the Conservative party are actively courting faith groups. It began last year with the launch of the party's new social policy initiative, Renewing One Nation, and has continued through addresses to religious-based charities, letters to the press and, most recently, at a speech at the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) annual conference. The word compassion, which has traditionally been associated with faith-inspired caring and charity, recurs in these public statements: voluntary groups are creators of \"compassionate communities\"; \"compassion means more than a handout\"; the party stands for \"compassionate Conservatism\" and it aims to \"denationalise compassion\". How should churches and religious-based welfare organisations respond to such invitations to get more involved in solving social problems? Are they being offered a golden opportunity to renew and develop their traditional role in helping the poor and needy or should they be wary? Like secular voluntary and charitable organisations, faith-based groups need to be aware that governmental funding invariably comes with strings attached. The strings may be ones that they are prepared to accept (conforming to monitoring systems and best-value regimes, for example, or favouring particular kinds of users). All the same, the practical implications of accepting governmental funding need to be considered carefully by the leaders and trustees of faith groups, especially as such funding may restrict their ability to favour their own adherents and traditional beneficiaries or to respond to them in informal and unregulated ways. But beyond this kind of pragmatic consideration, leaders of faith groups may also want to reflect on the transatlantic sources of the ideas being promulgated by the Conservatives in this country. One such source is the US radical right and its analysis of the causes of social problems. It emphasises personal and individual responsibility for not only the occurrence of social problems such as poverty, homelessness and many forms of ill-health, but also for their solution. The corollary is an approach to people such as single mothers, drug addicts and those without adequate housing which severely limits the state benefits they can receive during their lifetime. This attitude is aimed at discouraging what is seen as anti-social behaviour and encouraging self help. A second influential strand of American thinking is related to the first, but is not necessarily identical to it. It is the religious right's viewpoint that was embraced by US president George Bush long before he took office and which is encapsulated in a book entitled Compassionate Conservatism by Marvin Olasky. In addition to the now standard argument of the political right that big government and state welfare should be severely curtailed, Mr Olasky argues that faith-based organisations are more effective than other kinds of organisations in solving social problems and that they should therefore receive governmental funding, alongside equivalent secular organisations, to carry out their social welfare activities. In the US, governmental agencies can now legitimately fund faith-based groups and individual congregations even in cases where they discriminate in their employment practices in favour of their own adherents. This also applies even if the services they provide (for example, prison visiting, daycare or homeless shelters) are overtly linked to beneficiaries attending religious worship, listening to homilies or assenting to particular theological viewpoints on their sinful lifestyles. Faith groups will no doubt want to consider whether the philosophies underpinning the policies of the US radical right and religious right are commensurate with their own theologies of compassion and caring. Punitive, stigmatising and selective approaches to those in social distress do not necessarily sit comfortably with more liberal theologies, which tend to be universalistic, accepting and non-judgmental in their approach to social service provision.",

      "body": "<p>The ascendant young actress says she needs a cigarette. I know, she says, it's a terrible thing, and her publicist hands her one. Anything else? Yeah, she says, coffee would be great. So coffee it is. And then come the introductions, and she smiles her sunny smile from across the room, and says hello Dannyfromtheguardian. </p> <p>The ascendant young actress is called Kate Hudson - her face is all Californian glow and spry insouciance, and staring out from bus shelters across the country, on a movie poster that reads Almost Famous. Almost Famous, the title of the 70s-set rock music fable which, although cast in a supporting role, she effectively walks away with. And Almost Famous, a pithy summation of her current celebrity status. Until you realise that, two months shy of her 22nd birthday, \"almost\" is redundant. Anointed by the media as this year's It Girl, she's there already. </p> <p>Which the ascendant young actress isn't quite naive enough not to see through. \"Oh, it's obvious,\" she says when you ask why the world wants a piece of her. She means her family. Specifically, she means her parents; more specifically still, her mother. This, you see, is no mere identikit starlet. Rather, Kate Hudson is Hollywood blue-blood, film business aristocracy, raised by action hero stepfather Kurt Russell and - their resemblance genuinely startling - definitive ditz Goldie Hawn. \"The thing with my parents cuts both ways,\" she says, finally lighting her cigarette. \"I mean, if I suck, then maybe I'll never work again because of it. Either way, it brings a certain attention which honestly holds not much importance to me.\" </p> <p>But which holds a lot of importance to everyone else. Glance through her ever-thickening press file and, in a single sentence, you'll find reference to the symmetry between her part as a rock star's girlfriend in Almost Famous and real-life role as a rock star's wife (having recently married Chris Robinson, frontman of the Stones-esque Black Crowes), right before the revelation that she still lives with her parents. \"And it's like, no, strangely, as a married woman in my 20s, I have actually left home.\" She tilts her head and squints, as if to say her point's been made: \"D'you know what I mean?\" </p> <p>It's the problem with being all things to all people, I say, and she nods. So in one moment she's both this year's hottest blonde and the wide-eyed innocent who did something called \"the happy dance\" when she landed Almost Famous. \"Yeah, I hear that so much. It was one stupid comment. It was like Woo! I did the happy dance! D'you know?\" And, in the ardent column inches, you find another mirror to her breakthrough in Almost Famous. There, she's the ideal woman with whom the kid journalist at the film's centre falls hopelessly in love; here, she's the perfect face that journalists - at least male journalists - exhaust their thesauruses drooling over. </p> <p>Ask her if she knew the part was going to make her, and she drifts into the bromidic language of actors. Oh no, she says, all she cared about was making director Cameron Crowe happy and, anyway, in this business you never know how things will turn out, you just do the best you can. D'you know? She winces. \"I guess that sounds really boring.\" </p> <p>As if in apology, she talks at length about how she felt playing a groupie in the film's portrait of the baldly sexist 70s music industry. \"Um . . . well, a lot of women say it's degrading. But from the people I spoke to, they all knew what they were doing. They made that decision to follow that band, or to be with that man, and not one of them regretted it. And nor should they. Because some of the greatest songs ever written were about these women, right?\" She doesn't wait for a reply. \"But yes, there's also sadness there. It's like people who are constantly doing drugs. It's not necessarily about the drugs. It's about the problem. The core.\" </p> <p>So are drugs something she has experience of? Opinions about? \"I do. I have lots of opinions about drugs.\" And then she says that she's reading Tom Wolfe's Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, and that drugs should be used \"to enhance, not forget\", and that hard drugs (mentioned with a grimace) \"shouldn't be taken, period. I mean, me personally, I'm scared of drugs. But I believe they can be used in amazing ways. And I have absolutely no problem with marijuana.\" </p> <p>Does she smoke it? Is that what she's getting at? \"Well . . . I . . . ah . . .\" The seconds tick by. \"I don't have a problem with people smoking it. If people want to smoke pot, I say go ahead. I do have a problem with kids who think it's cool.\" </p> <p>Given her marriage to Robinson, a chalky divorc\u00e9 with a longstanding yen for legalising cannabis, it's risky ground for a tabloid-friendly figure like herself. Which may be why, with one eye on her publicist, she requests another cigarette and says, somewhat hurriedly: \"So that's what I think about pot. D'you know what I mean?\" </p> <p>Although they were only married in the new year, she knows the questions about her 34-year-old \"soulmate\" Robinson will come soon enough - most hedging, delicately or otherwise, around his role as a surrogate father: \"Which, of course, is ridiculous. I have a dad. Kurt's my dad.\" Yet two and two will surely be put together, particularly with Hudson's biological father Bill walking out on the family when his daughter was barely out of nappies (Russell moved in thereafter). Last autumn, the pair exchanged harsh, public words after Hudson Jr complained that her father \"doesn't know me from a hole in the wall\". Add in the curiosity surrounding her mother - largely devoted to who's bitterly envious of whom - and you can see why she might be sick of discussing her family. </p> <p>\"It's weird,\" she says. \"I'm not, because I love them, and I miss them, and I like to talk about them. But I don't like the mundane questions. Because it's always, is my mom jealous of me? which is something I get very offended by, or am I jealous of her? And these questions mean nothing. They're just mundane. Because the only answer is no, of course not. Or someone'll say, 'Oh, before you go to awards ceremonies, does your mother give you red carpet tips?' And you go, 'Who do you think we are?' My mother's a Buddhist, for Christ's sake. Who thinks we sit around with her giving me tips on walking down red carpets?\" </p> <p>It's unfortunate, I say, but you've both become symbols of Hollywood's ageing process. One day, for example, you'll no longer be referred to as Goldie Hawn's daughter, and she'll be nothing but Kate Hudson's mother. D'you know what I mean? \"Yeah, I see that. I mean, in other people's eyes. But it's so funny, because that's what we are. She's my mom, I'm her daughter, and we're damn proud of each other. We don't look at each other as actresses .\" </p> <p>She peers at her coffee, cold in the cup. \"But it's like . . . I've been burned so many times already. Misquoted so many times. But that will never stop me from being honest. That could never break me, because I'm not the one that lives with that karma. D'you know? So I look at it like there's a machine surrounding this business, which I have no control over, and you just have to let the machine do what it does.\" </p> <p>And suddenly, with her perfect face and famous parents and great career, you feel oddly, unshakeably sorry for her. Like most of us at two months shy of our 22nd birthdays, her life experience is short, her opinions somewhat woozy, and here she is, a nice, talented, faintly new-agey girl stuck in rooms like this with people like me who - even when they refrain from implying her mother secretly hates her - ask if her husband's a daddy substitute and whether she takes drugs. \"You know,\" she says, \"it's like when we were talking about the film making me famous. It is what it is. You do this thing, then the machine takes over. And that's that.\" </p> <p>So, through your chippie, British cynicism, you believe her when she says that, while ambitious (\"Totally! I'm an Aries!\"), she isn't what you'd call competitive. \"Only when I'm about to kick someone's ass at Yahtzee. Or soccer.\" You play football? \"Used to.\" Any good? \" Yeah . Oh yeah . . . But I mean, I look at it like there's no reason to ever be competitive about anybody else's life, or career, or opportunities. D'you know? Because everybody's path happens for a reason.\" And you believe it because she believes it, and then you feel bad the moment you say that, while she may not be competitive, there's probably a lot of actresses failing auditions who look at her glamorous background and glittering future and feel competitive as hell. </p> <p>The pause that follows is long; longer even than the pause that followed the pot question. \"I've never experienced that,\" she says eventually. \"It's not something I've ever . . . I mean, as far as being friendly with other actors and actresses, I've always been friendly with the ones that I've worked with . . .\" She trails off, and then you get the smile again. </p> <p>\"See, my thing is I'm not actually fighting with anybody for anything. I'm just having a great time, living my life as if I'm going to die tomorrow. D'you know what I mean? The rest is just the machine.\"</p>",

D'you know what I mean?\" Although they were only married in the new year, she knows the questions about her 34-year-old \"soulmate\" Robinson will come soon enough - most hedging, delicately or otherwise, around his role as a surrogate father: \"Which, of course, is ridiculous. I have a dad. Kurt's my dad.\" Yet two and two will surely be put together, particularly with Hudson's biological father Bill walking out on the family when his daughter was barely out of nappies (Russell moved in thereafter). Last autumn, the pair exchanged harsh, public words after Hudson Jr complained that her father \"doesn't know me from a hole in the wall\". Add in the curiosity surrounding her mother - largely devoted to who's bitterly envious of whom - and you can see why she might be sick of discussing her family. \"It's weird,\" she says. \"I'm not, because I love them, and I miss them, and I like to talk about them. But I don't like the mundane questions. Because it's always, is my mom jealous of me? which is something I get very offended by, or am I jealous of her? And these questions mean nothing. They're just mundane. Because the only answer is no, of course not. Or someone'll say, 'Oh, before you go to awards ceremonies, does your mother give you red carpet tips?' And you go, 'Who do you think we are?' My mother's a Buddhist, for Christ's sake. Who thinks we sit around with her giving me tips on walking down red carpets?\" It's unfortunate, I say, but you've both become symbols of Hollywood's ageing process. One day, for example, you'll no longer be referred to as Goldie Hawn's daughter, and she'll be nothing but Kate Hudson's mother. D'you know what I mean? \"Yeah, I see that. I mean, in other people's eyes. But it's so funny, because that's what we are. She's my mom, I'm her daughter, and we're damn proud of each other. We don't look at each other as actresses .\" She peers at her coffee, cold in the cup. \"But it's like . . . I've been burned so many times already. Misquoted so many times. But that will never stop me from being honest. That could never break me, because I'm not the one that lives with that karma. D'you know? So I look at it like there's a machine surrounding this business, which I have no control over, and you just have to let the machine do what it does.\" And suddenly, with her perfect face and famous parents and great career, you feel oddly, unshakeably sorry for her. Like most of us at two months shy of our 22nd birthdays, her life experience is short, her opinions somewhat woozy, and here she is, a nice, talented, faintly new-agey girl stuck in rooms like this with people like me who - even when they refrain from implying her mother secretly hates her - ask if her husband's a daddy substitute and whether she takes drugs. \"You know,\" she says, \"it's like when we were talking about the film making me famous. It is what it is. You do this thing, then the machine takes over. And that's that.\" So, through your chippie, British cynicism, you believe her when she says that, while ambitious (\"Totally! I'm an Aries!\"), she isn't what you'd call competitive. \"Only when I'm about to kick someone's ass at Yahtzee. Or soccer.\" You play football? \"Used to.\" Any good? \" Yeah . Oh yeah . . . But I mean, I look at it like there's no reason to ever be competitive about anybody else's life, or career, or opportunities. D'you know? Because everybody's path happens for a reason.\" And you believe it because she believes it, and then you feel bad the moment you say that, while she may not be competitive, there's probably a lot of actresses failing auditions who look at her glamorous background and glittering future and feel competitive as hell. The pause that follows is long; longer even than the pause that followed the pot question. \"I've never experienced that,\" she says eventually. \"It's not something I've ever . . . I mean, as far as being friendly with other actors and actresses, I've always been friendly with the ones that I've worked with . . .\" She trails off, and then you get the smile again. \"See, my thing is I'm not actually fighting with anybody for anything. I'm just having a great time, living my life as if I'm going to die tomorrow. D'you know what I mean? The rest is just the machine.\"",

      "bodyText": "The BBC could use licence-fee payers' money to fund a giveaway of digital TV equipment, Greg Dyke revealed today. Speaking at the Commons media select committee, the BBC director general surprised his audience by saying that the corporation had already been in talks about how to achieve universal digital coverage. His remarks were unexpected - the subject of a possible giveaway of set-top boxes or other technology has always been something of a taboo in the broadcasting industry, who want to encourage as much take-up as possible without having to resort to free equipment. Responding to questions about how universal take-up of digital television could be achieved, Mr Dyke said he hoped the BBC's new services - the proposed new BBC3, BBC4 and two children's channels - would be a significant driving force. But he indicated that the BBC could become involved in a future giveaway or subsidy of boxes. \"We have been doing a lot of work on this. Could you give them away, and could the BBC fund them?\" he asked. BBC sources later attempted to play down Mr Dyke's remarks, saying that most people would be attracted to digital television by the prospect of the corporation's new services. And other broadcasting sources doubted that the BBC would ever use licence-fee payers' money in such a way. But Mr Dyke's comments have brought into the public arena a debate that has been conducted within the industry about how to convert the final 25-30% of TV viewers who expected to be either unwilling or unable to transfer to digital. At the moment, take-up rates in Britain are healthy: about 6m homes, around 30%, have digital television. The government wants to switch off the analogue signal between 2006 and 2010. Chris Smith, the culture secretary, has said that 98% of viewers in a transmitter area must have converted to digital before the analogue signal can be switched off. However, industry estimates suggest that the digital take-up will level off at 75%. It is likely, at that stage, that the government and the TV industry will consider giving away, or heavily subsidising, boxes or other receiving equipment such as digital televisions. Some industry figures believe the government has not thought hard enough about the problem: there was little mention of it in the recent communications white paper.",

The \u00a3300,000 cost of Cosla membership will be spent on special needs education for autistic children.</p> <p>Council leader Charles Gordon said: \"Glasgow city council is a large, influential local authority and we feel confident that we will be able to deal directly with the Scottish executive and the Scottish parliament when there are issues on which we want to put a case. Glasgow is not going to be pushed around - it is going to punch its weight.\"</p> <p>The council said after that it was in its best interests to deal directly with the Scottish executive. \"We don't need any middle-organisation to do it. It may be a matter of convenience for the Scottish executive, but they now have to take into account that Cosla represents 31 councils and Glasgow puts its own case. And it's unlikely the executive will turn its back on Scotland's biggest council,\" said a spokesman.</p> <p>Cosla said it was \"a matter of great regret\" that Glasgow had decided to pull out, but denied its future was under threat. \"I am extremely sorry that Glasgow city council has taken this decision. The importance of local government speaking with one voice across the country cannot be over-stated and for more than 25 years Cosla has provided the platform for Scottish councils to do that,\" said president Norman Murray.</p> <p>\"We are committed to continuing to represent Scottish councils at all levels and we are determined to go on with the excellent work of the organisation with the support of Scotland's 31 other local authorities which are committed to maintaining their membership.</p> <p>\"While the loss of the expertise that Glasgow has brought to Cosla will be missed, there remains a wealth of experience in Scottish local government at both councillor and officer levels that will be brought to bear at all levels of the organisation's operations.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Scotland's largest council has pulled out of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla), claiming its membership fee would be better spent elsewhere. Glasgow city council has been unhappy with Cosla since it failed to convince the Scottish executive that a three-year increase in local authority funds should be skewed in favour of those areas with the highest levels of deprivation. Now Glasgow claims it is not getting best value from Cosla membership and says it will make its own representations directly to the Scottish executive and the parliament. The decision to withdraw came at a meeting today, when councillors unanimously approved a \u00a32bn budget for next year with a below-inflation council tax increase of 2.4%. The \u00a3300,000 cost of Cosla membership will be spent on special needs education for autistic children. Council leader Charles Gordon said: \"Glasgow city council is a large, influential local authority and we feel confident that we will be able to deal directly with the Scottish executive and the Scottish parliament when there are issues on which we want to put a case. Glasgow is not going to be pushed around - it is going to punch its weight.\" The council said after that it was in its best interests to deal directly with the Scottish executive. \"We don't need any middle-organisation to do it. It may be a matter of convenience for the Scottish executive, but they now have to take into account that Cosla represents 31 councils and Glasgow puts its own case. And it's unlikely the executive will turn its back on Scotland's biggest council,\" said a spokesman. Cosla said it was \"a matter of great regret\" that Glasgow had decided to pull out, but denied its future was under threat. \"I am extremely sorry that Glasgow city council has taken this decision. The importance of local government speaking with one voice across the country cannot be over-stated and for more than 25 years Cosla has provided the platform for Scottish councils to do that,\" said president Norman Murray. \"We are committed to continuing to represent Scottish councils at all levels and we are determined to go on with the excellent work of the organisation with the support of Scotland's 31 other local authorities which are committed to maintaining their membership. \"While the loss of the expertise that Glasgow has brought to Cosla will be missed, there remains a wealth of experience in Scottish local government at both councillor and officer levels that will be brought to bear at all levels of the organisation's operations.\"",

      "bodyText": "\"Partnership\" has become the new buzz word in industrial relations, with partnership agreements signed in many companies, but what relevance does it have for the voluntary sector? Some would argue that the often shared values between management and staff in charities means that any overt partnership arrangement is unnecessary. But, according to new research, voluntary organisations should not be so complacent. Partnership deals have become increasingly common in the private sector, as part of a move away from old-style confrontational labour relations. The approach often means management recognises the rights of employees to influence decision making and provides access to information on decisions, while, for their part, staff commit to the success of the organisation and may agree to flexible working conditions. At a seminar on partnership at work, held during the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) conference, Peter Reilly of the Institute for Employment Studies unveiled a study of partnership working in the sector. The generally high level of agreement between management and staff over the direction of organisations and shared values meant voluntary organisations were in many ways ideal candidates for partnership, he said. He studied approaches to management in eight unionised charities and found a high degree of consensus-based decision making and involvement of staff. But Mr Reilly also found managers could assume that, because staff and managers shared similar basic values, there were never any separate interests to take into account. \"There can be a belief that because everyone works for the same organisation they share the same interests. But that's not always the case, especially in areas like pay,\" he said. Alison Lamb, co-ordinator for the NCVO partnership at work project, said there was a particular need to try and reach senior people in charities, who may be reluctant to engage in genuine partnership with staff. One seminar attendee said: \"I'm in favour of partnership but whenever other senior managers in my charity hear the word 'trade union' they run a mile.\" Ms Lamb acknowledged this problem: \"We need to get senior managers and trustees to sign up to partnership.\" Co-speaker Chris Ball, voluntary sector secretary at the MSF union for skilled and professional people, agreed that, in many ways, the voluntary sector had a head start in adopting a partnership approach. He pointed to examples of partnership working involving the union, such as a scheme with the voluntary sector on Merseyside for training union representatives to become learning representatives. \"There are a lot of obstacles to employees' training, so we're hoping that smaller voluntary organisations will be able to use the union and its distance learning website,\" he said.",

The move is an attempt to focus on a portfolio of the most profitable core products. But at a press conference today, Unilever chairman Antony Burgmans said: \"Four hundred is not a fixed figure. \"I wouldn't be surprised at a more compact number, such as 375.\" Mr Burgmans said the company would announce how many brands it plans to keep when it releases half-year figures in August. It is taking a long, hard look at the Bestfoods portfolio - which includes the Knorr and Hellman's brands - which it bought for \u00a314.6bn last year. As part of the company's sweeping restructure, the number of Unilever brands has been slashed to 970. Of the 570 remaining brands selected for elimination, around 300 are expected to disappear by the end of 2002. The remaining 270 will be sold or merged into leading brands over the next 24 months, Mr Burgmans said. Sales of the core portfolio of 400 brands grew 4.9% in the fourth quarter and 3.8% over the past 12 months. Unilever has already sold brands such as Batchelors and Oxo to the Campbell Soup Company. But some new products have been added as the result of several big takeovers last year. These include Slimfast diet products and Ben and Jerry's ice-cream.

ITV revealed today that BSkyB was asking more than \u00a320m a year for carrying ITV and ITV2 on Sky Digital. In a submission to the Department of Culture, Media &amp; Sport's select committee on the communications white paper, ITV claimed that the charge - 30p per subscriber per month - was \"almost pure profit\". ITV initially refused to put its two channels onto the Sky Digital platform. In the past few months, however, talks between the two sides have taken place. BSkyB regulatory chief Michael Rhodes, who was being quizzed about the developments by the committee, admitted both broadcasters had held \"various meetings over the last six months\". Mr Rhodes said \u00a320m \"could be in the top end\" of the figure being discussed. But he dismissed ITV's claim that this annual payment would be pure profit. \"Oftel entitles us to earn a reasonable return on the costs that we have incurred in putting the platform in place. To describe it as pure profit can't be correct,\" said Mr Rhodes. Sky is justifying the cost on the grounds that Oftel allows it to generate \"a reasonable rate of return\" the so-called \"automatically entitled\" conditional access it needs to make ITV freely available in the UK but not outside. But ITV's director of finance and development, Kate Stross, argued that Sky was charging far more in real terms than it charged the BBC when it signed carriage deals in 1998. \"We don't know exactly what the BBC's paying.

The incident triggered a huge security alert in Washington, with streets cordoned off as police spread out around the White House. The incident took place less than half an hour after the British foreign secretary, Robin Cook, had left the building after meeting Mr Bush's foreign affairs advisers. Mr Pickett was not listed in any secret service files as a threat, police sources said. Neighbours in Evansville described him as an accountant, a friendly man and a frequent jogger. \"I was really surprised. As far as I knew he was an outstanding neighbour,\" said one, Lewis Gates. Last night, secret service agents searched Mr Pickett's home for firearms, threatening letters and evidence of involvement with militia groups. Secret Service agent Jim Dennis said in the search warrant that aides to the Indiana congressman John Hostettler indicated that Mr Pickett had sent letters to his offices in the past year about grievances he had with the Internal Revenue Service. Security at the White House was tightened during the Clinton era but the shooting incident is certain to lead to fresh examination of the terms on which the public has access. Mr Bush has already been the subject of a variety of threats since he became president last month. This week, an 18-year-old man in Wisconsin was jailed for threatening to kill him and last week, two boys from Staffordshire were questioned by Special Branch officers after sending a death threat in an email to the White House.",

In all, some 12 staff have been laid off, and 'bureaux' in Germany, Hong Kong and Sydney have been closed down. Managing director David Massey said the company would now aim to generate sales of the \u00a3400-a-year information service in the UK and the US. \"This restructuring of our business combined with the strong sales pipeline will address our core areas more effectively and accelerate our path to profitability,\" he said. As part of the realignment, a new sales director has been appointed in San Francisco to drive subscriptions. Three of the redundancies are in the IT department and \"a couple\" of less high-profile journalists at the website have lost their jobs. The451.com was launched last April by a number of national journalists, including Paul Taylor from the Financial Times and Dawn Hayes from Sunday Business. The job losses and strategy rethink are aimed at reducing The451.com's monthly cash burn, reported to be around \u00a3200,000 per month. The company, which is 62% owned by investment group Durlacher, still refuses to give out subscriber numbers but maintains it is meeting targets.",

      "body": "<p>As storm-clouds gather over the telecoms market, the peddlers of \"third- generation\" futurology should be looking to the example set by the eleventh-hour rescue of the doomed satellite network, Iridium. </p> <p>With a \u00a322 billion debt owed for third-generation licences in the UK alone, and nothing but a portfolio of concept pictures to substantiate the dream, the hype surrounding the 3G Universal Mobile Telephony System (UMTS) demands considerable suspension of disbelief. The same leap of faith was demanded by Iridium, which cost $7 billion to set up, went belly-up and was \"saved\" in a deal that valued it at a mere $25 million, sweetened by a $72 million contract from the US government. You could see it as a net value of minus $47 million. The alternative was to burn the satellites by crashing them through the earth's atmosphere. It might have been cheaper in the long run. </p> <p>It's amazing that anyone could have got their sums so wrong. And what is more amazing is that it is about to happen again. The 3G licence debt is already starting to hurt. The mobile networks are finding it hard to borrow money to build the infrastructure they need. </p> <p>The mobile phone business is hugely profitable. Ten years ago, the mobile was a joke prop in films about Wall Street wealth. Now, there are 700 million GSM phones in use across the world. Each customer spends about \u00a330 a month. It is not surprising that Iridium thought it could make money: it needed less than 1% of the world market to do well. </p> <p>Where there is a lot of money there is a lot of competition. The rivalry of mobile telecoms, however, is restricted by physics and legislation. Here we have a lucrative, legislated oligopoly. No wonder so many people want a part of it. That's why the UK 3G licences sold for so much. A second reason was that the incumbent networks could see that if they didn't buy a licence they were going to go out of business. The licences effectively became worth as much as the individual companies so long as the sixth bidder kept playing. It's possible that with only three licences, the prices would have gone even higher. </p> <p>With each network having spent upwards of \u00a34 billion on a bit of paper - just to gain the right to spend as much again in constructing a new national network - the 3G market is going to have to be worth nearly 10 times the cost of GSM. It is hard to see where the money is going to come from to do this. There won't be 10 times as many users. That would mean five phones per person in the UK, from the babe in the pushchair to the geriatric in a bathchair. It is possible that we'll see more than one GSM connection per person as the real futurology starts and the technology starts to get built into devices like vending machines and cars. But 500% penetration is asking too much. </p> <p>And frankly, will anyone want to use it at all? That was where Iridium went wrong. While Iridium projected over a million users, it achieved only 100,000. There were a lot of problems: coverage problems, frightening prices, great big ugly handsets. All these problems will be revisited with 3G. </p> <p>Iridium didn't - sorry, doesn't - work indoors. It was based on dual mode handsets, which could use either the ordinary GSM mobile phone network or, for trips further afield, the Iridium satellite network. You had islands of GSM coverage in a sea of Iridium. </p> <p>Today third generation coverage is being talked about in terms of islands of UMTS in a sea of GSM. Again, we will have dual mode handsets to use the existing GSM coverage, and only switch into 3G in those areas where it is installed. You'll pay a premium for a phone which won't even deliver 3G benefits for a lot of the time. </p> <p>Quite how much you will pay is yet to be discovered. It is impossible to guess what a handset will cost, but an existing GSM phone has a bill of materials of around $90. This gives a sensible retail price of \u00a3180, less a \u00a3150 network subsidy common in the UK market, to sell for \u00a330. The low bill of materials is very much down to the economies of scale. </p> <p>Mobile phone manufacturers, selling into a world market, expect to sell a million handsets over the life of the phone before they turn on the production line. New entrant Sendo, which prides itself on its efficiency, boasts that it only needs to sell 500,000 handsets over several designs to break even. </p> <p>Those economies of scale will not exist for third generation. What's more, the components will be much more expensive. It is rash to speculate, but a $900 bill of materials might be conservative. The phones will do a lot more. They will have colour screens and a lot of memory. They will also need to feel like a premium product. Subsidising this down to \u00a330 will not be realistic, so the quantities drop and the price goes up. </p> <p>Traditionally prices would be recouped through call charges, but in the middle of a long-running tariff war there isn't much scope for a premium rate service. Some early adopters might pay a bit more than the typical 15p a minute peak rate, but the mass market is focused on bundled inclusive airtime, with many peripheral services coming in for free. Orange is currently offering free Wap calls at the weekend, Genie flat rate text messaging and One 2 One free voicemail. Selling premium rate services against this, even if the coverage were not patchy, would be nigh on impossible. </p> <p>The final blow is the unbridgeable gap between selling the concept and facing up to the reality. Concept photos of proposed 3G phones show slimline, sleek models the size of a powder-compact. The pictures bear little or no relation to the handsets that will really be available to early adopters, which are likely to be clunky and ugly, with a poor battery life, heat problems and unimpressive screens. </p> <p>The technical require ments for 3G are horribly complicated, which means you need a lot of computing power, which in turn bumps up not only the cost but the size of the battery. We could see the new phones drawing something like 50 times as much power as an existing one. </p> <p>This means third generation phones are going to need enormous batteries by today's standards. Some manufacturers argue that between now and the launch of the first third generation systems in two years, we'll see the improvements necessary to get handset sizes down to be comparable with today's GSM, that's around 100g. This seems incredibly optimistic, particularly given the probable lack of demand. </p> <p>So the target customers become people prepared to pay a premium for big clunky handsets that occasionally give better performance than their elegant GSM one. The next stage will be for the networks to argue that typical customers will have two handsets: a GSM one for everyday and a third generation one for when they need it. Again this was an Iridium argument. </p> <p>There is a further problem which didn't affect Iridium: too many handset manufacturers looking for a piece of the pie. There are around 20 mobile phone manufacturers with even more companies eyeing third generation. They all want to be the next Nokia, so they will fight for market share by selling phones at a loss. For the first time, the Japanese manufacturers become a real threat. Until now, Japan has largely missed out on GSM, because it was never launched in Japan. So Scandinavia got to rule the roost. </p> <p>Things will be different in the third generation. Japan launches its 3G commercial service well before the rest - 2001, as opposed to 2003 in the UK. And it will be in demand. In Japan, the capacity problems we have seen recently on UK networks are increased many times over, because there is a more limited spectrum allocation on the PHS system used there. This means expansion of the existing networks is not an option. Instead, 3G is the solution. So the Japanese market will have a need for 3G that we don't have here, where networks are expanding their capacity into alternative spectrum. </p> <p>Visible demand will give the Japanese manufacturers more room to manoeuvre. The established order of Nokia leading, followed by Motorola and Ericsson, is severely under threat. The only Western company to have grasped this is Siemens. Currently dicing with Ericsson for third spot and with an excellent product portfolio, Siemens has looked to the future. An infrastructure deal with NEC and a handset deal with Casio will give Siemens an entry into the Japanese market. The Japanese partners can learn a lot from Siemens today, and in a couple of years Siemens will reap the rewards when it is an experienced manufacturer of third generation handsets. Whether even this is profitable remains to be seen.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The UN general secretary is the anti-christ who comes from Russia and has taken over the world. The true believers in Christ have been gathered up and taken to heaven and non-believers must now suffer for the seven years. That is the plot of a film which opened this week in hundreds of US cinemas, has already set box-office records, and is being heralded as a way for evangelical Christianity to tackle Hollywood on its home ground. Left Behind: the Movie was released after a huge campaign by US evangelists to persuade cinema chains to show such films on the big screen. It coincided with the inauguration of a born-again president who was generously funded by the religious right, which now senses a new cultural mood in the country. Left Behind was produced by Cloud Ten, a Toronto company owned by Peter and Paul Lalonde, and originally released as a video last year. It sold 2.5m copies, prompting the plan to press cinemas to show it. A sophisticated email write-in campaign which drew on the estimated 75m evangelical community persuaded distributors that the film was likely to do well. It is now on show at 900 cinemas, an extraordinary achievement for an independent film by any standards but even more remarkable for one that had sold so well on video. Churches have also helped by giving away tickets. Starring Kirk Cameron - best known for his role in the 1980s sitcom Growing Pains - and Chelsea Noble, the film takes its theme from The Revelation of St John, the most popular book the bible for many fundamentalists. It shows the world taken over by evil forces, embodied in the UN, always a bete noir of the religious right. While Christians are gathered up to heaven in \"the rapture\", others must spend a period of penance on Earth suffering under a character called Nicolae Carpathia, whose accent shows that he is Russian. The new evangelical feature films go well beyond traditional fare with a religious theme, such as The Ten Commandments and Ben Hur. They are partly based on the success of the series of novels on which Left Behind is based. Such books have become bestsellers with little or no marketing or reviews in the literary pages of newspapers. Previous successes on the apocalyptic theme include The Omega Code, which came out in 1999 and will be followed soon by a sequel, Megiddo - Omega Code II. The Omega Code, marketed as \"the film that shook up Hollywood\", starred Michael York, Casper Van Dien (Starship Troopers), Michael Ironside and Catherine Oxenberg. Time magazine called it \"the Blair God Project\". Another Christian film, The Champion, about a boxer, is due out next month. Distributors hope to exploit what they believe is a vast audience anxious to see such movies on the big screen. With an actors' and writers' strike in the offing in Hollywood this summer, producers of such films will also be eyeing the possibility of advancing into more cinemas with their product. \"This is a very large niche market I think the studios have missed,\" Peter Lalonde of Cloud Ten Pictures said. \"We can create a grassroots army on behalf of this film.\" His claim is backed up by Christiancinema.com, a website listing 100-plus titles. Most of these films were made on small budgets, but the new Omega Code and Left Behind both had about \u00a312m, the sort of sum a major independent production enjoys. Not all of the themes are so doomladen. World Wide Pictures, part of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, is releasing a comedy called Road to Redemption. If films like this continue to succeed, the big Hollywood studios are likely to want to get in on the biblical act, too. In recent years Hollywood has been attacked for presenting a Godless picture of American life, and both George Bush and Al Gore referred in the election campaigns to a desire to clamp down on un acceptable images of violence. Senior Hollywood executives were summoned to Washington to give evidence to the Senate commerce committee on the marketing of violent material to under-age children. The industry was effectively warned to clean up its act or face possible legislation. Religious groups have attacked what they see as blasphemy in mainstream movies, running from Monty Python's The Life of Brian to last year's release Dogma, in which God was portrayed on the screen as a black woman.",

Pre-pay customers have driven the surge in mobile users over the past two years - representing 77% of One2One's 8.3m customers. The new Talk &amp; Text plan includes 50 text messages and 500 minutes of off-peak local and national calls a month for \u00a315. As an incentive to customers to sign up for pay monthly contracts, those who connect to the One2One network until April 30 will also receive 50 free text messages per month for three months, although the free quota can only be sent to other One2One numbers.",

It was a couple of days after his arrival last September and we were browsing the same bookshelf in the library. He asked me what the prison was like. \"Relatively quiet,\" I told him.

Donny Braggs is dead.\" \"You're kidding,\" I said. I pressed him for details. It was important to be sure we were talking about the same man. Satisfied we were, I asked him what had happened. \"He was stabbed in the leg in a nightclub,\" he said. \"Gangrene set in and it killed him.\" \"Christ,\" I said, and sighed a deep sigh. </p> <p>Thirteen years had passed but I had never forgotten my run-in with Donny Braggs. We were on the same wing at the time. Donny was \"on the book\" (Category A prisoner) and was known for his short temper. One sleepy-eyed Monday morning I bumped into him outside my cell door with my breakfast tray. Immediately he began ranting and hurling abuse. His racket was drawing dozens of pairs of eyes in our direction so I implored him to come into my cell. \"The screws will be on us in a minute.\" I said, \"Come on, I'll make us a cup of tea.\" </p> <p>He followed me in, but straight away recommenced his tirade. He was becoming hysterical. Realising I had made a mistake I grabbed the front of his shirt, intending to shove him back outside. Instead Donny wrong footed me and swung me around full circle.

The new programme will also showcase the talents of Ronnie Ancona, who plays Posh to Alistair McGowan's Becks in BBC1's Alistair McGowan's Big Impression, and newcomer Karen Taylor, a Daily Telegraph Open Mic Award finalist. The eight-part series will go out later this year in a post-watershed slot on ITV.

The programme has been commissioned by ITV controller of comedy Sioned Wiliam. In recent years ITV has struggled to establish any new comedy series of the sketch or sitcom variety. Gwen Taylor comedy vehicle Barbara has just secured a third series and ITV is about to launch new sitcom High Stakes, starring Richard Wilson as a merchant banker.

      "bodyText": "The Daily Express's circulation figures have fallen to their lowest in the paper's history. The paper's sales have plummeted to below the 1m mark. This represents a loss of more than 70,000 copies, a fall of 6.8% year-on-year and a 2.2% decline on last month. The Express has argued the decline is partly due to a recent decision to drop the paper's bulk circulation strategy. The circulation figure includes some \"optional exclusions\" from the Audit Bureau of Circulations. These allow newspapers to exclude days of the year - such as national holidays - when the circulation is likely to be particularly low. In figures to be published tomorrow, the Express's losses are expected to contrast with gains made by its arch-rival the Daily Mail. The Mail has enjoyed an circulation increase of 125,000 as the result of an aggressive marketing campaign. The Daily Mirror is also expected to post a circulation decline of 120,000.

      "bodyText": "Seaweed Day in Japan is usually marked by the satisfied chomping of millions of sushi balls wrapped in crispy sheets of dark-green laver. This week, however, the festive munching on February 6 was overshadowed by an alarming decline in seaweed harvests that has been blamed on the country's most notorious land-reclamation project. The existence of an annual Seaweed Day underlines the importance that Japan places on its ocean flora harvest and why its depletion has raised public hackles in a way that other environmental problems have largely failed to do. Each year, shoppers snap up more than 4bn sheets of nori (laver), which are torn into strips to garnish noodles or wrapped around balls of sushi. This is nothing new. Seaweed Day marks the anniversary 1,300 years ago of a new legal code that recognized nori as a suitable tribute for the emperor. The same could certainly not be said of the seaweed at the centre of the current storm of protest. Until recently, Ariake Sea nori was among the most prized in Japan. Harvested in the waters off Kyushu in southern Japan, it was once prized for its dark colour - a sign of good nutrition - and crispy texture when dried. Such was the demand and abundance of the crop, that the area supplied 40% of all the nori consumed in Japan. Last year, however, the harvest hit record low levels and the quality of the crop was shockingly bad. Instead of a lustrous black-green, the nori was a soggy beige - and nobody wanted it. In the ten months until January, sales of laver dropped by 25%. Furious fishermen, seaweed harvesters and local politicians have no doubt where the blame lies: the five-mile-long Isahaya Bay sluice gate that was lowered in 1997 to reclaim 3,550 hectares of land. According to conservationists, the project has devastated the ecosystems both of the dried-up wetlands inside the barrier and the sea outside. By disrupting the flow of seawater from the East China sea, they say, the sluice gate has allowed plankton to flourish at the expense of the nori. More than 6,000 fisherman in 1,000 boats have staged an angry protest demanding that the government lift the barrier's 300 shutters. The government, however, says it lacks evidence to link the reclamation project and the devastation of the seaweed crop. It is not the first time that the Isahaya Bay project has come under fire. The project was dreamed up 30 years ago when farmland was scarce, but Japan now has so much more agricultural land than it needs that it pays some farmers to leave their fields fallow. Although the original logic for the project faded long ago, the powerful construction lobby encouraged bureaucrats and politicians in the ruling Liberal Democratic party to push ahead with the plan on the grounds of flood control. As with numerous other wasteful public works projects around Japan, critics have focused on the inefficient use of taxpayers' money, but the collapse of the nori harvest has highlighted the growing environmental costs of such ill-conceived plans. Given the importance and prestige of seaweed in the national diet, it may yet even force the government into a rare change of heart. The Isahaya Bay project has been blamed for the extinction of local mud skippers and other wetland animals, as well as a decline in fish stocks in surrounding waters, but none of these natural tragedies has made the same impact on the national consciousness as the deterioration of the nori crop. Questions have been tabled in parliament, newspapers have given the subject intensive coverage and opposition party politicians have braved the elements to show solidarity with the hard-pressed nori harvesters. So far the impact has been purely psychological, but it could soon start to hit Japanese wallets. Nori prices around Japan have jumped by between ten and 60% as a result of the poor Ariake sea harvest and analysts warn that it is only a matter of time before the increased costs are passed on to the consumer. If sushi prices rise, the government will find it difficult to avoid the question of why it puts public works before the environment. Seaweed could yet force the Isahaya Bay sluice gates open.

More than 30m romantic text messages are expected to be relayed on Valentine's Day. A \"love poll\" from Virgin Mobile found one in four of its users plan to send a Valentine's Day text message. More tellingly, a whopping 75% said they would be happy to receive a text message in place of a card or bunch of flowers. \"Whoever said romance is dead has obviously never used a mobile phone,\" said a Virgin Mobile spokesman. \"Instead of counting how many Valentines cards we get this year, we'll be keeping our eyes out for the number of messages we receive on our phones.\" For those who believe in the sanctity of anonymity, help is at hand. Various web-based SMS services - offered by Excite.co.uk, Lycos.co.uk and Breathe.com - and network operators plan to offer special anonymous Valentines services. Vodafone is offering users the choice of 10 anonymous Valentine's messages: from \"Hve I told U l8tly that I luv u?\" to \"Roses r red, violets r blue, did u know that I love u? Guess who?\". Vodafone expects Valentine's Day to break all messaging records. Its last big day was January 1, when 11m messages were sent over its network. However, Royal Mail is refusing to be browbeaten. It expects the number of Valentine's cards sent in the post to be up by between 2m and 12m on last year. \"Our research clearly shows people like receiving and sending written material for special occasions and many treasure their old cards,\" said a spokesman. \"Someone's handwriting can reval a lot and that makes receiving a Valentine's card from an admirer even more exciting.\" The Virgin Mobile \"love poll\" concluded that text messaging is to become the top aid to romance and dating in the 21st century. Approximately 50% of \"spoken for\" and married people plan to send romantic messages this Valentine's Day. However, these may not necessarily be to their partners: a sneaky 6% plan to send a love text to an ex-partner. One in every two single people use text messaging to ask someone out on a date, while 43% of people believe text messaging makes people more flirtatious. One in four single people think they might get lucky this Valentine's Day because texting allows them to be more promiscuous.

      "body": "<p>The hill people and the Mexicans arrived on the same day. It was a Wednesday, early in September 1952. The Cardinals were five games behind the Dodgers with three weeks to go, and the season looked hopeless. The cotton, however, was waist-high to my father, over my head, and he and my grandfather could be heard before supper whispering words that were seldom heard. It could be a \"good crop.\" </p> <p> They were farmers, hardworking men who embraced pessimism only when discussing the weather and the crops. There was too much sun, or too much rain, or the threat of floods in the lowlands, or the rising prices of seed and fertilizer, or the uncertainties of the markets. On the most perfect of days, my mother would quietly say to me, \"Don't worry. The men will find something to worry about.\" </p> <p> Pappy, my grandfather, was worried about the price for labor when we went searching for the hill people. They were paid for every hundred pounds of cotton they picked. The previous year, according to him, it was $1.50 per hundred. He'd already heard rumors that a farmer over in Lake City was offering $1.60. </p> <p> This played heavily on his mind as we rode to town. He never talked when he drove, and this was because, according to my mother, not much of a driver herself, he was afraid of motorized vehicles. His truck was a 1939 Ford, and with the exception of our old John Deere tractor, it was our sole means of transportation. This was no particular problem except when we drove to church and my mother and grandmother were forced to sit snugly together up front in their Sunday best while my father and I rode in the back, engulfed in dust. Modern sedans were scarce in rural Arkansas. </p> <p> Pappy drove thirty-seven miles per hour. His theory was that every automobile had a speed at which it ran most efficiently, and through some vaguely defined method he had determined that his old truck should go thirty-seven. My mother said (to me) that it was ridiculous. She also said he and my father had once fought over whether the truck should go faster. But my father rarely drove it, and if I happened to be riding with him, he would level off at thirty-seven, out of respect for Pappy. My mother said she suspected he drove much faster when he was alone. </p> <p> We turned onto Highway 135, and, as always, I watched Pappy carefully shift the gears\u2014pressing slowly on the clutch, delicately prodding the stick shift on the steering column\u2014until the truck reached its perfect speed. Then I leaned over to check the speedometer: thirty-seven. He smiled at me as if we both agreed that the truck belonged at that speed. </p> <p> Highway 135 ran straight and flat through the farm country of the Arkansas Delta. On both sides as far as I could see, the fields were white with cotton. It was time for the harvest, a wonderful season for me because they turned out school for two months. For my grandfather, though, it was a time of endless worry. </p> <p>On the right, at the Jordan place, we saw a group of Mexicans working in the field near the road. They were stooped at the waist, their cotton sacks draped behind them, their hands moving deftly through the stalks, tearing off the bolls. Pappy grunted. He didn't like the Jordans because they were Methodists\u2014and Cubs fans. Now that they already had workers in their fields, there was another reason to dislike them. </p> <p> The distance from our farm to town was fewer than eight miles, but at thirty-seven miles an hour, the trip took twenty minutes. Always twenty minutes, even with little traffic. Pappy didn't believe in passing slower vehicles in front of him. Of course, he was usually the slow one. Near Black Oak, we caught up to a trailer filled to the top with snowy mounds of freshly picked cotton. A tarp covered the front half, and the Montgomery twins, who were my age, playfully bounced around in all that cotton until they saw us on the road below them. Then they stopped and waved. I waved back, but my grandfather did not. When he drove, he never waved or nodded at folks, and this was, my mother said, because he was afraid to take his hands from the wheel. She said people talked about him behind his back, saying he was rude and arrogant. Personally, I don't think he cared how the gossip ran. </p> <p> We followed the Montgomery trailer until it turned at the cotton gin. It was pulled by their old Massey Harris tractor, and driven by Frank, the eldest Montgomery boy, who had dropped out of school in the fifth grade and was considered by everyone at church to be headed for serious trouble. </p> <p> Highway 135 became Main Street for the short stretch it took to negotiate Black Oak. We passed the Black Oak Baptist Church, one of the few times we'd pass without stopping for some type of service. Every store, shop, business, church, even the school, faced Main Street, and on Saturdays the traffic inched along, bumper to bumper, as the country folks flocked to town for their weekly shopping. But it was Wednesday, and when we got into town, we parked in front of Pop and Pearl Watson's grocery store on Main. </p> <p> I waited on the sidewalk until my grandfather nodded in the direction of the store. That was my cue to go inside and purchase a Tootsie Roll, on credit. It only cost a penny, but it was not a foregone conclusion that I would get one every trip to town. Occasionally, he wouldn't nod, but I would enter the store anyway and loiter around the cash register long enough for Pearl to sneak me one, which always came with strict instructions not to tell my grandfather. She was afraid of him. Eli Chandler was a poor man, but he was intensely proud. He would starve to death before he took free food, which, on his list, included Tootsie Rolls. He would've beaten me with a stick if he knew I had accepted a piece of candy, so Pearl Watson had no trouble swearing me to secrecy. </p> <p> But this time I got the nod. As always, Pearl was dusting the counter when I entered and gave her a stiff hug. Then I grabbed a Tootsie Roll from the jar next to the cash register. I signed the charge slip with great flair, and Pearl inspected my penmanship. \"It's getting better, Luke,\" she said. </p> <p> \"Not bad for a seven-year-old,\" I said. Because of my mother, I had been practicing my name in cursive writing for two years. \"Where's Pop?\" I asked. They were the only adults I knew who insisted I call them by their \"first\" names, but only in the store when no one else was listening. If a customer walked in, then it was suddenly Mr. and Mrs. Watson. I told no one but my mother this, and she told me she was certain no other child held such privilege. </p> <p> \"In the back, putting up stock,\" Pearl said. \"Where's your grandfather?\" </p> <p> It was Pearl's calling in life to monitor the movements of the town's population, so any question was usually answered with another. </p> <p> \"The Tea Shoppe, checking on the Mexicans. Can I go back there?\" I was determined to outquestion her. </p> <p> \"Better not. Y'all using hill people, too?\" </p> <p> \"If we can find them. Eli says they don't come down like they used to. He also thinks they're all half crazy. Where's Champ?\" Champ was the store's ancient beagle, which never left Pop's side. </p> <p> Pearl grinned whenever I called my grandfather by his first name. She was about to ask me a question when the small bell clanged as the door opened and closed. A genuine Mexican walked in, alone and timid, as they all seemed to be at first. Pearl nodded politely at the new customer. </p> <p> I shouted, \"<em>Buenos d\u00edas, se\u00f1or!</em>\" </p> <p> The Mexican grinned and said sheepishly, \"<em>Buenos d\u00edas</em>,\" before disappearing into the back of the store. </p> <p> \"They're good people,\" Pearl said under her breath, as if the Mexican spoke English and might be offended by something nice she said. I bit into my Tootsie Roll and chewed it slowly while rewrapping and pocketing the other half. </p> <p> \"Eli's worried about payin' them too much,\" I said. With a customer in the store, Pearl was suddenly busy again, dusting and straightening around the only cash register. </p> <p> \"Eli worries about everything,\" she said. </p> <p> \"He's a farmer.\" </p> <p> \"Are you going to be a farmer?\" </p> <p> \"No ma'am. A baseball player.\" </p> <p> \"For the Cardinals?\" </p> <p> \"Of course.\" </p> <p> Pearl hummed for a bit while I waited for the Mexican. I had some more Spanish I was anxious to try. </p> <p> The old wooden shelves were bursting with fresh groceries. I loved the store during picking season because Pop filled it from floor to ceiling. The crops were coming in, and money was changing hands. </p> <p> Pappy opened the door just wide enough to stick his head in. \"Let's go,\" he said; then, \"Howdy, Pearl.\" </p> <p> \"Howdy, Eli,\" she said as she patted my head and sent me away. </p> <p> \"Where are the Mexicans?\" I asked Pappy when we were outside. </p> <p> \"Should be in later this afternoon.\" </p> <p> We got back in the truck and left town in the direction of Jonesboro, where my grandfather always found the hill people.</p> <p> We parked on the shoulder of the highway, near the intersection of a gravel road. In Pappy's opinion, it was the best spot in the county to catch the hill people. I wasn't so sure. He'd been trying to hire some for a week with no results. We sat on the tailgate in the scorching sun in complete silence for half an hour before the first truck stopped. It was clean and had good tires. If we were lucky enough to find hill people, they would live with us for the next two months. We wanted folks who were neat, and the fact that this truck was much nicer than Pappy's was a good sign. </p> <p> \"Afternoon,\" Pappy said when the engine was turned off. </p> <p> \"Howdy,\" said the driver. </p> <p> \"Where y'all from?\" asked Pappy. </p> <p> \"Up north of Hardy.\" </p> <p> With no traffic around, my grandfather stood on the pavement, a pleasant expression on his face, taking in the truck and its contents. The driver and his wife sat in the cab with a small girl between them. Three large teenaged boys were napping in the back. Everyone appeared to be healthy and well dressed. I could tell Pappy wanted these people. </p> <p> \"Y'all lookin' for work?\" he asked. </p> <p> \"Yep. Lookin' for Lloyd Crenshaw, somewhere west of Black Oak.\" My grandfather pointed this way and that, and they drove off. We watched them until they were out of sight. </p> <p> He could've offered them more than Mr. Crenshaw was promising. Hill people were notorious for negotiating their labor. Last year, in the middle of the first picking on our place, the Fulbrights from Calico Rock disappeared one Sunday night and went to work for a farmer ten miles away. </p> <p> But Pappy was not dishonest, nor did he want to start a bidding war. </p> <p> We tossed a baseball along the edge of a cotton field, stopping whenever a truck approached. </p> <p> My glove was a Rawlings that Santa had delivered the Christmas before. I slept with it nightly and oiled it weekly, and nothing was as dear to my soul. </p> <p> My grandfather, who had taught me how to throw and catch and hit, didn't need a glove. His large, callused hands absorbed my throws without the slightest sting. </p> <p> Though he was a quiet man who never bragged, Eli Chandler had been a legendary baseball player. At the age of seventeen, he had signed a contract with the Cardinals to play professional baseball. But the First War called him, and not long after he came home, his father died. Pappy had no choice but to become a farmer. </p> <p> Pop Watson loved to tell me stories of how great Eli Chandler had been\u2014how far he could hit a baseball, how hard he could throw one. \"Probably the greatest ever from Arkansas,\" was Pop's assessment. </p> <p> \"Better than Dizzy Dean?\" I would ask. </p> <p> \"Not even close,\" Pop would say, sighing. </p> <p> When I relayed these stories to my mother, she always smiled and said, \"Be careful. Pop tells tales.\" </p> <p> Pappy, who was rubbing the baseball in his mammoth hands, cocked his head at the sound of a vehicle. Coming from the west was a truck with a trailer behind it. From a quarter of a mile away we could tell they were hill people. We walked to the shoulder of the road and waited as the driver downshifted, gears crunching and whining as he brought the truck to a stop. </p> <p> I counted seven heads, five in the truck, two in the trailer. </p> <p> \"Howdy,\" the driver said slowly, sizing up my grandfather as we in turn quickly scrutinized them. </p> <p> \"Good afternoon,\" Pappy said, taking a step closer but still keeping his distance. </p> <p> Tobacco juice lined the lower lip of the driver. This was an ominous sign. My mother thought most hill people were prone to bad hygiene and bad habits. Tobacco and alcohol were forbidden in our home. We were Baptists. </p> <p> \"Name's Spruill,\" he said. </p> <p> \"Eli Chandler. Nice to meet you. Y'all lookin' for work?\" </p> <p> \"Yep.\" </p> <p> \"Where you from?\" </p> <p> \"Eureka Springs.\" </p> <p> The truck was almost as old as Pappy's, with slick tires and a cracked windshield and rusted fenders and what looked like faded blue paint under a layer of dust. A tier had been constructed above the bed, and it was crammed with cardboard boxes and burlap bags filled with supplies. Under it, on the floor of the bed, a mattress was wedged next to the cab. Two large boys stood on it, both staring blankly at me. Sitting on the tailgate, barefoot and shirtless, was a heavy young man with massive shoulders and a neck as thick as a stump. He spat tobacco juice between the truck and the trailer and seemed oblivious to Pappy and me. He swung his feet slowly, then spat again, never looking away from the asphalt beneath him. </p> <p> \"I'm lookin' for field hands,\" Pappy said. </p> <p> \"How much you payin'?\" Mr. Spruill asked. </p> <p> \"One-sixty a hundred,\" Pappy said. </p> <p> Mr. Spruill frowned and looked at the woman beside him. They mumbled something. </p> <p> It was at this point in the ritual that quick decisions had to be made. We had to decide whether we wanted these people living with us. And they had to accept or reject our price. </p> <p> \"What kinda cotton?\" Mr. Spruill asked. </p> <p> \"Stoneville,\" my grandfather said. \"The bolls are ready. It'll be easy to pick.\" Mr. Spruill could look around him and see the bolls bursting. The sun and soil and rains had cooperated so far. Pappy, of course, had been fretting over some dire rainfall prediction in the <em>Farmers' Almanac</em>. </p> <p> \"We got one-sixty last year,\" Mr. Spruill said. </p> <p> I didn't care for money talk, so I ambled along the center line to inspect the trailer. The tires on the trailer were even balder than those on the truck. One was half flat from the load. It was a good thing that their journey was almost over. </p> <p> Rising in one corner of the trailer, with her elbows resting on the plank siding, was a very pretty girl. She had dark hair pulled tightly behind her head and big brown eyes. She was younger than my mother, but certainly a lot older than I was, and I couldn't help but stare. </p> <p> \"What's your name?\" she said. </p> <p> \"Luke,\" I said, kicking a rock. My cheeks were immediately warm. \"What's yours?\" </p> <p> \"Tally. How old are you?\" </p> <p> \"Seven. How old are you?\" </p> <p> \"Seventeen.\" </p> <p> \"How long you been ridin' in that trailer?\" </p> <p> \"Day and a half.\" </p> <p> She was barefoot, and her dress was dirty and very tight\u2014tight all the way to her knees. This was the first time I remember really examining a girl. She watched me with a knowing smile. A kid sat on a crate next to her with his back to me, and he slowly turned around and looked at me as if I weren't there. He had green eyes and a long forehead covered with sticky black hair. His left arm appeared to be useless. </p> <p> \"This is Trot,\" she said. \"He ain't right.\" </p> <p> \"Nice to meet you, Trot,\" I said, but his eyes looked away. He acted as if he hadn't heard me. </p> <p> \"How old is he?\" I asked her. </p> <p> \"Twelve. He's a cripple.\" </p> <p> Trot turned abruptly to face a corner, his bad arm flopping lifelessly. My friend Dewayne said that hill people married their cousins and that's why there were so many defects in their families. </p> <p> Tally appeared to be perfect, though. She gazed thoughtfully across the cotton fields, and I admired her dirty dress once again. </p> <p> I knew my grandfather and Mr. Spruill had come to terms because Mr. Spruill started his truck. I walked past the trailer, past the man on the tailgate who was briefly awake but still staring at the pavement, and stood beside Pappy. \"Nine miles that way, take a left by a burned-out barn, then six more miles to the St. Francis River. We're the first farm past the river on your left.\" </p> <p> \"Bottomland?\" Mr. Spruill asked, as if he were being sent into a swamp. </p> <p> \"Some of it is, but it's good land.\" </p> <p> Mr. Spruill glanced at his wife again, then looked back at us. \"Where do we set up?\" </p> <p> \"You'll see a shady spot in the back, next to the silo. That's the best place.\" </p> <p> We watched them drive away, the gears rattling, the tires wobbling, crates and boxes and pots bouncing along. </p> <p> \"You don't like them, do you?\" I asked. </p> <p> \"They're good folks. They're just different.\" </p> <p> \"I guess we're lucky to have them, aren't we?\" </p> <p> \"Yes, we are.\" </p> <p> More field hands meant less cotton for me to pick. For the next month I would go to the fields at sunrise, drape a nine-foot cotton sack over my shoulder, and stare for a moment at an endless row of cotton, the stalks taller than I was, then plunge into them, lost as far as anyone could tell. And I would pick cotton, tearing the fluffy bolls from the stalks at a steady pace, stuffing them into the heavy sack, afraid to look down the row and be reminded of how endless it was, afraid to slow down because someone would notice. My fingers would bleed, my neck would burn, my back would hurt. </p> <p> Yes, I wanted lots of help in the fields. Lots of hill people, lots of Mexicans.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The hill people and the Mexicans arrived on the same day. It was a Wednesday, early in September 1952. The Cardinals were five games behind the Dodgers with three weeks to go, and the season looked hopeless. The cotton, however, was waist-high to my father, over my head, and he and my grandfather could be heard before supper whispering words that were seldom heard. It could be a \"good crop.\" They were farmers, hardworking men who embraced pessimism only when discussing the weather and the crops. There was too much sun, or too much rain, or the threat of floods in the lowlands, or the rising prices of seed and fertilizer, or the uncertainties of the markets. On the most perfect of days, my mother would quietly say to me, \"Don't worry. The men will find something to worry about.\" Pappy, my grandfather, was worried about the price for labor when we went searching for the hill people. They were paid for every hundred pounds of cotton they picked. The previous year, according to him, it was $1.50 per hundred. He'd already heard rumors that a farmer over in Lake City was offering $1.60. This played heavily on his mind as we rode to town. He never talked when he drove, and this was because, according to my mother, not much of a driver herself, he was afraid of motorized vehicles. His truck was a 1939 Ford, and with the exception of our old John Deere tractor, it was our sole means of transportation. This was no particular problem except when we drove to church and my mother and grandmother were forced to sit snugly together up front in their Sunday best while my father and I rode in the back, engulfed in dust. Modern sedans were scarce in rural Arkansas. Pappy drove thirty-seven miles per hour. His theory was that every automobile had a speed at which it ran most efficiently, and through some vaguely defined method he had determined that his old truck should go thirty-seven. My mother said (to me) that it was ridiculous. She also said he and my father had once fought over whether the truck should go faster. But my father rarely drove it, and if I happened to be riding with him, he would level off at thirty-seven, out of respect for Pappy. My mother said she suspected he drove much faster when he was alone. We turned onto Highway 135, and, as always, I watched Pappy carefully shift the gears\u2014pressing slowly on the clutch, delicately prodding the stick shift on the steering column\u2014until the truck reached its perfect speed. Then I leaned over to check the speedometer: thirty-seven. He smiled at me as if we both agreed that the truck belonged at that speed. Highway 135 ran straight and flat through the farm country of the Arkansas Delta. On both sides as far as I could see, the fields were white with cotton. It was time for the harvest, a wonderful season for me because they turned out school for two months. For my grandfather, though, it was a time of endless worry. On the right, at the Jordan place, we saw a group of Mexicans working in the field near the road. They were stooped at the waist, their cotton sacks draped behind them, their hands moving deftly through the stalks, tearing off the bolls. Pappy grunted. He didn't like the Jordans because they were Methodists\u2014and Cubs fans. Now that they already had workers in their fields, there was another reason to dislike them. The distance from our farm to town was fewer than eight miles, but at thirty-seven miles an hour, the trip took twenty minutes. Always twenty minutes, even with little traffic. Pappy didn't believe in passing slower vehicles in front of him. Of course, he was usually the slow one. Near Black Oak, we caught up to a trailer filled to the top with snowy mounds of freshly picked cotton. A tarp covered the front half, and the Montgomery twins, who were my age, playfully bounced around in all that cotton until they saw us on the road below them. Then they stopped and waved. I waved back, but my grandfather did not. When he drove, he never waved or nodded at folks, and this was, my mother said, because he was afraid to take his hands from the wheel. She said people talked about him behind his back, saying he was rude and arrogant. Personally, I don't think he cared how the gossip ran. We followed the Montgomery trailer until it turned at the cotton gin. It was pulled by their old Massey Harris tractor, and driven by Frank, the eldest Montgomery boy, who had dropped out of school in the fifth grade and was considered by everyone at church to be headed for serious trouble. Highway 135 became Main Street for the short stretch it took to negotiate Black Oak. We passed the Black Oak Baptist Church, one of the few times we'd pass without stopping for some type of service. Every store, shop, business, church, even the school, faced Main Street, and on Saturdays the traffic inched along, bumper to bumper, as the country folks flocked to town for their weekly shopping. But it was Wednesday, and when we got into town, we parked in front of Pop and Pearl Watson's grocery store on Main. I waited on the sidewalk until my grandfather nodded in the direction of the store. That was my cue to go inside and purchase a Tootsie Roll, on credit. It only cost a penny, but it was not a foregone conclusion that I would get one every trip to town. Occasionally, he wouldn't nod, but I would enter the store anyway and loiter around the cash register long enough for Pearl to sneak me one, which always came with strict instructions not to tell my grandfather.

He would've beaten me with a stick if he knew I had accepted a piece of candy, so Pearl Watson had no trouble swearing me to secrecy. But this time I got the nod. As always, Pearl was dusting the counter when I entered and gave her a stiff hug. Then I grabbed a Tootsie Roll from the jar next to the cash register. I signed the charge slip with great flair, and Pearl inspected my penmanship. \"It's getting better, Luke,\" she said. \"Not bad for a seven-year-old,\" I said. Because of my mother, I had been practicing my name in cursive writing for two years. \"Where's Pop?\" I asked. They were the only adults I knew who insisted I call them by their \"first\" names, but only in the store when no one else was listening. If a customer walked in, then it was suddenly Mr. and Mrs. Watson. I told no one but my mother this, and she told me she was certain no other child held such privilege. \"In the back, putting up stock,\" Pearl said. \"Where's your grandfather?\" It was Pearl's calling in life to monitor the movements of the town's population, so any question was usually answered with another. \"The Tea Shoppe, checking on the Mexicans.

I bit into my Tootsie Roll and chewed it slowly while rewrapping and pocketing the other half. \"Eli's worried about payin' them too much,\" I said. With a customer in the store, Pearl was suddenly busy again, dusting and straightening around the only cash register. \"Eli worries about everything,\" she said. \"He's a farmer.\" \"Are you going to be a farmer?\" \"No ma'am. A baseball player.\" \"For the Cardinals?\" \"Of course.\" Pearl hummed for a bit while I waited for the Mexican. I had some more Spanish I was anxious to try. The old wooden shelves were bursting with fresh groceries. I loved the store during picking season because Pop filled it from floor to ceiling. The crops were coming in, and money was changing hands. Pappy opened the door just wide enough to stick his head in. \"Let's go,\" he said; then, \"Howdy, Pearl.\" \"Howdy, Eli,\" she said as she patted my head and sent me away. \"Where are the Mexicans?\" I asked Pappy when we were outside. \"Should be in later this afternoon.\" We got back in the truck and left town in the direction of Jonesboro, where my grandfather always found the hill people.

We're the first farm past the river on your left.\" \"Bottomland?\" Mr. Spruill asked, as if he were being sent into a swamp. \"Some of it is, but it's good land.\" Mr. Spruill glanced at his wife again, then looked back at us. \"Where do we set up?\" \"You'll see a shady spot in the back, next to the silo. That's the best place.\" We watched them drive away, the gears rattling, the tires wobbling, crates and boxes and pots bouncing along. \"You don't like them, do you?\" I asked. \"They're good folks. They're just different.\" \"I guess we're lucky to have them, aren't we?\" \"Yes, we are.\" More field hands meant less cotton for me to pick. For the next month I would go to the fields at sunrise, drape a nine-foot cotton sack over my shoulder, and stare for a moment at an endless row of cotton, the stalks taller than I was, then plunge into them, lost as far as anyone could tell. And I would pick cotton, tearing the fluffy bolls from the stalks at a steady pace, stuffing them into the heavy sack, afraid to look down the row and be reminded of how endless it was, afraid to slow down because someone would notice. My fingers would bleed, my neck would burn, my back would hurt. Yes, I wanted lots of help in the fields. Lots of hill people, lots of Mexicans.",

Here the troubled country's two leading writers ask how it came to this - and what happens next. David Grossman says the election result shows that Israelis are not ready for peace, while Amos Oz argues that Yasser Arafat is responsible for Sharon's rise to power\n<BR><BR><A HREF=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/\">Special report: Israel and the Middle East</A>",
      "trailText": "David Grossman and Amos Oz on the Israeli election result.",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When Ariel Sharon made his victory speech on Tuesday night, his supporters whistled in contempt and loathing each time their leader mentioned Ehud Barak, the left and the Palestinians. That triad has clearly been punished in the most painful possible way by the Israeli public. As one voter said, in perfect sincerity: \"I'm not sure that Sharon is the best for Israel, but the Palestinians deserve him!\"</p> <p>May I register my suspicion that Sharon himself does not believe what has happened to him? This man, whom many had already written off as a has-been, this power-obsessed, devious extremist of questionable behaviour who has failed in nearly every public office he has held, who has injured nearly everyone who has been his ally, has now been handed an entire country. He can now try out his views, and his instincts, on it. Unlike in the past, this time there is no one, almost, who can stop him. But perhaps that is precisely the reason that in the final days of his campaign, when his victory was already assured, Sharon's mood suddenly changed.</p> <p>Sharon, who has a cynical and ven omous sense of humour, and an almost compulsive urge to crack jokes, looked melancholy and lifeless during the days leading up to the election. One of his associates said: \"It's as if something in him went out.\" At moments, perhaps for the first time in his life, he looked almost frightened.</p> <p>All his life Sharon has operated from the position of the oppositionist, even when he was a cabinet minister. He always, always, challenged the authority of his superiors, both in the army and in the government. A large part of what he did in his military and political careers was done while circumventing authority, disobeying orders, inciting against his leader, and even - as in the case of the Lebanon war - deceiving his superiors.</p> <p>And now, suddenly, at the age of 73, he is himself the superior. He is the authority. He is the man who is responsible for the country. And there is no one to stop him. Now he is prime minister of one of the most complicated countries in the world, deep in the most extremely delicate situation it has seen for decades. Perhaps Sharon knows, deep down in his heart, that if he does indeed mean to ensure his country's future, he will have to abdicate a large number of the opinions and beliefs and symbols that he has valued for the past generation. If he refuses to do so, there can be no doubt that he will lead Israel into a full-frontal collision, not just with the Palestinians, but with the entire Arab world.</p> <p>Maybe that is why Sharon is worried. Paradoxically, this anxiety, and this initial awareness of his true political responsibility and of the complexity of the dilemmas that only a leader is forced to face, are encouraging signs that we can be comforted by (given that there is no other hope).</p> <p>In this context it is interesting to note that, when the right has come to power, there has always been a sense that its leaders do not feel really sure of themselves at the wheel. Something in the rhetoric of Israel's rightwing prime ministers, from Begin to Netanyahu, has continued to be the rhetoric of opposition, of dissent against some lawful regime, even when they themselves were the regime. There were periods during Netanyahu's term, for example, when the government itself behaved as if it were a minority group being persecuted by some wraithlike hostile regime, as if it did not really believe in its own legitimacy.</p> <p>If that turns out to be the situation this time, we will soon witness a dangerous flare-up of Israeli policy. This is liable to be expressed in more aggressive behaviour on the outside, along with contemptuous arrogance towards our neighbours (remember that Sharon instigated the Lebanon war in order to allow the Palestinians to take over Jordan!). This will also inflame the atmosphere within Israel and make its polarisation more severe. Experience of the years when the right ruled tells us to beware of spectacular, extreme acts that are ostensibly full of \"grandeur\" - a magic word for the right wing, a one-word slogan coined by Ze'ev Jabotinsky, the revisionist Zionist leader who was Begin's mentor. In reality, they more often than not take place on the boundary between the grotesque and the catastrophic.</p> <p>The most extreme, fanatical and fundamentalist groups are now returning to the centre of Israel's public stage. The hopes of the moderate, liberal, secular centre to turn Israel into a truly democratic country - less militant in character, more civilian in nature, more egalitarian - have been dealt a resounding blow.</p> <p>Again there is that old, disheartening sense that because of an unfortunate series of events, and because of a harsh and difficult history, Israelis are doomed to run again and again through a time loop, to once again accelerate settlement in the occupied territories and escalate the conflict between us and the countries around us. The rule that all of us know from our most private lives has come true once more: again and again we trip ourselves up precisely in those places where we are most in need of being saved, most in need of a new beginning.</p> <p>Immediately after he was elected - as during his entire campaign - Sharon invited the Labour party to join a national unity government. There can be no doubt that in this he expresses the wishes of many Israelis on both the right and the left who yearn to recreate a sense of partnership and brotherhood that is so lacking in Israel today. It is difficult, however, to see what policies the two parties can unite around. Yet if they do succeed in finding a middle ground between them, Israel will find itself the prisoner of that same familiar tragic error that it has been trapped in for years. Once again Israel will present the Arab world with a position that is a respectable compromise between its centre-right and centre-left blocks. But this compromise will have almost no connection with the demands and troubles and hopes of the Palestinians - that is, no connection with reality. Israel will again conduct virtual negotiations between itself and itself, between itself and its fears. Then it will be surprised, and perhaps feel betrayed, when the Palestinians throw its proposals back in its face while setting off a new intifada.</p> <p>As for the Palestinians, even when they declare that they see no difference between Sharon and Barak, they know very well how big the gap between the two is, and what the consequences will be. For that reason, apparently, they began, in the two weeks leading up to the elections, to gallop towards a compromise with Israel at the Taba talks. Too bad that this zeal was not evident a few weeks, or even months, earlier. It is also unfortunate that Arafat did not succeed in controlling his people and in channelling the authentic energy of the beginning of the intifada into a momentum for reaching an accord while Barak was in power. Dozens of innocent Israeli men, women and children were murdered by Palestinian terrorists during the election campaign. Each funeral, each orphan's tear, \"proved\" to the Israeli public that Barak had erred in agreeing to compromises. The public was pushed towards the man who promised them that he would not negotiate under fire. The despair and anxiety that possessed the Israeli public - and the total lack of awareness of Palestinian pain and suffering - are what has put Sharon in power. Paradoxically, the anxiety and despair are liable to bring about their own realisation.</p> <p>The obvious conclusion from these elections is that the Israeli public is not yet ready for peace. Israelis want peace, of course, but they are not yet able to pay the heavy price that such an agreement requires. On the other side are the Palestinians, and they also, apparently, have not yet internalised the need for the painful compromises that peace requires. It is hard to see how we can get out of this dead end without another round of bloodshed.</p> <p>Fairness requires that we give Sharon a chance to prove that he is right. There is a heavy feeling in my heart. Just writing this pains me - it is one thing to report on a train running off the tracks from a vantage point to the side.

Violence, so the Palestinian hardliners reckoned, would cajole Barak to use force, and thus lose favour with the international community. Violence would also make the Israelis desperate and push them into electing an extremist government.

      "bodyText": "When Ariel Sharon made his victory speech on Tuesday night, his supporters whistled in contempt and loathing each time their leader mentioned Ehud Barak, the left and the Palestinians. That triad has clearly been punished in the most painful possible way by the Israeli public. As one voter said, in perfect sincerity: \"I'm not sure that Sharon is the best for Israel, but the Palestinians deserve him!\" May I register my suspicion that Sharon himself does not believe what has happened to him? This man, whom many had already written off as a has-been, this power-obsessed, devious extremist of questionable behaviour who has failed in nearly every public office he has held, who has injured nearly everyone who has been his ally, has now been handed an entire country. He can now try out his views, and his instincts, on it. Unlike in the past, this time there is no one, almost, who can stop him. But perhaps that is precisely the reason that in the final days of his campaign, when his victory was already assured, Sharon's mood suddenly changed. Sharon, who has a cynical and ven omous sense of humour, and an almost compulsive urge to crack jokes, looked melancholy and lifeless during the days leading up to the election. One of his associates said: \"It's as if something in him went out.\" At moments, perhaps for the first time in his life, he looked almost frightened. All his life Sharon has operated from the position of the oppositionist, even when he was a cabinet minister. He always, always, challenged the authority of his superiors, both in the army and in the government. A large part of what he did in his military and political careers was done while circumventing authority, disobeying orders, inciting against his leader, and even - as in the case of the Lebanon war - deceiving his superiors. And now, suddenly, at the age of 73, he is himself the superior. He is the authority. He is the man who is responsible for the country. And there is no one to stop him. Now he is prime minister of one of the most complicated countries in the world, deep in the most extremely delicate situation it has seen for decades. Perhaps Sharon knows, deep down in his heart, that if he does indeed mean to ensure his country's future, he will have to abdicate a large number of the opinions and beliefs and symbols that he has valued for the past generation. If he refuses to do so, there can be no doubt that he will lead Israel into a full-frontal collision, not just with the Palestinians, but with the entire Arab world. Maybe that is why Sharon is worried. Paradoxically, this anxiety, and this initial awareness of his true political responsibility and of the complexity of the dilemmas that only a leader is forced to face, are encouraging signs that we can be comforted by (given that there is no other hope). In this context it is interesting to note that, when the right has come to power, there has always been a sense that its leaders do not feel really sure of themselves at the wheel. Something in the rhetoric of Israel's rightwing prime ministers, from Begin to Netanyahu, has continued to be the rhetoric of opposition, of dissent against some lawful regime, even when they themselves were the regime. There were periods during Netanyahu's term, for example, when the government itself behaved as if it were a minority group being persecuted by some wraithlike hostile regime, as if it did not really believe in its own legitimacy. If that turns out to be the situation this time, we will soon witness a dangerous flare-up of Israeli policy. This is liable to be expressed in more aggressive behaviour on the outside, along with contemptuous arrogance towards our neighbours (remember that Sharon instigated the Lebanon war in order to allow the Palestinians to take over Jordan!). This will also inflame the atmosphere within Israel and make its polarisation more severe. Experience of the years when the right ruled tells us to beware of spectacular, extreme acts that are ostensibly full of \"grandeur\" - a magic word for the right wing, a one-word slogan coined by Ze'ev Jabotinsky, the revisionist Zionist leader who was Begin's mentor. In reality, they more often than not take place on the boundary between the grotesque and the catastrophic. The most extreme, fanatical and fundamentalist groups are now returning to the centre of Israel's public stage. The hopes of the moderate, liberal, secular centre to turn Israel into a truly democratic country - less militant in character, more civilian in nature, more egalitarian - have been dealt a resounding blow. Again there is that old, disheartening sense that because of an unfortunate series of events, and because of a harsh and difficult history, Israelis are doomed to run again and again through a time loop, to once again accelerate settlement in the occupied territories and escalate the conflict between us and the countries around us. The rule that all of us know from our most private lives has come true once more: again and again we trip ourselves up precisely in those places where we are most in need of being saved, most in need of a new beginning. Immediately after he was elected - as during his entire campaign - Sharon invited the Labour party to join a national unity government. There can be no doubt that in this he expresses the wishes of many Israelis on both the right and the left who yearn to recreate a sense of partnership and brotherhood that is so lacking in Israel today. It is difficult, however, to see what policies the two parties can unite around. Yet if they do succeed in finding a middle ground between them, Israel will find itself the prisoner of that same familiar tragic error that it has been trapped in for years. Once again Israel will present the Arab world with a position that is a respectable compromise between its centre-right and centre-left blocks.

Asked if this meant he was involved in talks, he replied: \"I didn't say that.\" Even if the Premier League and its 22 club chairmen manage to secure a deal, it will be far below the \u00a3328m originally offered by NTL. The choice of games will also be limited. The winner of the PPV licence will only be able to select its match after BSkyB, which paid \u00a31.2bn for the broadcasting rights. A Premier League spokesman could not confirm when a deal would be signed but said negotiations were continuing. \"We are still in detailed negotiations. \"A deal will be concluded as soon as the broadcasting team makes its recommendation to the club chairmen,\" said the spokesman.",

However, BT executives today insisted that the flotation of its mobile phone division remained the cornerstone of the company's debt reduction strategy.

The France Telecom-owned company has been forced to slash its valuation by \u00a36.4bn, as sceptical investors balk at investing in a debt-laden sector. But BT chief executive Peter Bonfield said he still expected the flotation to go ahead, and that other debt reduction strategies will cut BT's deficit to \u00a320bn by year end.

      "bodyText": "After 12 months of sitting on its hands, the Bank of England's monetary policy committee has finally cut interest rates. The decision to reduce borrowing costs by 0.25% to 5.75% was widely expected by City analysts who are predicting further rate cuts in the months ahead. Today's move by the Bank was probably a response to worries about the rapid cooling in the American economy - although we will not know for sure until the minutes of the meeting are released in two weeks time. Growth in the world's largest economy has slowed to zero, according to the chairman of the US federal reserve, Alan Greenspan. Threadneedle Street fears that a US recession could spread across the Atlantic to Britain because of close investment and trade links between the two economies. As yet, there are few signs of a slowdown in Britain. Although growth slowed to its slowest pace in two years in the last quarter of 2000, one off factors like the chaos on the railways and a sharp drop in energy consumption and extraction are to blame. Consumer spending has yet to slow significantly and even the manufacturing sector is still showing signs of life. So why did the Bank move now, rather than wait until there definite signs that the British economy is catching a chill from America? According to Ciaran Barr, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, the MPC's philosophy today was a stitch in time saves nine. \"By cutting early, and arguably proactively, the MPC may ultimately reduce the amount of cuts needed,\" he said. The Bank has plenty of room to manoeuvre - inflation has been under the government 2.5% target for 22 months and some economist predict it could fall as low as 1.5% later this year. Finally, there is the political dimension. Although the minutes will almost certainly make no mention of it, the MPC's next meeting comes hard on the heels of the likely date of Gordon Brown's budget, while the one after could well be in the middle of the election campaign. Cutting rates over the next few months therefore risks looking like a political move - either an endorsement of the Budget or a boost to the government ahead of the election - and the Bank cannot afford to have its reputation for independence compromised. Moving early avoids the problem.

      "bodyText": "The BBC has confirmed that cable TV company NTL is the corporation's \"preferred partner\" for a planned sports channel. A BBC spokesman said that any deal had \"a long way to go\". But he added: \"We are making progress on discussions.\" Director-general Greg Dyke last week admitted he was looking into launching a pay channel as part of his drive to boost its beleaguered sports department. He has decided to pursue the pay-television strategy because the corporation cannot compete with the chequebooks of Rupert Murdoch's Sky TV and ITV bosses who last year dealt a devastating blow to the corporation by snatching the rights to Premier League football highlights. The idea was first mooted by Mr Dyke's predecessor Lord Birt two years ago when it seemed that the BBC's sports department - then under the stewardship of the much-criticised Mike Miller - could never recover from the relentless loss of sports events to rivals. The channel would be used as a \"spillover\" service, offering viewers a chance to see sports such as minor Wimbledon matches which could not be fitted into BBC1 and BBC2 schedules. BBC bosses already have an alliance with NTL - they have a \u00a324m four-year deal to show rugby union's European Cup and they have also clinched a deal to screen the BBC's considerable archive. They also joined forces last year in a \u00a310m deal to produce NTL's pay-per-view football matches although this has collapsed following the cable giant's decision to pull out of the \u00a3327m deal with the Premier League. Rivals, however, today expressed surprise that the BBC could be on the verge of any deal. \"They have been talking to everyone. They are basically trying to find something for their presentation team to do. Once the Premiership goes people like John Motson and Gary Lineker will find themselves under-occupied,\" said one pay-TV executive. \"I can't see what the BBC will screen on the channel. They simply don't have enough to make a sports channel attractive enough to compete with Sky Sports.\" The deal, however, could entail BBC involvement in British Eurosport, which is part-owned by NTL. And the BBC may yet secure rights to car rallying - it is currently in head-to-head competition for the TV rights with Channel 4, which also plans a sports channel. The corporation is virtually certain to secure rights to top horse-racing events as part of the Go Racing deal with the Racecourse Association. An alliance with NTL would set the corporation on a war footing with BSkyB, which will do everything in its power to strangle the competition at birth. A BBC-backed sports channel would face fierce opposition from commercial broadcasters, who object to the BBC cross-fertilising its commercial activities with licence-fee funded material. NTL's bid to screen pay-per-view Premier League football collapsed last year amid doubts that the company could make back the \u00a3328m it spent on the rights.

Mr Kenyon will pose as a wedding photographer and will snap a variety of sham marriages, including one in which a groom is unable to remember the name of his bride. This subject was once explored by Mr MacIntyre as an undercover reporter on World in Action. A spokeswoman said the series would be \"almost funny and sometimes cringey\". The programme is to air on Monday nights at 7.30pm. The ratings for the BBC's flagship current affairs programme Panorama are in decline. Last year, the programme was moved from its Monday night slot to Sunday evenings, prompting accusations of dumbing down. Since the move, the show has struggled to attract more than 3m.",

But ministers have moved to address critics' concerns by promising to work with doctors and patient groups to ensure the powers - described as \"Orwellian\" by critics - are properly regulated to prevent abuses. Clause 59 of the bill, which was passed by a Labour-dominated scrutiny committee today, will enable the health secretary to approve disclosure of confidential patient information where it is in the public interest. The British Medical Association had warned that it was unhappy that the bill would give \"sweeping\" new powers to the minister, and called for restrictions and safeguards to ensure the power is not abused. Ministers believe the clause will safeguard essential \"public interest\" medical work in areas such as cancer research which requires the use confidential patient information. Health minister John Denham said he would work closely with professional bodies to ensure adequate safeguards are drawn up to guarantee applications for use of patient information are rigorously tested, and scrutinised in parliament. The bill has completed its committee stage. It moves on to report stage and third reading next week before going to the House of Lords. Mr Denham said: \"While the government believes informed consent for the use of confidential patient information should be obtained wherever possible, there are some situations where obtaining informed consent proves impractical and sometimes cannot be done. \"The bill will ensure that doctors can share patient information in such circumstances, if doing so will benefit patients and the public. \"Our prime objective is to safeguard existing practices, for example, cancer registries, which help to develop more effective treatments for cancer.\" \"Confidential patient information should only be used where there is a real need and where it is clearly in the interests of patients and the public, and critically, only when there is no reasonable, practicable alternative.\" Mr Denham said the proposed powers had the backing of the data protection commissioner, on the grounds that it would protect the interests of patients.

As the television B-list rubbed shoulders with the royal A-list, Prince William stepped into the bear-pit called the Press Complaints' Commission 10th anniversary party for his first public engagement. Entering the ornate Silver Gallery at Somerset House in London, the prince made for Christopher Livesey, the subject of a PCC ruling when he was 15. His local paper in Accrington, Lancashire, had breached the editor's code by interviewing him without the permission of his parents. The PCC chairman, Lord Wakeham, had said in a speech to newspaper editors: \"What goes for a child in Accrington goes for a child in Eton.\" The prince has moved on from his school days and is preparing for life at St Andrews, while Mr Livesey is a student at Liverpool Metropolitan University.

The strangest sight was Camilla Parker Bowles leading Joanna Lumley through half the cast of Coronation Street to meet William Hague and Sebastian Coe - stopping off via Richard Branson. Or perhaps it was Mrs Parker Bowles deep in conversation with the Mirror editor Piers Morgan: \"We come from the same town,\" he said excitedly. Also odd to behold was Andrew Neil accosting Prince William to talk about the delights of St Andrews, where the newspaper publisher is rector. Prince William seemed to take it all in his stride, despite being forced to make small talk with the unlikeliest of stars - to John Savident, yet another escapee from the Coronation Street, he quipped: \"I watch EastEnders.\" He was clearly more at home discussing the merits of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels with Vinnie Jones; and to a glamorous Radio 1 producer, he declared his enthusiasm for DJs Sara Cox and Chris Moyles.

This is invariably the sign of a black sheep. </p> <p>Turn Albert's face to the wall, mother </p> <p>Never more mention his name </p> <p>He brought disgrace on our family </p> <p>And put us all to shame </p> <p>Not, however, in Pamela's case. Pamela never did anything wrong. Pamela never did anything much. Her obituary writer - who showed signs of pumping away with his foot to keep afloat - said that she was well known in the poultry world; notably for introducing the Appenzeller Spitzhaube chicken to Britain, a bird which wears, like a cocktail hat, a rather charming arrangement of feathers on its head. </p> <p>Chickens loom large in the Mitford story. Lord Redesdale set his face like stone against educating his daughters, having heard that hockey overdeveloped the calves, so Lady Redesdale kept chickens and, with the slender profits from the eggs, hired governesses. Also slender, you suspect. </p> <p>Lady Redesdale said that whenever she saw a newspaper placard which began \"Peer's daughter...\", she knew it would be one of hers. She also knew it would not be Pam. In a flock of black sheep, Pam was the baa lamb. She was, of course, not even mentioned in <strong> The Big Tease</strong> (Omnibus, BBC2), a no-expense-incurred biography of Nancy Mitford, supporting the current run of Love In A Cold Climate. You could just smell the Chanel and the horses. </p> <p>Nancy's surviving sisters, Diana, Lady Mosley and Deborah, Duchess of Devonshire, appeared as witnesses for - it is hard to be sure - either the defence or the prosecution. </p> <p>Diana: \"I think Nancy was the most disloyal person I've ever met in my life. Of course, that was what made her such fun.\" </p> <p>Deborah: \"She was a wicked tease - cruel sometimes. She said I never learned to read and had to point with one finger. Perfectly true. She used to say that my mental age was nine. Also perfectly true, but it didn't go down very well at the time.\" Unless, of course, she was nine at the time. </p> <p>All the Mitford girls headed like heat-seeking missiles for high-flying men: Unity was besotted with Hitler; Diana married Oswald Mosley; Jessica ran away with a communist to fight in Spain; Deborah got her duke; and Nancy fell hopelessly in love with a Frenchman, who did not love her. \"He was hugely oversexed and incredibly ugly - horrible spots, angry ones, terrible tiny little wisps of smoke coming out of them,\" erupted Lord Norwich, emitting wisps of smoke himself. </p> <p>She moved to France to be near him and contracted cancer a month after reading of his engagement. It was Pamela who nursed her. \"She was perfect by herself. The only thing that went wrong in Nancy's life was the men in it. They were hopeless,\" said Diana, and lowered her beautiful eyelids. </p> <p>The success of a detective series depends on the power generated by the detective. You are rarely tempted to take up the job. Sherlock Holmes, inspecting the inside of his squalid hat, would deduce correctly that he was a stranger to dry cleaning, drank to forget and was programmed to self-destruct. Pat Chappel (Ken Stott) in <strong> The Vice</strong> (ITV) is scruffy, five o'clock shadowy, bulbous and in love with a prostitute. He will do nicely. </p> <p>In the last of the current series Vickers (Tim Piggot-Smith at his most heh, heh, heh) was running orgies for businessmen, which seemed to involve waitresses nervously offering strawberries in their teeth. I would have thought Environmental Health could have closed this down without recourse to Vice, but Chappel arranged a far more dramatic denouement. My own view is that anyone who trusts an informer called Damon needs their bumps felt. </p> <p>The unexpectedly gripping thing about <strong> Position Impossible: In Search Of The Kama Sutra</strong> (Channel 4) was why the man in the helpful illustrations wore a rather dashing red hat throughout his exertions. In the west, it is considered polite to remove your hat. Before it falls off. You could, if well disposed, put the whole thing down to enthusiasm, like the Duchess of Marlborough, who recorded that \"His Grace returned from the wars this morning and pleasured me twice in his top boots.\" But surely not in his top hat?</p>",

Nancy's surviving sisters, Diana, Lady Mosley and Deborah, Duchess of Devonshire, appeared as witnesses for - it is hard to be sure - either the defence or the prosecution. Diana: \"I think Nancy was the most disloyal person I've ever met in my life. Of course, that was what made her such fun.\" Deborah: \"She was a wicked tease - cruel sometimes. She said I never learned to read and had to point with one finger. Perfectly true. She used to say that my mental age was nine. Also perfectly true, but it didn't go down very well at the time.\" Unless, of course, she was nine at the time. All the Mitford girls headed like heat-seeking missiles for high-flying men: Unity was besotted with Hitler; Diana married Oswald Mosley; Jessica ran away with a communist to fight in Spain; Deborah got her duke; and Nancy fell hopelessly in love with a Frenchman, who did not love her. \"He was hugely oversexed and incredibly ugly - horrible spots, angry ones, terrible tiny little wisps of smoke coming out of them,\" erupted Lord Norwich, emitting wisps of smoke himself. She moved to France to be near him and contracted cancer a month after reading of his engagement. It was Pamela who nursed her. \"She was perfect by herself. The only thing that went wrong in Nancy's life was the men in it. They were hopeless,\" said Diana, and lowered her beautiful eyelids. The success of a detective series depends on the power generated by the detective. You are rarely tempted to take up the job. Sherlock Holmes, inspecting the inside of his squalid hat, would deduce correctly that he was a stranger to dry cleaning, drank to forget and was programmed to self-destruct. Pat Chappel (Ken Stott) in The Vice (ITV) is scruffy, five o'clock shadowy, bulbous and in love with a prostitute. He will do nicely. In the last of the current series Vickers (Tim Piggot-Smith at his most heh, heh, heh) was running orgies for businessmen, which seemed to involve waitresses nervously offering strawberries in their teeth. I would have thought Environmental Health could have closed this down without recourse to Vice, but Chappel arranged a far more dramatic denouement. My own view is that anyone who trusts an informer called Damon needs their bumps felt. The unexpectedly gripping thing about Position Impossible: In Search Of The Kama Sutra (Channel 4) was why the man in the helpful illustrations wore a rather dashing red hat throughout his exertions. In the west, it is considered polite to remove your hat. Before it falls off. You could, if well disposed, put the whole thing down to enthusiasm, like the Duchess of Marlborough, who recorded that \"His Grace returned from the wars this morning and pleasured me twice in his top boots.\" But surely not in his top hat?",

With concern growing about the rapid decline of the Ancoats area, which contains seven grade II* listed buildings and a clutch of early 19th century cotton mills, the North West Development Agency has threatened around 100 owners with compulsory purchase orders. The exercise could cost it \u00a310m. In one of the largest exercises of its type in a British city, the agency said it had been forced to act to prevent a crucial 20 acres, barely half a mile from the centre of Manchester, \"sinking into oblivion\". Fears are growing that some owners are holding on to key sites and buildings in the hope of making a quick killing as land appreciates in value on the back of nearby developments. Manchester city centre, which housed only a few hundred people 10 years ago, now has a population approaching 10,000 with a few penthouses fetching \u00a31m. But so far the wealth has failed to trickle down to the Ancoats district, which has been earmarked for redevelopment by an urban village company, backed by the development agency and the city council. It is labelled the world's first industrial suburb, and its oldest cotton mill dates back to 1798, while many of its successors pioneered mass production with steam-driven spinning techniques. While a few buildings have been transformed into new workshops and cafes, the village company says scores of others can be converted into mixed use embracing flats and offices. Only 400 people now live in the area, although planners hope it will eventually accommodate 3,000, with new schools and health centres. But Lyn Fenton, the company's chief executive, said the company was determined to ensure that new housing went to people on lower incomes to create an inclusive community. \"We would be very disappointed if we ended up with only high-priced apartments, because higher earners are already catered for in the city.\" While land in Manchester city centre is going for up to \u00a37m an acre, prices - so far - are much more depressed in the Ancoats area.

      "bodyText": "Labour leaders have added Hartlepool to a list of constituencies considered vulnerable to a Tory surge at the election amid fears that the controversy engulfing Peter Mandelson could undermine support for the party. Officials in Labour's northern region have agreed to channel extra resources into Hartlepool, including activists from neighbouring constituencies, to bolster Mr Mandelson's position during the campaign. The former cabinet minister had a 17,508 majority in 1997, which on paper would make it a safe seat, but the party's northern executive is worried there could be a backlash against him after his second spectacular resignation. Hartlepool, Labour for more than quarter of a century, is one of four constituencies out of 28 held by the government in north-east England on an \"at risk\" list. Embarrassingly for Mr Mandelson, the other three were all won from the Conservatives at the last election - Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, Stockton South, and Tynemouth. \"Hartlepool was recognised as a special case before the recent shenanigans,\" said a Blairite MP in the region. \"Peter's always polarised people.

Miners' leader Arthur Scargill and a fuel protester have already announced they will stand in a contest likely to turn into a political circus as fringe candidates are attracted by the media spotlight. A number of allies of Mr Mandelson, forced to quit the cabinet a second time last month over the Hinduja passport affair, believe he should quit Hartlepool and politics. The former Ulster secretary, however, has declared his intention to use Sir Anthony Hammond's inquiry to counter allegations he lied over Srichand Hinduja's passport application and stand again in Hartlepool where senior figures in the constituency Labour party have continued to back him. A local poll at the weekend found a majority of people in the seat thought he should step down. Harry Blackwood, editor of the town's evening newspaper, the Hartlepool Mail, recently wrote that Mr Mandelson was viewed by locals as an \"absent MP\" who neglected the constituency. \"In a town where it was said that you could pin a Labour rosette on a monkey and people would vote for it, things have changed,\" said Mr Blackwood. \"Hartlepool voters got rid of the Labour controlled council in last May's elections after 22 years in charge, and they could turn against Mandelson in the same way.\" Cartoon 30.01.2001: Steve Bell on Labour's reaction to Mandelson's resignation Steve Bell on life without Peter Mandelson Related articles 30.01.2001: It was Alastair Campbell who led an iniquitous panic 30.01.2001: MI6 drawn into Hinduja passport row 30.01.2001: A Whitehall farce 29.01.2001: Cabinet cuts off Mandelson 29.01.2001, analysis: How Mandelson and Campbell came to blows 29.01.2001, analysis: 'I think Peter has been slightly detached' 29.01.2001: Brother deals new blow to Vaz 29.01.2001, leader: Spinning out of control 29.01.2001, Roy Hattersley: Why the passing of Peter isn't very important 28.01.2001, Andrew Rawnsley: Why he really had to go 25.01.2001: A glittering career in ruins 25.01.2001, Benjamin Wegg-Prosser: I'm Mandy, fire me Audio 24.01.2001: Peter Mandelson's resignation statement Photo gallery Peter Mandelson: a life in pictures B&gt;The 1998 home loan row Text of resignation letter 24.12.1998: Mandelson, the minister and the \u00a3373,000 loan 24.12.1998: Mandelson: undone by a story that could not be done Andrew Rawnsley: inside New Labour Mandelson resigns over his home loan Rivals in the Labour party How Mandy replaced Mo Talk about it Have your say on the Mandelson affair Useful links Peter Mandelson: Why I had to go - Sunday Times, 28.01.2001 24.01.2001: Full text of Mandelson's resignation statement Hinduja group history Downing Street press briefing Hartlepool Mail",

      "byline": "Martin Woollacott",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>As the invasion of Lebanon in 1982 dragged Israel deeper and deeper into a profitless war, one minister asked his fellow cabinet members, referring to Ariel Sharon, then minister of defence, \"Why have we put an elephant in charge of all this?\" The objections to Sharon have always been not only to his politics but to his unstable, overweening and impulsive character. The question might well be asked again today, not that much short of 20 years later, after Israelis have made him not just a minister, but prime minister, at such a critical time for their country.</p> <p>It is a perplexing choice, since Sharon is capable of delivering neither peace nor security to his fellow citizens, and might make some volatile decision which would endanger what is left of both. But it is one which symbolises the fact that the whole of the Middle East is entering an era of perplexity. The mood in Middle Eastern capitals on \"the day after\", which is what the Israelis weeks ago christened the morrow of Sharon's unavoidable victory, is not angry, not warlike and not, or not yet, particularly apprehensive, but above all puzzled. Of course this perplexity is not absolutely new. It has been growing ever since the second Palestinian intifada began, after the failure of the Camp David talks last year.</p> <p>But Sharon's actual arrival in power emphasises that political purpose has nowhere to go and policy no hook on which to hang. The scaffolding which for at least a decade has kept regional politics in balance, however imperfectly, is damaged and already partly collapsed. That applies above all to the Oslo process, which every government and significant movement in the Middle East used in diverse ways. Whether you supported Oslo, sought to modify it or opposed it, it provided a justification for power, a field of action for policy and, because it was ongoing, you could always appeal to the future when under attack by critics.</p> <p>That, perhaps, is what Yasser Arafat meant when he said in London three years ago that the alternative to Oslo was \"chaos\" - not so much that without Oslo there would be immediate mayhem as that nobody would know what to do any longer. And it may well be one reason, apart from the desire to upstage Sharon by acting more apparently reasonably, that yesterday he was mysteriously ready to look forward to the continuation of the peace process.</p> <p>But Oslo is not the only part of the framework of action in the region that has been weakened. The attempt to contain Iraq - half success, half failure - has been in trouble for some time. Whether it will be revived in a more than rhetorical way by the new American administration is unclear, still less whether the US will take serious covert action aimed at unseating Saddam. Again, this half success was, like Oslo, something on which governments could count, whatever they actually thought of the policy.</p> <p>In Iran, what had appeared to some to be an unstoppable movement toward reform, a movement expected to ultimately lead to Iran's full rehabilitation and to better relations with western countries, has faltered. Recent verdicts in the Iranian courts have condemned Iranian intelligence agents for the murder of intellectuals but blocked further inquiry into who among the Iranian establishment inspired them to these crimes. In a process of judicial regression, these have been followed by more hostile verdicts against journalists and newspapers. As Geneive Abdo wrote, after having to leave Iran this week, the reform wing in Iran seems in retrospect to have provided cover for the right rather than to have truly opposed it.</p> <p>In any case, Iran, in the light of these new, less hopeful developments, has become a more uncertain factor in the region than before. Although not at all of the same order, recent difficulties between Turkey, Europe, and the US add to the general uncertainty. Finally, there have been increases in oil prices and could be more to come and, to all this, the Bush administration brings its own quota of uncertainty. It has yet to reveal, or perhaps even to formulate, its key policies in the Middle East.</p> <p>A year or so ago the Middle East had a number of \"destinations\", movement toward which was assumed as a matter of practical politics and diplomacy, even if there were many private doubts. These included an Israeli-Palestinian settlement; peace between Israel and Syria; an end to Saddam's time in Iraq without him being able to wholly break out of his isolation; the gradually achieved ascendancy of the reformers in Iran; and closer relations between Turkey and Europe, including rapprochement with Greece. All but the last are now in much doubt. These different movements would, optimists hoped, to some extent reinforce each other. If we are still going to these places it is far less easy to say how we are going to get there.</p> <p>S haron certainly has no answers to the questions before Israel. In part, he represents that side of Israeli politics which is like a long wrestling contest, with the heavyweights of a certain generation returning again and again to the ring in pursuit of prizes. Sharon has now won the crown which has eluded Shimon Peres. But he has no plans. The time when he had plans was 20 years ago, when he had grandiose schemes to re-engineer the Middle East.</p> <p>Jordan was to lose its royal family, become the Palestinian state and take in the Arabs of the West Bank and perhaps of Israel proper as well. Lebanon would be a Christian-dominated client state, purged of Palestinians; Iran and Turkey allies; Syria neutralised; Egypt neutered. It was a time of quite unrealistic Israeli imperial ambitions and Sharon was the most unrealistic of them all. The war he hustled to prosecute brought the opposite of what he had intended. He struck at what he called \"the snake's head\" of the PLO leadership, and did indeed get it out of Lebanon - but only to live to fight another day and return to Palestine after the first intifada had helped lead to Oslo.</p> <p>Sharon is an old man with no solutions, not even the solution of war. He can make life more difficult for the Palestinians, but it is hard to see how very much more miserable that could be. He has learned enough in the years since Lebanon to know that a general conflict with the Arab states, which in any case they would be exceedingly reluctant to undertake, however provoked, would solve nothing. In any case, his election does not at all ease Israel's political paralysis and general elections may not be far away. They might bring Binyamin Netanyahu to power - but he too has no solutions. The problem with which the failure of Camp David brought Israel face to face is that nobody wants war but few are ready to pay the price for peace. Choosing has-beens as leaders, meanwhile, is not so much politics as a displacement activity.</p> <p>Yasser Arafat is another old man who cannot square the circle. His sharp political instincts tell him how far he can run ahead of his people and he rarely exceeds that limit. His experience also tells him that waiting often pays off, events are unpredictable and opportunities do sometimes reoccur.

      "bodyText": "As the invasion of Lebanon in 1982 dragged Israel deeper and deeper into a profitless war, one minister asked his fellow cabinet members, referring to Ariel Sharon, then minister of defence, \"Why have we put an elephant in charge of all this?\" The objections to Sharon have always been not only to his politics but to his unstable, overweening and impulsive character. The question might well be asked again today, not that much short of 20 years later, after Israelis have made him not just a minister, but prime minister, at such a critical time for their country. It is a perplexing choice, since Sharon is capable of delivering neither peace nor security to his fellow citizens, and might make some volatile decision which would endanger what is left of both. But it is one which symbolises the fact that the whole of the Middle East is entering an era of perplexity. The mood in Middle Eastern capitals on \"the day after\", which is what the Israelis weeks ago christened the morrow of Sharon's unavoidable victory, is not angry, not warlike and not, or not yet, particularly apprehensive, but above all puzzled. Of course this perplexity is not absolutely new. It has been growing ever since the second Palestinian intifada began, after the failure of the Camp David talks last year. But Sharon's actual arrival in power emphasises that political purpose has nowhere to go and policy no hook on which to hang. The scaffolding which for at least a decade has kept regional politics in balance, however imperfectly, is damaged and already partly collapsed. That applies above all to the Oslo process, which every government and significant movement in the Middle East used in diverse ways. Whether you supported Oslo, sought to modify it or opposed it, it provided a justification for power, a field of action for policy and, because it was ongoing, you could always appeal to the future when under attack by critics. That, perhaps, is what Yasser Arafat meant when he said in London three years ago that the alternative to Oslo was \"chaos\" - not so much that without Oslo there would be immediate mayhem as that nobody would know what to do any longer. And it may well be one reason, apart from the desire to upstage Sharon by acting more apparently reasonably, that yesterday he was mysteriously ready to look forward to the continuation of the peace process. But Oslo is not the only part of the framework of action in the region that has been weakened. The attempt to contain Iraq - half success, half failure - has been in trouble for some time. Whether it will be revived in a more than rhetorical way by the new American administration is unclear, still less whether the US will take serious covert action aimed at unseating Saddam. Again, this half success was, like Oslo, something on which governments could count, whatever they actually thought of the policy. In Iran, what had appeared to some to be an unstoppable movement toward reform, a movement expected to ultimately lead to Iran's full rehabilitation and to better relations with western countries, has faltered. Recent verdicts in the Iranian courts have condemned Iranian intelligence agents for the murder of intellectuals but blocked further inquiry into who among the Iranian establishment inspired them to these crimes. In a process of judicial regression, these have been followed by more hostile verdicts against journalists and newspapers. As Geneive Abdo wrote, after having to leave Iran this week, the reform wing in Iran seems in retrospect to have provided cover for the right rather than to have truly opposed it. In any case, Iran, in the light of these new, less hopeful developments, has become a more uncertain factor in the region than before. Although not at all of the same order, recent difficulties between Turkey, Europe, and the US add to the general uncertainty. Finally, there have been increases in oil prices and could be more to come and, to all this, the Bush administration brings its own quota of uncertainty. It has yet to reveal, or perhaps even to formulate, its key policies in the Middle East. A year or so ago the Middle East had a number of \"destinations\", movement toward which was assumed as a matter of practical politics and diplomacy, even if there were many private doubts. These included an Israeli-Palestinian settlement; peace between Israel and Syria; an end to Saddam's time in Iraq without him being able to wholly break out of his isolation; the gradually achieved ascendancy of the reformers in Iran; and closer relations between Turkey and Europe, including rapprochement with Greece. All but the last are now in much doubt. These different movements would, optimists hoped, to some extent reinforce each other. If we are still going to these places it is far less easy to say how we are going to get there. S haron certainly has no answers to the questions before Israel. In part, he represents that side of Israeli politics which is like a long wrestling contest, with the heavyweights of a certain generation returning again and again to the ring in pursuit of prizes. Sharon has now won the crown which has eluded Shimon Peres. But he has no plans. The time when he had plans was 20 years ago, when he had grandiose schemes to re-engineer the Middle East. Jordan was to lose its royal family, become the Palestinian state and take in the Arabs of the West Bank and perhaps of Israel proper as well. Lebanon would be a Christian-dominated client state, purged of Palestinians; Iran and Turkey allies; Syria neutralised; Egypt neutered. It was a time of quite unrealistic Israeli imperial ambitions and Sharon was the most unrealistic of them all. The war he hustled to prosecute brought the opposite of what he had intended. He struck at what he called \"the snake's head\" of the PLO leadership, and did indeed get it out of Lebanon - but only to live to fight another day and return to Palestine after the first intifada had helped lead to Oslo. Sharon is an old man with no solutions, not even the solution of war. He can make life more difficult for the Palestinians, but it is hard to see how very much more miserable that could be. He has learned enough in the years since Lebanon to know that a general conflict with the Arab states, which in any case they would be exceedingly reluctant to undertake, however provoked, would solve nothing. In any case, his election does not at all ease Israel's political paralysis and general elections may not be far away. They might bring Binyamin Netanyahu to power - but he too has no solutions. The problem with which the failure of Camp David brought Israel face to face is that nobody wants war but few are ready to pay the price for peace. Choosing has-beens as leaders, meanwhile, is not so much politics as a displacement activity. Yasser Arafat is another old man who cannot square the circle. His sharp political instincts tell him how far he can run ahead of his people and he rarely exceeds that limit. His experience also tells him that waiting often pays off, events are unpredictable and opportunities do sometimes reoccur. He was wise enough to warn the Americans that the time was not ripe for a final settlement, that it would be impossible to reach and that the Palestinians would be blamed. He will wait on events, as will leaders throughout the Middle East. It is a sad condition for a region in which the desire for a normal, modern life is so apparent everywhere, if strangely mixed with attitudes that make such a life so difficult to achieve. martin.woollacott@theguardian.com Election results Related articles 07.02.2001, world dispatch: Sharon has a mountain to climb 07.02.2001: World offers Sharon a wary welcome 07.02.2001, comment: Despair as usual for Palestinians 07.02.2001: What the Israeli papers say 07.02.2001: End of road for humiliated Barak 07.02.2001: Israel gives up on peace with Sharon victory 07.02.2001: Comment: Israel's dark hour 07.02.2001: Despair as usual for Palestinians 07.02.2001: Sharon in his own words Read the full text of Sharon's victory speech Timeline Talk about it Talk to Guardian policy editor Jonathan Freedland, 3.30pm today Interactive guide An interactive history of Israel Video Ariel Sharon's victory speech, from the New York Times Audio Suzanne Goldenberg in Jerusalem: 'Barak promised peace and delivered an uprising' (2mins 53) Suzanne Goldenberg in Jerusalem: Israelis divided ahead of crucial election (2mins 35) Key players Ariel Sharon: from butcher to 'Lion' to Prime Minister of Israel Ehud Barak: the main loser Supreme test for 'Mr Palestine' From the Guardian archive 15.05.1948: Jewish state is born 19.11.1948, Arthur Koestler: Israel's the new generation Useful links Office of the Israeli Prime Minister Peace process: reference documents in full Israeli Knesset Email Barak, Sharon and Arafat Jerusalem Post Palestine Times",

      "bodyText": "Steel workers back strike Steelworkers have voted overwhelmingly to strike in protest at compulsory job losses, it was announced last night. Workers at the Scunthorpe plant in Lincolnshire voted by 60% in favour of strikes and 83% for industrial action short of a strike. The ballot was called by the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation in protest at job losses announced at the factory last year by steel group Corus. Since then the company has revealed plans to cut more than 6,000 jobs across the country, mainly in Wales and the north east of England. City Slicker settles Trinity Mirror has settled out of court with former City Slicker Anil Bhoyrul, sacked last year for his role in the Mirror newspaper's share tipping scandal. The company is understood to have agreed a payment of \u00a316,000 but no legal costs. Mr Bhoyrul was due to present a case for unfair dismissal next week. He and James Hipwell were fired for tipping firms whose shares they owned in their column. Mr Hipwell, who works for public relations agency Max Clifford, is considering his legal position in the light of the settlement. Doubt cast on Abbey name Abbey National could prove to be a \"brand too far\" for Lloyds TSB if its \u00a320bn bid is successful, according to market analysis by Datamonitor. It says Lloyds TSB would not be able to add Abbey to its name. Lloyds has insisted it will maintain the Abbey brand for two years. Abbey's board yesterday rejected the Lloyds TSB bid, describing it as a \"inadequate and subject to material uncertainities\", including whether the goverment will block the bid on competition grounds. Alli tunes in to digital radio Lord Waheed Alli, the television tycoon behind the C4 series the Big Breakfast, has become chairman of the Digital Radio Group, a consortium including Kelvin MacKenzie's Wireless Group, GWR, SMG and Charles Dunstone's Carphone Warehouse. The group is bidding for the final digital radio licence in London which will support eight stations. They will include a country music specialist Ritz 1035 and a station aimed at the gay community provided by Purple Radio. Lord Alli said the two previous London digital licences had provided existing mainstream analogue stations with a digital platform but had not substantially increased choice. Sema bid this week US oilfield services and electronics company Schlumberger will probably launch its bid for troubled Anglo-French information technology services firm Sema ahead of the weekend, banking sources said yesterday. They did not say if the bid was expected to be hostile or agreed by the Sema board, but said it planned to bid for Sema's entire share capital and that the offer was likely to be 70% cash with the remaining 30% in shares.",

Ever-expanding graphical sophistication and processing power has led to more realistic-looking games, which in turn has enabled designers to produce titles that involve more than sports, driving and shooting.

Robson thinks so. \"On the whole we are no longer purely portrayed as sex objects,\" she says. \"There are a lot of strong female characters in games that men like to look at, but women want to be like. The trend towards this type of character will grow as more women get into the industry.\"</p> <p> But Skinner sounds a note of caution: \"At a basic level, female production staff act as a reality check on blatantly offensive portrayals of women in games, but unfortunately power doesn't usually lie with the production staff.</p> <p> \"Until the industry and its investors feel a need to develop new genres and reach a broader market, there's still going to be pressure to cater primarily to the proven core of 15-30-year-old male gamers. \"And that means a pressure to continue with existing genres and their stereotypes, along with sexist marketing campaigns.\"</p> <p> Some in the industry are more cautious, however.

Mr Okawa said he would also donate bonds and shares in unlisted companies. A spokesman for Sega said the company had not decided how to use the gift but was in no rush to sell the stock. \"The shares we received are mostly those in our group firms which we hope to retain in the medium to longer term, assuming we win backing from creditor banks.\" Mr Okawa's move is rare - although during recent years several Japanese executives have taken responsibility for business failures by committing suicide. Investors have applauded the decision to abandon the 128-bit Dreamcast console as crucial for the profitability of a company that is facing a fourth successive year of losses. The move has caused Sega shares to rise by 7% so far this month - compared to a 3% fall in the benchmark Nikkei 225 average.",

      "bodyText": "Republicans made their first attempt of the new presidency yesterday to pass a law restricting abortion rights in the US. A bill introduced into both houses of Congress is intended to prevent some doctors prescribing the \"abortion pill\" mifepristone, otherwise known as RU-486, authorised for use in the last months of Bill Clinton's presidency. The pill, available in 13 other countries, including Britain, induces abortion during the first seven weeks of pregnancy without recourse to surgery. The licensing of the drug in the US in September 2000 by the food and drug administration has opened a new front in the long argument between supporters and opponents of birth control and abortion and has rapidly become the focus of the anti-abortion movement. The bill, sponsored by Senator Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas and Representative David Vitter of Louisiana, requires any doctor prescribing the pill to be qualified to handle complications from incomplete abortions and licensed to perform abortions. Its purpose is explicitly to restrict the prescription of RU-486, which is why the FDA rejected such conditions when the drug was approved last year. Mr Hutchinson said the only purpose of his bill was \"to ensure the health and safety of women who are prescribed RU-486\", but Gloria Feldt of the Planned Parenthood Federation accused the bill's backers of \"not liking science that contradicts their ideology\". The Hutchinson-Vitter bill will provide a crucial test of the willingness of the new Republican-controlled Congress to make abortion a central issue in the political situation created by the November 2000 election. While most Republicans are opposed to abortion rights, leaders of the party on both sides of the row recognise that the issue could polarise the electorate, not yet reconciled to Mr Bush's disputed election, and damage the party in the 2002 midterm elections. If the legislation is passed by Congress there is little doubt that Mr Bush will sign it. \"I think the FDA's decision to approve the abortion pill RU-486 is wrong,\" Mr Bush said last year. \"I fear that making this abortion pill widespread will make abortions more and more common, rather than more and more rare.\" He has since said that he does not have the power to overturn the approval of RU-486 on prescription, but that he would like to investigate whether the approval was conducted appropriately. The arrival of an avowedly \"pro-life\" president in the White House has re-energised anti-abortion conservatives. Although Mr Bush mostly kept quiet about the issue during the campaign, he has already delighted conservatives by reimposing a Reagan-era ban on US international support to organisations offering abortion advice or operations. At state level, the Republican party remains generally committed to tightening the law on abortion by any means possible. In Virginia this week, the legislature passed a law obliging doctors to offer detailed anti-abortion information, including pictures of foetuses, to women seeking terminations. Although conservative Republicans want Mr Bush to take the lead in a new campaign against the right to choose, he appears to be adopting a step-by-step approach. Last month, in a message to anti-abortion groups, he said: \"We share a great goal, to work towards a day when every child is welcomed in life and protected in law. \"We know this will not come easily or all at once.\"",

Conservative party officials have hailed the way immigration in earlier elections \"played well\" in the tabloids, and Labour leaks have shown Tony Blair worrying about the government looking soft. Even so, Jack Straw, who visits Stockholm today for talks with EU interior ministers, is right to be pushing two issues: speeding up the UK's current application process; and seeking a common European approach to asylum seekers.</p> <p>The need for a common European approach becomes ever more obvious as numbers grow. Equity demands that those arriving should be fairly distributed across the 15 member states. The UK is not taking a disproportionate share: although it accepts the second largest number, once that is related to population, Britain takes seventh place. The issue has been made more acute by a recent high court ruling barring asylum seekers being returned to France or Germany because of their stricter admission criteria. Both countries restrict admission to applicants facing persecution from governments, ignoring the threats which war lords or factions in civil wars can pose. This makes the UK more attractive to the organised gangs running illegal immigration rackets.</p> <p>A draft EU directive for harmonising approaches is already out for consultation. It will need to ensure a common approach on three crucial fronts - criteria, procedures, and protection. If it does not, \"asylum shopping\" will continue. The draft already has greater safeguards than the home secretary has proposed, but it will need to incorporate both the 1951 Geneva Convention and the even greater protection extended to asylum seekers by Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

      "bodyText": "The run up to an election is the worst possible time for reforming asylum procedures. Conservative party officials have hailed the way immigration in earlier elections \"played well\" in the tabloids, and Labour leaks have shown Tony Blair worrying about the government looking soft. Even so, Jack Straw, who visits Stockholm today for talks with EU interior ministers, is right to be pushing two issues: speeding up the UK's current application process; and seeking a common European approach to asylum seekers. The need for a common European approach becomes ever more obvious as numbers grow. Equity demands that those arriving should be fairly distributed across the 15 member states. The UK is not taking a disproportionate share: although it accepts the second largest number, once that is related to population, Britain takes seventh place. The issue has been made more acute by a recent high court ruling barring asylum seekers being returned to France or Germany because of their stricter admission criteria. Both countries restrict admission to applicants facing persecution from governments, ignoring the threats which war lords or factions in civil wars can pose. This makes the UK more attractive to the organised gangs running illegal immigration rackets. A draft EU directive for harmonising approaches is already out for consultation. It will need to ensure a common approach on three crucial fronts - criteria, procedures, and protection. If it does not, \"asylum shopping\" will continue. The draft already has greater safeguards than the home secretary has proposed, but it will need to incorporate both the 1951 Geneva Convention and the even greater protection extended to asylum seekers by Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. What must not happen is a levelling down to the lowest common denominator. Where Mr Straw is wrong is in seeking to rewrite the 1951 convention (with 137 signatories, that has little practical chance); in suggesting that countries from which refugees flee can be divided into three classes of risk: high, intermediate and safe (that is too crude); and in wishing to keep all refugees in camps close to the countries from which they come. All that needs further thought. But what matters most is that the meeting in Stockholm must not result in the withdrawal of the right to make an asylum claim in Europe.

George Bush, Vladimir Putin, and Jiang Zemin all attained equivalent positions by less convincingly legitimate means. All three have current responsibility for sustained, systematic human rights abuses, in Iraq, Chechnya and Tibet. Ethically speaking, should Britain thus cut ties with the US, Russia and China?

Those who believe in redemption, moral and otherwise, must surely give him the chance to prove it. But then, consider the political realities. Of 4.5m eligible Israeli voters, only 1.6m backed Mr Sharon. Should all Israelis be condemned by the minority's foolishness? Perhaps it should be recognised instead that Israel is a deeply divided society that yearns for peace yet is unable, through short- sightedness and fear, to make the necessary sacrifices. Israel has not turned its back on peace. But it has clearly, for now at least, lost confidence in the prospect.</p> <p>Those who would judge Mr Sharon must also judge themselves.

What has it to show now for over 300 intifada deaths and the destabilisation of Ehud Barak? At Taba, Yasser Arafat was closer to most of his goals than he is likely to be again, perhaps in his lifetime. All that is off the table now. Israel's Arab voters largely boycotted the poll. This was the icing on the Likud cake. As for the rejectionists of Damascus, Beirut and elsewhere, they publicly deplore Mr Sharon's arrival and privately celebrate it. He is not the only warmonger; and they have no moral superiority, no plan but pain. Like Mr Sharon, they prefer confrontation to compromise.

      "body": "<p>At the age of 31, Natalie Cole was about to die. Smoke poured in beneath the door of her room on the 15th floor of the Las Vegas Hilton. Seated next to her on the sofa, her bodyguard chose the moment to proclaim his secret passion, declaring: \"Natalie, we ought to make love here and now, because it's the last chance we're going to get.\" Natalie was unconcerned. She reached into her bag and started freebasing cocaine. </p> <p>\"Eight people died,\" she says now of the incident in 1981. She and Nate, her bodyguard, were rescued, but he never recovered from the effects of smoke inhalation. \"That was a real scary situation, but I didn't even have the sense to be afraid. I was more concerned that if I was gonna die, I was gonna die loaded to the gills. Thank God I had sent my baby son home, because I probably wouldn't have had the sense to care for him.\" </p> <p>That incident is just one of the startling revelations in Natalie Cole's autobiography, Angel on My Shoulder, which is generating tabloid headlines in America. Cole always seemed the girl who had everything. Daughter of Nat \"King\" Cole, she grew up in a family dubbed \"the black Kennedys\" to become one of the true divas of modern soul, the winner of eight Grammys. In the UK, she is best known for hits such as Miss You Like Crazy and Unforgettable, her 1991 album of her father's songs. But her book lifts the lid on a secret history of addiction and abuse. </p> <p>Cole details overdoses in tenement blocks, near-fatal car crashes, arrests, collapses, several tragic deaths and her sexual abuse at the hands of an unnamed family member. Her candour is doubly unexpected because the Natalie who emerges is not always very nice. </p> <p>\"Everyone's been surprised [by the candour]. I'm not a big reader of autobiographies, so I assumed that's what you did.\" She laughs. \"But at the same time, I can afford to be honest now and I hope it helps someone. </p> <p>\"I feel enough distance from the person I used to be. I'm not ashamed about my life any more because I've learnt from it.\" Cole's tale - delivered with disarming humour - is not just another drugs story, but one of the struggle for identity, of the consequences of grief and, most of all, of the pressures of following in the footsteps of one of the most famous black entertainers of the 20th century. </p> <p>Born on February 6 1950, Natalie Cole had an idyllic, if isolated, early life. Her father was one of the first black entertainers to secure a huge white audience, and the Coles were the first non-white family to live in the exclusive Hancock Park district of Los Angeles. Every three weeks Natalie was escorted to the black community on the other side of town to get her hair done. For years that was her only real taste of black culture. She was well into her teens before she realised that her family wasn't like anybody else's. King Cole had four children, but doted on Natalie. The velvet-voiced singer was convinced his daughter had inherited the \"gift\", and he introduced her to the world onstage. </p> <p>But everything changed with Nat's death from lung cancer in 1965. At 15, Natalie had to find a way to deal with a personal tragedy that was also a very public event. \"My mother worked hard to create this controlled exterior, which she continues to this day,\" she says. \"I don't think I ever really bawled or cried. That creates a pocket that you put all your stuff into, and it soon gets too heavy to carry.\" A week after the funeral, Natalie was in trouble for shoplifting. Her mother, appalled by the shame it brought on the family, sent her to a psychiatrist. The long, hard road had begun. </p> <p>As a child, Natalie was prone to allergies and became accustomed to what she calls \"a conga line of substances\" - a pill here, a quick jab there. In college she graduated to heroin and LSD. There Cole discovered the blackness that she felt had been denied her, at one point working with the Black Panthers. Her major driving forces were confusion over her identity, and rebellion against her father's name. \"I continually acted up to get attention,\" she says. \"My father gave me that, and once he left I felt that I didn't have any. </p> <p>\"I also felt resentful about having to live up to certain standards because I am 'the daughter of . . .'. I was saying, 'I am not perfect. Now let me show you how not perfect I am.' \" </p> <p>For most of the early 1970s, heroin blighted Cole's career in struggling soul bands such as Black Magic. She was insecure - shouted requests for her father's music were not welcomed - and terribly addicted. In one of \"many rock bottoms\", she worked as a \"prostitutes' lure\", walking the streets of Harlem to grab the attention of potential clients. </p> <p>Through \"immense self-will\" she kicked heroin in 1975 and a year later ended Aretha Franklin's nine-year run as the Grammys' best R&amp;B female vocalist.

      "bodyText": "At the age of 31, Natalie Cole was about to die. Smoke poured in beneath the door of her room on the 15th floor of the Las Vegas Hilton. Seated next to her on the sofa, her bodyguard chose the moment to proclaim his secret passion, declaring: \"Natalie, we ought to make love here and now, because it's the last chance we're going to get.\" Natalie was unconcerned. She reached into her bag and started freebasing cocaine. \"Eight people died,\" she says now of the incident in 1981. She and Nate, her bodyguard, were rescued, but he never recovered from the effects of smoke inhalation. \"That was a real scary situation, but I didn't even have the sense to be afraid. I was more concerned that if I was gonna die, I was gonna die loaded to the gills. Thank God I had sent my baby son home, because I probably wouldn't have had the sense to care for him.\" That incident is just one of the startling revelations in Natalie Cole's autobiography, Angel on My Shoulder, which is generating tabloid headlines in America. Cole always seemed the girl who had everything. Daughter of Nat \"King\" Cole, she grew up in a family dubbed \"the black Kennedys\" to become one of the true divas of modern soul, the winner of eight Grammys. In the UK, she is best known for hits such as Miss You Like Crazy and Unforgettable, her 1991 album of her father's songs. But her book lifts the lid on a secret history of addiction and abuse. Cole details overdoses in tenement blocks, near-fatal car crashes, arrests, collapses, several tragic deaths and her sexual abuse at the hands of an unnamed family member. Her candour is doubly unexpected because the Natalie who emerges is not always very nice. \"Everyone's been surprised [by the candour]. I'm not a big reader of autobiographies, so I assumed that's what you did.\" She laughs. \"But at the same time, I can afford to be honest now and I hope it helps someone. \"I feel enough distance from the person I used to be. I'm not ashamed about my life any more because I've learnt from it.\" Cole's tale - delivered with disarming humour - is not just another drugs story, but one of the struggle for identity, of the consequences of grief and, most of all, of the pressures of following in the footsteps of one of the most famous black entertainers of the 20th century. Born on February 6 1950, Natalie Cole had an idyllic, if isolated, early life. Her father was one of the first black entertainers to secure a huge white audience, and the Coles were the first non-white family to live in the exclusive Hancock Park district of Los Angeles. Every three weeks Natalie was escorted to the black community on the other side of town to get her hair done. For years that was her only real taste of black culture. She was well into her teens before she realised that her family wasn't like anybody else's. King Cole had four children, but doted on Natalie. The velvet-voiced singer was convinced his daughter had inherited the \"gift\", and he introduced her to the world onstage. But everything changed with Nat's death from lung cancer in 1965. At 15, Natalie had to find a way to deal with a personal tragedy that was also a very public event. \"My mother worked hard to create this controlled exterior, which she continues to this day,\" she says. \"I don't think I ever really bawled or cried. That creates a pocket that you put all your stuff into, and it soon gets too heavy to carry.\" A week after the funeral, Natalie was in trouble for shoplifting. Her mother, appalled by the shame it brought on the family, sent her to a psychiatrist. The long, hard road had begun. As a child, Natalie was prone to allergies and became accustomed to what she calls \"a conga line of substances\" - a pill here, a quick jab there. In college she graduated to heroin and LSD. There Cole discovered the blackness that she felt had been denied her, at one point working with the Black Panthers. Her major driving forces were confusion over her identity, and rebellion against her father's name. \"I continually acted up to get attention,\" she says. \"My father gave me that, and once he left I felt that I didn't have any. \"I also felt resentful about having to live up to certain standards because I am 'the daughter of . . .'. I was saying, 'I am not perfect. Now let me show you how not perfect I am.' \" For most of the early 1970s, heroin blighted Cole's career in struggling soul bands such as Black Magic. She was insecure - shouted requests for her father's music were not welcomed - and terribly addicted. In one of \"many rock bottoms\", she worked as a \"prostitutes' lure\", walking the streets of Harlem to grab the attention of potential clients. Through \"immense self-will\" she kicked heroin in 1975 and a year later ended Aretha Franklin's nine-year run as the Grammys' best R&amp;B female vocalist. Cole married Marvin Yancy, her songwriting partner and a Baptist preacher, and the couple had a son. Then, in her new role as queen of the disco era, she got hooked on cocaine. \"No one knew a lot about addiction in those days,\" she sighs. \"People would say, sometimes very angrily, 'Why can't you just stop? Don't you know who you are?' But the problems were still there within me. So yeah, I went back into it about a year after the birth of my son.\" Rather than help to cure her addiction, showbusiness nurtured it, but Cole does not want to pass the buck. \"I was young, very successful, and very stupid and naive. That's a deadly combination, whether it leads to drugs or out-of-control sex. I was so busy getting high I didn't have time for sex.\" Her health began to suffer, and one day her son rode his tricycle into a swimming pool while she was smoking crack. Then, in 1983, Cole successfully went through a rehab programme. The walls that had been built up through years of abuse gradually tumbled down, not least when one of her drug counsellors told her she was still grieving for her father. \"I said, 'What? No way! I'm over that!' Which couldn't have been further from the truth.\" Cole's complex relationship with her mother is equally important. Now 78, Maria Cole sued the four children in 1998 over the contents of their father's will. Despite Natalie's efforts, the pair don't speak and Maria reacted \"negatively\" when Natalie sent her a copy of her autobiography. Indeed, Cole's story has no Hollywood-style happy ending, and several issues remain unresolved. Although she finally embraced her father's music with the worldwide hit Unforgettable, her career goes up and down. She bears a terrible guilt over her first husband Yancy's death in 1985, seven years after she introduced him to cocaine, not knowing he had a heart condition. \"That will stay with me for ever,\" she says. \"We were actually talking about getting back together.

      "body": "<p>We make love and, if we're lucky, die in bed. We sleep and dream there. Yet relatively few plays take place exclusively in bed. In the bad old days of censorship, it was largely a matter of decorum - to the Lord Chamberlain, bed implied hanky-panky. Now it is more a practical question: if drama is about taking characters on a journey, what can happen to them if they spend much of their time horizontal? </p> <p>Dramatists, however, are an ingenious lot; in recent years several have given new meaning to the phrase \"confined to bed\" by turning a physical restriction into an opportunity. Jim Cartwright's play Bed showed seven old people lying side by side in a vast vertical bed and drifting through their dream-driven memories. At one point an elderly pair even descended through a hole in the bed, like Jack and Jill in reverse, to fetch a glass of water. </p> <p>But other writers have shown that the bed can be used as a source of debate and dreams. In Brian Clark's Whose Life Is it Anyway? the hero, paralysed from the neck down, claimed the right to die by being taken off his life-support machine; the arguments were so interesting you forgot about the play's lack of physical dynamic. Pinter, in his Oliver Sacks-inspired A Kind of Alaska, shows his heroine awakening at the age of 45 after a 29-year \"sleep\", to be confronted by a changed world; but what one remembers, in performance, is Judi Dench's fierce sense of recollected gaiety as the resurrected Deborah. </p> <p>If any dramatist can be guaranteed to turn an apparent limitation into a major asset, it is Alan Ayckbourn, and in Bedroom Farce he had the brilliant idea of putting three bedrooms and four couples on stage, with an itinerant pair of jokers, Trevor and Susannah, hawking their neuroses around like door-to-door salesmen. The title played on our traditional expectations of illicit sex. But Ayckbourn's breakthrough was to show that the bedroom is also a place of terrifying self-revelation. </p> <p>Much the funniest scene took place in the bedroom of Trevor's parents, Ernest and Delia. They come back from an awful dinner at a swanky restaurant and sit up in bed eating pilchards on toast, while Ernest reads aloud from Tom Brown's Schooldays. The semi-detachment of the long-married was highlighted when a demented Susannah burst in. \"Do you know what it's like to be ignored?\" she passionately enquired. \"Well yes, as a matter of fact I do,\" replied Joan Hickson, evoking a lifetime of emotional solitude. Few dramatists know more about what happens in bed - or doesn't - than Alan Ayckbourn. </p> <p>If the bedroom has only recently become the exclusive setting for a play, beds have long featured in drama. Bed and Bard could be the subject of a thesis. Instantly one thinks of the closet scene in Hamlet, Iachimo stealing out of a trunk to peer at the sleeping Imogen in Cymbeline and the seeming-dead Henry IV unwarily leaving his crown on his pillow. Shakespeare could not show us explicit sexual love but it's amazing how much you can deduce from his plays about his characters' off-stage behaviour. I reckon the Macbeths, nocturnal wandering aside, would have been pretty good together in bed whereas Portia is likely to find Bassanio's eyes, after marriage, wandering towards the boys in Belmont. </p> <p>But this is a key point about the bed in drama: even when it is not present, it looms large. No dramatist was more physically circumspect than Ibsen and yet his plays, to use a John Osborne simile, are as sexually obsessed as a medieval monastery. There's a great moment in A Doll's House, after Nora has danced her frantic party-piece tarantella, when Torvald can hardly wait to get her into bed; with typically mordant irony, Ibsen then has Dr Rank pay a late-night call to announce his impending death. And it's astonishing how riddled with sexual references Hedda Gabler is. We can easily imagine the horrors of Hedda's honeymoon with Tesman. And you don't need to be a Freudian to see the significance of Judge Brack's preference for taking \"the back way\". </p> <p>Physical inhibitions, in short, have their own power - you don't always need to see a bed to imagine it. I can recall at least two productions of Congreve's The Way of the World, for instance, where a bed has been prominently and gratuitously deployed in case we missed the raunchiness under the raillery. Even Coward knew how to fill his plays with the heady aroma of sex without getting his characters into bed: the middle act of Private Lives, for instance, is an extended piece of love-play in which Elyot and Amanda romp fastidiously around a sofa. </p> <p>Only in farce does the bed become indispensable . Even here the promise is greater than the reality, for the bed is more often a source of pain than of pleasure. Feydeau was the great master of the bed as potential minefield. In one of his plays a bed swings embarrassingly into view at the inadvertent press of a button, and in Le Dindon a deaf elderly couple remain oblivious to an alarm that rings like a tocsin under their mattress. </p> <p>Sex and death: these are the eternal themes of drama and as long as they remain so the bed will be a necessary piece of theatrical equipment. But the bed also fulfils myriad other functions in drama. It can be a focus for trickery and deceit - think of Jonson's Volpone conning his eager supplicants in his Venetian king-size. It can also be a source of revelation. The pivotal scene in Pinter's Betrayal, also set in Venice, shows Robert coolly appraising Emma of his discovery of her affair. </p> <p>Beds and drama go together like a horse and carriage. Even when convention kept beds unseen they still dominated the action. Now the bed has been put centre-stage. It can be used for disclosure and concealment, lies and truth, birth and death, moral enquiry and mundane bed-and-butter issues. The story of 20th-century drama is of an abandonment of the drawing-room to explore the rest of the house. As a result, the bed has become king. And, though it presents dramatists and designers with the task of how to give physical expression to a horizontal inclination, you can be sure of one thing: it's a challenge they won't take lying down.</p>",

      "body": "<p>As comparisons go, it is a delicious one. Four close chums, all with a touch of the jolly hockey sticks about them, strong women each. And all with the same name. It is almost as if the Four Marys, a comic strip mainstay of the girls' magazine Bunty for the past 40 years, has become flesh.</p> <p>Maggie Jones, Margaret Prosser, Margaret Wall and Margaret McDonagh are close friends. They go shopping together and spend weekends away as a foursome. Earlier this week, they met for dinner (at a suitably cool central London restaurant), something they do as often as they can spare the time. But it is unlikely they spent the evening discussing gymslips and gymkhanas as the Four Marys do. These women have captured the commanding heights of the most powerful machine in British politics - the Labour party. Four years after Blair's Babes were first feted (and later scorned) by the British press, the new Labour leadership say they are proving that it is possible to feminise even the most aggressively male of institutions.</p> <p>Labour's national executive committee or NEC, the keeper of the party conscience, is now controlled by women. Jones, 45, public policy director of the public sector workers' union Unison, became chairwoman of the Labour party in October. Wall, who is in her 50s and national secretary of the MSF union, is her deputy. Prosser, 63, who made her name as women's officer in the hostile environment of the Transport and General Workers Union in the 80s, has been the party's treasurer for the past five years. And McDonagh, 39, is the most powerful of them all. She climbed through the ranks of London Labour party to become the national party's first woman general secretary in 1998.</p> <p>But despite being the first party to have a meaningful female presence in its positions of influence, Labour has not succeeded in appealing to women voters. The influential Fawcett Society published a study earlier this week showing that women's disillusionment with Labour has risen sharply in the past year. Tony Blair's personal \"satisfaction rating\" among women fell from 50% in January 2000 to 38% in November, and women voters are markedly more unhappy with the government than their male counterparts. The Four Margarets, it seems, have a bit more work to do in the run up to the election.</p> <p>Maggie Jones is adamant that the Labour party's modus operandi is changing. \"It's warmer, it's more open and it's more consensual,\" she claims. Wall agrees: \"Everyone, especially women, feels they can contribute. It is more inclusive.\"</p> <p>If true, this is a sea change. To anyone with a memory longer than 1997, the idea of the NEC, the once semi-public arena for all Labour's internal conflict, as a warm and friendly body run by women is a revolutionary one. In the old days, participants in what was then the monthly meeting of the NEC would emerge spitting bloodied teeth live into the lunchtime television news to declare another victory (both sides always said they had won). It was a shell-pocked no-man's land, fought over inch by inch by the tribes that struggled for control of Labour. Usually it was left versus right, sometimes it was party versus government, but always it was conflict.</p> <p>And now? It's hard to find anyone who doesn't think the NEC's bi-monthly meetings a kinder, gentler place. \"It's definitely having an effect,\" says Helen Jackson, a tough and experienced MP, parliamentary aide to successive Northern Ireland ministers, and member of the NEC for two years.</p> <p>For example, we've moved right away from silly votes. In the old days, people would put in a resolution, and there would be a vote, and they would lose. But the vote would be recorded, so they would feel they had done their bit on, say, raising the minimum wage to \u00a35 an hour. But they hadn't changed anything.\"</p> <p>The four Margarets' favourite word is \"outcome\". Look how little confrontation achieves, they say, and how much damage it can do. They insist that it is possible to make a difference without having a chest-thumping row first. Prosser is convinced that confrontation doesn't pay. \"Look at human relations. You have to persuade people that they want to do what you want them to do.\"</p> <p>\"We got going in about 1995,\" says Maggie Jones who, with Wall, is largely responsible for the system of linking party, trade unions and leadership called Partnership in Power. \"The whole ethos was about non-confrontational policy-making. It was revolutionary. We thought we would never get [the party] conference to accept it. But they did.\"</p> <p>There are some unexpected converts to this supposedly feminised approach. For example, Dennis Skinner, the former miner and veteran of 30 years of uncompromising left-wing politics, is one. \"In the past 18 months there has been a growing feeling, from unexpected areas, that it's OK to say your party piece [at the NEC]. And I am beginning to look at things in a different way. I'm not so sure now, looking back on the nights when we sent out for fish and chips to keep us going until midnight, that these were actually the highlight of my life.\"</p> <p>But what have the four women changed? Critics charge - and even supporters fear - that Labour's powerful women, in their quest for new ways of doing things, risk being identified with all the most mistrusted aspects of new Labour. They are in danger, they say, of being portrayed as the puppets of a centralised, authoritarian administration, fig leaves for democracy.</p> <p>And where once each meeting of the NEC was attended by a dozen television crews and closely monitored, not only by fans of the big fight but by everyone who cared where the Labour party or government was heading, it is now cursed with anonymity. The executive meets less often, its activities are largely governed by the agenda of the party's Millbank headquarters (none of the ordinary members on the NEC had even heard of the much-criticised new logo) and the way its members are elected is designed as far as possible to exclude the awkward squad. But the real test is approaching. Over the next few weeks, the election manifesto will be finalised. The four Margarets are at the heart of the debate. In the minefield of possibilities and promises, on the future of the railways, on crime and punishment and public investment and pensions, lies a fragmentary vision of the future. There will probably be fewer women MPs in the next parliament than in this one. Far from reaching critical mass in 1997, the local parties which select candidates have slipped back into the old ways of choosing the first man to hand. So can these women use their power to squeeze into Labour's top priorities a commitment to change the law so that it is once again possible to have all-women shortlists?</p> <p>All four women are committed to them. Two - Wall and Jones - run the selection panel which over the next few weeks will slot candidates in to the seats where vacancies exist. But such a commitment would not be universally popular. Once more the unfair and unflattering eye of the tabloid press would linger over the women in the class of 97. It is the first big test of consensus, of whether it can bring results - or whether, in the end, politics always comes down to power and the determination to use it.</p>",

      "bodyText": "As comparisons go, it is a delicious one. Four close chums, all with a touch of the jolly hockey sticks about them, strong women each. And all with the same name. It is almost as if the Four Marys, a comic strip mainstay of the girls' magazine Bunty for the past 40 years, has become flesh. Maggie Jones, Margaret Prosser, Margaret Wall and Margaret McDonagh are close friends. They go shopping together and spend weekends away as a foursome. Earlier this week, they met for dinner (at a suitably cool central London restaurant), something they do as often as they can spare the time. But it is unlikely they spent the evening discussing gymslips and gymkhanas as the Four Marys do. These women have captured the commanding heights of the most powerful machine in British politics - the Labour party. Four years after Blair's Babes were first feted (and later scorned) by the British press, the new Labour leadership say they are proving that it is possible to feminise even the most aggressively male of institutions. Labour's national executive committee or NEC, the keeper of the party conscience, is now controlled by women. Jones, 45, public policy director of the public sector workers' union Unison, became chairwoman of the Labour party in October. Wall, who is in her 50s and national secretary of the MSF union, is her deputy. Prosser, 63, who made her name as women's officer in the hostile environment of the Transport and General Workers Union in the 80s, has been the party's treasurer for the past five years. And McDonagh, 39, is the most powerful of them all. She climbed through the ranks of London Labour party to become the national party's first woman general secretary in 1998. But despite being the first party to have a meaningful female presence in its positions of influence, Labour has not succeeded in appealing to women voters. The influential Fawcett Society published a study earlier this week showing that women's disillusionment with Labour has risen sharply in the past year. Tony Blair's personal \"satisfaction rating\" among women fell from 50% in January 2000 to 38% in November, and women voters are markedly more unhappy with the government than their male counterparts. The Four Margarets, it seems, have a bit more work to do in the run up to the election. Maggie Jones is adamant that the Labour party's modus operandi is changing. \"It's warmer, it's more open and it's more consensual,\" she claims. Wall agrees: \"Everyone, especially women, feels they can contribute. It is more inclusive.\" If true, this is a sea change. To anyone with a memory longer than 1997, the idea of the NEC, the once semi-public arena for all Labour's internal conflict, as a warm and friendly body run by women is a revolutionary one. In the old days, participants in what was then the monthly meeting of the NEC would emerge spitting bloodied teeth live into the lunchtime television news to declare another victory (both sides always said they had won). It was a shell-pocked no-man's land, fought over inch by inch by the tribes that struggled for control of Labour. Usually it was left versus right, sometimes it was party versus government, but always it was conflict. And now? It's hard to find anyone who doesn't think the NEC's bi-monthly meetings a kinder, gentler place. \"It's definitely having an effect,\" says Helen Jackson, a tough and experienced MP, parliamentary aide to successive Northern Ireland ministers, and member of the NEC for two years. For example, we've moved right away from silly votes. In the old days, people would put in a resolution, and there would be a vote, and they would lose. But the vote would be recorded, so they would feel they had done their bit on, say, raising the minimum wage to \u00a35 an hour. But they hadn't changed anything.\" The four Margarets' favourite word is \"outcome\". Look how little confrontation achieves, they say, and how much damage it can do. They insist that it is possible to make a difference without having a chest-thumping row first. Prosser is convinced that confrontation doesn't pay. \"Look at human relations. You have to persuade people that they want to do what you want them to do.\" \"We got going in about 1995,\" says Maggie Jones who, with Wall, is largely responsible for the system of linking party, trade unions and leadership called Partnership in Power. \"The whole ethos was about non-confrontational policy-making. It was revolutionary. We thought we would never get [the party] conference to accept it. But they did.\" There are some unexpected converts to this supposedly feminised approach. For example, Dennis Skinner, the former miner and veteran of 30 years of uncompromising left-wing politics, is one. \"In the past 18 months there has been a growing feeling, from unexpected areas, that it's OK to say your party piece [at the NEC]. And I am beginning to look at things in a different way. I'm not so sure now, looking back on the nights when we sent out for fish and chips to keep us going until midnight, that these were actually the highlight of my life.\" But what have the four women changed? Critics charge - and even supporters fear - that Labour's powerful women, in their quest for new ways of doing things, risk being identified with all the most mistrusted aspects of new Labour. They are in danger, they say, of being portrayed as the puppets of a centralised, authoritarian administration, fig leaves for democracy. And where once each meeting of the NEC was attended by a dozen television crews and closely monitored, not only by fans of the big fight but by everyone who cared where the Labour party or government was heading, it is now cursed with anonymity. The executive meets less often, its activities are largely governed by the agenda of the party's Millbank headquarters (none of the ordinary members on the NEC had even heard of the much-criticised new logo) and the way its members are elected is designed as far as possible to exclude the awkward squad. But the real test is approaching. Over the next few weeks, the election manifesto will be finalised. The four Margarets are at the heart of the debate. In the minefield of possibilities and promises, on the future of the railways, on crime and punishment and public investment and pensions, lies a fragmentary vision of the future. There will probably be fewer women MPs in the next parliament than in this one. Far from reaching critical mass in 1997, the local parties which select candidates have slipped back into the old ways of choosing the first man to hand. So can these women use their power to squeeze into Labour's top priorities a commitment to change the law so that it is once again possible to have all-women shortlists? All four women are committed to them. Two - Wall and Jones - run the selection panel which over the next few weeks will slot candidates in to the seats where vacancies exist. But such a commitment would not be universally popular. Once more the unfair and unflattering eye of the tabloid press would linger over the women in the class of 97. It is the first big test of consensus, of whether it can bring results - or whether, in the end, politics always comes down to power and the determination to use it.",

      "body": "<p>Putting pictures on the web is the quickest and easiest way to share them. You don't even need a computer to do it. And although you may never have thought about starting an online photo album, there is a very good chance you already have one. </p> <p>The simplest and cheapest way to get your pictures online is to have it done as part of the D&amp;P (developing and printing) process. Such services have become common in the US over the past couple of years, and Fotango, a start-up based in London, now offers one in Europe. </p> <p>Post a 35mm or APS film to Fotango and it will put your pictures online free. You can also order a set of prints or a Photo CD when you send off the film: see <a href=\"http://www.fotango.com\">www.fotango.com</a> for prices. The service is also available via <a href=\"http://whsmith.fotango.com\" target=\"_new\">WH Smith</a>, which means you can take your film into any branch for processing, and have the pictures put online for an extra 99p. </p> <p>D&amp;P services usually produce good results because they scan the original nega tives, not machine-made prints that may be of variable quality. And since manual scanning is hard work, they save a lot of effort. </p> <p>Of course, it is not happy snappers who are driving the online album market. It is, rather, the growing number of people who are buying digital cameras, as the image quality goes up and prices come down. </p> <p>Digital camera owners tend not to say: \"I'll stick a print in the post\". They probably don't have any prints. They can and do offer to send pictures by email, but this can create problems. </p> <p>Image files can be large, and take time to upload and download. Recipients often do not like receiving large attachments by email, and may have problems decoding them. Worse, a handful of images can fill up a mailbox, which may mean more important mail is \"bounced\" (rejected). </p> <p>The obvious solution is to put the pictures on a web page, so people can look at them when they like. And when the first free web space became available on GeoCities and similar \"homesteading\" sites, that is what many keen photographers did. However, this still required too much time and effort for people who just wanted to put a couple of snaps online - especially if they were just snaps of things they were auctioning on eBay. </p> <p>About three years ago, PhotoPoint came up with the solution. PhotoPoint lets you put pictures on the web by emailing them to <a href=\"mailto:photos@photopoint.com\">photos@photopoint.com</a>. You then log on to the service using your email address, and search for other people's pictures by using their email addresses. </p> <p>Also, once you have put a picture in a PhotoPoint album, it has a unique address. This means you can email a friend a link to a picture and they can go straight to it. For example, my photo of New York, a theme hotel in Las Vegas, is <a href=\"http://albums.photopoint.com/j/View?u=1506916&amp;a=11378150&amp;p=\" 40014265\" \"target=\"_new\">here</a>. </p> <p> What could be easier - if you just have just have to click on a web link? PhotoPoint now offers other ways to upload photos. You can upload up to 10 images at once, by browsing for each one on your hard drive and selecting it in a search box. It works exactly like adding an attachment to an email message in Hotmail or Yahoo. Almost every online album site has the same facility. </p> <p>PhotoPoint has also introduced Image Express software for Microsoft Windows. Download this helper application and you can upload up to 100 pictures at a time. Finally, the site has a tie in with Kodak's PhotoNet Online service in the US, so users can have films processed and then transfer the image files to PhotoPoint. </p> <p>If you only want to upload one or two dozen pictures, you should have no problems with a service that lets you upload six to 10 at a time. But if you want to upload a couple of hundred, or a couple of thousand, then make sure you choose a service with bulk upload software such as Image Express. </p> <p>Another useful PhotoPoint feature, not found on all services, is the ability to rotate an image. This solves one common problem, which is accidentally uploading pictures as horizontals when they should be vertical. PhotoPoint also allows simple cropping, while other sites offer \"image enhancement\" software. </p> <p>Dozens of rivals have entered the online album business over the past couple of years. It has attracted some big players including <a href=\"http://kodak.photonet.com/\" target=\"_new\">Kodak</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cartogra.com\" target=\"_new\">Hewlett-Packard</a>, <a href=\"http://www.GatherRound.com\" target=\"_new\">Intel</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ImageStation.com\" target=\"_new\">Sony</a>, as well as start-ups such as <a href=\"http://www.Ophoto.com\" target=\"_new\">Ophoto</a>, <a href=\"http://www.Shutterfly.com\" target=\"_new\">Shutterfly</a> and - in the UK - <a href=\"http://www.photobox.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">PhotoBox</a>. </p> <p>Most are free, but derive some income from making prints. This includes printing images on mugs, plates, T-shirts, mousemats and other memorabilia. If you allow it, they are also happy to make prints for your friends, or even for people you don't know who just like the picture. </p> <p>Many other web sites have also added photo album facilities, including the leading portals: Yahoo, AOL and the Microsoft network, MSN. If you already have a Yahoo or Hotmail address, then you already have an online photo album. Visto includes one too. </p> <p>The idea of making prints raises one of the problems that is usually hidden by photo album services: image size. If you use a digital camera, selecting the best possible image quality will result in a multi-megabyte file. Even compressed JPEG (.jpg) images will often range from 200K to 900K. If you just want to share a snapshot, this is far too large: about 35-135K would download quicker. However, if an image is going to be used for printing, you want the best resolution you can get. </p> <p> Typically online albums will let you upload any image you like, but will only display a reduced version. For example, my New York picture was uploaded as a 182K image with a resolution of 1280 by 960 pixels, and on <a href=\"http://i18.yimg.com/18/bfd77d97/h/cf42b249/al-NY-LV.JPG\" target=\"_new\">Yahoo</a>, that is what you get. </p> <p>However, the one you can see on PhotoPoint has been reduced to a 43K JPEG with VGA resolution (640 by 480 pixels), while the one on <a href=\"http://www.fotango.com/p/eba00059257f00000002.jpg\">Fotango</a> has become ludicrously small. </p> <p>Another problem I had with Fontango was that I could not see how to link to a whole album. This is easy with <a href=\"http://albums.photopoint.com/j/AlbumIndex?u=1506916&amp;a=11378150\" target=\"_new\">PhotoPoint</a>, and <a href=\"http://photos.yahoo.com/scholia\" target=\"_new\">Yahoo</a>. For comparison purposes, all contain the same four photos. </p> <p>Another point to consider is the total amount of space allowed. For example, my four Las Vegas photos already take up a megabyte, so Yahoo's generous 25 megabytes of free space may only hold 100 pictures. </p> <p>Some sites allow an infinite amount of storage - dangerous, if there is no limit on uploading multimedia files and movies! - while others are more circumspect. </p> <p>The obvious way around such limits is to open multiple accounts. You could give them different names (scholialasvegas, scholia friends, scholiapets etc) or simply numbers (scholia001, scholia002 and so on). There are already people with more than 200 Yahoo accounts. </p> <p>All the online photo albums let you keep your pictures private. However, you can \"publish\" them to the global populace, if you like, and list them in Yahoo-style category guides. Many albums also have \"guest books\" where visitors can leave comments. </p> <p>But if you really want to be the next <a href=\"http://www.haskins.com\">Sam Haskins</a> or <a href=\"http://www.anseladams.com\">Ansel Adams</a>, do the job properly and design a website to suit your pictures. </p> <p>Online albums are just a simple way to share snaps with friends.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Putting pictures on the web is the quickest and easiest way to share them. You don't even need a computer to do it. And although you may never have thought about starting an online photo album, there is a very good chance you already have one. The simplest and cheapest way to get your pictures online is to have it done as part of the D&amp;P (developing and printing) process. Such services have become common in the US over the past couple of years, and Fotango, a start-up based in London, now offers one in Europe. Post a 35mm or APS film to Fotango and it will put your pictures online free. You can also order a set of prints or a Photo CD when you send off the film: see www.fotango.com for prices. The service is also available via WH Smith, which means you can take your film into any branch for processing, and have the pictures put online for an extra 99p. D&amp;P services usually produce good results because they scan the original nega tives, not machine-made prints that may be of variable quality. And since manual scanning is hard work, they save a lot of effort. Of course, it is not happy snappers who are driving the online album market. It is, rather, the growing number of people who are buying digital cameras, as the image quality goes up and prices come down. Digital camera owners tend not to say: \"I'll stick a print in the post\". They probably don't have any prints. They can and do offer to send pictures by email, but this can create problems. Image files can be large, and take time to upload and download. Recipients often do not like receiving large attachments by email, and may have problems decoding them. Worse, a handful of images can fill up a mailbox, which may mean more important mail is \"bounced\" (rejected). The obvious solution is to put the pictures on a web page, so people can look at them when they like. And when the first free web space became available on GeoCities and similar \"homesteading\" sites, that is what many keen photographers did. However, this still required too much time and effort for people who just wanted to put a couple of snaps online - especially if they were just snaps of things they were auctioning on eBay. About three years ago, PhotoPoint came up with the solution. PhotoPoint lets you put pictures on the web by emailing them to photos@photopoint.com. You then log on to the service using your email address, and search for other people's pictures by using their email addresses. Also, once you have put a picture in a PhotoPoint album, it has a unique address. This means you can email a friend a link to a picture and they can go straight to it. For example, my photo of New York, a theme hotel in Las Vegas, is here. What could be easier - if you just have just have to click on a web link? PhotoPoint now offers other ways to upload photos. You can upload up to 10 images at once, by browsing for each one on your hard drive and selecting it in a search box. It works exactly like adding an attachment to an email message in Hotmail or Yahoo. Almost every online album site has the same facility. PhotoPoint has also introduced Image Express software for Microsoft Windows. Download this helper application and you can upload up to 100 pictures at a time. Finally, the site has a tie in with Kodak's PhotoNet Online service in the US, so users can have films processed and then transfer the image files to PhotoPoint. If you only want to upload one or two dozen pictures, you should have no problems with a service that lets you upload six to 10 at a time. But if you want to upload a couple of hundred, or a couple of thousand, then make sure you choose a service with bulk upload software such as Image Express. Another useful PhotoPoint feature, not found on all services, is the ability to rotate an image. This solves one common problem, which is accidentally uploading pictures as horizontals when they should be vertical. PhotoPoint also allows simple cropping, while other sites offer \"image enhancement\" software. Dozens of rivals have entered the online album business over the past couple of years. It has attracted some big players including Kodak, Hewlett-Packard, Intel and Sony, as well as start-ups such as Ophoto, Shutterfly and - in the UK - PhotoBox. Most are free, but derive some income from making prints. This includes printing images on mugs, plates, T-shirts, mousemats and other memorabilia. If you allow it, they are also happy to make prints for your friends, or even for people you don't know who just like the picture. Many other web sites have also added photo album facilities, including the leading portals: Yahoo, AOL and the Microsoft network, MSN. If you already have a Yahoo or Hotmail address, then you already have an online photo album. Visto includes one too. The idea of making prints raises one of the problems that is usually hidden by photo album services: image size. If you use a digital camera, selecting the best possible image quality will result in a multi-megabyte file. Even compressed JPEG (.jpg) images will often range from 200K to 900K. If you just want to share a snapshot, this is far too large: about 35-135K would download quicker. However, if an image is going to be used for printing, you want the best resolution you can get. Typically online albums will let you upload any image you like, but will only display a reduced version. For example, my New York picture was uploaded as a 182K image with a resolution of 1280 by 960 pixels, and on Yahoo, that is what you get. However, the one you can see on PhotoPoint has been reduced to a 43K JPEG with VGA resolution (640 by 480 pixels), while the one on Fotango has become ludicrously small. Another problem I had with Fontango was that I could not see how to link to a whole album. This is easy with PhotoPoint, and Yahoo. For comparison purposes, all contain the same four photos. Another point to consider is the total amount of space allowed. For example, my four Las Vegas photos already take up a megabyte, so Yahoo's generous 25 megabytes of free space may only hold 100 pictures. Some sites allow an infinite amount of storage - dangerous, if there is no limit on uploading multimedia files and movies! - while others are more circumspect. The obvious way around such limits is to open multiple accounts. You could give them different names (scholialasvegas, scholia friends, scholiapets etc) or simply numbers (scholia001, scholia002 and so on). There are already people with more than 200 Yahoo accounts. All the online photo albums let you keep your pictures private. However, you can \"publish\" them to the global populace, if you like, and list them in Yahoo-style category guides. Many albums also have \"guest books\" where visitors can leave comments. But if you really want to be the next Sam Haskins or Ansel Adams, do the job properly and design a website to suit your pictures. Online albums are just a simple way to share snaps with friends.",

Each drawer in the broom-cupboard sized fridge is bulging with plastic sachets. </p> <p>Mr Coleman pulls one out and brushes off the ice. It contains a sliver of red material, a few centimetres long. The label reads \"liver\". </p> <p>Pharmagene has more than 250,000 bits of human body in its compact laboratory, which would test the stomach of even the most devoted fan of horror films. The company provides a unique service - it tests drugs on human tissue, reducing the need to use animals. </p> <p>\"Our whole business relies on altruism,\" says chief executive Alistair Riddell. \"The goodwill that makes people give blood, or donate their organs.\" </p> <p>Pharmagene floated last July with a market value of \u00a3142m, raising nearly \u00a340m on hopes that it could persuade drugs companies to use its tests on human body samples as a partial alternative to tests on animals by controversial firms such as Huntingdon Life Sciences. Pfizer, Glaxo SmithKline, Novartis and AstraZeneca are all clients, to a greater or lesser degree. </p> <p>Over the past month, the firm has been thrust into the public gaze. It unwittingly found itself as a darling of animal rights supporters, as violent activists came close to shutting down Huntingdon. Then its supply of donated tissue was briefly halted last week as the nation wrung its hands about the Alder Hey scandal, in which surgeons removed organs during autopsies without permission. </p> <p>Understandably, Pharmagene is at pains to point out that it accepts human tissue from patients only following stringent consent procedures. \"From the start, this company has been absolutely meticulous about adhering to all sorts of procedures,\" says Mr Coleman. \"We've turned away samples in the past when some level of consent has been lacking.\" </p> <p>During the Alder Hey controversy, nurses at some of the 16 hospitals which provide tissue to Pharmagene were reluctant to approach to explain consent forms to patients, effectively cutting off the supply. The problem was short-lived, but it was worrying - Dr Riddell says that securing a plentiful supply of fresh body parts is the company's biggest challenge. </p> <p>About 70% of Pharmagene's samples are removed from living patients, during routine operations. For example, surgeons remove a few centimetres of healthy colon at each end of any diseased section when operating on sufferers of bowel cancer. If the patient is agreeable, this may find its way to Pharmagene to help test how effectively new medicines are absorbed in the intestine. </p> <p>The other 30% of tissue samples are removed after death, from patients who have pledged their bodies for scientific research. These samples are often more valuable, and need to be acted upon urgently. Pharmagene has a sophisticated network of links with medical centres, allowing it to receive donations within a few hours of a patient's death. </p> <p>\"We get a phone call and we immediately arrange a courier to go and collect the material,\" says Mr Coleman. \"We have to be ready when the tissue is ready.\" </p> <p>Peterborough Hospital keeps a national register of people who have pledged their bodies for research. Mr Coleman and Dr Riddell are on the list, as is much of Pharmagene's workforce. </p> <p>So can Pharmagene's research replace the drugs tests on rats, mice and dogs which so many people find objectionable? Since the Thalidomide tragedy, government regulations require new medicines to be tested on animals, so at present Pharmagene's work is an additional, rather than alternative, stage. Mr Coleman says: \"Despite the similarities we have with animals, there are a huge number of differences. That's the reason so many drugs fail in clinical trials.\" </p> <p>He believes human tissue research should take place before animal testing, though the latter cannot be stopped completely: \"There is a continuing need for some animal testing but the challenge is to limit it to the minimum necessary.\" </p> <p>Perhaps Pharmagene's more immediately promising sideline is in testing where genes are expressed in the body, using the same tissue samples. The human genome project has thrown up thousands of different \"target\" genes, involved in disease mechanisms. Pharmagene can help drugs firms produce accurate drugs by pinpointing where these targets are active. </p> <p>More than 3,700 people have donated tissue to Pharmagene since the company was founded five years ago. Can the firm rely on a steady supply if, as expected, its business expands? Dr Riddell says: \"The only reason there could be a negative impact on us from Alder Hey is through guilt by association - because we are, in some sense, in the same sector.\" </p> <p>He is hopeful that the scandal will not affect long-term donations for research: \"I think not - there seems to be an undercurrent of enthusiasm for donating. But how do we really know what goes through the collective brain?\" </p> <p><strong>Making the break</strong></p> <p>Pharmagene was founded in 1995 by Gordon Smith Baxter, a former SmithKline Beecham executive, and Robert Coleman, a pharmacologist from Glaxo Wellcome. </p> <p>Frustrated at working in big organisations, they wanted to try their idea of \"facilitating the experimental use of human tissue\" in a start-up company. </p> <p>Revenues have risen from \u00a3430,000 in 1997 to \u00a31.26m last year, although the company warned at the end of last year that mergers such as that between Glaxo and SmithKline had caused some customers to defer payments. </p> <p>Pharmagene lost \u00a34.21m last year but, after raising \u00a340m in a flotation, has plenty of cash to absorb its spending of \u00a3350,000 a month. </p> <p>In addition to testing drugs for clients, the firm develops its own products.</p>",

Pharmagene has a sophisticated network of links with medical centres, allowing it to receive donations within a few hours of a patient's death. \"We get a phone call and we immediately arrange a courier to go and collect the material,\" says Mr Coleman. \"We have to be ready when the tissue is ready.\" Peterborough Hospital keeps a national register of people who have pledged their bodies for research. Mr Coleman and Dr Riddell are on the list, as is much of Pharmagene's workforce. So can Pharmagene's research replace the drugs tests on rats, mice and dogs which so many people find objectionable? Since the Thalidomide tragedy, government regulations require new medicines to be tested on animals, so at present Pharmagene's work is an additional, rather than alternative, stage. Mr Coleman says: \"Despite the similarities we have with animals, there are a huge number of differences. That's the reason so many drugs fail in clinical trials.\" He believes human tissue research should take place before animal testing, though the latter cannot be stopped completely: \"There is a continuing need for some animal testing but the challenge is to limit it to the minimum necessary.\" Perhaps Pharmagene's more immediately promising sideline is in testing where genes are expressed in the body, using the same tissue samples. The human genome project has thrown up thousands of different \"target\" genes, involved in disease mechanisms. Pharmagene can help drugs firms produce accurate drugs by pinpointing where these targets are active. More than 3,700 people have donated tissue to Pharmagene since the company was founded five years ago. Can the firm rely on a steady supply if, as expected, its business expands? Dr Riddell says: \"The only reason there could be a negative impact on us from Alder Hey is through guilt by association - because we are, in some sense, in the same sector.\" He is hopeful that the scandal will not affect long-term donations for research: \"I think not - there seems to be an undercurrent of enthusiasm for donating. But how do we really know what goes through the collective brain?\" Making the break Pharmagene was founded in 1995 by Gordon Smith Baxter, a former SmithKline Beecham executive, and Robert Coleman, a pharmacologist from Glaxo Wellcome. Frustrated at working in big organisations, they wanted to try their idea of \"facilitating the experimental use of human tissue\" in a start-up company. Revenues have risen from \u00a3430,000 in 1997 to \u00a31.26m last year, although the company warned at the end of last year that mergers such as that between Glaxo and SmithKline had caused some customers to defer payments. Pharmagene lost \u00a34.21m last year but, after raising \u00a340m in a flotation, has plenty of cash to absorb its spending of \u00a3350,000 a month. In addition to testing drugs for clients, the firm develops its own products.",

Mr Wahid said he left voluntarily after being told his colleagues wanted him to go.</p> <p>He is the second minister to leave the government in the past six weeks because of differences over Mr Wahid's often erratic style of government.</p> <p>Meanwhile tens of thousands of Mr Wahid's fanatical followers rampaged through east and central Java, the centre of his support, burning the offices of the main opposition parties in protest at the attempts to impeach their hero.</p> <p>Thousands opposed to Mr Wahid took to the city streets throughout the country, including the capital Jakarta, where 3,000 students marched peacefully to the presidential palace.</p> <p>Alvin Lie, an opposition MP who played a key role in the investigation which led to parliament beginning the impeachment procedure last Thursday by censuring the president, said he and his colleagues were \"very disappointed\" by Mr Wahid's \"very negative\" response.</p> <p>The constitution gives Mr Wahid three months to respond to the censure before parliament can issue a second and final warning.</p> <p>But Mr Lie said: \"The three months is just a grace period, a probation period. If at any time the president shows a negative response or makes mistakes, we can issue the second warning immediately.</p> <p>\"It looks like we are going to do that next week, unless the president radically changes his attitude.\"</p> <p>Ade Komaruddin, an MP for Golkar, the former government party, said MPs were still debating their next move. \"The majority of legislators want him to do the decent thing and resign immediately,\" he said.</p> <p>It is a sign of his increasing desperation that Mr Wahid tried to impose martial law last week, but his cabinet and generals refused to back him.</p> <p>\"It's clear that he's losing control,\" the political analyst Andi Mallarangeng said.</p> <p>Mr Mahendra's departure came as little surprise after his statement that he could not stay silent about the scandals. \"I am the justice minister and these were questions of law,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Wahid was censured for his alleged involvement in two multimillion-pound financial scandals.</p> <p>It is not suggested that he benefited personally, but the suggestion that he used the money for political purposes has helped the opposition to attack him for his ineffective and controversial style of governing.</p> <p>Mr Mallarangeng said other ministers, particularly from Golkar, might resign soon.</p> <p>The vice-president, Megawati Sukarnoputri, still backs Mr Wahid, but it is unclear how solid her party's support is.</p> <p>Security forces in Surabaya, the country's second city and capital of East Java, fired teargas and warning shots but were unable to hold back 30,000 demonstrators determined to destroy the Golkar provincial office yesterday.</p> <p>Many of the rioters were members of the paramilitary wing of Nahdlatul Ulama, the 30m-strong Islamic movement which Mr Wahid chaired before becoming president in October 1999.</p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4121933,00.html\">23.1.2001: Trio of Asian leaders faces trying times</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4108522,00.html\">21.12.2000: Threat of war in Indonesia's rebel province</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/indonesia/Story/0,2763,200655,00.html\">Profile: Abdurrahman Wahid</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4122383,00.html\">23.1.2001: Estrada barred from leaving Philippines</a></p> <p><b>Audio report</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0129Aglionby.ra\">29.01.2001: John Aglionby on protests in Jakarta (2min 44)</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/news/0101/29/world/world4.html\" target=\"_new\"> Related story: Wahid scandal report ready for release: Sydney Morning Herald</a><br><a href=\"http://www.dfa-deplu.go.id/background/republic/republic.html#coat\" target=\"_new&quot;\">History of Indonesia - department of foreign affairs</a><br><a href=\"http://www.sdn.or.id/sdn/sdnp-new/htdocs/link/gov.html\" target=\"_new\">Indonesian government</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "President Abdurrahman Wahid's tenuous grip on power in Indonesia weakened further yesterday when opposition MPs warned that the could reduce the process of impeaching him from months to a few weeks. Fissures in the cabinet also widened with the departure of the justice minister, Yusril Ihza Mahendra. Mr Mahendra said he had been sacked for suggesting that the president should step aside while he is investigated for alleged corruption. Mr Wahid said he left voluntarily after being told his colleagues wanted him to go. He is the second minister to leave the government in the past six weeks because of differences over Mr Wahid's often erratic style of government. Meanwhile tens of thousands of Mr Wahid's fanatical followers rampaged through east and central Java, the centre of his support, burning the offices of the main opposition parties in protest at the attempts to impeach their hero. Thousands opposed to Mr Wahid took to the city streets throughout the country, including the capital Jakarta, where 3,000 students marched peacefully to the presidential palace. Alvin Lie, an opposition MP who played a key role in the investigation which led to parliament beginning the impeachment procedure last Thursday by censuring the president, said he and his colleagues were \"very disappointed\" by Mr Wahid's \"very negative\" response. The constitution gives Mr Wahid three months to respond to the censure before parliament can issue a second and final warning. But Mr Lie said: \"The three months is just a grace period, a probation period. If at any time the president shows a negative response or makes mistakes, we can issue the second warning immediately. \"It looks like we are going to do that next week, unless the president radically changes his attitude.\" Ade Komaruddin, an MP for Golkar, the former government party, said MPs were still debating their next move. \"The majority of legislators want him to do the decent thing and resign immediately,\" he said. It is a sign of his increasing desperation that Mr Wahid tried to impose martial law last week, but his cabinet and generals refused to back him. \"It's clear that he's losing control,\" the political analyst Andi Mallarangeng said. Mr Mahendra's departure came as little surprise after his statement that he could not stay silent about the scandals. \"I am the justice minister and these were questions of law,\" he said. Mr Wahid was censured for his alleged involvement in two multimillion-pound financial scandals. It is not suggested that he benefited personally, but the suggestion that he used the money for political purposes has helped the opposition to attack him for his ineffective and controversial style of governing. Mr Mallarangeng said other ministers, particularly from Golkar, might resign soon. The vice-president, Megawati Sukarnoputri, still backs Mr Wahid, but it is unclear how solid her party's support is. Security forces in Surabaya, the country's second city and capital of East Java, fired teargas and warning shots but were unable to hold back 30,000 demonstrators determined to destroy the Golkar provincial office yesterday. Many of the rioters were members of the paramilitary wing of Nahdlatul Ulama, the 30m-strong Islamic movement which Mr Wahid chaired before becoming president in October 1999.

      "bodyText": "In the rich countries today pet-owners spend \u00a311.3bn a year on pet food while one in seven of the world's population goes to bed hungry. The growing abyss between rich and poor has become almost unimaginable: the world's three richest men have combined assets equal to the output of the world's 48 poorest countries and their 600m people. Yet as we look back on the past 50 years we can see that globalisation has also brought many benefits. Per capita food production and consumption have increased by 20%, and malnutrition rates are down by almost a third since War on Want was founded in 1951. Since the 1960s the number of babies dying before their first birthday has halved, and people in developing countries now live on average until they are 64 rather than 46 years old. But the benefits of globalisation are not distributed equally, either within or between countries. As Nelson Mandela said at the last Labour party conference: \"The danger is that globalisation can come to mean only the free flow of goods and finance, the open access to markets, the breaking down of barriers to trade and commerce. The concern for the common good, which characterised ... international solidarity ... is in danger of being lost in the current understanding of a global world.\" Many of us are angry about the inequities and suffering that threaten to tarnish the new millennium but, paradoxically, globalisation has also given us the tools to do something about it. At War on Want, our computers send daily emails full of details of strikes, protests and campaigns from Brazil to Bangkok. Email also helps us to coordinate our responses with like-minded organisations. The short-term successor to Jubilee 2000, Drop the Debt, is now housed in War on Want's building and is trying to win a new deal on third world debt by the G8 summit in Genoa in July. While governments in Africa still spend nearly three times more money servicing their debt than they do on health services, this struggle has to go on. \"Turning swords into ploughshares\" is as crucial today as it was when War on Want was founded 50 years ago, especially as the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, announced last week that Britain will continue to export arms to the Moroccan army to maintain its illegal occupation of the Western Sahara. While the Department for International Development was funding, with War on Want, the building of food warehouses for 150,000 malnourished Sahrawi refugees in neighbouring Algeria, the Foreign Office gave the go-ahead for Royal Ordnance to supply new parts for 105mm guns to Morocco. War on Want is now seeking legal advice about requesting a judicial review of the Foreign Office decision, which we believe contravened the EU code of conduct on arms exports. Our organisation was founded to combat this type of destructive violence and to wage the real war, the war against global poverty. As a tiny charity based in London, it sometimes seems that War on Want's work can only ever be a drop in the ocean. But globalisation has made international solidarity more powerful than ever. Our supporters in the UK's trade unions and the labour movement know that there is even greater need for people to work more closely with one another to confront the inequities of globalisation, and they keep alive in action our tradition of solidarity.

      "body": "<p>Britain's new e-envoy is brushing aside scathing criticism of the government's e-commerce plans and promises Whitehall is on track to meet its 2005 target. </p> <p>In an exclusive interview with Guardian Online this week, Andrew Pinder insisted all government services would be online within the next four years, meeting a deadline set by the prime minister, Tony Blair, last year. </p> <p>His assurances come despite a report from internet analyst Forrester Research, published on Friday, which cast doubt on Whitehall's ability to deliver the ambitious promises of e-government. </p> <p>Pinder has been working in a caretaker role for the past three months, after the resignation of the first e-envoy, Alex Allan. </p> <p>He says permanent appointment to the role will allow him to focus on longer-term planning. </p> <p>\"Some of the time I've been very conscious that someone else could be coming in to take over,\" he said. \"I've not been wanting to steal the limelight or take decisions which they should be taking.\" </p> <p>There had been suggestions that Pinder was reluctant to take on the role permanently; his name had not cropped up on many observers' shortlists because of his insistence that he would only take the job for the interim period. </p> <p>Now he is finally able to look more than a few months ahead there are plenty of hard decisions which need to be taken, according to Forrester Research. </p> <p>In its paper, eGovernment fails the grade, it states bluntly that \"the UK government's aggressive e-commerce plans won't come to fruition.\" It says only the intervention of the private sector will allow the government to reach its goal of 100% electronic delivery of government services to businesses and consumers. </p> <p>Worse, it grades the efforts of a sample of departments from A to E, awarding an average of D. Departments hit with an E grade include the Department of Social Security, Office of National Statistics and Customs and Excise. </p> <p>Even the online efforts of the Office of the E-envoy got a lowly D rating, beaten by the the likes of the Inland Revenue (IR) and Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), which both scored the top mark awarded - a C. </p> <p>\"Plans for delivering services are wrong-headed,\" writes Forrester analyst Caroline Sceats. </p> <p>\"Only the IR and DCMS show any understanding of the pressures the government will face as a portal in the competitive internet environment. The result: opportunities for building on strengths go to waste.\" </p> <p>The Forrester report's comments have been dismissed in some quarters as being under-researched, naive and focused on the comments of a handful of IT suppliers who would stand to benefit most from the failure of the e-government initiative and subsequent out-sourcing of work. </p> <p>Pinder, although clearly unhappy about Forrester's conclusions, prefers to be more diplomatic.

      "bodyText": "Britain's new e-envoy is brushing aside scathing criticism of the government's e-commerce plans and promises Whitehall is on track to meet its 2005 target. In an exclusive interview with Guardian Online this week, Andrew Pinder insisted all government services would be online within the next four years, meeting a deadline set by the prime minister, Tony Blair, last year. His assurances come despite a report from internet analyst Forrester Research, published on Friday, which cast doubt on Whitehall's ability to deliver the ambitious promises of e-government. Pinder has been working in a caretaker role for the past three months, after the resignation of the first e-envoy, Alex Allan. He says permanent appointment to the role will allow him to focus on longer-term planning. \"Some of the time I've been very conscious that someone else could be coming in to take over,\" he said. \"I've not been wanting to steal the limelight or take decisions which they should be taking.\" There had been suggestions that Pinder was reluctant to take on the role permanently; his name had not cropped up on many observers' shortlists because of his insistence that he would only take the job for the interim period. Now he is finally able to look more than a few months ahead there are plenty of hard decisions which need to be taken, according to Forrester Research. In its paper, eGovernment fails the grade, it states bluntly that \"the UK government's aggressive e-commerce plans won't come to fruition.\" It says only the intervention of the private sector will allow the government to reach its goal of 100% electronic delivery of government services to businesses and consumers. Worse, it grades the efforts of a sample of departments from A to E, awarding an average of D. Departments hit with an E grade include the Department of Social Security, Office of National Statistics and Customs and Excise. Even the online efforts of the Office of the E-envoy got a lowly D rating, beaten by the the likes of the Inland Revenue (IR) and Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), which both scored the top mark awarded - a C. \"Plans for delivering services are wrong-headed,\" writes Forrester analyst Caroline Sceats. \"Only the IR and DCMS show any understanding of the pressures the government will face as a portal in the competitive internet environment. The result: opportunities for building on strengths go to waste.\" The Forrester report's comments have been dismissed in some quarters as being under-researched, naive and focused on the comments of a handful of IT suppliers who would stand to benefit most from the failure of the e-government initiative and subsequent out-sourcing of work. Pinder, although clearly unhappy about Forrester's conclusions, prefers to be more diplomatic. He points to what he claims is the progress the drive is having, and the results already achieved. He is quick to reject the suggestion that the \"Sir Humphreys\" of Whitehall are intent on stalling the e-government initiative. \"I think that is rubbish,\" he says. \"The civil service is not resistant to change. There are issues with the civil service, as with any large organisation. \"One is that this is a large supertanker which takes a long time to turn, and it takes a while for people to take on board this new method of communicating. This is just as hard for people here as it is for those in the private sector. \"Take banks, for example; I don't think banks are doing any better in e-commerce than the UK public sector. \"The second issue is that the public sector is enormously diverse, with lots of sections, and trying to get people to be creative about what they do online is a big challenge - probably a bigger challenge than anyone in the private sector is having to face.\" Despite these problems, and the criticism, Pinder is confident that government will meet its 2005 deadline. \"We've had the first round of e-strategies, published on departments' websites,\" he says. \"Those strategies show that most departments are well on track to hitting the 2005 target. If people took the trouble to read that they would see it. \"The big issue for me is that we don't just want them to hit the 2005 target; we want them to do it in some style. We want them to deliver these services, not just by putting these things online, but we want them to really target these services and be much more creative, using this new medium in a different sort of way.\" And, despite Forrester's misgivings, that kind of talk appears to be what industry wants to hear. There, reaction to Pinder's appointment has been positive. Jim Norton, head of e-business at the Institute of Directors, says he is \"delighted\" by Pinder's appointment. \"I wanted someone who had both public and private sector experience and Andrew's got both of those. \"To my mind he has acquitted himself well in a difficult time - it's not an easy period when you're acting as interim.

Robert Black QC, the Edinburgh law professor who was the architect of the trial, said it was unlikely that Megrahi would be denied the right to an appeal. Last week Megrahi was sentenced to life, with a recommendation that he serve a minimum of 20 years, for the murder of the 270 who died in the Lockerbie bombing. In their ruling the judges said there was proof beyond reasonable doubt that Megrahi had planted the bomb in a suitcase on a plane leaving Luqa airport in Malta. The suitcase was loaded on to Pan Am flight 103 in London. But the judges conceded the evidence before the court was open to interpretation. Grounds for the appeal will not be made public until the full hearing, which will be held in Camp Zeist in the Netherlands in May at the earliest. But it is unlikely that there will be any fresh evidence and Prof Black said the appeal would likely be made on any of three legal grounds. Ground A would be that certain findings, including the acceptance that Megrahi bought the clothes which surrounded the bomb, were not justified by the evidence. Ground B would be that the evidence does not justify the findings in fact that there was a piece of baggage which was sent unaccompanied from Malta to Heathrow. The third ground would be that the evidence as a whole does not justify proof beyond reasonable doubt of guilt.' Since the return to Libya of Megrahi's co-accused, Al-Amin Khalifah Fhimah, who was acquitted, there have been protests against Megrahi's conviction.

      "bodyText": "A huge exhibition of works attributed to the late Francis Bacon opens today at the Barbican Gallery in London despite fears of a last minute injunction from the artist's estate. Before yesterday's preview, representatives of the estate, which jealously defends the copyright and reputation of the artist, visited the exhibition of works whose ownership and authenticity have been bitterly contested . The estate's lawyers, Payne Hicks Beach, said last night they had no comment to make. The archive has been the subject of a simmering row since Mr Bacon, regarded as one of the major painters of the 20th century, died in 1992. Both the Institute of Contemporary Arts and the then Tate Gallery considered exhibiting the archive, but backed off in the face of the unresolved dispute. Although the Barbican exhibition is peppered with the word \"attributed\", Tate Modern has given it some credibility by lending Bacon sketches, dating from the 1950s and 1960s, which it bought two years ago. A spokeswoman for Tate Modern said: \"We have lent six works on paper, totally authentic and not in any way disputed, which allow an interesting comparison to be made. Beyond that we cannot comment on the exhibition.\" John Hoole, director of the Barbican Gallery, said he has \"no doubt that the vast major ity of the works must be by Bacon\". When Mr Bacon died of a heart attack, aged 82, the sole heir of his estimated \u00a311m estate was John Edwards, an East End barman who was his companion for many years. The inheritance included the contents of his chaotic studio, which has now been reconstructed in a gallery in Dublin, the artist's birthplace. But boxes of papers were allegedly given, just four days before his death, to Barry Joule, a Canadian who was his neighbour in London and later a friend. Mr Joule said yesterday that when Mr Bacon gave him the papers, he said: \"You know what to do with it\", and that this was familiar code for a gift. Part of the Bacon mythology is that his genius poured straight on to the canvas, without any preparatory work. The hundreds of sheets of paper in the archive include hoarded photographs, clippings, pages torn from magazines and books, the medical text book illustrations which fascinated him and scribbled sketches. The photographs include images which recur in his finished work, including the screaming nurse from the Eisenstein film Battleship Potemkin. Album X is an old photograph album given him by his nanny, from which the photos were torn and replaced with heavily worked collages and overdrawn photographs. The authenticity of the archive has been questioned by David Sylvester, a leading expert on Bacon. He concedes that the sheets of paper must have come from Bacon's studio, but doubts that the overpainting and sketches are in the artist's hand. Mr Joule has been accused by other sources of betraying his friend's intentions.

      "bodyText": "Stephen Downing, who supporters claim is the victim of Britain's longest-running miscarriage of justice, was freed on bail yesterday with the expectation that his conviction for murder will be quashed. But he returned home after 27 years behind bars with a stain on his reputation after a lawyer for the prosecution claimed no one else was responsible for the crime. This was contested by his supporters - and police said no decision had been taken on whether to re-open the murder inquiry. Yesterday Mr Downing walked from Littlehey prison in Cambridgeshire, where he had been spent the last four years, to enjoy a brief moment of triumph. Grinning broadly, he said: \"I would like to thank all the public and the media for their support and help. \"I am elated and I now hope to spend some valuable time with my family.\" He shook hands with a prison officer and then left in the company of two reporters from a Sunday newspaper. Mr Downing, 44, was jailed for life in 1974 for the killing of typist Wendy Sewell, after he found her badly battered but still alive in the cemetery where he worked in Bakewell, Derbyshire. He was then 17 but had the reading age of an 11-year-old. He was convicted mainly on the basis of a confession obtained after he had been interrogated by Derbyshire police for more than seven hours, during which time he had to be shaken awake and officers took bets on whether he would confess. He was never informed by police that he was under arrest or in custody and was not told of his right to consult a solicitor. His counsel, Edward Fitz-gerald QC, told the court of appeal in London yesterday that there was strong reason to believe that he did ask for a lawyer but his request was denied. \"There is a most powerful case for saying that this conviction is unsafe,\" said Mr Fitzgerald. \"For this man, who has served 27 years, to serve a day longer would not be just.\" Julian Bevan QC, for the prosecution, said the crown accepted that the confession could have been ruled inadmissible at his trial. A full appeal hearing will not take place for at least three months but Mr Justice Pitchford, the judge who granted bail, said he agreed that Mr Downing's conviction would probably be quashed on appeal. However, his character will bear the stain of the comment by Mr Bevan, who said: \"Such investigations as have taken place into this by the criminal cases review commission do not support the assertion that another person was responsible.\" Wendy Sewell's husband David, who still lives in the house which he shared with her, was at the appeal court yesterday and seized on the comment made by Mr Bevan.

That is a standard, bedrock Palestinian view.</p> <p>It is as firmly held in Beirut's Sabra and Shatila refugee camps as anywhere else, even though the massacre that took place there 19 years ago - gen erally regarded as the most damaging such episode in Israel's history - is indelibly associated with Sharon, the defence minister during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon.</p> <p>Abu Mujahid, who runs a youth centre in Shatila, was there. On the night of September 16 1982 he could not get home past the Israel army that had laid siege to the camps.</p> <p>\"It was like daylight at night,\" he said of the flares it continuously threw up. For the next 48 hours, aided by the siege and the flares, rightwing Phalangist militiamen, Israel's Lebanese allies, went through the camps, slaughtering up to 2,000 men, women and children left defenceless by the enforced departure, a few days before, of Yasser Arafat and his guerrillas.</p> <p>When Abu Mujahid finally made it he saw \"corpses so bloated and blackened in the sun that fathers couldn't recognise their own sons, bodies torn apart and strewn about, along with dead animals, like garbage\".</p> <p>\"Sharon may have ordered this,\" he said, \"but, for me, they are still basically the same. The only difference is that when Labour kills, it pretends to regret it, while Likud does it with a smile.\"</p> <p>But for Suheil Natur, a researcher, Mr Sharon will, in fact, be much worse than Mr Barak, less because he is who he is than because of the conditions in which he has come to power.</p> <p>\"Of course,\" he said, \"the very name Sharon carries a message: 'prepare yourselves for war'.\"</p> <p>But there have been extremist prime ministers before. \"Older camp residents recall the shock they felt when Menachem Begin, leader of the pre-independence Irgun terrorist underground, came to power in 1977; to be followed later by the more extreme Yitzhak Shamir, leader of the Stern gang.</p> <p>\"The difference this time,\" he said, \"is the whole climate of extremism in Israel, the fact that the peace process is virtually dead, and the logic of violence has taken over.</p> <p>\"After Oslo we had thought that co-existence would be come possible, that the Israel peace camp would push for a reasonable Palestinian state.

But under Sharon they are going to feel real pain, pain like they have given us for 50 years; because the intifada will expand - and I think Hizbullah will get into the act too.\" The kind of peace that most of them speak about remains what it always was, a \"return\" not to an Arafat state but to what is now Israel. 07.02.2001, world dispatch: Sharon has a mountain to climb 07.02.2001: World offers Sharon a wary welcome 07.02.2001, comment: Despair as usual for Palestinians 07.02.2001: What the Israeli papers say 07.02.2001: End of road for humiliated Barak 07.02.2001: Israel gives up on peace with Sharon victory 07.02.2001: Comment: Israel's dark hour 07.02.2001: Despair as usual for Palestinians 07.02.2001: Sharon in his own words Read the full text of Sharon's victory speech Timeline Talk about it Talk to Guardian policy editor Jonathan Freedland, 3.30pm today Interactive guide An interactive history of Israel Video Ariel Sharon's victory speech, from the New York Times Audio Suzanne Goldenberg in Jerusalem: 'Barak promised peace and delivered an uprising' (2mins 53) Suzanne Goldenberg in Jerusalem: Israelis divided ahead of crucial election (2mins 35) Key players Ariel Sharon: from butcher to 'Lion' to Prime Minister of Israel Ehud Barak: the main loser Supreme test for 'Mr Palestine' From the Guardian archive 15.05.1948: Jewish state is born 19.11.1948, Arthur Koestler: Israel's the new generation Useful links Office of the Israeli Prime Minister Peace process: reference documents in full Israeli Knesset Email Barak, Sharon and Arafat Jerusalem Post Palestine Times",

      "body": "<b> Editorial, Al-Ahali Egyptian opposition weekly </b> <br> <p> There was no chance to make a preference between two similar war criminals who competed for the premiership post in Israel on Tuesday. There was no chance to make a preference between Barak, who is very bad, and Sharon who is much worse. Right now, it is clear that the division in Israel is between extremists and more extreme groups who might differ on the means, but agree on the same goal: total control of the Arab world. </p> <p><b> Rami G Khouri in the Lebanese Daily Star</b><br> </p> <p>Sharon's election will neither achieve peace with justice, not perpetually delay it. My own guess is that Sharon's victory will have the same historical impact that we witnessed when other rightwing Likud leaders assumed the political leadership of Israel in recent decades _ In each case, their tough-guy, all-this-land-belongs-to-me-because-God-gave-it-to-Abraham- Isaac-and-Jacob approach proved politically unrealistic and untenable. </p> <p><b> Al-Baath, official paper of the Baath party </b><br> </p> <p> The victory of the bloody terrorist and war criminal Sharon as head of the Israeli government is a clear message by the Zionist entity to Arabs amounting to an official declaration of war. By choosing Sharon the Israelis chose escalation, terrorism and aggression _Israel has put the fate of peace in the whole world, not only in the Middle East, under the mercy of a general who is obsessed with wars and the myth of Israel's Biblical lands extending from the river Nile to the Euphrates. </p> <p><b> Editorial, Jordan Times </b><br> </p> <p> Although Sharon is a new prime minister, he is not new as an extremist politician and a bloody army officer who is responsible for shedding lots of innocent [Arab] blood and souls. </p> <p>What concerns us here in Jordan is that Sharon built up his reputation as the man who came up with the theory that \"Jordan is Palestine\" and that it should be alternative nation for Palestinians. Although he declared recently that he gave up this theory and that he respected the peace agreement signed between Jordan and Israel (1994), we need to hear that from him again after taking over the premiership post. He must announce that \"Jordan is Jordan\". </p> <p><b> Amos Oz in Yediot Ahronoth</b><br> </p> <p> Ariel Sharon is Arafat's gift to the Israeli and Palestinian peoples. Ehud Barak was defeated in the winter of 2001 for exactly the same reason Yitzhak Rabin was murdered in the autumn of 1995, and Shimon Peres was defeated in the spring of 1996: All three were ahead of their time. </p> <p>Like many leaders in Israeli history, these three had _ what Arafat lacks: the courage to compromise and make peace even as many of their countrymen called them traitors. </p> <p><b> Hemi Shalev in Ma'ariv</b><br> </p> <p> Sharon's campaign was clever enough to obscure his problematic past and quiet any public fears about his election. His moves in the coming days will reveal whether the voters were like Little Red Riding Hood led astray by a wolf dressed like an amiable grandmother _ </p> <p>Barak wasted the national goodwill granted him in the last elections like a gambler with no God and no tomorrow. Arrogantly _ Barak led the left from the greatness of victory to the anguish of defeat. By linking his own fate to that of the policy he helmed, Barak turned out to be a millstone that now threatens to sink the peace process entirely.\" </p> <p><b> Yoel Marcus on Ariel Sharon in the Ha'aretz </b><br> </p> <p> The time for tractor rides with your grandchildren is over.

      "bodyText": "Editorial, Al-Ahali Egyptian opposition weekly There was no chance to make a preference between two similar war criminals who competed for the premiership post in Israel on Tuesday. There was no chance to make a preference between Barak, who is very bad, and Sharon who is much worse. Right now, it is clear that the division in Israel is between extremists and more extreme groups who might differ on the means, but agree on the same goal: total control of the Arab world. Rami G Khouri in the Lebanese Daily Star Sharon's election will neither achieve peace with justice, not perpetually delay it. My own guess is that Sharon's victory will have the same historical impact that we witnessed when other rightwing Likud leaders assumed the political leadership of Israel in recent decades _ In each case, their tough-guy, all-this-land-belongs-to-me-because-God-gave-it-to-Abraham- Isaac-and-Jacob approach proved politically unrealistic and untenable. Al-Baath, official paper of the Baath party The victory of the bloody terrorist and war criminal Sharon as head of the Israeli government is a clear message by the Zionist entity to Arabs amounting to an official declaration of war. By choosing Sharon the Israelis chose escalation, terrorism and aggression _Israel has put the fate of peace in the whole world, not only in the Middle East, under the mercy of a general who is obsessed with wars and the myth of Israel's Biblical lands extending from the river Nile to the Euphrates. Editorial, Jordan Times Although Sharon is a new prime minister, he is not new as an extremist politician and a bloody army officer who is responsible for shedding lots of innocent [Arab] blood and souls. What concerns us here in Jordan is that Sharon built up his reputation as the man who came up with the theory that \"Jordan is Palestine\" and that it should be alternative nation for Palestinians. Although he declared recently that he gave up this theory and that he respected the peace agreement signed between Jordan and Israel (1994), we need to hear that from him again after taking over the premiership post. He must announce that \"Jordan is Jordan\". Amos Oz in Yediot Ahronoth Ariel Sharon is Arafat's gift to the Israeli and Palestinian peoples. Ehud Barak was defeated in the winter of 2001 for exactly the same reason Yitzhak Rabin was murdered in the autumn of 1995, and Shimon Peres was defeated in the spring of 1996: All three were ahead of their time. Like many leaders in Israeli history, these three had _ what Arafat lacks: the courage to compromise and make peace even as many of their countrymen called them traitors. Hemi Shalev in Ma'ariv Sharon's campaign was clever enough to obscure his problematic past and quiet any public fears about his election. His moves in the coming days will reveal whether the voters were like Little Red Riding Hood led astray by a wolf dressed like an amiable grandmother _ Barak wasted the national goodwill granted him in the last elections like a gambler with no God and no tomorrow. Arrogantly _ Barak led the left from the greatness of victory to the anguish of defeat. By linking his own fate to that of the policy he helmed, Barak turned out to be a millstone that now threatens to sink the peace process entirely.\" Yoel Marcus on Ariel Sharon in the Ha'aretz The time for tractor rides with your grandchildren is over. You can take off the makeup and get rid of the plastic smile. You won't have 100 days of grace, not even 100 hours. Hopefully, while you were keeping your mouth shut and the voters were asleep, you thought and planned what kind of prime minister you wanted to be.

      "bodyText": "The government yesterday tried to take the sting out of its rejection of a report urging reform of drugs laws by announcing that the 50,000 offenders cautioned each year for cannabis possession will not be given criminal records in the future. Ministers announced that they intend to change the legislation on the rehabilitation of offenders to ensure that the cautions 266,000 people receive each year for all offences, including drugs, will not have to be declared to employers or when travelling abroad. They also agreed they would review sentencing to ensure that those who are caught selling drugs to a few friends are not treated as harshly as professional dealers. Home Office ministers have been criticised for their rejection of the 24 main recommendations of the report of the Police Foundation inquiry into the state of Britain's drugs laws. The home secretary, Jack Straw, finally announced his \"considered response\" to the landmark report of the inquiry, chaired by Dame Ruth Runciman and which included two serving chief constables. Mr Straw confirmed yesterday that he had rejected its key recommendations to end the imprisonment of those convicted of cannabis possession and for a less serious classification of drugs such as ecstasy and LSD, which are bracketed with heroin and cocaine. The inquiry argued that the criminal penalties for cannabis possession often did more harm than the drug itself. The Home Office response yesterday said it was necessary to keep a prison sentence on the statute book for simple possession of cannabis as \"an important backstop to ensure that defendants appear in court\" and \"as an incentive to treatment\". Ministers agreed with the Police Foundation that ecstasy was less toxic than heroin or cocaine but said that when, three years ago, the advisory council on the misuse of drugs discussed its status it concluded that it posed \"very real risks of fits, seizures, mental disturbances and death\". It also identified possible longer-term risks to mental health. Similarly, on LSD the Home Office agreed it was less dangerous than heroin or cocaine but said it should remain a class A drug because \"a bad trip is impossible to predict and can be terrifying\". The official Home Office response adds: \"Users may be prone to accidents while they are hallucinating and they experience flash backs, often some considerable time after the event.\" It also warned that LSD can complicate mental problems such as depression, anxiety and schizophrenia. One result of the report, however, is that an anti-drug driving publicity campaign - similar to the familiar drink- drive advertisements - is to be launched by the transport authorities. But the rejection of the landmark report dismayed drugs law reform campaigners. The head of the inquiry, Lady Runciman, said: \"It is disappointing that a real opportunity for constructive dialogue and incremental change has been missed. All our most far-reaching recommendations have been rejected. At no point has the rationale underlying the proposals been addressed. It leaves us with a law that is out of touch with reality.

The Home Office and the Department of Health were very clear that \"once the outcome of the trials is clear, we will act expeditiously to ensure that any approved treatment can be brought into circulation\".

      "bodyText": "President Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine was fighting for his political life yesterday after the general prosecutor's office ended months of stonewalling to confirm that audio tapes indicating presidential complicity in the murder of an opposition journalist were genuine. The announcement came a day after thousands of anti-Kuchma demonstrators marched in Kiev, denouncing the sump of corruption that is the presidential court, only to be met by masked thugs breaking up the \"tent city\" established by protesters on the capital's main shopping street. The threats to Mr Kuchma's political survival grew as leading opposition figures in Ukraine's notoriously fractious political scene announced they were uniting on an anti-Kuchma platform. But the biggest threat to his hold on power came with the confirmation by the general prosecutor's office that Mr Kuchma's voice was on the tapes at the heart of the so-called Gongadze scandal. Georgy Gongadze, the editor of a Ukrainian internet newspaper which focused on corruption, disappeared in September and a beheaded corpse, believed to be his, was found in a forest outside Kiev in November. After denying that the corpse was Gongadze's, then spinning out the investigation to play for time, the authorities now say it is more than 99% certain that the missing journalist was murdered and that the beheaded body was, in fact, his. A presidential bodyguard covertly recorded conversations in the presidential office, purporting to show Mr Kuchma, the interior minister and senior security officials using profane language while discussing a kidnapping operation to get rid of the \"nuisance\" journalist. Mr Kuchma has persistently denied the allegations, but international pressure on him is increasing and a protest movement dubbed \"Ukraine Without Kuchma\" is gaining ground. Meanwhile, former political allies are jumping ship, joining the opposition pushing for his impeachment. After weeks of contradictory statements from the general prosecutor's office, widely seen as an attempted cover-up, the deputy general prosecutor, Alexei Bahanets, said yesterday that Mr Kuchma, the interior minister, the secret service chief, and the president's chief of staff had all been questioned about the tapes and had confirmed that their voices could indeed be heard on them. He also said that while the voices were genuine, the tapes had been doctored, and the president still denied that the incriminating evidence on the Gongadze case was authentic. On Monday an MP, Serhy Holovaty, said Mr Kuchma had told him the tapes were genuine. \"I admit that Melnychenko's recordings are true. It is true that I have been recorded. I admit it,\" Mr Holovaty quoted Mr Kuchma as saying. The recordings were made by the former presidential bodyguard Mykhailo Melnychenko, who placed a digital recorder under a sofa in the president's office. He fled the country with his family after the general prosecutor's office issued an arrest warrant. Mr Melnychenko is believed to be in Prague and the Council of Europe has issued a statement demanding that none of its members extradite him to Ukraine. The general prosecutor, Mykhailo Potebenko, said at first that the tapes were a fabrication. Then he announced that even if they were real, they were illegally obtained and could not therefore be produced in court. Then he ordered Mr Melnychenko's arrest. Last Friday Mr Pote benko was put on six weeks' compulsory leave, finally admitting before he left that the tapes could be real.

Those in the small crowd on Tianshan Road in Shanghai laugh at his efforts to mimic the distinctive hand exercises Falun Gong members use in meditation. It is one of very few laughs in the amateur street theatre show Pro-Science and Anti-Heresy, staged on the steps of the Tianshan Cinema in a dampening drizzle. Some smaller children chant a little ditty, punctuated by wooden clappers, to the effect that the Falun Gong is an evil \"cult\" and its master, Li Hongzhi, is a wicked man. The children, members of the junior youth league, salute at the end of their number. A group of young women sing of \"the benefits of science\". They wear coloured blouses and scarves, like the operatic heroines of the famed Cultural Revolution. Later they change into yellow sweatshirts and trousers to round off the show with a sedate fan dance, heralding China's \"advance into a new age\". The Tianshan Road show is part of a national campaign to mobilise public opinion against the Falun Gong, 18 months after it was banned. Details of last month's group suicide attempt in Tiananmen Square, and evidence that the four women and one man who set themselves alight were supporters of the sect, feature prominently in the campaign. Falun Gong spokesmen abroad insist that the movement had nothing to do with the protest, in which one person died.

The difference is that in China today the masses choose whether they want to to watch.

Other Shanghainese say they are appalled by the suicide attempt but are also alienated by the government's heavy-handed propaganda. A local official admits that there is a \"small number\" of Falun Gong adherents in the area.

      "body": "<p>As John Major found to his cost in September 1992, global financial speculation is an almost irresistible force. Governments can find their economic strategies in tatters when the markets lose confidence and rush for the exit.</p> <p>For Britain, the exit from the exchange rate mechanism was beneficial, but for less developed countries the aftermath of defeat at the hands of the speculators has been more people in poverty, cancelled surgical operations and a rise in the number of children not in school.</p> <p>As the 1990s wore on, the number of countries affected by financial crises grew. Mexico in early 1995, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and South Korea in 1997, Russia in 1998, Brazil in 1999 were the main focus of the speculative attacks, but other countries - the Czech Republic and South Africa, for example - found their currencies under fire.</p> <p>One consequence of the increase in both the number and the severity of the financial crises has been renewed interest in the work of an American economics professor, James Tobin, on a tax on speculation. War on Want has become one of the main proponents of the so-called Tobin tax.</p> <p>Professor Tobin floated the idea in a series of lectures at Princeton in 1972. This was when the post-war system of fixed exchange rates backed by controls on the free movement of money was collapsing and the search was on for a new framework of international economic management.</p> <p>As Prof Tobin has freely admitted, the idea did not find much support in the 1970s, when the vogue was for deregulation and fewer restrictions on markets. \"It did not make much of a ripple. In fact, one might say it sank like a rock.\"</p> <p>In most central banks and finance ministries, extreme scepticism about the Tobin tax persists to this day. Prof Tobin quotes Otmar Issing, then chief economist at the German Bundesbank and now a member of the board of the European central bank, as saying of the plan for a tax on speculation: \"Oh, that again.

      "bodyText": "As John Major found to his cost in September 1992, global financial speculation is an almost irresistible force. Governments can find their economic strategies in tatters when the markets lose confidence and rush for the exit. For Britain, the exit from the exchange rate mechanism was beneficial, but for less developed countries the aftermath of defeat at the hands of the speculators has been more people in poverty, cancelled surgical operations and a rise in the number of children not in school. As the 1990s wore on, the number of countries affected by financial crises grew. Mexico in early 1995, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and South Korea in 1997, Russia in 1998, Brazil in 1999 were the main focus of the speculative attacks, but other countries - the Czech Republic and South Africa, for example - found their currencies under fire. One consequence of the increase in both the number and the severity of the financial crises has been renewed interest in the work of an American economics professor, James Tobin, on a tax on speculation. War on Want has become one of the main proponents of the so-called Tobin tax. Professor Tobin floated the idea in a series of lectures at Princeton in 1972. This was when the post-war system of fixed exchange rates backed by controls on the free movement of money was collapsing and the search was on for a new framework of international economic management. As Prof Tobin has freely admitted, the idea did not find much support in the 1970s, when the vogue was for deregulation and fewer restrictions on markets. \"It did not make much of a ripple. In fact, one might say it sank like a rock.\" In most central banks and finance ministries, extreme scepticism about the Tobin tax persists to this day. Prof Tobin quotes Otmar Issing, then chief economist at the German Bundesbank and now a member of the board of the European central bank, as saying of the plan for a tax on speculation: \"Oh, that again. It's the Loch Ness Monster, popping up once more.\" But to Prof Tobin and his supporters the tax has two big plus points. They believe that if short-term flows of capital were taxed at the rate of about 0.25% per transaction it would not only \"throw sand in the wheels\" of international speculation but also provide $250bn or so a year that could be redistributed from western financial institutions to the developing world. Steve Tibbett, a senior campaigner for War on Want, said: \"The overriding reason we have campaigned so hard on the Tobin tax to be introduced as part of a raft of measures to help stabilise the world economy is because of the devastating effect of the last major financial crisis on our partners. \"We felt strongly that the Tobin tax was one of the few proposals around that had widespread political support combined with a wide appeal. As a campaigning tool it has the advantage of being a relatively neat, simple and direct way of tempering what is probably one of the least regulated global markets. \"The revenue-raising aspect also helps.\" War on Want can claim support for its campaign in various trade unions, a host of voluntary agencies and more than 100 MPs. Even so, the chances of the international community levying the tax any time soon are remote. Why should that be?

The accusation was made by Aslef, the train drivers' union, after Rail Safety confirmed that Mr Osborne was doing both jobs and said that it was a \"legitimate\" appointment. The concern expressed by Aslef and several train operating companies is that Mr Osborne's position as secretary to both companies could be compromised. Rail Safety was established by Railtrack to distance itself from direct involvement in safety issues pending the outcome of Lord Cullen's inquiry into the Paddington crash. Railtrack faced considerable criticism from the government that it should not be responsible for investigating safety issues involving the company. Mr Osborne's new position came under further examination yesterday after it was disclosed that he signed a memorandum from Railtrack attacking the government's plan for legislation to name individual directors in corporate manslaughter charges. Mick Rix, general secretary of Aslef, said: \"Sharing a secretary with Railtrack must inevitably compromise Rail Safety's independence. \"It is a particularly inappropriate that a senior rail safety official should be representing a company against the government's corporate manslaughter proposals.\" Mr Rix said: \"This reinforces our view that railway safety supervision should be separated from Railtrack completely.\" Rail Safety said that, as Railtrack's company secretary, it was legitimate for Mr Osborne to carry out both jobs.

The Cammell board is planning to discuss which yards in north-west and north-east England could be shut if there is no decision or the government refuses help. \"We have no choice but to take action,\" Mr Kelly told the industry secretary in his letter. The Birkenhead base - at which the Luxus vessels would be constructed - is unlikely to close immediately but smaller yards on Merseyside, Tyneside and Teeside will probably go. Luxus has signed a letter of intent for the \u00a3350m vessels but will proceed with a firm contract only if the government delivers certain guarantees. Proposals made so far by the DTI have failed to break the logjamand Mr Royle is unwilling to wait much longer for a new DTI offer. \"We are talking to French and other foreign yards and we will place the order wherever the best offer is made for Luxus,\" he said. Cammell has been in trouble since since a \u00a350m deal to lengthen a cruise ship for the Italian cruise ship company, Costa Crociere, was cancelled at the last minute. By the time the deal was suspended, Cammell had already spent \u00a334m building a mid-ship section that was rejected for allegedly shoddy workmanship. The charge is rejected by Cammell amid threats of legal action. John Stafford, the chief executive who was architect of a renaissance at Cammell, resigned last week after the company announced first-half losses of \u00a33.5m compared to \u00a37.7m profits for the same period last year. Cammell has been a market favourite but its stock has fallen from a year's high of 147p to 10p in recent months after the City took fright at a foreign investment strategy followed by the Italian debacle. Last night the shares ended down 0.25p at \u00a314.25.",

The camera also features an updated version of Fuji's controversial Super CCD, which uses interpolation technology to allegedly increase image resolution, in this instance up to 6.0 megapixels. The model also features a 3x optical zoom and stores images on its accompanying 16MB SmartMedia card. Its price is likely to be around \u00a3700. </p> <p>A cosmetically-similar, though lower specified version, the FinePix 4800 Zoom, which has a megapixel count of 2.4 and can store up to 80 seconds of video, goes on sale in June for around \u00a3500. </p> <p>Also due in the summer is the FinePix 2300, a budget model with a resolution of 2.1 megapixels that stores images on embedded flash memory. </p> <p><strong> Olympus zoom in for nice pair</strong><br> Olympus has kicked off 2001 with a pair of top-end digital cameras aimed at the serious amateur photographer. </p> <p>In the stores now are the \u00a3800 Camedia C-3040 Zoom and the \u00a3500 Camedia C-2040 Zoom. The C-3040 is the successor to last year's C-3030 model - one of the first cameras to offer 3.4 megapixel resolution images. </p> <p>The 2001 version keeps both the traditional styling of its predecessor and its 1/1.8inch 3.4 megapixel CCD (image sensor). However Olympus has added an enhanced 2.5x digital zoom (in addition to the 3x optical zoom) and has updated the camera's JPEG movie shooting/editing facilities by offering the option of disabling sound while shooting video. The camera also sports manual facilities, including white balance and exposure and comes with a 16MB SmartMedia card. </p> <p>Also new from Olympus is the \u00a3500 Camedia C-2040 Zoom, a mid-market camera that has a resolution of 2.11 megapixels, a 3x optical and 2.5x digital zoom and an 8MB SmartMedia card. </p> <p><strong> Sharp's slim screens scoop</strong><br> Sharp has announced three additions to its range of ultra-slim LCD TVs. Due on sale in the summer are the 13inch LC-13C2, 15inch LC-15C2 and 20 inch LC-20C2. These join Sharp's existing trio of models which are starting to arrive in the stores in limited quantities. </p> <p>All three new models sport conventional 4x3 shaped screens (widescreen versions are expected in 2002), boast a 160 degree viewing angle and feature integrated speakers, sockets and an analogue TV tuner. Picture resolution from the black TFT LCD panel screens is rated at 921,600 pixels. The models are finished in silver and are accompanied by a small floor stand, although they can also be hung on a wall. Prices are expected to be around \u00a31,500 for the 13inch model, \u00a32,000 for the 15inch and \u00a34,000 for the 20inch. </p> <p><strong> Record break into Europe</strong> <br> RecordTV, the controversial internet based-VCR system, may soon be coming to Europe. The company has confirmed that it is has been in talks with German media giant Bertelsmann with a view to offering programmes available via the web. Users simply state what they want to record and then watch the programmes online at their own convenience. The move is indicative of Bertelsmann's recent approaches to web companies. Several months ago it also sealed an alliance with on-line music swapping service Napster.

      "body": "<p><strong> How is Radio 1 embracing net culture?</strong> We've had a Radio 1 station site since 1995-96. I see the net as a natural extension of our brand and we can engage with our audience online in new ways. We've set out to have the best understanding of our target 15-24 audience bar none - getting it right means knowing all about their favourite sites and incorporating the Radio 1 site seamlessly into on-air features. </p> <p><strong> Is the net changing the way people approach radio? </strong> Certain characteristics are universally appealing about radio, such as its intimate, one-to-one relationship. However, the net is enhancing that relationship. There's far more choice. I regularly listen to a range of US stations from the Philadelphia public service channel WHLM to KROC in LA. There's also a new depth of relationship you can build with listeners who are viewing the site. </p> <p><strong> Has technology such as MP3 damaged or liberated the music industry? </strong> That depends on who you listen to! Most people understand that, in the longer term, MP3 and Napster-style file sharing systems challenge the current distribution and revenue models. That doesn't mean the end for the industry. Given a new model, such as subscription, the core skills that the industry brings - A&amp;R, production and marketing - remain and the new technology is liberating.

      "bodyText": "How is Radio 1 embracing net culture? We've had a Radio 1 station site since 1995-96. I see the net as a natural extension of our brand and we can engage with our audience online in new ways. We've set out to have the best understanding of our target 15-24 audience bar none - getting it right means knowing all about their favourite sites and incorporating the Radio 1 site seamlessly into on-air features. Is the net changing the way people approach radio? Certain characteristics are universally appealing about radio, such as its intimate, one-to-one relationship. However, the net is enhancing that relationship. There's far more choice. I regularly listen to a range of US stations from the Philadelphia public service channel WHLM to KROC in LA. There's also a new depth of relationship you can build with listeners who are viewing the site. Has technology such as MP3 damaged or liberated the music industry? That depends on who you listen to! Most people understand that, in the longer term, MP3 and Napster-style file sharing systems challenge the current distribution and revenue models. That doesn't mean the end for the industry. Given a new model, such as subscription, the core skills that the industry brings - A&amp;R, production and marketing - remain and the new technology is liberating. Some senior people in the industry see themselves in the business of identifying talent and helping that talent make and market the best music. Not shifting plastic discs about the planet! What was your first introduction to computers? I was a sound engineer in the 1980s and a lot of the kit had computer interfaces.

      "bodyText": "NHS rationing of Viagra and other drug treatments for impotence is endangering men's health since the condition is often an early sign of dangerous illness, a coalition of doctors and patients said yesterday. The \"unfair and irrational\" restrictions put on Viagra's use nearly two years ago meant that only about a fifth of those who would benefit were getting free treatment. Government fears that wider NHS prescription would help to send its drug bill soaring were ill-founded, said the campaigners, responding to a government review of its rules. Confusion about such drugs' availability was instead helping to deter men - always reluctant visitors at GPs' surgeries - even to report health problems to doctors. John Chisholm, chairman of the British Medical Association's GP committee, said: \"Erectile dysfunction is a highly distressing condition that has very considerable effects not just on men's lives, but on their relationships, their partners and families. \"It not only causes problems in sexual performance but leads to anxiety, depression, even on occasions suicide. We should not lightly dismiss the significance of the condition by regarding it as trivial, or a bit of a joke.\" GPs are allowed to prescribe impotence drugs for a dozen conditions, including diabetes, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, polio and prostate cancer, and to refer patients with all conditions to specialist consultants where they are suffering \"severe distress\". But campaigners said this was adding to outpatient waiting lists. The government's recommended treatment for Viagra is one tablet a week, and most GPs start patients on a pack of four 25mg tablets, costing \u00a316.59. Up to 10% of men may suffer impotence problems at some stage in their lives, said campaigners. There was no evidence that overwhelming demand would \"bankrupt\" the NHS, and more treatments would save money on treating social consequences of impotence, including alcohol abuse and absenteeism. Ian Banks, chairman of the Men's Health Forum, said that at present men on average saw GPs only half as often as women. \"Men will be even less likely to attend in these conditions.

Sir Alan left the court sobbing just as Richard Rampton QC opened the case against the Daily Mail, which alleged in an article in December 1999 that he had refused to give any money to team manager George Graham for players. Mr Rampton told the jury that Sir Alan was never involved in the buying and selling of players and that he would explain to the court in his evidence today that he knows little about football. He said the article was not just sensational but nasty, and was a direct attack on Sir Alan's reputation. The article, written by Daily Mail journalist Jeff Powell, was headlined \"Why miserly Sugar must come out of his counting house and give George the money\".

Speed cameras have been effective on road safety but speeding needs to be made as socially unacceptable as drink-driving, said Richard Brunstrom, the North Wales chief constable. He is coordinating a two-year Association of Chief Police Officers' scheme, launched last April in eight police forces, in which speeding fines are recycled to buy more cameras. Approximately 3,500 people are killed on Britain's roads each year in accidents largely caused by speeding. \"We need many more cameras and for them to be more visible,\" he told the all-party parliamentary group for road safety at the House of Commons. \"They ought to be bright yellow with locations published in the newspapers so that people know where they are and why they are there ... They need to know the consequences, which include losing your licence.\" The pilot scheme in Northamptonshire, which tries to educate drivers about the dangers of speeding in addition to enforcing fines and introducing better road signs and layouts approaching accident black spots, has led to a drop in road deaths. Last year 55 people were killed on Northamptonshire's roads, down from 76 in 1999. Pilot projects are at present being run in Essex, Northampton, Thames Valley, Nottingham, South Wales, Cleveland, Lincolnshire and Strathclyde. It is hoped the scheme can be extended across most of England and Wales if the vehicles (crime) bill becomes law in April. Vince Yearley, of the Institute of Advanced Motorists, said the cameras should be \"brightly coloured with flashing signs underneath saying what the road speed is at that point ...

He refused to name any of the uncharitable firms at this stage, but the NCVO published case studies of successful partnerships between voluntary organisations and firms including NatWest, Avon Cosmetics and Kind Direct, a distributor of goods donated by firms to charities. The NCVO manifesto said the government should set a target for UK businesses to give 1% of their profits to charity, worth \u00a31.25bn a year. Business in the Community, a group of 700 socially responsible firms, said the NCVO figures underestimated firms' investment of time and money in community projects. David Blunkett, education and employment secretary, announced further concessions for charities in addition to a promise on Tuesday to scrap a \u00a310-\u00a315 charge for security checks on volunteers.",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair today laughed off the media frenzy over his announcement that a decision on a referendum on the euro could be held within two years of the next election. As ministers settled around the cabinet table for their weekly meeting, the prime minister joked about the morning papers, saying that he only wished he could secure the same coverage for his more earnest pronouncements. Downing Street has attempted over the past 48 hours to dismiss the significance of Mr Blair's announcement that he would assess whether Britain was ready to join the euro within two years of a Labour election victory. \"This was a statement of the blindingly obvious,\" one source said. There is no doubt, however, that Mr Blair's remarks about the euro in the Commons yesterday were an important clarification of the government's position on the euro which - ministers hope - will pave the way for Labour to enter the general election campaign with a clearer position on the issue. By indicating exactly when Gordon Brown will assess his cherished economic tests, Downing Street hopes to clear the decks for Labour to concentrate on education, crime and health during the campaign. The Tories made clear this morning that they are determined to unsettle Mr Blair's plans by exploiting voters' fears over the euro. Michael Portillo, the shadow chancellor, said on the Today programme that voters, who are overwhelmingly opposed to the euro, would be increasingly attracted by the Tory policy to rule out British membership for the lifetime of the next parliament. \"They have absolute certainty that if they elect a Conservative government, the Conservative government will keep the pound,\" Mr Portillo said. Tories are saying privately that they are delighted by the furore over the euro which has ensured that the prime minister's lunchtime speech on education has received less attention than Downing Street had hoped. In the speech, delivered at a new secondary school built with private money in the Labour marginal seat of Enfield Southgate, the prime minister made clear that he is in full election mode. He made a series of major announcements on education, pledging to double the number of specialist schools in the next five years to 1,500. The schools will also cover three new areas - science, engineering and enterprise. The prime minister also set out his philosophy for what he hopes will be the first second term in Labour's history. \"It is time for a second phase of New Labour, defined less by reference to the old Labour party than by an agenda for the country, radically but firmly in the centre ground,\" he said. Downing Street said that Mr Blair believes his success in running the economy in its first term means that today's Labour party no longer has to prove it has moved on from the days of Callaghan and Wilson. This will allow the government to stake out territories which were once seen as mutually exclusive - achieving social justice while promoting an enterprise economy. If the prime minister can ram home his attractive message between now and polling day, he should be on course for an historic victory. But the excitement over the euro shows that the Tories will do their best to knock him off course.

It also has the highest number of don't knows in any of the 15 member states. New figures released today show a country still more sceptical than any other about the value of membership, the European Commission, support for the euro - just 21% - and a common foreign policy. The latest Eurobarometer poll also shows that Britain has the lowest levels of support, 31%, for enlargement, a potential problem for a government which has set itself up as an \"unashamed champion\" of membership for 12 aspiring candidates from eastern and central Europe. Britain also comes out second lowest in the two remaining categories, scoring 30%, slightly more than Sweden, on the benefits of EU membership and with 51%, just ahead of Finland, in support of a common defence policy. Intriguingly, however, backing for European defence has increased by 2% since last year's row over the creation of an EU rapid reaction force (RRF), which the Tories have repeatedly warned could un dermine Nato. Unusually for a sensitive European issue, the government adopted a robust tone in rebuffing opposition claims on the RRF, suggesting that such an approach could pay dividends elsewhere. Today's findings, a foretaste of a more detailed set to be published in April, continue a now familiar pattern, and one that is depressing for europhiles. But the uniquely high incidence of don't knows appears to suggest that there is much to play for in the European debate in Britain in advance of a spring general election and a likely decision on a referendum on euro membership within two years of the next parliament. British don't knows are up to 35% and never lower than 16%. The average number of don't know replies in Britain to each question was 26%, compared to an EU average of 16% and 7% in Denmark. Neil Kinnock, the British vice-president of the European commission, said yesterday: \"Vast numbers of people feel they don't have enough information about the EU and want to know more. \"That is a sad commentary after 26 years of membership.

Thirty-two per cent believe their country has not benefited from EU membership, while 21% are don't knows. Overall support for the euro fell slightly by 3% to an average of 55%. Britain's 21% was down one point against the previous poll. There was a significant drop in support for the euro in Sweden, down 12% to 26%, probably the effect of last September's no result in the referendum in Denmark. Support for the euro in Ireland, where there has been sharp criticism from Brussels and the European Central Bank about the dangers to euroland of an overheating economy, rose by 6% to 69%.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair dramatically clarified his plans to take Britain into the single currency yesterday when he promised that a re-elected Labour government would decide within two years whether to hold a referendum. He promised the Treasury's assessment of the five economic tests for entry would be held within two years but vowed he would not bounce the British electorate by making the assessment within months of the election. It is the first time Mr Blair has defined the government's previously vague timescale to make the assessment \"early\" in the next parliament. He made the commitment in answer to a question from William Hague during prime minister's questions in the Commons. Mr Blair told a startled Mr Hague: \"Early in the next parliament means exactly what it says. Early in the next parliament would, of course, be within two years.\" If the prime minister had said the economic assessment might be held later than two years after the election, it would have opened the serious possibility of Britain not entering the euro within the next parliament. On the assumption that the Treasury concluded the British economy had met the five tests - especially that the British and European economies had converged - a Labour government would still have to hold a referendum, prepare notes and coins as well as negotiate with the EU on the entry rate for sterling against the euro. Alastair Campbell, the prime minister's press spokesman, said the referendum could be held within two years, but did not commit the government to this timetable. Mr Blair's remarks reflect a new confidence about the euro within government after its rise on the markets. Pro-euro cabinet ministers, including Stephen Byers and Robin Cook, have also noted the clear statements from car chiefs that they will disinvest unless there is a real prospect of sterling joining the euro. They were eager not to allow any backsliding from the policy after the resignation of the pro-European Peter Mandelson. Mr Hague later claimed that Mr Blair had \"just blown his policy on the single currency out of the water\" and \"given the pound two years to live\". He added: \"There can be no doubt that the fate of the pound will be a huge issue at the election.\" Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy led pro-Europeans in welcoming the move, but claimed it was too late. Even a pro-euro cabinet decision in 2002 would leave little time to complete the nuts-and-bolts moves to join the euro before the 2005-6 election, some experts warned. Eurosceptic claims that Mr Blair had effectively slapped down his chancellor, Gordon Brown, were dismissed by both Downing Street and the Treasury. Mr Blair will today put the creation of a meritocratic Britain at the top of Labour's priorities - and identify university elitism as a crucial barrier to be demolished. Following Mr Brown's attack last year on Oxbridge elitism, ministers have negotiated a package with 27 universities which currently recruit less than 80% of their students from state schools. All 27 will be monitored for year-on-year improvement as targeted schools also get extra help to raise their pupils' expectations, part of a drastic makeover for the comprehensive system to extol choice and diversity over regimentation. With Labour headquarters at Millbank gearing up for the expected May 3 election, the prime minister will use a speech at a north London school today to make a determined effort to persuade voters that, if re-elected, Labour will use its growing self-confidence and national affluence to be more radical than it has been since 1997. The cabinet remains committed to reform of the public services as the centrepiece of its campaign. To ram home his message Mr Blair will today promise to match his ambitious plans for transport and the NHS with sweeping 10-year plans to revitalise both education and the criminal justice system. The education plan will be unveiled next week, the crime plan later in the month as part of a flurry of announcements which precede Mr Brown's cautiously generous budget, probably on March 6 or 13. Today the prime minister will argue that better public service - above all, education - provides the best means to break down the barriers to what he will call \"a true meritocracy where people can rise according to their own ability\".

Miss Peters to say the least is highly unusual. It rings accord with me, what the jury has written.\"</p> <p>Peters, of Canning Town, east London, made a string of threatening phone calls to Ms Piper after she attended a performance of Channel 5's Pepsi Chart Show hosted by Ms Piper. She said that the singer had given her a \"sly dirty look\". Her response was to make 13 telephone calls last August to the star's record company in which she threatened to dismember and burn the pop star, decapitate her parents and shoot her on stage. She also abused Ms Piper's then boyfriend Richard Neville, a singer with the band 5ive.</p> <p>In one of the calls Peters said: \"Billie Piper's head needs cutting off, she needs decapitating and killing.

      "bodyText": "A disturbed fan who subjected Billie Piper to a campaign of \"calculated viciousness\" was yesterday convicted of making five threats to kill the 18-year-old pop singer and four threats against her parents. In an unusual move the jury at Blackfriars crown court requested that Juliet Peters, 32 who lives alone and has not worked for 10 years, should receive \"help\". In a note to Judge Brian Pryor QC they said: \"We would like to make the recommendation for Miss Peters to receive help from a psychiatrist or counsellor.\" Peters, who told the court that she sleeps during the day and is awake at night, was described by a psychologist of having below average intelligence, but she did not suffer from a mental disorder. Remanding Peters in custody until March 2 for psychiatric reports, Judge Pryor said: \"I have been pondering about this myself. Miss Peters to say the least is highly unusual. It rings accord with me, what the jury has written.\" Peters, of Canning Town, east London, made a string of threatening phone calls to Ms Piper after she attended a performance of Channel 5's Pepsi Chart Show hosted by Ms Piper. She said that the singer had given her a \"sly dirty look\". Her response was to make 13 telephone calls last August to the star's record company in which she threatened to dismember and burn the pop star, decapitate her parents and shoot her on stage. She also abused Ms Piper's then boyfriend Richard Neville, a singer with the band 5ive. In one of the calls Peters said: \"Billie Piper's head needs cutting off, she needs decapitating and killing. She needs her body set on fire, and her body burnt to cinders ... so we don't have to suffer her anymore.\" Another call said: \"Billie Piper is a bloody pig and I am going to kill her parents. I see them out shopping all the time. They're going to get their heads cut off soon. The silly cow is a silly bitch, she is going to be dead.\" In another Peters said: \"Next time she appears on stage she is going to be shot dead.\" In another she said: \"She needs cutting into little pieces and petrol poured over her and just burned. I'll get a gun and shoot her parent's head off ... one bullet to the head should do it.\" Ms Piper told the jury: \"They [the calls] were just horrific.

The 22-acre plot is expected to cost \u00a37m, with the stadium costing a further \u00a328m.",

In an exclusive interview with Guardian Online this week, Andrew Pinder insisted all government services would be online within the next four years, meeting a deadline set by the prime minister, Tony Blair, last year. His assurances come despite a report from internet analyst Forrester Research, published on Friday, which cast doubt on Whitehall 's ability to deliver the ambitious promises of e-government. Pinder has been working in a caretaker role for the past three months, after the resignation of the first e-envoy, Alex Allan. He says permanent appointment to the role will allow him to focus on longer-term planning. \"Some of the time I've been very conscious that someone else could be coming in to take over,\" he said. \"I've not been wanting to steal the limelight or take decisions which they should be taking.\" There had been suggestions that Pinder was reluctant to take on the role permanently his name had not cropped up on many observers' shortlists because of his insistence that he would only take the job for the interim period. Now he is finally able to look more than a few months ahead there are plenty of hard decisions which need to be taken, according to Forrester Research. In its paper, eGovernment fails the grade, it states bluntly that \"the UK government's aggressive e-commerce plans won't come to fruition.\" It says only the intervention of the private sector will allow the government to reach its goal of 100% electronic delivery of government services to businesses and consumers. Worse, it grades the efforts of a sample of departments from A to E, awarding an average of D. Departments hit with an E grade include the Department of Social Security, Office of National Statistics and Customs and Excise. Even the online efforts of the Office of the E-envoy got a lowly D rating, beaten by the the likes of the Inland Revenue (IR) and Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), which both scored the top mark awarded - a C. \"Plans for delivering services are wrong-headed,\" writes Forrester analyst Caroline Sceats. \"Only the IR and DCMS show any understanding of the pressures the government will face as a portal in the competitive internet environment.

His hero, Frank, is a gay playwright suffering a wasting illness, implicitly sexual, and haunted by guilt over some past action. That much is clear from Frank's very funny restaurant encounter with his coke-snorting doctor, who bemoans life's cruelty while avidly spotting celebrities. We then flash back in time to a get-together with Frank and his surrogate Balham family to learn the source of his shame. </p> <p>It would be cruel to reveal the plot's mainspring. What strikes me is the way Elyot, like Frank, observes bourgeois rituals with a mixture of mordant satire and outsiderish envy. Frank's best friend, Laura, is married to a dullish dentist and dotes obsessively on her 15-year-old son, Phillip. There is even something Proustian about the husband's loneliness in the face of such passion and about Frank's own feelings for Phillip. The ache of unsatisfied longing is, however, combined with acerbic comedy, not least in the savage portrait of Laura's brother-in-law, a philistine, wine dealer who is married to an intense, Beowulf-studying interior designer. </p> <p>In the end Elyot is dealing with the waywardness of passion: its ability to strike anywhere, any time between the most improbable couples. But he is also writing about the way it is filtered through memory and releases the artist's creativity. While he does this in a delicate, subtle, tightly written theatrical construct - only 90 minutes long - there are times when the play is too self-conscious for its own good. In particular, Frank's admission that he is constantly accused of dramatising his personal experience sounds suspiciously like a pre-emptive critical strike. </p> <p>In fact, this play shows Elyot's writing has an incremental power: it echoes earlier themes while taking him forward into bourgeois family life. It is also beautifully directed by Ian Rickson. </p> <p>If I had to highlight one moment it would be that in which Lindsay Duncan's sensually possessive Laura tangoes with Andrew McKay's Phillip: it is both quasi-incestuous and imbued with a larky gaiety. It also acquires extra poignancy as both Michael Maloney as the solitary Frank and Peter Wight as Laura's neglected husband gaze enviously on. </p> <p>All four actors are excellent, but the fascination of Elyot's accomplished play is that it shows the London suburbs to be every bit as much filled with pain, passion and guilt as Proust's Paris or Combray. </p> <p> Until March 10.

It has a cast of just over two dozen, its tawdry cloth Christmas tree manages to hoist itself up only inches in the transformation scene and there are no stage tricks. The dancers, through no fault of their own, look desperately over -exposed, especially since London has already seen the more lavishly funded Nutcrackers of the Royal and English National Ballet.</p> <p>There were two attractions, however: this is a production by ex-Bolshoi director Yuri Grigorovich (the version he first created for the Soviet company in 1966) and two of the Bolshoi's current stars, Elena Knaizkova and Nikolai Tsiskaridze, have been lent for the season. Generous gifts from the big guns but not, it turns out, entirely desirable.</p> <p>Even if you make generous allowances for a production pared down for touring, the staging looks parochial and heavy-handed. As in Grigorovich's other productions of the classics, the story has been squeezed to maximise opportunities for large-scale, athletic dancing. The Christmas party here is like a sparsely attended dance audition, the motivation for Drosselmeyer's magical machinations has been excised and there is no Sugar Plum Fairy to cast her benevolence over the last act.</p> <p>Grigorovich does supply some wittily eccentric moves for minor characters, but where the choreography needs to fly it is too often lumpen and lazy. Skippy choruses and heroic groupings impose themselves on music that cries for airy invention and the lovely grand pas de deux is thrown away. There is no emotional connection between the two principals, and the steps of the Fairy's variation are so wilfully at odds with the music that they are brutally hard to dance.</p> <p>Knaizkova (in the expanded role of Marie/Clara) certainly found them so. She may be a fine lyrical dancer elsewhere, but in the Nutcracker she is chafing at the logic of the choreography (and the peculiar speed of Svetlana Popova's conducting).</p> <p>Tsiskaridze, touted by some as the new Nureyev, is not so. He is tall and elegant, with an extravagantly arched line, but weaknesses in his torso and knees undermine his power. And the shy demurral of his stage presence is unsettlingly more reminiscent of Princess Di than of a ballet prince.</p> <p>Until February 17. Box office: 0870 606 3400.</p>",

Generous gifts from the big guns but not, it turns out, entirely desirable. Even if you make generous allowances for a production pared down for touring, the staging looks parochial and heavy-handed. As in Grigorovich's other productions of the classics, the story has been squeezed to maximise opportunities for large-scale, athletic dancing. The Christmas party here is like a sparsely attended dance audition, the motivation for Drosselmeyer's magical machinations has been excised and there is no Sugar Plum Fairy to cast her benevolence over the last act. Grigorovich does supply some wittily eccentric moves for minor characters, but where the choreography needs to fly it is too often lumpen and lazy. Skippy choruses and heroic groupings impose themselves on music that cries for airy invention and the lovely grand pas de deux is thrown away. There is no emotional connection between the two principals, and the steps of the Fairy's variation are so wilfully at odds with the music that they are brutally hard to dance. Knaizkova (in the expanded role of Marie/Clara) certainly found them so. She may be a fine lyrical dancer elsewhere, but in the Nutcracker she is chafing at the logic of the choreography (and the peculiar speed of Svetlana Popova's conducting). Tsiskaridze, touted by some as the new Nureyev, is not so. He is tall and elegant, with an extravagantly arched line, but weaknesses in his torso and knees undermine his power. And the shy demurral of his stage presence is unsettlingly more reminiscent of Princess Di than of a ballet prince. Until February 17. Box office: 0870 606 3400.",

      "bodyText": "David Beeves is a small-town Midas, a truly lucky man. When he wants to marry his childhood sweetheart, Hester, the only thing standing in his way is her father. But Dad conveniently gets run over, leaving his daughter a 110-acre farm. Then Beeves, a gifted mechanic, has the chance to further his career by fixing the car of a local bigwig. He works all night on the vehicle in vain, but as dawn breaks a stranger walks into the garage and immediately solves the problem. It is like being visited by a guardian angel.
