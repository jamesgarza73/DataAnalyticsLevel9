      "body": "<p>I notice Fifa fudged the issue of whether Pele or Maradona was player of the century by giving an award to both. For me Pele was the better of the two, although top of the lot in my book is Johan Cruyff. </p> <p>He was quick, lively and agile, and he not only scored great goals but made them. He orchestrated those fantastic Holland and Ajax sides in the way Alfredo di Stefano did with Real Madrid in the 50s and 60s. But as well as being the conductor, Cruyff was a real team man. </p> <p>I loved watching him. The \"Cruyff turn\" against Sweden in the 1974 World Cup was unforgettable, and I remember going to Villa Park to see him play for Barcelona in the 1977-78 Uefa Cup. I was manager of West Brom at the time and it was billed as the last time Cruyff would appear in England. Barca were winning 2-0 with a few minutes left and took Cruyff off so the crowd could pay their respects. The home supporters were clapping, cheering and stomping, but then went absolutely wild as Villa scored twice in the last minute to equalise. Barca won the return 2-1. </p> <p>Another Cruyff memory that stands out was seeing him in his latter years with Feyenoord. I was in Holland watching Jesper Olsen before signing him for Manchester United and Feyenoord hammered their bitter rivals Ajax. </p> <p>A great moment, though, was when Feyenoord had a free-kick about 30 yards out. Cruyff was lining up to take it when a big, precocious black guy came up and whacked the ball into the net. It was Ruud Gullit. We made a few enquiries about Gullit but were told he wouldn't leave Holland. </p> <p>For me there was something extra special about Cruyff, with his individual talent and team ethic, but Pele was hardly far behind. Nor, of course, was Maradona, but for me the Brazilian just gets the nod. </p> <p>Pele had more all round. He could do the unexpected but, if his side were up against it, which admittedly Brazil weren't very often, he could fit into a team pattern. He was a better collective player in terms of joining in with others, whereas Maradona was more a case of: we've got a problem, give me the ball and I'll sort it. </p> <p>Pele had everything: goals, spring, vision, skill, and a lot of people don't appreciate how powerful he was. One of his stock-in-trades on the ball was the way he held his arm out, almost rugby-fashion, to make it hard for defenders to get close. </p> <p>I can recall Pele coming to Sheffield and playing in a friendly at Hillsborough with Santos in 1962. He scored a memorable penalty past Ron Springett, doing a hop, skip and jump before stopping and coolly flipping the ball into the top of the net. </p> <p>Ten years later he was back there again. The kick-off was switched to the afternoon because of a power crisis and I'm told he sat in the dressing room for two hours afterwards signing autographs. The queue went from the dressing room, out of the ground and along the back of the stand to the main road. </p> <p>The shame was that the English public were robbed of seeing Pele's full majesty in 1966. I was at Everton when the Portuguese kicked him out of the World Cup, and the best we saw of him was in 1970. I watched on the telly and will never forget some of the things he pulled out: the dummy on the Uruguayan keeper, the long shot against the Czechs, the pass to Carlos Alberto. </p> <p>Pele was also involved in one of the funniest things I've seen. After Brazil reached the 1994 World Cup final I saw him in the VIP car park doing an interview. The Americans had put Alexei Lalas in with him discussing World Cup football and I was thinking: \"Hold on a bit, one of them knows everything and the other's a guitar-playing American.\" </p> <p>Having said that, I understand Pele could play guitar. Some of the lads who were involved in Escape to Victory with him said every night he would come down, open a bottle of Jack Daniels and sit with the boys and strum. </p> <p>As for Maradona, I admired not just his power, pace and supreme confidence but his bravery too. Hard as people tried, it was difficult to kick him out of a game. He played against my United team for Barcelona in Europe, although he was carrying an injury and made little or no contribution. </p> <p>The same doesn't go for the first time I saw him live. That was for Argentina against England at Wembley, when he had a phenomenal dribble, went past everybody and stroked it just wide. </p> <p>I had been introduced to him earlier in the day at a hotel in Kensington, where Alberto Tarantini, who had a spell at Birmingham City, told me: \"This is the best player you'll ever see.\" </p> <p>He was close, but my vote goes to Cruyff. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

It's a mood piece, deliberately paced and filmed with subtlety and discretion, and is a million miles away from a normal US teen movie and the standard look back at its 1970s setting - no flares, bongs or afros on show. </p> <p>Some of the decade's blander love songs (Carole King, Gilbert O'Sullivan) are, however, used as an ironic counterpart to the grisly subject matter - the suicide of a family's entire generation in a secure, affluent Michigan suburb. The film wants you to make up your own mind why, and fill in the gaps deliberately left by writer-director Sofia Coppola. The teenagers' parents (James Woods and Kathleen Turner) are not monsters, just a little strict. There's a key exchange early on: \"You're not old enough to know how bad life gets.\" \"You've obviously never been a teenage girl.\" </p> <p>Though a little anaemic in places, it is a confident debut by Coppola. This must be particularly sweet after her acting in Godfather III (an under-prepared sub for Winona Ryder) was met with such universal condemnation. The other key contribution here comes from cinematographer Edward Lachman. He gives the film a look as soft and dreamlike as his Erin Brockovich was tough and brutal. </p> <p><strong> Mission: Impossible 2</strong><br> Rental, retail (\u00a316.99) and DVD (\u00a319.99)<br> Paramount Cert 15 <br> *** <br> </p> <p>The \"should you choose to accept it...\" bit and the TV music theme survive from Mission: Impossible's small-scale origins, but otherwise this is pretty much a James Bond franchise by other means. To perk it up, Tom Cruise (a co-producer as well as the star) called up John Woo to put his trademark on it. So you have doves fluttering about indoors, lots of flames and the violence achieves that balletic-mythic dimension he's famous for, mainly in a stunning final fight. Of course, Hollywood was copying Woo's moves right through the 90s, so his style has lost a little freshness. </p> <p>Most of the stunts here look proficient rather than inspired and the liberal use of face masks only acts as a reminder that if you want a Woo film to mess with your mind as well as your eyeballs, you'd be better off giving his phenomenal Face/Off another look. That was pure Woo where this is a job for hire, but inspired moments remain - check the brilliant red in the flamenco scene where Cruise meets love interest Thandie Newton (the director says he based it on West Side Story) and the touch of amazing grace when villain Dougray Scott catches Newton's windblown scarf with split-second timing. </p> <p>Newton is a great improvement on the usual Bond bimbo. Her startling debut in Flirting co-starred one Nicole Kidman, so sometimes a producer's wife makes useful suggestions. Ving Rhames is the other survivor from M:I. There's a plot of sorts, about a man-made virus and its antidote but it's the look, the sheen and the love of hi-tech gadgets that stay with you.

Jack turns to his wife in private and hisses: \"Oh my God. Pam's middle name is Martha. That would make her... Pamela Martha Focker.\" </p> <p>So he's called Focker, and there's the Martha line. But that's it. With a movie that so obviously recalls Stiller's performance in There's Something About Mary you can't help but wonder how the Farrelly brothers would have developed the Focker gag. It wouldn't have been with much more ingenuity exactly, but surely with much more of the essential tactlessness and repetition that justifies its inclusion in the script in the first place. </p> <p>Either way, this reasonably amiable, watchable farce bears the same relationship to the Farrellys that Diet Coke does to the original. There is something low-sodium about it. As Dr Evil says to his son in Austin Powers 2, an earlier movie by Jay Roach: \"Just one calorie - not evil enough!\" It has the feeling, sometimes, of a TV pilot development of \"Mary\", in which the signature flourish of bad taste has been scaled down and the keynote of filth muted. </p> <p>When Greg nervously arrives at Jack's house, he immediately gets into his bad books for not liking cats. In every other respect a ruthless martinet, Jack is embarrassingly soppy about the family cat, disturbingly named Jinx, and he even calls it by singing a version of the chorus from What's New Pussycat?: \"Jinxie-cat, jinxie-cat, where are youuuu?\" It's a nice cringe-making touch from De Niro, which he crowns by revealing that he has trained Jinxie to urinate not in traditional kitty litter but in the toilet itself. It sounds promising. But our expectations, simultaneously heightened and depraved as they are by Farrelly animal-scenes, lead us inevitably to yearn for some major grossout from this cat. Although Jinxie is integral to the plot, the much hoped-for awe-inspiring moment of horror never really materialises. </p> <p>Ben Stiller gives us his distinctive prickly amour-propre in recognising yet resenting the foolish situations that he finds himself in: he can never totally be a good sport, and looks too much like a romantic lead to be an out-an-out clown. In this, he has something of Albert Brooks or Billy Crystal. But his comic presence has a disconcerting shrewdness and sourness sometimes, that was given full and appropriate expression in Stiller's performance in Black and White as the self-loathing crooked cop. </p> <p>As the grim father-in-law, Robert De Niro is again straining for the Second Act in his career as the Grand Old Man of light-ish comedy. With his habitual rat-trap mouth expression, he radiates a certain menace, and certainly everyone that comes within his forcefield looks intimidated - and that may, I suspect, reflect the effect the great man has on the rest of the cast anyway. The funniest turn comes from Owen Wilson as Pam's absurdly wealthy ex-boyfriend Kevin, who apart from being hogwhimperingly rich is a talented carpenter - inspired by a major role model: \"Who better than Christ?\" </p> <p>But his character, like everyone else in the film, is never quite allowed enough air to breathe.

It's a Hamlet in which you almost expect Nick Broomfield to wander into shot with his earphones and his microphone, saying: \"Um, Hamlet, if I could just - my production company wrote to you asking if we could - um, your Highness?

Ethan Hawke is the sweet Prince, with a goatee, a woolly hat and, confusingly sometimes, a chalkstripe suit with no tie - looking like someone keen to return to grad school at Wittenberg University (Dr Faustus's alma mater), but unsure whether to do philosophy or an MBA. </p> <p>He has returned home to find his father - the former CEO of the Denmark Corporation - dead and his mother Gertrude (Diane Venora) married to his smooth killer Claudius (Kyle MacLachlan), who has taken over the running of the firm.

      "bodyText": "After the stately Heritage Shoppe Hamlets from Kenneth Branagh and Mel Gibson, Michael Almereyda's new ultra-contemporary adaptation set in corporate New York City is a documentary Hamlet, a fly-on-the-wall Hamlet. It's a Hamlet in which you almost expect Nick Broomfield to wander into shot with his earphones and his microphone, saying: \"Um, Hamlet, if I could just - my production company wrote to you asking if we could - um, your Highness? If I could just - when you said 'a little more than kin and less than kind', do you mean that there's a compromise between the two...?\" Actually, Almereyda cuts that famous first line of Hamlet's, with all its sneering dumb insolence, cuts all of To Be Or Not To Be except for the first line which is repeated on a kind of video loop, loses Yorick's skull, and with it - perhaps thankfully - the opportunity for quite a bit of Marilyn Manson gothery.

      "bodyText": "The owner of a bizarre website dedicated to sheep has won a large out-of-court settlement from the British Airports Authority in the latest in a series of David and Goliath battles over domain names. BAA has paid Tom Bourke, owner of Baa.com, an undisclosed amount to avoid further legal wrangling. Mr Bourke could not comment on the case or the payment because of a confidentiality agreement. However BAA said it was the payment was the equivalent to what it would have paid out in litigation. Observers estimate this to be around \u00a3200,000. Mr Bourke's baa.com features a Dolly-cloned sheep puzzle game and other sheep-related news. BAA originally offered Mr Bourke \u00a38,000 for the name. He reportedly asked for \u00a32m. In April BAA announced it was serving a writ against him. Months of legal shenanigans have cost Mr Bourke over \u00a350,000. He ran a campaign against BAA on the site. BAA says it now owns the domain name and says it will use it as its global website. The news comes on the same day that film giant Warner Brothers dropped legal threats against a British schoolgirl's Harry Potter website. Last week Warner Brothers, owner of the film rights to author JK Rowling's blockbuster book, warned 15-year-old Claire Field after discovering she owned the domain name www.harrypotterguide.co.uk. It gave Ms Field 28 days to hand it over and offerd her a \u00a39.99 fee. But Warner Brothers head of publicity Barbara Broliatti saw sense and is now looking at granting Claire a free licence to become an official Harry Potter site.",

This subject - along with the question of the emperor's responsibility for wartime atrocities - was not covered at the 1946-48 Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal because the allies were seeking to rebuild Japan as an ally in the Cold War and few of the women were willing to come forward.

      "body": "<p>This was a week that definitely got better as it went on. Monday had been marked with a red spot on my year planner for some considerable time - and I don't use the red spots lightly. </p> <p>It was the night of the special council meeting at which the joint review was to be presented. We've been working on the action plan to address the findings for so long now it takes some effort of imagination to remember how it feels to hear the results for the first time. It was a sober occasion, which was appropriate to the judgment that Lambeth is not serving people well. </p> <p>The good news was that I was scheduled to follow the joint review presentation with one that would go through what we have done and are planning to do to address the problems. The bad news was that the PowerPoint technology failed at the start of the evening and I had to sit through the presentation - using back-up overhead slides - realising that my only back-ups were the hard copies of my presentation, which anyone with less than 20/20 vision in poor light would have great difficulty reading. In the end, the mayor summoned a replacement projector and I could continue in 21st century style.</p> <p>Once that was over it was straight into another council meeting that had been requisitioned to discuss the Barratt report and SSI inspection of children's services. I emerged at about 11pm feeling like a limp dishrag - but with a sense that the proverbial watershed had been reached. No more reports and inspections until September next year. There was a fabulous turnout of managers and a senior colleague from our health authority, who all agreed that there is a sense of optimism and a clear plan to take us forward.</p> <p>As part of the preparation for members I had put together a list of achievements over the last year. Heartening to see it stretched to three pages and included some pretty meaty stuff, so I took the time to go through it at the regular managers' meeting on Wednesday. This - coupled with presentations of bouquets to staff who had been nominated for commendation by clients - created a real feeling of positive energy. </p> <p>This carried me through what would otherwise have been a rather daunting \"star chamber\" meeting with the chief executive, leader, director of finance and what felt like hordes of others senior finance members and officers. It was a learning experience, not least because we are still getting to the bottom of the budgets and some old legacies. Once again, however, I was left with feelings of great corporate support backed up with tangible offers of resources to help crack the issues.</p> <p>On Thursday I visited our stand at Community Care Live and added my efforts to persuade people that Lambeth is the happening place in social services. We signed up 47 people who are interested in working for us, so we were obviously convincing.</p> <p>The week finished in the warm haze of the corporate management team's Christmas lunch, over which I shall draw a discreet veil.</p>",

Monday had been marked with a red spot on my year planner for some considerable time - and I don't use the red spots lightly. It was the night of the special council meeting at which the joint review was to be presented. We've been working on the action plan to address the findings for so long now it takes some effort of imagination to remember how it feels to hear the results for the first time. It was a sober occasion, which was appropriate to the judgment that Lambeth is not serving people well. The good news was that I was scheduled to follow the joint review presentation with one that would go through what we have done and are planning to do to address the problems. The bad news was that the PowerPoint technology failed at the start of the evening and I had to sit through the presentation - using back-up overhead slides - realising that my only back-ups were the hard copies of my presentation, which anyone with less than 20/20 vision in poor light would have great difficulty reading. In the end, the mayor summoned a replacement projector and I could continue in 21st century style. Once that was over it was straight into another council meeting that had been requisitioned to discuss the Barratt report and SSI inspection of children's services. I emerged at about 11pm feeling like a limp dishrag - but with a sense that the proverbial watershed had been reached. No more reports and inspections until September next year. There was a fabulous turnout of managers and a senior colleague from our health authority, who all agreed that there is a sense of optimism and a clear plan to take us forward. As part of the preparation for members I had put together a list of achievements over the last year. Heartening to see it stretched to three pages and included some pretty meaty stuff, so I took the time to go through it at the regular managers' meeting on Wednesday. This - coupled with presentations of bouquets to staff who had been nominated for commendation by clients - created a real feeling of positive energy. This carried me through what would otherwise have been a rather daunting \"star chamber\" meeting with the chief executive, leader, director of finance and what felt like hordes of others senior finance members and officers. It was a learning experience, not least because we are still getting to the bottom of the budgets and some old legacies. Once again, however, I was left with feelings of great corporate support backed up with tangible offers of resources to help crack the issues. On Thursday I visited our stand at Community Care Live and added my efforts to persuade people that Lambeth is the happening place in social services. We signed up 47 people who are interested in working for us, so we were obviously convincing. The week finished in the warm haze of the corporate management team's Christmas lunch, over which I shall draw a discreet veil.",

After four years, editor Rod Liddle wants to bring the vote back but has banned politicians from the nominations. The BBC axed the award in 1996 after suspect nominations were received on behalf of a number of politicians. On one occasion \"a couple of dozen\" letters in the same handwriting were received to nominate Teresa Gorman, Conservative MP for Billericay. But according to a BBC News spokesman, \"they were all at it\". And some politicial administrators had sent chain emails that included automated nominations from their friends and colleagues. \"I've decided to bar politicians because there is a real danger they or their supporters will try to rig the vote,\" said Mr Liddle. It will be rebranded \"Hero and Villain of the Year\", with listeners also voting for their least favourite public figure. A shortlist will be drawn up from December 18, with essayists giving their opinions on why certain \"heroes\" and \"villains\" should be nominated. Chris Woodhead, Matthew Pinsent, Susan Greenfield and Sir Bob Ayling will be the first to air their views on the nominations.

The new children's commissioner for Wales, Peter Clarke, will break new ground by appointing children in a key advisory role. His appointment itself was pioneering, with a dozen children drawn from across Wales playing a part by interviewing the six shortlisted candidates on the day prior to the formal interviews. As Mr Clarke, currently director of Childline Cymru, gets used to his appointment, it's emerged that he is to have additional responsibilities. The existing powers, largely centring on children in care, are to be expanded in a new parliamentary bill announced in the Queen's Speech on December 6. The bill is expected to extend the commissioner's brief to cover children in NHS hospitals and schools in Wales. The commissioner's brief takes in domiciliary services for children with disabilities, the social care elements of day care services for children under eight, and adoption agencies and services. It also covers children's homes, services for children in private and voluntary hospitals and clinics, residential family centres and welfare inspections of boarding schools. \"The bill is expected to expand the commissioner's role by applying the commissioner's powers to review and monitor arrangements for complaints, whistleblowing and advocacy on behalf of children to a wider range of bodies, including schools and NHS hospitals which provide services for children in Wales,\" said a spokesperson for the Wales Office. A national assembly spokesperson said that the brief would apply to hospitals in Wales: \"Jurisdiction under the bill will not extend to the services themselves if they are provided outside Wales. However, the commissioner will be able to look at and comment on the action of public bodies in Wales in arranging such services provided outside Wales.\" The commissioner is also likely to be given powers to review the operations of the Welsh national assembly and other public agencies where they involve children. With the appointment, the principality becomes the first part of the UK to have a children's commissioner. A commissioner was one of the main recommendations of the Waterhouse tribunal into abuse in children's home in north Wales. Clarke is expected to take up his \u00a370,000-a-year appointment some time in the new year with a budget in the first year of around \u00a3700,000. Clarke says children will be closely involved in the operation of the office, and that he planned to have an advisory group of children. \"One of my first tasks will be to set up procedures for advocacy and complaints, and I will draw on the experience of children to form an advisory group of young people. I want Wales to be a child-centred country,\" he said. The post of Welsh children's commissioner is for a fixed seven-year term without the possibility of re-appointment, an arrangement designed to bolster the commissioner's independence from the National Assembly for Wales. \"He will be an independent officer who will report to the assembly but who will work like an ombudsman,\" said assembly first minister Rhodri Morgan. Assembly health minster Jane Hutt said: \"Wales is taking the lead in the UK in placing the rights and needs of our children and young people centre stage. The appointment itself was an innovative process that took into account the views of children and young people.\" There are as yet no plans for commissioners in other regions of the UK, although the NSPCC and a number of other agencies have been campaigning for them. A number of other countries already have their own children's commissioners. New Zealand made one of the first appointments in 1989, while some Scandinavian countries and British Columbia in Canada also have commissioners.",

But we're not the only ones, because Aston Villa chairman Doug Ellis doesn't like it either. Only he hates it even more than we do! And today he gave us another masterclass in his dark arts. The day started well for Ellis - and badly for John Gregory - when Villa's \"skinflint board.\" (\u00a9 the Daily Star) told their manager to jettison planned big-money moves for Benni McCarthy and Juan Pablo Angel. \"If you can't buy a BMW then you go for a Rover,\" admitted a weary John Gregory, as he watched Sunderland reject Milton Nunez trudge his way around the training ground. </p> <p>But at lunchtime worse things got even better for Ellis when David James rejected a new contract offer, and instead demanded a transfer - citing, like Gareth Southgate before him, Villa's (i.e. Ellis's) lack of ambition. James then disappeared into hiding, but seeing as he said last week: \"I was one of those in the summer who was worried about which way the club were goingI need to be satisfied that the club harbour the same ambitions as myself,\" it seems Ellis's penny-pinching ways have got to him too.</p> <p>By 2pm Ellis had offended his manager and his second England international of the season. So who else was there to pick on? Why, the fans of course. When we logged onto the Aston Villa website (avfc.co.uk) this afternoon we found that the link to Ellis's Christmas message sent us, appropriately enough, to a blank screen. Fortunately, the link to \"The Perfect Christmas Present for Villa Fans\" -an executive \u00a395-a-head package to see Villa v Leicester, featuring \"a welcome pack and drink, a \"pay bar facility\" and a \"warm welcome by a senior official\" still works.

And that's a darn sight more than West Ham or Chelsea's of Chelsea look like doing.</p> <p>Keane became the latest target of Claudio Ranieri's \"Buy young and British\" policy (not strictly accurate in this case Claudio, there's a bit of history involved) when the Blues had a \u00a312m bid for the 20-year-old accepted by Internazionale. \"We have had discussions with Inter Milan about Robbie Keane\", said Colin Hutchinson with all the enthusiasm of a neutered pitbull. Because no matter how much cash the fashionable West London boutique is willing to splash, the striker is not prepared to leave the San Siro for anyone. Apart from David O'Leary, of course. </p> <p>Well that's what Appy Arry Redknapp would have you believe. The Upton Park 'ead 'oncho failed in a typically cheeky attempt to sign Keane earlier this week, and he believes that the only club Baby Irish will sign for is Leeds. \"They accepted our offer,\" said Arry, \"and the lad's wages would not have been a problem because he isn't on silly money over there.

      "byline": "Sally Weale",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When Samira Makhmalbaf was a little girl growing up in Tehran, she lived in a house filled with talk of cinema. She remembers earwigging as her mother and father, the celebrated Iranian film-maker Mohsen Makhmalbaf, discussed movies from dawn till dusk; she went with him on location, she watched him editing, she starred in his films. The world of film and film-making filled her every waking hour and excited every sense. Little wonder, then, that the daughter of this father is now making her own films. And to great international acclaim. </p> <p>Makhmalbaf is as striking as her films. Tiny and dark, she is intense, urgent, ferocious. Her kohl-rimmed eyes are penetrating, her small hands agile and expressive. She wants you to understand her work; she harangues and charms you, her husky little voice - like a teenage boy's - getting higher and higher as she battles with her English. </p> <p>Makhmalbaf is in London to promote her new film, Blackboards (Takhte Siah), which is by general agreement an extraordinary achievement by an extraordinary young film director. It is only her second, but it has already confirmed her as a mini film genius of staggering maturity. She's still only 20, a young woman with a girlish laugh who likes skating, swimming and cycling. </p> <p>She has again teamed up with her father, who co-scripted and edited Blackboards, as he did with her first film, The Apple. There have inevitably been dark whispers about how far they are her own work and how much her father's. Makhmalbaf doesn't care. She is wonderfully defiant: \"I want him to edit my films so why should I have to, because he is my father, say, 'No, please don't edit it'?\" She does not know if she will work with him again. \"Being young, yeah, you want to be independent. But at the same time, I'm not that much young. At the moment I'm so old. Even older than what he is. He is 40 and something, and I am 90 years old.\" </p> <p>Blackboards is the sort of film that takes your breath away and leaves its images burned indelibly on your mind. The story opens with a group of teachers roving the mountains between Iraq and Iran, in a landscape of breathtaking beauty and danger, their blackboards on their backs, in search of students. The original idea, Makhmalbaf says, was her father's, conceived while they were travelling together in Kurdistan. The development was all her own. </p> <p>The film follows two of the teachers who break away from the group - one, Reeboir, comes across a trail of boys, who like him are carrying their livelihoods on their shoulders. These children are \"mules\", smuggling contraband over the border. He offers to teach them in return for bread. The second teacher, Said, joins up with a group of Kurdish refugees made up of old men, one woman and a young child, who are making their way back to their homeland of Iraq to die. They refuse his offer to teach them, but they pay him in walnuts to guide them to the border. </p> <p>Some of the scenes, so tender and strange, are unforgettable: two old men trying to encourage their friend to urinate - he hasn't passed water for two days and is in agony; a mother trying to get her little boy to do the same, gently splashing him with water as she croons encouragement; an old man with his face covered, tossing hay seemingly aimlessly into the air, who has a letter he cannot read. It is from his son, a prisoner of war in Iraq. </p> <p>Makhmalbaf spent four months shooting the film in the Kurdish mountains near Halabcheh, a city on the Iraqi border where the Iraqis gassed the Kurds during the Iran-Iraq war. She dodged landmines daily and used a cast of 200 local villagers, with just two professional actors taking leading roles. \"It was one of the best experiences I had, living with those people,\" she says. \"Because I loved them. They were humans, good humans, suffering from different things. It was a deeper kind of life compared to most of the other places I've lived.\" </p> <p>The film works through allegory, metaphor and the surreal, rather than documentary - and explores what happens to people caught up in conflicts. Violence is never far away: the film echoes with the sound of gunfire and helicopters. At one point, near the border, the Kurdish refugees throw themselves to the ground believing themselves to be under chemical attack. The camera, held at shoulder level, meanders among these stoical people trekking through the mountains, giving the viewer a refugee's-eye view of this beautiful but frightening world. </p> <p>On a chilly day in London, Makhmalbaf is wrapped up in black, heavy cotton, like a precious object. When she has met other interviewers she has worn jeans; today she is wearing more traditional dress, which would not look out of place on the streets of Tehran. Maybe it's because she's about to catch a plane home. I think she's had enough of media interviews, being quizzed about politics and Islam. Lots of western journalists expect her to be much more angry and openly critical of the political situation in Iran. </p> <p>She says she's more interested in deeper, greater, universal truths, rather than the specifics of a particular political system. Which is clearly true - she is an artist rather than a political activist - but there must be an element of self-preservation in her reticence. Iran is her home, she loves it, and she has to live and work there, in the shadow of the censors, who - remarkably - have left her films untouched. </p> <p>And of course there are her father's experiences to take into account. As a young man, Mohsen Makhmalbaf was an Islamic revolutionary opposed to the Shah's regime. When he was 17, he was arrested after he stabbed a policeman with a knife. He was saved from the firing squad because of his youth; his prison sentence was cut short when he was freed as a result of the 1979 revolution, and on his release he became a propagandist film-maker for Ayatollah Khomeini. Later, he started to read the philosophers and moved away from dogma to a poetic cinematic vision. (Her mother apparently burned to death in a house fire and her father subsequently married his late wife's sister.) </p> <p>Earlier this year Makhmalbaf cast aside her usual reticence to make a rare political statement in public, dedicating a prize she picked up at Cannes for Blackboards to the \"heroic efforts\" of the pro-democracy moment in Iran. I ask her how the movement is progressing - there have been serious setbacks since the landslide victory of the reforming President Mohammad Khatami three years ago with liberal newspapers shut down and hundreds of reformers jailed - but she is reluctant to elaborate. \"It is starting. Something has started. It is better than not to have started. It might have some ups and downs, but I'm optimistic.\" </p> <p>She pauses, then turns her laser-like attention on her interpreter for an intense little discussion before turning it back on me. \"I imagine no politicians from Iran come here. No? They never have any interviews with you, so when we come here, you think we are politicians. No, I'm not a politician. If I was born somewhere else, I wouldn't be talking this much about politics. I could use the language of art. </p> <p>\"Even if I made that kind of direct movie talking about politics, it's nothing. Nothing, because it's just talking like a journalist. You are saying something superficial. The movies I make are deeper. This kind of work can live more, longer, deeper, compared to that kind of journalistic work.\" There is no hint of arrogance in what she says. She is one of those people fired by a natural, instinctive self-belief, the sort of self-belief that enabled her to walk out of school at the age of 15 because she felt her teachers were not teaching her anything new. She asked her father to tell her about film-making and, three years later, she made The Apple - becoming the youngest director in the world to compete in the official section of the 1998 Cannes film festival. </p> <p> The Apple is another film that leaves you shellshocked. It is the true story of a man, married to a blind woman, who keeps his twin 12-year-old daughters locked up behind bars at home. The characters all \"play\" themselves, and the film records the girls' first steps into the world beyond the bars of their home and their magical awakening to the wonders of ordinary life. The Apple tells us about life for women in Iran today but its power is in its humanity, rather than in exposure - the father is not vilified for what he has done, the film struggles instead to explain his actions.

      "bodyText": "When Samira Makhmalbaf was a little girl growing up in Tehran, she lived in a house filled with talk of cinema. She remembers earwigging as her mother and father, the celebrated Iranian film-maker Mohsen Makhmalbaf, discussed movies from dawn till dusk; she went with him on location, she watched him editing, she starred in his films. The world of film and film-making filled her every waking hour and excited every sense. Little wonder, then, that the daughter of this father is now making her own films. And to great international acclaim. Makhmalbaf is as striking as her films. Tiny and dark, she is intense, urgent, ferocious. Her kohl-rimmed eyes are penetrating, her small hands agile and expressive. She wants you to understand her work; she harangues and charms you, her husky little voice - like a teenage boy's - getting higher and higher as she battles with her English. Makhmalbaf is in London to promote her new film, Blackboards (Takhte Siah), which is by general agreement an extraordinary achievement by an extraordinary young film director. It is only her second, but it has already confirmed her as a mini film genius of staggering maturity. She's still only 20, a young woman with a girlish laugh who likes skating, swimming and cycling. She has again teamed up with her father, who co-scripted and edited Blackboards, as he did with her first film, The Apple. There have inevitably been dark whispers about how far they are her own work and how much her father's. Makhmalbaf doesn't care. She is wonderfully defiant: \"I want him to edit my films so why should I have to, because he is my father, say, 'No, please don't edit it'?\" She does not know if she will work with him again. \"Being young, yeah, you want to be independent. But at the same time, I'm not that much young. At the moment I'm so old. Even older than what he is. He is 40 and something, and I am 90 years old.\" Blackboards is the sort of film that takes your breath away and leaves its images burned indelibly on your mind. The story opens with a group of teachers roving the mountains between Iraq and Iran, in a landscape of breathtaking beauty and danger, their blackboards on their backs, in search of students. The original idea, Makhmalbaf says, was her father's, conceived while they were travelling together in Kurdistan. The development was all her own. The film follows two of the teachers who break away from the group - one, Reeboir, comes across a trail of boys, who like him are carrying their livelihoods on their shoulders. These children are \"mules\", smuggling contraband over the border. He offers to teach them in return for bread. The second teacher, Said, joins up with a group of Kurdish refugees made up of old men, one woman and a young child, who are making their way back to their homeland of Iraq to die. They refuse his offer to teach them, but they pay him in walnuts to guide them to the border. Some of the scenes, so tender and strange, are unforgettable: two old men trying to encourage their friend to urinate - he hasn't passed water for two days and is in agony; a mother trying to get her little boy to do the same, gently splashing him with water as she croons encouragement; an old man with his face covered, tossing hay seemingly aimlessly into the air, who has a letter he cannot read. It is from his son, a prisoner of war in Iraq. Makhmalbaf spent four months shooting the film in the Kurdish mountains near Halabcheh, a city on the Iraqi border where the Iraqis gassed the Kurds during the Iran-Iraq war. She dodged landmines daily and used a cast of 200 local villagers, with just two professional actors taking leading roles. \"It was one of the best experiences I had, living with those people,\" she says. \"Because I loved them. They were humans, good humans, suffering from different things. It was a deeper kind of life compared to most of the other places I've lived.\" The film works through allegory, metaphor and the surreal, rather than documentary - and explores what happens to people caught up in conflicts. Violence is never far away: the film echoes with the sound of gunfire and helicopters. At one point, near the border, the Kurdish refugees throw themselves to the ground believing themselves to be under chemical attack. The camera, held at shoulder level, meanders among these stoical people trekking through the mountains, giving the viewer a refugee's-eye view of this beautiful but frightening world. On a chilly day in London, Makhmalbaf is wrapped up in black, heavy cotton, like a precious object. When she has met other interviewers she has worn jeans; today she is wearing more traditional dress, which would not look out of place on the streets of Tehran. Maybe it's because she's about to catch a plane home. I think she's had enough of media interviews, being quizzed about politics and Islam. Lots of western journalists expect her to be much more angry and openly critical of the political situation in Iran. She says she's more interested in deeper, greater, universal truths, rather than the specifics of a particular political system. Which is clearly true - she is an artist rather than a political activist - but there must be an element of self-preservation in her reticence. Iran is her home, she loves it, and she has to live and work there, in the shadow of the censors, who - remarkably - have left her films untouched. And of course there are her father's experiences to take into account. As a young man, Mohsen Makhmalbaf was an Islamic revolutionary opposed to the Shah's regime. When he was 17, he was arrested after he stabbed a policeman with a knife. He was saved from the firing squad because of his youth; his prison sentence was cut short when he was freed as a result of the 1979 revolution, and on his release he became a propagandist film-maker for Ayatollah Khomeini. Later, he started to read the philosophers and moved away from dogma to a poetic cinematic vision. (Her mother apparently burned to death in a house fire and her father subsequently married his late wife's sister.) Earlier this year Makhmalbaf cast aside her usual reticence to make a rare political statement in public, dedicating a prize she picked up at Cannes for Blackboards to the \"heroic efforts\" of the pro-democracy moment in Iran. I ask her how the movement is progressing - there have been serious setbacks since the landslide victory of the reforming President Mohammad Khatami three years ago with liberal newspapers shut down and hundreds of reformers jailed - but she is reluctant to elaborate. \"It is starting. Something has started. It is better than not to have started. It might have some ups and downs, but I'm optimistic.\" She pauses, then turns her laser-like attention on her interpreter for an intense little discussion before turning it back on me. \"I imagine no politicians from Iran come here. No? They never have any interviews with you, so when we come here, you think we are politicians. No, I'm not a politician. If I was born somewhere else, I wouldn't be talking this much about politics. I could use the language of art. \"Even if I made that kind of direct movie talking about politics, it's nothing. Nothing, because it's just talking like a journalist. You are saying something superficial. The movies I make are deeper. This kind of work can live more, longer, deeper, compared to that kind of journalistic work.\" There is no hint of arrogance in what she says. She is one of those people fired by a natural, instinctive self-belief, the sort of self-belief that enabled her to walk out of school at the age of 15 because she felt her teachers were not teaching her anything new. She asked her father to tell her about film-making and, three years later, she made The Apple - becoming the youngest director in the world to compete in the official section of the 1998 Cannes film festival. The Apple is another film that leaves you shellshocked. It is the true story of a man, married to a blind woman, who keeps his twin 12-year-old daughters locked up behind bars at home. The characters all \"play\" themselves, and the film records the girls' first steps into the world beyond the bars of their home and their magical awakening to the wonders of ordinary life. The Apple tells us about life for women in Iran today but its power is in its humanity, rather than in exposure - the father is not vilified for what he has done, the film struggles instead to explain his actions. He is simply doing his best, however misguided, to protect his daughters according to the teachings of the Koran. Makhmalbaf kept in touch with the daughters. After their mother died, their father was persuaded to let another family look after them because he could not accept their freedom. They receive a monthly allowance from the profits of the film and are now studying at school. I ask about life for women in Iran. \"We have a lot of limitations,\" she says. \"From all the written and unwritten law. But, still, I hope and I believe that it will get better. It has started with the democracy movement. But some things don't happen consciously. I wanted to make films, I made films to say something else, but in a way I became a kind of example.

Yes, we have a lot of limitations, but these limitations made a lot of strong, different kinds of women in Iran who, if they find a chance to express themselves, I'm sure have plenty of things to say. They may have found a deeper way through all these limitations.\" But what makes her most angry about the restrictions imposed on women? \"This kind of narrow-mindedness which is in the schools or in the mind of the people. They think you are not a first class human being, you are second class. And you might have a kind of limitation in your mind because you are a woman.

She's not saying any more. \"You have to keep it a secret in your heart, in your mind,\" she says, \"and not talk about it at all with anybody - so that it comes to a kind of maturity. Then it's the time.\" Take your time, Samira. If the first two are anything to go by, the third will be well worth the wait. \u0095 Blackboards is released on December 29.",

      "bodyText": "BT has raised the stakes in its confrontation with French media giant Vivendi Universal by unveiling a rival web service. Today it launched a multiple-access portal called POP as a counter-punch to Vizzavi, the mobile internet service co-owned by Vivendi Universal and UK mobile phone giant Vodafone. \"It will be a competing portal to Vizzavi. The market is in its early stages, but we welcome the competition,\" said a BT spokesman. BT is seeking compensation from Vivendi Universal, claiming that the Vizzavi service breaks a shareholder pact between the companies. They are partners in French telecoms operator Cegetel, and BT is furious that Vivendi Universal has signed up the mobile phone arm to the Vizzavi portal. BT refused to comment on its legal action, but Vodafone boss Chris Gent has poured scorn on the company's actions, accusing it of overreacting. Vizzavi has kept a low profile since it was unveiled to great fanfare in the summer, but it has a potential customer base of 80m across Europe, and there are plans for a global launch. The POP portal, which will be available on the BTopenworld service, is aiming for an identical customer base of Wap and PalmPilot users. Vivendi Universal was formed by the \u00a350bn merger of the French company and Seagram of Canada, owner of Universal Film and Universal Music. The new company's extensive content, which includes programmes from the Canal Plus pay-TV channel, is one of the key selling points for the Vizzavi service. Meanwhile, BT is to launch a new, unmetered access service as the cornerstone of its internet strategy. The service, to be called BTinternet Anytime, will offer 24-hour access for \u00a314.99 per month to existing customers. Latest figures also revealed BT as the UK's largest unmetered internet service provider, with over 500,000 customers.",

      "bodyText": "BBC Breakfast editor Andrew Thompson is quitting the programme to join Peter Salmon in the BBC's sports department. Mr Thompson, who was responsible for the rebranding of Jeremy Bowen from flak-jacketed hero to laid-back morning host, will be working with Mr Salmon on new projects. Mr Thompson said: \"I'm looking forward to taking a lead with Peter Salmon in driving forward new opportunities for BBC sport.\" But he added that it was too early to talk about specific plans. As head of special projects and development, Mr Thompson will work across BBC1, BBC2 and the new digital channels, focusing on interactive programmes. Mr Salmon, the former controller of BBC1, was put in charge of the BBC's sporting output in September. He was also given a seat on the BBC's board of executive directors in a bid to give sports a higher profile. The repositioning of sport within the BBC is part of a concerted effort by director general Greg Dyke to boost the ailing sports department. BBC Sport has suffered years of crushing defeats including the loss this year of premiership football highlights, Formula One, Test cricket, the Ryder Cup and the Derby. But recently Mr Dyke has renewed his attempts to boost the corporation's rights portfolio. Mr Salmon is planning to launch a digital sporting channel, and the BBC is working on an exclusive rights package with boxer Audley Harrison that could pave the way for a new wave of managing rights for sporting heroes. Mr Thompson was responsible for the relaunch of Breakfast News in October and was the man who persuaded Jeremy Bowen to end his career as a war correspondent and tries his hand at TV anchoring. However, Mr Bowen has not been an outright hit despite his widely regarded experience as a foreign reporter. Last week he came under fire from broadcaster Sir Ludovic Kennedy, who said he was \"so laid back he might be in a coffin\". But Mr Thompson said the remarks had nothing to do with his decision to leave the breakfast job. \"Jeremy's a good presenter,\" he said.",

The next thing I knew I was in a strange house with total strangers,\" said Rah, aged 13. </p> <p>Rah, who lives with his ill mother and younger brother, went to stay with a succession of neighbours and friends when his mother went in and out of hospital because of a long-standing illness. \"I never saw the social workers. I lost trust in them and felt alone,\" he said. </p> <p>Lucie, 15, lives with her mother who has a bad back and has battled against cancer on three separate occasions. Her father often has to work away from home. \"When my dad is away I have to look after my mum and younger brother. I have to cook, clean the house and help my mum. I have to fetch my mum's pills and help her to get out of bed. It's hard work and sometimes I feel really tired. This is made worse because I have to go out to work to earn my pocket money.\" Lucie also reported problems with social workers. \"When my dad is away I become responsible for everybody and the house. I don't get on with social workers because they keep trying to take me and my brother away from my mum when my dad is working,\" she said. </p> <p>Rah and Lucie are \"young carers\" - children who carry out, often on a regular basis, significant caring tasks and assume a level of responsibility which would usually be associated with an adult. There are an estimated 50,000 children like Rah and Lucie in Britain today. Theirs are just two of the accounts in the first ever collection of writings from young carers, published by the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation.</p> <p>The youngest contributor is nine, the oldest 18. The children's own words reveal a secretive and hidden world, where children and parents are often frightened of what social workers, doctors, teachers and other professionals might do, and yet at the same time families would benefit from the help and support that could be provided by these professionals. It's a world where children are involved in a wide range of caring tasks and family responsibilities, but their contribution is usually overlooked - even ignored - by many professionals.</p> <p>Many of the children are looking after a mother, often in single-parent families. But even in two-parent families children often have to provide care. Ten-year-old Michelle, for example, looks after her mother, who has epilepsy, because there is no other adult in the family to do it. Lucylee, 13, has to care for her mother who suffers from manic depression and a curved spine. Her stepfather is a police officer \"and works long shifts which can be hard for us when mum is really ill\". While she enjoys helping her mum she only wishes that, it could be a bit easier\".</p> <p>Some of the children, such as 10-year-old Jasmine, show maturity beyond their years. Jasmine's mother is often in and out of hospital. On the last occasion Jasmine found her mother smoking in the garden. \"I was so upset. When I was telling her off I sounded like the mother. I was saying things like, 'Get back to bed. Do you want to kill yourself smoking? Give me your cigarette or put it out.'\"</p> <p>Some of the children's accounts make harrowing reading, especially where parents have a mental illness or misuse alcohol or drugs. Then there are those children who are crying out for attention, like Katie, 12, who says in an open letter to her mother: \"I wish that you and me could spend some more time together sometimes. I feel really sad and left out. You make me feel like a pair of hands, just there to help, instead of a daughter ... please spend some time with me.\"</p> <p>Many of the young carers are critical of social workers, teachers and health care workers, who are seen as unhelpful, or at worst ignorant or punitive. Clearly, these professionals, but especially social workers - who play such a pivotal role in gate-keeping access to family services - need to become more aware and sensitive to the needs of young carers and their families.</p> <p>Professionals need to look for signs that children might be acting as carers. Social workers and social care staff, for example, need to:</p> <p>\u0095 Find out whether parents with disabilities or long-term illness are receiving any support, assistance or care in the home from other family members, and if so who provides this support, what it is that they do, and why they do it. </p> <p>\u0095 Check if children have health or social problems, such as a strained back, or emotional, behavioural or educational difficulties, and whether this might be linked in any way with having to care for another family member or from having to take on other responsibilities normally associated with an adult.</p> <p>\u0095 Assess what help and support children and parents need in order to prevent children from having to continue to provide care or to reduce their responsibilities, and what help parents need with personal care and with parenting.</p> <p>Young carers and ill or disabled parents have the right to an assessment of their needs by social services, but many don't know about their rights or may be frightened to seek help. Breaking that cycle of ignorance and fear is important. The emphasis in assessment and service delivery must be on preventing children from taking on inappropriate caring responsibilities in the first place, and stopping these roles from becoming firmly established once started. To do this, professionals must acknowledge and recognise the contributions made by young carers and their ill or disabled parents, and assesses the needs of all family members. </p> <p>Young carers will welcome such developments.

The correspondence, about oral sex, \"beggars belief\", he wrote, forwarding it to a dozen more people with the comment: \"I feel honour bound to circulate this.\"</p> <p>Another responded: \"What a top lass! Let's start a campaign to find her.\"</p> <p>The hunt expanded swiftly. The message was estimated by internet experts to have passed through the inboxes of a million readers, via City firms and such institutions as the Guardian, the BBC and the Science Museum.</p> <p>Mr Chait's law firm Norton Rose reportedly had \"no recollection\" of her, and internet searches proved fruitless. One promising lead proved fruitless as the Optician X company added a press release to its website, above a photo of its customer relations manager Claire Swire, stating: \"Sorry Folks, this is not the Claire Swire you are searching for.\" </p> <p>The Daily Mail finally tracked Ms Swire down to her parents' home in Uckbridge, East Sussex. The young woman, dark-haired and wearing glasses, refused to comment on her new-found fame.</p> <p>Online newspaper the Register printed two - probably spoof - responses from a purported Claire Swire, saying she did indeed exist, was an ex-Norton Rose employee and \"was not ashamed\". </p> <p>\"I can't believe this,\" one message ran. \"First of all, I don't know any of you!! What do you care about my social life? Don't you sad bastards have anything better to do with your time?\" </p> <p>The Register initially speculated that the whole exchange was a hoax - a view given some credence when Mr Chait told the paper: \"It's a hoax. A very good one though, I have to admit.\" </p> <p>However, Norton Rose is taking the incident seriously. The company claims to have \"a robust approach to email abuse\", and Mr Chait and several other staff at the firm are reportedly facing disciplinary action over the forwarding of the email. It appears he has learnt the hard way that in some circumstances it is important to keep your mouth shut.</p> <p><strong>Related stories</strong><br> <a href=\" http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,3930930,00.html\">November 16 1999: Rash of hoax emails </a><br> <a href=\" http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4049766,00.html\">August 10 2000: How information spreads across the internet</a> <br> <a href=\" http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/more_about/0,5167,246609,00.html\">I kiss you: the Mahir phenomonon</a></p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br> <a href=\" http://www.theregister.co.uk/\">The Register</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/28/15415.html\">Claire Swire's purported responses on the Register</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/15404.html\">The Register: is this the greatest ever email hoax?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.opticianx.com/contact.asp\">Optician X</a></p>",

The correspondence, about oral sex, \"beggars belief\", he wrote, forwarding it to a dozen more people with the comment: \"I feel honour bound to circulate this.\" Another responded: \"What a top lass! Let's start a campaign to find her.\" The hunt expanded swiftly. The message was estimated by internet experts to have passed through the inboxes of a million readers, via City firms and such institutions as the Guardian, the BBC and the Science Museum. Mr Chait's law firm Norton Rose reportedly had \"no recollection\" of her, and internet searches proved fruitless. One promising lead proved fruitless as the Optician X company added a press release to its website, above a photo of its customer relations manager Claire Swire, stating: \"Sorry Folks, this is not the Claire Swire you are searching for.\" The Daily Mail finally tracked Ms Swire down to her parents' home in Uckbridge, East Sussex. The young woman, dark-haired and wearing glasses, refused to comment on her new-found fame. Online newspaper the Register printed two - probably spoof - responses from a purported Claire Swire, saying she did indeed exist, was an ex-Norton Rose employee and \"was not ashamed\". \"I can't believe this,\" one message ran. \"First of all, I don't know any of you!! What do you care about my social life? Don't you sad bastards have anything better to do with your time?\" The Register initially speculated that the whole exchange was a hoax - a view given some credence when Mr Chait told the paper: \"It's a hoax. A very good one though, I have to admit.\" However, Norton Rose is taking the incident seriously. The company claims to have \"a robust approach to email abuse\", and Mr Chait and several other staff at the firm are reportedly facing disciplinary action over the forwarding of the email. It appears he has learnt the hard way that in some circumstances it is important to keep your mouth shut.

These are among the recommendations in a report to Lord Sainsbury, Minister for Science, on the future role of the Engineering Council - the lead registration and regulatory body for the profession.

Leonard Gorodkin said at the inquest on the baby in Manchester that he was discarding all the usual verdicts listed in the coroner's rules. He recorded simply: \"Mary died following surgery separating her from her conjoined twin, which surgery was permitted by an order of the High Court, confirmed by the Court of Appeal.\" Mr Gorodkin said that he would not record any of the usual verdicts of accident, misadventure, unlawful or lawful killing or an open verdict. He made his ruling after hearing evidence during the two-hour inquest that Mary had had no chance of survival following the operation to separate her from her stronger sister Jodie at St Mary's Hospital in Manchester on November 6. The coroner said that the case had been unique to the Court of Appeal. He said: \"It is as unique for me as a coroner as it was for the judges. I don't believe any coroner has had to consider a death from surgery when it was known beforehand the patient was going to die. \"All surgery carries with it a mortality rate but in the case of Mary that was a one hundred percent rate.\" He said a verdict of lawful killing was one which might have been considered. But he added: \"The purpose and the reason for separation was not to kill Mary even though her death arose from it.\" He said that clearly an unlawful killing verdict was not applicable \"although some people emotionally believe that Mary was murdered, of course that isn't the case\". The twins were born at St Mary's on August 8. There followed a long legal battle after their parents Michaelangelo Attard, 44, and his wife Rina, 29, strict Roman Catholics from the island of Gozo, off Malta, opposed the separation.

Thereafter, his style underwent a radical simpli-fication, eschewing orthodox development, seeking to encapsulate the musical essence of each inspiration in a single short span.

Mr Hall said he has had talks with several publishers. \"I have been offered three situations on three national titles, but all of them have been below editorship,\" he said. He added that he would \"love to work on any of these\" but that the jobs on offer were not senior enough. Editorships arise rarely, but there could be an opportunity for Mr Hall at Express Newspapers following speculation that owner Richard Desmond is considering launching a new Sunday edition of the Daily Star. Friends say Mr Hall is \"bored\" working in public relations after the intensity of running the country's biggest newspaper. Mr Hall denied recent reports that he was going to be offered the editorship of Hello!, following speculation that editor Maggie Kuomi's position on the celebrity magazine may be under threat. And it is thought that the competition from the new \"common enemy\" of the Express and OK! has raised the stakes for Hello!, which is now seeking an editor with national newspaper leadership skills. Hello! publishing director Sally Cartwright was keen to quash the rumours. \"The truth at the moment is that the editor is under no pressure to resign,\" she said. But press reports have linked a series of other journalists with the job, including former Tatler editor Jane Procter and former OK! editor Richard Barber.",

      "body": "<p>For a martyr, Neil Lyndon looks in remarkable fettle. As anyone would who could easily pass as 10 years younger than he is (54). Nor is the man who claims his career was destroyed by a monstrous regiment of feminist media types selling the Big Issue while billeted in a cardboard box. He lives in a comfortable flat in Edinburgh, in the shadow of the cranes constructing the new Scottish parliament, while the house he is building, on a hillside overlooking the glorious Firth of Forth, nears completion. </p> <p>\"No, I'm doing fine now,\" he says. \"But it has taken me 10 years to get back to where I was. Last year, for the first time, I earned what I did in 1989. A decade to recover: it's a long time.\" </p> <p>Readers of the Sunday Times will know all about Lyndon and his life. For the past fortnight his story has dominated the paper. Under headlines such as \"Return of the heretic\" and \"Fighting the fundamentalists\", he has detailed how, since he began writing a series of critiques of feminism, culminating in a book called No More Sex War in 1991, he has been vilified. As a direct consequence of his writings, he reckons, he could not find work as a journalist, he was dropped by friends both male and female, he was assaulted while standing beside a luggage carousel at Heathrow, and, most seriously, he lost custody of his teenaged son. Which, presumably, was not what he was hoping when his work was published. </p> <p>\"No, what I was hoping was that I might stir up a bit of debate,\" he smiles. \"Oh, and I was hoping I might sell a few copies of the book.\" </p> <p>In fact, for Lyndon, all publicity turned out not to be good publicity. Despite being written about in every paper, despite being the subject of countless debates on radio, despite a publicity tour which saw dozens turn up to heckle him in bookshops, he sold only marginally more copies of his tome than Anthea Turner did of her recent autobiography. </p> <p>\"It reached its nadir when Yvonne Roberts wrote a book in answer to my book and for some reason known only to themselves, my publishers thought it would be a good idea to go on a publicity tour together and I stupidly agreed,\" he says. \"We'd go to bookshops, we'd both speak, nobody would listen to me, then, supposedly, we'd sign copies of our books. Except night after night, there'd be a great long queue at her table, while if I signed one of mine I was lucky.\" </p> <p>As his career imploded, there were no royalties to cushion his fall. In August 1992, he was declared bankrupt. </p> <p>Which makes you wonder: why is he revisiting the pain nearly 10 years on? Why not quietly get on with the business of reviving his career, writing about motoring for the Sunday Telegraph? It can't be out of pique that the car his paper has just given him to review is a Korean tin box which you would be embarrassed to be seen using to store your paper clips. So why has he done it? </p> <p>\"It was partly because I hoped to be more calmly received this time round,\" he says. \"But also I think it's really interesting what my story says about the treatment of dissidents in what is supposed to be an open society. Not for a moment would I compare myself with Salman Rushdie. It is nonsense to compare the phenomena. But I do find it paradoxical that many of the people who defended Rushdie's right to write whatever he wanted should be so censorious and destructive about wanting to limit my freedom to do the same. The way I was treated seemed to be a deliberate attempt to discourage interest in my book by lampooning me.\" </p> <p>Name names, here. Who exactly? </p> <p>\"Well, just one example: Helena Kennedy. She concluded her recommendation once in a round-up of books of the year with a plea to readers not to buy mine. No discussion, no criticism, just don't buy it.\" </p> <p>It was certainly true that, at the time, Lyndon's dismissal of feminism provoked some aggressive personal assaults. Looking back at the cuttings, there was not much discussion of the content of his writings, rather it was the size of penis, his ability to attract women and the fragrance of his breath that were called into question. One adjective was so routinely applied to him, you began to wonder if it was part of his name: the Inadequate Neil Lyndon. And though he claims that he laughed at the time, his Sunday Times essay last weekend concluded with this: \"And, yes, just in case anybody is wondering, I have got a lovely girlfriend. 'Magical' my son calls her. Some guys get all the luck.\" </p> <p>So if his aim was to reopen an intellectual debate on the nature of feminism, why did he feel the need to tell us he could still pull? </p> <p>\"Well, so many of the attacks were so personal, in a way I just wanted to prove that since they had got it so wrong about me, then it suggested they had got it wrong about my argument. It's difficult, you know. One doesn't want to get embroiled in this sort of thing, but when someone who has never met you writes in a national newspaper that you have only written the book because you can't attract women, it's hard not to point out that when you worked at Honey magazine and the news leaked that you were getting married, the female members of staff almost suffered a collective breakdown.\" </p> <p>Underneath all this is clearly a sense of hurt. Anecdotal evidence suggests that he had always been a popular sort of guy, that despite an ability sometimes to pick a fight in an empty room, through school, through university, at work, everyone liked Neil. So when he found himself a pariah, a public joke figure, his pride was wounded. </p> <p>\"Mmm, well, I was always the most popular kid at school, so I suppose it came as a shock,\" he says. \"But I was more shocked at what it revealed about the way anyone dissenting could be treated in our society. It really was Maoist.\" </p> <p>Which leads to the core of his complaint: that his life was systematically ruined by feminists bent on revenge. Does he have any evidence? </p> <p>\"Look, no editor actually told me to fuck off when I phoned up with an idea,\" he says, \"but you can tell. Honestly, when you are being cold-shouldered you know. Phone calls weren't returned, letters were ignored, perfectly good ideas for television series which I know, because I had plenty of experience of telly, would have at least got to the lunch meeting stage, didn't even get a reply. In 1989, I earned 70 grand from journalism. In 1991, I earned seven. That's tangible.\" </p> <p>There is, of course, another explanation: his ideas weren't very marketable. The only place in a newspaper where gender politics are discussed is in the women's pages, and a man with a specialisation in attacking their very purpose was hardly box office. As for men in other sections of the media, well I can't be alone in not being remotely interested in this sort of thing. And if I had ever been in a position to do so, I'm not sure Lyndon's was a campaign I could be bothered to champion: as a middle class white male, I don't honestly think of myself as a victim of discrimination. </p> <p>\"You're right,\" he says. \"A lot of men aren't interested, until they wind up in the divorce court and they discover that the system is absolutely stacked against them.\" </p> <p>This is perhaps the most compelling part of Lyndon's story. During a bitter divorce case soon after the furore over his book, he lost all rights of access to his son, and wasn't even able to speak to him for more than two years. </p> <p>\"Do you have children?\" he says. \"Just try to imagine what that is like, you can't even begin to comprehend how awful that is until it happens.\" </p> <p>But why did he believe this had anything to do with his feminist antagonists? </p> <p>\"Every day, my wife's QC would come into court with great piles of newspaper cuttings in which I was routinely denounced as mad, bad and dangerous,\" he says. \"I'm not suggesting the presiding judge in the Edinburgh court of sessions was a feminist, but I think he had a chivalrous instinct to protect my wife from a man who must have been a nutter, because every newspaper in the land said he was.\" </p> <p>Eventually, Lyndon was reunited with his son. Now 18, the youngster lives with him before taking up a place at Edinburgh University (the video of the men's movement's favourite movie Fight Club which lies next to Lyndon's television belongs, he is quick to point out, to the boy). </p> <p>These days the martyr is happy, solvent and excellent company. So chipper is he indeed, he has decided to return to the subject that made him briefly notorious 10 years ago. This time round, however, his work has caused hardly a ripple. Which suggests one of two things. Either, as Lyndon hopes, that much of what he suggested first time round - about males becoming second class citizens in health, education and divorce - is now being more regularly discussed, which means he does not appear such an iconoclast. Or, maybe it is something else. Maybe his campaign is such an idiosyncratic one, nobody has even noticed that Lyndon is on the warpath once more.</p>",

Sandy Ross, STV managing director, said: \"We believe we have satisfied all our obligations as an impartial and balanced broadcaster. \"However, it is simply not clear what is now being asked of us and until we receive that clarification we can only reserve our position.\" An ITC spokesman said it was for STV to decide how to comply with the direction, but made clear that the broadcaster did not necessarily have to offer an identical programme to the other three party leaders. \"It is now up to STV to come up with a formula before the byelection which is acceptable to the ITC,\" he added.",

      "body": "<p>When the classic movie epic, Ben-Hur (pictured), opened in 1926 at the Million Dollar theatre in Los Angeles, it ran continuously for six months. Gaylord Carter, who has died aged 95, was there every night playing the score, which he knew by heart, at the console of one of 7,000 organs that proliferated across America during the silent film era. Only about 100 survive today, many as unplayed curiosities.</p> <p>At the keyboard in 1927 for Ernst Lubitsch's The Student Prince, Carter nimbly handled the Sigmund Romberg music to fit the jerky movements on screen. He also played the score when the first Phantom Of The Opera opened in California in 1925.</p> <p>He visited Europe, Britain and Australia, played the famous Wurlitzer at the Forest Lawn cemetery, and at such famous resorts of the 1920s and 1930s as the Avalon theatre on Santa Catalina Island, the Pasadena civic auditorium, and, in recent years, at the massive glass-and-steel Crystal Cathedral in Orange Grove, California.</p> <p>Carter often composed his own background music to the early silent films - he could sound a bugle call, imitate a gong, strike a percussive note for a comedian's pratfall, and conjure up ominous chords for villains, heroic music for battles, and dreamy passages for love scenes. \"At its best, the music is felt but not noticed,\" he said. \"When it's right, you should lose yourself in the picture.\"</p> <p>He was born in Weisbaden, Germany, and emigrated to Wichita, Kansas, with his parents as a child. He took six months of piano lessons and another six at the organ, and by the age of 10 was accompanying the services at his local congregational church. At 14, he began playing in a cinema for children's matinees.

      "bodyText": "When the classic movie epic, Ben-Hur (pictured), opened in 1926 at the Million Dollar theatre in Los Angeles, it ran continuously for six months. Gaylord Carter, who has died aged 95, was there every night playing the score, which he knew by heart, at the console of one of 7,000 organs that proliferated across America during the silent film era. Only about 100 survive today, many as unplayed curiosities. At the keyboard in 1927 for Ernst Lubitsch's The Student Prince, Carter nimbly handled the Sigmund Romberg music to fit the jerky movements on screen. He also played the score when the first Phantom Of The Opera opened in California in 1925. He visited Europe, Britain and Australia, played the famous Wurlitzer at the Forest Lawn cemetery, and at such famous resorts of the 1920s and 1930s as the Avalon theatre on Santa Catalina Island, the Pasadena civic auditorium, and, in recent years, at the massive glass-and-steel Crystal Cathedral in Orange Grove, California. Carter often composed his own background music to the early silent films - he could sound a bugle call, imitate a gong, strike a percussive note for a comedian's pratfall, and conjure up ominous chords for villains, heroic music for battles, and dreamy passages for love scenes. \"At its best, the music is felt but not noticed,\" he said. \"When it's right, you should lose yourself in the picture.\" He was born in Weisbaden, Germany, and emigrated to Wichita, Kansas, with his parents as a child. He took six months of piano lessons and another six at the organ, and by the age of 10 was accompanying the services at his local congregational church. At 14, he began playing in a cinema for children's matinees. In 1922, Carter's family moved to Los Angeles, and he quickly began earning pocket money by playing for the films. Two years later, he was accompanying a Harold Lloyd comedy, The Kid, when the legendary actor and producer came to see how the film was doing. Impressed by Carter's playing, Lloyd hired him as his personal organist, and recommended him for a job at the Million Dollar theatre. It paid $110 a week, an astronomical wage for the time. Carter gave up his law studies at the University of California, using the money to put his sister and brother through college. During one of Lloyd's most famous scenes, when he is hanging off the hands of a clock high above a city street in Safety Last, Carter swung into the popular number, Time On My Hands. Lloyd was not amused and told him: \"Gaylord, I do the jokes.\" When the silent movie era ended, Carter switched to radio. For seven years, he played the introduction to television's Amos 'n' Andy show. In later life, he was rediscovered, and played at dozens of silent movie revivals.

      "bodyText": "Kelvin MacKenzie's Wireless Group has had its national analogue licence, TalkSport, renewed for a further eight years. Under the terms of the deal, the Wireless Group's annual cash bid payment to the Radio Authority has been slashed from \u00a34.3m to \u00a30.5m. The group, formed out of the old Talk Radio and headed by the former Sun editor, is the fourth largest national commercial radio group, following the acquisitions last year of the Radio Partnership and Independent Radio Group. Mr MacKenzie said the renewed licence would allow TalkSport \"to continue to invest in its future and move faster towards break-even\". A spokesman for TalkSport said the dramatic reduction in the payment to the Radio Authority was designed to give TalkSport to have \"greater financial flexibility\" over the period of the licence. He said that the two other national commercial licence holder, Virgin Radio and Classic FM, had also had their payments slashed.",

Barbara Stocking, who will join Oxfam on a \u00a375,000-a-year contract, was appointed as director of the NHS modernisation agency only in November, and took up her post on December 1. Her departure, scheduled for mid 2001, leaves the NHS without one of its most experienced, respected and high-profile female managers. It will inevitably lead to concerns that the so-called \"glass ceiling\" is still intact in the NHS - most of whose top managers are male - and is failing to hang on to its top women managers. At the time of her appointment Ms Stocking said part of her role at the modernisation agency was to develop a new NHS leadership centre that would \"make the most of our key resource - NHS staff\". The modernisation agency was set up by health secretary Alan Milburn to spearhead the introduction of good practice across the health service and implement the NHS plan. Ironically, her appointment to the agency was accompanied by criticisms that the NHS had breached equal opportunities policies by failing to advertise the job. Ms Stocking, who was previously south east regional director for the NHS, was the only woman seen as a contender for the NHS chief executive job, which went to Nigel Crisp in October. Only one woman made the top 15 most powerful people in the NHS Power 90 list published by societytheguardian.com - Royal College of Nursing general secretary Christine Hancock, who is quitting her job in the new year. However, Ms Stocking was replaced on a temporary basis at NHS south east region by a woman - Ruth Carnall, chief executive of east Kent health authority. Ms Stocking will manage a \u00a390m budget and a worldwide staff of 2,600 at Oxfam, where she replaces David Bryer, who is leaving after 10 years. It is unclear whether Ms Stocking, who was unavailable for comment, knew she may be leaving for Oxfam when she agreed to take up the modernisation agency job \"for an initial period of six months\".",

      "bodyText": "The BBC is set to launch a flagship TV news bulletin for teenagers and 20-somethings. BBC News is poring over plans to put BBC Choice's successful youth magazine programme, Liquid News, at the centre of its strategy for the new digital youth channel, BBC3. The programme would be transformed into a regular news bulletin based largely around showbusiness and entertainment. Liquid News, which was launched earlier this year under the auspices of executive producer Chris Wilson, focuses solely on entertainment, and has been a minor hit with younger viewers. It covers all the mainstream showbiz stories such as today's news about a man convicted of stalking Gwyneth Paltrow. Mr Wilson is working on a project to build on the programme's success by creating a new bulletin aimed at the younger generation. BBC3 will face the challenge of attracting enough younger viewers to justify its licence fee funding, but also adhering to the BBC's public service charter. A BBC News insider said: \"Young people are not interested in news unless it's Liam Gallagher. There will have to be a lot of entertainment news at the heart of BBC3 to make it compelling for the audience.\" But a BBC Choice spokeswoman stressed that no details about the programming strategy for BBC3 had been finalised. She added that the BBC's new digital channels were still undergoing public consultation. But the move could herald a concerted effort on the part of the corporation to attract new showbusiness reporting talent, an area that has not been a central focus until now.",

A cross-Europe study suggests shortcomings in about seven in 10 cases, including researchers seeking consent when mothers were still overwhelmed by the birth, failing to give parents sufficient information or not telling them they could change their minds and withdraw their babies. It also found that consent was three times more likely to be \"compromised\" when the research was considered urgent.

      "body": "<p>On a calm day you can smell the cod in Grimsby three miles inland. Not now. A gale force nine is ripping through the streets of the huge old Victorian docks. It lashes the shiny new food processing works, the semi-derelict engineering factories, the chandlers, the ropeworks, landing bays, paintshops and repair yards. It whips up the litter, bends the grass horizontal on the desolate wasteground, and whistles through the broken windows of the old ice works. </p> <p>There's no one out to sea and the water is turbulent even in the main harbour where the Beverley, Soraya, Rachel, Aisha and 30 other small fishing vessels, together with two deep sea trawlers, are lashed together and to the docksides. They are vulnerable and mainly venerable, the remnants of the 300-strong North Sea fishing fleet that was based in Grimsby only 30 years ago. </p> <p>In this foul weather and confused political climate they are going nowhere. But some time later tonight, if the forecast is better, Billy \"the Fish\" Hardie, skipper of the 50-tonne Stormy C, will call his three crewmen - Dave, Basher and Gilly - and set off on the 90-mile journey towards the Netherlands and the shoals of cod. The trip will take 20 hours and they will be away for up to eight days. </p> <p>Hardie will concentrate on the old wrecks where cod congregate at this time of year. He will think like a fish. When the tide is coming in he will drop his gill nets on the side of the wrecks where he knows the cod will be sheltering and feeding off the plankton and smaller fish; and then, when the tide flows out, like them, he will be round the other side. With skill and luck he will avoid the other fishermen and follow the cod's mysterious migrations across the Brown Banks, the Borkum Flats, the Cleaver Bank, the Dogger Bank and the Clay Deep. </p> <p>But right now Hardie is sitting in a Grimsby bowling club feeling as furious as the weather. European scientists have declared that cod stocks in the North Sea and to the west of Scotland are collapsing because of overfishing. The fish that the British have adopted as part of their culture for more than 100 years are said by conservation groups, such as the World Wildlife Fund, to be so rare that in places they are officially an endangered species. </p> <p>The North Sea, marine scientists say, is in danger of going the way of the Newfoundland Grand Banks. In the 80s it was the world's most fished ground - so much so that fish virtually disappeared and stocks have never fully recovered. </p> <p>Hardie knows that he and other fishermen in Britain are about to be gutted. They have had plenty of warning. Early this morning EU fisheries ministers meeting in Brussels imposed savage cuts on all EU cod and other North Sea fishing quotas. The cuts will affect the British most. Coming on top of similar cuts in the past two years, it means the virtual end of cod fishing in European waters. </p> <p>Instead of the Stormy C being allowed to catch 170-plus tonnes of cod next year, Hardie will be limited to just a few tonnes a month - the amount, in better times, he could have caught in a few weeks. </p> <p>Thirty months ago, Hardie invested almost \u00a3250,000 in the Stormy C, its licences and quotas. Today he regrets it. One of the most successful fishermen of his generation, he faces bankruptcy - not for bad management, lack of salesmanship or marketing, nor because subsidies are being phased out, but, he says, simply because he has done exactly what the scientists, the governments and all the other \"experts\" have told him was necessary to save the cod. </p> <p>Britain now has 15,000 full-time fishermen, with the industry concentrated in northern Scotland. It has 435 deep sea trawlers and 1,782 inshore vessels such as Hardie's. Most are owned by families, and small groups of friends or partners, and they are the ones who will be hit hardest by the EU cuts. </p> <p>Cod is their biggest and most valuable catch. The British have a bizarre love affair with the fish. We eat a third of the world's catch and are desperately loyal to the species, unlike the Americans or continental Europeans who are more than happy to eat other fish. We love its moistness and pale taste. But we may not love what is going to happen in the next few months. </p> <p>Few fishermen, it is widely reckoned, will survive the quota cuts if they last more than a few years. They do not have the option, like farmers, of switching \"crops\". A cod boat is set up for a certain sort of fishing and would cost tens of thousands of pounds to convert to catching, say, mackerel. Nor can they sell up because no one will buy a boat in such hard times. So far, neither the government nor the EU is offering to pay them not to fish - like they pay farmers to set aside land - or to decommission them completely. Their lifetime investments are worth little and their bank managers are already writing letters. </p> <p>\"It's a ruddy awful mess,\" Hardie says. \"I'm not being greedy and I understand the need for conservation, but I need 170-odd tonnes to make this business viable. This isn't a hobby. If it goes on like this I predict that 70% or more of the entire British fishing fleet will go to the wall. That's the end of Britain as a seafaring nation. It's the end of more communities, more skills. Once the fishing has gone, it will never come back. You will never be able to find crews, set up the infrastructures and start again. That's it.\" </p> <p>Hardie has been here before. In the 70s he became, at 21, one of the youngest skippers of a deep sea trawler. Just like his father, also a skipper, he fished from the north of Russia to Greenland and all points in the Atlantic. He took part in the \"cod wars\" with Iceland and then watched his local MP, Anthony Crosland, who was then a Labour foreign secretary, \"give away half of what had until then been British fishing rights\". </p> <p>The fleet was devastated. Grimsby and many other coastal towns never fully recovered. \"It used to be pay day every day,\" he says. \"There would be dozens of boats coming in every day, each paying men three or four weeks wages. The town was thriving.\" </p> <p>Hardie was jobless and young, so he gambled. He bought a gill netter and learned to fish the North Sea for cod. It paid off. Today he drives a BMW convertible, but not for long, he thinks. </p> <p>His anger, shared by fishermen in Hull, Petershead and the Scottish ports, is directed mainly at successive governments over the past 20 years. \"They have consistently traded off our fishing rights for political advantage in Europe,\" he says. \"What is it about fishing? This is the most risky business in the world. We lose many men every year. We die but we do not complain because that is the culture of fishing. But cannot any British government support us? Tell me why not. Other governments subsidise their fleets, protect their interests. Ours doesn't. Other governments help people invest in new ships. Ours doesn't.\" </p> <p>Hardie does not even believe that there is a full-scale crisis in the North Sea. \"Fishing has always gone in cycles. There are lots of signs that next year will be better. The scientists only go to certain places. They don't talk to us.\" </p> <p>He recognises he sounds like an extremist - which he says he isn't by nature - but admits he is ready now to blockade ports and try to embarrass the government at every point. He believes the public is on the side of the fishermen and there is talk about concentrating direct action efforts to coincide with an election. \"They are going to make us bankrupt so we may as well go down fighting. We could stop the Humber by this time tomorrow.\" </p> <p>Grimsby will escape the worst, ironically because it was hit so hard after the cod wars. Then it started to turn itself round from a fishing port to a food processing one and now it boasts Heinz, Baxters, Birds Eye, Northern Foods and other food giants such as Bluecoat. The football team is still called the Mariners, but the port is slowly de-linking itself with its fishy past, calling itself \"the food town\". </p> <p>It's another matter in Scotland. The Scots catch 60% of British cod and the small fishing ports of Fraserburgh, Scrabster, Mallaig and Lochinver, which have only limited processing facilities and are mostly dependent on the boats, will be the worst hit. The Scottish fishermen's association is scathing about the confusion, lack of scientific certainty and crude operation of the EU's fishing policy. But it is pragmatic about the changes it accepts are necessary. </p> <p>\"Anything less than decommissioning [boats] risks both fish stocks and fishing communities collapsing,\" says a spokesman. But he predicts real hardship if no acceptable money is made available and the government continues to allow businesses to fail. \"It would be very great indeed. The fishing jobs are concentrated in small communities with no alternative economic activity. </p> <p>\"Perhaps the greatest irony [of not decommissioning or compensating fully] would be that the very conservation objectives generating the social dislocation would be completely compromised if fishermen, left to twist in the wind, sought to do what was necessary to pay the bills. Conservation would be the first casualty. Government should bear in mind that fishermen are also an endangered species.\" </p> <p>Hardie and others take this to mean that fishermen will carry on fishing and simply duck below the surface to survive. Just like the cod. </p> <p><strong>Related stories</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/fish/story/0,7369,411756,00.html\">Cod quotas reduced to all-time low</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/fish/story/0,7369,411763,00.html\">Overfishing brings more bad news to struggling ports</a> </p> <p> <strong>Interactive</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/flash/0,5860,351825,00.html\">Guide to the fish stocks crisis</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/flash/0,5860,351828,00.html\">Play the interactive fishing game</a> </p> <p> <strong>Useful links</strong><br> <a href=\"http://europa.eu.int/comm/dgs/fisheries/index_en.htm\">European commission fisheries directorate</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.nffo.org.uk/\" target=\"_new&quot;>National Federation of Fishermen\" s organisations< a> </a><a href=\"http://www.unep.org\">UN Environment Programme</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org\">Greenpeace</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>The Republican team which will soon take control of the White House has a single big idea about the relationship of the US with the rest of the world, which is that what other countries secretly crave is assertive American leadership. This magic ingredient is supposed to dissolve all the differences, some of them grave, which have already set America at odds with most other nations, including close allies, and which will certainly increase under a Republican administration. Unhappily the big idea is deeply flawed, since it involves a romanticisation of the past and a misunderstanding of the present.</p> <p>Leadership, as presented by George W Bush and his advisers, is less a real policy than a shaky intellectual construct which enables them to get over the undeniable fact that much of what a Republican White House will want to do is unpalatable even to America's best friends. It draws on a Republican \"history\" in which Reagan's escalation of the arms race, regarded as dangerously over the top by the allies, in fact led to the end of the cold war, and in which Bush senior's firm approach brought victory in the Gulf.</p> <p>It also draws, going further back, on what was genuinely a cyclic pattern in the affairs of the Atlantic alliance, with America proposing to its European allies changes, usually in weapons deployment, which they initially found alarming but later accepted. There was, on this account, a golden age of American decision-making to which, after the fumbling and floundering of the Clinton years, the world can now return.</p> <p>So the assumption is that Russia, Europe and China will soon see that an American missile defence system is necessary and that it will not undermine arms control. The Europeans, the UN and others will also quickly grasp that it is quite right that the US contribute neither money nor soldiers to humanitarian operations, since America make its contribution to world security in so many other, more important, ways.</p> <p>The Europeans will understand, in time, that it is not the business of the 82nd Airborne Division to escort children to school in Kosovo, in Condoleezza Rice's well known example, while it is perfectly reasonable to expect British or Italian troops to do so. They will also take in that, while it is proper that they should create new military capacity, this should only be used when and how America wants it to be used.</p> <p>They will eventually go along with an American definition of the central problem in the Middle East as a mysterious Palestinian refusal to accept a very fair bargain. And the world in general will understand that the US has little interest in an International Criminal Court and in more than minimal environmental agreements, and that it cannot, for very good reasons, join in any ban on land mines.</p> <p>The first Republican error here is the old one of believing that what America does abroad, particularly what it does militarily, is done for all and should be appreciated by all. The $300bn annually spent on the military are thus a \"public good\" contributed to the world by Americans and for which they surely deserve some compensation.</p> <p>Out of this comes the burden-sharing philosophy which, for instance, allows Americans to think that having 11,000 troops in the Balkans is a wildly generous arrangement, and some Americans, apparently including the president-elect at one point, to blunder along under the impression that the US is policing the Balkans alone.</p> <p>Any idea that American military spending is, in the first place, to do with American national interests, with American fantasies of encirclement and attack and with the political competition between the parties to appear most ready to meet these alleged threats puts burden-sharing in a different light. American arms have indeed been vital to the world in the past and could be vital in the future, but that is far from the whole story of American military power.</p> <p>The second error is to imagine that laying out your policy and then saying \"Like it or lump it\" constitutes leadership. Leadership involves convincing and enthusing others. When others go along in spite of being unconvinced it is either because they have been coerced or because, over a long period of decision-making they have seen enough success to swallow their doubts in a particular instance.</p> <p>This is why the Republicans invoke Bush senior and Reagan.

      "bodyText": "The Republican team which will soon take control of the White House has a single big idea about the relationship of the US with the rest of the world, which is that what other countries secretly crave is assertive American leadership. This magic ingredient is supposed to dissolve all the differences, some of them grave, which have already set America at odds with most other nations, including close allies, and which will certainly increase under a Republican administration. Unhappily the big idea is deeply flawed, since it involves a romanticisation of the past and a misunderstanding of the present. Leadership, as presented by George W Bush and his advisers, is less a real policy than a shaky intellectual construct which enables them to get over the undeniable fact that much of what a Republican White House will want to do is unpalatable even to America's best friends. It draws on a Republican \"history\" in which Reagan's escalation of the arms race, regarded as dangerously over the top by the allies, in fact led to the end of the cold war, and in which Bush senior's firm approach brought victory in the Gulf. It also draws, going further back, on what was genuinely a cyclic pattern in the affairs of the Atlantic alliance, with America proposing to its European allies changes, usually in weapons deployment, which they initially found alarming but later accepted. There was, on this account, a golden age of American decision-making to which, after the fumbling and floundering of the Clinton years, the world can now return. So the assumption is that Russia, Europe and China will soon see that an American missile defence system is necessary and that it will not undermine arms control. The Europeans, the UN and others will also quickly grasp that it is quite right that the US contribute neither money nor soldiers to humanitarian operations, since America make its contribution to world security in so many other, more important, ways. The Europeans will understand, in time, that it is not the business of the 82nd Airborne Division to escort children to school in Kosovo, in Condoleezza Rice's well known example, while it is perfectly reasonable to expect British or Italian troops to do so. They will also take in that, while it is proper that they should create new military capacity, this should only be used when and how America wants it to be used. They will eventually go along with an American definition of the central problem in the Middle East as a mysterious Palestinian refusal to accept a very fair bargain. And the world in general will understand that the US has little interest in an International Criminal Court and in more than minimal environmental agreements, and that it cannot, for very good reasons, join in any ban on land mines. The first Republican error here is the old one of believing that what America does abroad, particularly what it does militarily, is done for all and should be appreciated by all. The $300bn annually spent on the military are thus a \"public good\" contributed to the world by Americans and for which they surely deserve some compensation. Out of this comes the burden-sharing philosophy which, for instance, allows Americans to think that having 11,000 troops in the Balkans is a wildly generous arrangement, and some Americans, apparently including the president-elect at one point, to blunder along under the impression that the US is policing the Balkans alone. Any idea that American military spending is, in the first place, to do with American national interests, with American fantasies of encirclement and attack and with the political competition between the parties to appear most ready to meet these alleged threats puts burden-sharing in a different light. American arms have indeed been vital to the world in the past and could be vital in the future, but that is far from the whole story of American military power. The second error is to imagine that laying out your policy and then saying \"Like it or lump it\" constitutes leadership. Leadership involves convincing and enthusing others. When others go along in spite of being unconvinced it is either because they have been coerced or because, over a long period of decision-making they have seen enough success to swallow their doubts in a particular instance. This is why the Republicans invoke Bush senior and Reagan. There is a lot of room for argument about any simple cause and effect relationship between Reagan's policies and Soviet reform and then disintegration. But even setting that aside, the continuity to which Republicans appeal is fractured, not least by the foreign policy mistakes of the Clinton years, mistakes to which partisan Republicans in the House and Senate contributed so much. Would Clinton have dithered so much on the Balkans had he not been fearful of Republican attacks? Would there have been such an unthinking response to the Asian economic crisis without Republican influence? Would Clinton have embraced national missile defence had the Republicans not made such an issue of it? And would not the US now be a signatory to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty had the Republicans in the Senate not voted the treaty down? The Clinton administration's worst failure, in the Middle East, owes little to Republican sabotage. Even so, it does not add to the body of trust in American leadership. This is especially the case since the Republicans, even though in the past they were a little readier than the Democrats to apply pressure to the Israelis, are unlikely to be so bold this time round. The third error in Republican strategy is also a product of the destructive partisanship of the last eight years. In spite of all the rhetoric about Bush reaching for the political centre and the Democrats responding to his sincere efforts, the reality is that Republicans in the House and the Senate - not all of them but enough of them - did their best to ruin Clinton's policies. Why then should Democrats ease Bush's path, when everybody agrees that campaigning for the 2002 Congressional elections has already begun? It will be hard to exercise international leadership when American decisions are seen abroad as the almost accidental product of bitter political battling at home. The weird outcome of the election certainly makes it harder for the Republicans to be the international decision-makers they aspire to be. But the essence of their problem is that, far more than the Democrats, they embody the contradictions of American society - the sense of entitlement to world power allied to the sense that they are being asked to take too much responsibility for others, the worship of military strength allied to a deep disinclination to use it and the desire to be in charge allied to the desire to be left alone.

If law and order won it for Dubya, maybe it can win it for William too. The phrase \"liberal elite\" is American, something that may exist on the East Coast, in the Ivy League or the New York Review of Books world, but has never wielded power this side of the Atlantic, or not since Asquith and the death of liberal England. </p> <p>Who is this liberal elite? My own name is the only one to feature in Hague's speech to the Centre for Policy Studies yesterday - a great honour. But the truth is, if one columnist from the small sliver of the British press that is to the left of centre is the best he can find, it shows how pitifully thin on the ground liberals must be. It is quite difficult to be an elite of just one. This happens frequently with the anti-liberal rants in the Sun or far-right commentators: in all their fulminations about this shadowy but immensely powerful liberal entity they can never think of anyone within shouting distance of government to call liberal. New Labour never has been liberal. Hague only mentions Jack Straw's name once. Why? Because no one hearing his name thinks this government is run by a bunch of lily-livered limousine-liberals. </p> <p>Out there in the 70% of the press that is not just to the right, but these days far right, there is a plethora of comment pouring out of the pens of the likes of Peter Hitchens, Bruce Anderson, Michael Gove, Boris Johnson, Peter Mackay, Janet Daley, Melanie Phillips, Paul Johnson, Richard Littlejohn, Peter Dobie - I could fill the page with this roll of honour. Their words infuse the air the country breathes, serving just three press magnates whose pernicious influence corrodes all political discourse. </p> <p>Against these forces of conservatism the liberal voice is pathetically weak. The great majority of the population will rarely hear or read a liberal sentiment. That is why people believe crime is rising when it has fallen for six straight years right across the western world. Stoking up fear of crime is these rightwing commentators' black art, a fear deliberately inflamed to tip the people rightwards. </p> <p>The influence of this rightwing army spreads far wider than just the declining readership of newspapers. For all its claims of balance, inevitably the BBC's agenda uses these far-right fruitcakes as one marker, dragging the whole debate further over to the right than the general consensus. Take an issue like abortion: 85% consistently support it in opinion polls, yet the BBC always has an archaic anti-abortion voice in every embryo discussion, a Victoria Gillick in every contraception debate, simply because the threatening but unrepresentative noise of the rightwing press demands this as \"balance\". So too with most other issues. It is time the BBC recentred itself, ignoring the cacophony of the press. It may be gratifying to be named as the liberal threat and enemy but how absurd: the liberal end of the rope is always tugged far to the right by the press bullies. </p> <p>As for Hague's speech, this is all desperate thrashing about by a failed leader of a failed party. Like a fish in a net, the more he thrashes, the more he is doomed. Since he took over the wreckage of the Conservative party he has made every navigational error, taken every wrong turn and has now beached it in the shallows on a desert island. His issue, Europe, is a dead duck now. Once the strongest genuine difference between the parties, firm ground on which to stand and fight, it turned to quicksand on Monday when Tony Blair returned from Nice with all his QMVs and weighted votes in place - no inch of flesh vulnerable to the Eurosceptics. </p> <p>Every other issue has turned to dust in Hague's inept hand. His tax cut guarantee demolished, he is left pledging implied billions on everything he mentions yet each time he promises more nurses, police or teachers his tax cuts look the more implausible and undesirable. The more he describes the plight of public services, the more voters are reminded of the need for more public money. </p> <p> His fantasy economics promised yesterday 10 more secure training centres for 1,000 young offenders. Each place costs \u00a3403 per day yet he refuses to commit to matching, let alone increasing law and order spending. All that is left for a man stagnant at one third in the polls, with only an aging cohort of supporters, is to rant. </p> <p>The last refuge of desperate conservatism is always race. Hague's speech is racist in every sentiment, linking crime with colour, blaming Macpherson and fewer random stop and searches on black youths for street crime. Even those words sympathising with the honest black community's suffering as prime victims of crime only serves to fix the black/crime connection more firmly. Forget the experimental baseball cap and coconut at the Notting Hill carnival - it will be black crime and asylum seekers from now on. If the election campaign begins this low, it will sink below anything ever seen in this country by election day. </p> <p>Do race and extreme illiberalism on single parents, gays, abortion or sex education really pay political dividends? From the timbre of the British press an outsider might presume that the soul of the country resides within the black heart of Paul Dacre, editor of the Daily Mail. Luckily it does not. (Only 14% of Mail readers ever voted Labour). The British Social Attitudes survey reveals a country far more progressive - at ease on all these issues, uncensorious about personal morality. In the world of Goodness Gracious Me and Lenny Henry, Britain, says the Runnymede Trust, is the least racist country in Europe. </p> <p>We liberals are closer to the majority. Hague is marooned in yesteryear with his shrinking blue-rinse party while we are swimming in the sea of pluralism, multiculturalism, complex families, difficult choices, all the muddle born of freedom. If we are the elite, that is because we are winning: British Social Attitudes shows people become more liberal the more educated they are. Conservatives have always been the stupid party. Graduates will soon be half the population, so Tories will be educated out of existence. To be liberal is to be free of superstition and irrational fear, open to the new, optimistic about the future, knowing there has never been a better time to be alive than now. </p> <p> Feedback: Proud to be a liberal?

A big clean-up by the council this year also led to removal of the poisoned ash from 14 footpaths, bridle paths and parks. Samples supplied to Newcastle's public health department revealed the ash contained mercury at 2,406% above accepted levels, cadmium at 785% above normal levels and lead at 136% above normal. </p> <p>The city council will now face 15 charges concerning allegations of illegally depositing waste, and of disposing of waste in a manner likely to pollute the environment or cause harm to human health under the Environmental Protection Act of 1990 and the environmental protection regulations of 1991. </p> <p>The council-appointed plant operator, Contract Heat and Power, faces four charges concerning duty of care offences and breaches of authorisation under the Environmental Protection Act 1990. All the offences carry unlimited fines on conviction. </p> <p>An environment agency spokesman said: \"If the agency believes that environmental legislation has been breached a number of courses of action can be taken. The most serious is to bring a prosecution and the agency believes this to be the appropriate response in the circumstances.\" </p> <p>When the Byker reclamation plant was built by the former Tyne and Wear council at a cost of \u00a34m more than 20 years ago, it was hailed as a breakthrough in recycling. It was the first of its kind in Europe to reclaim metal and turn household waste into fuel, which was burned to provide heat and hot water for thousands of homes in the neighbourhood. </p> <p>But before long residents began complaining of pungent smells and a rise in throat and nose complaints. The plant began falling short of targets and by 1993 council chiefs were considering closing it down. But it survived and in 1998 switched from burning refuse to burning coal. </p> <p>Plans are now being considered to expand the incinerator to burn some 80,000 tonnes of municipal waste and 13,000 tonnes of tyres - and this has led to strong protests. </p> <p>Mr Brown has also demanded an investigation by the environment agency into dioxin emissions from the incinerator .</p>",

The decision is certain to raise fears about the health dangers of incinerators which are being expanded under Labour as part of the government's initiative to reduce the level of landfill dumping. The reuse of ash from incinerators is being examined by a Commons environment committee inquiry, which is looking at the government's waste strategy. The city council had already banned children under the age of two from playing in 27 allotments and people were warned not to eat eggs or poultry there. A big clean-up by the council this year also led to removal of the poisoned ash from 14 footpaths, bridle paths and parks. Samples supplied to Newcastle's public health department revealed the ash contained mercury at 2,406% above accepted levels, cadmium at 785% above normal levels and lead at 136% above normal. The city council will now face 15 charges concerning allegations of illegally depositing waste, and of disposing of waste in a manner likely to pollute the environment or cause harm to human health under the Environmental Protection Act of 1990 and the environmental protection regulations of 1991. The council-appointed plant operator, Contract Heat and Power, faces four charges concerning duty of care offences and breaches of authorisation under the Environmental Protection Act 1990. All the offences carry unlimited fines on conviction. An environment agency spokesman said: \"If the agency believes that environmental legislation has been breached a number of courses of action can be taken. The most serious is to bring a prosecution and the agency believes this to be the appropriate response in the circumstances.\" When the Byker reclamation plant was built by the former Tyne and Wear council at a cost of \u00a34m more than 20 years ago, it was hailed as a breakthrough in recycling. It was the first of its kind in Europe to reclaim metal and turn household waste into fuel, which was burned to provide heat and hot water for thousands of homes in the neighbourhood. But before long residents began complaining of pungent smells and a rise in throat and nose complaints. The plant began falling short of targets and by 1993 council chiefs were considering closing it down. But it survived and in 1998 switched from burning refuse to burning coal. Plans are now being considered to expand the incinerator to burn some 80,000 tonnes of municipal waste and 13,000 tonnes of tyres - and this has led to strong protests. Mr Brown has also demanded an investigation by the environment agency into dioxin emissions from the incinerator .",

Rabbi Pini Dunner of the Saatchi orthodox synagogue, is also threatening to lead demonstrations outside Mr Loewenstein's parents' home if he refuses to comply. Only husbands can grant their wives gets and failure to do so means that the wife cannot be remarried in a synagogue, and offspring of future marriages are regarded as illegitimate. Mr Loewenstein, understood to be in his 50s and to have been married for two years while living in the US, was unavailable to comment last night.",

My own name is the only one to feature in Hague's speech to the Centre for Policy Studies yesterday - a great honour. But the truth is, if one columnist from the small sliver of the British press that is to the left of centre is the best he can find, it shows how pitifully thin on the ground liberals must be. It is quite difficult to be an elite of just one. This happens frequently with the anti-liberal rants in the Sun or far-right commentators: in all their fulminations about this shadowy but immensely powerful liberal entity they can never think of anyone within shouting distance of government to call liberal.

So too with most other issues. It is time the BBC recentred itself, ignoring the cacophony of the press. It may be gratifying to be named as the liberal threat and enemy but how absurd: the liberal end of the rope is always tugged far to the right by the press bullies.</p> <p>As for Hague's speech, this is all desperate thrashing about by a failed leader of a failed party.

Hague's speech is racist in every sentiment, linking crime with colour, blaming Macpherson and fewer random stop and searches on black youths for street crime.

      "body": "<p>William Hague sparked protests from across the political spectrum yesterday after a provocative speech on crime in which he blamed the Macpherson report into the murder of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence for a collapse in police morale.</p> <p>Stephen's father, Neville, led the protests when he blamed the Tory leader for playing the race card in the run-up to the election. \"He has been desperate to play the race card and has found a way to do it here.\"</p> <p>Mr Lawrence's criticisms were echoed by politicians, senior police and the report's author.</p> <p>Mr Hague, who dismissed the criticisms, suffered embarrassment last night when it emerged that the main crime figures in his speech were wrong. Tory officials blamed a \"phrasing error\" for Mr Hague's assertion that the number of arrests by the Metropolitan police, following stop and searches, fell from 18,752 a month to 11,858 after the Macpherson report.</p> <p>Tory sources claimed the error was unimportant because the arrest figures showed a similar fall in real terms. These showed that arrests fell from 2,609 a month to 1,898.</p> <p>Mr Hague used the fall in stop and search arrests as an example of how the Macpherson report has hampered the work of police. The report accused the Met of \"institutional racism\" and raised concerns that police use stop and search powers against black people without good reason.</p> <p>In a speech to the rightwing Centre for Policy Studies, Mr Hague pledged to overturn the tide of liberal \"political correctness\" which he said had brought the criminal justice system to its knees.</p> <p>He went on: \"The next Conservative government will take on and defeat the attitude of the condescending liberal elite that has never trusted the police and now wants us to believe they are all racists. The tragedy of the Lawrence family and the further urgent work that needs to be done building up trust between our ethnic communities and the police do not excuse the way in which the Macpherson report has been used to brand every officer and every branch of the force as racist, has contributed directly to a collapse of police morale and recruitment and has led to a crisis on our streets.\"</p> <p>His remarks drew a withering response from Downing Street which branded the speech \"desperate and disreputable\". Alastair Campbell, the prime minister's official spokesman, said: \"Having lost on the economy, lost on the big arguments in Europe, his shadow home secretary having made a complete hash of their approach on law and order ... he is just casting around to get himself noticed.\"</p> <p>Sir William Macpherson denied his report had caused an increase in crime. \"I believe the police up and down the country are to be highly congratulated in buckling down and learning lessons from the report and attempting to put matters right,\" he said.</p> <p>The Police Federation offered Mr Hague support. Its chairman, Fred Broughton, said some officers did have a sense of vulnerability in dealing with minority ethnic suspects which was apparent with the \"negative effect on crime reduction.\"</p> <p>Tony Burden, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, backed Macpherson: \"It identified some important issues for the police service to tackle and we should not allow anything to divert us away from our determination to gain the confidence of the black community through fair and effective policing.\"</p> <p>The shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, welcomed her leader's promise to encourage more stop and search activities by the police, saying: \"We should all take the attitude that if we are stopped that is a cause of gratitude not resentment.\"</p> <p>But one former minister feared that after the Tories' recent fall in the polls, Mr Hague had decided to shore up hardcore voters on the right.</p> <p>Tory officials maintained that Mr Hague was speaking for the \"mainstream majority\".</p> <p>His speech coincided with Home Office research warning that the use of untargeted stop and search is one factor hampering police efforts to recruit black and Asian officers to their ranks.</p>",

      "bodyText": "William Hague sparked protests from across the political spectrum yesterday after a provocative speech on crime in which he blamed the Macpherson report into the murder of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence for a collapse in police morale. Stephen's father, Neville, led the protests when he blamed the Tory leader for playing the race card in the run-up to the election. \"He has been desperate to play the race card and has found a way to do it here.\" Mr Lawrence's criticisms were echoed by politicians, senior police and the report's author. Mr Hague, who dismissed the criticisms, suffered embarrassment last night when it emerged that the main crime figures in his speech were wrong. Tory officials blamed a \"phrasing error\" for Mr Hague's assertion that the number of arrests by the Metropolitan police, following stop and searches, fell from 18,752 a month to 11,858 after the Macpherson report. Tory sources claimed the error was unimportant because the arrest figures showed a similar fall in real terms. These showed that arrests fell from 2,609 a month to 1,898. Mr Hague used the fall in stop and search arrests as an example of how the Macpherson report has hampered the work of police. The report accused the Met of \"institutional racism\" and raised concerns that police use stop and search powers against black people without good reason. In a speech to the rightwing Centre for Policy Studies, Mr Hague pledged to overturn the tide of liberal \"political correctness\" which he said had brought the criminal justice system to its knees. He went on: \"The next Conservative government will take on and defeat the attitude of the condescending liberal elite that has never trusted the police and now wants us to believe they are all racists. The tragedy of the Lawrence family and the further urgent work that needs to be done building up trust between our ethnic communities and the police do not excuse the way in which the Macpherson report has been used to brand every officer and every branch of the force as racist, has contributed directly to a collapse of police morale and recruitment and has led to a crisis on our streets.\" His remarks drew a withering response from Downing Street which branded the speech \"desperate and disreputable\". Alastair Campbell, the prime minister's official spokesman, said: \"Having lost on the economy, lost on the big arguments in Europe, his shadow home secretary having made a complete hash of their approach on law and order ... he is just casting around to get himself noticed.\" Sir William Macpherson denied his report had caused an increase in crime. \"I believe the police up and down the country are to be highly congratulated in buckling down and learning lessons from the report and attempting to put matters right,\" he said. The Police Federation offered Mr Hague support. Its chairman, Fred Broughton, said some officers did have a sense of vulnerability in dealing with minority ethnic suspects which was apparent with the \"negative effect on crime reduction.\" Tony Burden, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, backed Macpherson: \"It identified some important issues for the police service to tackle and we should not allow anything to divert us away from our determination to gain the confidence of the black community through fair and effective policing.\" The shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, welcomed her leader's promise to encourage more stop and search activities by the police, saying: \"We should all take the attitude that if we are stopped that is a cause of gratitude not resentment.\" But one former minister feared that after the Tories' recent fall in the polls, Mr Hague had decided to shore up hardcore voters on the right. Tory officials maintained that Mr Hague was speaking for the \"mainstream majority\". His speech coincided with Home Office research warning that the use of untargeted stop and search is one factor hampering police efforts to recruit black and Asian officers to their ranks.",

One judge upheld death sentences against them, while the second acquitted them for lack of evidence. Their fate will now be decided by a third high court judge. News of the split decision angered supporters of the ruling Awami League and hundreds of angry activists immediately went on a rampage in the capital, Dhaka, damaging cars and throwing stones at police after they were prevented from entering the court premises. The authorities deployed 2,000 extra police as they attempted to protect the judges' homes. Legal experts said that given the importance of the case, involving the murder of the nation's founder, a decision could be expected shortly. A quick disposal of the case, independent observers said, could help the nation move forward by putting at rest, once and for all, the bitter past that has haunted the country for so long. Almost all the 15 officers were direct beneficiaries of the military coup that toppled the government of Sheikh Mujib 25 years ago. They were rewarded with plum diplomatic jobs overseas until the slain leader's daughter, Sheikh Hasina, became prime minister in 1996. The coup leaders were pampered by successive governments including the Bangladesh Nationalist party of the former prime minister Khaleda Zia. They were not only given overseas assignments, but their actions were indemnified by parliament. Of the 15, only four are now in custody in Dhaka, including the mastermind of the coup, retired Lieutenant Colonel Farukur Rahman.

      "bodyText": "In Mohammed Siddique's workshop craftsmen will make you any gun that you want. Cheap Kalashnikov working copies are in constant demand although pump-action shotguns are the new favourite of tribal leaders in neighbouring Afghanistan. For generations, Darra Adam Khel, a village caught in the steep valleys of Pakistan's federally administered but lawless tribal areas, has thrived as one of the world's largest unofficial arms markets. Nowadays, Darra has become an embarrassment to a military regime desperate to dam the flood of weapons flowing through Darra. The army wants the workshops to stop making and selling working guns and instead make replicas for display. \"People need guns here,\" said Mr Siddique. \"They have family feuds and they never forget if they are wronged. They will take revenge. You need a gun for protection.\" Two of Mr Siddique's men sit beside him on the workshop floor, wrapping greased gun barrels in copies of the Financial Times, preparing to send them to a customer in nearby Peshawar. \"God bless our home,\" says a sign above their heads. \"[Weapons are] the only source of income for these people. They have no agricultural land, no other source of money. It has been this way for generations,\" said Mr Siddique. At the small shops lining the main road, a cheap Kalashnikov copy sells for 2,500 rupees (about \u00a330), while a genuine one costs seven or eight times as much. Away from the street self-taught craftsmen copy working anti-aircraft guns, hand grenades, and rocket launchers. Occasionally, a customer walks out into the road and cracks off a volley into the air. The poor quality steel can affect accuracy, and occasionally causes a barrel to explode. Backpackers used to flock to Darra, eager to pick up a souvenir single-bullet pen pistol, but today, the area is almost off-limits to foreigners. It is local Pakistanis and Afghans who buy such wares now. Many locals keep weapons at home, ostensibly for hunting but mostly for show, while religious leaders need armed bodyguards.

Australia's justice minister Amanda Vanstone, said that the case could take up to two years if the alleged commander of a Nazi concentration camp and suspected member of a Latvian death squad sought a series of appeals. Mr Kalejs, of Latvian origin but granted Australian citizenship in 1957, appeared before Melbourne magistrates court, where he was stripped of his passport before being released on bail to reappear on January 25. Aivars Saulitis, of the Latvian Relief Society, part of Melbourne's close-knit Latvian community which has been sheltering the suspected war criminal, said Mr Kalejs was too senile to defend himself in court. \"He can't hear properly or make much sense,\" Mr Saulitis was reported as saying. Lawyers for Mr Kalejs argue he is too sick to travel and stand trial in the Latvian capital, Riga. Mr Kalejs had been living in a Leicestershire retirement home after he was deported from Canada in 1997 and from the US three years earlier. His arrest in Australia follows the recent signing of an extradition treaty between Australia and Latvia. The Baltic state has spent most of this year preparing a case against Mr Kalejs, after appealing for international help in compiling a dossier of evidence. In September, Latvian prosecutors formally accused him of being a guard at the Salaspils concentration camp near Riga. Mr Kalejs has admitted he served alongside officers from the notorious Arajs Kommando, a Latvian unit responsible for the deaths of 30,000 Jews and Gypsies during the Nazi occupation of Latvia from 1941 to 1944. But he claims he was studying at university when the killings occurred.",

      "bodyText": "The Ukrainian government is shuddering under the weight of a mounting corruption scandal, involving the president Leonid Kuchma, a series of secretly taped foul-mouthed conversations and a headless corpse, believed to be that of a missing journalist. A parliamentary committee spent yesterday attempting to wade through a mire of allegations to establish the truth at the heart of the case. They were examining the testimony of a former presidential bodyguard who claimed to have placed a digital tape recorder under the president's sofa, recording conversations in which Mr Kuchma allegedly ordered senior officials to dispose of the journalist. These tapes were made public by the head of the opposition Socialist party, Oleksandr Moroz, who described them as irrefutable evidence linking Mr Kuchma to the disappearance of Georgy Gongadze, the editor of a Ukrainian internet newspaper which focused on corruption. The president has denied that it is his voice on the tape and has initiated a slander action. \"A large-scale provocation is taking place,\" a spokesman quoted Mr Kuchma as saying. Dutch experts say the tapes do not appear to have been edited or tampered with, although no one has been able to prove that the voice belongs to the president. Mr Gongadze disappeared on September 16. Amid growing pressure for a thorough investigation, Mr Kuchma said he would oversee the case himself but no breakthroughs have been made. The former security service officer, Major Mykola Melnichenko, said he began bugging the president after becoming dismayed by the abuses of power he witnessed in the top levels of government. He said he hoped to \"stop this regime's criminal activity\". He is in hiding abroad. On the tapes, a voice similar to the president's can be heard discussing in crude language the best way to get rid of \"the bastard\" Mr Gongadze. There is no discussion in the tapes of murder and eventually they opt for a kidnap operation. \"I'm telling you, dispose of him; throw him out. Give him to the Chechens... [indecipherable] and then ransom him,\" the voice orders. \"Strip him, shit, leave him without his pants. Let him sit. Get it done simply, shit.\" A headless, disfigured corpse was found near Kiev on November 3. Investigators said it was impossible to identify the body because the head could not be found and its hands had been treated in acid to remove the fingerprints. But Mr Gongadze's family are convinced the body is his; jewellery belonging to him is said to have been found with the corpse and an x-ray to his left hand revealed traces of shrapnel - he injured the hand when he worked as a war correspondent. Mr Kuchma has accused his opponents of trying to trigger a national crisis, just as international attention focuses on Ukraine for today's closure of the Chernobyl nuclear plant. He has also claimed that the whole affair has been orchestrated by western secret services, alarmed by the new bonds Ukraine is forging with Russia. Other commentators have suggested that Gongadze's death may have been ordered by powerful business figures, damaged by reports in his Ukrainska Pravda. Alexander Lavrinovich, the head of the parliamentary commission investigating the disappearance, said: \"The remains of the body were brought to Kiev in the middle of November and we still don't have a positive identification - an unusually long time. \"No one has revealed what kind of analyses are being carried out and how much longer the process will continue for, which undermines one's confidence in the whole process. \"We are also concerned that no official examination of the tapes has been conducted; this is the responsibility of the prosecutors' office, which has been sent the tapes; we don't even know whether they intend to do this.\"",

      "body": "<p>I have lived with my husband for 10 years - we married 18 months ago. Six years ago, his brother moved in with us and a year later, his sister also moved in. Three years ago the brother moved out but the sister's boyfriend moved in. They work night shifts, so I rarely see them during the week. My husband is an insomniac and so also tends to work through the night and into the late morning. He also gets severe headaches. I work a normal day in comparison, although a fairly busy and stressful one at that.</p> <p>My problem is our sex life. At first, it was fantastic but over the years we have taken each other for granted and now the only time we have sex is when he asks for it when he has been drinking. I am not happy with this situation but it is one that I have got used to. I feel we have lost our way over the years and he complains that I never instigate sex. However, I think that his headaches and our differing hours, and also living with his family, have made it difficult for me to be spontaneous. I love my husband and I would rather die than lose him. We get on brilliantly otherwise.</p> <p><b> Get his family out</b><br> The extended family will have to go. How can you have a successful marriage and private life with them encroaching on your personal space? There are territorial issues here in that you are currently a minority, an outsider in your own home, and these tensions in turn are putting pressure on your husband. Where do his loyalties lie? I would have thought that you would be his priority but family pressure can be intense. This is probably the underlying cause of his headaches, and maybe the insomnia. So remove the cause (the siblings) and hopefully the symptoms will go, too. My partner and I happily lived with a friend for a few years but when I became pregnant I just wanted my own space to start our family life. It would be best to sort this out now to avoid potential bitterness and before your husband is forced to take sides. <br><b> Name and address withheld</b></p> <p><b> Make time to talk</b><br> I felt a rush of sympathy when I read your letter. You sound completely isolated from the people living in your house - and that includes your husband. What's worse, you may well be isolated from your own feelings about your lodgers' presence and your husband's distance. No one would expect sexuality to thrive in these conditions. This is not just \"losing your way\" but rushing downhill towards destroying a relationship that you passionately want to keep.</p> <p>This is why it's worth having a thorough review of your whole life-style. You must make time to talk. The situation clearly doesn't suit you but does he never have doubts and long for a change? Does he realise how dreadfully you're being taken for granted - he's expecting you to meet his needs without giving a thought to meeting yours. He really has to see the way things are going and to understand how much is at risk. <br><b> A Waters, Norfolk</b></p> <p><b> Get professional help</b><br> It sounds to me as if you and your husband are quite badly stressed and could have emotional problems, too. I say this because I had a very similar situation in the early years of our marriage. Like your husband, mine slept very badly, had daily headaches and bouts of anxiety and became impotent. He resisted help for a long time, just as I resisted admitting just how resentful and unhappy I was at the lack of sex or any intimacy. When we finally went to Relate (then Marriage Guidance) it emerged that we were very needy people ourselves, low in self-esteem and depressed. With help we recognised how this was damaging us emotionally and we were able to \"heal\" each other.

I received a reply from her solicitor stating that if I write to her again she will take me to court for harassment.

      "body": "<p>Take heart. Amid the chaos and the queues of despairing families trying vainly to get a seat on ticket-only Christmas services, Britain's rail system - or at least the public face of it - is experiencing substantial investment. That's what Railtrack says, anyway.</p> <p>About 85% of rail services will be back to normal by the end of January, the government also said yesterday. And Mr Prescott added: \"Our job is to get behind Railtrack at the moment,\" as he announced the government's five-year \u00a38.4bn local transport spending plan</p> <p>But the 36,000 passengers travelling daily through Newcastle upon Tyne's magnificent Central Station would have great difficulty matching the awful reality of daily travel with the virtual world of Railtrack as they pass its lavish exhibition, featuring old prints, photographs and the latest audiovisual wizardry.</p> <p>The beleaguered privatised company is celebrating the 150th anniversary of the grade-one listed station, opened by Queen Victoria. In a city where George Stephenson built the first locomotives - and where his engineering son, Robert, built great rail bridges and managed rail infrastructure better than Railtrack - the irony is not lost on the long-suffering passenger, or the unfortunate train crews trying desperately to smile amid disorder. They know that things can only get worse over the next few days.</p> <p>The exhibition speaks much about the priorities of Railtrack in putting station improvements ahead of track renewal until very recently. In glossy leaflets the company talks proudly of spending \u00a326m refurbishing its fine \"cathedral\" designed in classical style by the renowned Newcastle architect, John Dobson.</p> <p>It has incorporated a trendy cafe-bar advertising cut-price liquor and speaks of many retail opportunities underneath the station's towering portico. Exploiting property assets was considered of far more importance than improving the network when Railtrack was given away cheap for \u00a31.8bn during the dying days of the last government.</p> <p>But the east coast operator, GNER, will be running only 60% services - and insisting all travel must be ticket-only - on what was the country's fastest line, between Edinburgh and London, over the seasonal period. Some 180,000 people will have to find alternative transport, although, as the Rail Passengers Council claim, this breaks a fundamental convention of the network - that people should be able to turn up and go.</p> <p>The full horror of travel soon becomes apparent on the 300-mile journey from Newcastle to London. \"Christmas is going to be hell,\" says a restaurant car attendant. \"They're putting us all on barrier duty.\" Scores of staff are being reassigned to keep order. British Transport Police, it is said, have cancelled all leave.</p> <p>It's chaos. Just soak up the spectacle of a 300-mile-long construction site that once passed for Britain's fastest railway. But clearly chaos seems a world away from the air-conditioned calm of Whitehall. It is something for lesser mortals to endure.</p> <p>At around \u00a3140 for a standard return - \u00a3220 if you opt for a little leg room in first class - chaos does not come cheap. On the most expensive system in Europe, there are no concessions, no complimentary refreshments to lubricate the parched tongue on a five-hour (if you're lucky) journey that used to take three.</p> <p>With a Christmas travel crisis approaching, road traffic up by at least 25% and many more domestic aircraft pumping more hydrocarbons into the atmosphere - not to mention daily horror stories from outraged constituents - Tony Blair and north-east cabinet colleagues, once regular passengers on the east coast line, have clearly had enough. During a live TV session before angry voters this week, the prime minister acknowledged that life indeed is \"absolute hell\" on the railways - and that the crisis is clearly much worse than that portrayed by the hapless Lord Macdonald last week. He might live to regret his comment that the chaos is not a big political issue.</p> <p>It is clearly not getting much better - as my emails from angry travellers testify after first writing about the problems two weeks' ago. Everyone knows that the government will have to act - not merely by asking Railtrack to lift speed restrictions, but also by explaining to voters, how its rail revival package now adds up. Can the operating companies and Railtrack stump up their contribution to a \u00a360bn 10-year plan? Many think this looks increasingly unlikely. Who, then, fills the financial hole left by plummeting rail revenues?</p> <p>Renationalisation of Railtrack might be off the agenda, dismissed as a blast back to those awful old Labour days of state control. But something has to give very soon if the issue is not to haunt Tony Blair before the likely May election.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:peter.hetherington@theguardian.com\">peter.hetherington@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Take heart. Amid the chaos and the queues of despairing families trying vainly to get a seat on ticket-only Christmas services, Britain's rail system - or at least the public face of it - is experiencing substantial investment. That's what Railtrack says, anyway. About 85% of rail services will be back to normal by the end of January, the government also said yesterday. And Mr Prescott added: \"Our job is to get behind Railtrack at the moment,\" as he announced the government's five-year \u00a38.4bn local transport spending plan But the 36,000 passengers travelling daily through Newcastle upon Tyne's magnificent Central Station would have great difficulty matching the awful reality of daily travel with the virtual world of Railtrack as they pass its lavish exhibition, featuring old prints, photographs and the latest audiovisual wizardry. The beleaguered privatised company is celebrating the 150th anniversary of the grade-one listed station, opened by Queen Victoria. In a city where George Stephenson built the first locomotives - and where his engineering son, Robert, built great rail bridges and managed rail infrastructure better than Railtrack - the irony is not lost on the long-suffering passenger, or the unfortunate train crews trying desperately to smile amid disorder. They know that things can only get worse over the next few days. The exhibition speaks much about the priorities of Railtrack in putting station improvements ahead of track renewal until very recently. In glossy leaflets the company talks proudly of spending \u00a326m refurbishing its fine \"cathedral\" designed in classical style by the renowned Newcastle architect, John Dobson. It has incorporated a trendy cafe-bar advertising cut-price liquor and speaks of many retail opportunities underneath the station's towering portico. Exploiting property assets was considered of far more importance than improving the network when Railtrack was given away cheap for \u00a31.8bn during the dying days of the last government. But the east coast operator, GNER, will be running only 60% services - and insisting all travel must be ticket-only - on what was the country's fastest line, between Edinburgh and London, over the seasonal period. Some 180,000 people will have to find alternative transport, although, as the Rail Passengers Council claim, this breaks a fundamental convention of the network - that people should be able to turn up and go. The full horror of travel soon becomes apparent on the 300-mile journey from Newcastle to London. \"Christmas is going to be hell,\" says a restaurant car attendant. \"They're putting us all on barrier duty.\" Scores of staff are being reassigned to keep order. British Transport Police, it is said, have cancelled all leave. It's chaos. Just soak up the spectacle of a 300-mile-long construction site that once passed for Britain's fastest railway. But clearly chaos seems a world away from the air-conditioned calm of Whitehall. It is something for lesser mortals to endure. At around \u00a3140 for a standard return - \u00a3220 if you opt for a little leg room in first class - chaos does not come cheap. On the most expensive system in Europe, there are no concessions, no complimentary refreshments to lubricate the parched tongue on a five-hour (if you're lucky) journey that used to take three. With a Christmas travel crisis approaching, road traffic up by at least 25% and many more domestic aircraft pumping more hydrocarbons into the atmosphere - not to mention daily horror stories from outraged constituents - Tony Blair and north-east cabinet colleagues, once regular passengers on the east coast line, have clearly had enough. During a live TV session before angry voters this week, the prime minister acknowledged that life indeed is \"absolute hell\" on the railways - and that the crisis is clearly much worse than that portrayed by the hapless Lord Macdonald last week. He might live to regret his comment that the chaos is not a big political issue. It is clearly not getting much better - as my emails from angry travellers testify after first writing about the problems two weeks' ago. Everyone knows that the government will have to act - not merely by asking Railtrack to lift speed restrictions, but also by explaining to voters, how its rail revival package now adds up. Can the operating companies and Railtrack stump up their contribution to a \u00a360bn 10-year plan? Many think this looks increasingly unlikely. Who, then, fills the financial hole left by plummeting rail revenues? Renationalisation of Railtrack might be off the agenda, dismissed as a blast back to those awful old Labour days of state control. But something has to give very soon if the issue is not to haunt Tony Blair before the likely May election. peter.hetherington@theguardian.com",

While immune from prosecution as long as he remains in office, if he admits to knowledge of illicit party financing Mr Chirac could be called as a witness - something he wants to avoid ahead of the presidential election in 2002. Magistrates have found evidence to suggest that while Mr Chirac was in charge at Paris city hall, building companies were shaken down for huge sums of money in exchange for contracts to work on council-owned property. Companies were reportedly expected to pay 2% of the value of each contract to the RPR, which kept 1.2% and passed the rest on to be divided between the Socialist and Communist parties.

      "bodyText": "The former prime minister of New Zealand referred to in an article headed Let's abolish this absurdity, page 23, yesterday, was Sir Wallace (Bill) Rowling, rather than Rawling as we had it. Professor Richard Cassily [sic], the operatic tenor, who appeared in yesterday's Birthdays, page 14, in fact died in January 1998. His correct surname was Cassilly. Professor Geoffrey Alderman, the author of an article headed We must try the American way, page 13, Education, December 12, was formerly pro-vice-chancellor of Middlesex University, not vice-chancellor. A (very) belated correction to a statement in an article And now for the forecast, pages 6 and 7, G2, November 6, in which we said it was the astronomer royal, Sir Harold Spencer Jones, who dismissed the idea of space flight as \"bunk\". It was Sir Richard van der Riet Woolley who, as astronomer royal, made that statement, although he said \"bilge\" not \"bunk\". In a column, page 7, Society, December 13, we said: \"In the words of Lord Rothschild, boss of the former think tank, their role is to produce the grit which creates the oyster.\" More valuably, the grit creates the pearl (in some oysters). A mistake crept into the email address of Dr Mike Theis, the writer of a letter published yesterday about the Hastings bypasses.

The figures show that the Metropolitan police has continued to face a severe recruitment problem, having suffering a net loss of 1,253 officers between March and September, but that London's problems are not typical of the rest of the country. The Home Office statistical bulletin also shows that the recruitment of people from ethnic minority communities to the police has begun to increase since the implementation of the Macpherson report on the Stephen Lawrence case. An extra 314 black and Asian officers were recruited between March and September, bringing the total number to 3,070 - a rise of 11%. More than half of them joined the Met. In all, 26 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales have seen their strength increase this year, the 3,271 recruits who joined outnumbering for the first time for several years the 2,884 who retired or resigned. Recruitment has risen sharply this year - the previous six months brought only 2,120 new recruits - as a result of the introduction of a new national crime fighting fund that will finance a further 9,000 recruits over the next three years. The overall strength recorded on September 30 was just seven officers fewer than the figure for March 31. Moreover, it is believed that the number of serving officers, particularly constables, increased further in October and November. The police minister, Charles Clarke, said the figures showed that the fall in police numbers in London was not an indication of what was happening across the country. New London weighting allowances, which increased the starting salary in the capital to \u00a323,000, special housing initiatives, and now talks about providing a free travelcard for every officer were all being used to tackle the problem.",

      "body": "<p>As the political ambitions of the Rev Ndabaningi Sithole, who has died aged 80, failed one by one, he descended irretrievably down the political ladder of Zimbabwe. Yet once he had been at the centre of his homeland's politics. Indeed, he was seen by some as the first black man, in what was then Rhodesia, to express the philosophy underlying the black nationalist cause.</p> <p>In 1960, a year after the publication of his book, African Nationalism, Sithole was invited to join the executive of the National Democratic party, of which he became treasurer. Led by Joshua Nkomo, the NDP was, in Rhodesia, a key sign of the emergence of black nationalism, and, as such, it was subjected to massive attack by the white minority government.</p> <p>In 1963, soon after the NDP turned into the Zimbabwe African People's Union (Zapu), Sithole quit and, backed by the young Robert Mugabe, set up the Zimbabwe African National Union (Zanu), becoming its first president, with Mugabe as secretary-general. Black politics in Rhodesia in the 1960s were an arena of intense internal rivalries and splits over strategy, with major conflicts between Zapu and Zanu. Meanwhile, in April 1964, Ian Smith swept to power, at the head of his extreme-rightwing, white minority government.</p> <p>Zapu and Zanu were banned, and Sithole, among many others, was detained. Four years later, he was to be found fervently supporting the armed struggle, arguing against reconciliation with Smith and urging his assassination. The move got him convicted, in February 1969, on incitement charges.</p> <p>But what followed destroyed Sithole's reputation. In court, after being sentenced, he disassociated himself \"in word, thought or deed from any subversive activities, from any terrorist activities, and from any form of violence\". By 1974, Mugabe had replaced him as Zanu leader.</p> <p>Sithole was born at Nyamandhlovu, north of Bulawayo, in Matabeleland; his mother was Ndebele, his father, a poor builder, of Ndau origins. He saved up for education, which he got in his mid-teens at the Didaya Mission, under headmaster Garfield Todd, who was later to be a liberal prime minister before the final stages of rightwing white rule.</p> <p>In 1939, he obtained a \u00a310 Beit bursary, and took a two-year teaching diploma at the Waddilove Training Institute. He was a teacher for 14 years, instructing first at kraal schools and then at higher institutions. At Tegwani Training Institution in 1948, he took intensive bible studies, becoming a preacher for the (British) Methodist church, before joining, in 1950, the United Methodists, and teaching at Mount Sel-inda American Methodist Mission. While there, he obtained a BA degree by correspondence course.</p> <p>Impressed with their young pupil, in 1955 the mission sent Sithole to the Newton Theological College in Massachusetts. When he returned to Rhodesia in 1958, he was ordained at Mt Selinda congregationalist church and appointed principal of Chikore central primary school.</p> <p>Sithole had begun his political ascent. In 1959, he was asked to address the African Teachers' Association at Fort Victoria, and lobbied so effectively that he was elected president of the group. Then came his book, African Nationalism, and the NDP.</p> <p>But the Rhodesia into which Sithole was released in 1974 after his incitement sentence - he was briefly detained again in 1975 - was very different. The ascent had begun of what became Mugabe's Zanu-Patriotic Front, while Sithole's version of Zanu had withered. In 1978, after three years in Tanzania, Sithole returned to Rhodesia as the struggle for independence and the guerrilla war were reaching their climax.</p> <p>Sithole said he saw Rhodesia as a unique problem, requiring a pragmatic approach, even though some young men might regard him \"as a moderate and a has-been\". The latter he proved himself to be. Smith desperately stitched together an internal settlement, with Bishop Abel Muzorewa, Chief Jeremiah Chirau and Sithole, in an abortive attempt to fend off international pressure. This led to an entity called Zimbawe-Rhodesia and elections in which Sithole's Zanu was defeated by Muzorewa's United African National Council.</p> <p>Then, in 1980, came the Lancaster House deal, independence, and Mugabe's triumph. In the mid-1980s, Sithole went into voluntary exile in the United States, where he worked covertly with the rightwing Heritage Foundation, which also sponsored the Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and the apartheid-backed Renamo movement in Mozambique.</p> <p>In the early 1990s, Sithole returned to Zimbabwe. At the time, Mugabe, in a trial-run for his present frenzied behaviour, ordered the seizure of Sithole's farm, provoking a political explosion. Another kind was to follow. Consumed with his hatred of Mugabe and other Zanu-PF leaders, who despised and undermined him in equal measure, Sithole increasingly lost touch with public opinion. The more he did so, the deeper he dug himself into a hole.</p> <p>In 1995, he was elected to parliament from Chipinge, but was arrested soon afterwards, following a botched and amateurish explosives attempt on a Mugabe motorcade; in 1997, he was jailed for two years. But he never served the sentence - he was too old and sick, he waved away the case as a frame-up, and the authorities anyway regarded him as a spent force.</p> <p>In the long run, it was Mugabe, with his guns and radicalism, who had won the day, while Sithole had just kept taking the wrong turns. Earlier this year, he left Zimbabwe for America to get treatment for diabetes, severe blood pressure, an enlarged heart and a blood clot on a lung.</p> <p>He is survived by his second wife, Vesta. They had four daughters (two deceased) and two sons.</p> <p>\u0095 Ndabaningi Sithole, minister of religion and politician, born July 21 1920; died December 12 2000</p>",

By 1974, Mugabe had replaced him as Zanu leader. Sithole was born at Nyamandhlovu, north of Bulawayo, in Matabeleland; his mother was Ndebele, his father, a poor builder, of Ndau origins. He saved up for education, which he got in his mid-teens at the Didaya Mission, under headmaster Garfield Todd, who was later to be a liberal prime minister before the final stages of rightwing white rule. In 1939, he obtained a \u00a310 Beit bursary, and took a two-year teaching diploma at the Waddilove Training Institute. He was a teacher for 14 years, instructing first at kraal schools and then at higher institutions. At Tegwani Training Institution in 1948, he took intensive bible studies, becoming a preacher for the (British) Methodist church, before joining, in 1950, the United Methodists, and teaching at Mount Sel-inda American Methodist Mission. While there, he obtained a BA degree by correspondence course. Impressed with their young pupil, in 1955 the mission sent Sithole to the Newton Theological College in Massachusetts. When he returned to Rhodesia in 1958, he was ordained at Mt Selinda congregationalist church and appointed principal of Chikore central primary school. Sithole had begun his political ascent. In 1959, he was asked to address the African Teachers' Association at Fort Victoria, and lobbied so effectively that he was elected president of the group. Then came his book, African Nationalism, and the NDP. But the Rhodesia into which Sithole was released in 1974 after his incitement sentence - he was briefly detained again in 1975 - was very different. The ascent had begun of what became Mugabe's Zanu-Patriotic Front, while Sithole's version of Zanu had withered. In 1978, after three years in Tanzania, Sithole returned to Rhodesia as the struggle for independence and the guerrilla war were reaching their climax. Sithole said he saw Rhodesia as a unique problem, requiring a pragmatic approach, even though some young men might regard him \"as a moderate and a has-been\". The latter he proved himself to be. Smith desperately stitched together an internal settlement, with Bishop Abel Muzorewa, Chief Jeremiah Chirau and Sithole, in an abortive attempt to fend off international pressure. This led to an entity called Zimbawe-Rhodesia and elections in which Sithole's Zanu was defeated by Muzorewa's United African National Council. Then, in 1980, came the Lancaster House deal, independence, and Mugabe's triumph. In the mid-1980s, Sithole went into voluntary exile in the United States, where he worked covertly with the rightwing Heritage Foundation, which also sponsored the Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and the apartheid-backed Renamo movement in Mozambique. In the early 1990s, Sithole returned to Zimbabwe. At the time, Mugabe, in a trial-run for his present frenzied behaviour, ordered the seizure of Sithole's farm, provoking a political explosion. Another kind was to follow. Consumed with his hatred of Mugabe and other Zanu-PF leaders, who despised and undermined him in equal measure, Sithole increasingly lost touch with public opinion. The more he did so, the deeper he dug himself into a hole. In 1995, he was elected to parliament from Chipinge, but was arrested soon afterwards, following a botched and amateurish explosives attempt on a Mugabe motorcade; in 1997, he was jailed for two years. But he never served the sentence - he was too old and sick, he waved away the case as a frame-up, and the authorities anyway regarded him as a spent force. In the long run, it was Mugabe, with his guns and radicalism, who had won the day, while Sithole had just kept taking the wrong turns. Earlier this year, he left Zimbabwe for America to get treatment for diabetes, severe blood pressure, an enlarged heart and a blood clot on a lung. He is survived by his second wife, Vesta. They had four daughters (two deceased) and two sons. \u0095 Ndabaningi Sithole, minister of religion and politician, born July 21 1920; died December 12 2000",

It said the Metropolitan police was infected with \"institutional racism\". This it defined as a \"collective failure of an organisation to provide a professional service to people because of their colour, culture or ethnic origin. It can be seen in processes, attitudes and behaviour which amounts to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping which disadvantage minority ethnic people ...We do not accept that a finding of institutional racism means all officers are racist.\" Recommendation 60 of the Macpherson report said powers of stop and search \"should remain unchanged.\" </p> <p>Police numbers have been in decline since 1993 when they peaked at 127,000, long before the publication of the Macpherson report in February 1999. Figures published yesterday show that in most forces numbers have started to rise again. In London, they fell this year by 1,200 but the Police Federation has also cited housing costs, uncompetitive pay and low unemployment as factors. </p> <p> <b> William Hague's claim</b> </p> <p> \"We have had 21 months to assess impact of the Macpherson report. In that period the use of stop and search powers by the Met police has fallen. In February 1999, the Met made 18,752 arrests following stop and searches. In September this year, new provisional figures show that has dropped by a third to just 11,858 arrests.\" </p> <p> <b> Analysis</b> </p> <p> Conservative Central Office was forced to admit last night that William Hague had quoted the wrong figures. The correct figures for the level of arrests are 2,609 in February 1999 and 1,898 in September 2000 - a fall of 711 and not the 7,000 fewer arrests portrayed by the Tory leader. The figures he quoted related to the number of times stop and search powers were used. </p> <p>In addition, the Metropolitan police say the record shows \"improving statistics in relation to stop and search\". In comparing December 1998 to December 1999 they note that the number of searches which were running at 300,000 a year had fallen by 38.23% but the arrest rate had improved from 14% to 16% as the tactic was targeted on those who were acting suspiciously or on the basis of intelligence. The Home Office also says it is not the number of stop and searches that is important but how they are used. The most common reason for arrest after being stopped on the street is that drugs have been found and yet drug offences have fallen in London in the past year. Macpherson did not recommend reducing use of stop and search powers; instead he said in order to combat discrimination against black and Asian people stops should be recorded and a written reason given by the officer. </p> <p> <b> William Hague's claim</b> </p> <p> \"At the same time, street crime has soared - not just in London but around the country. This year's British Crime Survey shows robberies up 14%, muggings up 4% and violence against a stranger up 29%.\" </p> <p> <b> Analysis</b> </p> <p> Paul Wiles, Home Office research director, said yesterday there was no direct link between stop and search and street crime levels. Four studies of stop and search published last month said the evidence was that searches probably detect offenders for only a small proportion of all crimes but they can make a notable contribution to arrests. However, many arrests are for minor offences, such as possession of small amounts of cannabis. The Police Research Group also found that there was a small disruptive effect on criminal activities but little evidence that the practice deterred many criminals. Only one in 10 stops leads to an arrest. </p> <p> <b> William Hague's claim</b> </p> <p> \"The people who are suffering most from the post-Macpherson collapse in police morale and the rise in street crime are members of the ethnic minority communities ... We will expect the police to use rigorously the powers [of stop and search] which they have been given to uphold the law and fight crime ... Political correctness will not be allowed to get in the way of law enforcement ... a disproportionate number of street robberies are committed by young black men, often against other black people, just as street violence and burglary tend to be committed by young white men.\" </p> <p> <b> Analysis</b> </p> <p> Criminal justice statistics repeatedly show that black and Asian communities suffer disproportionately from crime partly because they are concentrated on poor, inner city estates with the highest crime levels. Home Office research also confirms the different patterns of offending among black and white youths, partly due to more black youths being out on the streets. However, the Met police do not believe that stop and search is effective in reducing street robberies; instead they have launched intensive undercover surveillance operations to go after street gangs and muggers. No \"politically correct\" politician or police officer has recommended that stop and search powers should not be used. Indeed, both Tony Blair, Jack Straw, the home secretary, and the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir John Stevens, have urged constables to continue to use such powers. </p> <p> <b> Conclusion</b> </p> <p> William Hague has revived an argument - for the third time in a year - over claims from the Met police federation, the trade union, that the police had \"retreated\" from policing crime at the Notting Hill carnival, because they were under pressure to ignore black crime. Mr Hague's speech is a thinly coded repetition of the message purveyed by the Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail that \"the liberal establishment\" was somehow responsible for allowing black criminals to get away with it. The evidence shows Macpherson did not recommend reduction in the use of stop and search. Its use has fallen sharply but the Met says it is now used in a more targeted way and that surveillance operations are more effective in dealing with street muggings. </p> <p> <b>Useful links</b></p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.blink.org.uk/campaign/stevelaw/slmain.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">The Stephen Lawrence Campaign</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.met.police.uk/\" target=\"_NEW\">Metropolitan Police</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>With only 10 days to go to Christmas, this is the time of year when Britain's retailers normally start to whinge about how tight-fisted consumers are being. Indeed, the pre-Christmas surveys from both the CBI and the British Retail Consortium carried their usual warnings about how the Scrooge-like behaviour of shoppers was threatening their members with penury. </p> <p>Only when the official government figures for retail spending come out does it become apparent that at Christmas we tend to follow the \"spend, spend, spend\" philosophy of Viv Nicholson rather than Charles Dickens' famous character. Each year tends to beat the previous record. </p> <p>Data released by the office for national statistics yesterday confirmed the familiar pattern, with retail sales volumes rising by 0.7% in November, against City expectations of a 0.2% gain. If consumers were keeping their purses closed, there was little evidence in the figures. </p> <p>Nor was November simply a flash in the pan. In the latest three months, retail sales volumes are up 1.4% on the previous quarter and 4.5% ahead of the September to November period of 1999. Michael Saunders, economist at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, said the year-on-year gain was close to the highest of the past decade. </p> <p>What is more, the pick-up in spending was not the result of bargain-hunting shoppers taking advantage of deep discounting by retailers desperate to offload surplus stock.

      "bodyText": "With only 10 days to go to Christmas, this is the time of year when Britain's retailers normally start to whinge about how tight-fisted consumers are being. Indeed, the pre-Christmas surveys from both the CBI and the British Retail Consortium carried their usual warnings about how the Scrooge-like behaviour of shoppers was threatening their members with penury. Only when the official government figures for retail spending come out does it become apparent that at Christmas we tend to follow the \"spend, spend, spend\" philosophy of Viv Nicholson rather than Charles Dickens' famous character. Each year tends to beat the previous record. Data released by the office for national statistics yesterday confirmed the familiar pattern, with retail sales volumes rising by 0.7% in November, against City expectations of a 0.2% gain. If consumers were keeping their purses closed, there was little evidence in the figures. Nor was November simply a flash in the pan. In the latest three months, retail sales volumes are up 1.4% on the previous quarter and 4.5% ahead of the September to November period of 1999. Michael Saunders, economist at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, said the year-on-year gain was close to the highest of the past decade. What is more, the pick-up in spending was not the result of bargain-hunting shoppers taking advantage of deep discounting by retailers desperate to offload surplus stock. This has been the trend over the past 10 years, with consumers and retailers playing a cat-and-mouse game in which every attempt by stores to widen their profit margins is met with a buyers' strike. However, in November prices actually went up slightly and consumers carried on buying. The non-seasonally adjusted deflator - an indication of price changes on the high street - rose slightly to minus 0.3% in November from a revised minus 0.4% in October. Had events followed their normal course, consumers would simply have sat on their hands in November and waited for panic-stricken retailers to bring forward their winter sales to the pre-Christmas period. Although it is notoriously difficult to read the retail sales figures at the turn of the year because of the problems of seasonal adjustment of the raw data, yesterday's figures challenge the view that the economy is heading for a sharp slowdown, which would prompt an early cut in interest rates from the Bank of England.

      "body": "<p>It only lasted a few seconds. But if you didn't have a television, it would have been worth buying one just to see it - the exquisite moment in which Noel Edmonds pooped in his own publicity dog dish, courtesy of Chris Morris and his Brass Eye show. There Noel was, in his own office, warning us of the effects of a made-up drug called cake, claiming that it affects a part of the brain called Shatner's bassoon. Welcome to the TV stitch-up, whose big brother is celebrated tomorrow night in Channel 4's Candid Camera evening. </p> <p>Brass Eye was denounced by some critics as exploitative and sadistic - exactly the reasons why people loved Candid Camera. Since 1960, when Allen Funt, Candid Camera's creator, put his first proverbial banana-skin on the sidewalk of an unsuspecting New York public, we've been hooked. </p> <p>There was a level of ingenuity and absurdity to the stitch-ups on the original show. A woman claims in a job interview that she's always being followed by a lady with a monkey on her head. The doubtful interviewer (the victim) tries tactfully to suggest that she should see someone about it. But when the woman goes out to the toilet and a lady arrives with a live monkey on her head, you can see the interviewer quite seriously questioning his own sanity - and even asking the interviewee which doctor she would go to. </p> <p>The gags were often overly elaborate: a man sneezing down a telephone, while miles away the other caller is mysteriously sprayed by the other handset (taken - albeit disgustedly - as perfectly normal by the caller); diner stools that would suddenly telescope into the ground; cars with no engine, or ones which could split into two, each half going round an incredulous traffic cop; horses and postboxes that talked. Stars regularly helped out too - appearances by a young Woody Allen, Buster Keaton and Muhammad Ali. </p> <p>These days, the popular television channels are stuffed with the cousins of the original Candid Camera. \"Real\" stuff like Police, Camera, Action where you can watch bank-robbers driving rather badly through fields. Or that ratings-rich area of programming where reality TV meets DIY stitch-up TV, scooping up everything from Blind Date to Big Brother. And one of the keys to the success of these shows - in this country, anyway - is that we know it'll all be OK in the end.

      "bodyText": "It only lasted a few seconds. But if you didn't have a television, it would have been worth buying one just to see it - the exquisite moment in which Noel Edmonds pooped in his own publicity dog dish, courtesy of Chris Morris and his Brass Eye show. There Noel was, in his own office, warning us of the effects of a made-up drug called cake, claiming that it affects a part of the brain called Shatner's bassoon. Welcome to the TV stitch-up, whose big brother is celebrated tomorrow night in Channel 4's Candid Camera evening. Brass Eye was denounced by some critics as exploitative and sadistic - exactly the reasons why people loved Candid Camera. Since 1960, when Allen Funt, Candid Camera's creator, put his first proverbial banana-skin on the sidewalk of an unsuspecting New York public, we've been hooked. There was a level of ingenuity and absurdity to the stitch-ups on the original show. A woman claims in a job interview that she's always being followed by a lady with a monkey on her head. The doubtful interviewer (the victim) tries tactfully to suggest that she should see someone about it. But when the woman goes out to the toilet and a lady arrives with a live monkey on her head, you can see the interviewer quite seriously questioning his own sanity - and even asking the interviewee which doctor she would go to. The gags were often overly elaborate: a man sneezing down a telephone, while miles away the other caller is mysteriously sprayed by the other handset (taken - albeit disgustedly - as perfectly normal by the caller); diner stools that would suddenly telescope into the ground; cars with no engine, or ones which could split into two, each half going round an incredulous traffic cop; horses and postboxes that talked. Stars regularly helped out too - appearances by a young Woody Allen, Buster Keaton and Muhammad Ali. These days, the popular television channels are stuffed with the cousins of the original Candid Camera. \"Real\" stuff like Police, Camera, Action where you can watch bank-robbers driving rather badly through fields. Or that ratings-rich area of programming where reality TV meets DIY stitch-up TV, scooping up everything from Blind Date to Big Brother. And one of the keys to the success of these shows - in this country, anyway - is that we know it'll all be OK in the end. When the family cat shuts itself in the microwave on You've Been Framed (and, more worryingly, dad is filming it), we're safe in the knowledge that the pet didn't boil in the bag and eventually emerged unscathed. Examples from Candid Camera's international versions, however, reveal how the shock effects of TV framing have had to be cranked up.

Recipes are supplied by cooks from all over the world - eg, Jennifer Bopp's au gratin potatoes, bless her cotton socks. Elsewhere, there's Darlene Coleman's ornament dough, and recipes for stollen, panettone and cranberry swirl coffee cake. Pros: There are even recipes for the vegetarian Christmas - tofu turkey - which \"Becky\" says is \"so darn clever and tasty\". Thanks, Becky, for that one. Cons: With instructions for making Aunt Phyllis's magnificent cheese ball, christmasrecipes.com is sometimes a little hard to take seriously.",

Security sources said it was probably intended as an under-car booby trap, to kill a particular individual rather than for a large scale attack.</p> <p>The RUC, acting on intelligence, swooped on a car which they believe had been driven from west Belfast, and detectives were last night questioning two suspects, aged 16 and 21, at Gough barracks, Armagh.</p> <p>The previous night, President Clinton, speaking in the city's \u00a393m Odyssey arena, had pledged utmost co-operation with British and Irish authorities to root out terrorists opposed to the Good Friday agreement.</p> <p>The RUC chief constable, Sir Ronnie Flanagan, and the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, had earlier warned of the danger of dissident violence, both in Northern Ireland and in mainland Britain.</p> <p>Police fear the device could have been aimed at a loyalist or Protestant target, in an attempt to escalate sectarian attacks. A Protestant taxi driver, Trevor Kell, and a Catholic workman, Gary Moore, were shot dead last week.</p> <p>Another murder the day after President Clinton's high profile farewell visit would have been assured maximum publicity.</p> <p>Sinn Fein wants the government to scale down security, particularly in the republican heartland of South Armagh. This is one of the disputes stalling the peace process, along with nationalists' call for the full implementation of the Patten policing reforms. Yesterday's find will add weight to the unionist argument that the dissident threat remains too great to contemplate further demilitarisation.</p> <p>Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist party's spokesman on security, said: \"The greatest injustice to society as a whole is that Patten has failed to take into consideration the levels of criminality and terrorism, and the changes are being made in a virtual vacuum.\"</p> <p>Les Rodgers, chairman of the Police Federation, which represents most of the RUC's 13,000 officers, was furious that his members were not told details of the plan to implement recommendations in the police bill before they leaked to the media.</p> <p>The plan sets out a recommended timetable for change, including merging special branch and CID by April, shutting the Gough interrogation centre by autumn, and phasing out the full time reserve force by early 2002.</p> <p>\"This bomb doesn't augur well,\" said Mr Rodgers. \"We need officers on the ground.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Mr Mandelson is to challenge a decision to free the loyalist leader Johnny Adair, who was re-imprisoned five months ago because of his alleged influence on an internecine feud which has claimed seven lives since.</p> <p>The sentence review commission, set up under the Good Friday agreement to rule on the early release of paramilitary prisoners, issued a preliminary finding that the Ulster Freedom Fighter leader should be allowed out of jail.</p> <p>Lawyers for the prison service are to contest this. Adair's counsel will put his case at a hearing at Maghaberry prison, Co Antrim, where he is held.</p> <p>The Ulster Democratic party chairman, John White, a close friend of Adair's, insisted the UFF leader is now a firm supporter of the peace process.</p>",

Security sources said it was probably intended as an under-car booby trap, to kill a particular individual rather than for a large scale attack. The RUC, acting on intelligence, swooped on a car which they believe had been driven from west Belfast, and detectives were last night questioning two suspects, aged 16 and 21, at Gough barracks, Armagh. The previous night, President Clinton, speaking in the city's \u00a393m Odyssey arena, had pledged utmost co-operation with British and Irish authorities to root out terrorists opposed to the Good Friday agreement. The RUC chief constable, Sir Ronnie Flanagan, and the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, had earlier warned of the danger of dissident violence, both in Northern Ireland and in mainland Britain. Police fear the device could have been aimed at a loyalist or Protestant target, in an attempt to escalate sectarian attacks. A Protestant taxi driver, Trevor Kell, and a Catholic workman, Gary Moore, were shot dead last week. Another murder the day after President Clinton's high profile farewell visit would have been assured maximum publicity. Sinn Fein wants the government to scale down security, particularly in the republican heartland of South Armagh. This is one of the disputes stalling the peace process, along with nationalists' call for the full implementation of the Patten policing reforms. Yesterday's find will add weight to the unionist argument that the dissident threat remains too great to contemplate further demilitarisation. Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist party's spokesman on security, said: \"The greatest injustice to society as a whole is that Patten has failed to take into consideration the levels of criminality and terrorism, and the changes are being made in a virtual vacuum.\" Les Rodgers, chairman of the Police Federation, which represents most of the RUC's 13,000 officers, was furious that his members were not told details of the plan to implement recommendations in the police bill before they leaked to the media. The plan sets out a recommended timetable for change, including merging special branch and CID by April, shutting the Gough interrogation centre by autumn, and phasing out the full time reserve force by early 2002. \"This bomb doesn't augur well,\" said Mr Rodgers. \"We need officers on the ground.\" \u0095 Mr Mandelson is to challenge a decision to free the loyalist leader Johnny Adair, who was re-imprisoned five months ago because of his alleged influence on an internecine feud which has claimed seven lives since. The sentence review commission, set up under the Good Friday agreement to rule on the early release of paramilitary prisoners, issued a preliminary finding that the Ulster Freedom Fighter leader should be allowed out of jail. Lawyers for the prison service are to contest this. Adair's counsel will put his case at a hearing at Maghaberry prison, Co Antrim, where he is held. The Ulster Democratic party chairman, John White, a close friend of Adair's, insisted the UFF leader is now a firm supporter of the peace process.",

      "body": "<p>In a pub on a Liverpool housing estate, a crowd of extras dressed as Manchester United supporters are trying their best to look aggressive. \"For fuck's sake, not you again,\" a man repeats, rehearsing his inflection. Production hands dither round him muttering \"Ugly ones to the back, please\" and a small explosion goes off in the corner. The man's friend, who does not have a speaking role, snorts loudly between takes and points out that it's only a masochistic Man U supporter who would talk with a Liverpool accent. When they duck outside for a fag, they pull coats over their football shirts and boast of how they'd burn them - if wardrobe didn't impose fines for that kind of insubordination. </p> <p>Here on the set of The 51st State - a film that pitches Samuel L Jackson in wacky juxtaposition with Ricky Tomlinson, Robert Carlyle, Sean Pertwee and Michael Starke (Sinbad off Brookside) - producers are happy to tolerate a little regional inaccuracy for the charms of shooting in a city where driving across town takes 15 minutes and, until recently, you could always get a parking space. The film, written by first-time screenwriter Stel Pavlou while he was working in Threshers off licence, is a black comedy in which Jackson plays an American chemist who concocts a super-drug and goes to Liverpool to flog it. There, he hooks up with Robert Carlyle, an American-loathing local, and together they take on Ricky Tomlinson, a sloppy, small-time drug dealer. The city council is pleased to observe that the film makes great use of the Liverpool skyline and is part of a mini-renaissance that has made it impossible to get a hotel room in the city for the best part of three months. </p> <p>Since September, five feature films have been shot in Liverpool: My Kingdom, a movie made for Sky starring Richard Harris and Lynn Redgrave; Parole Officer, written by and starring Steve Coogan in surreal partnership with Omar Sharif; In His Life, a John Lennon biopic for the American network NBC; a shoot 'em up called Al's Lads, and The 51st State, the biggest of the lot. Add to this Liam, a slice of social realism written by Jimmy McGovern and directed by Stephen Frears, and recently released Brit-gangster thriller Going Off Big Time, and you can see why the Liverpool Film Office has launched a snazzy website and declared the boom officially in session. </p> <p>\"It's just like being in LA,\" says Peter Barnes, producer of Al's Lads, which chronicles the fortunes of three Liverpool waiters on the Mauretania who jump overboard and swim to the American coast, finally pitching up in Chicago and stumbling across the city's gangsters. \"Every time you went round a corner, there was another film crew. At one point, we were in the same building as My Kingdom and The 51st State. We had to compare schedules to insure against collisions.\" </p> <p>\"Can you imagine anything better?\" says Michael Starke, in his trailer on the set of The 51st State, in which he plays a policeman. \"Driving to work every day from my home in Liverpool and finding myself on a Hollywood production with Samuel L Jackson...\" </p> <p>Liverpool's suitability as a film location is partly down to its acres of dilapidated factory space (or \"bomb sites\" as producers call them) which can be dressed up to look like any number of pre-war inner cities. Al's Lads, for example, is set in 1927 Chicago - the Al in the title refers to Al Capone - which, say producers, would have been almost impossible to shoot in the redeveloped centre of modern day Chicago. Liverpool on the other hand, is passably unreconstructed and has that distressed look beloved of directors in search of urban grit. </p> <p>\"We needed warehouses for illegal fight halls,\" says Peter Barnes who lives in the Wirral and for the first time in his career has been able to commute to work. \"We needed speakeasies, we needed prohibition era nightclubs. And in Liverpool we could get access to all of them without being crippled by costs. Liverpool looks more like 1927 Chicago than Chicago does.\" </p> <p>Barnes and his fellow producers estimate that production costs are cut by up to 25% by filming somewhere like Liverpool; more scenes can be shot in a single day when the traffic between locations doesn't hold up half the production. The only downside, says Ronny Yu, the director of The 51st State and who also directed Bride of Chucky, is the bloody awful weather. \"I would come back to Liverpool in an instant, but only if I could shoot entirely indoors,\" he says. \"I have had to totally redo scenes because it is blue sky one moment and hurling it down the next.\" He calls action on a stunt in which Ricky Tomlinson is suspended beneath a 22-tonne crate, before observing, apparently at random, that \"the men in Liverpool are all really ugly, but the women are beautiful. Why is that?\" </p> <p>\"It's that whole British standing in the rain experience,\" says Peter Barnes of filming in Liverpool. \"There has been a run on trailers and we had a couple of prices that suddenly got hyped - local businesses are catching on - but other than that it's been a joy filming here.\" </p> <p>The idea of precious Hollywood film units roughing it in Merseyside has been widely enjoyed by locals. \"This is a tough town,\" marvels Andras Hamori, producer of The 51st State - who is more accustomed to filming in LA. \"The women here are very hard, very tough. You come to the city only knowing it for the Beatles and Liverpool football club, and you find something else altogether. You can tell that it's a town that has suffered a lot.\" </p> <p>While most locals have welcomed the crews with open arms - there are Liverpudlian extras who haven't had a day off in three months and the local economy has had a cash injection that the Film Office estimates to be running into millions - there have been some uneasy moments of culture clash. </p> <p>\"It's a question of how you approach things,\" says a security manager affectionately known as Keith the Thief, who worked on In the Name of the Father and is currently engaged on The 51st State. When the crew was filming on a closed stretch of motorway outside Manchester, a large gang of youths gathered and threatened a set invasion. A rock went through one of the unit's buses, before order was reimposed. \"If it had come to a fight, we would have been battered,\" says Keith enthusiastically. \"If you swagger into a deprived area acting like a big shot, you will get a lot of resentment. But I invited the kids on set and got them all autographs. They were waving at us when the bus pulled out.\" </p> <p>Ricky Tomlinson's only condition of participating in the boom is that the foreign crews make an effort to hire local people. \"I've always said that studios who film in Liverpool are like seagulls,\" he says, in the minutes before filming his stunt. \"They fly in, shit all over you, and fly out again. None of this is any good unless it helps the people of Liverpool.\" </p> <p>Locals aren't easily impressed in this part of the world and the Hollywood invasion has gone largely unremarked. Keith the Thief is fond of relating how Emma Thompson used to walk unmolested between her hotel, the In the Name of the Father set and Marks &amp; Spencer. Michael Owen is one of the very few celebrities who can attract a crowd; everyone else is treated unceremoniously. Samuel L Jackson has earned respect, though. \"Sam's the man,\" say extras repeatedly. \"We've seen him bowling in town. He'll have a beer with the fellas.\" </p> <p>Michael Starke stored up all his bravado and, approaching Jackson on set one day, asked if he would do him a favour and ring Louis Emerick, Starke's fellow actor who plays Mick on Brookside and is a big Jackson fan. Jackson obliged and left a \"Yo, man\" message on the answer machine. It is still being talked about on the Close. </p> <p>The countervailing experience is that of the American crews, and their wonderment in observing ordinary life in Liverpool. One scene in The 51st State was filmed with 500 extras on the terraces at Anfield, in which they all sang You'll Never Walk Alone, and its rival terrace song Glory, Glory Man United. \"I have never seen grown men spontaneously sing like that,\" marvelled one American producer. \"I mean, they knew all the words. In America, you might get cheering at a hockey game, but singing? No way.\" </p> <p>And so the two worlds of Liverpool and Hollywood have established an easy, if bizarre, co-existence.</p>",

      "byline": "Andrew Pulver",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In the 1960s, a bunch of Hollywooders smoked and drank and canoodled their off-screen lives into public attention. They were the Rat Pack. Two decades later, things had changed. After the Summer of Love and the punk upheaval, the movie audience's social demographic had jolted downwards by a similar 20 years or so. As the 1980s dawned there were teens running around all over the planet with hard currency in their pocket and not a whole lot - cinematically speaking - to spend it on. Enter the Brat Pack. </p> <p>From the outside, they looked like a group as internally coherent as the Rats - incestuous, vain, hedonist and spoilt beyond belief. A goodly proportion of them enjoyed a head start in the movie business, being the sons and daughters of powerful Hollywood figures. Others infiltrated the scene via television shows and working the audition circuit. The Brat Pack weren't the best actors of their generation, nor did they make the best movies, but in some indefinable way they distilled the spirit of their age, and earned an ambiguous, collective place in the hearts of the hormone-racked adolescents who voraciously sucked down one movie after another. </p> <p>From our 21st century vantage point a decade and a half later, even the most enduring Brat Pack products seem clumsily scripted and ineptly put together - much like the music videos of similar vintage - but it's impossible to overestimate the emotional charge that much of their work carried for the serried ranks of teenagers who saw themselves, heightened and idealised maybe, flashing across the screen. </p> <p>The Brat Pack movies told all kinds of stories, some of them simple, some of them ridiculous, some moving, some nausea-inducing. Not all of them were teen movies, for as the Pack got older, so did their movies, and had them tickling around the issues that beset young adults. Not every teen movie was a Brat Pack movie; there were stars and talents working outside the gilded sphere of privilege who made their own contribution to a fondly remembered genre. Still, teen tales of resentment, self- loathing and wide-eyed gratification form the staple of the Brat Pack oeuvre, and, although the combination always changed, they were all linked by the unrelenting gang-mentality arrogance that the Brats brought with them. </p> <p>The intervening years have only added to the Brat Pack's lustre. The kids who slavishly watched the movies - say you were 15 in 1983 - grew up into the world-weary, ultra-knowing Generation X, a do-nothing generation that cherished and treasured its own formative experiences with a fervour and self-regard that's become almost embarrassing. And where did this self-regard come from? The Brats themselves set the example, feeding and inspiring as many teen demons as they appeared to exorcise. Appropriately enough, the Brat Pack have all gone their separate ways: some have become huge stars, others workaday actors; yet others are nursing career revivals and negotiating parole conditions. But once upon a time, they were all revelling in the limitless possibilities and awesome potential that lay ahead. </p> <p>The high point of the Brat Pack was the summer of 1985. The Breakfast Club was out, and St Elmo's Fire in the can. New York magazine, that June, ran a story identifying for the first time the existence of a new generation of Hollywood players. Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson and Emilio Estevez graced the cover, radiating whatever energy it took to par-tay all night. Writer David Blum characterised the threesome living life to the limit at LA's Hard Rock Caf\u00e9. With benefit of hindsight, some of Blum's assertions make interesting reading. He describes Emilio Estevez as the Brat Pack's unofficial president. He assures readers that Estevez's career as a major writer-director is only a matter of time. Molly Ringwald doesn't get a single mention. Harry Dean Stanton is name-checked as the Brat Pack's spiritual father. And, according to Blum, the movie that changed Hollywood, that brought the Brat Pack together... is Taps. </p> <p>Now that the heyday of the Brat Pack is past, some readjustment is in order. First off: who, precisely, are the Brat Pack? Most would agree that Estevez, Ringwald, Lowe and Nelson exemplify the Brat Pack, but what defines their membership? And what about awesomely Bratty talents like Sean Penn, who by and large swerved by the teen movie cycle that is somehow central to the Brat Pack oeuvre? </p> <p>As is the way of history, it takes time for coincidence to become a phenomenon. The heart and soul of the Brat Pack, in retrospect, were a gang of nine: the principal casts of two movies, The Breakfast Club and St Elmo's Fire, both released in 1985. Emilio Estevez, Andrew McCarthy, Robert Hepler Lowe, Demetria Gene Guynes (we know her better as Demi Moore, the surname taken from her first husband Freddie), Judd Nelson, Mary Megan Winningham, Molly Ringwald, Michael Anthony Hall (he swapped his first two names) and Alexandra Elizabeth Sheedy. </p> <p>What's become apparent, years later, is that appreciation of the 80s teen movies reflects that of the teens themselves - grown-ups just didn't understand them. But why did this outpouring of emotion wait until the 1980s to well up and explode, like a pustule on an adolescent nose? Teens had been around, as a socially and economically identifiable force, since the 1950s. They had their own icons in James Dean and Marlon Brando, Tuesday Weld and Natalie Wood. And they had their own movies: from The Wild One and Rebel Without a Cause in the mid-1950s to Beach Blanket Bingo and Muscle Beach Party in the mid-1960s, teens could thrill to the alternate impulses of sassing the old-timers and oiling their glistening pecs in the surf. </p> <p>Ironically, when all this came to an end in the late 1960s as the Hollywood new wave rushed the gates of the palace, it signalled an end to what few reasons there might have been for the curious teen to haunt the movie theatre. Although undeniably Hollywood's 70s generation initiated a golden age, they did it by making adult films. And not pornography either, although to audiences of the time there was occasional confusion. The era that brought us MASH, The Godfather and Bonnie and Clyde also spawned Deep Throat, The Story of O and Emmanuelle. But the golden age of the movie brats couldn't last. How could it? They didn't make movies for teens. </p> <p>Those who did - George Lucas and Steven Spielberg - changed the face of the industry yet again in the mid-1970s. Jaws and Star Wars hauled in the kind of young audiences who were largely alienated by the Movie Brats' later efforts, and Hollywood faced the tough truth that artistic fertility had coincided with economic downturn. It emerged from the 1970s knowing that teens were at least part of the answer to its problems. Years before Star Wars, however, George Lucas had pointed the way. If ever a film-maker had his finger on the pulse, it was Lucas. His second feature, American Graffiti, released in 1973 was a bittersweet memoir of his own high-school days in Modesto 10 years earlier. The big thing, though, about American Graffiti was it took $115m, on an investment of $750,000. One sweet deal. Then followed low-spend, high-yield teen movies ranging from National Lampoon's Animal House to Porky's and Halloween. </p> <p>The first unarguable Brat Pack movie arrived in 1983, when Francis Ford Coppola corralled a bunch of the brightest young actors for his answer to American Graffiti. The Outsiders was another 60s-set tale of youth rebellion, and through its offices Rob Lowe, Tom Cruise, Emilio Estevez and C Thomas Howell all forced their way onto the Hollywood map. The Outsiders acted as the high point of a family tree, with its participants going on to make a flood of often-successful movies in each others' company over the next five years. The 1985 high point came when two ensemble movies, The Breakfast Club and St Elmo's Fire, were released within months of each other, sharing cast members and a similar confidence in their distillation of the teen experience. The penny dropped; the label stuck. By 1988, the Brat Pack cycle was pretty much over: the key Brats had gone their separate ways. In the eternally 1980s way, no one actually wanted to be identified with the label that made them famous. </p> <p> All these movies share a central factor: an unashamed and unaffected deployment of archetypes. The poster for The Breakfast Club shoved it right up front, enumerating its principals as \"a brain, a beauty, a jock, a rebel, and a recluse\". In their unswerving recycling of these basic units, teen movies often resemble the classic structure of fairy tales, or primitive mythology. Ugly ducklings are everywhere, menacing ogres are there to be repulsed (as often by a shower of vomit as anything else). But teen movies are also instinctively sociological: located in strictly defined and controlled communities, at their best they offer a compelling and subtle analysis of a bewildering social network with a pecking order of its own. Teens make the perfect models for this: old enough to recognise and filter social hierarchies, yet too young to rise above it. </p> <p>It was in this framework that the Brat Pack were to make their movies: an unlikely conjunction of the rankest exploitation and most tremulous of emotions. Uniquely among cinematic genres, the teen movie could veer from the most leering bra-tearing eyeful to the most sickening of humiliations - often in the very next shot. The best of the teen movies possess a kind of freewheeling insanity that is as turbulent as its central characters' hormones. The 70s auteurs, who were blown out of the water by Hollywood's commercial revival in the latter half of the decade, may not have approved of what came after them, but in engineering the collapse of the old studio system they broke open Hollywood's floodgates for a kind of continuous revolution, a never-ending panic that ensured that the teen movie could expend all its anarchic energy.

      "bodyText": "In the 1960s, a bunch of Hollywooders smoked and drank and canoodled their off-screen lives into public attention. They were the Rat Pack. Two decades later, things had changed. After the Summer of Love and the punk upheaval, the movie audience's social demographic had jolted downwards by a similar 20 years or so. As the 1980s dawned there were teens running around all over the planet with hard currency in their pocket and not a whole lot - cinematically speaking - to spend it on. Enter the Brat Pack. From the outside, they looked like a group as internally coherent as the Rats - incestuous, vain, hedonist and spoilt beyond belief. A goodly proportion of them enjoyed a head start in the movie business, being the sons and daughters of powerful Hollywood figures. Others infiltrated the scene via television shows and working the audition circuit. The Brat Pack weren't the best actors of their generation, nor did they make the best movies, but in some indefinable way they distilled the spirit of their age, and earned an ambiguous, collective place in the hearts of the hormone-racked adolescents who voraciously sucked down one movie after another. From our 21st century vantage point a decade and a half later, even the most enduring Brat Pack products seem clumsily scripted and ineptly put together - much like the music videos of similar vintage - but it's impossible to overestimate the emotional charge that much of their work carried for the serried ranks of teenagers who saw themselves, heightened and idealised maybe, flashing across the screen. The Brat Pack movies told all kinds of stories, some of them simple, some of them ridiculous, some moving, some nausea-inducing. Not all of them were teen movies, for as the Pack got older, so did their movies, and had them tickling around the issues that beset young adults. Not every teen movie was a Brat Pack movie; there were stars and talents working outside the gilded sphere of privilege who made their own contribution to a fondly remembered genre. Still, teen tales of resentment, self- loathing and wide-eyed gratification form the staple of the Brat Pack oeuvre, and, although the combination always changed, they were all linked by the unrelenting gang-mentality arrogance that the Brats brought with them. The intervening years have only added to the Brat Pack's lustre. The kids who slavishly watched the movies - say you were 15 in 1983 - grew up into the world-weary, ultra-knowing Generation X, a do-nothing generation that cherished and treasured its own formative experiences with a fervour and self-regard that's become almost embarrassing. And where did this self-regard come from? The Brats themselves set the example, feeding and inspiring as many teen demons as they appeared to exorcise. Appropriately enough, the Brat Pack have all gone their separate ways: some have become huge stars, others workaday actors; yet others are nursing career revivals and negotiating parole conditions. But once upon a time, they were all revelling in the limitless possibilities and awesome potential that lay ahead. The high point of the Brat Pack was the summer of 1985. The Breakfast Club was out, and St Elmo's Fire in the can. New York magazine, that June, ran a story identifying for the first time the existence of a new generation of Hollywood players. Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson and Emilio Estevez graced the cover, radiating whatever energy it took to par-tay all night. Writer David Blum characterised the threesome living life to the limit at LA's Hard Rock Caf\u00e9. With benefit of hindsight, some of Blum's assertions make interesting reading. He describes Emilio Estevez as the Brat Pack's unofficial president. He assures readers that Estevez's career as a major writer-director is only a matter of time. Molly Ringwald doesn't get a single mention. Harry Dean Stanton is name-checked as the Brat Pack's spiritual father. And, according to Blum, the movie that changed Hollywood, that brought the Brat Pack together... is Taps. Now that the heyday of the Brat Pack is past, some readjustment is in order. First off: who, precisely, are the Brat Pack? Most would agree that Estevez, Ringwald, Lowe and Nelson exemplify the Brat Pack, but what defines their membership? And what about awesomely Bratty talents like Sean Penn, who by and large swerved by the teen movie cycle that is somehow central to the Brat Pack oeuvre?

      "body": "<p>Year's end approaches and with it the avalanche of Ten Best Lists. Every year I get about five magazines calling me for these. It's nice to be asked, but nothing doing. Instead, here's an unscientific, bigoted, contradictory, illogical, and dyspeptic rundown of (nine) American media products, people and phenomena that particularly annoyed me this year; and, below, an unscientific, bigoted, contradictory, illogical and dyspeptic rundown of the stuff that didn't. </p> <p> <strong> 1. Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Affleck</strong><br> </p> <p> Boy, it's a crowded field but my b\u00e9tes noires of 2000 handily fought off challenges from the likes of rinky-dink Meg Ryan, box office idiot savant Adam Sandler, Madonna (well, at least she's out of my neighbourhood) and mockney-nob Guy Ritchie, Judge Katherine Smith, Lynne Cheney, and dependably tiresome but inactive hardy perennials like Henry Jaglom, Hal Hartley and David Lynch. My nightmare scenario was fulfilled by Bounce, which teamed our two winners in a winningly emetic combination. That dog at the gates of Hell has two heads, not three. </p> <p> <strong> 2. Reality TV</strong><br> </p> <p> We've had docu-soaps, reality TV and doctored documentaries with plot points and story arcs concocted by committee. We had Survivor USA, Big Brother USA, The 1901 House, The Frontier Show (manufactured misery, 1880s style). And Fox TV, which brought us Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire? (who'll probably knock you about), will soon bring us Temptation Island, in which four couples preparing to commit to long-term relationships spend a month on an island teeming with horny singles who'll try to seduce them asunder. Cap'n Jerry Springer is truly at the helm of the Good Ship Disinfotainment. </p> <p> <strong> 3. The electoral quagmire</strong> <br> </p> <p> The farce itself is no bad thing. It's at least demonstrating to Americans how politically polarised their country is and that every level of the allegedly august and impartial judiciary is in the grip, or the gift, of self-serving ideological placemen. But the media coverage has been disgraceful - from Fox TV's decision to call Bush the winner (one of his cousins, a Fox consultant, saw to that) to the feeding frenzy that now greets the merest press release. And poor Dubya Bush looks deeply unhappy about being the likely victor. Little wonder: to quote Texas political commentator Molly Ivins, if you put that boy's brain in a bumblebee, it'd fly backwards. </p> <p> <strong> 4. Battlefield Earth</strong> <br></p> <p> Barking, leg-lifting dog (or runt) of the year - nothing else even came close. But every reverse for the Church of Scientology is one more victory for us \"normals\". Thus it was nice to see the man the public associates most closely with the group, John Travolta, fall flat on his well-fed backside in this tedious and inept, insanely expensive pseudo-epic. But guess what - the sequel's already in the pipeline. People of Earth! Before it arrives, we must devise and construct super-rockets and motherships, abandon our planet to the pod-people of Chairman Ron and immediately colonise Saturn. </p> <p> <strong> 5. The action movie genre</strong> <br> </p> <p> Gone in 60 Seconds? My toilet flushes faster than that - and it's much more fun to watch. The Art of War? The Arse of Bore, more like. And what do you mean, a Get Carter remake? Get away from the Get Carter remake is much sounder advice. The spent and exhausted genre produced two semi-flaccid successes this year: John Woo's Mission: Impossible 2 (a journeyman outing for the master) and the cute but stupid Charlie's Angels. It seems that, apart from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, action movies have few surprises left for us. Time to kickstart the abattoir! </p> <p> <strong> 6. Happy endings</strong> <br></p> <p> An evergreen bugbear. Families are reunited, misery is headed off at the pass, true love prevails, the guy gets the gal, the villain is mailed back to his mum in 20 separate marmalade jars and everybody rides off into a glorious sunset. Raise your snout to the breeze and you can detect the familiar stench of freshly laid Hollywood horseshit. I realise we go to the movies to seek release from our daily dread, but the tyranny of the happy ending is now as bad as Stalin's dictates on Socialist Realism. Surprise me! Kill the good guy for a change. </p> <p> <strong> 7. The following words...</strong> <br></p> <p> \"A masterpiece!\" \"Jaw-droppingly awesome!\" \"A roller-coaster ride from start to finish!\" \"An adrenaline-pumping, heart-stopping adventure!\" \"The most fun I've had at the movies this season!\" \"Strap yourself in and hold on tight!\" \"Two thumbs up!\" \"It's indelibly etched in your memory!\" \"Wow! A film that will knock your socks off!\" \"[Insert stars' names here] give standout performances sure to be remembered at Oscar time!\" \"Thrilling!\" \"It's top-tier movie escapism!\" \"Smart, sophisticated and sexy! The chemistry between the stars literally explodes!\" </p> <p> <strong> 8 ...and the fools who write them</strong> <br></p> <p> Which is to say film critics, among whom I must include (and therefore indict) myself. I've used the word masterpiece a few times myself, which I think is actually worse and more dishonest than most of the hyperbolic tripe quoted above (most of which was probably purchased from or blackmailed out of critics by studio PR flacks, and all of which comes verbatim from one week's worth of press movie ads). As a breed we critics have collectively lowered our quality thresholds to ensure that we can deal with at least some of the trash that washes up in our multiplexes on a Friday. And thanks to the wonderful innovation that scientists call the Quote-Whore, we know that the threshold may yet descend through the floor and into the sewer. </p> <p> <strong> 9. Ten best lists</strong> <br></p> <p> Because I can't think of even five movies released last year that I'd pay to see again, not even on video. Because lists are a form of sexual sublimation and ego-food for Hornby-esque sadsack losers without dates. </p> <p><strong>The good stuff</strong><br></p> <p> <strong> 1. Robert Downey, Jr </strong><br></p> <p> The most gifted actor of his generation (etc - but it is true), Downey has become both a poster child for pharmacological overkill and the most visible martyr of America's dementedly misguided War on Drugs. How could a troubled and fragile thespian genius be so persecuted? OJ Simpson is still walking the streets and Downey may be going back to jail. </p> <p><strong> 2. Russell Crowe </strong><br></p> <p> We already knew from The Insider that Crowe was a fine, subtle, vanity-free actor, happy to ruin his looks to play pudgy and useless. But Gladiator and Proof of Life prove that he's also a great movie star. One is not the same as the other, and the two rarely combine in one actor. Crowe is as manly as Connery and as subtle as Robert Ryan. Pity he sounds like such a prick in real life. </p> <p><strong> 3. The Daily Show with Jon Stewart </strong><br></p> <p> The funniest show on US television - a combination of spoof CNN and spoof Letterman, The Daily Show delivers fake news that eviscerates the real news. Jon Stewart for president! </p> <p><strong> 4. Mainly About Lindsay Anderson </strong><br></p> <p> Gavin Lambert's affectionate biography - an account of Anderson's depressingly attenuated career - is one of the best movie memoirs ever. Anderson's chosen gravestone epitaph: \"Surrounded by fucking idiots.\" </p> <p><strong> 5. The coming strikes </strong><br></p> <p> I don't want to see jobbing actors starve, but I have an idle reverie about the benefits of an extended writers' and directors' strike next year. The strike lasts forever, and the new studio material dries up. Exhibitors fall back on foreign and independent films to fill schedules. Surprisingly, movies starring nobodies do astonishingly well. Armed with this knowledge, studios and producers abandon the grim mathematics of $20m stars and their vain and baleful influence. The strike ends, the small fry happily resume their careers and the marquee-value morons find themselves stranded on high, arid ground, like dinosaurs ripe for extinction. Bring it on!</p>",

The following words... \"A masterpiece!\" \"Jaw-droppingly awesome!\" \"A roller-coaster ride from start to finish!\" \"An adrenaline-pumping, heart-stopping adventure!\" \"The most fun I've had at the movies this season!\" \"Strap yourself in and hold on tight!\" \"Two thumbs up!\" \"It's indelibly etched in your memory!\" \"Wow! A film that will knock your socks off!\" \"[Insert stars' names here] give standout performances sure to be remembered at Oscar time!\" \"Thrilling!\" \"It's top-tier movie escapism!\" \"Smart, sophisticated and sexy! The chemistry between the stars literally explodes!\" 8 ...and the fools who write them Which is to say film critics, among whom I must include (and therefore indict) myself. I've used the word masterpiece a few times myself, which I think is actually worse and more dishonest than most of the hyperbolic tripe quoted above (most of which was probably purchased from or blackmailed out of critics by studio PR flacks, and all of which comes verbatim from one week's worth of press movie ads). As a breed we critics have collectively lowered our quality thresholds to ensure that we can deal with at least some of the trash that washes up in our multiplexes on a Friday. And thanks to the wonderful innovation that scientists call the Quote-Whore, we know that the threshold may yet descend through the floor and into the sewer. 9. Ten best lists Because I can't think of even five movies released last year that I'd pay to see again, not even on video. Because lists are a form of sexual sublimation and ego-food for Hornby-esque sadsack losers without dates. The good stuff 1. Robert Downey, Jr The most gifted actor of his generation (etc - but it is true), Downey has become both a poster child for pharmacological overkill and the most visible martyr of America's dementedly misguided War on Drugs. How could a troubled and fragile thespian genius be so persecuted? OJ Simpson is still walking the streets and Downey may be going back to jail. 2. Russell Crowe We already knew from The Insider that Crowe was a fine, subtle, vanity-free actor, happy to ruin his looks to play pudgy and useless. But Gladiator and Proof of Life prove that he's also a great movie star. One is not the same as the other, and the two rarely combine in one actor. Crowe is as manly as Connery and as subtle as Robert Ryan. Pity he sounds like such a prick in real life. 3. The Daily Show with Jon Stewart The funniest show on US television - a combination of spoof CNN and spoof Letterman, The Daily Show delivers fake news that eviscerates the real news. Jon Stewart for president! 4. Mainly About Lindsay Anderson Gavin Lambert's affectionate biography - an account of Anderson's depressingly attenuated career - is one of the best movie memoirs ever. Anderson's chosen gravestone epitaph: \"Surrounded by fucking idiots.\" 5. The coming strikes I don't want to see jobbing actors starve, but I have an idle reverie about the benefits of an extended writers' and directors' strike next year. The strike lasts forever, and the new studio material dries up. Exhibitors fall back on foreign and independent films to fill schedules. Surprisingly, movies starring nobodies do astonishingly well. Armed with this knowledge, studios and producers abandon the grim mathematics of $20m stars and their vain and baleful influence. The strike ends, the small fry happily resume their careers and the marquee-value morons find themselves stranded on high, arid ground, like dinosaurs ripe for extinction. Bring it on!",

The CBI applauded the package - \"business will always judge governments by what they do, rather than what they say\" - and offered a welcome to integrated local transport schemes which will \"help people get to work and goods to market\". The Council for the Protection of Rural England gave a mixed response - \"a jackpot for local transport, but also a tinderbox of controversy over possible new roads.\" It prompted backbench critics on both sides to claim that Lord Macdonald, who joined the Prescott team last year, had won the day, with the backing of pro-car elements in the Downing Street policy-making machine.

The company announced a pretax profit for the six months to October of \u00a33.67m, up 81%, driven by growth across all areas. Jeremy Delmar-Morgan, the chairman, said: \"The first half of the year produced very profitable growth. We continue to view the future with considerable optimism.\" The company is paying a maiden interim dividend of 0.5p. Profits fall at GTech GTech, the world's leading lottery operator and software supplier to Camelot, said yesterday that its third-quarter profit had fallen nearly 20%, - but it had still met Wall Street estimates on the strength of a 17% reduction in operating costs. \"We're continuing to evaluate our positioning in the market,\" chairman Bruce Turner said. \"We expect that there will be further [cost cutting] actions to enhance our competitiveness even further.\" L&amp;G appoints Goldman Sachs Legal &amp; General has appointed Goldman Sachs and Lazard as its investment bankers. The company has also reappointed UBS Warburg and Dresdner Kleinwort Benson as corporate brokers. Speculation that Barclays Bank might be preparing a bid for L&amp;G was dismissed by industry sources. Norway lists Statoil The Norwegian government is to list state oil and gas firm Statoil next year by selling a stake of between 10% and 25% and issuing new shares. \"This means Statoil will be able to do better in the international oil market and be a leading company in the European gas market for many years,\" said prime minister Jens Stoltenberg.",

The same moderate Tories were dismayed yesterday by Mr Hague's provocative speech on crime which raised fears that - with the Tories slumping in the polls - Mr Hague has decided to tack to the right in the run-up to the election. With no sign of a Tory victory, and indications that the party could be heading for a repeat of its 1997 defeat, they fear that Mr Hague has decided to tailor his message to appeal to core voters. The Conservative leader has mastered a technique for drumming up support among his party's hardcore supporters in a way that enrages moderate Tories who yearn for a return to the days of one-nation conservatism. The Tory leader's team of young staffers carefully monitors the outpourings of the rightwing press, usually on law and order, before picking on an issue which will guarantee favourable headlines in the Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph. Mr Hague's provocative intervention on crime yesterday was his most successful foray to the right since taking over as leader in 1997. He secured positive headlines in the Telegraph and the Mail on his criticisms of the Macpherson report which, thanks to the briefing overnight, glossed over the more balanced elements of the speech.

Mr Bush's brother Jeb, the governor of Florida, announced a wide-ranging inquiry into the state's voting and counting methods, while the secretary of state, Katherine Harris, unveiled plans for a wholesale upgrade of Florida's controversial voting machines. In Washington, the Republican Senate leader Trent Lott said election law reform could be at the top of the Bush administration's legislative priorities as it seeks to consolidate its legitimacy after the bitterest presidential contest in living memory. Republican leaders realise they could face a massive voter backlash in 2002 and 2004 if they are not seen to take prompt action to guarantee future fairness in a system that so manifestly failed to do so in this year's contest. On his first full day as America's official leader-in-waiting, President-elect Bush attended a prayer meeting in Austin, Texas, while aides announced that he will travel to Washington next week to meet President Clinton and his Democratic rival Al Gore, who finally conceded defeat on Wednesday after 36 days of protests over the voting in Florida.

The former MP's QC, Anthony Boswood, said that his solicitors were approached on Wednesday afternoon by former armed robber turned journalist John McVicar with a tape of an alleged conversation between Benjamin Pell and a freelance journalist, Mark Hollingsworth. Mr Hamilton claims he would not have lost his libel action, which left him with estimated costs of \u00a32m, if the court had known that the Harrods boss was allegedly involved in paying \u00a310,000 for legal documents which Mr Pell was said to have taken from dustbins outside the chambers of Mr Hamilton's lawyers. He says that the verdict should be set aside, given Mr Fayed's \"gross impropriety\". Mr Fayed has told the appeal court he had no knowledge of the stolen legal documents. Mr Boswood has alleged that Mr Hollingsworth, who was engaged by Mr Fayed to help with the Hamilton litigation, took the documents to Mr Al Fayed's security chief, John Macnamara, and was paid \u00a310,000 in cash with the promise of a further \u00a310,000. Yesterday, Mr Boswood said the tape \"appears to show these disgraceful activities continuing beyond the conclusion of the trial and into the stage of appeal and post-trial litigation unabated\". Mr Hamilton had sued Mr Fayed over claims in a January 1997 Channel 4 Dispatches programme that he accepted cash payments, gift vouchers and a free holiday at the Paris Ritz in return for asking parliamentary questions on behalf of Mr Fayed.

The warning from Sir Richard Wilson, head of the civil service and cabinet secretary, came yesterday as a report revealed that women still have serious problems breaking the glass ceiling in the public sector. Figures released in the civil service annual report reveal that although the percentage of women getting jobs among the top 3,000 civil servants has jumped from 17.8% to 22%, it was still far short of the government's target of 35%. Among the most senior civil servants - from under secretaries to permanent secretaries - the percentage of women had risen from 12.7% to 18%. But this still fell far short of the government's target of 25%. Sir Richard said yesterday: \"Although for the first time among new recruits there is a parity between men and women getting jobs, we will have great difficulty in reaching the 35% target among senior civil servant posts.\" His views were confirmed yesterday by a report from the Hansard commission on Women at the Top. The report's author, Karen Ross, called for a \"strong steer\" from government to encourage action from employers to ensure that qualified women are not passed over for promotion in government, the civil service, the courts, the NHS and the education system. The commission chairwoman, Lady Howe, said: \"The attitudinal barrier - the clubby culture as we sometimes called it - to women entering the very top decision making levels remains firmly fixed.\" Yesterday's report comes 10 years after the commission's first study, and finds that, while there has been some progress, it has come \"nowhere near\" matching the abilities and ambitions of the most talented women. The Hansard Society director, Shelagh Diplock, said: \"Since the launch of the influential commission report in 1990, there has been much talk of women moving up and even taking over from men in the world of work and public life. \"Dr Ross's report is a timely reminder that urgent consideration still has to be given to ensuring that women's talents are properly valued in the public sector.\" The civil service annual report showed that Whitehall's record has improved in recruiting people from ethnic minorities and disabilities.

The embarrassing allegation, contained in two anonymous letters sent to the city judicial authorities, is now the subject of an investigation by Palermo magistrates. Details of the investigation were published yesterday by the newspaper La Repubblica. \"The palace of the anti-mafia was built by the Mafia. All of it, from the foundations to the roof,\" the paper said. Contracts for construction work on the modern glass and steel complex, which will house judicial offices once the UN delegates have moved on, were divided up among mafia-owned firms, it said. Pietro Grasso, Palermo's chief public prosecutor, confirmed yesterday that his office had opened an investigation into the claims, contained in the one-page letters posted on September 18. The news is a further blow for the mayor of Palermo, Leoluca Orlando, whose name was published in a list of politicians and businessmen allegedly linked to the Mafia on the eve of the meeting . Mr Orlando is considered a hero of the struggle to liberate Sicily from the mob's stranglehold, and investigators said the allegation that he was a Mafia accomplice was an old claim from an unreliable witness. The inquiry will seek to determine whether Mafia-controlled firms won contracts to build the \"justice citadel\", which will house 28 court rooms and 370 offices in a 37,000 square metre complex. News of the investigation will come as a shock to those - notably the executive director of the UN office for drug control and crime prevention, Pino Arlacchi - who recently suggested that the Mafia was on its last legs, and to residents of Palermo who were proud of their city's unaccustomed status as a role model in the fight against organised crime. The first contract for the building was won by a Rome company called Sinces Chiementin, which was secretly controlled by one of the Mafia's most ruthless bosses, Giovanni Brusca, La Repubblica said. Before the first excavator moved into action, the plans for the entire complex were said to be in the hands of Toto Riina, the now imprisoned \"boss of bosses\". The man who gave him refuge during his last days on the run, Giuseppe Montalbano, owned another of the firms involved in the construction work, the paper said. Among the delegates in Palermo yesterday was David Trimble, the Northern Ireland first minister, who attended a symposium on the role of civil society in countering organised crime.

      "body": "<p>The wrinkly rocker of the British music press, Melody Maker, has finally been pensioned off, overtaken by its hip younger rival NME. </p> <p>The Maker, as it is affectionately known, has been published weekly since 1926. But it was finally killed off by IPC, owners of both publications, blaming falling sales which made the music paper \"unsustainable\". </p> <p>News of the closure of the world's oldest weekly pop magazine puts a question mark over the future of other music publications which have been experiencing declining sales. </p> <p>Two weeks ago the monthly music magazine Select was forced to close because of falling readership and competition from the internet, in particular bands' own websites. The 90s saw the demise of Sounds, reflecting an increasingly competitive market. </p> <p>Critics said NME had always outperformed its rival and had learned better than Melody Maker from the underground press. It had picked up more quickly on both punk-as-politics and post-punk as post-modernism. </p> <p>By contrast, Melody Maker looked turgid and limped along with 10 page articles on the band Yes, and with a design which reflected the then editor Ray Coleman's belief that \"it should look like the Daily Telegraph\". It earned the unenviable nickname Monotony Maker. </p> <p>At its last audited circulation, Melody Maker was selling 32,500 copies, the lowest figure in its history, down 14.9% year on year. Few bands bothered advertising gigs because readership was so low. </p> <p>The magazine also failed to get interviews with frontline pop groups as most preferred NME. There were few big name writers left either, most having been poached or defected to other publications. </p> <p>In a last attempt to revive the flagging magazine's fortunes, IPC changed Melody Maker's format from broadsheet to magazine size in October last year. It hoped to attract younger readers in the 16 to 20 bracket rather than the 22-year-old age group. But this proved disastrous and reduced readership still further. </p> <p>In an interview with NME's music website, IPC's managing director, Mike Soutar, said: \"We are merging Melody Maker into the NME brand. The final issue of Melody Maker will be published at Christmas. </p> <p>\"We are ceasing the magazine's publication because, unfortunately, market conditions made continued publishing impossible. The magazine was doing exactly what it should have been doing but the readers were just not there in sufficient numbers to keep it viable.\" Mr Soutar said various options had been investigated, including changing the magazine to a monthly. </p> <p>\"But as Emap's recent closure of Select magazine indicates, the monthly indie rock market is as tough as the weekly market.\" </p> <p>Last night, Radio One disc jockey Steve Lamacq said Melody Maker had always been perceived as the musicians' paper. It was founded as a magazine for musicians, and most major bands and Britpop groups found fellow band members through ads in its classified section. </p> <p>\"That's the one thing NME will look to retain, because Melody Maker has been an integral part of the music scene,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Editorially, the magazine was really about jazz in the mid-70s and prog rock. It got into punk slightly quicker than the NME and evolved during the 80s into something that was more left of centre, indie and alternative rock. In the last 20 years, that sort of music has been in and out of fashion, but Melody Maker was always behind the NME in sales. </p> <p>\"For a while, Melody Maker was more well known in the States than NME but it never really capitalised on the times when it was doing well in this country. But it has been going down, in tandem with most other publications, for the past five or six years.\" </p> <p>He added: \"The closure was a business decision. Melody Maker was just not selling enough copies to keep it going. If you go back 10 years, you would scour the Melody Maker for singles reviews and think 'I'll buy that because it sounds quite good'. But now if you go through the singles reviews in both NME and Melody Maker, you will have already heard two-thirds of those on the radio. </p> <p>\"Also, you can get gossip from the internet. Many bands have their own websites that give you far more information than the music press. Garbage, Ash and the Offspring all have regularly updated diaries of what they are doing, so you are getting that info straight from the horse's mouth.\"</p>",

Two weeks ago the monthly music magazine Select was forced to close because of falling readership and competition from the internet, in particular bands' own websites. The 90s saw the demise of Sounds, reflecting an increasingly competitive market. Critics said NME had always outperformed its rival and had learned better than Melody Maker from the underground press. It had picked up more quickly on both punk-as-politics and post-punk as post-modernism. By contrast, Melody Maker looked turgid and limped along with 10 page articles on the band Yes, and with a design which reflected the then editor Ray Coleman's belief that \"it should look like the Daily Telegraph\". It earned the unenviable nickname Monotony Maker. At its last audited circulation, Melody Maker was selling 32,500 copies, the lowest figure in its history, down 14.9% year on year. Few bands bothered advertising gigs because readership was so low. The magazine also failed to get interviews with frontline pop groups as most preferred NME. There were few big name writers left either, most having been poached or defected to other publications. In a last attempt to revive the flagging magazine's fortunes, IPC changed Melody Maker's format from broadsheet to magazine size in October last year. It hoped to attract younger readers in the 16 to 20 bracket rather than the 22-year-old age group. But this proved disastrous and reduced readership still further. In an interview with NME's music website, IPC's managing director, Mike Soutar, said: \"We are merging Melody Maker into the NME brand. The final issue of Melody Maker will be published at Christmas. \"We are ceasing the magazine's publication because, unfortunately, market conditions made continued publishing impossible. The magazine was doing exactly what it should have been doing but the readers were just not there in sufficient numbers to keep it viable.\" Mr Soutar said various options had been investigated, including changing the magazine to a monthly. \"But as Emap's recent closure of Select magazine indicates, the monthly indie rock market is as tough as the weekly market.\" Last night, Radio One disc jockey Steve Lamacq said Melody Maker had always been perceived as the musicians' paper. It was founded as a magazine for musicians, and most major bands and Britpop groups found fellow band members through ads in its classified section. \"That's the one thing NME will look to retain, because Melody Maker has been an integral part of the music scene,\" he said. \"Editorially, the magazine was really about jazz in the mid-70s and prog rock. It got into punk slightly quicker than the NME and evolved during the 80s into something that was more left of centre, indie and alternative rock. In the last 20 years, that sort of music has been in and out of fashion, but Melody Maker was always behind the NME in sales. \"For a while, Melody Maker was more well known in the States than NME but it never really capitalised on the times when it was doing well in this country. But it has been going down, in tandem with most other publications, for the past five or six years.\" He added: \"The closure was a business decision. Melody Maker was just not selling enough copies to keep it going. If you go back 10 years, you would scour the Melody Maker for singles reviews and think 'I'll buy that because it sounds quite good'. But now if you go through the singles reviews in both NME and Melody Maker, you will have already heard two-thirds of those on the radio. \"Also, you can get gossip from the internet. Many bands have their own websites that give you far more information than the music press. Garbage, Ash and the Offspring all have regularly updated diaries of what they are doing, so you are getting that info straight from the horse's mouth.\"",

He has intervened directly in the US-led Middle East peace process, given succour to Iraq, and resumed arms sales to Iran and Libya. He visited North Korea, that most roguish of US-designated \"rogue states\", and cheekily claimed to have curbed its menacing missiles. He went to India, bidding to revive Soviet-era ties in direct competition with Bill Clinton's efforts to woo Delhi last spring; and has increased military and political cooperation with China - identified by Mr Bush as a potential 21st-century antagonist. Mr Putin regularly stresses Russia's national interests in the Balkans, its opposition to Nato expansion and its deep dislike of Mr Bush's plans for a treaty-busting national missile defence system.

But this geopolitical assertiveness is also a broader expression of his determination to make Russia a force in the world again. Although a distracted Washington has taken its eye off the ball, the challenge this represents to the US president-designate should not be minimised. Mr Putin is six years younger than Mr Bush, tougher and more experienced, and probably a lot smarter.</p> <p>In some areas, US-Russian interests coincide. Both countries seek to curb international terrorism; an accord was signed in Moscow this week. Both worry about Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Islamic insurgencies in central Asia. Both are pledged to promote bilateral trade; and Russia badly needs US support for further loans and credit to support market reforms. Mr Putin says he wants good relations with the west. Hence his cosy chats with Tony Blair and his pardoning of a US \"spy\". He has even indicated flexibility on NMD and Nato issues. But there is a darker, scarier side to Mr Putin, as seen in Chechnya. This Putin has a vision of a proud, revived Russia again advancing at home and abroad to the tune of the old Red Army anthem. His vision has power, purpose and coherence. Is poor Dubya ready for this? You tell us.</p>",

Mr Putin is six years younger than Mr Bush, tougher and more experienced, and probably a lot smarter. In some areas, US-Russian interests coincide. Both countries seek to curb international terrorism; an accord was signed in Moscow this week. Both worry about Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Islamic insurgencies in central Asia. Both are pledged to promote bilateral trade; and Russia badly needs US support for further loans and credit to support market reforms. Mr Putin says he wants good relations with the west. Hence his cosy chats with Tony Blair and his pardoning of a US \"spy\". He has even indicated flexibility on NMD and Nato issues. But there is a darker, scarier side to Mr Putin, as seen in Chechnya. This Putin has a vision of a proud, revived Russia again advancing at home and abroad to the tune of the old Red Army anthem. His vision has power, purpose and coherence. Is poor Dubya ready for this? You tell us.",

      "bodyText": "Officials of the federal General Services Administration yesterday presented America's new vice-president elect, Dick Cheney, with the keys to the official Washington city centre offices where the incoming team will be based for the next five weeks. America's new Republican government is formally known as the Bush-Cheney administration, but the handover signalled that it might be more accurate to call it the Cheney-Bush team. While it was left to Mr Cheney to take yet another of the important steps towards installing the new government in the US capital, president elect George W Bush went to church and held private meetings in Austin yesterday, much as he has done for most of the past month. In the weeks since election day, it has been Mr Cheney who has set up the Bush transition team, who has interviewed potential members of the administration, and who has taken charge of negotiations with congressional lead ers about the legislative agenda. The government-in-waiting had been based in Washington's Virginia suburbs, near to Mr Cheney's home, while the court wrangles in Florida were being played out. Now they can begin moving in to 90,000 sq ft of offices just two blocks away from the White House. Just as important, Mr Cheney also got access yesterday to $5.3m dollars (\u00a33.6m) that are set aside in the federal budget to pay for the transition. \"We're moving forward with the transition,\" Mr Cheney said. \"Things are going well.\" For a man who suffered a fourth minor heart attack only last month, Mr Cheney is being forced to set a demanding pace and carry out a punishing schedule as he takes up a role which seems more akin to that of prime minister than the traditional marginal vice-presidential role. Mr Cheney exemplifies the much noticed fact that many of the most important posts in the new Bush administration will be taken by people who also worked for the new president's father when he was in office a decade ago. But his background - as a former congressman, White House chief of staff and defence secretary - also fills in many of the gaps in Mr Bush's own experience. Two jobs, in particular, have fallen on Mr Cheney's shoulders as the Republicans strive to complete their administration building in a much shorter time frame than they had expected. They have only half the normal time - just 37 days. The first is to recruit nearly 7,000 people to fill political jobs in Washington which will be vacated when the Clinton administration leaves town in five weeks' time. Already, Mr Cheney has 16 assistants working through more than 20,000 applications. The bulk of these have come over the internet, but transition officials say they believe thousands more have been caught up in the Christmas post. Mr Cheney's second major preoccupation is his negotiations on Mr Bush's behalf with political leaders in the legislative branch of the government on Capitol Hill. He spends several hours on the telephone each day with Republican politicians as he tries to hone the new administration's legislative priorities with a host of political and lobby interests.

      "body": "<p>In 1974 I saw a film which powerfully influenced me for several weeks. It was Emmanuelle - a controversial but highly popular soft-core porno movie based on a scandalous bestseller about the sex lives of bored, rich, French expatriates in Thailand. It was directed by a fashion photographer called Just Jaeckin and starred a fabulously beautiful woman one assumed was French but who turned out to be Dutch - Sylvia Kristel. Emmanuelle's only \"known\" element was the former newwave actor Alain Cuny. Cuny, who hated the project, played a tuxedoed rou\u00e9 who seduces the eponymous heroine. His character's name was Mario. </p> <p>I was so impressed by Emmanuelle and Cuny's absurdist performance that I decided to try his pick-up line \"Let me take you to the derni\u00e8res limites... of erotisme!\" on all practical occasions. It did not work. </p> <p>Emmanuelle, on the other hand, worked very well. As the US trailer breathlessly intoned, \"Twelve million Frenchmen stood in line for it!\" I suspect there were a few Frenchwomen in that line as well. James Ferman, who was then the British film censor, recalls seeing Emmanuelle in a cinema full of groups of young women. It was the first sex film to play in \"normal\" British cinemas: Ferman says it was \"the first film [of its genre] that didn't play to the raincoat brigade\". </p> <p>Emmanuelle suffered the lash of censorship. A scene in a bar - shot by another director, disowned by Jaeckin - was cut by the BBFC, as was a sequence in which Mario encourages the rape of Emmanuelle as part of her sexual \"education\". Kristel disliked the scene and refused to play it in an erotic way. \"I pulled faces,\" she recalls. Today Ferman defends cutting the rape scene. He feels the BBFC can afford greater licence in scenes of consensual sex, but that rape fantasies should still be forbidden. He makes his case well, though his view is not shared by feminists such as Linda Ruth Williams or Nadine Strossen, of the American Civil Liberties Union. Emmanuelle was screened uncut in American cinemas: I saw it there a few years later, along with Jaeckin's banned-in-Britain The Story of O. Neither film left me feeling particularly corrupted. </p> <p>Just Jaeckin says his film was the first to portray lesbianism in a positive way: in fact it was preceded by the similar Bilitis and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Isabelle. But these films didn't reach the wide audience Jaeckin's feature did. Emmanuelle set the template for 1,000 soft-focus softcore fantasy sequences on film and paper. Emmanuelle quickly became a franchise, more than one franchise in fact. French producer Alain Sirisky made a series of subsequent features all claiming to be based on the book by Emanuelle Arsan. Kristel appeared in at least four of them. The Italians, unbeatable at generic rip-offs, came up with their own series of Emanuelle movies - note the single \"m\"! </p> <p>Their series starred Laura Gemser. While Kristel's Emmanuelle was a bored European housewife, sometimes vulnerable, sometimes manipulative, often naked, Gemser's Emanuelle was a New York-based Indonesian photojournalist who in the course of her work often had to get naked. </p> <p>The genre ran out of steam in the mid-1980s: as videos became ubiquitous, porno went portable. A sure sign of any form's demise is its being absorbed into the popular culture via a Carry On film: the Carry On Emmannuelle (with an extra \"n\") followed inevitably. Today one of the franchises continues in a series of cable and straight-to-video movies, but Emmanuelle is seen no more on the big screen. Not that anything remotely similar has taken its place there. With the exception of the Emmanuelle-ish Eyes Wide Shut, sex is almost invisible now in a cinema geared to knee-jerk scenes of sentimentality and violence. </p> <p>But the Emmanuelle films remain, entertaining, sexy, and a little mad. They may also seem old-fashioned, arch, vapid, camp. They are atrociously dubbed. It's hard to imagine them being taken seriously, or giving real offence. But they were controversial and ground-breaking in 1974 - forcing back the power of film censorship in France, Britain and elsewhere. My enthusiasm for these films is not just that I find them funny and a turn-on. I like them in the same way I enjoyed The Trip, Django, Trash, and The War Game. These were all films from which the \"authorities\" of the day felt British viewers must be protected. </p> <p>Yet the individual quality of these films is less important than the civil liberty issues they represent. The Lord Chamberlain no longer gets to censor the theatre, and high court judges have less jurisdiction over whether or not our servants can read Lady Chatterley. Yet films and television - particularly films - are subject to a degree of paternalistic control in this country which seems inexplicable as soon as one travels abroad. </p> <p>Gemser eventually got bored by a career which culminated in Emanuelle Vs the Cannibals. Having scrupulously saved her money, she retired to the mountains outside Rome. Kristel remains a working actress, living in Amsterdam. The two worked together only once, on the first sequel, Emmanuelle: the Joys of a Woman. For my money this is the best of the series. Joys of a Woman takes up where Emmanuelle left off. In a brief hour and a half, it escorts the viewer on a \"tour\" of erotic situations in the same way that Sergio Leone's masterpiece, Once Upon a Time in the West, leads us through a landscape of western movie conventions. </p> <p>The film begins aboard a packet steamer. Emmanuelle has booked a stateroom. But lo! No staterooms are available. After rejecting the advances of a sleazy crew member, she finds herself in a dormitory full of semi-naked Asian women. A fellow passenger, clad in white underwear (one of the film's recurrent motifs!) tells Emmanuelle how she was raped at school. There is a flashback demonstrating this. But this is pure fantasy, as the lupine Emmanuelle is aware. Her fellow traveller's story is just that - a story, designed to entice Emmanuelle to lustful deeds. </p> <p>As the film progresses, further archetypal sexual situations present themselves, like the gunfighters and villainous railroad magnates of Leone's film. Emmanuelle has sex with a black dance instructor, a tattooed polo player, her husband, and deflowers an ingenue. There is erotic massage. There is cartoon sex (still banned by the BBFC for its \"explicitness\"!). Emmanuelle is no longer the innocent, but the manipulatrix. She provokes increasingly bizarre situations, and fantasises about having sex with three sailors (clad in sailor suits, of course). But she is always in control. </p> <p>As if to emphasize the comedy inherent in all this, the director includes a character called \"the aviator\". First seen taking a bath (this is the only softcore Emmanuelle film to show frontal male nudity), the aviator hangs around the heroine's lavish pad with a huge aeroplane propeller - a sexual symbol, or a surrealist one? He and she never have sex, and the aviator finally announces: \"Well, I'm off to the airport.\" (People are always off to the airport in these movies: the shot of the plane taking off replacing the venerable train-entering-the-tunnel). \"Don't forget your propeller,\" Emmanuelle's husband replies. </p> <p>Emmanuelle: the Joys of a Woman was directed by another fashion photographer, Francis Giacobetti. I called him at his Paris flat and tried to chat about about his quite remarkable film. Giacobetti demurred. \"It is very charming of you to call, and I am happy to talk to you about almost anything. I'm actually a bit of an Anglophile! But Emmanuelle 2? No - I have no time for these films. They are rubbish!\" </p> <p>Perhaps they are. So are most motion pictures. But I think Giacobetti is too critical of his own work, with its powerful cine-referential images, dreamlike, erotic and surreal. Even 26 years on, show me a beautiful Dutch woman and an aviator leaning against his propeller, and I'll still offer to take them to the derni\u00e8res limites de l'\u00e9rotisme... </p> <p>In my dreams. </p> <p> \u0095 Alex Cox's documentary Emmanuelle - A Hard Look will be shown on Channel 4 in the New Year.</p>",

A fellow passenger, clad in white underwear (one of the film's recurrent motifs!) tells Emmanuelle how she was raped at school. There is a flashback demonstrating this. But this is pure fantasy, as the lupine Emmanuelle is aware. Her fellow traveller's story is just that - a story, designed to entice Emmanuelle to lustful deeds. As the film progresses, further archetypal sexual situations present themselves, like the gunfighters and villainous railroad magnates of Leone's film. Emmanuelle has sex with a black dance instructor, a tattooed polo player, her husband, and deflowers an ingenue. There is erotic massage. There is cartoon sex (still banned by the BBFC for its \"explicitness\"!). Emmanuelle is no longer the innocent, but the manipulatrix. She provokes increasingly bizarre situations, and fantasises about having sex with three sailors (clad in sailor suits, of course). But she is always in control. As if to emphasize the comedy inherent in all this, the director includes a character called \"the aviator\". First seen taking a bath (this is the only softcore Emmanuelle film to show frontal male nudity), the aviator hangs around the heroine's lavish pad with a huge aeroplane propeller - a sexual symbol, or a surrealist one? He and she never have sex, and the aviator finally announces: \"Well, I'm off to the airport.\" (People are always off to the airport in these movies: the shot of the plane taking off replacing the venerable train-entering-the-tunnel). \"Don't forget your propeller,\" Emmanuelle's husband replies. Emmanuelle: the Joys of a Woman was directed by another fashion photographer, Francis Giacobetti. I called him at his Paris flat and tried to chat about about his quite remarkable film. Giacobetti demurred. \"It is very charming of you to call, and I am happy to talk to you about almost anything. I'm actually a bit of an Anglophile! But Emmanuelle 2? No - I have no time for these films. They are rubbish!\" Perhaps they are. So are most motion pictures. But I think Giacobetti is too critical of his own work, with its powerful cine-referential images, dreamlike, erotic and surreal. Even 26 years on, show me a beautiful Dutch woman and an aviator leaning against his propeller, and I'll still offer to take them to the derni\u00e8res limites de l'\u00e9rotisme... In my dreams. \u0095 Alex Cox's documentary Emmanuelle - A Hard Look will be shown on Channel 4 in the New Year.",

      "body": "<p>'Tis definitely the season to be jolly. MoneyUnlimited doesn't want to spoil the fun, but does think it's worth mentioning the impact the festive season can have on your finances. </p> <p>Christmas and the New Year bring their very own insurance risks. Keep them in the back of your mind and, hopefully, you won't be filling in claims forms in the New Year. Here's a few of them:</p> <p><strong>Drinking and driving</strong><br> Drinking and driving could lead to a massive increase in your car insurance premiums: up to \u00a3400, according to the AA. <br>A 36-year-old man with a no-claims bonus would, it said, be paying \u00a3654 before a drink driving conviction and \u00a31,064 after. And that's assuming someone will insure him. The AA canvassed its members and found three-quarters saying they would not quote for any driver immediately after a drinking offence, whilst half would still not consider insuring him five years after the conviction. An insurance hangover, indeed. </p> <p><strong>Mini-cabs</strong><br> If you live in London, beware. Police believe thousands of unlicensed and uninsured mini-cab drivers will be cashing in on the transport dearth over Christmas. If you have an accident whilst travelling in one of these cabs, you can forget about compensation. And drivers should be equally cautious. A crash with one of these cabs will leave you picking up the insurance bill. </p> <p><strong>Theft</strong><br> According to Direct Line, burglaries go up 25% over Christmas, with thieves making a \u00a373.2m profit. Drawing back the curtains so the neighbourhood can see your lovely tree with all the presents underneath is, therefore, not a sensible thing to do.</p> <p> Some insurers, including Direct Line and Royal &amp; SunAlliance, automatically increase home contents cover by 10% over Christmas. But if you're buying expensive gifts, such as a computer or state of the art sound system, it's worth checking that your insurance covers them. Make sure locks on doors and windows are secure - particularly important if you're among the 28% of adults who spend Christmas away from home - and keep those presents hidden.</p> <p><strong>Fire</strong><br> Lights and decorations can overload power points, so don't plug them all in the same place and check the plugs have the right fuse: Christmas tree lights need a three amp fuse. Don't leave flexes trailing across the floor and don't leave the tree lights on when you go to bed.</p> <p><strong>Pets</strong><br> Fido and Fifi can get quite sick over the festive season if a few precautionary measures aren't taken.

      "bodyText": "'Tis definitely the season to be jolly. MoneyUnlimited doesn't want to spoil the fun, but does think it's worth mentioning the impact the festive season can have on your finances. Christmas and the New Year bring their very own insurance risks. Keep them in the back of your mind and, hopefully, you won't be filling in claims forms in the New Year. Here's a few of them: Drinking and driving Drinking and driving could lead to a massive increase in your car insurance premiums: up to \u00a3400, according to the AA. A 36-year-old man with a no-claims bonus would, it said, be paying \u00a3654 before a drink driving conviction and \u00a31,064 after. And that's assuming someone will insure him. The AA canvassed its members and found three-quarters saying they would not quote for any driver immediately after a drinking offence, whilst half would still not consider insuring him five years after the conviction. An insurance hangover, indeed. Mini-cabs If you live in London, beware. Police believe thousands of unlicensed and uninsured mini-cab drivers will be cashing in on the transport dearth over Christmas. If you have an accident whilst travelling in one of these cabs, you can forget about compensation. And drivers should be equally cautious. A crash with one of these cabs will leave you picking up the insurance bill. Theft According to Direct Line, burglaries go up 25% over Christmas, with thieves making a \u00a373.2m profit. Drawing back the curtains so the neighbourhood can see your lovely tree with all the presents underneath is, therefore, not a sensible thing to do. Some insurers, including Direct Line and Royal &amp; SunAlliance, automatically increase home contents cover by 10% over Christmas. But if you're buying expensive gifts, such as a computer or state of the art sound system, it's worth checking that your insurance covers them. Make sure locks on doors and windows are secure - particularly important if you're among the 28% of adults who spend Christmas away from home - and keep those presents hidden. Fire Lights and decorations can overload power points, so don't plug them all in the same place and check the plugs have the right fuse: Christmas tree lights need a three amp fuse. Don't leave flexes trailing across the floor and don't leave the tree lights on when you go to bed. Pets Fido and Fifi can get quite sick over the festive season if a few precautionary measures aren't taken. First and foremost, don't give your dog chocolate. It contains theobromine which is toxic to dogs, affecting their nervous and cardiovascular systems. Treatment usually involves an operation and this gets expensive. A dog who ate a chocolate orange costs his owner, or in this case his insurer, \u00a3543.40. Wrapping, tree decorations and pine needles can also be hazardous. One cat ate all the wrapping paper and ribbons off the presents and had to have a \u00a3110 operation to get 30 metres of ribbon out of her stomach. Pine needles get stuck in animals' throats and tinsel can make them choke. Holly, mistletoe and poinsettias should also be kept out of reach. Eating them can cause your pet's heartbeat and blood pressure to drop. Merry Christmas!",

As much as \u00a3800? </p> <p>While most people would agree that rampant materialism is hardly compatible with the spirit of the season, you still need to buy presents for family and friends and provide food and drink for visitors. </p> <p>Whether your budget extends to a couple of book tokens for close family or an extravagant party on the scale of Michael Douglas' wedding to Catherine Zeta Jones, it's usually a relief when the January pay cheque arrives. </p> <p>But how can you get through Christmas without cramping your style? Here's a few practical suggestions, plus some tips for ensuring that when January comes, your finances will be in better shape. </p> <p>&amp;#149 <strong>Set a budget</strong> <br> Not as easy as it sounds. It can be scary to cost out exactly how much you are likely to spend over the party season which starts in earnest the week before Christmas. Don't forget to include allowances for taxis and tips. This way you'll know whether you are going to go into the red, and be ready to </p> <p>&amp;#149 <strong>Sort out an overdraft in advance</strong><br> If you know that you haven't got enough in the bank to remain solvent until January, think about the cheapest way of borrowing. Personal loans and credit cards are expensive credit, and you are likely to get the most favourable terms from the bank where you already have your current account. <br> Some allow free overdrafts up to \u00a3250, others reduce the interest rate if the overdraft is pre-arranged. If you go overdrawn without notifying your bank first, you could be penalised quite heavily. </p> <p>&amp;#149You can find the current account that is right for you in our Data section of MoneyUnlimited </p> <p> <a href=\"http://moneyunlimited.moneyworld.co.uk/compare/currsrch.html\">Compare current accounts</a></p> <p>&amp;#149 <strong>Choose the right credit card for your needs</strong><br> The credit card market is now extremely competitive and you can choose the card that best suits your lifestyle.<br> For example, if you rarely manage to pay off the bill in full each month you would be better suited to a card which charged you an annual fee but which had a low rate of interest.<br> If you always settle your account within the interest-free period then the APR rate will be unimportant to you and you should choose a card for the other benefits, such as cashback or AirMiles that it offers. </p> <p>&amp;#149 Bear in mind that although credit cards are useful for very short-term borrowing, the interest rates can be prohibitive, particularly with store cards. Check the APR before you sign up. </p> <p>&amp;#149 Some of the new online banks, like Cahoot, have a selection of credit cards depending on your financial requirements. You can use the credit card comparison tool on the Data pages of this site. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://moneyunlimited.moneyworld.co.uk/compare/creditcards\">Compare credit cards</a></p> <p> The <strong>New Year</strong> is a good time to review your financial options and think about ways to make your money work harder. One option is to: </p> <p>&amp;#149<strong>Remortgage your home</strong> <br> How does your mortgage rate compare to the best in the market? If you are paying a variable rate it is likely to be much less competitive than fixed and capped rate special offers that lenders regularly offer new customers. </p> <p>Sadly, as an existing customer you may not have access to the best deals and may need to move to a different provider. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://moneyunlimited.moneyworld.co.uk/compare/mortsrch.html\">Compare mortgage rates</a></p> <p> Here's a couple of points to bear in mind: </p> <p>&amp;#149 You may be charged an administration fee of around \u00a3300 to set up a fixed, discounted and capped rate mortgage.</p> <p> &amp;#149 You may also be obliged to buy the lender's buildings and contents insurance which is unlikely to be the best deal on the market.</p> <p> &amp;#149 Unless the mortgage deal is unbeatable, you should shop around for buildings insurance. Depending on the size of your home and its location, you could save yourself anything from \u00a350 to \u00a3150. </p> <p> &amp;#149 You may be charged a penalty from your own lender for moving.

      "bodyText": "How much money do you reckon you need to spend in order to have a good Christmas? Around \u00a3100? As much as \u00a3800? While most people would agree that rampant materialism is hardly compatible with the spirit of the season, you still need to buy presents for family and friends and provide food and drink for visitors. Whether your budget extends to a couple of book tokens for close family or an extravagant party on the scale of Michael Douglas' wedding to Catherine Zeta Jones, it's usually a relief when the January pay cheque arrives. But how can you get through Christmas without cramping your style? Here's a few practical suggestions, plus some tips for ensuring that when January comes, your finances will be in better shape. \u2022 Set a budget Not as easy as it sounds. It can be scary to cost out exactly how much you are likely to spend over the party season which starts in earnest the week before Christmas. Don't forget to include allowances for taxis and tips. This way you'll know whether you are going to go into the red, and be ready to \u2022 Sort out an overdraft in advance If you know that you haven't got enough in the bank to remain solvent until January, think about the cheapest way of borrowing. Personal loans and credit cards are expensive credit, and you are likely to get the most favourable terms from the bank where you already have your current account. Some allow free overdrafts up to \u00a3250, others reduce the interest rate if the overdraft is pre-arranged. If you go overdrawn without notifying your bank first, you could be penalised quite heavily. \u2022You can find the current account that is right for you in our Data section of MoneyUnlimited Compare current accounts \u2022 Choose the right credit card for your needs The credit card market is now extremely competitive and you can choose the card that best suits your lifestyle. For example, if you rarely manage to pay off the bill in full each month you would be better suited to a card which charged you an annual fee but which had a low rate of interest. If you always settle your account within the interest-free period then the APR rate will be unimportant to you and you should choose a card for the other benefits, such as cashback or AirMiles that it offers. \u2022 Bear in mind that although credit cards are useful for very short-term borrowing, the interest rates can be prohibitive, particularly with store cards. Check the APR before you sign up. \u2022 Some of the new online banks, like Cahoot, have a selection of credit cards depending on your financial requirements. You can use the credit card comparison tool on the Data pages of this site. Compare credit cards The New Year is a good time to review your financial options and think about ways to make your money work harder. One option is to: \u2022Remortgage your home How does your mortgage rate compare to the best in the market? If you are paying a variable rate it is likely to be much less competitive than fixed and capped rate special offers that lenders regularly offer new customers. Sadly, as an existing customer you may not have access to the best deals and may need to move to a different provider. Compare mortgage rates Here's a couple of points to bear in mind: \u2022 You may be charged an administration fee of around \u00a3300 to set up a fixed, discounted and capped rate mortgage. \u2022 You may also be obliged to buy the lender's buildings and contents insurance which is unlikely to be the best deal on the market. \u2022 Unless the mortgage deal is unbeatable, you should shop around for buildings insurance. Depending on the size of your home and its location, you could save yourself anything from \u00a350 to \u00a3150. \u2022 You may be charged a penalty from your own lender for moving. This charge is know as a redemption penalty and may be levied if you pay off all or part of your loan early, or if you want to remortgage while your fixed, capped or discounted contract is still running. It is often equivalent to six months' worth of interest payments. There is more in the MoneyUnlimited Advice Bank on getting your finances in order.

Can you reconcile postwar modernism in both contemporary music and jazz in one all-embracing meta-music? Can you integrate the excitement and subtlety of jazz with the precision and purpose of classical music; the existential puzzles of indeterminacy with the vertiginous leaps and formal constraints of improvisation? Well, maybe sometimes, maybe never, but whatever your take on these thorny issues, you can be sure that Gunther Schuller has been there, done that and annotated the T-shirt. </p> <p>In fact he has done so much, as performer, composer, writer, educator and all-round musical enabler that he can be easily overlooked, or bracketed with just one slice of his wide-ranging talents. This concert, to mark his 75th birthday, saw several ensembles put together under the aegis of the London Sinfonietta. It was a chance to join the dots and hear music from several stages and genres of his long career as a composer/arranger. </p> <p>The Symphony for Brass and Percussion was a nice surprise. Composed by the self-taught Schuller before he turned 25, it shows his unmistakably American individualism. He describes how the ideas grew from playing French horn in an orchestra, and the piece was impressive for being a players' piece - though carefully crafted and structured in four movements - that explored the timbral possibilities of the brass section from the inside, in much the way that hands-on contemporaries such as Stockhausen would experiment with tape and electronics a few years later. </p> <p>There were several jazz arrangements written for, and featuring, Joe Lovano (tenor sax and bass clarinet), including Crepuscule with Nellie (written by Thelonious Monk for his wife) and Duke Ellington's Prelude to a Kiss. Lament for M was Schuller's own tribute to his late wife, Marjorie. The programme also included Tre Invenzione (1972), the kind of brittle, late-modernist score the Sinfonietta can do in their sleep, but the most effective pieces dated from the late 1950s and early 1960s. Night Music, Transformation and Densities 1 were superb works for medium-sized ensembles that integrated jazz and \"serious\" performance gestures in an elegant and unforced way, swinging (where appropriate) without dropping a note. Even when extensively notated, there was room for the distinctive timbres of jazz players such as Guy Barker, Chris Laurence, Anthony Kerr and Edwin Schuller (the composer's son) to emerge from, and merge with, the ensemble sound. </p> <p>The setting for the concert - an overlit \"straight\" presentation with long gaps between numbers while the stage was re-arranged - was dry and disappointing. You longed for the pace and atmosphere that Schuller achieves so naturally in a piece such as Headin' Out, Movin' In (1994) to be applied to the evening's celebration. It is heartening that there are many fine musicians prepared to tackle such challenges. Whenever the qualities of jazz and contemporary music are integrated without compromise and with Gunther Schuller is one of the pioneers we can thank. Many happy returns!</p>",

Sneaker Pimps lost Anglo-Indonesian singer Kelli Dayton, guitarist Chris Corner assumed vocal chores for the second album, Splinter (1999), and the band threatened to implode during a gruelling tour of the US. </p> <p>They look pretty ravaged tonight, in a sexily dishevelled, rock-star way. They could be a boy band on the skids. Guitarist/bassist Joe Wilson has the suit and, well, heft of a bouncer, and drummer David Westlake, also wearing a tie, is no oil painting, but keyboardist Liam Howe is - in his capped-sleeve T-shirt - a regular teen dream. Corner also has pin-up potential, even if his hairstyle would give sleepless nights to Limahl of the 1980s comedy hunks Kajagoogoo. Dressed in white flared jeans and a sheer white top that sticks to his skinny frame like cling-film, the snake-hipped frontman looks as though he is performing before a stadium crowd, or auditioning for the sequel to Velvet Goldmine, all insectoid elegance and heroin chic. </p> <p>If they're an odd visual mix, Sneaker Pimps' music is even harder to define. It's too undynamic to appeal to indie kids and not rhythmic enough to draw the dance fraternity (although the likes of DJ and Mixmag still write about them). Curl is typical, with its slow, atmospheric groove reminiscent of U2 during their \"techno\" phase. Unfortunately, much of the detail and drama of their songs is lost in the transition from studio to stage. The band readily acknowledge this, telling an interviewer: \"We weren't designed to perform songs live.\" </p> <p>And so Destroying Angel loses the cloying, sickly-sweet intimacy of its CD counterpart. Half Life, too, lacks the torpid sensuality of the recorded version. All you can hear is the steady, heavy beat of the drums and the mannered vocals, any trace of Hartlepool, Corner's birthplace, smothered by his mid-Atlantic drawl.

      "bodyText": "Of the trip hop acts to emerge in the wake of Portishead in the mid-1990s, Morcheeba embraced a more conventional soul-dance style and Moloko got discovered by the Ibiza set. Sneaker Pimps lost Anglo-Indonesian singer Kelli Dayton, guitarist Chris Corner assumed vocal chores for the second album, Splinter (1999), and the band threatened to implode during a gruelling tour of the US. They look pretty ravaged tonight, in a sexily dishevelled, rock-star way. They could be a boy band on the skids. Guitarist/bassist Joe Wilson has the suit and, well, heft of a bouncer, and drummer David Westlake, also wearing a tie, is no oil painting, but keyboardist Liam Howe is - in his capped-sleeve T-shirt - a regular teen dream. Corner also has pin-up potential, even if his hairstyle would give sleepless nights to Limahl of the 1980s comedy hunks Kajagoogoo. Dressed in white flared jeans and a sheer white top that sticks to his skinny frame like cling-film, the snake-hipped frontman looks as though he is performing before a stadium crowd, or auditioning for the sequel to Velvet Goldmine, all insectoid elegance and heroin chic. If they're an odd visual mix, Sneaker Pimps' music is even harder to define. It's too undynamic to appeal to indie kids and not rhythmic enough to draw the dance fraternity (although the likes of DJ and Mixmag still write about them). Curl is typical, with its slow, atmospheric groove reminiscent of U2 during their \"techno\" phase. Unfortunately, much of the detail and drama of their songs is lost in the transition from studio to stage. The band readily acknowledge this, telling an interviewer: \"We weren't designed to perform songs live.\" And so Destroying Angel loses the cloying, sickly-sweet intimacy of its CD counterpart. Half Life, too, lacks the torpid sensuality of the recorded version. All you can hear is the steady, heavy beat of the drums and the mannered vocals, any trace of Hartlepool, Corner's birthplace, smothered by his mid-Atlantic drawl. Low Five features John Barry-esque keyboard sounds and could, at a stretch, be a James Bond theme were a Bassey or a Cher to give it the camp diva treatment. They also preview their third album, provisionally titled Bloodsport, with the track Blue Movie, which plays on the connection between religion and sex. Corner returns alone for an acoustic encore, recasting himself as Bowie circa Hunky Dory, and seems genuinely touched by the response. \"You're beautiful,\" he tells his small yet devoted army of fans, although how many of them rush out to buy that third LP remains to be seen.",

Over many years, the panel's structure and procedures have been held up as a model of self-regulation, not just in the City but across all the world's main financial centres. Despite the panel's non-statutory nature, market participants feel duty bound to abide by its decisions. It has respect. </p> <p>With this in hand, a good portion of the panel's extraordinary power has been derived from its ability to act with flexibility. The code is carefully written and is followed to the letter, but in quite subtle ways the panel's officials have always retained the right to decide what the letters actually say. In short, the panel has maintained (and regularly executed) the right to intervene when it sees the spirit of its rules being breached. </p> <p>But the City of London is not the parochial place it once was. For a start, too many takeovers and mergers are now cross-border affairs - and the financial community is, quite naturally, begging for conformity of rules and regulations between different jurisdictions. Along the way, the trend to place everything on a statutory footing is proving irresistible. </p> <p>Witness the machinations over the European Commission's takeover directive, which aims to put merger and acquisition rules on a standardised footing across the continent. Wednesday's amendments by the European parliament, making corporate \"poison pill\" defences easier, will lead to many more months of pork-barrel negotiations before some sort of meaningful directive is possible. </p> <p>While this has been going on, the City's panel has been left drifting around in some sort of limbo. Its old ways of getting things done (or stopped) are on the way out; instead it is facing a future where decisions are likely to be challenged in the courts. In future, its officials will have to act much more as technicians than arbitrators. In the meantime, it seems it has lost the confidence to act, allowing one of Britain's most powerful banks to skirt around the existing hard-wired code with abandon. Unwittingly or otherwise, Lloyds is fast bringing a great City institution into disrepute. </p> <p><strong>Big worry</strong><br> </p> <p>Not a good day all round for the new-look American banking combine Chase. To cap a profits warning issued on Wall Street and confirmation of yet more job cuts, it has lost the business of a leading FTSE 100 company. </p> <p>Legal &amp; General revealed yesterday that it had ditched JP Morgan, now part of the Chase empire, as one of its financial advisers. L&amp;G, which had tried to do a deal with NatWest last year before the Scots stepped in, has also dropped Schroders, now gobbled up by the investment banking arm of another US financial services group, Citigroup. </p> <p>A penalty, perhaps, for its failed deal with NatWest.

It looks significant that it has replaced its former adviser with Lazards, an independent firm, and Goldman Sachs, a big US firm but one which is not locked in the internal political upheaval of a merger of its own. </p> <p>Getting to be as big as possible as fast as possible is an assumed priority in the world of investment banking.
