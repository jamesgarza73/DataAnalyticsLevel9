He hopes Peter Jones \"doesn't get caught up in the swing of it\". With Di Canio, it is usually the shove of it. </p> <p>\"Linesmen sometimes enjoy putting their flag up to give the home side an offside decision because the crowd all cheer,\" Redknapp said, \"and the home fans will cheer any mistake Paolo makes. </p> <p>\"I'm not saying it to try to get an edge, it is a genuine fear. It is easy for the officials to go along with the sway of the crowd. It is almost pantomime-like with all boos and cheers, so I can see it happening.\" </p> <p>Wednesday desperately need a win to have any hope of avoiding the drop, and there was ominous news for one of their struggling counterparts Derby, who visit Old Trafford. </p> <p>Manchester United have not been at their best of late but Sir Alex Ferguson warned yesterday: \"Someone is going to suffer.

He spent four years as assistant to Jim Smith at Derby - \"quite an ordeal,\" he joked - and recalled: \"He got me into the tasting of the red wine during many team talks into the early hours.\" </p> <p>The reunions continue at Tottenham, where Glenn Hoddle returns to his first club as Southampton manager.

They were midfield magicians and it is sad that those type of players have gone from the game and been replaced by all-action players.\" </p> <p>Bobby Robson picked up his first manager of the month award at Newcastle yesterday and promptly tried to dampen expectation ahead of today's visit of the bottom club Watford. </p> <p>In September Newcastle won 8-0 against Sheffield Wednesday, then at the bottom, but Robson said: \"Eight-nil drubbings are romantic, not realistic\". </p> <p>Wimbledon's embattled manager Egil Olsen, has spoken to John Hartson to clarify the striker's future. \"There is no bad feeling,\" Olsen said. \"John wants to help us stay in the Premiership.

This also allows him to stay in his seat with his back pressed firmly against the wall, a position he has always occupied since the day a few years ago when a passing nutter smashed a pint pot into the back of his head. </p> <p>Best will retell the details of the blood seeping down his face as matter of factly as if he were describing a mundane daily chore such as walking to the local newsagents. But then events that would take on nightmarish proportions for us seem commonplace in the life of Best, a 53-year-old still getting into a 20-year-old's scrapes. And as the Phene is as much a second home to him as the Coach and Horses was to Jeffrey Bernard, it is perhaps not surprising that it has been the backdrop to some of the biggest dramas in his life. </p> <p>Eighteen months ago he was sitting in the Phene with his teetotal son Calum when a van screeched to a halt outside and several men rushed out and began beating him black and blue. According to him they had not taken kindly to him hammering them on the pool table at another of his locals. </p> <p>Best, who was admitted to the Cromwell Hospital on Wednesday with stomach pains, spent yesterday sitting up in bed doing the familiar crossword while surreally reading his obituary notices. </p> <p>He will have been irritated and bemused that most of this premature prose, penned after false reports that he was fighting for his life on Thursday night, were echoes of the famous line \"Where did it all go wrong, George?\" attributed to a hotel waiter delivering champagne to the room he was sharing with one of his Miss Worlds. </p> <p>It is, he complains, how people always see him: poor, tragic George, who threw away not only a football career but his life, and who is forced to trade on his notoriety as a famous drunk to make a living. He feels fulfilled with his renewed life as a full-time celebrity. And his reaction to boozy footballers and pop stars who say they are \"frightened of ending up like George Best\" is \"You should be so lucky\". </p> <p>Some people are astonished to hear the details of Best's comfortable lifestyle, apparently believing that he has been living in a cardboard box under Waterloo Bridge. He has had his share of Waterloos: the premature ending of his football career; the descent into alcohol abuse that cost him his first marriage and led to him being imprisoned in 1984 for assaulting a policeman; most recently the loss of his flat to his former agent Murdo McLeod. </p> <p>But life goes on its erratic, eventful way for Best and, no matter how chaotic it looks to outsiders, he and his second wife Alex, 27, who call each other Bestie, see themselves as sailing on a sea of tranquillity. Booze may have put him back in hospital with suspected liver damage but he has cleaned up his act considerably in recent years, helped by Alex and his agent and close friend Phil Hughes. And two or three times a year he books himself into Henlow Grange health farm. </p> <p>Where he once had a reputation for 100% unreliability, he is now able to stay sober long enough to perform lucrative engagements on the after-dinner circuit and in advertising campaigns as well as holding down a regular spot as a football pundit on Sky TV on Saturday afternoons. He also has a share in his local Italian restaurant, where they serve wine under his own label. </p> <p>He has had the odd well-publicised lapse, such as when he stood up, clearly the worse for wear, at a northern football writers' function at the end of last year and was ushered off stage. Because of his reputation, Sky, which picks him up from the Phene on Saturday mornings, has Alan Mullery on stand-by in case Bestie comes over a bit Jeffrey Bernard. </p> <p>He has been so successful on the after-dinner circuit, sometimes selling out 400-seat venues two nights in a row, that he has been able to replace the lost flat with another, more splendid one in Cheyne Walk, one of London's most prestigious addresses. Recently he spent a week in Japan at the expense of a sports shop owner who decided that his presence would be a boost to sales at the store coincidentally called Bestie's. </p> <p>Last year he was recruited by Littlewoods pools for an advertising campaign to woo punters back from the national lottery and it proved such a success that he was then approached by the lottery franchise-holder Camelot. It amused him that at one point he was featured in both campaigns. </p> <p>Best, fearing the worst when the stomach pains began, went on the wagon 12 days ago and his agent said yesterday that he had vowed to stop drinking. However, it would be a serious threat to his career and lifestyle if he were to give it up permanently. Boozy men's-only nights where he performs most of his after-dinner engagements would test a man of iron will, let alone a man who once had a surgical implant which caused violent vomiting whenever he drank alcohol - and who still carried on raising his glass. </p> <p>In any case, no one really believes he will give up now.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Joe-Max Moore's success at Everton may not yet amount to a hill of beans, as his compatriots might say, but this Oklahoma-born striker is just about the most contented footballer you could hope to find. Forget all his recent Premiership trappings, the man's smile would light a shuttered room even if he were to be informed that in future he would be scoring goals for fun rather than a currency he still regards as alien. </p> <p>Moore owes his upturn in fortunes to the shrewd judgment of Everton's veteran defender Richard Gough. Had the former Scotland international not whispered in his manager Walter Smith's ear, the 29-year-old would still be plying his trade rather less than 24 hours from his native Tulsa with the Major League Soccer club New England Revolution, instead of lining up at Chelsea today. </p> <p>History has probably already been embroidered but, so the urban myth goes, it was a chance conversation between the two Scots last year which landed Moore his most important career break to date. Smith had decided he needed to bolster his wafer-thin squad by signing another forward to understudy his regular pairing of Kevin Campbell and Francis Jeffers, and he discussed his plight with Gough who, at the age of 37, has become Smith's confidant, first lieutenant and now captain. Gough, having recently returned from playing Stateside, knew just the man. </p> <p>\"He was free, which was one of the essential factors,\" Smith observes with the wry smile of a manager who is constantly being told his glass is neither half-full nor half-empty but completely drained. </p> <p>An exchange of phone calls, a positive interjection by one of Britain's most reputable agents, Paul Stretford, and Moore was on his way to Goodison Park and, rather improbably, the delicious prospect of a reunion with Duncan McKenzie, Everton's Mini-car-leaping maverick of the 70s. </p> <p><strong> McKenzie memories</strong><br> McKenzie, it seems, played a significant if unwitting role in convincing Moore his future lay not on the gridiron nor with the hoops but in football. Twenty or so years ago, when the youth of America were enthralled by the razzmatazz of the old North American Soccer League, Moore's oil-baron father part-owned the Tulsa Roughnecks, where the show-stopping star of an otherwise pedestrian side was, yes, the nomadic McKenzie. </p> <p>\"We had Duncan and he was my big hero,\" Moore says. \"They were good days because the likes of Pele, George Best and Franz Beckenbauer were playing against us.\" </p> <p>But being the offspring of a big fish in America's oil pond, who loved his football so much he bought the club, had its problems. Moore has long suffered from a whispering campaign. It is a subject he touches upon with understandable reluctance. </p> <p>\"I think everyone back home believes I'm the spoiled brat who made it in soccer because my dad was big in oil and owned the Roughnecks,\" he says. \"But that's just not the case. I was a ballboy at the club and grew up watching the top stars who played for us or who came to town. </p> <p>\"The NASL was big at the time, but then it folded and the Roughnecks went under. At the same time the bottom dropped out of the oil market. My dad had a lot of money in that business and the smaller companies like ours just couldn't cope; there were bankruptcies all over the place.\" </p> <p>Moore's family promptly headed west, where he landed a scholarship at the University of California, Los Angeles, the springboard to a professional career which has brought him 79 international caps for the United States, spells with the German second division clubs Saarbr\u00fccken and Nuremberg, a loan spell with Emelec in the Ecuadorian first division, and now utter contentment on the banks of the Mersey. </p> <p>\"This is what I have always wanted,\" he says. \"I wanted to come to this country and play at the highest level. I'm here, it's happening and yet it still does not seem real. </p> <p>\"My wife Martha and I have settled in so quickly; everyone has been so welcoming, we couldn't have asked for a warmer reception. If I'm honest, I didn't know a lot about Everton before I came over here on trial. I knew of them but not much about them. But now I understand they are a huge, huge club with great tradition and magnificent support.\" </p> <p>Moore's progress in the famous royal-blue jersey has been highly impressive. His burst of six goals in eight games - in all he has appeared 13 times for Everton - has been timely indeed for, with both Campbell and Jeffers sidelined through injury, he is now more mainstay than stand-in. </p> <p>\"At this level you simply must take your chance when it comes along,\" he says. \"I always knew getting into the first team would be the easy part of the equation; it's staying in the team which is so difficult. </p> <p>\"It has all gone so well for me, but the demands of the Premiership are great and if I am to make a real success of this I'll have to show the sort of consistency which players from the other side of the Atlantic aren't exactly famed for.\" </p> <p>Though Moore, who has been in the United States' last two World Cup squads, is the latest in a sprinkling of Americans to have made the grade in England, he admits that a Gold Rush-style stampede of his country's finest is unlikely. </p> <p>\"There have been a few before me - John Harkes, Kasey Keller, Cobi Jones, Brad Friedel and so on - but the problems with obtaining a work permit have often proved insurmountable,\" he says. </p> <p>\"There are players back home I believe would make the grade over here; not dozens of them but certainly a few. Football continues to grow in popularity in the States and I honestly believe that in a decade or so we will be strong enough to make a real impact on the international stage . . . maybe even to win the World Cup.\"</p>",

His burst of six goals in eight games - in all he has appeared 13 times for Everton - has been timely indeed for, with both Campbell and Jeffers sidelined through injury, he is now more mainstay than stand-in. \"At this level you simply must take your chance when it comes along,\" he says. \"I always knew getting into the first team would be the easy part of the equation; it's staying in the team which is so difficult. \"It has all gone so well for me, but the demands of the Premiership are great and if I am to make a real success of this I'll have to show the sort of consistency which players from the other side of the Atlantic aren't exactly famed for.\" Though Moore, who has been in the United States' last two World Cup squads, is the latest in a sprinkling of Americans to have made the grade in England, he admits that a Gold Rush-style stampede of his country's finest is unlikely. \"There have been a few before me - John Harkes, Kasey Keller, Cobi Jones, Brad Friedel and so on - but the problems with obtaining a work permit have often proved insurmountable,\" he says. \"There are players back home I believe would make the grade over here; not dozens of them but certainly a few. Football continues to grow in popularity in the States and I honestly believe that in a decade or so we will be strong enough to make a real impact on the international stage . . . maybe even to win the World Cup.\"",

The poor soul doesn't like Chelsea's training facilities near Heathrow. \"I have never known such dreadful training conditions in my entire career,\" he moans. \"We have to train amid gusts of wind and smells of coffee coming from the factory next door.\" And though it is hard to believe, there's worse. \"Every morning at 10.45 the manager has to stop speaking to us because Concorde flies overhead and no one can hear themselves think.\" Noisy, dirty, good in the air and Anglo-French. Sounds familiar, Frank. \u0095 Actually, what we want are more French footballer quotes like this: \"My husband has the best-looking pair of buttocks in the world. They are firm and nicely chubby.\" Adriana Karembeu on her hubby Christian of Real Madrid. Yes, we are trying to get to the bottom of rumours that Karembeu is on his way to Arsenal. \u0095 Mike Emerich, a government agent who will help guard the US presidential candidates Al Gore and George Bush in the forthcoming election, is obviously good at defence. In nine years of coaching the Thomas Stone boys soccer team in Washington DC, their record stands at 127 wins, 16 draws and just four defeats. \u0095 The recent game between Inter Tadley and Castle in the Basingstoke Sunday League had to be abandoned after 70 minutes. Reason? They ran out of balls. Inter's pitch is next to the Atomic Weapons Establishment and during the match the players managed to kick no fewer than eight balls over the barbed-wire security fence. \"The place is strictly out of bounds and we could have caused a major incident if someone had clambered over to retrieve them,\" said the Castle secretary Greg Clarke. \"Anyway, he might have come back day-glo green.\" \u0095 Following Newcastle's lead, Sheffield Wednesday fans are to fight their club's plans to move them to different seats. Supporters are adamant that they're happy where they are and don't want to be moved from behind the pillars.",

But I had not lost a wallet to a pickpocket since 1986, when I was trying to get into Ferdinand Marcos's newly-liberated palace in Manila. Alas, I never did get in to inspect his wife's collection of 600 pairs of shoes, which became legendary the moment its discovery was relayed to the media. </p> <p>In the press of the vast crowd, which had gathered the morning after Ferdy and Imelda's flight, I felt the wallet go. But this time, I felt nothing. It was a hot August morning in Barcelona, and Pat and I were walking down the hill from the Parc G\u00fcell, one of the spectacular memorials that form part of Antoni Gaudi's legacy to his native city. </p> <p>That was mistake number one. Pat was feeling unwell, but I was greatly impressed by the modern and efficient metro system. We should have taken a cab to our next stop. Instead, we were walking slowly towards the train, slowly enough to look more than usually decrepit. So we must have looked an easy mark to the young man in American casual clothes - shorts, trainers, T-shirt and baseball cap, who (so Pat decided later) had been following us. </p> <p>We should have known it was not to be our lucky day - walking down the busy high street towards the station, we were suddenly splattered with bird shit. It certainly felt like bird shit: there was rather a lot of it and the texture was slightly too pink. What else could it be? Step forward a helpful young man, who said in good-enough English: \"How terrible. Can I help you clean up? Look at the mess, it must have been elephants.\" </p> <p>I know, I know. Corny or what? But in that situation one is mainly concerned to get clean - that was mistake number two. There was a fountain across the street, our Good Samaritan explained. My initial reaction (it always is) was to reject help. But it was hot and he was decisive - mistake number three. </p> <p>Actually, it wasn't a fountain. We stepped into the courtyard of a block of flats. \"I live here,\" he said. \"I have water and some paper tissues.\" All this happened in barely a minute. There seemed to be a lot of bird shit on my back (it must have been a low-flying bird). Anyway, my friend said: \"Take your shirt off.\" Odd that, but I did. </p> <p>He brushed me down, then said \"Good luck, I'm late, I must go,\" and disappeared with a wave. </p> <p>It was another two minutes before I realised I was travelling light. Keys in my right pocket (on the same bottle opener I bought at the age of 16), wallet in the left, I can barely move 10ft without being able to feel them there. Everything fell into place at that point. Just as I had realised too late in the Manila crowd that the man who accused someone behind me of taking the wallet was actually the pickpocket's accomplice, so I now realised I was the victim of a polished routine. </p> <p>Pat had been wearing her handbag across her chest. That was why he'd settled for me, a few credit cards he wouldn't be able to use and the \u00a3100 in sterling, francs and pesetas which were (I think) inside the wallet. We phoned Marks and Spencer, whose Card Safe system we subscribed to in a moment of efficiency: they duly cancelled the cards. </p> <p>For form's sake rather than insurance (what insurance?), we then reported to the local police station. Surprise, surprise, they knew this dodge rather well. Everyone we told laughed at us. \"Hey, this is Barcelona,\" they said. Or \" Beaucoup de vol a Barcelone \", as they put it across the frontier. After all, our hitch-hiking son had lost his rucksack, barely a foot away at the time, while on the phone at Barcelona. </p> <p> Other friends had had bags razor-bladed and lost everything: car keys, car park ticket (nothing M&amp;S can do about that), cards, everything except the mobile that allowed them to cancel the lot. Someone else's boyfriend, a lorry driver, had woken up in his cab to realise he'd been gassed and robbed. That was winter; in summer they concentrate on caravaners, she explained. </p> <p>Oh yes, and there was the couple flagging down cars on the motorway, quite possibly one of whom was my mate in the baseball cap and T-shirt, because their caravan was \"on fire\". While kind-hearted friends of ours checked for the source of the smoke (a burning rag works quite well), chummy rifled the front seats of their opened car doors and made off. He probably said: \"Good luck, I'm late, I must go.\" </p> <p>Still, on my first visit since I hitch-hiked to Barcelona circa 1968, I liked the re-branded city and will go back.

      "trailText": "<p>Spike Jonze's Being John Malkovich is one of the most quirky and original films Hollywood has ever produced, says Joe Queenan. The question is, how will they cash in on its success?</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Every once in a while, Hollywood makes a film so thrillingly intelligent that you can't help wondering why they don't make more of them. Just such a film is Spike Jonze's Being John Malkovich, the most beguilingly quirky motion picture since David Mamet's The Spanish Prisoner.</p> <p>In this coy little affair, the reliable John Cusack plays a hirsute, downwardly mobile urban puppeteer who is forced by the vicissitudes of the American marionette industry to take a job as a lowly filing clerk. Since even in the best of times there has never been much demand in the United States for adult puppetry (Cusack's tour de force is a lurid re-enactment of seminal events in the lives of Heloise and Abelard), Jonze quickly establishes the psychological terrain of his motion picture - NeverNeverLand - preparing the audience for the moment when Cusack stumbles upon a hidden passage leading inside the actor John Malkovich's head. That is, the movie starts out at a rarefied level of weirdness, and then gets weirder. But weird in a fun way. Not like Quentin Tarantino or Abel Ferrara. Those guys are nasty.</p> <p>Once Cusack has unearthed the secret tunnel leading into Malkovich's brain, he does what any red-blooded American male - even a puppeteer - would do: he tries to figure out a way to make a lot of money out it. In due course, he and a confederate, played by the fetching Catherine Keener, set up a sort of cerebral theme park in which the opportunity to spend 15 minutes inside John Malkovich's brain is the single attraction. Obviously, a fun park with a ride like this doesn't need run-of-the-mill diversions like Ferris wheels.</p> <p>Were Being John Malkovich merely a film about a bunch of people who spend their hard-earned cash on traipsing around inside the skull of a moderately famous bald actor with a very annoying voice for 15 minutes, before being dumped onto the side of the New Jersey turnpike, the audience's interest would probably flag pretty quickly. It is not. It is first and foremost a withering attack on the puppeteering industry, which has had this kind of woodshedding coming for decades. But it is also a compelling love story. </p> <p>The epicentre of the love story is Cameron Diaz, who plays Cusack's long-suffering wife. One evening, she happens to be visiting Malkovich's brain while the actor is making love to Keener, whom Cusack openly worships. Because Diaz/Malkovich is a more passionate, adventurous partner than Malkovich himself, Keener now finds herself smitten by this riveting hybrid. This creates complications because she has little interest in the real John Malkovich, and absolutely no interest in Cusack, both of whom find her positively enthralling. Eventually, Cusack realises that if he is ever to win Keener's affection, he must dump Diaz and turn Malkovich into his own puppet. Meanwhile, Diaz realises that if she is ever to wind up in the sack with Keener, she must figure out a way to evict her old boyfriend from Malkovich's brain. Keener, for her part, has a hard time keeping track of who she is sleeping with at any particular time, so she tries to sleep with everybody. And Malkovich, reduced to a bystander's role as a tall, bald succubus with a very annoying voice, can do nothing but wait for all these lunatics to vacate his medulla oblongata and give him back his personality so that he can get back to making movies like Con Air.</p> <p>As the preceding makes clear, Being John Malkovich is a complex and in some ways confusing motion picture that raises a host of philosophical questions about celebrity, gender politics, the meaning of life, and the thin line separating sex from insanity. However, none of these questions need concern us here. What concerns us is how Hollywood will respond to the success of Being John Malkovich, and what this portends for those of us who are aficionados of films of this ilk.</p> <p>Traditionally, there have been two avenues the motion picture industry has taken in situations such as this. The first and most obvious is a series of sequels. The second is a series of rip-offs, or films 'inspired' by the success of the original. Personally, I am not all that sanguine about the prospects for Being John Malkovich II or Being John Malkovich II: First Blood.

      "bodyText": "Every once in a while, Hollywood makes a film so thrillingly intelligent that you can't help wondering why they don't make more of them. Just such a film is Spike Jonze's Being John Malkovich, the most beguilingly quirky motion picture since David Mamet's The Spanish Prisoner. In this coy little affair, the reliable John Cusack plays a hirsute, downwardly mobile urban puppeteer who is forced by the vicissitudes of the American marionette industry to take a job as a lowly filing clerk. Since even in the best of times there has never been much demand in the United States for adult puppetry (Cusack's tour de force is a lurid re-enactment of seminal events in the lives of Heloise and Abelard), Jonze quickly establishes the psychological terrain of his motion picture - NeverNeverLand - preparing the audience for the moment when Cusack stumbles upon a hidden passage leading inside the actor John Malkovich's head. That is, the movie starts out at a rarefied level of weirdness, and then gets weirder. But weird in a fun way. Not like Quentin Tarantino or Abel Ferrara. Those guys are nasty. Once Cusack has unearthed the secret tunnel leading into Malkovich's brain, he does what any red-blooded American male - even a puppeteer - would do: he tries to figure out a way to make a lot of money out it. In due course, he and a confederate, played by the fetching Catherine Keener, set up a sort of cerebral theme park in which the opportunity to spend 15 minutes inside John Malkovich's brain is the single attraction. Obviously, a fun park with a ride like this doesn't need run-of-the-mill diversions like Ferris wheels. Were Being John Malkovich merely a film about a bunch of people who spend their hard-earned cash on traipsing around inside the skull of a moderately famous bald actor with a very annoying voice for 15 minutes, before being dumped onto the side of the New Jersey turnpike, the audience's interest would probably flag pretty quickly. It is not. It is first and foremost a withering attack on the puppeteering industry, which has had this kind of woodshedding coming for decades. But it is also a compelling love story. The epicentre of the love story is Cameron Diaz, who plays Cusack's long-suffering wife. One evening, she happens to be visiting Malkovich's brain while the actor is making love to Keener, whom Cusack openly worships. Because Diaz/Malkovich is a more passionate, adventurous partner than Malkovich himself, Keener now finds herself smitten by this riveting hybrid. This creates complications because she has little interest in the real John Malkovich, and absolutely no interest in Cusack, both of whom find her positively enthralling. Eventually, Cusack realises that if he is ever to win Keener's affection, he must dump Diaz and turn Malkovich into his own puppet. Meanwhile, Diaz realises that if she is ever to wind up in the sack with Keener, she must figure out a way to evict her old boyfriend from Malkovich's brain. Keener, for her part, has a hard time keeping track of who she is sleeping with at any particular time, so she tries to sleep with everybody. And Malkovich, reduced to a bystander's role as a tall, bald succubus with a very annoying voice, can do nothing but wait for all these lunatics to vacate his medulla oblongata and give him back his personality so that he can get back to making movies like Con Air. As the preceding makes clear, Being John Malkovich is a complex and in some ways confusing motion picture that raises a host of philosophical questions about celebrity, gender politics, the meaning of life, and the thin line separating sex from insanity. However, none of these questions need concern us here. What concerns us is how Hollywood will respond to the success of Being John Malkovich, and what this portends for those of us who are aficionados of films of this ilk. Traditionally, there have been two avenues the motion picture industry has taken in situations such as this. The first and most obvious is a series of sequels. The second is a series of rip-offs, or films 'inspired' by the success of the original. Personally, I am not all that sanguine about the prospects for Being John Malkovich II or Being John Malkovich II: First Blood. As much as I enjoyed Jonze's mind-bending film, I'd had quite enough of Malkovich's vacant delivery by the end of the proceedings, and frankly didn't feel that I needed to know anything more about the inner workings of his brain. A far more profitable approach would be to create a whole series of films that take the Being John Malkovich theme in different directions. One thought is Being Jean-Claude Van Damne, in which a smart person like Cusack or Keener or just about anyone temporarily takes control of the Belgian kickboxer's brain and teaches him how to act. A not dissimilar approach could be taken in films like Being Adam Sandler, Being Pauly Shore and perhaps even Being Both Emilio Estevez And Charlie Sheen. Another possibility is a film in which a trio of hapless college students are trapped inside a highly intimidating actor's brain: The Blair Witch Being Christopher Walken Project is one title that might be considered. Films I would be less enthusiastic about include Being Emma Thompson or Kenneth Branagh, Being Rosie O'Donnell, Being Kevin Costner, and, of course, Being Roberto Benigni. On the other hand, I would welcome a movie in which John Cusack discovers a secret aperture that leads directly into the brain of a bald movie star with a very annoying voice. I am not sure exactly where Jonze could go with Being Telly Savalas, but based on his most recent film, he certainly doesn't seem short on ideas.",

Web cameras all over the world will show what places look like, such as Global passage. You can even virtually visit the Mayan ruins at Palenque in Mexico at www.virtualpalenque.com. The photographs here are 360-degree interactive navigable views supported by some pacy archaeological notes. The web is driven by information, and with its ease of communication it can really deliver independence and freedom. So if you really want to find a remote haven and enjoy the illusion of the lonely planet, then getting connected to the internet community is a first step that is well worth taking.",

Whether you're looking for a romantic break amid the last bite of winter, or to welcome spring in one of the most beautiful, best preserved and cleanest cities in Europe, there has seldom been a better time to visit. </p> <p>Stockholm's central station is as clean, orderly and pleasant a place to alight as you could imagine. It's hard to believe that this is a major capital-city terminus. Where are the beggars and boozers that populate every other bus station in the world's major cities? Well, this is Stockholm, and while poverty is far from non-existent, it is an extraordinarily civil city. Even a trio of buskers sharing brandy and cigarettes in the pale dusk looked like they made a decent living. </p> <p>This first impression - of a clean, small city populated by approachable well-heeled people - lasted throughout the weekend. It may or may not have much to do with the fabled 50 years of near socialism, but prosperity seems abundant. </p> <p>It's also one of those places where everyone you meet makes you feel vaguely ashamed of your ignorance. The Volvo-driving cabbies of Stockholm could probably double as interpreters at the UN. \"Do you speak English?\" I asked a walrus-moustached driver at the bus station. \"Of course,\" he boomed. \"And French and German.\" </p> <p>Situated on 14 islands at the point where Lake M\u00e4laren begins to mix with the Baltic Sea, Stockholm is a spacious, elegant and occasionally breathtaking place. A third of the city is water and another third parks and woodland. </p> <p>The bridges that link it pass over fast-flowing clear water carrying occasional chunks of ice, some of them yards across, that batter and bounce off the arches. It's so clean that in summer fishermen haul salmon out of these waters. </p> <p>At this time of year, during daylight hours at least, Stockholm feels like a city in hibernation. Only on Saturday afternoons in the streets around the huge NK department store is there any sense of bustle. Away from the centre, it's like Sunday morning all day, so quiet you can bump into the same rock legend twice in one day. Outside the SAS Raddisson Hotel on Saturday morning, we passed Elvis Costello on his way out. Two hours later we saw him again. Busy it is not. </p> <p>At night, Stockholm is a different proposition. Far from huddling round the home fires, the Swedes pour out in their droves. The restaurants in the city centre overflow, and the sheer variety of watering holes is evidence of a mature drinking culture. From jolly pubs specialising in frothy beer in the old town, to chi-chi bars where unfeasibly attractive sorts order manhattans in four languages, there is something for everyone (as long as you don't intend to stay sober). </p> <p>What they all have in common, however, is the culture of the cloakroom. In more temperate climes, it's considered acceptable to sling your coat over the back of a chair, but not in these latitudes. There simply wouldn't be enough chairs to cope with the weight of Puffas, mufflers, gloves, scarves and hats needed to cope with the climate. Instead, the bars and restaurants boast cavernous cloakrooms where at closing time plans for further boozing are hatched, and potential suitors are inspected under brighter lights. It's a world away from the raffle tickets and wan, shuffling queues at home. Trust me, cloakrooms can be fun. </p> <p>In daylight, the lack of crowds and open spaces make Stockholm a great city for walking off a hangover. Each of the islands is unique, and you can explore the four at the heart of the city comfortably in a weekend, as long as you take a hat. </p> <p>At the heart of the city is the island of Gamla Stan, the Old Town, site of the original settlement and now the sort of well-preserved medieval quarter that tourist boards everywhere would give their eye teeth for - a warren of narrow cobbled streets and timber cottages. As tourist quarters go, it is relatively uncommercial, refreshingly free of tat. If you must, you can buy a troll or a little witch on a small birch broom, but they're actually rather nice. Even the snowstorm paperweights are tasteful. </p> <p>What you should do here, and all over Stockholm, is eat. The city is said to have more restaurants per capita than any other in Europe. It is one of those places where you know that one stomach and three meals a day is not enough to do the place justice. </p> <p>The Swedes excel at both seafood and the under-rated art of comfort food. Thanks to the experience of countless Nordic winters, your average Swedish chef has a way with carbohydrate. The prime example is pittipanna , a fried jumble of finely-diced potatos, onion and ham, browned and topped with a fried egg. </p> <p>After a plateful, you realise why the Swedes appear to drink with impunity after dark; they'll always have this to soothe their hangovers. </p> <p><strong>The five best places to eat</strong></p> <p>1 <strong> Berns</strong>, Berzeli Park, Nybroplan <br> The magnificent main room was built as a theatre during the last century.

      "body": "<p>Even sports-mad Aussies will rarely have seen the like: 10,000 athletes, 28 disciplines, 635 sessions of sport between September 15-October 1, and an awful lot of fireworks. They will be cycling in Centennial Park, sailing from Rushcutters Bay and playing beach volleyball at Bondi. It is fitting that the 27th Olympic Games is being held in one of the most successful sporting nations on earth, and it is a big deal for a city that is already shining brightly. </p> <p>Sydney's economy is booming, tourist numbers have rocketed over the past few years, and more and more foreigners are arriving to live and work. Sydney has a certain magnetism charged by a fabulous climate and a wealth of activities and fine restaurants and caf\u00e9s. For a large city (roughly 4m), it is pleasantly and genuinely friendly. In January 2001, it celebrates the 100th anniversary of the federation of Australia. But first there is the small matter of the Olympics. </p> <p>Some of the estimated 5.5 million tickets that went on sale for events are still available. Finding out what's left is difficult. Tickets for the big athletics finals, swimming, water polo, gymnastics, basketball, tennis, the opening and closing ceremonies are almost impossible to come by. </p> <p>Sportsworld, the UK's officially-appointed Olympic tour operator, says booking levels have already exceeded the overall number achieved for the last Games, in Atlanta in 1996. Its website has an outline guide to the popularity of certain disciplines. Sportsworld has assigned five travel agents to sell their packages: Austravel, Quest Worldwide, Travelbag, Bridge the World and Boomerang. </p> <p>Read the small print for restrictions, and check whether you are in a hotel or a shared apartment. Such has been the scramble for accommodation that many of the city's 40,000-plus hotel and motel rooms have been booked for months. </p> <p>Sportsworld's website also has guide prices and details about what you get for your money. Those who book through one of the five assigned agents will receive a pre-determined cocktail of event tickets. They will know which sports they are going to see but not necessarily which sessions until they get to Sydney. Die-hard fans who book direct through Sportsworld can pick their sport and session. The only other way to get tickets for events is to risk it and try to buy them from a ticket booth after you land in Sydney. </p> <p>Those travelling to the Paralympic Games (October 18-29) are quids in as accommodation and tickets are a fraction of the price.

      "bodyText": "Even sports-mad Aussies will rarely have seen the like: 10,000 athletes, 28 disciplines, 635 sessions of sport between September 15-October 1, and an awful lot of fireworks. They will be cycling in Centennial Park, sailing from Rushcutters Bay and playing beach volleyball at Bondi. It is fitting that the 27th Olympic Games is being held in one of the most successful sporting nations on earth, and it is a big deal for a city that is already shining brightly. Sydney's economy is booming, tourist numbers have rocketed over the past few years, and more and more foreigners are arriving to live and work. Sydney has a certain magnetism charged by a fabulous climate and a wealth of activities and fine restaurants and caf\u00e9s. For a large city (roughly 4m), it is pleasantly and genuinely friendly. In January 2001, it celebrates the 100th anniversary of the federation of Australia. But first there is the small matter of the Olympics. Some of the estimated 5.5 million tickets that went on sale for events are still available. Finding out what's left is difficult. Tickets for the big athletics finals, swimming, water polo, gymnastics, basketball, tennis, the opening and closing ceremonies are almost impossible to come by. Sportsworld, the UK's officially-appointed Olympic tour operator, says booking levels have already exceeded the overall number achieved for the last Games, in Atlanta in 1996. Its website has an outline guide to the popularity of certain disciplines. Sportsworld has assigned five travel agents to sell their packages: Austravel, Quest Worldwide, Travelbag, Bridge the World and Boomerang. Read the small print for restrictions, and check whether you are in a hotel or a shared apartment. Such has been the scramble for accommodation that many of the city's 40,000-plus hotel and motel rooms have been booked for months. Sportsworld's website also has guide prices and details about what you get for your money. Those who book through one of the five assigned agents will receive a pre-determined cocktail of event tickets. They will know which sports they are going to see but not necessarily which sessions until they get to Sydney. Die-hard fans who book direct through Sportsworld can pick their sport and session. The only other way to get tickets for events is to risk it and try to buy them from a ticket booth after you land in Sydney. Those travelling to the Paralympic Games (October 18-29) are quids in as accommodation and tickets are a fraction of the price. Sportsworld is offering a five-night package in a three-star hotel for \u00a31,065 and 12 nights in a four-star hotel for \u00a31,475 (flying Emirates).

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair was accused yesterday of failing to take the lead in tackling the growing crisis in third world education with only weeks to go before a key UN conference aimed at getting 125m of the world's poorest children back into the classroom. Hopes of the British prime minister attending the conference at the end of this month in Dakar, Senegal, have faded. Yesterday Oxfam, which is leading a campaign for an $8bn (\u00a35.1bn) global action plan to tackle the crisis, said the prime minister was not providing the level of international leadership on education that the chancellor, Gordon Brown, had shown on managing third world debt. \"His leadership could make a real difference. He has so far failed to act and we are running out of time,\" said Kevin Watkins, a spokesperson for Oxfam. \"Unfortunately, education seems to be the number one issue at home, but not overseas.\" The Dakar forum marks the 10th anniversary of the international pledge on universal primary education, which was supposed to have been achieved this year but has now been moved back to 2015. Oxfam says even the 2015 target is doubtful, and it has called on Mr Blair to put the education crisis on the agenda of July's meeting of the group of eight leading economies in Osaka. In response, a Downing Street spokesperson said: \"We will be doing everything we can do to get education in the developing world on the agenda at Osaka, but the presidency rests with the Japanese and they have their own concerns and priorities.\" He added: \"We will be playing a leading role at Dakar. We see education as an absolutely vital development issue. We are committed to universal primary education by 2015.\" But the latest draft plan of action for Dakar reveals that the international community has failed to increase its funding for third world education. The plan, which does little more than state broad principles for action, has been dismissed by Oxfam, which describes it as an \"affront\" to the millions of children being denied the right to an education. \"This is precisely the sort of bureaucratic, half-baked thinking that threatens to turn the Dakar conference into high farce,\" said Mr Watkins. \"We are being asked to accept a plan of action that is devoid of funding commitments and lacking in any strategy for achieving universal basic education.\" According to Oxfam's global action plan, western countries would raise \u00a32.53bn in increased aid and debt relief to help third world schools, while developing countries would raise a similar amount through reducing military spending.

      "body": "<p>In 1900, curators from the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum took themselves to Paris to shop at the great Exposition Universelle held that year in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower and along the banks of the Seine. The V&amp;A team was not alone. More than 48m came to see the show that year. It was a marvel, featuring dual-speed travelators to take the millions around the expansive site and the African villages that with their exotic peoples and artworks inspired the young Pablo Picasso and Georges Braques. Cubism was on the way. </p> <p>But, what the V&amp;A team came to see and collect for their grand pantechnicon of the decorative arts back in South Kensington, that most Frenchified part of London, were examples of art nouveau design. As a result of their trip, the V&amp;A boasts one of the finest collections of art nouveau. This, and much more drawn from other collections, is about to go on show in what promises to be a superb blockbuster, Art Nouveau 1890-1914, curated by the V&amp;A's Paul Greenhalgh on its own highly decorative turf from April 6. </p> <p>The V&amp;A's role was important in the development of this florid, serpentine, self-consciously \"aesthetic\" style. We know that, among art nouveau designers, Emile Galle, Victor Horta and Odon Lechner visited the museum in search of inspiration. </p> <p>Art nouveau is loosely associated in British minds with Paris Metro entrances, the Biba fashion stores of 1970s London, and perhaps something to do with Oscar Wilde, absinthe, Aubrey Beardsley, lilies, sexy ladies writhing around lampstands and poor Ernest Dowson, the \"decadent\" poet whom everyone loved but of whom W B Yeats said he could imagine no world at any time in history in which Dowson would have been a success. </p> <p>In fact, art nouveau was an international phenomenon that raised its serpentine head in many of the great and, if not great, then industrious towns and cities of Europe, from Paris and Brussels, via Lille and Nancy, to Barcelona and then across to Turin, Venice and Vienna, back up through the Low Countries to Scandinavia and Finland.</p> <p> In Italy, the style was known as Stilo Liberty, in Austria and Germany as Jugendstijl, in Barcelona as Modernista. We can also include the styles known variously as National Romanticism in Scandinavia and, to a limited extent, Arts &amp; Crafts in Britain. There is, though, very little full-blooded indigenous art nouveau in Britain. Did I hear you sigh with relief? </p> <p>But, if you are inspired by the V&amp;A exhibition, where might you travel to see more? How can you pick from such a wide range of places? Let's make it easy(ish). Sit down for a glass of absinthe or ask for a weak hock and seltzer at the Black Friar, the delightfully unspoilt art &amp; crafts pub (H Fuller Clark, 1905) at 174 Queen Victoria Street near Blackfriars Station in the City of London. </p> <p>Suitably fortified, a bracing walk across the Thames will have you on board a Eurostar train bound for Paris and Brussels (and Nancy too) and on a long weekend's tour of art nouveau architecture. You will have seen the objets d'art at the V&amp;A. Now for the buildings. </p> <p>Don't worry. This tour doesn't have to be a marathon. It can be gently decadent. There is not a building coming up in the next few paragraphs that isn't within a louche slouch from a caf\u00e9 or bar. In fact you couldn't do better than taking coffee at the Caf\u00e9 Falstaff (E Houbion, 1903), 17-19 rue Henri Maus. </p> <p>Now you are within reasonably easy reach (no problems with public transport in Brussels) of some of the finest art nouveau houses of all. There's the Solvay House, 224 Avenue Louise, built between 1895 and 1900 to the design of Victor Horta. This is the art nouveau master's best house. Carriages once drove through the sinuous doors into the grand lobby where a top-lit stair ushered family and guests up into a suite of highly-decorated rooms, each last square millimetre worked over by the architect. A strange and impressive interior with its vegetable-like ironwork, pale orange and green paintwork, its swirling organic forms framed with a disciplined plan, the Solvay House is at the heart of art nouveau consciousness. </p> <p>Nearby, you'll find the more restrained, though equally impressive, Horta House, 23-25 rue Americaine (1898-1911), designed by the architect as his own home and studio. The dining room with its shiny white-glazed tiles (the sort we associate with Victorian public lavatories) and snaking ironwork is a very strange place to sit, more like a station waiting room than a place to eat en famille. Other Horta buildings are the Waucquez department store (1906) and the Van Eetvelde House (1895-97). </p> <p>Back to the station. But before boarding the Paris train, pass by the nutty Saint-Cyr House, 11 square Ambiorix (Gustave Strauven, 1900). Children like this one. It is four storeys high but just one bay wide, in other words very thin, and quite bonkers. Each floor is a visual riot of swirly-whirly ironwork and gloriously over the top detailing. Richer than a Belgian chocolate. </p> <p>Paris. Take the Metro to Porte Dauphine (1898-1901). This station has the best of the surviving art nouveau Metro entrances that were for many years taken for granted and have now all but disappeared. They were commissioned in 1896 from Hector Guimard, a disciple of Victor Horta. Each boasts snaky graphics, The Day the Earth Stood Still ironwork and glazed canopies that resemble butterfly wings. They are painted an if-you-go-down-to-the-woods-today green. Odd but utterly, 'ow you say, charming. </p> <p>Into town now for le shopping at, well, how about La Samaritaine, rue de la Monnaie, the great department store designed originally by Frantz Jourdain in art nouveau style in 1891-1907? This delightful courtyard building remains a pleasure to shop in, and you can climb to the roof for a view of tout Paris. Lots of twiddly ironwork. </p> <p>Yet, if it's importantly-earnest ironwork you seek after lunch, let me recommend you the superb offices of Le Parisien Lib\u00e9r\u00e9, 124 rue Reamur, (Georges Chedanne, 1903-4), a handsome pile of iron and glass with flourishes of art nouveau decadence in the upper floors. Pevsner would have said that this is a precursor of the Modern Movement. As for you, you shrug your shoulders, take a pastis and carry on unconcerned. Aux Parisiennes. </p> <p>If you had a spare couple of days, a serpentine TGV would speed you due east to Nancy and back. Here, there are many art nouveau villas, but these have the look of Gaudi more than Horta about them, and so are well worth the trip. Antoni Gaudi, secular patron saint of Barcelona, was one of the most original architects of all time. He was certainly no decadent and is rather a different decorative kettle of fish from the \"aesthetic\" art nouveau designers of France and Belgium. </p> <p>His influence in Nancy can be seen in the wonderful, Hansel-and-Gretel Villa Marjorelle, 1 rue Louis Marjorelle (Henri Sauvage, 1901-2). The Addams family would have loved it. The weird balconies waving from the body of the house, the witch's hat roofs, the tall, vegetable-like chimneys. The craftsmanship is superb. </p> <p>If you like houses with fairytale looks, don't fail to pass along rue des Brices. This is the Villa des Glycines (Emile Andre, 1902). Underneath the beetling brow of its deep eaves, it has eyes, a nose and a big nord-et-sud. The \"glycines\" or wisteria, by the way, grows up around either side of the big mouthed window like a pair of sweet-smelling moustaches. </p> <p> There are plenty more art nouveau houses in Nancy, and anyway it's good to have the excuse to stroll around a city that few tourists bother with. Just before we return to Paris, remember to pass by the Hermant House, 25 rue de Malzeville (Jacques-Ren\u00e9 Hermant, 1904) and the Villa Marguerite, 3 rue du Colonel-Renard (Gutton and Hornecker, 1905). </p> <p>Back in Britain, there just isn't much art nouveau to see. Architecture, I mean. There are a few oddities such as the Whitechapel Art Gallery (1899-1901), east London and the Horniman Museum (1896-1900), south-east London, both by Charles Harrison Townsend, but the interiors are muted even though what you'll see on show at both is never a disappointment. </p> <p>Back to the grand corridors and galleries of the V&amp;A. And dreams of future trips planned to perhaps Vienna (the works of Klimt, Olbrich, Hoffmann), Barcelona (Gaudi), Prague, Budapest, Moscow... The tentacles of art nouveau spread far and wide. Enough to keep those with a taste for Lalique, Daum Fr\u00e8res and Tiffany glass, Mucha posters, Hoffmann cutlery and chairs by the decidedly decadent Rupert Carabin deep in timetables and maps for the next few years. And should you, like so many Brits, find art nouveau a little hard on the eyes, a small tincture of the right stuff might help you to see its fronds and curls more kindly. Absinthe, after all, makes the heart grow fonder. </p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>Magic Cities (020 8728 7575) offers city breaks travelling on Eurostar.

A strange and impressive interior with its vegetable-like ironwork, pale orange and green paintwork, its swirling organic forms framed with a disciplined plan, the Solvay House is at the heart of art nouveau consciousness. Nearby, you'll find the more restrained, though equally impressive, Horta House, 23-25 rue Americaine (1898-1911), designed by the architect as his own home and studio. The dining room with its shiny white-glazed tiles (the sort we associate with Victorian public lavatories) and snaking ironwork is a very strange place to sit, more like a station waiting room than a place to eat en famille. Other Horta buildings are the Waucquez department store (1906) and the Van Eetvelde House (1895-97). Back to the station. But before boarding the Paris train, pass by the nutty Saint-Cyr House, 11 square Ambiorix (Gustave Strauven, 1900). Children like this one. It is four storeys high but just one bay wide, in other words very thin, and quite bonkers. Each floor is a visual riot of swirly-whirly ironwork and gloriously over the top detailing. Richer than a Belgian chocolate. Paris. Take the Metro to Porte Dauphine (1898-1901). This station has the best of the surviving art nouveau Metro entrances that were for many years taken for granted and have now all but disappeared. They were commissioned in 1896 from Hector Guimard, a disciple of Victor Horta. Each boasts snaky graphics, The Day the Earth Stood Still ironwork and glazed canopies that resemble butterfly wings. They are painted an if-you-go-down-to-the-woods-today green. Odd but utterly, 'ow you say, charming. Into town now for le shopping at, well, how about La Samaritaine, rue de la Monnaie, the great department store designed originally by Frantz Jourdain in art nouveau style in 1891-1907? This delightful courtyard building remains a pleasure to shop in, and you can climb to the roof for a view of tout Paris. Lots of twiddly ironwork. Yet, if it's importantly-earnest ironwork you seek after lunch, let me recommend you the superb offices of Le Parisien Lib\u00e9r\u00e9, 124 rue Reamur, (Georges Chedanne, 1903-4), a handsome pile of iron and glass with flourishes of art nouveau decadence in the upper floors. Pevsner would have said that this is a precursor of the Modern Movement. As for you, you shrug your shoulders, take a pastis and carry on unconcerned. Aux Parisiennes. If you had a spare couple of days, a serpentine TGV would speed you due east to Nancy and back. Here, there are many art nouveau villas, but these have the look of Gaudi more than Horta about them, and so are well worth the trip. Antoni Gaudi, secular patron saint of Barcelona, was one of the most original architects of all time. He was certainly no decadent and is rather a different decorative kettle of fish from the \"aesthetic\" art nouveau designers of France and Belgium. His influence in Nancy can be seen in the wonderful, Hansel-and-Gretel Villa Marjorelle, 1 rue Louis Marjorelle (Henri Sauvage, 1901-2). The Addams family would have loved it. The weird balconies waving from the body of the house, the witch's hat roofs, the tall, vegetable-like chimneys. The craftsmanship is superb. If you like houses with fairytale looks, don't fail to pass along rue des Brices. This is the Villa des Glycines (Emile Andre, 1902). Underneath the beetling brow of its deep eaves, it has eyes, a nose and a big nord-et-sud. The \"glycines\" or wisteria, by the way, grows up around either side of the big mouthed window like a pair of sweet-smelling moustaches. There are plenty more art nouveau houses in Nancy, and anyway it's good to have the excuse to stroll around a city that few tourists bother with. Just before we return to Paris, remember to pass by the Hermant House, 25 rue de Malzeville (Jacques-Ren\u00e9 Hermant, 1904) and the Villa Marguerite, 3 rue du Colonel-Renard (Gutton and Hornecker, 1905). Back in Britain, there just isn't much art nouveau to see. Architecture, I mean. There are a few oddities such as the Whitechapel Art Gallery (1899-1901), east London and the Horniman Museum (1896-1900), south-east London, both by Charles Harrison Townsend, but the interiors are muted even though what you'll see on show at both is never a disappointment. Back to the grand corridors and galleries of the V&amp;A. And dreams of future trips planned to perhaps Vienna (the works of Klimt, Olbrich, Hoffmann), Barcelona (Gaudi), Prague, Budapest, Moscow... The tentacles of art nouveau spread far and wide. Enough to keep those with a taste for Lalique, Daum Fr\u00e8res and Tiffany glass, Mucha posters, Hoffmann cutlery and chairs by the decidedly decadent Rupert Carabin deep in timetables and maps for the next few years. And should you, like so many Brits, find art nouveau a little hard on the eyes, a small tincture of the right stuff might help you to see its fronds and curls more kindly. Absinthe, after all, makes the heart grow fonder. The practicals Magic Cities (020 8728 7575) offers city breaks travelling on Eurostar. One night in Paris at the 3 star Hotel Veronese from \u00a399 (extra night \u00a320). One night in Brussels at the 3 star Van Belle from \u00a3115 (extra night \u00a325).",

      "body": "<p>Foodies and faddies have been fans for ages, but in the last few months organic produce has entered the mainstream diet in a big way. </p> <p>Where supermarkets once paid lip service to those who were thought of as cranky customers with a few knobbly organic carrots and undersized apples in their fruit and veg section, they are now giving over whole swathes of their sales area to chemical and additive-free food. </p> <p>Marks &amp; Spencer has introduced special sections, Sainsbury's reports a record \u00a32.8m sale of organic products each week and Tesco is shelling out \u00a3250,000 a year for four years to help fund the Aberdeen University Centre for Organic Culture while reporting a dramatic increase in pure food sales. </p> <p>Waitrose, in the meantime, can boast that it has once again been voted the Organic Supermarket of the year in the Soil Association's 1999 awards. </p> <p>The main complaint about organic food is the cost. It is more expensive than other produce because of specialist production. Organic crops are produced under strict European legislation and for a farm in this country to clear its land of pesticides under Soil Association regulations takes a two year transitional period and careful accreditation. Seventy per cent of organic food is still imported into Britain but this country is developing its own sources, especially in Scotland, where there are also organic fish farms. </p> <p>But cost is weighed against purity. Sustain, the Alliance for Better Food and Farming, says that a test found traces of 32 different agri-chemicals in apples. And there is also the matter of additives, suspect animal feed and the legacy of BSE and new variant CJD to consider. </p> <p>Another virtue of organic food which makes it attractive to those who buy with a conscience is that it is often produced by small suppliers. Organic foods mean that ethics can enter your shopping basket along with pure food. </p> <p>Fairtrade, whose aim is to get a better deal for Third World growers and producers, has under its banner a number of organic products, with the Hampstead Tea and Coffee Company's Darjeeling the winner of a Soil Association award. Fairtrade also markets organic cocoa, chocolate and honey. </p> <p>Waitrose, as a supermarket leader in the organic field, has more than 500 products in its stores, including pet foods, beers, wines, ciders, meat and fish, with such treats as organic brown trout. Tesco sources from registered growers and farmers. Its suppliers include Shipton Mill where wheat is traditionally stone-ground, Caledonian Brewery, which uses organic Scottish barley and organic hops from Kent and the Yeo Valley Organic Company, which is its principal yoghurt supplier. </p> <p>Sainsbury's has more than 500 lines and boasts a world first with its organic gin. The company is actively working towards an increase of organic production in Britain. It has established Sainsbury's Organic Resourcing Club and guarantees organic milk prices to farmers for the next five years to encourage them to convert their production. </p> <p>Sainsbury's also has the first all-organic supermarket in its Savacentre in Merton, south London. Another knock-on effect of buying organic is that the movement is a likely saviour for many small farms which would otherwise go out of business - they can supply to small and large outlets alike. </p> <p>The newest trend in fresh food is a re-emergence of direct farm selling to towns and inner cities with farmers' markets. Agriculture minister Nick Brown opened London's fourth farmer's market at Camden Lock earlier this month and Wheatland Famers' Markets Ltd (020-7704-9659) which runs them, is looking at sites in Windsor, Wimbledon, Battersea, Blackheath and Greenwich. The other three which are up and running are in Islington, Swiss Cottage and Notting Hill Gate. </p> <p>Spokeswoman Nina Planck says: \"Organic food is not a fad, but here to stay. Our markets sell organic pork, beef, lamb and veal, organic bread and free-range eggs from producers who are in the process of converting. We are making it possible for small farmers to carry on. There are 3,000 farmers' markets in America where they have tripled farm incomes.\" </p> <p>Wheatlands limits stalls to farms from within 100 miles of the M25 and inspects every farm which signs up with them. Not everything in a farmers' market is necessarily organic, but the movement, which has seen 150 sites open in Britain, aims to promote chemical-free produce and reduce the hefty import sector. </p> <p>Specialist organic suppliers Abel &amp; Cole (0171-737-5217) have delivered organic fruit and vegetables to London doorsteps for nearly six years. \"We started with potatoes 11 years ago,\" says Paul Cole, \"and our customers started asking for other produce. Customers have an input and there is a direct link between the households and the farms.\" </p> <p>Abel &amp; Cole can also deliver a limited range to other parts of the country. Its boxes start at \u00a37 and can be tailored to individual needs. For \u00a310.50 you will get cauliflower, red cabbage, carrots, celery, tomatoes, aubergines, courgettes, pink radish, lettuce and herbs. They also supply eggs, fruit juice, olive oil, meat and poultry, among other things, to homes in the Greater London area. Their website is <a href=\"http://www.abel-cole.co.uk\">www.abel-cole.co.uk</a> and it will go interactive soon. </p> <p>SimplyOrg@nic, the UK's largest home delivery organic supermarket, offers buying by telephone, fax, post, e-mail or internet with a daily updated interactive website, <a href=\"http://www.simplyorganic.net\">www.simplyorganic.net</a>, tel: 0845-100-444. The company sells everything you would expect in a mainstream supermarket - meat, certified by the Organic Farmers and Growers Association, fish, fruit and vegetables, dairy products, groceries, baby food and even toiletries. It also does wines, beers and spirits. Food is delivered to your door in special chilled boxes. </p> <p>For example, a chicken weighing around 1.7kg costs on average \u00a311.19, Cumberland sausages in 500g packs of eight cost \u00a35.29 and sliced smoked ham is \u00a32.79 for 250g. Organic smoked salmon is \u00a36.99 for 200g, black bream fillets in a pack of two are \u00a34.99, a pack of two red mullet fillets is \u00a35.99, while a vegetable box with eight varieties weighing three to four kilos will cost around \u00a38.99. </p> <p>Organic baby food costs around 65p to \u00a31.09 a jar and there are environmentally friendly baby toiletries and nappies. Toiletries include organic toothpaste at \u00a32.99 for 50ml, shampoo at \u00a33.99 for 200ml and conditioner at the same price. </p> <p>Another virtue of buying organic food is animal welfare. Animals and poultry reared for organic meat are reared naturally and not subjected to factory farming methods or pumped full of antibiotics and growth hormones. But take note: free-range does not necessarily mean organic and foods labelled \"in conversion\" are not fully organic, but come from suppliers who are in the process of getting Soil Association accreditation.</p>",

Marks &amp; Spencer has introduced special sections, Sainsbury's reports a record \u00a32.8m sale of organic products each week and Tesco is shelling out \u00a3250,000 a year for four years to help fund the Aberdeen University Centre for Organic Culture while reporting a dramatic increase in pure food sales. Waitrose, in the meantime, can boast that it has once again been voted the Organic Supermarket of the year in the Soil Association's 1999 awards. The main complaint about organic food is the cost. It is more expensive than other produce because of specialist production. Organic crops are produced under strict European legislation and for a farm in this country to clear its land of pesticides under Soil Association regulations takes a two year transitional period and careful accreditation. Seventy per cent of organic food is still imported into Britain but this country is developing its own sources, especially in Scotland, where there are also organic fish farms. But cost is weighed against purity. Sustain, the Alliance for Better Food and Farming, says that a test found traces of 32 different agri-chemicals in apples. And there is also the matter of additives, suspect animal feed and the legacy of BSE and new variant CJD to consider. Another virtue of organic food which makes it attractive to those who buy with a conscience is that it is often produced by small suppliers. Organic foods mean that ethics can enter your shopping basket along with pure food. Fairtrade, whose aim is to get a better deal for Third World growers and producers, has under its banner a number of organic products, with the Hampstead Tea and Coffee Company's Darjeeling the winner of a Soil Association award. Fairtrade also markets organic cocoa, chocolate and honey. Waitrose, as a supermarket leader in the organic field, has more than 500 products in its stores, including pet foods, beers, wines, ciders, meat and fish, with such treats as organic brown trout. Tesco sources from registered growers and farmers. Its suppliers include Shipton Mill where wheat is traditionally stone-ground, Caledonian Brewery, which uses organic Scottish barley and organic hops from Kent and the Yeo Valley Organic Company, which is its principal yoghurt supplier. Sainsbury's has more than 500 lines and boasts a world first with its organic gin. The company is actively working towards an increase of organic production in Britain. It has established Sainsbury's Organic Resourcing Club and guarantees organic milk prices to farmers for the next five years to encourage them to convert their production. Sainsbury's also has the first all-organic supermarket in its Savacentre in Merton, south London. Another knock-on effect of buying organic is that the movement is a likely saviour for many small farms which would otherwise go out of business - they can supply to small and large outlets alike. The newest trend in fresh food is a re-emergence of direct farm selling to towns and inner cities with farmers' markets. Agriculture minister Nick Brown opened London's fourth farmer's market at Camden Lock earlier this month and Wheatland Famers' Markets Ltd (020-7704-9659) which runs them, is looking at sites in Windsor, Wimbledon, Battersea, Blackheath and Greenwich. The other three which are up and running are in Islington, Swiss Cottage and Notting Hill Gate. Spokeswoman Nina Planck says: \"Organic food is not a fad, but here to stay. Our markets sell organic pork, beef, lamb and veal, organic bread and free-range eggs from producers who are in the process of converting. We are making it possible for small farmers to carry on. There are 3,000 farmers' markets in America where they have tripled farm incomes.\" Wheatlands limits stalls to farms from within 100 miles of the M25 and inspects every farm which signs up with them. Not everything in a farmers' market is necessarily organic, but the movement, which has seen 150 sites open in Britain, aims to promote chemical-free produce and reduce the hefty import sector. Specialist organic suppliers Abel &amp; Cole (0171-737-5217) have delivered organic fruit and vegetables to London doorsteps for nearly six years. \"We started with potatoes 11 years ago,\" says Paul Cole, \"and our customers started asking for other produce. Customers have an input and there is a direct link between the households and the farms.\" Abel &amp; Cole can also deliver a limited range to other parts of the country. Its boxes start at \u00a37 and can be tailored to individual needs. For \u00a310.50 you will get cauliflower, red cabbage, carrots, celery, tomatoes, aubergines, courgettes, pink radish, lettuce and herbs. They also supply eggs, fruit juice, olive oil, meat and poultry, among other things, to homes in the Greater London area. Their website is www.abel-cole.co.uk and it will go interactive soon. SimplyOrg@nic, the UK's largest home delivery organic supermarket, offers buying by telephone, fax, post, e-mail or internet with a daily updated interactive website, www.simplyorganic.net, tel: 0845-100-444. The company sells everything you would expect in a mainstream supermarket - meat, certified by the Organic Farmers and Growers Association, fish, fruit and vegetables, dairy products, groceries, baby food and even toiletries. It also does wines, beers and spirits. Food is delivered to your door in special chilled boxes. For example, a chicken weighing around 1.7kg costs on average \u00a311.19, Cumberland sausages in 500g packs of eight cost \u00a35.29 and sliced smoked ham is \u00a32.79 for 250g. Organic smoked salmon is \u00a36.99 for 200g, black bream fillets in a pack of two are \u00a34.99, a pack of two red mullet fillets is \u00a35.99, while a vegetable box with eight varieties weighing three to four kilos will cost around \u00a38.99. Organic baby food costs around 65p to \u00a31.09 a jar and there are environmentally friendly baby toiletries and nappies. Toiletries include organic toothpaste at \u00a32.99 for 50ml, shampoo at \u00a33.99 for 200ml and conditioner at the same price. Another virtue of buying organic food is animal welfare. Animals and poultry reared for organic meat are reared naturally and not subjected to factory farming methods or pumped full of antibiotics and growth hormones. But take note: free-range does not necessarily mean organic and foods labelled \"in conversion\" are not fully organic, but come from suppliers who are in the process of getting Soil Association accreditation.",

      "trailText": "<p>Philip Seymour Hoffman is that rare thing: a Hollywood actor who delivers remarkable performances without ever stealing the show. Nisha Gopalan searches for his soul</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Philip Seymour Hoffman is ready for his close-up. But you might not be ready to look. He wants you to stare deep into his eyes, past his pupils, through his brain, until you've voyeuristically met his id. If Freud were around to witness this, he would be baffled: \"Was he breast-fed? Is he gay? Aha! His mother was a feminist.\" </p> <p>The actor has earned a reputation for his astounding capacity to evoke adolescent-like confusion. From the chubby, closeted crew guy who clumsily puts the moves on Mark Wahlberg's God-like porn star in Boogie Nights (\"Can I kiss you on the mouth?\" he splutters, in one of the film's most acutely awkward moments), to the lonely lech with a weakness for crank-calling in Happiness, his characters always manage to get it wrong. \"He'll say the unsayable, and do the unthinkable,\" director Joel Schumacher once commented about the actor. \"And he'll take the consequences.\" You pity and cringe at Hoffman like you would at an unassuming chump in a horror film who's about to meet his demise. Then, to make matters worse, when he does buckle to the circumstances -shamefully retracting his homosexual lust in Boogie Nights, unexpectedly confronted by the object of his stalking in Happiness - he does it so quietly.</p> <p>His rare talent hasn't gone unnoticed, and in this past year Hoffman has transformed himself into one of the hardest-working men in the entertainment industry. </p> <p>On screen, he's managed to work with an enviable selection of directors - and he's notable for being one of the leading lights of the Paul Thomas Anderson (Hard Eight, Boogie Nights, Magnolia) posse, along with the equally talented John C Reilly, Philip Baker Hall and Melora Walters. \"I've tried to do roles of all stripes that keep the work coming and me interested,\" Hoffman has said, and the diverse crop of roles he's chosen this year is no exception to that rule. He's the Ivy League asshole Freddie, digging jazz with Jude Law in Rome while being privy to Matt Damon's fa\u008dade in Anthony Minghella's The Talented Mr Ripley. He steals the show as a melodramatic drag queen with </p> <p>X-ray vision into Robert De Niro's soul in Schumacher's Flawless. He offsets Tom Cruise's grandiose self-help guru by playing a stable hospital caretaker in Magnolia. And he'll soon be entering the world of rock'n'roll in the upcoming Cameron Crowe project. </p> <p>Aside from directing his first play, the off-Broadway In Arabia, We'd All Be Kings, he can also be seen on stage in New York at present, starring opposite Magnolia co-star and longtime friend John C Reilly in True West. It's a black comedy by Sam Shepard about two brothers - a self-important screenwriter and a small-time thief - who duke out their differences. (With what most actors would regard as pure masochism, as well as being testament to a broad range, Hoffman will periodically switch roles with his co-star.) At the end of this performance, where he's played the straight-laced yuppie, Hoffman is ragged with sweat, his breath short and his hair messy. While he takes a bow, his spent face stares blindly into the audience. He looks like a deer caught in headlights, or, more appropriately, like a deer who's just been hit by a car and is gazing back at the driver in disbelief. \"That's what I get for purging my soul?\" he seems to be thinking, \"Applause?\" </p> <p>This chameleon-like actor deserves an Academy award for his troubles - though he's unlikely ever to get one. His talent of magnificently understating even the most sensational character is his Achilles heel.

(Yes, he's straight.)

      "bodyText": "Philip Seymour Hoffman is ready for his close-up. But you might not be ready to look. He wants you to stare deep into his eyes, past his pupils, through his brain, until you've voyeuristically met his id. If Freud were around to witness this, he would be baffled: \"Was he breast-fed? Is he gay? Aha! His mother was a feminist.\" The actor has earned a reputation for his astounding capacity to evoke adolescent-like confusion. From the chubby, closeted crew guy who clumsily puts the moves on Mark Wahlberg's God-like porn star in Boogie Nights (\"Can I kiss you on the mouth?\" he splutters, in one of the film's most acutely awkward moments), to the lonely lech with a weakness for crank-calling in Happiness, his characters always manage to get it wrong. \"He'll say the unsayable, and do the unthinkable,\" director Joel Schumacher once commented about the actor. \"And he'll take the consequences.\" You pity and cringe at Hoffman like you would at an unassuming chump in a horror film who's about to meet his demise. Then, to make matters worse, when he does buckle to the circumstances -shamefully retracting his homosexual lust in Boogie Nights, unexpectedly confronted by the object of his stalking in Happiness - he does it so quietly. His rare talent hasn't gone unnoticed, and in this past year Hoffman has transformed himself into one of the hardest-working men in the entertainment industry. On screen, he's managed to work with an enviable selection of directors - and he's notable for being one of the leading lights of the Paul Thomas Anderson (Hard Eight, Boogie Nights, Magnolia) posse, along with the equally talented John C Reilly, Philip Baker Hall and Melora Walters. \"I've tried to do roles of all stripes that keep the work coming and me interested,\" Hoffman has said, and the diverse crop of roles he's chosen this year is no exception to that rule. He's the Ivy League asshole Freddie, digging jazz with Jude Law in Rome while being privy to Matt Damon's fa\u008dade in Anthony Minghella's The Talented Mr Ripley. He steals the show as a melodramatic drag queen with X-ray vision into Robert De Niro's soul in Schumacher's Flawless. He offsets Tom Cruise's grandiose self-help guru by playing a stable hospital caretaker in Magnolia. And he'll soon be entering the world of rock'n'roll in the upcoming Cameron Crowe project. Aside from directing his first play, the off-Broadway In Arabia, We'd All Be Kings, he can also be seen on stage in New York at present, starring opposite Magnolia co-star and longtime friend John C Reilly in True West. It's a black comedy by Sam Shepard about two brothers - a self-important screenwriter and a small-time thief - who duke out their differences. (With what most actors would regard as pure masochism, as well as being testament to a broad range, Hoffman will periodically switch roles with his co-star.) At the end of this performance, where he's played the straight-laced yuppie, Hoffman is ragged with sweat, his breath short and his hair messy. While he takes a bow, his spent face stares blindly into the audience. He looks like a deer caught in headlights, or, more appropriately, like a deer who's just been hit by a car and is gazing back at the driver in disbelief. \"That's what I get for purging my soul?\" he seems to be thinking, \"Applause?\" This chameleon-like actor deserves an Academy award for his troubles - though he's unlikely ever to get one. His talent of magnificently understating even the most sensational character is his Achilles heel. He'll take that contrived speech and meld it so well into the scene that you'll never know what hit you. Tom Cruise can't do that. Tom Cruise has an Oscar nomination. Remember Hoffman in Scent Of A Woman? In Twister? In The Big Lebowski? That's the point. It's only when you link these background performances together that you realise just how good he is.

      "body": "<p>Poetry is an art which depends on solitary reflection. The relationship between a poem and its reader is always one-to-one, even when that poem is being recited to a room full of people. We receive it individually, interpret it through the filter of our own individual memories and expectations, and recognise its power as being inseparable from our deep feelings. Indeed, poems are a hot-line to our hearts, and we forget this emotional power at our peril.</p> <p>I remember being impressed by this in the days after Princess Diana was killed. Like many, I went to gaze at that lake of flowers outside Kensington Palace and I was struck by how many thousands of the bouquets had verses attached . The same thing happened months later, when flowers in memory of those killed by the Soho bomb were laid out in Soho Square. Almost all those flowers were also accompanied by a poem. Most, to be frank, were not really literature, but that isn't the point. The point is: in distress, people had turned to poetry because they felt that it allowed them to express their feelings in a way that prose could not. The same thing happens at moments of intense pleasure and celebration as well - when we fall in love, when we get married, and so on.</p> <p>Poetry is sanctified by a sense that it helps us to enjoy and endure our existence. It stretches our humanity - not just in the sense that it tells truth to power, and deepens our knowledge of the human condition, but in the sense that it can have an actually liberalising effect on our natures.</p> <p>Liberalising how? Think of Shakespeare. Shakespeare never comes to the front of the stage and wags his finger at us, telling us what to think. His characters dramatise good and evil, folly and wisdom, foresight and expediency. We are always being put on the spot, invited to make decisions and distinctions, having to choose between what is sensible and what is unworkable. This is why Keats loved him so much, and what Keats referred to when he said in one of his letters: \"Axioms in philosophy are not axioms unless they are proved upon our pulses.\" He meant that writers can tell us what is right and what is wrong until they are blue in the face; we will only believe them when we feel it.</p> <p>Public poetry is poetry about an event or a person (or people) of general interest. Famous examples would be Tennyson's Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington, or his Charge of the Light Brigade:</p> <p>When can their glory fade?<br> O the wild charge they made!<br> All the world wonder'd.<br> Honour the charge they made!<br> Honour the Light Brigade, <br>Noble six hundred!</p> <p>But when we ask ourselves what makes these poems public, and whether their public element has something to do with the fact that Tennyson wrote them when he was Poet Laureate, things immediately get more complicated.</p> <p>After all, Tennyson wrote a great deal of other kinds of poetry when he was Laureate and many of these are not public in anything like the same sense. It is the language of the Ode and of the Charge which defines their publicness as much as their subject. Something in the language which has to do with their being written for a largely sympathetic audience; something to do with their apprehension of national values; and something to do with their sense of what is heroic and fine.</p> <p>The Charge is, in a way, a war poem, but one with very different aims from war poems by Wilfred Owen or Siegfried Sassoon. Where the language of Tennyson's poem is consensual, and feels confident that it shares the thoughts and attitudes of the vast majority of its readers, the language of Owen's and Sassoon's work is not. While their poems do most certainly express a generally-held loathing of war and suffering, they do so in ways which are hostile to authority and which seek to tear the veils of ignorance from the eyes of those who had no idea about the reality of life in the trenches. Their refusal to make large rhetorical gestures is a part of this adversarial spirit. They deliberately avoid using a language which smacks of broadly-based public discourse, because that language has been tainted by those who use it to deceive the public.</p> <p>Listen to the chastening modesties of Owen's The Send Off: </p> <p>Down the close darkening lanes they sang their way<br> To the siding-shed,<br> And lined the train with faces grimly gay. </p> <p>Their breasts were struck all white with wreath and spray<br> As men's are, dead...</p> <p>... Shall they return to beatings of great bells<br> In wild train-loads?<br> A few, a few, too few for drums and yells,</p> <p> May creep back, silent, to still village wells,<br> Up half-known roads.</p> <p>The great poets of the first world war destroyed hard-core Victorian public poetry, sealing it in its own world, and making it difficult for later offshoots, Kipling's poetry, to lead a secure life. But their strategies were not entirely new. Their satires and polemics owed a great deal to previous satirists and polemicists - to members of the Victorian awkward-squad, to the Augustans before them, and back through history.</p> <p>And as we notice this, we want to say the same thing about successful satires which have been produced in our own time. About Tony Harrison's V, or certain poems by Wendy Cope, or others by Philip Larkin. Satire creates as clear-cut a relationship with its audience as Tennyson does in a poem like the Charge.</p> <p>Owen and Sassoon helped create a kind of public writing we still recognise today, and this involved a vitally adversarial spirit. But this spirit can and must express itself within poems by doing more than openly attacking enemies and disbelievers. The example of John Keats will help show what I mean. We're accustomed to the idea that the young Wordsworth and the young Coleridge were radically dissenting figures, so much so that at one time they were suspected of being spies for the French. We know, too, that Shelley was a firebrand all the days of his short life. We know about William Blake.</p> <p>But generally speaking we've been brought up to think of Keats as an odd man out. While his contemporaries struggled to turn themselves into unacknowledged legislators in the liberal cause, he flopped around on beds of lilies, panting luxuriously, dreaming about sex or death or both together.</p> <p>But the time-honoured views of Keats's genius completely miss the point about how his work engages with the real world of politics and public affairs. It's easy to see why. Think of Shelley's great poem, The Mask of Anarchy, with its unforgettable and unforgotten attack on Castlereagh. We see at once that we are dealing with a public poem of the most passionate and overt kind:</p> <p>I met Murder on the way - <br>He had a mask like Castlereagh -<br> Very smooth he looked, yet grim;<br> Seven blood-hounds followed him:<br> All were fat; and well they might<br> Be in admirable plight, <br>For one by one, and two by two, <br>He tossed them human hearts to chew<br> Which from his wide cloak he drew.</p> <p>One year later, in 1820, Keats wrote To Autumn, a poem which has often been taken as proof of how escapist its author was - how he refused to have anything to do with the various oppressions and cruelties that Shelley savages in the Mask. But if we trace Keats's involvement with liberal politics through his early friendship with radicals like Leigh Hunt, and remember that To Autumn was written in the aftermath of the Peterloo Massacre, shortly after Keats had seen the dissenting orator Henry Hunt making his triumphant entry into London, we might be more willing to look for signs of its public sympathies and involvements. Sympathies which were triggered, not just by outbursts of repressive violence like the massacre itself, but by the long-serving Tory government's campaign to secure a regime of prejudice and disastrous inequality - one which included the repeated suspension of habeus corpus. Here's the last verse:</p> <p>Where are the songs of Spring?<br> Ay, where are they?<br> Think not of them, thou hast thy music too - <br>While barred clouds bloom the soft dying day,<br> And touch the stubble plains with rosy hue:<br> Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn<br> Among the river sallows, borne aloft<br> Or sinking as the light wind lives and dies; <br> And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourne; <br>Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft <br>The red-breast whistles from a garden-croft;<br> And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.</p> <p>In the previous two stanzas of the poem, we've been shown a landscape which is so tense and bulging with fruitfulness, it's only a fraction short of becoming rotten. And also one in which certain living things have to keep up a ferocious workrate (I'm thinking of the bees and those \"more /And still more, later flowers\"). In the same way, what we have in these 10 lines is a picture of abundance which is profoundly troubled and troubling: the day is \"soft-dying\", admittedly, but it is dying; the gnats are \"mournful\"; the lambs and the robin are only days away from winter, and the swallows - well, the swallows are about to leave the country, just as Keats's brother George had recently emigrated to America to escape what Keats referred to in one of his letters as the \"burden\" of contemporary politics.</p> <p>What we have in To Autumn is a poem which is self-evidently unlike the kind we find Shelley writing in The Mask of Anarchy. It is a poem which registers the pressure and shock of its contemporary moment, and is full of anxiety and foreboding - but which transmutes those feelings into organic and pastoral terms. It is, in its refractions and assimilations, profoundly conscious of public life, and we do it a great disservice if we are not alive to this ingredient and intention.</p> <p>I want to give one more example of this kind of double-level writing. Edward Thomas, who incidentally wrote a very good book about Keats, was killed at the Battle of Arras in April 1917, but virtually all his poems were written during the time he spent in England between enlisting and crossing the Channel. When we read him, we should not expect to find descriptions of trenches and mud and slaughter . But does this make him any less of a war poet than Owen or Sassoon?</p> <p>Not in my book it doesn't. It means that we are conscious of the war in his work in much the same way that we are conscious of contemporary politics in Keats. As an example, here is the beginning of the poem The Sun Used to Shine, written in May 1916, in which Thomas remembers a walk that he took with his friend, the American poet Robert Frost, through the fields near Ledbury in Gloucestershire:</p> <p>The sun used to shine while we two walked<br> Slowly together, paused and started <br>Again, and sometimes mused, sometimes talked<br> As either pleased, and, cheerfully parted</p> <p> Each night. We never disagreed <br>Which gate to rest on. The to be <br>And the late past we gave small heed.<br> We turned from men or poetry</p> <p> To rumours of the war remote <br>Only till both stood disinclined<br> For aught but the yellow flavorous coat <br>Of an apple wasps had undermined;<br> Or a sentry of dark betonies,<br> The stateliest of small flowers on earth,<br> At the forest verge; or crocuses<br> Pale purple as if they had their birth<br> In sunless Hades fields.</p> <p>The war, though \"remote\", shows up more clearly here than the Peterloo Massacre does in Keats's \"To Autumn\". But the same imaginative principle applies in both poems. Like Keats, Thomas feels the weight of a particular public moment, and rather than addressing it directly, he responds in a way which is resolutely personal, transformative and sensuous. He rises to the challenge of the instant, but seeks out general truths and durable verities. For these reasons, we would do well to think of Keats and Thomas, and of other poets who work in the same way, as \"active\" poets rather than \"reactive\" ones.</p> <p>Instead of Tennyson's direct assault on a subject, we have a layered approach; instead of heroic types, we have wary individuals; instead of a ringingly centered language, we have highly personalised voices. What is public in Thomas has nothing to do with plinths and trumpets.</p> <p>I wrote my graduate thesis on Edward Thomas 25 years ago, and ever since then he has remained an exemplary figure for me. As, of course, has Keats. But while it would be true to say that they are in my mind most days, they have lived in me even more vividly and vigorously since I was appointed Poet Laureate, and have deeply influenced the ways that I have thought about writing public poems. Tennyson is the Laureate I most admire and his Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington opens:</p> <p>Bury the Great Duke<br> With an empire's lamentation, <br>Let us bury the Great Duke<br> To the noise of the mourning of a mighty nation, <br>Mourning when their leaders fall, <br>Warriors carry the warrior's pall, <br> And sorrow darkens hamlet and hall.</p> <p>Tennyson had a sure sense of what was established and inviolable in his world. Grieving for what he calls elsewhere in the poem the \"foremost captain of his time\" he hears the sound of not just a \"nation weeping\", but of a whole empire, and does his best to articulate mass-sorrow in an appropriately booming language. The authority of the poem depends on his having no doubts about the rightness of this. It leaves no cracks in its structure through which questions about Wellington's politics might appear, or scepticism about the state's motives when it sent him on his various campaigns, or anxiety about the existence and operation of empire itself.</p> <p>Wellington is a straight up and down hero - the latest in a distinguished line. God, we deduce, really must be an Englishman if he can see Wellington's worth so accurately:</p> <p>He is gone who seem'd so great - <br>Gone; but nothing can bereave him <br>Of the force he made his own <br>Being here, and we believe him <br>Something far advanced in State,<br> And that he wears a truer crown <br>Than any wreath that man can weave him.<br> Speak no more of his renown,<br> Lay your earthly fancies down, <br>And in the vast cathedral leave him. <br>God accept him, Christ receive him</p> <p> It's easy to mock this kind of thing. Its rhetoric drowns out the questions we would like to raise. This is why I refer to it as a hardcore public poem. Even if Tennyson knew that he lived in a society made up of different societies. he didn't have any hesitation in speaking \"for the nation\" when the occasion demanded it. But what is a poet to do today when invited to respond to a \"national occasion\"?</p> <p>It is a commonplace, but one worth repeating, to say that much of the delight we take in our contemporary society has to do with its diversity. This is absolutely not to say \"there is no such thing as society\", but to insist on its many facets, faiths, components and interests. There was a good deal of discussion about this last May, around the time of my appointment as Laureate. How can any one poet, a person who inevitably has a certain background, attitude, and take on the world, be expected to speak for everybody in their country? How can they avoid missing out on large sections of the community? Can they escape becoming a stooge of royalty or the government? How can they seem properly inclusive without becoming bland?</p> <p>At the outset, I told myself that I had been appointed because I had written what I had written - and that I should resist any pressures to turn myself into a different kind of writer. That's to say I knew that I was a personal kind of poet, and felt that I should therefore respond to occasions in a personal way: as a private citizen, putting my work into a public space without any illusions that I would necessarily echo universally-held thoughts and opinions.</p> <p>This decision has had at least three consequences. One, obviously, is to do with tone - my determination to continue using the same sort of speaking voice that I have always used. One is to do with the subjects themselves - my decision to honour the tradition of writing poems about events in the royal calendar but to make such poems part of a larger pattern of writing about other kinds of public event. And one is to do with approach - with that willingness I admire in Keats and Thomas - to look around or beyond a specific event.</p> <p>I'm not trying to suggest that I want to shy away from the reality of these events, rather that I want to engage with them, while at the same time remaining alert to their general, symbolic or even allegorical values. The poem I wrote for the wedding of Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys Jones is one which wants to remind its readers of the questions which preoccupy all people in love and getting married: will the things we say today last into the future, how will we cope with our changing selves?</p> <p>In the same spirit, the poem I wrote for the TUC, in spite of their good-natured suggestion that I should concentrate on international trade relations, was about individual liberty. The poem I wrote about the Paddington rail disaster focuses on that tragedy, but refers to other kinds of bereavements and brutal severings. So too, in the poem I wrote about the millennium, I was concerned with the unceasing flow of time rather than the jerk of a minute-hand at one specific moment.</p> <p>And in the poem about bullying that I wrote for the charity Childline, printed in this newspaper last week, I tried to draw broad conclusions from a specific instance. If I had written any of these poems in another way, I'm certain that I would have been lured into writing to order, into dittying, or into thinking too precisely on the event for the good of the poem. In every case I had a phrase from Keats's letters resonating in my head: \"We hate poetry that has a palpable design on us.\"</p> <p>Andrew Marvell's Horatian Ode upon Cromwell's Return from Ireland goes about its public business in ways that seem to me exemplary. Although not in any sense a publicly-funded poem, its rare qualities nevertheless vitalise those issues of freedom and choice which have been my constant refrain.</p> <p>Marvell has been given a certain amount of stick for seeming in two minds about almost everything. TS Eliot, famously, called him a \"lukewarm partisan\" and it's certainly true that there is something elusive about Marvell's character, and something in his work that we slide off, however much we admire it. Think of all those little sealed entities he gives us in his lyric poems - the drops of dew and the thrush's eyes. Their high polish makes it difficult for us to get a purchase, in the same way that their circularity seems to exclude us.</p> <p>In the Horatian Ode, we are not so much held at arm's length as impelled to share a balanced opinion. The poem was probably written in 1650, shortly after Cromwell had returned from his campaign in Ireland and before he began his campaign in Scotland - a campaign which his Lieutenant-General, Fairfax, refused to lead. Because Marvell later worked as the tutor to Fairfax's daughter at Nun Appleton House in Yorkshire, it's often supposed that the poem's point of view is not really Marvell's at all, but his future employer's. In fact there is no evidence to suggest that Marvell even knew Fairfax when he wrote the poem. Its balance is entirely his own, and entirely characteristic.</p> <p>As a matter of hard fact, Marvell in 1650 regarded Cromwell as someone whose private life was beyond reproach but whose policies were Machiavellian. In the poem, he offers us Cromwell as a man without personal ambition who is bent on upholding an ideal of impartial justice.</p> <p>Though justice against fate complain,<br> And plead the ancient rights in vain: <br>But those do hold or break<br> As men are strong or weak.</p> <p>There is, of course, a way of reading this which would make Marvell seem credulous. But in truth the power of the poem lies in its detachment - detachment which is most clearly on show in the celebrated lines describing the execution of Charles I:</p> <p>He nothing common did or mean<br> Upon that memorable scene:<br> But with his keener eye <br>The axe's edge did try: <br>Nor called the Gods with vulgar spite <br>To vindicate his helpless Right, <br>But bowed his comely head <br>Down as upon a bed.</p> <p>As Cromwell's unofficial Laureate, Marvell deals brilliantly with the question of how to address public issues in a way which is at once engaged and independent. Living through a time of revolutionary change, he does not respond as a propagandist for one side or another, but as someone bearing witness to interior realities.</p> <p>This is the quality that needs to be defended in public writing: the ability to stand outside an event, even to transform it, while registering its pressures and importance. It is the quality I especially admire in Keats - and not only Keats. Matthew Arnold, who thought more deeply about the nature and role of public art than most, also reminds us of Marvellian virtues when he tells us that during periods of turbulence and rapid change, artists should avoid the temptation to \"lend a hand at uprooting certain definite evils\". The point is not that writers or artists of any kind should hide their heads in the sand, but that they have the opportunity to take a longer and larger view. A view of events within time, and within the flux of the self. </p> <p>\u0095 This is an edited extract from a speech given by Andrew Motion at the Royal Society of Arts this week</p>",

      "bodyText": "Poetry is an art which depends on solitary reflection. The relationship between a poem and its reader is always one-to-one, even when that poem is being recited to a room full of people. We receive it individually, interpret it through the filter of our own individual memories and expectations, and recognise its power as being inseparable from our deep feelings. Indeed, poems are a hot-line to our hearts, and we forget this emotional power at our peril. I remember being impressed by this in the days after Princess Diana was killed. Like many, I went to gaze at that lake of flowers outside Kensington Palace and I was struck by how many thousands of the bouquets had verses attached . The same thing happened months later, when flowers in memory of those killed by the Soho bomb were laid out in Soho Square. Almost all those flowers were also accompanied by a poem. Most, to be frank, were not really literature, but that isn't the point. The point is: in distress, people had turned to poetry because they felt that it allowed them to express their feelings in a way that prose could not. The same thing happens at moments of intense pleasure and celebration as well - when we fall in love, when we get married, and so on. Poetry is sanctified by a sense that it helps us to enjoy and endure our existence. It stretches our humanity - not just in the sense that it tells truth to power, and deepens our knowledge of the human condition, but in the sense that it can have an actually liberalising effect on our natures. Liberalising how? Think of Shakespeare. Shakespeare never comes to the front of the stage and wags his finger at us, telling us what to think. His characters dramatise good and evil, folly and wisdom, foresight and expediency. We are always being put on the spot, invited to make decisions and distinctions, having to choose between what is sensible and what is unworkable. This is why Keats loved him so much, and what Keats referred to when he said in one of his letters: \"Axioms in philosophy are not axioms unless they are proved upon our pulses.\" He meant that writers can tell us what is right and what is wrong until they are blue in the face; we will only believe them when we feel it. Public poetry is poetry about an event or a person (or people) of general interest. Famous examples would be Tennyson's Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington, or his Charge of the Light Brigade: When can their glory fade? O the wild charge they made! All the world wonder'd. Honour the charge they made! Honour the Light Brigade, Noble six hundred! But when we ask ourselves what makes these poems public, and whether their public element has something to do with the fact that Tennyson wrote them when he was Poet Laureate, things immediately get more complicated. After all, Tennyson wrote a great deal of other kinds of poetry when he was Laureate and many of these are not public in anything like the same sense. It is the language of the Ode and of the Charge which defines their publicness as much as their subject. Something in the language which has to do with their being written for a largely sympathetic audience; something to do with their apprehension of national values; and something to do with their sense of what is heroic and fine. The Charge is, in a way, a war poem, but one with very different aims from war poems by Wilfred Owen or Siegfried Sassoon. Where the language of Tennyson's poem is consensual, and feels confident that it shares the thoughts and attitudes of the vast majority of its readers, the language of Owen's and Sassoon's work is not. While their poems do most certainly express a generally-held loathing of war and suffering, they do so in ways which are hostile to authority and which seek to tear the veils of ignorance from the eyes of those who had no idea about the reality of life in the trenches. Their refusal to make large rhetorical gestures is a part of this adversarial spirit. They deliberately avoid using a language which smacks of broadly-based public discourse, because that language has been tainted by those who use it to deceive the public. Listen to the chastening modesties of Owen's The Send Off: Down the close darkening lanes they sang their way To the siding-shed, And lined the train with faces grimly gay. Their breasts were struck all white with wreath and spray As men's are, dead... ... Shall they return to beatings of great bells In wild train-loads? A few, a few, too few for drums and yells, May creep back, silent, to still village wells, Up half-known roads. The great poets of the first world war destroyed hard-core Victorian public poetry, sealing it in its own world, and making it difficult for later offshoots, Kipling's poetry, to lead a secure life. But their strategies were not entirely new. Their satires and polemics owed a great deal to previous satirists and polemicists - to members of the Victorian awkward-squad, to the Augustans before them, and back through history. And as we notice this, we want to say the same thing about successful satires which have been produced in our own time. About Tony Harrison's V, or certain poems by Wendy Cope, or others by Philip Larkin. Satire creates as clear-cut a relationship with its audience as Tennyson does in a poem like the Charge. Owen and Sassoon helped create a kind of public writing we still recognise today, and this involved a vitally adversarial spirit. But this spirit can and must express itself within poems by doing more than openly attacking enemies and disbelievers. The example of John Keats will help show what I mean. We're accustomed to the idea that the young Wordsworth and the young Coleridge were radically dissenting figures, so much so that at one time they were suspected of being spies for the French. We know, too, that Shelley was a firebrand all the days of his short life. We know about William Blake. But generally speaking we've been brought up to think of Keats as an odd man out. While his contemporaries struggled to turn themselves into unacknowledged legislators in the liberal cause, he flopped around on beds of lilies, panting luxuriously, dreaming about sex or death or both together. But the time-honoured views of Keats's genius completely miss the point about how his work engages with the real world of politics and public affairs. It's easy to see why. Think of Shelley's great poem, The Mask of Anarchy, with its unforgettable and unforgotten attack on Castlereagh. We see at once that we are dealing with a public poem of the most passionate and overt kind: I met Murder on the way - He had a mask like Castlereagh - Very smooth he looked, yet grim; Seven blood-hounds followed him: All were fat; and well they might Be in admirable plight, For one by one, and two by two, He tossed them human hearts to chew Which from his wide cloak he drew. One year later, in 1820, Keats wrote To Autumn, a poem which has often been taken as proof of how escapist its author was - how he refused to have anything to do with the various oppressions and cruelties that Shelley savages in the Mask. But if we trace Keats's involvement with liberal politics through his early friendship with radicals like Leigh Hunt, and remember that To Autumn was written in the aftermath of the Peterloo Massacre, shortly after Keats had seen the dissenting orator Henry Hunt making his triumphant entry into London, we might be more willing to look for signs of its public sympathies and involvements. Sympathies which were triggered, not just by outbursts of repressive violence like the massacre itself, but by the long-serving Tory government's campaign to secure a regime of prejudice and disastrous inequality - one which included the repeated suspension of habeus corpus. Here's the last verse: Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they? Think not of them, thou hast thy music too - While barred clouds bloom the soft dying day, And touch the stubble plains with rosy hue: Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn Among the river sallows, borne aloft Or sinking as the light wind lives and dies; And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourne; Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft The red-breast whistles from a garden-croft; And gathering swallows twitter in the skies. In the previous two stanzas of the poem, we've been shown a landscape which is so tense and bulging with fruitfulness, it's only a fraction short of becoming rotten. And also one in which certain living things have to keep up a ferocious workrate (I'm thinking of the bees and those \"more /And still more, later flowers\"). In the same way, what we have in these 10 lines is a picture of abundance which is profoundly troubled and troubling: the day is \"soft-dying\", admittedly, but it is dying; the gnats are \"mournful\"; the lambs and the robin are only days away from winter, and the swallows - well, the swallows are about to leave the country, just as Keats's brother George had recently emigrated to America to escape what Keats referred to in one of his letters as the \"burden\" of contemporary politics. What we have in To Autumn is a poem which is self-evidently unlike the kind we find Shelley writing in The Mask of Anarchy. It is a poem which registers the pressure and shock of its contemporary moment, and is full of anxiety and foreboding - but which transmutes those feelings into organic and pastoral terms. It is, in its refractions and assimilations, profoundly conscious of public life, and we do it a great disservice if we are not alive to this ingredient and intention. I want to give one more example of this kind of double-level writing. Edward Thomas, who incidentally wrote a very good book about Keats, was killed at the Battle of Arras in April 1917, but virtually all his poems were written during the time he spent in England between enlisting and crossing the Channel. When we read him, we should not expect to find descriptions of trenches and mud and slaughter . But does this make him any less of a war poet than Owen or Sassoon? Not in my book it doesn't. It means that we are conscious of the war in his work in much the same way that we are conscious of contemporary politics in Keats. As an example, here is the beginning of the poem The Sun Used to Shine, written in May 1916, in which Thomas remembers a walk that he took with his friend, the American poet Robert Frost, through the fields near Ledbury in Gloucestershire: The sun used to shine while we two walked Slowly together, paused and started Again, and sometimes mused, sometimes talked As either pleased, and, cheerfully parted Each night. We never disagreed Which gate to rest on. The to be And the late past we gave small heed. We turned from men or poetry To rumours of the war remote Only till both stood disinclined For aught but the yellow flavorous coat Of an apple wasps had undermined; Or a sentry of dark betonies, The stateliest of small flowers on earth, At the forest verge; or crocuses Pale purple as if they had their birth In sunless Hades fields. The war, though \"remote\", shows up more clearly here than the Peterloo Massacre does in Keats's \"To Autumn\". But the same imaginative principle applies in both poems. Like Keats, Thomas feels the weight of a particular public moment, and rather than addressing it directly, he responds in a way which is resolutely personal, transformative and sensuous. He rises to the challenge of the instant, but seeks out general truths and durable verities. For these reasons, we would do well to think of Keats and Thomas, and of other poets who work in the same way, as \"active\" poets rather than \"reactive\" ones. Instead of Tennyson's direct assault on a subject, we have a layered approach; instead of heroic types, we have wary individuals; instead of a ringingly centered language, we have highly personalised voices. What is public in Thomas has nothing to do with plinths and trumpets. I wrote my graduate thesis on Edward Thomas 25 years ago, and ever since then he has remained an exemplary figure for me. As, of course, has Keats. But while it would be true to say that they are in my mind most days, they have lived in me even more vividly and vigorously since I was appointed Poet Laureate, and have deeply influenced the ways that I have thought about writing public poems. Tennyson is the Laureate I most admire and his Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington opens: Bury the Great Duke With an empire's lamentation, Let us bury the Great Duke To the noise of the mourning of a mighty nation, Mourning when their leaders fall, Warriors carry the warrior's pall, And sorrow darkens hamlet and hall. Tennyson had a sure sense of what was established and inviolable in his world. Grieving for what he calls elsewhere in the poem the \"foremost captain of his time\" he hears the sound of not just a \"nation weeping\", but of a whole empire, and does his best to articulate mass-sorrow in an appropriately booming language. The authority of the poem depends on his having no doubts about the rightness of this. It leaves no cracks in its structure through which questions about Wellington's politics might appear, or scepticism about the state's motives when it sent him on his various campaigns, or anxiety about the existence and operation of empire itself. Wellington is a straight up and down hero - the latest in a distinguished line. God, we deduce, really must be an Englishman if he can see Wellington's worth so accurately: He is gone who seem'd so great - Gone; but nothing can bereave him Of the force he made his own Being here, and we believe him Something far advanced in State, And that he wears a truer crown Than any wreath that man can weave him. Speak no more of his renown, Lay your earthly fancies down, And in the vast cathedral leave him. God accept him, Christ receive him It's easy to mock this kind of thing. Its rhetoric drowns out the questions we would like to raise. This is why I refer to it as a hardcore public poem. Even if Tennyson knew that he lived in a society made up of different societies. he didn't have any hesitation in speaking \"for the nation\" when the occasion demanded it. But what is a poet to do today when invited to respond to a \"national occasion\"? It is a commonplace, but one worth repeating, to say that much of the delight we take in our contemporary society has to do with its diversity. This is absolutely not to say \"there is no such thing as society\", but to insist on its many facets, faiths, components and interests. There was a good deal of discussion about this last May, around the time of my appointment as Laureate. How can any one poet, a person who inevitably has a certain background, attitude, and take on the world, be expected to speak for everybody in their country? How can they avoid missing out on large sections of the community? Can they escape becoming a stooge of royalty or the government? How can they seem properly inclusive without becoming bland? At the outset, I told myself that I had been appointed because I had written what I had written - and that I should resist any pressures to turn myself into a different kind of writer. That's to say I knew that I was a personal kind of poet, and felt that I should therefore respond to occasions in a personal way: as a private citizen, putting my work into a public space without any illusions that I would necessarily echo universally-held thoughts and opinions. This decision has had at least three consequences. One, obviously, is to do with tone - my determination to continue using the same sort of speaking voice that I have always used. One is to do with the subjects themselves - my decision to honour the tradition of writing poems about events in the royal calendar but to make such poems part of a larger pattern of writing about other kinds of public event. And one is to do with approach - with that willingness I admire in Keats and Thomas - to look around or beyond a specific event. I'm not trying to suggest that I want to shy away from the reality of these events, rather that I want to engage with them, while at the same time remaining alert to their general, symbolic or even allegorical values. The poem I wrote for the wedding of Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys Jones is one which wants to remind its readers of the questions which preoccupy all people in love and getting married: will the things we say today last into the future, how will we cope with our changing selves? In the same spirit, the poem I wrote for the TUC, in spite of their good-natured suggestion that I should concentrate on international trade relations, was about individual liberty. The poem I wrote about the Paddington rail disaster focuses on that tragedy, but refers to other kinds of bereavements and brutal severings. So too, in the poem I wrote about the millennium, I was concerned with the unceasing flow of time rather than the jerk of a minute-hand at one specific moment.

In every case I had a phrase from Keats's letters resonating in my head: \"We hate poetry that has a palpable design on us.\" Andrew Marvell's Horatian Ode upon Cromwell's Return from Ireland goes about its public business in ways that seem to me exemplary. Although not in any sense a publicly-funded poem, its rare qualities nevertheless vitalise those issues of freedom and choice which have been my constant refrain. Marvell has been given a certain amount of stick for seeming in two minds about almost everything. TS Eliot, famously, called him a \"lukewarm partisan\" and it's certainly true that there is something elusive about Marvell's character, and something in his work that we slide off, however much we admire it. Think of all those little sealed entities he gives us in his lyric poems - the drops of dew and the thrush's eyes. Their high polish makes it difficult for us to get a purchase, in the same way that their circularity seems to exclude us. In the Horatian Ode, we are not so much held at arm's length as impelled to share a balanced opinion. The poem was probably written in 1650, shortly after Cromwell had returned from his campaign in Ireland and before he began his campaign in Scotland - a campaign which his Lieutenant-General, Fairfax, refused to lead. Because Marvell later worked as the tutor to Fairfax's daughter at Nun Appleton House in Yorkshire, it's often supposed that the poem's point of view is not really Marvell's at all, but his future employer's. In fact there is no evidence to suggest that Marvell even knew Fairfax when he wrote the poem. Its balance is entirely his own, and entirely characteristic. As a matter of hard fact, Marvell in 1650 regarded Cromwell as someone whose private life was beyond reproach but whose policies were Machiavellian. In the poem, he offers us Cromwell as a man without personal ambition who is bent on upholding an ideal of impartial justice. Though justice against fate complain, And plead the ancient rights in vain: But those do hold or break As men are strong or weak. There is, of course, a way of reading this which would make Marvell seem credulous. But in truth the power of the poem lies in its detachment - detachment which is most clearly on show in the celebrated lines describing the execution of Charles I: He nothing common did or mean Upon that memorable scene: But with his keener eye The axe's edge did try: Nor called the Gods with vulgar spite To vindicate his helpless Right, But bowed his comely head Down as upon a bed. As Cromwell's unofficial Laureate, Marvell deals brilliantly with the question of how to address public issues in a way which is at once engaged and independent. Living through a time of revolutionary change, he does not respond as a propagandist for one side or another, but as someone bearing witness to interior realities. This is the quality that needs to be defended in public writing: the ability to stand outside an event, even to transform it, while registering its pressures and importance.

When something is referred to as an institution, the general peception is that it is a bad thing, or at least that it is dyed-in-the-wool. This is not the case with TMS.

TMS has often been criticised for being full of overgrown schoolboys, not giving the score enough, and rambling on about events that happened 30 or 40 years ago. What the critics don't realise is that this is precisely what makes TMS work: the practical jokes, providing entertainment during boring passages in play, anecdotes during rain interruptions, and, most importantly, painting a picture of the action and surroundings for those who can be there only in spirit.</p> <p>I am not denying there are areas for improvement, but it is not the fault of the programme that they have to go to the shipping forecast or start late on a Sunday because of The Archers.

      "bodyText": "To say that the ECB should be congratulated for awarding the BBC a new five-year contract for radio broadcasting rights to England's home series is an understatement. For all its faults, the ECB has for once seen sense: they have put broadcast quality before financial quantity. Test Match Special has been around for more than 40 years and has become as much a radio institution as The Archers. When something is referred to as an institution, the general peception is that it is a bad thing, or at least that it is dyed-in-the-wool. This is not the case with TMS. After all, they were the first and so far only British cricket broadcast to introduce a female commentator, Donna Symmonds, into their ranks, on the England tour to the West Indies in 1997-98. The commentators (even the annoying ones) possess the skill of making the listener feel as if they are in the company of friends. TMS has often been criticised for being full of overgrown schoolboys, not giving the score enough, and rambling on about events that happened 30 or 40 years ago. What the critics don't realise is that this is precisely what makes TMS work: the practical jokes, providing entertainment during boring passages in play, anecdotes during rain interruptions, and, most importantly, painting a picture of the action and surroundings for those who can be there only in spirit. I am not denying there are areas for improvement, but it is not the fault of the programme that they have to go to the shipping forecast or start late on a Sunday because of The Archers. It's not as if going off for adverts every five minutes or having commentators act as advertisers can enhance the listeners' enjoyment very much. I chose not to listen to Talksport during the winter and it seems I didn't miss out on much. What Kelvin McKenzie has to remember is that commentating for radio requires skill. So if you recruit a team that is generally used to TV commentary it cannot possibly be expected to provide as professional a performance and create as comfortable an atmosphere on radio as TMS do. For Chris Wilson and all others who were full of praise for Chris Cowdrey, it is worth noting that he had several years' experience as a summariser with TMS long before Talksport existed. He was not therefore \"a find\". TMS will continue to inform and entertain listeners, at least during English summers, for many years to come. As Mr McKenzie has just discovered, quality has won over quantity. Kathryn Williams comes from the Isle of Man and is a second-year student at Edge Hill College in Lancashire, reading for a Communication and Media degree. She has been a fan of TMS since 1994.

      "body": "<p>This week Pope John Paul II, preparing to apologise publicly for past wrongs committed by the church, has found himself embroiled in a controversy over the kidnapping of a child which took place more than 140 years ago. The pope's conciliatory gesture has been undermined by his recent decision to beatify a precedessor, Pius IX, who in 1858 snatched a six-year-old Jewish boy, Edgardo Mortara, after a maid claimed she had illicitly baptised the child. </p> <p>Elena Mortara, his great-great-niece, who teaches English literature at Rome University has spoken out against the Vatican's decision to beatify Pius IX and has gained support from Italy's Jews and liberal Catholics. \"My great-grandmother saw her brother being taken away. As a mother she had constant nightmares that her own children would be kidnapped\". </p> <p>Edgardo was taken from his family in Bologna under the pope's orders, forcibly converted to Catholicism and became a priest. The Pope regarded him as his son but treated him harshly. The child's family tried all legal means to get him back but Pius blocked every move. </p> <p>The practice in the Papal domains of kidnapping Jewish children to bring them up as Catholics was an old one. When Edgardo Mortara was taken from his family by papal gendarmes in Bologna - then under papal rule - the order came from the inquisitor who declared he was acting on the pope's orders. Edgardo was taken to Rome where he ended up in the Lateran Fathers of St Peter in Chains. </p> <p>The boy was given a strict religious education and was ordained a priest in 1873, taking the name of Pius. His mother saw him in Rome when, as she told the Italian magistrates, \"he threw himself round my neck and both of us were so distraught that we clung on to each other convulsively\". Later, she was not even allowed to see him. </p> <p>In 1870, Edgardo's father made one last attempt by having his son, then 19, called up by the army. But again, he was spirited away, this time, to the south Tyrol, then under Austrian rule. There were appeals from France, Britain, the US, the Netherlands and even Catholic Spain. From Britain, the 75-year-old Jewish philanthropist, Sir Moses Montefiore made a journey to Rome with the support of the UK Jewish communities, many Anglicans and the foreign office. But Pius was adamant that the boy should not be returned. He \"adopted\" Edgardo in a physical as well as spiritual way. </p> <p>As Edgardo's father tried desperately to get his son back, Pius was dismissive: \"He has another six and I have only the one\". The pope would remind Edgardo of the huge international outcry calling for his return: \"How I have suffered for you\". </p> <p>Mortara described one episode many years later: \"On March 11 1868, I found myself with my brothers in religion in the basilica of St Gregory when the bells announced the arrival of His Holiness. I bowed down on the threshold of the Basilica and as the Holy Father passed, I wanted to kiss his foot and with youthful enthusiasm, I hit his knee with such force that the Holy Father almost lost his balance.\" </p> <p>Pius was angry: \"It would be fine if people said Mortara tried to kill the pope after he loved him so much. You must do penance. Kiss the ground.\" Edgardo immediately did so. \"That is not enough\" added His Holiness, \"make three crosses with your tongue.\" Pius then remarked to the people around, \"Look how obedient he is... and next time be more careful\". </p> <p>Pius worked hard to be a father to Edgardo: \"When he was out walking and he met me, he would call me and like any good father, he would play, hiding me under his great red cloak and would joke asking 'Where is the boy?'and then open the cloak and say 'Here he is!' \" </p> <p>In 1907 Edgardo wrote \"Providence did me the favour not only of seeing and knowing Pius IX but of being adopted and honoured with paternal affection by him without any merit on my part. For him I was the child of tears and he loved me like a mother who prefers the son who has made her suffer the most\". </p> <p>Mortara suffered terrible depressions, which he hints at in his diary: \"First Friday. Monthly retreat. Prayed a lot and made every effort to ovecome myself and banish those thoughts of sadness. Impossible since all circumstances had their influence and on top of it all, I had a sore throat. I could not take it any more. Finally, a ray of light.\" </p> <p>Despite ill health, Mortara lived to be 88 and died in Belgium two months before the Nazi invasion. Six weeks ago, Elena Mortara went to a meeting in Rome for the promotion of Jewish-Christian understanding and asked Cardinal Ersilio Tonino for the church's position on the Mortara case. He answered \"I don't know anything about the case\", adding \"I am sure His Holiness does not either.\" </p> <p>When she wrote a letter to the news weekly Espresso, she had some supportive replies but also some telling her that Pius IX had given Edgardo eternal salvation. And 1983 canon law, introduced when John Paul II was already pope, still allows for the baptism of a child on the point of death \"even against the will of the parents\".

Perhaps among the lesser of our sins was to resurrect for the brief span of Tuesday's early editions, Pope John XXIII, who, we may have alarmed some readers by saying, was \"very active\" (perhaps for the first time since his death in 1963). Pope John Paul II succeeded him in later editions but not before readers of the flawed editions had remarked upon the \"miracle\". </p> <p>During the past week more than 200 of you, almost double the number complaining weekly a few months ago, have been in touch, producing a crop of corrections, some of which might make a cynic blush. One of the most serious causes of complaint was the inappropriate use of a picture of a man holding a young girl hostage with a knife at her throat - to illustrate an article about savings accounts. One of the readers who complained about this threatened to cancel her paper if we did not apologise immediately. Her letter actually arrived after the apology had appeared. I wrote, rather tetchily perhaps, suggesting that she was unlikely to find another paper prepared to confess and apologise in the way that the Guardian did, although all newspapers made mistakes and errors of judgment. It does, perhaps, now I hear it again, sound a bit holier-than-thou. </p> <p>One recent complaint came from a former prisoner who had met Ian Brady in Wormwood Scrubs prison in 1978, and who said we were quite wrong to maintain, as we did in a leader, that Brady had endured \"two decades of solitary confinement\". The leader writer accepted this and we carried a correction in yesterday's paper. </p> <p>The ex-prisoner, a reader of the Guardian over many years, went farther and said that since Brady had not been in solitary confinement, it was therefore wrong to imply, as we appeared to be doing, that this was the cause of a deterioration in his mental state. \"I was with him in G2 wing in April 1978, for about two weeks ... After my appeal I was returned to the Scrubs hospital wing and met Brady again. 'Ah, there's a face I remember,' he said to me, and I was in a ward with around 20 others at the time. He came in for association, as he was still in G2 downstairs. Brady had association time at the Scrubs [and] was not in solitary ...\" </p> <p>Shortly after the corrections column had been completed and proofread on Monday evening I was telephoned by the writer of a piece in our magazine to say that he had mistakenly quoted Bono of U2 as saying, \"I became a fan of club music, of drug culture ...\" What Bono had actually said was rather different, \"club music, club culture ...\" That passage on the tape recording of the interview, the writer explained, had been partially obscured by background noise. The corrections were retrieved and that one, with an apology to Bono, went in the following morning. </p> <p>We do try to respond quickly when it is clearly necessary to do so and where the error is a significant one. Rather reluctantly I have added this word \"significant\" to the paragraph that appears at the end of the corrections column every day. Since the beginning of the year we have been saying, \"It is the policy of the Guardian to correct significant errors as soon as possible.\" Although you may not see much evidence of it, this is what all newspapers undertake to do under the terms of the code of conduct monitored by the Press Complaints Commission. Paragraph 1 (ii) of the code says, \"Whenever it is recognised that a significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distorted report has been published, it must be corrected promptly and with due prominence.\" We continue, in fact, to go a good way farther than that and carry many corrections that could not be said to be of great significance - they usually have some instructional value for us (and often give rise to a laugh at our expense). They are all nevertheless putting right mistakes that we have made, and they have, in the vast majority of cases, been pointed out by readers for whom we provide daily sport.

Well, that last is not altogether true, which you'll find out soon enough when you follow these instructions. The number of kidneys required depends purely on the level of your passion for eating them. All you need to serve with them is a stack of buttered French beans, some decent creamy mash and a little English mustard. Serves two. 6 fresh lamb's kidneys, in their fat Salt and pepper Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/ gas mark 6. Place the kidneys in their fat on a roasting tray and put them into the oven. Cook for 10-15 minutes, then remove the tray from the oven, peel off the fat with a sharp knife, and season liberally. That's it.",

As a result it faces the loss of 1,700 jobs and maybe closure. </p> <p>Meanwhile, in London, <a href=\"http://www.lastminute.com\">Lastminute.com</a>, an internet start-up company that had income of only \u00a3409,000 in the most recent quarter, is about to be launched on the stock market at a valuation that could approach a dizzy \u00a31bn. Lastminute.com is the most innovative of the hundreds of British net start-ups and deserves to succeed. Its business model of selling hotel rooms, flights and other services with a limited shelf life is one of the very few not to have been copied from the United States. In its brief 19-month life it has built up a very strong \"brand\" in the market place. It has achieved an iconic status among other start-ups and its success on the stock market will be watched very closely by analysts waiting for the dot.com bubble to burst. </p> <p>And burst it will. The valuations accorded to US and UK net companies have long since lost anchor with reality. Their valuations only make sense if they have uncovered a new market in which they will make very large profit margins indeed. They have not and it won't happen. Why?

The arrival of internet commerce has generated a deflationary environment in which it is difficult to make serious profits in the market place (as opposed to the market in stocks).

In Belfast, Harland and Wolff - wilting under the weight of its industrial history - has just lost a \u00a3400m bid to build the Queen Mary II superliner. As a result it faces the loss of 1,700 jobs and maybe closure. Meanwhile, in London, Lastminute.com, an internet start-up company that had income of only \u00a3409,000 in the most recent quarter, is about to be launched on the stock market at a valuation that could approach a dizzy \u00a31bn. Lastminute.com is the most innovative of the hundreds of British net start-ups and deserves to succeed. Its business model of selling hotel rooms, flights and other services with a limited shelf life is one of the very few not to have been copied from the United States. In its brief 19-month life it has built up a very strong \"brand\" in the market place. It has achieved an iconic status among other start-ups and its success on the stock market will be watched very closely by analysts waiting for the dot.com bubble to burst. And burst it will. The valuations accorded to US and UK net companies have long since lost anchor with reality. Their valuations only make sense if they have uncovered a new market in which they will make very large profit margins indeed. They have not and it won't happen. Why? Because of the characteristics of the very internet they espouse. In terms of business-to-consumer commerce, the net is a consumers' not a producers' paradise.

The betting account is run in tandem with the Isa, rather than within it. When the fund is frozen and the market falls the winnings from the bet are paid in as a new investment. If the market rises, the sale of units to pay the debt to IG Index will give rise to a CGT liability.",

Iqbal Raad was hit several times in the chest and died in his chair at his second-floor office in the Paradise Chambers building in central Karachi. Two other men in the room, an office worker and a judge's son, were also killed in the attack. The shooting comes two days after Mr Sharif gave evidence at his trial and accused Pakistan's military ruler, General Pervez Musharraf, of plotting to overthrow his government and inventing charges against him. Witnesses said the gunmen, who were carrying a Kalashnikov rifle and pistols, ran from the building into a waiting car and disappeared in the crowded traffic. Crowds gathered outside the lawyer's offices together with Mr Raad's wife and two sons as the bloodstained bodies were carried out. \"This could be an act of sabotage to damage the smooth functioning of the trial.

Mr Maskhadov made the claim as, after days of denials, military chiefs in Moscow admitted that 85 crack Russian paratroopers were killed by Chechen rebel forces in fierce mountain fighting last week. In a telephone interview with the Guardian and two other western newspapers from an undisclosed location in southern Chechnya, President Maskhadov said battles were raging for control of up to eight villages in the Argun gorge, in the highlands of southern Chechnya, where several thousand guerrillas are hemmed in by a Russian air and artillery onslaught. Russia's acting president, Vladimir Putin, said he would probably impose direct Russian presidential rule on Chechnya after the presidential election on March 26, which he is expected to win. But while Mr Putin declared it his \"historic mission\" to tame Chechnya, Mr Maskhadov said: \"All talk from Russian generals that they have won the war is complete rubbish.\" The Chechen leader spoke of fierce fighting near the villages of Komsomolskoye, Ulus-Kert and Selmentausen, where his fighters inflicted a devastating blow on elite Russian units at the beginning of the month.

      "bodyText": "China sent a tough message to the United States yesterday not to \"interfere\" with Taiwan, saying relations with Washington had reached a critical point. The foreign minister, Tang Jiaxuan, accused the US of responsibility for \"the tension in the Taiwan straits\" in the run-up to presidential elections on the island in a week's time. \"What the US has done has inflated the arrogance of the separatist [pro-independence] forces in Taiwan,\" Mr Tang told a press conference in Beijing. China's ambassador to the US has formally protested in Washington about a Pentagon decision to sell Taiwan upgraded missiles and radar equipment. Most observers blame Beijing for raising the tension last month by threatening in a new white paper to use force if Taiwan continued to delay negotiations on reunification indefinitely. Mr Tang said China was still waiting for the US to inform it of \"the true outcome of the investigation\" into last year's bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, and to \"bring the perpetrators to justice\". Speaking to the international press at a conference called by the national people's congress - China's annual parliament - Mr Tang may have added a diplomatic gloss to Beijing's recent harsh statements. But no one expects the foreign ministry to incur the suspicion of the Chinese armed forces and elements in the Communist party who may regard it as already too soft towards the outside world. A Chinese TV programme has been portraying the might of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) every night this week to bolster the message, delivered to the congress by army delegates, that it is ready to take action on Taiwan. On Thursday President Jiang Zemin donned a dark-green Maoist suit to meet the delegates, calling on them to \"increase actual combat capability\". Western diplomats in Beijing say senior PLA leaders have recently made a point of stressing to high-level foreign visitors that there is now a \"timetable\" for regainingTaiwan. The generals do not mention a date but suggest that China cannot tolerate many more years of division while pro-independence opinion in Taiwan continues to grow. \"Retired army generals - who may still have influence - also believe strongly that the Taiwan issue must be settled before they themselves are dead and buried,\" says one diplomat. The consensus among experts is still that China is highly unlikely to take action. Full-scale invasion is militarily unfeasible, given Taiwan's distance from the mainland and logistical difficulties - plus the risk of US counter-intervention. Limited moves, such as occupying an offshore island or incursions into Taiwan's air or sea space, are tactically possible. But they would hardly assist in the strategic aim of persuading the reluctant Taiwanese of the need for reunification. Yet analysts admit they are largely in the dark and are waiting anxiously to see whether whoever wins in Taiwan on March 18 can defuse the situation. Mr Jiang has said whoever wins will be welcome to visit Beijing \"as long as he supports the idea of one China\". Responding to Mr Tang, the US defence secretary, William Cohen, said yesterday in Hong Kong: \"China is required in our opinion to seek a peaceful resolution on the situation in Taiwan, and not to try in any way to intimidate them.\" Mr Cohen said the newly announced supplies to Taiwan are designed to keep its \"20-year-old technology\" working and do not increase the island's offensive capability. Taiwan has also requested more advanced weaponry, including four guided-missile destroyers equipped with the sophisticated Aegis system. Mr Cohen said the request was under review, hinting that further Chinese threats to Taiwan might tip the balance in favour of granting it. However, Chinese anger with the US over Taiwan has historical roots. \"It is an issue left over from the Chinese civil war which would have been resolved but for the intervention of the US seventh fleet,\" Mr Tang said yesterday. He professed to be unaware of Bill Clinton's speech on Wednesday, in which the US president offered a more positive view of the Chinese white paper.",

And if they eventually settle here, hopefully they will become Millwall supporters.\" Given the adverse publicity surrounding the presence of refugees in Britain at least those visiting the New Den next week will be able to empathise with the Millwall fans' anthem, which contains the line: \"No one likes us, we don't care.\"",

It moved from adversity to triumph in the big leaps that have been denied to Dan. King Gimp was made up of scenes of Dan growing from age 13 when he was attending a special school and living with his mother to his graduation ceremony 13 years later, when this award- winning painter got his art degree. </p> <p>It could have been sentimental but for its angry, insightful subject. He didn't want a Hawking-style computer voicebox, for instance, even though it would make his speech more readily comprehensible, because people would talk to the computer rather than him. </p> <p>We saw him changing out of a sweatshirt into a T-shirt. It was a farcical wrangle between man and shirt which, most of the time, the T-shirt looked like winning. After he triumphed, Dan rolled up to the camera and said in his barely comprehensible voice: \"Another day of crap.\" Thanks to this scene and Dan's angry attitude to the difficulties he had to put up with, we got an insight into the downside - his loneliness, his desperate need to express himself in paintings, his hunger for a sex life. </p> <p>Television can be, but often isn't, good at this sort of programme.

      "body": "<p>Demob-happy Zo\u00eb Ball, in her final week on the Radio 1 breakfast show, has been campaigning to prevent the Di Marcos leaving EastEnders. So have other Radio 1 DJs. What is it with Radio 1 and EastEnders? There's clearly a symbiotic relationship between the breakfast show, the tabloids and the soaps, with the first two parasitic on the third as well as on each other. It can't be long before they all meld into one intertextual heap. </p> <p>Ball's laddishness has been trumpeted, but it's her androgyny that attracts teen and pre-teen listeners. There's a young-girliness about the way she moans and says she can't do things, and relates to Zo\u00eb A, a member of the baying, giggling background mob otherwise known as the zoo . </p> <p>She kissed the show goodbye yesterday, so it seems the zoo format will disappear along with her. About time. In the future, the stale sound of the baying, giggling zoo team will be recalled with much the same air of astonishment as we now look back on Louis XIV's courtiers admiring le roi's public toilet-using. The Ball show has gone. Long Live the apparently zooless Sara Cox. </p> <p>On Radio 4 Alan Bennett was back. His five-part story, Father! Father! Burning Bright, described the death of a father as experienced by his bitter son. Midgley is a middle-aged teacher, equally despised by his dad and wife, grudgingly granted leave by his headteacher to go and sit in vigil by the hospital bedside of his comatose father. </p> <p>The terrain is clearly Bennett land, a place where people interject domestic non-sequiturs into key emotional moments. Where melancholy and regret escape apologetically, almost like wind. </p> <p>At its start, Father! Father! seemed almost a Bennett self- parody. But he is the poet of diffidence, the bard of ambivalence. And here he mapped out how the consummately polite deal with grief and rage. He's an astute geographer of social exchanges and although the story wasn't exactly dramatic, it was certainly masterly, and the ending brilliant. In an endeavour to free himself from his constricted lifestyle, Midgeley is bedding a sympathetic nurse just as his father wakes up - sans son - before dying. Dad had triumphed again. </p> <p>It takes a skilful soul to blend actuality and actors, and keep empathy from curdling into voyeurism, but BBC Scotland's Dave Batchelor, who last year gave us the brilliant Radio 3 production of Kark Kraus's The Last Days of Mankind, did just that in Postcards from Shannon (Radio 4), a drama-documentary about the Lockerbie crash. Shannon Davis was a 19-year-old Syracuse university student travelling round Europe, from where she sent postcards to her mother, Jane. Volunteer Phil Haigh was combing the area where the Pan Am crashed when he came upon Shannon's open suitcase with a letter from her mother ending: \"We're all excited about you coming home for Christmas\". </p> <p>Writer George Rosie combined Shannon's postcards (convincingly read by Theresa Reid) and Phil's reminiscences (an equally sharp Mark McDonnell) with the real Jane's account and news bulletins to create a devastating piece of radio, impossible to hear without asking how people survive such sudden losses. </p> <p>Shannon's postcards gave a strong sense of the perky American (\"Florence is a neat city\"), while Phil's battered incomprehension at the disaster conveyed how his life had been irrevocably altered too. There were moments of unbearable juxtaposition, as when Shannon's account of visiting Dachau segued into Phil's description of a fieldful of shoes. And when Jane and Phil met at a Lockerbie reception, the shared pain must have extended to every listener.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Demob-happy Zo\u00eb Ball, in her final week on the Radio 1 breakfast show, has been campaigning to prevent the Di Marcos leaving EastEnders. So have other Radio 1 DJs. What is it with Radio 1 and EastEnders? There's clearly a symbiotic relationship between the breakfast show, the tabloids and the soaps, with the first two parasitic on the third as well as on each other. It can't be long before they all meld into one intertextual heap. Ball's laddishness has been trumpeted, but it's her androgyny that attracts teen and pre-teen listeners. There's a young-girliness about the way she moans and says she can't do things, and relates to Zo\u00eb A, a member of the baying, giggling background mob otherwise known as the zoo . She kissed the show goodbye yesterday, so it seems the zoo format will disappear along with her. About time. In the future, the stale sound of the baying, giggling zoo team will be recalled with much the same air of astonishment as we now look back on Louis XIV's courtiers admiring le roi's public toilet-using. The Ball show has gone. Long Live the apparently zooless Sara Cox. On Radio 4 Alan Bennett was back. His five-part story, Father! Father! Burning Bright, described the death of a father as experienced by his bitter son. Midgley is a middle-aged teacher, equally despised by his dad and wife, grudgingly granted leave by his headteacher to go and sit in vigil by the hospital bedside of his comatose father. The terrain is clearly Bennett land, a place where people interject domestic non-sequiturs into key emotional moments. Where melancholy and regret escape apologetically, almost like wind. At its start, Father! Father! seemed almost a Bennett self- parody. But he is the poet of diffidence, the bard of ambivalence. And here he mapped out how the consummately polite deal with grief and rage. He's an astute geographer of social exchanges and although the story wasn't exactly dramatic, it was certainly masterly, and the ending brilliant. In an endeavour to free himself from his constricted lifestyle, Midgeley is bedding a sympathetic nurse just as his father wakes up - sans son - before dying. Dad had triumphed again. It takes a skilful soul to blend actuality and actors, and keep empathy from curdling into voyeurism, but BBC Scotland's Dave Batchelor, who last year gave us the brilliant Radio 3 production of Kark Kraus's The Last Days of Mankind, did just that in Postcards from Shannon (Radio 4), a drama-documentary about the Lockerbie crash. Shannon Davis was a 19-year-old Syracuse university student travelling round Europe, from where she sent postcards to her mother, Jane. Volunteer Phil Haigh was combing the area where the Pan Am crashed when he came upon Shannon's open suitcase with a letter from her mother ending: \"We're all excited about you coming home for Christmas\". Writer George Rosie combined Shannon's postcards (convincingly read by Theresa Reid) and Phil's reminiscences (an equally sharp Mark McDonnell) with the real Jane's account and news bulletins to create a devastating piece of radio, impossible to hear without asking how people survive such sudden losses. Shannon's postcards gave a strong sense of the perky American (\"Florence is a neat city\"), while Phil's battered incomprehension at the disaster conveyed how his life had been irrevocably altered too. There were moments of unbearable juxtaposition, as when Shannon's account of visiting Dachau segued into Phil's description of a fieldful of shoes. And when Jane and Phil met at a Lockerbie reception, the shared pain must have extended to every listener.",

So we get all this nonsense about bullet trains, most of which is printed uncritically by a press which remains far more in awe of Branson's achievements than the public.

Margaret Thatcher was talking to Brunson's successor, John Sergeant (remember the famous time in 1990 when she handbagged him outside the Paris embassy?) and to Alan Duncan, the tiny ex-confidante of William Hague. \"Where is Denis?\" she suddenly remarked, \"we have to go for dinner with Cap Weinberger.\" </p> <p>\"He's over there, talking to Michael Heseltine,\" Duncan told her, rather bravely I thought. She glowered, majestically. \"Dinner is far more important,\" she said. \"Go and tell him that if he doesn't come here within two minutes, I shall go over and scowl at them both.\" Naturally Denis was at her side within seconds. My informant assures me that she was, to some extent, consciously caricaturing herself. </p> <p>\u0095 Jeffrey Archer begins his diary in this week's Spectator: \"Last Friday evening I had dinner with Vanessa Redgrave at the Ivy.\" I wonder if Ms Redgrave is aware that this meal took place? </p> <p>\u0095 If I were Frank Dobson (whom I like and respect a lot, though I'll be voting for Ken, like almost all Londoners) I'd spend more time pointing out that nearly all the people who know Ken and who have worked with him plan to vote against him.

Was it his rampant egomania? </p> <p>\"No,\" he said, \"rampant egomania we can live with. We encourage rampant egomania. It's just that he's so damn' popular.\" </p> <p>\u0095 I enjoyed hearing Kelvin MacKenzie whingeing on Thursday about the way the BBC had won the radio rights for home test cricket matches. Since his station, known as Talksport, had offered \u00a32.5m more than the BBC over five years, he felt this proved that \"though our money was good enough, possibly our accents were not good enough\". </p> <p>I doubt that.

Now, with my parents both dead, I find myself dreaming about Butlin's at least twice a week. I think it might be my Land Of Lost Content, but I wouldn't swear to it. </p> <p>I'm a happy sort of bunny, and I always believe that where I am is the best place to be. But if I had to say when I was the happiest I've ever been, I'd say it was during the four summer holidays my parents and I spent at Butlin's, Bognor Regis, in the late 60s/early 70s. For an imaginative, solitary, hedonistic, working-class girl child at that time, it was very heaven - truly, my very own empire of the senses.</p> <p> I'll tell you what: that old king wouldn't have said \"Bugger Bognor\" from his deathbed if they'd had a Butlin's there then. He'd have risen from it, rolled up his trousers and entered the knobbly knees contest. Arriving at the front office, you checked in the Old You at the desk and went to find your chalet, where the limber, lithe and most definitely not shy New You, already having slipped into its sarong and sandals, would rise smiling from the single bed, sand falling from its silky thighs, to take your hand and lead you out into the shimmering surrealism that was Butlin's at its best. </p> <p>Bob Lind's Elusive Butterfly was often played during one of these holidays, and it is to the melancholy strains of this song that, in my dreams, I pad restlessly, vainly seeking my parents, through the deserted camp: through the echo-ey swimming pools with the parrots hanging from glass ceilings, past the abandoned crazy golf courses and through the Beachcomber Lounge, where the swimmers' legs move in eerie autonomy through the glass panels on the wall. But everything's in the wrong place now, and I can never find my way home again. </p> <p>I went back there a few weeks ago. None of the fairground rides was open. Admittedly, it was February, but it also happened to be a scorching sunny, February day, as the majority of days in February were this year down here on the coast. And it was half term! Would it have killed them to open up a few dodgems and turn the waltzer on? The once-beautiful indoor swimming pool now had no room for swimming at all, only for queuing wearily in order finally to use the water slides: 15 minutes of boredom in return for 15 seconds of fun. </p> <p>Most of Butlin's is now a covered mini-mall of fast-food outlets and tacky gift shops. It's very hard to imagine exactly who would derive pleasure from such a visit, unless they had been held prisoner in a concrete bunker for the past 50 years. In the fast-food outlets, people queued for 20 minutes for a plate of chips. What's it going to be like in summer? And why is such food called \"fast\" at all? </p> <p>All in all, the decimation of my own little Shangri-La made me think of a phrase from a Joseph Heller novel, Good As Gold - \"crusading inertia\". Crusading inertia is best demonstrated, of course, by the \"revolutionary\" replacement of human telephone operators by recorded ones telling you to push buttons after the tone: far from speeding things up and helping companies to work at maximum efficiency, automation has actually slowed down this part of life, not to mention been responsible for dangerously raising the blood pressure of millions. Look at traffic: there's now so much of it that it actually takes longer to get across London than it did 20 years ago. Before long, things will be so bad that it would have taken a shorter time in the heyday of the hansom cab. </p> <p>Crusading inertia - by which I mean a frenzied determination to replace existing mechanisms with new ones, which invariably prove less satisfactory, but then cannot be changed back due to a combination of stinginess and pride - is everywhere. It's those Virgin trains with 10 types of ticket and an absolute inability to get anywhere on time. It's when businesses screw up, blithely explaining that \"the computers have crashed\", as though the computers were Kings Of The Universe and thus naturally allowed to cause any length of inconvenience to we mere mortals without so much as an apology. Or those bar-codes that don't work properly, so the checkout girl spends a good three minutes obsessively passing the object over and over the scanner until it looks like she's conducting an imaginary orchestra. </p> <p> The biggest example of all must be email, by which I remain distinctly underwhelmed. Both times when I attempted to speak to Guardian readers on its website, it took me the same time to receive and answer five e-mail questions as it would have done a dozen faxes. Nevertheless, a massive rush of my fans (80% of whom I'd reckon were calling from work - crusading inertia in the marketplace) caused the sites to collapse; that wouldn't happen to a fax. Most misguided of all must be email shopping. Whereas it would take most people less than an hour to pop out to Dixon's and pick up a simple computer accessory, it took a Mr Jon O'Neill 53 days - 53! - to attempt the same thing on-line, at which point he gave up and is still waiting for a refund for the item that never turned up. </p> <p>If crusading inertia continues to pick up such sluggish speed, I can easily imagine us all in 20 years' time (surrounded by allegedly labour-saving technology but actually going to our graves far younger than our fathers), unable to make human contact, frustrated beyond recall by the sheer, bog-standard bovinity of machines, screaming ourselves into high blood pressure and heart attacks in our little padded cells - each life ending not with a bang, but with a piped version of The Four Seasons. </p> <p>On an altogether cheerier note, the other day I was writing my next novel (Rough Hands, Orion Books, 2001, don't all rush at once) when a pun of such glittering, piquant perfection occurred to me that I had to get up and rush out into the garden simply because the force of my own cleverness forbade me to stay still. Sadly, I now believe that this pun is so gorgeous that it must have been thought of already.

      "body": "<p>Europe and the US injected a note of urgency yesterday into allied attempts to contain conflicts in Kosovo, saying ethnic tensions were flaring dangerously a year after Nato's bombing campaign.</p> <p>After talking to EU leaders in Brussels, the US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, said there was mounting concern about clashes between Serbs and ethnic Albanians in the Kosovan town of Mitrovice.</p> <p>\"The spring has not always been good for the Balkans,\" she said. \"We have been consulting on ways to try to lower the temperature and press extremists not to pursue activities that complicate the situation.\"</p> <p>General Wesley Clark, Nato's supreme commander, warned in London yesterday that Yugoslavia was \"tightening the noose\" on its reluctant federal partner, Montenegro.</p> <p>Speaking at a conference organised by the Foreign Policy Centre, Gen Clark said it was getting harder and harder for K-For peacekeepers to police Kosovo. He said there was growing unrest in the south-eastern part of Serbia proper, where he feared that armed groups of men who claim to be protecting their families could provoke Serb over-reaction. He did not name them, but was referring to bands of ethnic Albanian paramilitaries.</p> <p>Some observers see the current situation as an ominous rerun of events at this time last year - which led to war.</p> <p>While in Brussels Mrs Albright was also seeing Javier Solana, the EU's foreign policy supremo, who wants reassure Washington that rapidly evolving EU defence plans will not undermine the western alliance.</p> <p>She met Mr Solana in his Brussels headquarters, which this week took in the first European army officers ever involved in EU military planning. Earlier, Mr Solana had emphatically told the Guardian that the EU had no intention of creating a \"European army\".</p> <p>\"What we are doing is creating a new capability, but it is not going to be a European army,\" he insisted. \"It's not going to fight wars, it's going to do crisis management.</p> <p>\"The Americans know what we are trying to do. It is not related to the construction of a European army, but we are trying to upgrade the armed forces of the European countries so they can act together.</p> <p>\"We are not talking about making war. We are talking about the establishment of peace and stability. We are not in the business of creating a European army, and we are not in the business of weakening Nato,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Solana, appointed last year to try to boost slow-moving efforts to give the EU greater clout on the world stage, maintained that military plans were moving \"at the speed of light\" compared with the introduction of Europe's single currency.</p> <p>The EU decided at last December's Helsinki summit to establish a 50,000-to 60,000-strong rapid-reaction force capable of deploying within 60 days and sustaining itself for up to a year. This force, to be ready by 2003, would allow Europeans to take action outside Nato, where the US does not wish to be involved.</p> <p>Mrs Albright also urged greater efforts from the EU to support Kosovo's UN administration and police force, which are facing mounting difficulties. But Romano Prodi, the European Commission president, rejected US charges that the EU was not opening its markets to Balkan countries, officials said. The issue is likely to be highlighted at a fundraising conference in Brussels later this month.</p> <p>Mrs Albright refused to be drawn on questions about military planning for Kosovo, but Nato has already said it needs to boost troop strength in its K-For peacekeeping force - currently at 37,400 within the province and 44,000 overall to last summer's level of 49,000.</p> <p>Washington is also pressing the EU for greater efforts to help the reformist Montenegrin president, Milo Djukanovic, who is under acute pressure from Belgrade to abandon any thought of leaving the Yugoslav federation.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Europe and the US injected a note of urgency yesterday into allied attempts to contain conflicts in Kosovo, saying ethnic tensions were flaring dangerously a year after Nato's bombing campaign. After talking to EU leaders in Brussels, the US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, said there was mounting concern about clashes between Serbs and ethnic Albanians in the Kosovan town of Mitrovice. \"The spring has not always been good for the Balkans,\" she said. \"We have been consulting on ways to try to lower the temperature and press extremists not to pursue activities that complicate the situation.\" General Wesley Clark, Nato's supreme commander, warned in London yesterday that Yugoslavia was \"tightening the noose\" on its reluctant federal partner, Montenegro. Speaking at a conference organised by the Foreign Policy Centre, Gen Clark said it was getting harder and harder for K-For peacekeepers to police Kosovo. He said there was growing unrest in the south-eastern part of Serbia proper, where he feared that armed groups of men who claim to be protecting their families could provoke Serb over-reaction. He did not name them, but was referring to bands of ethnic Albanian paramilitaries. Some observers see the current situation as an ominous rerun of events at this time last year - which led to war. While in Brussels Mrs Albright was also seeing Javier Solana, the EU's foreign policy supremo, who wants reassure Washington that rapidly evolving EU defence plans will not undermine the western alliance. She met Mr Solana in his Brussels headquarters, which this week took in the first European army officers ever involved in EU military planning. Earlier, Mr Solana had emphatically told the Guardian that the EU had no intention of creating a \"European army\". \"What we are doing is creating a new capability, but it is not going to be a European army,\" he insisted. \"It's not going to fight wars, it's going to do crisis management. \"The Americans know what we are trying to do. It is not related to the construction of a European army, but we are trying to upgrade the armed forces of the European countries so they can act together. \"We are not talking about making war. We are talking about the establishment of peace and stability. We are not in the business of creating a European army, and we are not in the business of weakening Nato,\" he said. Mr Solana, appointed last year to try to boost slow-moving efforts to give the EU greater clout on the world stage, maintained that military plans were moving \"at the speed of light\" compared with the introduction of Europe's single currency. The EU decided at last December's Helsinki summit to establish a 50,000-to 60,000-strong rapid-reaction force capable of deploying within 60 days and sustaining itself for up to a year. This force, to be ready by 2003, would allow Europeans to take action outside Nato, where the US does not wish to be involved. Mrs Albright also urged greater efforts from the EU to support Kosovo's UN administration and police force, which are facing mounting difficulties. But Romano Prodi, the European Commission president, rejected US charges that the EU was not opening its markets to Balkan countries, officials said. The issue is likely to be highlighted at a fundraising conference in Brussels later this month. Mrs Albright refused to be drawn on questions about military planning for Kosovo, but Nato has already said it needs to boost troop strength in its K-For peacekeeping force - currently at 37,400 within the province and 44,000 overall to last summer's level of 49,000. Washington is also pressing the EU for greater efforts to help the reformist Montenegrin president, Milo Djukanovic, who is under acute pressure from Belgrade to abandon any thought of leaving the Yugoslav federation.",

I opted for the best of both worlds, with music playing second fiddle to a stimulating career in biotechnology - music definitely refreshes the mind after a frustrating day in the lab.</p> <p>However, while there are a wealth of opportunities and diverse career paths out there for scientists, job instability and a succession of temporary contracts are the reality of academic research.</p> <p>My first taste of \"real\" research came during the fourth year of my biochemistry degree at Oxford. The project was based at the Max Planck Institute in Marburg, Germany, and was a far cry from the previous years' practical classes.</p> <p>I looked at enzymes, the proteins catalysing the chemistry of life, isolated from life-forms popularly known as extremeophiles because they live in some of the most inhospitable parts of the planet such as hot, sulphurous springs.</p> <p>These peculiar proteins function under an astonishing range of temperatures and in chemical conditions that would normally destroy most proteins and render them useless. It was an exciting start, but maybe not the most realistic insight into research as the results flowed fast and furious and in three months I didn't get the chance to become disheartened from the frustrations of repeated experimental failure.</p> <p>I did realise that a high level of self-motivation, an inquisitive mind and good investigative skills would be central to success in science. Contributing good results to the group was exciting and rewarding; I was convinced that a PhD was for me.</p> <p>It was the enthusiastic lecturing of Professors Chris Leaver and Hugh Dickinson that led me to consider an alternative avenue of research: the controversial field of plant genetic engineering.</p> <p>I saw an enormous potential for the power of plant biotechnology and wanted to be part of it. Crops could be genetically modified to grow on soils that would normally be too salty or acidic, a problem for much of the developing world, and plants were being engineered to take up and break down harmful contaminants from the environment, a process called phytoremediation.</p> <p>It was the great diversity of research interests, close collaborations with industry and first-rate facilities that attracted me to the Institute of Biotechnology in Cambridge. Current projects range from explosive-eating plants, which have the potential to be used in clean-up operations world-wide, to enzyme engineering.</p> <p>In October 1994 I joined Dr Jim Murray's group as a PhD student. We are attempting to understand how plant growth rate is controlled at the molecular level by looking at genes regulating cell division.</p> <p>We showed that plant growth rate can be increased by optimising the levels of naturally occurring plant regulatory proteins. The plants are more competitive and reach maturity more quickly but other characteristics are not disturbed. This could eventually lead to reduced agrochemical inputs due to improved competitiveness of crops over weeds.</p> <p>Life as a researcher is pretty precarious and has its ups and downs. The results are often baffling and it is easy to get demoralised; positions are temporary and the grant application procedure rears its head every few years. But there are numerous opportunities to work abroad in some of the best research institutions: the world is your oyster.</p> <p>There's also the stereotypical image of the boffin in a white lab coat to contend with. Scientists are perceived to be untrustworthy, anti-social and to lack the ability to communicate their research to the public. Working in such a topical area, it is important to be prepared to explain what you do and the wider implications of it in society.</p> <p>To help resolve this image crisis, I am giving a lecture for science week in Cambridge about the merits of the plant kingdom - from the early uses of plants in medicines to a new agricultural age which could see plants becoming the factories of the future.</p> <p>The road of research is not paved with gold, but it is exciting, interesting, challenging and highly rewarding.</p> <p>\u0095 Dr Claire Cockcroft is at the Institute of Biotechnology in Cambridge.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was a tough decision. Did I follow my musical aspirations or head for a career in science where there appeared to be more opportunities and job stability? I opted for the best of both worlds, with music playing second fiddle to a stimulating career in biotechnology - music definitely refreshes the mind after a frustrating day in the lab. However, while there are a wealth of opportunities and diverse career paths out there for scientists, job instability and a succession of temporary contracts are the reality of academic research. My first taste of \"real\" research came during the fourth year of my biochemistry degree at Oxford. The project was based at the Max Planck Institute in Marburg, Germany, and was a far cry from the previous years' practical classes. I looked at enzymes, the proteins catalysing the chemistry of life, isolated from life-forms popularly known as extremeophiles because they live in some of the most inhospitable parts of the planet such as hot, sulphurous springs. These peculiar proteins function under an astonishing range of temperatures and in chemical conditions that would normally destroy most proteins and render them useless. It was an exciting start, but maybe not the most realistic insight into research as the results flowed fast and furious and in three months I didn't get the chance to become disheartened from the frustrations of repeated experimental failure. I did realise that a high level of self-motivation, an inquisitive mind and good investigative skills would be central to success in science. Contributing good results to the group was exciting and rewarding; I was convinced that a PhD was for me. It was the enthusiastic lecturing of Professors Chris Leaver and Hugh Dickinson that led me to consider an alternative avenue of research: the controversial field of plant genetic engineering. I saw an enormous potential for the power of plant biotechnology and wanted to be part of it. Crops could be genetically modified to grow on soils that would normally be too salty or acidic, a problem for much of the developing world, and plants were being engineered to take up and break down harmful contaminants from the environment, a process called phytoremediation. It was the great diversity of research interests, close collaborations with industry and first-rate facilities that attracted me to the Institute of Biotechnology in Cambridge. Current projects range from explosive-eating plants, which have the potential to be used in clean-up operations world-wide, to enzyme engineering. In October 1994 I joined Dr Jim Murray's group as a PhD student. We are attempting to understand how plant growth rate is controlled at the molecular level by looking at genes regulating cell division. We showed that plant growth rate can be increased by optimising the levels of naturally occurring plant regulatory proteins. The plants are more competitive and reach maturity more quickly but other characteristics are not disturbed. This could eventually lead to reduced agrochemical inputs due to improved competitiveness of crops over weeds. Life as a researcher is pretty precarious and has its ups and downs. The results are often baffling and it is easy to get demoralised; positions are temporary and the grant application procedure rears its head every few years. But there are numerous opportunities to work abroad in some of the best research institutions: the world is your oyster. There's also the stereotypical image of the boffin in a white lab coat to contend with. Scientists are perceived to be untrustworthy, anti-social and to lack the ability to communicate their research to the public. Working in such a topical area, it is important to be prepared to explain what you do and the wider implications of it in society. To help resolve this image crisis, I am giving a lecture for science week in Cambridge about the merits of the plant kingdom - from the early uses of plants in medicines to a new agricultural age which could see plants becoming the factories of the future. The road of research is not paved with gold, but it is exciting, interesting, challenging and highly rewarding. \u0095 Dr Claire Cockcroft is at the Institute of Biotechnology in Cambridge.",

Lots of us drink Newcastle Brown Ale, brewed by Scottish &amp; Newcastle, or Beefeater gin, Tia Maria or Courvoisier, all produced by Allied Domecq. But this week the mandarins who control the make-up of the FTSE 100 shares index called time on these companies and unceremoniously ejected them from the elite group of blue-chip companies that make up the index.</p> <p>Replacing them are a host of companies few will have heard of, let alone bought their products. In comes Baltimore Technologies, which is now worth around \u00a34.5bn even though it has no recorded profits and and issues no dividends. Also coming in are two biotechnology companies, Nycomed Amersham and Celltech.</p> <p>The more techno-aware of us will probably have heard of two other new entrants, internet provider Freeserve and hand-held computer maker Psion. The outgoing companies had profits last year of around \u00a32.1bn, the incoming stocks earned just \u00a3179m.</p> <p>But for an investor in a FTSE 100 tracker fund, it now means that their investment is very heavily geared towards the technology bubble that has inflated the stock market in recent months. It's not just that the \"old economy\" stocks been pushed out. One of the existing FTSE 100 stocks, mobile phone company Vodafone, has grown so massively after its \u00a3107bn takeover of Germany's Mannesman that it alone now makes up 15% of the index. Direct Line, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Alliance &amp; Leicester plus many others have persuaded thousands of investors to buy FTSE 100 tracker funds, but some financial advisers now warn that they may have unwittingly bought into high-risk, hi-tech funds.</p> <p>Jason Hollands of Best Investments says: \"The changes to the FTSE 100 see the exit of several profitable \"old economy\" stocks and their replacement by speculative high-technology businesses.</p> <p>\"While these new FTSE 100 companies are undoubtedly exciting businesses they also carry considerable risks and further exasperate the concentration of the FTSE 100 around TMT themes (technology, media, telecommunciations).</p> <p>\"Given the concentration of the FTSE 100 and the stretched valuations being placed on technology and telecom stocks we believe that index tracker funds - many of which receive the Government's Cat mark endorsement - can no longer be considered as low-risk investments.\"</p> <p>Others are advising that in vestors consider switching to all-share trackers, which follow the fortunes of the 800 companies that make up the All-share index, and will therefore continue to include a broad spread of British companies across different sectors.</p> <p>A spokesman for Virgin Direct, which runs one of the biggest all-share trackers, says: \"We deliberately chose to offer an all-share fund rather than a 100-only fund because it gives investors broader diversification. In an all-share tracker, if the technology stocks blow out, then the out-of-favour stocks that are resting further down the market will then probably come through.\"</p> <p>Giant investment manager Fidelity has also issued a warning this week about the new make-up of the FTSE 100. Investment strategist John Ross says the index is now likely to be more volatile and will pay out lower dividends.</p> <p>\"The companies that are joining the index tend not to make a profit and do not pay a dividend, unlike those leaving the index. Therefore the price earnings ratio for the FTSE 100 will rise and the dividend yield will fall,\" he says.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A warning bell rang for investors in highly-popular FTSE 100 tracker funds after hi-tech companies with sky-high market valuations elbowed some of the grandest names of British industry out of the index. We all know Whitbread pubs. Lots of us drink Newcastle Brown Ale, brewed by Scottish &amp; Newcastle, or Beefeater gin, Tia Maria or Courvoisier, all produced by Allied Domecq. But this week the mandarins who control the make-up of the FTSE 100 shares index called time on these companies and unceremoniously ejected them from the elite group of blue-chip companies that make up the index. Replacing them are a host of companies few will have heard of, let alone bought their products. In comes Baltimore Technologies, which is now worth around \u00a34.5bn even though it has no recorded profits and and issues no dividends. Also coming in are two biotechnology companies, Nycomed Amersham and Celltech. The more techno-aware of us will probably have heard of two other new entrants, internet provider Freeserve and hand-held computer maker Psion. The outgoing companies had profits last year of around \u00a32.1bn, the incoming stocks earned just \u00a3179m. But for an investor in a FTSE 100 tracker fund, it now means that their investment is very heavily geared towards the technology bubble that has inflated the stock market in recent months. It's not just that the \"old economy\" stocks been pushed out. One of the existing FTSE 100 stocks, mobile phone company Vodafone, has grown so massively after its \u00a3107bn takeover of Germany's Mannesman that it alone now makes up 15% of the index. Direct Line, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Alliance &amp; Leicester plus many others have persuaded thousands of investors to buy FTSE 100 tracker funds, but some financial advisers now warn that they may have unwittingly bought into high-risk, hi-tech funds. Jason Hollands of Best Investments says: \"The changes to the FTSE 100 see the exit of several profitable \"old economy\" stocks and their replacement by speculative high-technology businesses. \"While these new FTSE 100 companies are undoubtedly exciting businesses they also carry considerable risks and further exasperate the concentration of the FTSE 100 around TMT themes (technology, media, telecommunciations). \"Given the concentration of the FTSE 100 and the stretched valuations being placed on technology and telecom stocks we believe that index tracker funds - many of which receive the Government's Cat mark endorsement - can no longer be considered as low-risk investments.\" Others are advising that in vestors consider switching to all-share trackers, which follow the fortunes of the 800 companies that make up the All-share index, and will therefore continue to include a broad spread of British companies across different sectors. A spokesman for Virgin Direct, which runs one of the biggest all-share trackers, says: \"We deliberately chose to offer an all-share fund rather than a 100-only fund because it gives investors broader diversification. In an all-share tracker, if the technology stocks blow out, then the out-of-favour stocks that are resting further down the market will then probably come through.\" Giant investment manager Fidelity has also issued a warning this week about the new make-up of the FTSE 100. Investment strategist John Ross says the index is now likely to be more volatile and will pay out lower dividends. \"The companies that are joining the index tend not to make a profit and do not pay a dividend, unlike those leaving the index. Therefore the price earnings ratio for the FTSE 100 will rise and the dividend yield will fall,\" he says.",

In particular, the selection of material and the definitions used could be slanted to suit a company's set of products. For example, Virgin Direct gives a definition of mortgage endowments which highlights the drawbacks: \"They are often unclear how much you are having to pay in charges and the plans are often very rigid.\" Virgin doesn't sell endowments and can therefore tell children about the drawbacks; companies which sell them are unlikely to inform youngsters in the same way. The Personal Finance Education Group, made up of a wide range of financial institutions in partnership with the DfEE, has produced guidelines about what will be expected in money lessons. Children aged 5-7 will learn about what money is, how to recognise coins and notes, risks such as losing it or having it stolen, and how to keep money safe. By the time they hit 14-16 the guidelines suggest they will have to understand a wide range of products such as bank accounts, mortgages, insurance, pensions and shares. They will also have to understand complex issues such as the pros and cons of a company being mutual or owned by shareholders.",

      "body": "<p>Tomorrow morning roughly four million people will plonk themselves in front of the telly to watch Jenson Button in his brand new BMW Williams F1 car become the youngest ever British Formula 1 driver.</p> <p>The 20-year-old Button makes his debut amid a buzz of excitement about Britain's involvement this season. Apart from Mr Button and the first outing for the Williams F1 with its new partner BMW, there is also the debut of Jaguar's new team. Jaguar Racing will provide a ride for two more British drivers: Eddie Irvine and Johnny Herbert. On top of that Irishman Eddie Jordan is full of confidence and expects to better or equal last year's third place behind Ferrari and McLaren Mercedes in this season's constructors' championship. The sport has never been more attractive to young enthusiasts hoping to make it a career. But how do you go about it? It's not the sort of occupation many school careers officers are cut out to deal with.</p> <p>Until recently there were virtually no training or educational programmes specific to the subject. But in the last year several new courses and scholarships - such as the Racecar Engineering/Pilbeam Scholarship which offers a one-year, salaried work placement at Pilbeam Racing Designs - have sprung up to meet the demand from an industry worth \u00a31.5bn in the UK alone. The courses range from B-Tech Higher National Diplomas to an MSc starting this year at Cranfield university. The focus of the courses tends to be on engineering; drivers still have to take a less formal route based primarily on racing experience. But some also teach the student what is involved in managing a racing team, such as business and marketing skills.</p> <p>John Paling, admissions tutor for Derby university's HND in motor sport technology, says Derby may launch a course covering the marketing and commercial side next year. In the meantime, he says, most job opportunities are on the technical side. McLaren gets 3,000 applications a year for design positions, he says, but cannot get enough technicians, responsible for fabrication of components, programming and operating computer-operated machine tools.</p> <p>Derby set up its course after a request from the industry. \"We were approached by a company that races classic cars which asked if we had any engineering students who could support their teams,\" says Mr Paling. Cranfield's course was also designed to meet an industry need, says Clive Temple at the university. The support for the course is illustrated by the \u00a3500,000 invested in it by the Engineering and Physical Research Council and the endorsement by the Motor Sports Association and the Motorsport Industries Association.</p> <p>Mr Paling is confident that students of motor sport will not struggle to find work. \"As long as they are up to standard on the practical side and the academic side they shouldn't have any problem getting a job,\" he says. Mr Paling says he looks for signs that the candidate is a \"natural engineer\" - which seems to translate as a person with a history of tinkering with mechanical devices - and passion. Nav Sidhu, the media manager for Williams F1, the company behind the BMW Williams F1 racing team, says extreme commitment is vital. \"If you are working at an insurance company or a bank the bottom line is that you walk in at 8.30am and out at 6.30pm. In this business it is anything but,\" he says.</p> <p>Williams F1 is estimated to be worth \u00a3300m and employs 400 people who often put in 18-hour days. Motor sport is big business and there are lots of jobs to be done. Williams F1 has departments devoted to engineering, design and testing but it also has a museum and and an IT support team. Mr Sidhu says you do not have to come from a motor sport background to work in these areas of the company. \"There is a misconception that to get into Formula 1 you have to come from Formula 1 and that's not true. We all have to start somewhere. \"</p> <p>Motor sport courses are good news, since they help graduates get a foot in the door and supply the industry with the young talent it is in sore need of. \"The future is youth and there is not a great deal of youth in Formula 1,\" he says. Malcolm Tierney, head of research and development at Jaguar Racing, says the courses are good for those who want go into generalist roles. \"These courses give a good grounding in all the areas that make up a team. They'll allow you to decide which areas you want to go into and give a bit of back ground in the others too,\" he says. Perversely, those who want more specialist jobs should probably go for non-motor sport courses in the relevant subject, he advises.</p> <p>If someone wants a design job in hydraulics - a key area of racing car construction - they need to be a specialist in hydraulics, not a specialist in motor sport or motor sport-related hydraulics, he says.</p> <p>Courses in motorsport are run by Cranfield university (John Nixon, 01234-754152), the university of Derby (John Paling, 01332-591291), Oxford Brookes (Julia Unna, 01865-483500) and Swansea institute of higher education (Roger Dowden, 01792-481168).

      "bodyText": "Tomorrow morning roughly four million people will plonk themselves in front of the telly to watch Jenson Button in his brand new BMW Williams F1 car become the youngest ever British Formula 1 driver. The 20-year-old Button makes his debut amid a buzz of excitement about Britain's involvement this season. Apart from Mr Button and the first outing for the Williams F1 with its new partner BMW, there is also the debut of Jaguar's new team. Jaguar Racing will provide a ride for two more British drivers: Eddie Irvine and Johnny Herbert. On top of that Irishman Eddie Jordan is full of confidence and expects to better or equal last year's third place behind Ferrari and McLaren Mercedes in this season's constructors' championship. The sport has never been more attractive to young enthusiasts hoping to make it a career. But how do you go about it? It's not the sort of occupation many school careers officers are cut out to deal with. Until recently there were virtually no training or educational programmes specific to the subject. But in the last year several new courses and scholarships - such as the Racecar Engineering/Pilbeam Scholarship which offers a one-year, salaried work placement at Pilbeam Racing Designs - have sprung up to meet the demand from an industry worth \u00a31.5bn in the UK alone. The courses range from B-Tech Higher National Diplomas to an MSc starting this year at Cranfield university. The focus of the courses tends to be on engineering; drivers still have to take a less formal route based primarily on racing experience. But some also teach the student what is involved in managing a racing team, such as business and marketing skills. John Paling, admissions tutor for Derby university's HND in motor sport technology, says Derby may launch a course covering the marketing and commercial side next year. In the meantime, he says, most job opportunities are on the technical side. McLaren gets 3,000 applications a year for design positions, he says, but cannot get enough technicians, responsible for fabrication of components, programming and operating computer-operated machine tools. Derby set up its course after a request from the industry. \"We were approached by a company that races classic cars which asked if we had any engineering students who could support their teams,\" says Mr Paling. Cranfield's course was also designed to meet an industry need, says Clive Temple at the university. The support for the course is illustrated by the \u00a3500,000 invested in it by the Engineering and Physical Research Council and the endorsement by the Motor Sports Association and the Motorsport Industries Association. Mr Paling is confident that students of motor sport will not struggle to find work. \"As long as they are up to standard on the practical side and the academic side they shouldn't have any problem getting a job,\" he says. Mr Paling says he looks for signs that the candidate is a \"natural engineer\" - which seems to translate as a person with a history of tinkering with mechanical devices - and passion. Nav Sidhu, the media manager for Williams F1, the company behind the BMW Williams F1 racing team, says extreme commitment is vital. \"If you are working at an insurance company or a bank the bottom line is that you walk in at 8.30am and out at 6.30pm. In this business it is anything but,\" he says. Williams F1 is estimated to be worth \u00a3300m and employs 400 people who often put in 18-hour days. Motor sport is big business and there are lots of jobs to be done. Williams F1 has departments devoted to engineering, design and testing but it also has a museum and and an IT support team. Mr Sidhu says you do not have to come from a motor sport background to work in these areas of the company. \"There is a misconception that to get into Formula 1 you have to come from Formula 1 and that's not true. We all have to start somewhere. \" Motor sport courses are good news, since they help graduates get a foot in the door and supply the industry with the young talent it is in sore need of. \"The future is youth and there is not a great deal of youth in Formula 1,\" he says. Malcolm Tierney, head of research and development at Jaguar Racing, says the courses are good for those who want go into generalist roles. \"These courses give a good grounding in all the areas that make up a team. They'll allow you to decide which areas you want to go into and give a bit of back ground in the others too,\" he says. Perversely, those who want more specialist jobs should probably go for non-motor sport courses in the relevant subject, he advises. If someone wants a design job in hydraulics - a key area of racing car construction - they need to be a specialist in hydraulics, not a specialist in motor sport or motor sport-related hydraulics, he says. Courses in motorsport are run by Cranfield university (John Nixon, 01234-754152), the university of Derby (John Paling, 01332-591291), Oxford Brookes (Julia Unna, 01865-483500) and Swansea institute of higher education (Roger Dowden, 01792-481168). Information about the Pilbeam scholarship is available on 01778-424838.",

      "bodyText": "When did you first become a manager? In 1979, as a very green second-year student at Price Waterhouse. What has been your best moment in management? When we acquired the underlying rights to Thomas the Tank Engine in May 1998. What was your greatest mistake? Not doing the deal much earlier. Which deal would you most like to have done? Negotiating the rights in DOS for Microsoft. What do you find most annoying in your staff? Failure to delegate. Does your organisation have a glass ceiling? No. The sky's the limit. What management wisdom is most overrated? Needing to have 20 or 30 years' experience of an industry. I'd choose a good manager over an experienced manager any day. What is the one lesson you have learned that you would pass on to young managers? Lessons are best learned by making mistakes. Just try not to make them career threatening. Which management guru do you believe in? I don't. I prefer advice from a number of different people. Who is your management hero? Dilbert! Who is your favourite politician? Tony Benn, but I agree with him on very little. How much were you paid last year? Enough to keep the bank manager happy. If you could change one aspect of British business, what would it be? Teach us three foreign languages. What phrase or saying do you most overuse? \"Wow.\" Apart from quality time with your family, what else makes you happiest in life? Good company with good food. What annoys you most? People who stand and chat, surrounded by trolleys, blocking supermarket aisles. How do you relax? Skiing. I have to concentrate so hard I forget everything else. What was your last cultural experience? New York on foot. What is your favourite city? Berlin, before the wall came down. Favourite journey? Going home on a May evening with the bluebells in bloom. What is your greatest regret? Losing touch with old friends - they might win the Lottery one day! What is your biggest fear? Missing last orders at the Tally Ho (my local). What will be the big business issue of the next decade? Managing change. What would you really like to have been? A pathologist.",

      "body": "<p>Everywhere I turn, I see Brian Masters, author of books and articles on Jeffrey Dahmer, Denis Nilsen, Rosemary West and every other murderer in between. I am genuinely worried that I have become as obsessed by Masters as he is by weirdo killers. I watch his every twitch, every bead of sweat on the speckled skin of his bald head, trying to work out what possessed him to go on Newsnight to discuss Dr Harold Shipman's motivations, or on Modern Times to muse on Myra Hindley's culpability.</p> <p>Masters is the guru of extreme motivation: the man who tells us exactly what was going through the killer's head. The one thing that is never explained, however, is why we need to know what was going through the killer's head. It might as well be the Oasis songbook for all the sense it is going to make. Writing on Denis Nilsen, Masters argued that he killed for company. I can just about swallow that this is a kind of explanation for Nilsen's crimes, but it is not an explanation that makes any sense. What can you do with this kind of information - except, perhaps, petition the police to stake-out anyone who has ever placed a lonely hearts ad in case they turn homicidal?</p> <p>There was a time when anyone who asked about motivation was a joke. Literally. The joke was about an actor who spent five hours worrying about his motivation before picking up a glass of water. I cannot remember the punchline, but the point was that actors are stupid. Everyday acts such as eating and drinking require little motivation. The few actions that do are the big questions, the ones that make the drama tick. Why does Iago go after Othello with such demonic fury? There are hundreds of surface reasons, ranging from spite through sexual jealousy to racism, but, at bottom, Iago's motivation is a cold, dark mystery, and a performance that respects this is always more powerful.</p> <p>I often work with actors now, and soon found out that they are far from stupid, at least during office hours. A writer can learn a lot from an actor because they are such careful readers. Maybe this is why so many successful novelists were one-time actors. (And, conversely, why so few editors, critics or academics ever make it as novelists: I've been all three, and talking about books always seems preferable to reading them.) I have never yet heard an actor ask about motivation, but script editors ask it all the time. And because they have to relay the answer upwards, to the money men, there is no room for ambiguity. Motivation is like Apollo 9: it has to be big, it must have a point and everyone has to know where it is going.</p> <p>I was reminded of all the script conferences on motivation I've ever had while watching Anthony Minghella's film version of The Talented Mr Ripley. Clearly, Minghella has become as obsessed by Masters as I have. The key Masters moment comes on a rowing boat, after Ripley has beaten his friend Dickie Greenleaf to death. Ripley drapes one of Dickie's arms over himself, and lies in his embrace until dark. It is only through Dickie's death that Ripley achieves the intimacy he wanted so much when he was alive: in my view, the best use of the \"killing for company\" hypothesis in an adapted screenplay.</p> <p>Minghella easily wins the Masters award (a Master of the Universe action figurine I keep in a drawer), but I would be less happy seeing him receive an Oscar for Ripley. In Patricia Highsmith's original book, Ripley is not homosexual. Instead, he has a fascination for Dickie and his world that is so powerful, it tilts over into erotic desire. When this happens, the basically hetero Ripley is both aware of it and amazed. True, in 1956, when the novel was published, homosexual themes tended to be relegated to the sub-text. But Highsmith continued to write Ripley novels until the late 70s, by which time she had created many gay characters and was widely known to be a lesbian herself. If Ripley was gay, Highsmith would have written him gay. Instead, she gave us a mystery: why is someone with so much intelligence, sensitivity and charisma as Ripley a complete psychopath?</p> <p>Minghella's re-writing of Ripley destroys the mystery by making his motivation transparent. He kills because he cannot come to terms with his homosexuality. He is repressed. Just as the killer in American Beauty is homosexual and repressed. If I were feeling feisty, I would argue that both films are simply dim-witted homophobia wrapped up in psychobabble. But I am not sure they are. In the high-concept world of contemporary cinema, as in the high-concept world of television documentaries and Newsnight features, everything requires a simple motivation. Which is great news for Masters, but not so good for writers, directors or actors. Nor, I suspect, for anyone else. Even in a post-religious world, evil remains a mystery. And mysteries are complex - they require long thought, not short answers.</p> <p>\u0095 Alexander Chancellor is away.</p>",

There are hundreds of surface reasons, ranging from spite through sexual jealousy to racism, but, at bottom, Iago's motivation is a cold, dark mystery, and a performance that respects this is always more powerful. I often work with actors now, and soon found out that they are far from stupid, at least during office hours. A writer can learn a lot from an actor because they are such careful readers. Maybe this is why so many successful novelists were one-time actors. (And, conversely, why so few editors, critics or academics ever make it as novelists: I've been all three, and talking about books always seems preferable to reading them.) I have never yet heard an actor ask about motivation, but script editors ask it all the time. And because they have to relay the answer upwards, to the money men, there is no room for ambiguity. Motivation is like Apollo 9: it has to be big, it must have a point and everyone has to know where it is going. I was reminded of all the script conferences on motivation I've ever had while watching Anthony Minghella's film version of The Talented Mr Ripley. Clearly, Minghella has become as obsessed by Masters as I have. The key Masters moment comes on a rowing boat, after Ripley has beaten his friend Dickie Greenleaf to death. Ripley drapes one of Dickie's arms over himself, and lies in his embrace until dark. It is only through Dickie's death that Ripley achieves the intimacy he wanted so much when he was alive: in my view, the best use of the \"killing for company\" hypothesis in an adapted screenplay. Minghella easily wins the Masters award (a Master of the Universe action figurine I keep in a drawer), but I would be less happy seeing him receive an Oscar for Ripley. In Patricia Highsmith's original book, Ripley is not homosexual. Instead, he has a fascination for Dickie and his world that is so powerful, it tilts over into erotic desire. When this happens, the basically hetero Ripley is both aware of it and amazed. True, in 1956, when the novel was published, homosexual themes tended to be relegated to the sub-text. But Highsmith continued to write Ripley novels until the late 70s, by which time she had created many gay characters and was widely known to be a lesbian herself. If Ripley was gay, Highsmith would have written him gay. Instead, she gave us a mystery: why is someone with so much intelligence, sensitivity and charisma as Ripley a complete psychopath? Minghella's re-writing of Ripley destroys the mystery by making his motivation transparent. He kills because he cannot come to terms with his homosexuality. He is repressed. Just as the killer in American Beauty is homosexual and repressed. If I were feeling feisty, I would argue that both films are simply dim-witted homophobia wrapped up in psychobabble. But I am not sure they are. In the high-concept world of contemporary cinema, as in the high-concept world of television documentaries and Newsnight features, everything requires a simple motivation. Which is great news for Masters, but not so good for writers, directors or actors. Nor, I suspect, for anyone else. Even in a post-religious world, evil remains a mystery. And mysteries are complex - they require long thought, not short answers. \u0095 Alexander Chancellor is away.",

      "body": "<p> Two years ago exactly, I fell in love with a city no one falls in love with. I had gone to Israel to write about the 50th anniversary of the country. I spent the first 24 hours in Tel Aviv holed up in a concrete shoebox of a hotel on the seashore. I stood on my balcony and looked out and what I saw was a dump, a monstrosity, a 60s council estate writ large. But on the second day, drinking my breakfast coffee in the March sunshine, I noticed the curved lines of the dingy apartment buildings along Ha Yarkon Street and something stirred in my memory. I saw that another city was sticking out like the bones of the dead from the ground. Before my eyes an entire Bauhaus town was assembling itself: flat-roofed boxes that had once been white, dazzling white, under the Mediterranean sun; buildings like machines constructed of glass and concrete; clean, uncluttered facades to cleanse the eye; two buildings facing each other on a corner like a pair of ships' prows. </p> <p>The houses now were stained and derelict, overgrown with oleander and hibiscus bushes; palm trees had taken root in the spaces between the lots. All the trash of city living - peeling stucco, air-conditioning vents, skips, electrical cables, natural gas tanks and street signs - obscured the memory that, 60 years ago, Tel Aviv had been conceived as an experiment in modern living by the socialists and other political ideologues who found themselves washed up on the very edge of the Middle East. Tel Aviv still contains the largest collection of Bauhaus architecture in the world: 6,500 buildings. It is a monument to the age of Modernism. Who designed and constructed these places? Who lived in them? I was avid to know and determined to find out. </p> <p>I went to the Tel Aviv Municipal Museum. Closed two years ago. I went to the Art Museum, where tours of the Bauhaus architecture of the city were advertised in my guide book. Discontinued. An exhibition on the Bauhaus architecture of Tel Aviv had taken place in the 80s and a catalogue had been published. It was out of print. If you type the word Jerusalem into the online bookseller Amazon's search engine, you'll get 495 hits. Type in Tel Aviv and you get 10, only four of which are in print - of those, one is a map and another the proceedings of an astronomy conference. I asked in Steimatsky, the Israeli bookstore chain, if they could recommend novels set in Tel Aviv. A young assistant said that he could think of none. David Grossman and Amos Oz were rooted in Jerusalem. The people of Tel Aviv were suffering collective amnesia about their city's history. </p> <p>By this time I was sure that I would write a novel set in this mysterious city that appeared to have no memory of its own past. Months later, I came to see that Tel Aviv was a metaphor. It stood for the flawed aspirations of its founders, who in 1909 assembled on a sand-dune north of the Arab town of Jaffa and dreamed of creating the first Jewish metropolis since biblical times. They were turning their backs against the past towards the future. They were trying to reinvent themselves for the 20th century in a longing much bigger than political nationalism. In building the new city, they wanted to rebuild the new Jew from the ground up, but in so doing they had built into their vision an abandonment of their history. The state of the Bauhaus city today speaks both of the dreams and of the in-built failures of Modernism. </p> <p>It took months of tramping the streets and examining the archives of the Palestine Post (the forerunner to the Jerusalem Post) to discover what the inhabitants of the city themselves could not tell me. Tel Aviv has its origins in a decision in 1887 to build a Jewish suburb just outside Jaffa, in a neighbourhood called Neve Tsedek. Small, mainly one-storey houses were constructed in a Mediterranean style. By 1909, they had overflowed the new area and on April 11 a group of 66 families, calling themselves the Achusath Bayit housing association, gathered on the sand-dunes of what was then known as Sheikh Jibalis Vineyard, after the owner from whom the land had been purchased.</p> <p> They were in buoyant mood because they had just heard news from Odessa that Chaim Nachman Bialik, the most celebrated Hebrew poet of his day, was asking to join them. The group's leader, Meier Dizengoff, later to become the fledgling town's first mayor, organised a lot-drawing ceremony, using 60 pebbles bearing the names of each family and 60 more pebbles marked with the number of the building plot. (What happened to the other six families is unrecorded.) </p> <p>After a long discussion about the name of the new town, they settled on Tel Aviv, the Hebrew translation of Altneuland, a utopian novel by the Zionist leader and journalist Theodor Herzl, whose coverage of the Dreyfus trial in France had led to the founding of the Zionist Congress. Altneuland meant old and new land. Tel means an excavated mound, signifying the remains of old settlements; aviv is the first sprouting of new wheat. The construction work was carried out by Arab labourers and supplies were transported by camel, but the founders were already conceiving Tel Aviv as the opposite of Jaffa. Where Jaffa had history and ancient stones, Tel Aviv would be brash, new, a work-in-progress. To one observer, Jaffa seemed a dozen centuries and 10,000 miles away. </p> <p>During the first world war, the population of the still embryonic city was evacuated and the return began only after General Allenby (after whom the principal street would be named) re-took it at the head of a victorious British Army. The earliest architects came from Russia, and their style was influenced not only by what they had left behind, but also by the fashion for Orientalism that swept the West in the aftermath of the opening of the tomb of Tutankhamun.</p> <p> Until 1925, there was no development plan. Tel Aviv was mushrooming with what one observer described as \"a shocking mixture of forms and plans and a fray of shoving, queue-jumping wills which personify the immense revolution that has taken place on the sand-dunes\". A German visitor in 1924 wrote that \"all aesthetically-minded people are beside themselves with horror at the ugliness and tastelessness and banality... but I am impressed by the pace of things here, by the colossal vitality which this town has about it.\" </p> <p>In the 30s, suddenly, in place of random development, of buildings commissioned by individuals to suit their own overblown and untutored fantasies, there was real urgency about housing. The population of Zionist pioneers - part of the turn-of-the century pogrom emigration that would take millions of Jews from eastern Europe to America - were joined by another and very different band of immigrants. </p> <p>In Tel Aviv in those days, there was a common saying you could hear in the cafes along the Allenby Road: \"I didn't come here from conviction, I came here from Germany.\" The speakers were the Yekkes, the German Jews who, forced out of their country by fascism, saw cities such as London as the desired place of their exodus but could only get visas to Palestine, regarded by many as a primitive Oriental dump populated, apart from Arabs, by Oestjuden - Jews from the east, Poland and Russia. The Oestjuden, for their part, gave the German Jews their nickname, the Yekkes, because it was both the Hebrew word for jacket that the formal German Jews never took off, even in the stifling heat of the summer, and because it was an acronym for the words Yehudi Kashe Havanah - Jews who don't understand. </p> <p>What was it that they could not comprehend? Many of the Yekkes were far from being Zionists. They were in Palestine on sufferance and determined that, come what may, they would do their best to re-create on the edge of the desert a new Berlin. They were not the scum of the east European shtetls, rabbis at best, beetroot farmers at worst, but saw themselves as the Weimar Republic in exile. Many were businessmen, doctors and lawyers who struggled to make a living in a town bloated with unemployed professionals. Some could only find work as window-cleaners and labourers, and these were the first to volunteer to fight in whatever army would take them when the second world war finally began. Others started shops on the Allenby Road, and attempted to introduce the chic styles of Berlin and Vienna to a country of pioneers who prided themselves on having drained malaria-ridden swamps. </p> <p> Advertisements in the Palestine Post indicate the desperation of German ladies offering translation services and dancing lessons. Others still would import to their adopted homeland every progressive thought that had thrived in Germany before fascism: socialism, feminism, psychoanalysis, the new art and the new architecture. Above all, they were Modernists, and not only in the sense that they were living in one of the newest cities on earth, but also because they subscribed to an intellectual and artistic movement. It was for these unwilling immigrants that the White City, as it came to be called, was created. </p> <p>On the one hand, there was a desperate need for housing, on the other a glut of unemployed architects trained at the Bauhaus in the International Style. Gradually, an entire Bauhaus city took shape along the shoreline, but subtly different from one that might have been built in Germany. Walls existed not so much for privacy but as barriers against the blinding Mediterranean light. Windows were narrow and recessed, each with a balcony shaded by the balcony above it so that, in those days before air- conditioning, the residents could sit out and catch the breeze from the shore. Later, they built on pilotis, slim columns that allowed the dust and dirt from the road to blow under the house instead of rushing at the doors and windows. </p> <p>Excitement at this new architecture was at fever pitch. Families came with picnics at the weekend to sit on the street and watch the buildings under construction; the noisy work of drills and cement mixers, the hammering and the shouting in the hot air seemed all the more miraculous when they considered that 20 years before there was nothing there at all. For the many who were not ideological Zionists, it was not the dream of the Jewish homeland that excited them, but the notion of a brand new Jewish city, complete with library, art gallery and symphony orchestra. Such was the influx of musicians prohibited from playing for German orchestras at home that another saying became common in the 30s: \"Anyone arriving from the boat without a violin case must be a pianist.\" </p> <p>In contrast to the radio, which brought only bad news from home, Tel Aviv was the Jews' affirmation that there was a future, and one visibly growing before their eyes. Someone remarked that Allenby Street seemed to be getting longer even as he walked along it. In the 30s, a journalist wrote in a newspaper for German-speaking immigrants: \"Not everyone can spend the whole of his natural life in a tragedy of sacrifice. For this majority of people there needs to be a Tel Aviv.\" If Jaffa was the world's oldest working port, the biblical city from where Jonah set sail for Tarsus on the ill-fated journey that would see him swallowed by the whale, Tel Aviv was the shock of the new, of the present tense and the future merging, moment by moment. </p> <p>Modernism was a unified and universal concept, one that could be applied to art, architecture, music, literature, dress and even political thought. Modernism's mandate was to reject the past and reject the notion that one regime was as good as the next. Everything outmoded and outdated was to be abandoned: representational painting, buildings with decoration, symphonies with tunes, and literature steaming with purple prose. Understanding this, it is not surprising that the refugees from Germany were almost entirely uninterested in Arab culture. This was left to the British, and Miss Violet Barber, who established a folk museum in Jerusalem that collected specimens of local interest. </p> <p>At their most enlightened, the Yekkes hoped that they could bring progressive ideas to the benighted peoples of the Middle East. They wanted to rid them of undemocratic practices, the subordination of women and feudal land rights, and open their eyes to 20th-century life. That this mission might be inherently colonial never occurred to them. They were unabashed elitists who believed wholeheartedly in the innate superiority of their ideas. Theirs was not a time when the plurality of cultures was respected. </p> <p>Looking for Tel Aviv's past, I had spent a day with a woman I won't name, for she wasn't giving me an interview for publication. She was born in 1914, already a socialist and a feminist when, at the age of 19 in Berlin, she saw, in April 1933, the first window of a Jewish shop being smashed by Nazis and left Germany forever the following month. Today, she volunteers at a Jerusalem human-rights organisation, monitoring details of atrocities committed by the Israeli state. She votes in the general elections for Hadash, the Arab/Jewish communist party, and in the local elections for the Arab lists. \"I am not a Zionist,\" she told me. When, in May 1948, Ben Gurion declared the state of Israel, she stood on the street and wept, knowing that she was now a citizen of a country she thought had no right to exist. </p> <p>But when I asked her about what she read, she replied, only English literature, \"the greatest in the world\". Which authors? William Trevor and Jennifer Johnston. I pointed out that they were Irish. It was, she told me, the same thing. I asked her if she read Israel's great novelists, Amos Oz and David Grossman. \"Oestjuden,\" she replied. I told her that I, the daughter of Polish and Russian shtetl immigrants, was also an Oestjude. She was surprised. I seemed to her quite cultivated. She was a snob and an elitist, and she embodied, on the one hand, a faultless list of left-wing anti-Zionist credentials, and on the other the mistake inherent in any deep-seated belief in the shining utopian future: that it must be imposed on others for their own good. </p> <p>To the rest of the Jewish population of Palestine, the Yekkes were the object of suspicion: \"Instead of a heart, they have a clock,\" was another saying. The absence of ardent Zionism was another strike against them. Had it not been for fascism, the Yekkes would have stayed comfortably in Berlin and Vienna, assimilated, loyal, quintessentially European in their outlook. Elsewhere, the political factions intent on ridding Palestine of the British were arming themselves for guerrilla war and had little time for art and orchestras. To them, Tel Aviv had an entirely different function. </p> <p>Jerusalem was the headquarters of the British Mandate, it was a British-controlled town, in which the British had their own cultural stake, for it was the capital of another parallel country, the Holy Land. Jerusalem was stuffed full of sites of Christian pilgrimage and worship; Tel Aviv had nothing. One Mandate official described it as \"gruesomely go-ahead\". </p> <p>A German guidebook still in use today speaks about the non-Jewish revulsion for the city: \"In Tel Aviv... there is nothing capable of distracting you from the encounter with Jewishness, there are no sites of antiquity to visit, and no heroic land scapes, let alone any spectacular sites of pilgrimage which might put up some sort of cultural protective screen between you and the Jew.\" </p> <p>Reading AH Sherman's Mandate Days, a collection of letters and diaries of British officials, one is struck by how their sympathies naturally seemed to lie with the Arab population, whose traditional virtues of courtesy, hospitality, good manners, a ritualised code of behaviour where much was left unsaid, and a conspicuous absence of women, chimed not only with public-school life but also with a prevailing admiration for the writings of TE Lawrence. </p> <p>By contrast, the Jews were perceived as noisy, ill-mannered, over-talkative and bolshie in both senses of the word. The common complaint about present-day Israeli rudeness in contrast to the more likeable attributes of the Palestinians has some roots in the perseverance of this predilection. Tel Aviv was the stronghold of the new Jew, who saw no reason to practise subservience to Christians when they didn't have to. The new Jew prided himself or herself on speaking bluntly and to the point. Either they were experimenting with ideas that were never to catch on in England - dispensing with history, for example - or they were waging a covert war against the British. Neither was an attractive proposition to the Mandate civil servants and policemen, for whom a posting to Palestine had been viewed from home as an opportunity to walk in the footsteps of the Messiah. </p> <p>Tel Aviv was the headquarters of the terrorists who were trying to drive the British out. When the second world war started, the city became the recreation centre for a variety of armies stationed in the Middle East. Officers' clubs mushroomed along the waterfront. When the war ended, and the campaign against British rule resumed, whole sections of Tel Aviv were deemed no-go areas for British troops. Bombs went off all over the place at unexpected hours. Kidnappings and curfews were commonplace. </p> <p>I talked to Yasaf Nachmayas, a veteran of the Irgun, the Zionist terrorist organisation, who spoke reverently of Menachim Begin - the Irgun's leader and later one of Israel's most intransigent of right-wing prime ministers - as \"my captain\". Nachmayas came from a family that had been in Palestine for six generations, arriving there from Sarajevo at the end of the 18th century, he thought. He regarded the Arab population as the enemy, pure and simple. The two were fighting over the same bit of land, what could you do? He had no ill-feelings towards the Arabs, no agenda to \"improve\" them. I asked him what he made of the country he had fought for. His faced turned sad, very suddenly. \"I didn't think there would be the intolerance,\" he replied. </p> <p>In the aftermath of the bombing of the King David Hotel, in Jerusalem in 1946, the perpetrators fled to Tel Aviv. The history of the war against the British for the state is contained in the city's small museums, which document the exploits of each faction: Haganah, Irgun, Lehi. Even before the British pulled out, there was a tacit acceptance that they had lost the war in Tel Aviv. The police force was overwhelmingly Jewish and the terrorists had infiltrated it with a network of informers. Nachmayas' value to the Irgun was that he spoke fluent, accentless English and was used to impersonate British soldiers when the Irgun needed to get access to the enemies' arms storehouses. The Irgun radio transmitter was in his parents' apartment, somewhere in the White City. </p> <p>In May 1948, when he was ready to declare the new state of Israel, after receiving the go-ahead from the United Nations, Ben Gurion looked for a building in which to make the announcement. He chose the art museum on Rothschild Boulevard, the first house to have been built in Tel Aviv, then owned by the city's first mayor, Meier Dizengoff, who in the 20s would ride out every morning on a white horse to inspect his domain. It is said that the museum's director was ordered to take down the paintings of nude women from the walls so as not to offend the rabbis and other puritanical members of the Zionist executive. The building is now a museum of the beginning of the Israeli state. If you ask the grumpy curator, he will let you watch an English-language film about the history of the city. You see footage of the news of the birth of Israel being received by a crowd in Times Square. Watching it, I thought of my parents in Liverpool, seated by their wireless in their honeymoon flat, hearing the same news. I thought of a Polish couple I had met in a caf\u00e9 in Haifa, holding hands in the sunshine. They heard it in a Displaced Persons camp in Italy to which they had been moved from the work camp in Russia where they had met. </p> <p>I had wanted to try to get inside the minds of those who lacked the benefit of hindsight; who thought that the recent past was a nightmare they could turn their backs on. I came to see that they never, in a million years, thought of themselves as thieves, as people who had stolen another people's country. In his book 1949: The First Israelis, the Israeli journalist Tom Segev writes of the extraordinary reunions that would take place in those early days - mothers bumping into sons they had not seen for 14 years, sisters reunited by newspaper advertisements. The heartrending radio programme, Who Recognises, Who Knows, sent out plaintive messages into the ether in case they might find a relative, not gassed or shot, but miraculously residing in a boxy white building on Frishman Street. </p> <p>These were the days before the Holocaust industry. The past was a total nightmare, the present a grim struggle as the new state tried to feed and house and find work for the swollen population. The future was the only tense in which they could place their faith. But Tel Aviv never became a new Berlin. </p> <p>Even in the 30s, another group of immigrants was arriving from Yemen: Jews who had never left the biblical lands. After 1948, and the beginning of the long wars with the Arab world, an influx of immigrants from North Africa, Iran, Iraq and Turkey introduced the Yekkes to Jews who were even further removed than the Oestjuden from their conception of what was European. These Sephardim saw themselves treated with disdain by the Ashkenazi, the European Jews who dominated left-of-centre political parties. Tel Aviv's Sephardi neighbourhoods are today strongholds of the Likud and Shas, the ultra-Orthodox religious party. </p> <p>But none of this could account for the physical decline of the White City. One day, on my third visit in seven months, the manager of the bookshop in the Tel Aviv Museum of Art called me back when I had found out that the catalogue of the Bauhaus exhibition was no longer in print. \"Wait,\" she called out. \"You have no initiative.\" Why, she asked me, didn't I call the author of the book, Dr Michael Levin, a professor at the Bezalel art school in Jerusalem. When I rang him, he invited me to his house. He had been born in Jerusalem in 1943. We spoke for hours about Tel Aviv, and gradually its history was revealed to me. </p> <p>He told me that, when he was a child, he asked his father why it was that in Tel Aviv they sat out in cafes in the evening (Tel Aviv today remains a city where a cafe is to be found on every street corner). The answer was in the nature of the architecture. A decree by the mayor of Jerusalem in the 20s had forced every new building to be constructed of Jerusalem stone, ideal for the climate, for it absorbed heat slowly. In Tel Aviv, they built with concrete. The sun oozed through the walls and by the evening the brand new apartments, those supposed machines for modern living, were like hothouses, driving people out of doors. And where to go, asked the Yekkes, if not to cafes that they nostalgically remembered from Berlin? </p> <p>This was one way in which the faulty architecture had influenced the lifestyle of the new city, but idealism was also to be the source of its destruction. When the Yekkes arrived in Tel Aviv, some had managed to evade the Nazi stripping of their financial assets. Facing unemployment, they had a sum of money, which they invested by commissioning the construction of an apartment building. They would reside in one flat and live on the rents from the others. But at the end of the war, the municipal council passed rent-control acts and suddenly the owners found that they could barely live off their receipts, let alone maintain the buildings that were already corroding in the salt air from the sea. Almost nothing was understood about long-term maintenance, Dr Levin told me. So the long decline began, barely a decade after the White City rose from the sand. </p> <p>Tel Aviv today is a divided city. Ha Yarkon Street, where once Arthur Koestler was kept awake by noisy gramophones from the officers' clubs along the shore, is no longer open to the sea. A row of five-star hotels, constructed in the 60s and 70s, acts as a barrier, blocking the breeze. Pink condominiums overshadow what remains of the White City. The focus is on the marina and the esplanade, where you can watch the early-morning joggers take their exercise. Many of them work in the skyscrapers of the stock exchange, built over the Arab neighbourhood of Manshieh that was destroyed in the 1948 war. By the bus station, there is a shanty-town of shacks, a little city of illegal immigrants from the Third World to whom Tel Aviv is also a dream: not of the first Jewish city for 2,000 years, but of an opportunity, like any other, for a new life in a prosperous country. </p> <p>Just as I was finishing my novel, something new appeared on the Amazon search engine when once again I typed in the words Tel Aviv. It was a book called Tel Aviv: From Dream To Reality, by a man called Joachim Schlor, and published by Reaktion Books. Schlor is a German non-Jew and he, too, had fallen in love with Tel Aviv. \"No feature of special interest arrests the eye,\" the book begins. \"Yet the streets themselves are beautiful, and it is only by wandering through them again and again, curious, observant and aiming for nowhere in particular, that one can truly get to know Tel Aviv.\" And on the next page I read: \"I wish that more of the many people in Western Europe who engage in debate about Israel and the Middle Eastern conflict would make contact with this contemporary city, would question it and listen to it.\" </p> <p>Schlor's book, not mine, is the history Tel Aviv has been waiting for. Yet we begin from the same starting point, that in that city which still has inhabitants who are older than itself, lie the paradoxes of many things: of Modernism, of Jewish identity, of political idealism, as well as of the Israeli state. To be a new Jew was to be a paradox: the people who instead of a land had had a story, a narrative of their existence, had decided that it was only the future that counted. They were fatally wrong. One of the tragedies of Israel is not just what was done to the Palestinians, but what the Jews did to themselves: they wanted to rid themselves of the memories of the diaspora. \"They crave,\" wrote one observer quoted by Schlor, \"to get away from their past and to put out of their mind all the marks of indignity, all the stigmata of shame, all the yellow patches that Jew-hatred has ever devised. They even crave to put out of their mind part of their own mind.\" </p> <p>Still Tel Aviv enchants me. The present urban mess that is the city speaks for the country. Like Israel, it turned out, in Tom Segev's words, \"less enlightened, less idealistic, less altruistic and less Ashkenazi than the [founders] had hoped... the future would promise neither justice for all, nor equality for all, nor peace. Perhaps the first Israelis never recognised this. Absorbed in euphoria, they failed to see the reality as it was... but the road they took was the road they believed to be right, and they followed it with wholehearted confidence and belief in their cause. For that, they are to be envied.\" </p> <p>All dreams are chaotic, seldom peaceful and have a tendency sometimes to turn into nightmares. But if you walk Tel Aviv's streets and listen to its people, you catch a glimpse of what the ghosts thought they were building </p>",

      "bodyText": "Two years ago exactly, I fell in love with a city no one falls in love with. I had gone to Israel to write about the 50th anniversary of the country. I spent the first 24 hours in Tel Aviv holed up in a concrete shoebox of a hotel on the seashore. I stood on my balcony and looked out and what I saw was a dump, a monstrosity, a 60s council estate writ large. But on the second day, drinking my breakfast coffee in the March sunshine, I noticed the curved lines of the dingy apartment buildings along Ha Yarkon Street and something stirred in my memory. I saw that another city was sticking out like the bones of the dead from the ground. Before my eyes an entire Bauhaus town was assembling itself: flat-roofed boxes that had once been white, dazzling white, under the Mediterranean sun; buildings like machines constructed of glass and concrete; clean, uncluttered facades to cleanse the eye; two buildings facing each other on a corner like a pair of ships' prows. The houses now were stained and derelict, overgrown with oleander and hibiscus bushes; palm trees had taken root in the spaces between the lots. All the trash of city living - peeling stucco, air-conditioning vents, skips, electrical cables, natural gas tanks and street signs - obscured the memory that, 60 years ago, Tel Aviv had been conceived as an experiment in modern living by the socialists and other political ideologues who found themselves washed up on the very edge of the Middle East. Tel Aviv still contains the largest collection of Bauhaus architecture in the world: 6,500 buildings. It is a monument to the age of Modernism. Who designed and constructed these places? Who lived in them? I was avid to know and determined to find out. I went to the Tel Aviv Municipal Museum. Closed two years ago. I went to the Art Museum, where tours of the Bauhaus architecture of the city were advertised in my guide book. Discontinued. An exhibition on the Bauhaus architecture of Tel Aviv had taken place in the 80s and a catalogue had been published. It was out of print. If you type the word Jerusalem into the online bookseller Amazon's search engine, you'll get 495 hits. Type in Tel Aviv and you get 10, only four of which are in print - of those, one is a map and another the proceedings of an astronomy conference. I asked in Steimatsky, the Israeli bookstore chain, if they could recommend novels set in Tel Aviv. A young assistant said that he could think of none. David Grossman and Amos Oz were rooted in Jerusalem. The people of Tel Aviv were suffering collective amnesia about their city's history. By this time I was sure that I would write a novel set in this mysterious city that appeared to have no memory of its own past. Months later, I came to see that Tel Aviv was a metaphor. It stood for the flawed aspirations of its founders, who in 1909 assembled on a sand-dune north of the Arab town of Jaffa and dreamed of creating the first Jewish metropolis since biblical times. They were turning their backs against the past towards the future. They were trying to reinvent themselves for the 20th century in a longing much bigger than political nationalism. In building the new city, they wanted to rebuild the new Jew from the ground up, but in so doing they had built into their vision an abandonment of their history. The state of the Bauhaus city today speaks both of the dreams and of the in-built failures of Modernism. It took months of tramping the streets and examining the archives of the Palestine Post (the forerunner to the Jerusalem Post) to discover what the inhabitants of the city themselves could not tell me. Tel Aviv has its origins in a decision in 1887 to build a Jewish suburb just outside Jaffa, in a neighbourhood called Neve Tsedek. Small, mainly one-storey houses were constructed in a Mediterranean style. By 1909, they had overflowed the new area and on April 11 a group of 66 families, calling themselves the Achusath Bayit housing association, gathered on the sand-dunes of what was then known as Sheikh Jibalis Vineyard, after the owner from whom the land had been purchased. They were in buoyant mood because they had just heard news from Odessa that Chaim Nachman Bialik, the most celebrated Hebrew poet of his day, was asking to join them. The group's leader, Meier Dizengoff, later to become the fledgling town's first mayor, organised a lot-drawing ceremony, using 60 pebbles bearing the names of each family and 60 more pebbles marked with the number of the building plot. (What happened to the other six families is unrecorded.) After a long discussion about the name of the new town, they settled on Tel Aviv, the Hebrew translation of Altneuland, a utopian novel by the Zionist leader and journalist Theodor Herzl, whose coverage of the Dreyfus trial in France had led to the founding of the Zionist Congress. Altneuland meant old and new land. Tel means an excavated mound, signifying the remains of old settlements; aviv is the first sprouting of new wheat. The construction work was carried out by Arab labourers and supplies were transported by camel, but the founders were already conceiving Tel Aviv as the opposite of Jaffa. Where Jaffa had history and ancient stones, Tel Aviv would be brash, new, a work-in-progress. To one observer, Jaffa seemed a dozen centuries and 10,000 miles away. During the first world war, the population of the still embryonic city was evacuated and the return began only after General Allenby (after whom the principal street would be named) re-took it at the head of a victorious British Army. The earliest architects came from Russia, and their style was influenced not only by what they had left behind, but also by the fashion for Orientalism that swept the West in the aftermath of the opening of the tomb of Tutankhamun. Until 1925, there was no development plan. Tel Aviv was mushrooming with what one observer described as \"a shocking mixture of forms and plans and a fray of shoving, queue-jumping wills which personify the immense revolution that has taken place on the sand-dunes\". A German visitor in 1924 wrote that \"all aesthetically-minded people are beside themselves with horror at the ugliness and tastelessness and banality... but I am impressed by the pace of things here, by the colossal vitality which this town has about it.\" In the 30s, suddenly, in place of random development, of buildings commissioned by individuals to suit their own overblown and untutored fantasies, there was real urgency about housing. The population of Zionist pioneers - part of the turn-of-the century pogrom emigration that would take millions of Jews from eastern Europe to America - were joined by another and very different band of immigrants. In Tel Aviv in those days, there was a common saying you could hear in the cafes along the Allenby Road: \"I didn't come here from conviction, I came here from Germany.\" The speakers were the Yekkes, the German Jews who, forced out of their country by fascism, saw cities such as London as the desired place of their exodus but could only get visas to Palestine, regarded by many as a primitive Oriental dump populated, apart from Arabs, by Oestjuden - Jews from the east, Poland and Russia. The Oestjuden, for their part, gave the German Jews their nickname, the Yekkes, because it was both the Hebrew word for jacket that the formal German Jews never took off, even in the stifling heat of the summer, and because it was an acronym for the words Yehudi Kashe Havanah - Jews who don't understand. What was it that they could not comprehend? Many of the Yekkes were far from being Zionists. They were in Palestine on sufferance and determined that, come what may, they would do their best to re-create on the edge of the desert a new Berlin. They were not the scum of the east European shtetls, rabbis at best, beetroot farmers at worst, but saw themselves as the Weimar Republic in exile. Many were businessmen, doctors and lawyers who struggled to make a living in a town bloated with unemployed professionals. Some could only find work as window-cleaners and labourers, and these were the first to volunteer to fight in whatever army would take them when the second world war finally began. Others started shops on the Allenby Road, and attempted to introduce the chic styles of Berlin and Vienna to a country of pioneers who prided themselves on having drained malaria-ridden swamps. Advertisements in the Palestine Post indicate the desperation of German ladies offering translation services and dancing lessons. Others still would import to their adopted homeland every progressive thought that had thrived in Germany before fascism: socialism, feminism, psychoanalysis, the new art and the new architecture. Above all, they were Modernists, and not only in the sense that they were living in one of the newest cities on earth, but also because they subscribed to an intellectual and artistic movement. It was for these unwilling immigrants that the White City, as it came to be called, was created. On the one hand, there was a desperate need for housing, on the other a glut of unemployed architects trained at the Bauhaus in the International Style. Gradually, an entire Bauhaus city took shape along the shoreline, but subtly different from one that might have been built in Germany. Walls existed not so much for privacy but as barriers against the blinding Mediterranean light. Windows were narrow and recessed, each with a balcony shaded by the balcony above it so that, in those days before air- conditioning, the residents could sit out and catch the breeze from the shore. Later, they built on pilotis, slim columns that allowed the dust and dirt from the road to blow under the house instead of rushing at the doors and windows. Excitement at this new architecture was at fever pitch. Families came with picnics at the weekend to sit on the street and watch the buildings under construction; the noisy work of drills and cement mixers, the hammering and the shouting in the hot air seemed all the more miraculous when they considered that 20 years before there was nothing there at all. For the many who were not ideological Zionists, it was not the dream of the Jewish homeland that excited them, but the notion of a brand new Jewish city, complete with library, art gallery and symphony orchestra. Such was the influx of musicians prohibited from playing for German orchestras at home that another saying became common in the 30s: \"Anyone arriving from the boat without a violin case must be a pianist.\" In contrast to the radio, which brought only bad news from home, Tel Aviv was the Jews' affirmation that there was a future, and one visibly growing before their eyes. Someone remarked that Allenby Street seemed to be getting longer even as he walked along it. In the 30s, a journalist wrote in a newspaper for German-speaking immigrants: \"Not everyone can spend the whole of his natural life in a tragedy of sacrifice. For this majority of people there needs to be a Tel Aviv.\" If Jaffa was the world's oldest working port, the biblical city from where Jonah set sail for Tarsus on the ill-fated journey that would see him swallowed by the whale, Tel Aviv was the shock of the new, of the present tense and the future merging, moment by moment. Modernism was a unified and universal concept, one that could be applied to art, architecture, music, literature, dress and even political thought. Modernism's mandate was to reject the past and reject the notion that one regime was as good as the next. Everything outmoded and outdated was to be abandoned: representational painting, buildings with decoration, symphonies with tunes, and literature steaming with purple prose. Understanding this, it is not surprising that the refugees from Germany were almost entirely uninterested in Arab culture. This was left to the British, and Miss Violet Barber, who established a folk museum in Jerusalem that collected specimens of local interest. At their most enlightened, the Yekkes hoped that they could bring progressive ideas to the benighted peoples of the Middle East. They wanted to rid them of undemocratic practices, the subordination of women and feudal land rights, and open their eyes to 20th-century life. That this mission might be inherently colonial never occurred to them. They were unabashed elitists who believed wholeheartedly in the innate superiority of their ideas. Theirs was not a time when the plurality of cultures was respected. Looking for Tel Aviv's past, I had spent a day with a woman I won't name, for she wasn't giving me an interview for publication. She was born in 1914, already a socialist and a feminist when, at the age of 19 in Berlin, she saw, in April 1933, the first window of a Jewish shop being smashed by Nazis and left Germany forever the following month. Today, she volunteers at a Jerusalem human-rights organisation, monitoring details of atrocities committed by the Israeli state. She votes in the general elections for Hadash, the Arab/Jewish communist party, and in the local elections for the Arab lists. \"I am not a Zionist,\" she told me. When, in May 1948, Ben Gurion declared the state of Israel, she stood on the street and wept, knowing that she was now a citizen of a country she thought had no right to exist. But when I asked her about what she read, she replied, only English literature, \"the greatest in the world\". Which authors? William Trevor and Jennifer Johnston. I pointed out that they were Irish. It was, she told me, the same thing. I asked her if she read Israel's great novelists, Amos Oz and David Grossman. \"Oestjuden,\" she replied. I told her that I, the daughter of Polish and Russian shtetl immigrants, was also an Oestjude. She was surprised. I seemed to her quite cultivated. She was a snob and an elitist, and she embodied, on the one hand, a faultless list of left-wing anti-Zionist credentials, and on the other the mistake inherent in any deep-seated belief in the shining utopian future: that it must be imposed on others for their own good. To the rest of the Jewish population of Palestine, the Yekkes were the object of suspicion: \"Instead of a heart, they have a clock,\" was another saying. The absence of ardent Zionism was another strike against them. Had it not been for fascism, the Yekkes would have stayed comfortably in Berlin and Vienna, assimilated, loyal, quintessentially European in their outlook. Elsewhere, the political factions intent on ridding Palestine of the British were arming themselves for guerrilla war and had little time for art and orchestras. To them, Tel Aviv had an entirely different function. Jerusalem was the headquarters of the British Mandate, it was a British-controlled town, in which the British had their own cultural stake, for it was the capital of another parallel country, the Holy Land. Jerusalem was stuffed full of sites of Christian pilgrimage and worship; Tel Aviv had nothing. One Mandate official described it as \"gruesomely go-ahead\". A German guidebook still in use today speaks about the non-Jewish revulsion for the city: \"In Tel Aviv... there is nothing capable of distracting you from the encounter with Jewishness, there are no sites of antiquity to visit, and no heroic land scapes, let alone any spectacular sites of pilgrimage which might put up some sort of cultural protective screen between you and the Jew.\" Reading AH Sherman's Mandate Days, a collection of letters and diaries of British officials, one is struck by how their sympathies naturally seemed to lie with the Arab population, whose traditional virtues of courtesy, hospitality, good manners, a ritualised code of behaviour where much was left unsaid, and a conspicuous absence of women, chimed not only with public-school life but also with a prevailing admiration for the writings of TE Lawrence. By contrast, the Jews were perceived as noisy, ill-mannered, over-talkative and bolshie in both senses of the word. The common complaint about present-day Israeli rudeness in contrast to the more likeable attributes of the Palestinians has some roots in the perseverance of this predilection. Tel Aviv was the stronghold of the new Jew, who saw no reason to practise subservience to Christians when they didn't have to. The new Jew prided himself or herself on speaking bluntly and to the point. Either they were experimenting with ideas that were never to catch on in England - dispensing with history, for example - or they were waging a covert war against the British. Neither was an attractive proposition to the Mandate civil servants and policemen, for whom a posting to Palestine had been viewed from home as an opportunity to walk in the footsteps of the Messiah. Tel Aviv was the headquarters of the terrorists who were trying to drive the British out. When the second world war started, the city became the recreation centre for a variety of armies stationed in the Middle East. Officers' clubs mushroomed along the waterfront. When the war ended, and the campaign against British rule resumed, whole sections of Tel Aviv were deemed no-go areas for British troops. Bombs went off all over the place at unexpected hours. Kidnappings and curfews were commonplace. I talked to Yasaf Nachmayas, a veteran of the Irgun, the Zionist terrorist organisation, who spoke reverently of Menachim Begin - the Irgun's leader and later one of Israel's most intransigent of right-wing prime ministers - as \"my captain\". Nachmayas came from a family that had been in Palestine for six generations, arriving there from Sarajevo at the end of the 18th century, he thought. He regarded the Arab population as the enemy, pure and simple. The two were fighting over the same bit of land, what could you do? He had no ill-feelings towards the Arabs, no agenda to \"improve\" them. I asked him what he made of the country he had fought for. His faced turned sad, very suddenly. \"I didn't think there would be the intolerance,\" he replied. In the aftermath of the bombing of the King David Hotel, in Jerusalem in 1946, the perpetrators fled to Tel Aviv. The history of the war against the British for the state is contained in the city's small museums, which document the exploits of each faction: Haganah, Irgun, Lehi. Even before the British pulled out, there was a tacit acceptance that they had lost the war in Tel Aviv. The police force was overwhelmingly Jewish and the terrorists had infiltrated it with a network of informers. Nachmayas' value to the Irgun was that he spoke fluent, accentless English and was used to impersonate British soldiers when the Irgun needed to get access to the enemies' arms storehouses. The Irgun radio transmitter was in his parents' apartment, somewhere in the White City. In May 1948, when he was ready to declare the new state of Israel, after receiving the go-ahead from the United Nations, Ben Gurion looked for a building in which to make the announcement. He chose the art museum on Rothschild Boulevard, the first house to have been built in Tel Aviv, then owned by the city's first mayor, Meier Dizengoff, who in the 20s would ride out every morning on a white horse to inspect his domain. It is said that the museum's director was ordered to take down the paintings of nude women from the walls so as not to offend the rabbis and other puritanical members of the Zionist executive. The building is now a museum of the beginning of the Israeli state. If you ask the grumpy curator, he will let you watch an English-language film about the history of the city. You see footage of the news of the birth of Israel being received by a crowd in Times Square. Watching it, I thought of my parents in Liverpool, seated by their wireless in their honeymoon flat, hearing the same news. I thought of a Polish couple I had met in a caf\u00e9 in Haifa, holding hands in the sunshine. They heard it in a Displaced Persons camp in Italy to which they had been moved from the work camp in Russia where they had met. I had wanted to try to get inside the minds of those who lacked the benefit of hindsight; who thought that the recent past was a nightmare they could turn their backs on. I came to see that they never, in a million years, thought of themselves as thieves, as people who had stolen another people's country. In his book 1949: The First Israelis, the Israeli journalist Tom Segev writes of the extraordinary reunions that would take place in those early days - mothers bumping into sons they had not seen for 14 years, sisters reunited by newspaper advertisements. The heartrending radio programme, Who Recognises, Who Knows, sent out plaintive messages into the ether in case they might find a relative, not gassed or shot, but miraculously residing in a boxy white building on Frishman Street. These were the days before the Holocaust industry. The past was a total nightmare, the present a grim struggle as the new state tried to feed and house and find work for the swollen population. The future was the only tense in which they could place their faith. But Tel Aviv never became a new Berlin. Even in the 30s, another group of immigrants was arriving from Yemen: Jews who had never left the biblical lands. After 1948, and the beginning of the long wars with the Arab world, an influx of immigrants from North Africa, Iran, Iraq and Turkey introduced the Yekkes to Jews who were even further removed than the Oestjuden from their conception of what was European. These Sephardim saw themselves treated with disdain by the Ashkenazi, the European Jews who dominated left-of-centre political parties. Tel Aviv's Sephardi neighbourhoods are today strongholds of the Likud and Shas, the ultra-Orthodox religious party. But none of this could account for the physical decline of the White City. One day, on my third visit in seven months, the manager of the bookshop in the Tel Aviv Museum of Art called me back when I had found out that the catalogue of the Bauhaus exhibition was no longer in print. \"Wait,\" she called out. \"You have no initiative.\" Why, she asked me, didn't I call the author of the book, Dr Michael Levin, a professor at the Bezalel art school in Jerusalem. When I rang him, he invited me to his house. He had been born in Jerusalem in 1943. We spoke for hours about Tel Aviv, and gradually its history was revealed to me. He told me that, when he was a child, he asked his father why it was that in Tel Aviv they sat out in cafes in the evening (Tel Aviv today remains a city where a cafe is to be found on every street corner). The answer was in the nature of the architecture. A decree by the mayor of Jerusalem in the 20s had forced every new building to be constructed of Jerusalem stone, ideal for the climate, for it absorbed heat slowly. In Tel Aviv, they built with concrete. The sun oozed through the walls and by the evening the brand new apartments, those supposed machines for modern living, were like hothouses, driving people out of doors. And where to go, asked the Yekkes, if not to cafes that they nostalgically remembered from Berlin? This was one way in which the faulty architecture had influenced the lifestyle of the new city, but idealism was also to be the source of its destruction. When the Yekkes arrived in Tel Aviv, some had managed to evade the Nazi stripping of their financial assets. Facing unemployment, they had a sum of money, which they invested by commissioning the construction of an apartment building. They would reside in one flat and live on the rents from the others. But at the end of the war, the municipal council passed rent-control acts and suddenly the owners found that they could barely live off their receipts, let alone maintain the buildings that were already corroding in the salt air from the sea. Almost nothing was understood about long-term maintenance, Dr Levin told me. So the long decline began, barely a decade after the White City rose from the sand. Tel Aviv today is a divided city. Ha Yarkon Street, where once Arthur Koestler was kept awake by noisy gramophones from the officers' clubs along the shore, is no longer open to the sea. A row of five-star hotels, constructed in the 60s and 70s, acts as a barrier, blocking the breeze. Pink condominiums overshadow what remains of the White City. The focus is on the marina and the esplanade, where you can watch the early-morning joggers take their exercise. Many of them work in the skyscrapers of the stock exchange, built over the Arab neighbourhood of Manshieh that was destroyed in the 1948 war. By the bus station, there is a shanty-town of shacks, a little city of illegal immigrants from the Third World to whom Tel Aviv is also a dream: not of the first Jewish city for 2,000 years, but of an opportunity, like any other, for a new life in a prosperous country. Just as I was finishing my novel, something new appeared on the Amazon search engine when once again I typed in the words Tel Aviv. It was a book called Tel Aviv: From Dream To Reality, by a man called Joachim Schlor, and published by Reaktion Books. Schlor is a German non-Jew and he, too, had fallen in love with Tel Aviv. \"No feature of special interest arrests the eye,\" the book begins. \"Yet the streets themselves are beautiful, and it is only by wandering through them again and again, curious, observant and aiming for nowhere in particular, that one can truly get to know Tel Aviv.\" And on the next page I read: \"I wish that more of the many people in Western Europe who engage in debate about Israel and the Middle Eastern conflict would make contact with this contemporary city, would question it and listen to it.\" Schlor's book, not mine, is the history Tel Aviv has been waiting for. Yet we begin from the same starting point, that in that city which still has inhabitants who are older than itself, lie the paradoxes of many things: of Modernism, of Jewish identity, of political idealism, as well as of the Israeli state. To be a new Jew was to be a paradox: the people who instead of a land had had a story, a narrative of their existence, had decided that it was only the future that counted. They were fatally wrong. One of the tragedies of Israel is not just what was done to the Palestinians, but what the Jews did to themselves: they wanted to rid themselves of the memories of the diaspora. \"They crave,\" wrote one observer quoted by Schlor, \"to get away from their past and to put out of their mind all the marks of indignity, all the stigmata of shame, all the yellow patches that Jew-hatred has ever devised. They even crave to put out of their mind part of their own mind.\" Still Tel Aviv enchants me. The present urban mess that is the city speaks for the country. Like Israel, it turned out, in Tom Segev's words, \"less enlightened, less idealistic, less altruistic and less Ashkenazi than the [founders] had hoped... the future would promise neither justice for all, nor equality for all, nor peace. Perhaps the first Israelis never recognised this. Absorbed in euphoria, they failed to see the reality as it was... but the road they took was the road they believed to be right, and they followed it with wholehearted confidence and belief in their cause. For that, they are to be envied.\" All dreams are chaotic, seldom peaceful and have a tendency sometimes to turn into nightmares. But if you walk Tel Aviv's streets and listen to its people, you catch a glimpse of what the ghosts thought they were building",

I went back to calendula, the pot marigold, last year and did not regret it. Although it is a hardy annual, we sowed seeds in March under glass and brought the plants on quickly in individual pots so that they were ready to follow spring bedding by mid-May.</p> <p>I like bright-orange, fully double marigolds, myself, and the Extra Selected strain of 'Radio' served us well. That combines and contrasts nicely with love-in-a-mist. Instead of using the familiar blue 'Miss Jekyll' strain of Nigella damascena , we went for the purplish N. hispanica , which has striking flowers over quite a long June period. We raised this the same way as the calendula.</p> <p>This kind of bedding gives you a few weeks but then needs a follow-on. One suggestion I would make is the bedding collarette dahlia 'Dandy', which is single but with an inner circle of half petals, often in a different colour. This is an intriguing arrangement. If you sowed the dahlia under cold glass in the first week of May and grew the seedlings on in one-litre pots, by the first week in July they'd have made nice bushy plants that are almost ready to flower. A late sowing of a cold-sensitive subject such as this gets over the danger of it being set back by cold nights in its early stages of development. Naturally, you'll want them to be well hardened off by planting-out time.</p> <p>An annual that responds well to a late-ish sowing is the spider flower, Cleome pungens . When bruised, the plant has a strong, mustard-oil smell and, be warned, is attractive to the caterpillars of the cabbage white butterfly. But, if well-grown, single plants have almost the habit of a sturdy shrub, with a central leader to 1.5m. The palmate leaves are handsome and the dense flower heads continue to perform without need of dead-heading for three months. They do tend to wilt somewhat in strong sunshine, so a half-shaded position is ideal. There are separate colour strains available in white, pink or rosy purple, or a mixture of the three, which are all compatible colours. But I often want to combine the white one with orange tithonias. A mixture that included pink would not be suitable.</p> <p>The one thing this annual insists on is to be grown well and without a check. A late-April sowing will be early enough. Get the seedlings into individual pots and, if they need to be kept waiting, pot them on so that they never starve. Each plant should have the support of a single, strong cane with a single tie to its main stem.</p> <p>An annual planting that I have made twice now, and mean to repeat again this year, is a pretty even mixture, 0.3m tall, of Helenium amarum and Gaillardia 'Red Plume'. You rarely see the helenium, which has very bright green, linear foliage (each plant is the better for a little brushwood support) and a long succession of small, yellow, typical helenium daisies. The gaillardia, basically another daisy, is fully double and a rich shade of deep, brownish red. August to October is their season.</p> <p>The everlasting Helichrysum 'Dargan Hill Monarch' is a small shrub (0.5m) that can be grown from seed or cuttings. There is a long succession of its papery yellow daisies held above rather greyish-green foliage. It has a season lasting till the first frosts.</p> <p>There are three annual climbers that make wonderful fillers to clamber over other plants. The black-eyed Susan, Thunbergia alata , comes in three separate colours or a mixture of the three. Always, unless you have a prejudice against the colour, go for the orange strain, which is its natural colour and the most effective. The flower is rounded, spreading out from a tube, and has a black centre. Mina lobata has short chains of tubular flowers whose colouring changes as the flowers age, from white, through yellow to orange. It is an unusual-looking climber. I have seen it making a column up peasticks, but I like it over Cotoneaster horizontalis , or over a rose or the dying stems of alstroemerias or delphiniums. It has many uses.</p> <p>And Rhodochiton atrosanguineus makes long trails of dangling purple blossom with a seemingly unending season. The persistent calyx is like a lampshade. You get the longest flowering season from this if you sow it in September, pot the seedlings individually and over-winter them under just-frost-free glass, planting out in May. You will still get decent results by sowing now.</p> <p>Another annual, or short-lived perennial, whose seeds it might be best to keep by for an August sowing so as to get strong, bushy plants to bed out spring 2001, is the sweet scabious, Scabiosa atropurpurea (1m). I like this in its deep maroon 'Ace Of Spades' strain, in which the pin-cushion of white stamens shows up in delightful contrast - a good cut flower for late summer</p> <p>\u0095 Christopher Lloyd's Gardening Year is published by Frances Lincoln at \u00a325.

When bruised, the plant has a strong, mustard-oil smell and, be warned, is attractive to the caterpillars of the cabbage white butterfly. But, if well-grown, single plants have almost the habit of a sturdy shrub, with a central leader to 1.5m. The palmate leaves are handsome and the dense flower heads continue to perform without need of dead-heading for three months. They do tend to wilt somewhat in strong sunshine, so a half-shaded position is ideal. There are separate colour strains available in white, pink or rosy purple, or a mixture of the three, which are all compatible colours. But I often want to combine the white one with orange tithonias. A mixture that included pink would not be suitable. The one thing this annual insists on is to be grown well and without a check. A late-April sowing will be early enough. Get the seedlings into individual pots and, if they need to be kept waiting, pot them on so that they never starve. Each plant should have the support of a single, strong cane with a single tie to its main stem. An annual planting that I have made twice now, and mean to repeat again this year, is a pretty even mixture, 0.3m tall, of Helenium amarum and Gaillardia 'Red Plume'. You rarely see the helenium, which has very bright green, linear foliage (each plant is the better for a little brushwood support) and a long succession of small, yellow, typical helenium daisies. The gaillardia, basically another daisy, is fully double and a rich shade of deep, brownish red. August to October is their season. The everlasting Helichrysum 'Dargan Hill Monarch' is a small shrub (0.5m) that can be grown from seed or cuttings. There is a long succession of its papery yellow daisies held above rather greyish-green foliage. It has a season lasting till the first frosts. There are three annual climbers that make wonderful fillers to clamber over other plants. The black-eyed Susan, Thunbergia alata , comes in three separate colours or a mixture of the three. Always, unless you have a prejudice against the colour, go for the orange strain, which is its natural colour and the most effective. The flower is rounded, spreading out from a tube, and has a black centre. Mina lobata has short chains of tubular flowers whose colouring changes as the flowers age, from white, through yellow to orange. It is an unusual-looking climber. I have seen it making a column up peasticks, but I like it over Cotoneaster horizontalis , or over a rose or the dying stems of alstroemerias or delphiniums. It has many uses. And Rhodochiton atrosanguineus makes long trails of dangling purple blossom with a seemingly unending season. The persistent calyx is like a lampshade. You get the longest flowering season from this if you sow it in September, pot the seedlings individually and over-winter them under just-frost-free glass, planting out in May. You will still get decent results by sowing now. Another annual, or short-lived perennial, whose seeds it might be best to keep by for an August sowing so as to get strong, bushy plants to bed out spring 2001, is the sweet scabious, Scabiosa atropurpurea (1m). I like this in its deep maroon 'Ace Of Spades' strain, in which the pin-cushion of white stamens shows up in delightful contrast - a good cut flower for late summer \u0095 Christopher Lloyd's Gardening Year is published by Frances Lincoln at \u00a325.

      "body": "<p>The tian of Provence - a dish of vegetables cooked in a shallow earthenware terrine - belongs to that venerable band of one-pot meals that takes its name from the vessel in which it cooks. Three things distinguish the tian from all other cooking pots: first, it must be rounded and of a diameter that reflects the requirements of the household; next, it should be glazed within, and unglazed without; finally, the edge of the dish must be no higher than will accommodate the ingredients in a single layer.</p> <p>As befits a peasant dish, the ingredients for a tian are as variable as you please, being dependent on what could be grown or gathered close to home. The traditional favourite is chard - \"blettes\" in French, \"blea\" in the Proven\u00e7al - which thrives where lesser spinaches must wilt; it is a vegetable so popular in the canton of Nice that the inhabitants were known in less delicate times as \"caga-blea\" (shit-chard). In their proper season, aubergines, onions, peppers, tomatoes, courgettes, artichokes - the classic combinations of the Mediterranean kitchen - are also ideal for a tian. Olive oil provides the necessary richness, garlic and herbs the essential flavouring. For substance, a handful of rice, or a ladleful of chickpeas saved from a soup, might be added.</p> <p>For pleasure and feast days, the tian wears a topping of breadcrumbs and cheese, crisped under the grill (in the old days, it would be sent to the baker to cook in the residual heat of his ovens). For strength, eggs are stirred in to set with the juices; or a bit of meat or poultry from the Sunday pot-au-feu; or a layer of Cantal or Gruy\u00e8re cheese, to melt in the middle. By the sea, tians are served with a side dish of fresh sardines or anchovies; in the hills, with \"mountain-fish\" - salt cod. The whole is served without fuss or flourish in its own dish, as a first course or the main event, depending on its composition.</p> <p>Such dishes, simple and adaptable, are not so much recipes as reactions, obeying the rules of necessity rather than conscious choice. Ideally, all ingredients should undergo all cooking processes in the same dish - and no cheating. Well, maybe a little; in fact, as much as you please. The preliminary frying can easily be completed in an iron pan rather than by placing the earthenware directly on the heat. But if authenticity is your goal, temper the tian before you set it on the flame. I've tempered many a tian in my time, and cracked as many more. There are ways of tempering that involve oil and salt and garlic, but the simplest is to fill the dish with cold water right to the brim and heat it until the water evaporates completely. And don't blame me if it doesn't work; blame the potter. The most reliable tians are made of the good red clay of Vallauris, the little village chosen by Picasso for his ceramic workshop.</p> <p>If you're still in any doubt as to a tian's proper shape and colour, you'll find its likeness in the National Gallery of Scotland, in a detail of Velazquez's haunting portrait, Old Woman Cooking Eggs. The venerable lady's frying implement, though undoubtedly made by a Spanish potter, is the perfect model of the Proven\u00e7al tian. The people of Catalunya and their neighbours in Provence share far more than culinary habit. Both speak a version of the langue-d'oc dialect - as opposed to the langue-d'ail (or d'oui), the basis for modern French - a language considered subversive on both sides of the border. In Spain, during the Franco years, the Catalan language was officially banned from all public utterance; in Provence, for reasons of religion as well as of politics, both language and literature were ruthlessly suppressed for five centuries.</p> <p>It was not until well into the 19th century that Frederic Mistral, poet of Provence at a time when romanticism cast its rosy glow, set himself the task of reclaiming his people's past. That he considered the tian - both container and contents - worthy of a full description is an indication of the place it held in the people's hearts. Mistral, the inspiration for many a modern separatist movement, had a fine nose for the things that matter. And to a people forbidden to express themselves in any way except domestic habit, the tian mattered. All the great dishes are political statements: they speak to the people of who they are.</p> <p>The tian may be a newcomer to modern menus, but that's only because it took so long to come out of the closet. Now that it's out, feel free to play. Rules are made to be broken, and this is a dish, after all, with the whiff of subversion about its little earthenware ears. Oh, I nearly forgot: serve your tian neither cold nor hot, but barely warm - the temperature of a summer's day in Provence, in the shade of an olive grove, beside a field of lavender, in the shadow of a vine-covered terrace. Ah well. It's the thought that counts.</p> <p>All recipes serve six.</p> <p><b> Tian of spinach and raisins </b></p> <p>800g spinach, picked and washed <br> 2 medium onions, peeled and finely chopped <br> 50g unsalted butter <br> 30g raisins <br> 1/5 whole nutmeg, finely grated<br> <br>1/4 tsp ground allspice<br> Salt and pepper <br> 1 sprig thyme <br> 1 handful picked flat-leaf parsley <br> 1 tsp picked chervil (if available) <br> 200ml double cream <br> 2 very fresh egg yolks <br> 2 tbsp olive oil <br> 30g pinenuts, roasted golden brown</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 160C/325F/ gas mark 3. Put a pan of water on to boil. Plunge the spinach into the boiling water and cook for just a minute or so. Drain the spinach, cool it under ice or running water, then squeeze the leaves as dry as you can. Fry the onions in the butter until soft and golden, add the raisins, nut meg, allspice, salt and pepper. Finely chop the spinach and herbs, and mix into the onion mix, then pour in the cream, egg yolks and pinenuts. Stir well.</p> <p>Warm an oven-proof dish, put in a tablespoon or two of olive oil, and pour in the spinach mix. Cook the tian in the oven for 20 minutes or so until the mixture has only barely set. This eats best when only just warm.</p> <p><b> Tian of courgettes and tomatoes </b><br> A handsome dish is best for this tian, as after the initial preparation and the final assembling, the whole caboodle is cooked in the oven and then taken to table. It would be criminal to cook such a beauty and then break it up on to separate plates.</p> <p>2 medium onions <br> 2 red peppers <br> 90ml olive oil <br> Salt and pepper <br> 1 clove garlic, finely chopped <br> 1kg very ripe tomatoes <br> 1kg slender courgettes <br> 1 small sprig thyme <br> 25g finest Parmesan, grated</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/ gas mark 5. First off, peel, halve and thinly slice the onions, and do likewise with the peppers. Heat a large frying pan, pour in the olive oil, and toss in the onion and pepper along with some salt and pepper. Fry gently until the vegetables have softened and are just lightly coloured, then add the garlic, stir everything together, and spread the mixture out over the base of an earthenware dish.</p> <p>Remove the eye from the tomatoes and thinly slice the flesh. Top and tail the courgettes, and cut into thin diagonal slices. Lay alternate rows of tomato and courgette on top of the onion-and-pepper base. Season with milled pepper and sea salt, drop in the thyme, and spoon over a little more oil. Place the tian in the oven, and bake for 30-40 minutes, until it has darkened at the edges and the courgettes are quite soft.</p> <p>Strew the Parmesan over the top of the dish, and bake for five minutes longer. This tian is at its best served just warm an hour or so after cooking, either just as it is or with little pieces of griddled lamb, chicken or fish.</p> <p><b> Tian of leeks, potatoes and ceps</b><br> Good to eat on its own, and as an accompaniment for simply roasted or poached fish and meat.</p> <p>1kg leeks <br> 10g very good dried ceps <br> 1.5kg waxy potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced <br> 2 medium onions, peeled and finely chopped <br> 100g unsalted fine butter <br> 1 small sprig thyme <br> 1 clove garlic, finely chopped <br> Salt and pepper <br> Asiago or Emmenthal cheese, grated (optional)</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/ gas mark 5. Trim the excess dark green from the leeks and remove the root. Cut the leeks into 1.5cm lengths and submerge them in cold water. Wash the leeks a few times to remove all the grit, then drain. Place the dried ceps in a bowl and cover with luke-warm water for around 20 minutes. Rinse the potato slices in a colander under the cold tap until the water runs clear. Drain the ceps through a fine sieve, retaining their soaking liquid, and squeeze them dry.</p> <p>Liberally grease a gratin dish with half the butter, then scatter in the onion and ceps, and scatter over the garlic and thyme. Place a layer of potatoes on top, then follow with the leeks. Season liberally, then top with the remaining potatoes (I prefer the dish to look random in design, and not horridly patterned, such as the fish-scale effect.) Dot the gratin with the rest of the butter, then pour in the cep liquor and enough water to come just below the top layer, and bake for 45 minutes. Turn down the heat to 135C/275F/gas mark 1, and cook for 15 minutes more. Spread the grated cheese on top, bake for a further five minutes, then turn off the oven and leave the tian to sit awhile. (I have as deep a suspicion of piping-hot food as I do of food served straight from the fridge.)</p> <p><b> Tian of onions</b><br> Long, slow cooking helps the onions collapse into the enormous quantity of liquid they render. When the liquid has all but evaporated, the onions will be soft and slightly sweetened.</p> <p>2.5kg medium-sized onions <br> 2 bayleaves <br> 25g caster sugar <br> Sea salt and fresh black pepper <br> 1 small sprig thyme, tied <br> 150ml white wine <br> 60g unsalted butter</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/gas mark 2 (or even the next grade up, depending on the reliability of your oven). Peel the onions, leaving the root intact, cut each through the root into six pieces and lay, in a random fashion, in the tian. Pop in the bayleaves, and sprinkle the sugar, salt and pepper over the top. Add the thyme, pour in the wine and add 75ml water. Cut the butter into thin slices, and lay on top.</p> <p>Bake the tian for 45 minutes or so, then turn the onions, taking care not to break them up too much, and cook for a further half an hour. Turn carefully again. As the liquid content varies so much in onions, cook for a further hour, or even an hour and a half, until the onions are coloured and collapsed, and there is very little liquid residue</p> <p>\u0095 Elisabeth Luard is a food writer.

Tian of leeks, potatoes and ceps Good to eat on its own, and as an accompaniment for simply roasted or poached fish and meat. 1kg leeks 10g very good dried ceps 1.5kg waxy potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced 2 medium onions, peeled and finely chopped 100g unsalted fine butter 1 small sprig thyme 1 clove garlic, finely chopped Salt and pepper Asiago or Emmenthal cheese, grated (optional) Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/ gas mark 5. Trim the excess dark green from the leeks and remove the root. Cut the leeks into 1.5cm lengths and submerge them in cold water. Wash the leeks a few times to remove all the grit, then drain. Place the dried ceps in a bowl and cover with luke-warm water for around 20 minutes. Rinse the potato slices in a colander under the cold tap until the water runs clear. Drain the ceps through a fine sieve, retaining their soaking liquid, and squeeze them dry. Liberally grease a gratin dish with half the butter, then scatter in the onion and ceps, and scatter over the garlic and thyme. Place a layer of potatoes on top, then follow with the leeks. Season liberally, then top with the remaining potatoes (I prefer the dish to look random in design, and not horridly patterned, such as the fish-scale effect.) Dot the gratin with the rest of the butter, then pour in the cep liquor and enough water to come just below the top layer, and bake for 45 minutes. Turn down the heat to 135C/275F/gas mark 1, and cook for 15 minutes more. Spread the grated cheese on top, bake for a further five minutes, then turn off the oven and leave the tian to sit awhile. (I have as deep a suspicion of piping-hot food as I do of food served straight from the fridge.) Tian of onions Long, slow cooking helps the onions collapse into the enormous quantity of liquid they render. When the liquid has all but evaporated, the onions will be soft and slightly sweetened. 2.5kg medium-sized onions 2 bayleaves 25g caster sugar Sea salt and fresh black pepper 1 small sprig thyme, tied 150ml white wine 60g unsalted butter Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/gas mark 2 (or even the next grade up, depending on the reliability of your oven). Peel the onions, leaving the root intact, cut each through the root into six pieces and lay, in a random fashion, in the tian. Pop in the bayleaves, and sprinkle the sugar, salt and pepper over the top. Add the thyme, pour in the wine and add 75ml water. Cut the butter into thin slices, and lay on top. Bake the tian for 45 minutes or so, then turn the onions, taking care not to break them up too much, and cook for a further half an hour. Turn carefully again. As the liquid content varies so much in onions, cook for a further hour, or even an hour and a half, until the onions are coloured and collapsed, and there is very little liquid residue \u0095 Elisabeth Luard is a food writer.

It was a day, I decided, for a caipirinha, the classic cocktail of Brazil, made of cachaca (aka Brazilian white lightning), lime, ice and sugar. It may have been a bit purist for the glitz of Asia di Cuba, but it suited my mood: funky, hunky and kinda chunky. Very chunky.</p> <p>Did Asia di Cuba or St Martin's Lane, the hotel in which it is housed, register on your social seismograph when they opened last year? There was, if you remember, a bit of fuss in the more outr\u00e9 columns of our more outr\u00e9 newspapers and magazines. Most of the comment focused on the high- fashion alliance of Ian Shrager, the US's most avant-garde hotelier, and Philippe Starck, France's most acceptable avant-garde design export, and some of the wackier consequences thereof, particularly in the dining line.</p> <p>In truth, the St Martin's Lane hotel is a bit Alice in Wonderlandish. Messrs Shrager and Starck have taken a very dull, neo-brutalist, one-time office block and turned it into a playground of the senses, with the emphasis on the playground. Simple-minded cove that I am, I was confused as to whether the objects in the reception area, for example, were contemporary works of art or tables and chairs, until I saw Aubretia, an unquestionable work of art herself, perched on one.</p> <p>There is a brasserie, of which I had heard mixed views, and there is a dining room, where we were to lunch, which is really rather splendid: a heady mix of high-kitsch, low-kitsch and the preposterously kitsch - and that goes for the staff as well as the decor. There are fat pillars, some covered in books on shelves, interspersed with 40s and 50s radios and TVs. There is one pillar covered with dusky pink velveteen, dimpled with buttons, and another bedecked with vases full of what looked, at a distance, very much like plastic azaleas. Over each table hangs a naked lightbulb at the end of a long loop of flex - and not any old bulb or any old flex, come to that.</p> <p>It's a kind of anti-design design, all very good-humoured and kinda fun. And it works, because it's all stitched together with a strong basic structure. In fact, you can see how, when we all grow tired of this version of the Starck vision (by about the end of next week), it will be a morning's work to strip away the frou-frou and replace it with something else.</p> <p>The staff had the good humour and the kitsch well buttoned-up, but they lacked the strong underlying structure. Some of them lacked a command of basic English, too. They were willing enough, but willingness alone does not divert irritation from the failure to deliver a glass of wine when it was needed, ignorance about the contents of a particular dish, languid ease between courses and the failure to deliver our dishes at more or less the same time. As the dining room was not exactly full to overflowing, and there were only two of us, this did seem inexplicable and inexcusable.</p> <p>But the food itself, when it arrived and for all its fired-up fusionism, was a great deal better than I had feared it would be. The idea that there is a real symbiosis between the foods of Asia and Cuba owes more to restaurateurs who are randy for novelty than to any natural relationship, but individual dishes were as beguiling as the decor, and for much the same reasons. The ceviche of mussels and clams \"Mixto\" - or, as the menu subscript put it, \"poached Chilean mussels, cockles, Manila clams, rock shrimp, tomato and citrus juices\" - was like seafood in a particularly piquant Bloody Mary, though without the vodka. The tomato and citrus juice elements were charmingly fresh and spiced without being punitive and, more importantly, drowning the flavours of the shellfish.</p> <p>The calamari salad \"Asia di Cuba\", with hearts of palm, banana, coconut, cashew nuts, rocket and endive fris\u00e9e with sesame orange dressing, was one of the best salads I have tasted in a decade (tasted only - it was Aubretia's to eat), even if the squid had a decorative rather than a starring role. It was crushingly fresh, clean-flavoured and well-balanced.</p> <p>When Aubretia followed this up with marinated brochette of salmon and saltcod, she decided that she was on to another winner. The cod was of the lightly-salted-in-this-kitchen variety, rather than the rank, leathery stuff so beloved of the Italians and the Proven\u00e7al French. Chunks of it were strung together with the salmon along a piece of lemongrass, and the whole was ample and beautifully cooked. Sadly, a mountainous haystack of noodles and a sea of overpowering, lacquer-like sauce stuff rather spoiled the initial impressions.</p> <p>I couldn't make up my mind about my palomillo of lamb, which was a bit like a kebab that had been beaten to the thickness of a hardback book cover and the size of a sheet of A4. It was spread with mojito, which I take to be a garlic-and-herb mix, and there were also, in no particular order, fried peppers, aubergine, onions, watercress and a \"herbed rice cracker\", about which I can remember nothing whatsoever. One of our many waiters suggested rather cheekily that the dish was sufficiently large to share with Aubretia, but I put him right on that point. It was interesting rather than overwhelming.</p> <p>The bill, on the other hand, was overwhelming as well as interesting. In fact, it was fascinating. It's a long time since food so comprehensively outscored drink on one of my bills. The grand total was \u00a376.50, \u00a314 of which went on my cocktail, a bottle of water and two espressos. The rest was eatables, with the salmon and saltcod dish setting the pace at \u00a319.50 and a rather solid Vietnamese banana bread pudding adding its \u00a39.50-worth to the total, it's not hard to see why.</p> <p>I think the bill and the service rather take the fun edge off Asia di Cuba.

Glenn has a similar complex about his abnormally thin legs. Will you please allow Glenn to wear tracksuit trousers on his next cross-country run, or change the route and stick to unpopulated fields and lanes in future, thus avoiding the taunts of ignorant fox-killing, songbird-culling, hedge-removing, river-polluting country dwellers.

She produced a bottle of Safeway's Cava, then got down on one huge knee and asked me to marry her. I turned her down. Glenn was disappointed. He said, \"I would 'ave bin the only one in our class to 'ave a mam and dad livin' together.\"</p> <p><strong>Wednesday, March 1 </strong></p> <p> A terse reply from Lunt: \"Dear Mr Mole, The wearing of tracksuit trousers is prohibited during cross-country runs.

'E's got 'alf my genes.\" I said, \"Yes, the grammar, punctuation and spelling genes, unfortunately.\" As I was leaving, she said, \"I still love you to bits, Aidy.\" I pretended not to hear her I wrote Mr Lunt the following reply: \"Dear Mr Lunt, My own adolescence was made a torment by taunts about my acned complexion. Glenn has a similar complex about his abnormally thin legs. Will you please allow Glenn to wear tracksuit trousers on his next cross-country run, or change the route and stick to unpopulated fields and lanes in future, thus avoiding the taunts of ignorant fox-killing, songbird-culling, hedge-removing, river-polluting country dwellers. I remain Sir, AA Mole.\" Tuesday, February 29 Leap Day. A letter from the Rt Hon Neil Kinnock! Whom I met once when I was the offal chef in Hoi Polloi, the Soho restaurant before it was reopened as the Oxygen Bar, H2O. The letter said: \"Dear Mr Mole, I have great pleasure in enclosing your invitation to the Labour Party Centenary Dinner on Monday, April 10, 2000. I will be hosting the evening, and I am delighted that once again the Prime Minister will be our guest of honour. \"As you may expect there will be very strict security. I regret therefore that I am unable to give you the exact location at this stage except to say that it will be at a central London hotel...\" I obviously made a lasting impression on Mr Kinnock. He must have truly enjoyed his sheep's testicle in blackcurrant coulis. 8.30pm Sharon Bott has just left this house in tears. She arrived uninvited at 7.30 in a taxi. She produced a bottle of Safeway's Cava, then got down on one huge knee and asked me to marry her. I turned her down. Glenn was disappointed. He said, \"I would 'ave bin the only one in our class to 'ave a mam and dad livin' together.\" Wednesday, March 1 A terse reply from Lunt: \"Dear Mr Mole, The wearing of tracksuit trousers is prohibited during cross-country runs. Best wishes, Mr Lunt. PS As a country dweller, I find your remarks about country folk extremely offensive.\" Friday, March 3 My mother has just pointed to the small print at the bottom of my Centenary Dinner invitation. The tickets cost \u00a3600. I have made an optician's appointment.",

Safeway's Australian Shiraz 1998 (15 points, out of 20, \u00a34.49) offers the confidence of its provenance loud and clear, and indeed justifies it with warm fruit that is juicy yet attitudinal and fully-charged. It's a terrific quaffing wine. I do not think a bottle labelled Safeway's French Syrah would seem half, nay a quarter, so exciting. On the other hand (and, at \u00a36.99, on a different level of expectation), Mamre Brook Chardonnay 1998 (Safeway, 16 points) says it's from the Barossa Valley, so we might assume this to imply more complexity and indi viduality. So it proves: the wine flows softly and ripely, offering a lithe richness, civilised fruitiness and an elegant finish. Safeway's Riddoch Cabernet Shiraz 1997 (16 points, \u00a37.99) is from the Coonawarra, and this 'bio-clime', dubbed the Aussie equivalent of the French terroir, is in subtle evidence in the fruit, which carries delightful hints of spice, mint, blueberries and blackcurrants.

It's a hugely soft yet dry-sided wine of consummate quaffability. Over at Tesco, there is Penfold's Koonunga Hill Shiraz/Cabernet Sauvignon 1997 (16 points, \u00a36.99), and most elegant it is, too, with a lively varnish to the soft fruit that is not normally as high-gloss as this. The wine purrs across the tastebuds on padded feet. Tesco's McLaren Vale Shiraz 1997 (16 points, \u00a36.99) is proud to point to its particular bio-climatic origins, and its fruit is an exemplary example, for the money, of the substance, staying power and potency of shirazes from that region.</p> <p>At Thresher and Victoria Wine, there is Tatachilla Grenache Shiraz 1998 (16 points, \u00a35.99), from a McLaren Vale estate that has progressed hugely since its latest change of ownership in 1995. A decade ago, I saw grapes destined for Tatachilla swollen with irrigated water, but this can hardly have been true of the beauties that went into this bargain blend. The wine has style, bravura and loads of fruit, but is never silly or too juicy, the tannins being temperate and tasty. Samuels Bay Grenache 1997 (16 points, \u00a36.49) is one of the most concentrated examples of this grape I've tasted. Plummy, cigar-edged, perfumed, rich, very free-flowing yet delicate, it has considerable charm. It is made by Adam Wynn in South Australia, and is, one presumes, a blend of several vineyards' fruit.</p> <p>And last, at Unwins and Fuller's (and possibly Majestic), there is Ironstone Shiraz/Grenache 1997. This combines several themes, uniting an impressive Rhne-style dryness with an Italian sense of food-friendliness, underneath which is a uniquely Western Australian posture to the fruit that is never blowsy or pretentious. The grapes, gathered from unirrigated vineyards several hundred kilometres apart, are grown in iron-oxide gravel, hence the name and the taste of the wine. It rates 16.5 points and costs \u00a36.99.</p> <p>\u0095 Superplonk 2000 and Streetplonk 2000 are published by Hodder at \u00a35.99 each.

Look at these women closely, and you'll notice they've generally got one foot on the bottom.",

Last year's ruling, which applied only to pupils aged at least 26, was seen as a breakthrough for cash-strapped pupils, 43% of whom are either unfunded or paid less than \u00a36,000 a year. But yesterday the lord chief justice, Lord Bingham, said pupils were not \"working under contracts of apprenticeship\" under the national minimum wage act and were therefore not entitled to be paid the statutory \u00a33.70 an hour. Pupils, many of whom have run up large debts at bar school, have to serve two pupillages of six months each before they can practise independently as barristers.

Some chambers provide funded pupillages, guaranteeing a certain level of income to top up the pupil's own earnings. The most prestigious commercial chambers pay as much as \u00a325,000 a year. But many pay as little as \u00a35,000 to \u00a36,000 a year, and many pupillages are unfunded, leaving the pupil to rely on parental support or bank loans. The \"friendly\" test case was brought by Rebecca Edmonds, 31, of Balham, south London, against her head of chambers, Michael Lawson QC, with his agreement and the backing of the Bar Council, to find out whether chambers were legally obliged to pay pupils over 26 a wage at or above the national minimum. Pupils under that age are excluded from the act by provisions relating to young apprentices. The Bar Council has recommended that chambers guarantee a minimum of \u00a36,000 a year, amid fears that the bar could revert to being a profession only for the well-off.

Ms Edmonds, an Oxford graduate in English, worked in information technology before transferring to law.

However, regardless of the outcome, it has told Mrs Pool she will have to leave the terraced cottage next door to Immanuel church in Southsea, Hampshire, where she has lived for 20 years.</p> <p>She also claims that the local church, which is a member of the Baptist Union, failed to pay her national insurance contributions, and she is consequently not entitled to benefits or state pension.</p> <p>Mrs Pool, who is on medication for depression, said yesterday: \"This whole thing has left me feeling awful. I've given up many things for this church, and this happens. I never wanted it to go this far, but they wouldn't back down. I used to have a lot of friends in the church but not anymore. Some have said they're praying for me, but I doubt that's going to put a roof over my head.</p> <p>Me and my husband have raised five children in this home; at our time of life we didn't expect to have to move.\"</p> <p>She and her husband, Dominic, 51, moved in in 1979.

      "bodyText": "A Baptist church caretaker claims she was sacked and threatened with eviction when she asked to be paid the minimum wage. Diane Pool, 58, is going to an employment tribunal next month claiming unfair dismissal, which the church denies. However, regardless of the outcome, it has told Mrs Pool she will have to leave the terraced cottage next door to Immanuel church in Southsea, Hampshire, where she has lived for 20 years. She also claims that the local church, which is a member of the Baptist Union, failed to pay her national insurance contributions, and she is consequently not entitled to benefits or state pension. Mrs Pool, who is on medication for depression, said yesterday: \"This whole thing has left me feeling awful. I've given up many things for this church, and this happens. I never wanted it to go this far, but they wouldn't back down. I used to have a lot of friends in the church but not anymore. Some have said they're praying for me, but I doubt that's going to put a roof over my head. Me and my husband have raised five children in this home; at our time of life we didn't expect to have to move.\" She and her husband, Dominic, 51, moved in in 1979. A practising Catholic, she had been a volunteer at the church; her fulltime job included unlocking the church for services, weddings and funerals, setting out the hall for meetings, and dealing with volunteer groups and societies that used the church. She started on \u00a318 a week, subject to an annual increase of \u00a32.

Mrs Pool said she had occasionally mentioned her salary to the church, but the introduction of the minimum wage last year galvanised her resolve - it is \u00a33.10 an hour where accommodation is provided. \"When I realised I was getting so much less I was shocked,\" she said, estimating she worked up to 40 hours a week.

Norfolk deputy chief constable Colin Port was called in to lead the allegation because of claims of police collusion in Ms Nelson's murder in a car bomb attack at her home in Lurgan, Co Armagh. His team of 65 officers, including 20 from the RUC, has so far interviewed 5,000 people.",

      "bodyText": "The first \"superhead\", brought in to turn round a failing school in Islington, north London, resigned unexpectedly yesterday from his \u00a370,000 a year job. Torsten Friedag was appointed in January last year to head the failing George Orwell school, which was reopened as the Islington Arts and Media school last autumn. The school, refurnished at a cost of \u00a38m was relaunched under the government's fresh start scheme, whereby schools with a poor record are given a change of name and staff. The education and employment secretary, David Blunkett, endorsed Mr Friedag's appointment and attended the reopening amid a fanfare of publicity. Mr Friedag was hailed as a visionary head capable of turning around a school which had become notorious for poor academic performance, truancy, violence and disruption. But yesterday Islington education authority said in a statement that he had decided that the interests of the pupils would be best served if someone with \"different skills\" took the school on to its next stage. It is understood that the poor attendance and violent behaviour among pupils that had characterised the George Orwell school were still prevalent. Islington's acting director of education, Simon Jenkins, called Mr Friedag's resignation a \"brave and mature decision\". Mr Friedag said: \"The establishment of the school has been a great enterprise. I am sad to be leaving, and I gave this a great deal of thought. I am proud of what we have achieved. \"I do believe it is the right time for somebody else to take on the challenge.\" The resignation is a blow to the fresh start policy. Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said that if the scheme were \"done properly and without the glare of publicity that generally accompanies it, it could work.\"",

The judge held that Brady had never told medical officer James Collins that it was his intention to starve himself to death.</p> <p>In reaching his decision, he had been swayed by Dr Collins, who described Brady as psychopathic, prone to narcissism, egocentricity, histrionics, obsessionality, need for control, paranoia, litigiousness, lack of remorse and lack of empathy.</p> <p>While Brady did not consent to artificial feeding via a tube inserted through his nose to his stomach, he did not offer any resistance either. According to Dr Collins, Brady had talked of receiving a massive psychological boost from previous hunger strikes which he saw as a battle of wills with the authorities.</p> <p>Dr Collins told the hearing, held in private at the high court in Liverpool last week at the request of Brady's solicitors, that after the transfer from Jade ward last September, he had \"felt the need to do something and get his own back and exercise the control and address the needs of his self confidence and narcissism\".</p> <p>The doctor had concluded that Brady's decision to refuse food was caused by the personality disorder. It was \"a very, very unusual decision by a very, very unusual person\" in circumstances which were not very unusual, though they were legitimate grounds for complaint.</p> <p>Brady's hunger strike began after a six-strong control and restraint team entered his room in full riot gear without warning on September 30, last year. The judge said: \"Without offering any explanation they manhandled him, strip-searched him and took him under restraint to a waiting van. Half an hour after their arrival in his room, the team delivered the applicant to Lawrence ward, where he remained under restraint until the team withdrew. The total period of restraint lasted for about 50 minutes.</p> <p>\"The response of the applicant to these events was an immediate refusal to take food or nutritionally sweetened drinks.

      "bodyText": "The decision to force-feed Ian Brady was \"in all respects lawful, rational and fair,\" ruled Mr Justice Kay yesterday as he rejected the moors murderer's challenge to Ashworth hospital's refusal to let him starve. He said he was satisfied Brady had started the hunger strike in protest at being moved from one ward to another at the Merseyside hospital. The judge held that Brady had never told medical officer James Collins that it was his intention to starve himself to death. In reaching his decision, he had been swayed by Dr Collins, who described Brady as psychopathic, prone to narcissism, egocentricity, histrionics, obsessionality, need for control, paranoia, litigiousness, lack of remorse and lack of empathy. While Brady did not consent to artificial feeding via a tube inserted through his nose to his stomach, he did not offer any resistance either. According to Dr Collins, Brady had talked of receiving a massive psychological boost from previous hunger strikes which he saw as a battle of wills with the authorities. Dr Collins told the hearing, held in private at the high court in Liverpool last week at the request of Brady's solicitors, that after the transfer from Jade ward last September, he had \"felt the need to do something and get his own back and exercise the control and address the needs of his self confidence and narcissism\". The doctor had concluded that Brady's decision to refuse food was caused by the personality disorder. It was \"a very, very unusual decision by a very, very unusual person\" in circumstances which were not very unusual, though they were legitimate grounds for complaint. Brady's hunger strike began after a six-strong control and restraint team entered his room in full riot gear without warning on September 30, last year. The judge said: \"Without offering any explanation they manhandled him, strip-searched him and took him under restraint to a waiting van. Half an hour after their arrival in his room, the team delivered the applicant to Lawrence ward, where he remained under restraint until the team withdrew. The total period of restraint lasted for about 50 minutes. \"The response of the applicant to these events was an immediate refusal to take food or nutritionally sweetened drinks. From that day to this he has been on hunger strike. It is clear from the medical records and not disputed by the applicant that, in the early stages, his motive was to protest rather than to starve himself to death. He had deployed hunger strikes as a tactic with the prison authorities many years before.\" Under the mental health act 1983, patients suffering from a mental disorder may be given treatment against their will, including force-feeding, if the treatment is for the disorder they suffer from. The courts have held that this is lawful even if the patient is mentally competent to refuse the treatment. So a central issue in the Brady case was whether the force-feeding could be said to be treatment for his personality disorder. Under the broad wording of the particular section in the act, said the judge, a range of acts ancillary to the main treatment were covered. He was \"entirely satisfied\" that the decision to start and continue force-feeding was justified by the act and was \"in all respects lawful, rational and fair\". Where a case is not covered by the act, force-feeding can be done only if the patient lacks the mental capacity to take his own decisions. In that case the doctor can impose feeding in the patient's best interests. The judge said that had Brady's case not come under the act, feeding was still lawful because he lacked the capacity to take decisions as a result of his disorder, and doctors had lawfully taken the steps they did \"in what they have lawfully and reasonably perceived to be his best interests.\" Brady had been engaged in a battle of wills so that, as a result of his severe personality disorder, he had eschewed weighing up information and balancing risks and needs, which mean his decisions were taken without capacity. The judge said he was unable to arrive at a certain conclusion as to what Brady's present intention was. \"That is one of the consequences of trying to assess the workings of such a disordered personality and mind,\" he said. \"Looking at the history of the present hunger strike and what the applicant has and has not said about it, I can see very little material prior to the commencement of proceedings which would point to a clear, settled or unequivocal intention on the part of the applicant to starve himself to death. \"Dr Collins takes the view that these proceedings are a staging post on the road to renegotiations. \"In my judgment, that is probably correct and the likelihood (but not the certainty) is that the applicant is playing the system.\"",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>There was a moment at Twickenham last Saturday when it became clear that a new world sporting order was in place. It was, by no coincidence at all, precisely the same moment that the shouty Welshman a couple of seats along from me finally sank his head in mute resignation. Garin Jenkins, the traditionally shaped Welsh hooker, a man whose chest begins just below his chin and continues south to his knees, had just lost the ball and looked up to see an awful white spectre swish past. It was Phil Greening, his opposite number, gambolling towards the line like a teenage full-back. Jenkins wheezed off in futile pursuit but the look on his face said it all: I am history. </p> <p>In every sport, fitness and conditioning are on the march. Footballers who eat bananas are no longer considered deviants, runners bore on about their body-fat ratios, even hookers have ceased to be beer monsters. Microseconds win trophies and microseconds are now earned in the gym. </p> <p>And nowhere is the change more noticeable than in formula one. Stirling Moss and Graham Hill might have warmed up for a grand prix season with a pipe and a handy Chateau Margaux, Nigel Mansell might have thought he was keeping in shape with the odd round of golf, but most of the drivers lining up at the start of tomorrow's Australian grand prix will have spent the past three months undertaking the kind of intensive training regimes more normally associated with Olympic oarsmen; most, though not Eddie Irvine, a driver whose idea of a cardiovascular work-out involves uncorking a bottle of Veuve Clicquot while cruising with a yacht-full of models round St Tropez harbour. </p> <p>\"I hear guys like Eddie saying they can go down the pub every night and still climb in a car the next morning,\" says Bernie Shrosbree, of the Benetton formula one team. \"But Eddie, you're not world champion, mate. When you are, tell me about it.\" </p> <p>Shrosbree was talking as he showed me round Benetton's new human-performance centre, a \u00a34m facility at the team's headquarters a short spin from Silverstone. Formula one factories are mostly places that concentrate on mechanical performance, where mil lions are invested perfecting carbon-fibre wishbones and titanium push-rod rocker systems, the kind of engineering that can shave vital moments from lap times. But Shrosbree reckons that concentration on the fitness of the driver will produce equal dividends. </p> <p>\"A formula one race presents the physiological demands of a half-marathon. Plus, G-forces batter the driver, breaking down his strength continuously. Fatigue sets in, which is where mistakes are made. Quite simply, the fitter you are the better all your senses work,\" says Shrosbree, a former marine, triathlete and champion cross-country skier who, at the age of 41, is a terrifying advertisement for his cause. </p> <p>\"Everyone's talked about the need to get drivers fit but not many have done much about it, to be honest with you.\" </p> <p> But now Benetton have. Shrosbree presides over a state-of-the-art clinic chock-full with alarming-looking pieces of gym equipment more readily associated with Torquemada than Murray Walker. Since the beginning of January he has been putting the two Benetton drivers Giancarlo Fisichella and Alexander Wurz through a pounding physical routine here, generally lasting more than five hours a day. Three months of that and they must be astonishing specimens. </p> <p>\"People often ask me how fit they are,\" says Shrosbree, a man who, one suspects, is not easily satisfied. \"Compared to your average office worker, they're supermen. Compared to Daley Thompson, well... No disrespect, though, these guys have special skills. Just being superfit doesn't mean you'll win a formula one race. On the other hand, drivers need to be aware that they can't get away with that old cocky attitude of 'I can piss it' any more.\" </p> <p>Now that the season is about to start, Shrosbree's work with the Benetton pair is complete. He will remain in Britain helping sportsmen from other disciplines who have heard about his facility; the rallying champion Colin McRae is a regular. So, away from his iron gaze, will his drivers maintain their schedule? Or will they succumb to the circuit with its myriad distractions which Irvine finds so seductive? </p> <p>\"They will be accompanied by a physio at all times,\" says Shrosbree. \"But we have given them a routine that fits their needs. Ultimately it's up to them, but they're good lads, I think they are aware now it is in their best interests to keep it up.

      "bodyText": "There was a moment at Twickenham last Saturday when it became clear that a new world sporting order was in place. It was, by no coincidence at all, precisely the same moment that the shouty Welshman a couple of seats along from me finally sank his head in mute resignation. Garin Jenkins, the traditionally shaped Welsh hooker, a man whose chest begins just below his chin and continues south to his knees, had just lost the ball and looked up to see an awful white spectre swish past. It was Phil Greening, his opposite number, gambolling towards the line like a teenage full-back. Jenkins wheezed off in futile pursuit but the look on his face said it all: I am history. In every sport, fitness and conditioning are on the march. Footballers who eat bananas are no longer considered deviants, runners bore on about their body-fat ratios, even hookers have ceased to be beer monsters. Microseconds win trophies and microseconds are now earned in the gym. And nowhere is the change more noticeable than in formula one. Stirling Moss and Graham Hill might have warmed up for a grand prix season with a pipe and a handy Chateau Margaux, Nigel Mansell might have thought he was keeping in shape with the odd round of golf, but most of the drivers lining up at the start of tomorrow's Australian grand prix will have spent the past three months undertaking the kind of intensive training regimes more normally associated with Olympic oarsmen; most, though not Eddie Irvine, a driver whose idea of a cardiovascular work-out involves uncorking a bottle of Veuve Clicquot while cruising with a yacht-full of models round St Tropez harbour. \"I hear guys like Eddie saying they can go down the pub every night and still climb in a car the next morning,\" says Bernie Shrosbree, of the Benetton formula one team. \"But Eddie, you're not world champion, mate. When you are, tell me about it.\" Shrosbree was talking as he showed me round Benetton's new human-performance centre, a \u00a34m facility at the team's headquarters a short spin from Silverstone. Formula one factories are mostly places that concentrate on mechanical performance, where mil lions are invested perfecting carbon-fibre wishbones and titanium push-rod rocker systems, the kind of engineering that can shave vital moments from lap times. But Shrosbree reckons that concentration on the fitness of the driver will produce equal dividends. \"A formula one race presents the physiological demands of a half-marathon. Plus, G-forces batter the driver, breaking down his strength continuously. Fatigue sets in, which is where mistakes are made. Quite simply, the fitter you are the better all your senses work,\" says Shrosbree, a former marine, triathlete and champion cross-country skier who, at the age of 41, is a terrifying advertisement for his cause. \"Everyone's talked about the need to get drivers fit but not many have done much about it, to be honest with you.\" But now Benetton have. Shrosbree presides over a state-of-the-art clinic chock-full with alarming-looking pieces of gym equipment more readily associated with Torquemada than Murray Walker. Since the beginning of January he has been putting the two Benetton drivers Giancarlo Fisichella and Alexander Wurz through a pounding physical routine here, generally lasting more than five hours a day. Three months of that and they must be astonishing specimens. \"People often ask me how fit they are,\" says Shrosbree, a man who, one suspects, is not easily satisfied. \"Compared to your average office worker, they're supermen. Compared to Daley Thompson, well... No disrespect, though, these guys have special skills. Just being superfit doesn't mean you'll win a formula one race. On the other hand, drivers need to be aware that they can't get away with that old cocky attitude of 'I can piss it' any more.\" Now that the season is about to start, Shrosbree's work with the Benetton pair is complete. He will remain in Britain helping sportsmen from other disciplines who have heard about his facility; the rallying champion Colin McRae is a regular. So, away from his iron gaze, will his drivers maintain their schedule? Or will they succumb to the circuit with its myriad distractions which Irvine finds so seductive? \"They will be accompanied by a physio at all times,\" says Shrosbree. \"But we have given them a routine that fits their needs. Ultimately it's up to them, but they're good lads, I think they are aware now it is in their best interests to keep it up. We may not have the fastest car but we've got the best-prepared drivers and I'm convinced it will give us an edge.\" The proof of the Shrosbree way will come in Melbourne. But even if the Benetton car explodes in a plume of smoke on the first bend, the consolation is that at least his drivers will be in good enough shape to help push it back to the pits. Dons on a slippery slope from heaven When Sam Hammam heard this week that the transfer of John Hartson to Tottenham had fallen through he announced that God must be a Wimbledon season-ticket holder.

      "trailText": "<p>A group of untrained Sussex teenagers took over grand old Glyndebourne last week - and brought the house down with their opera, Zo\u00eb.  Erica Jeal finds out how they did it</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Last week something unusual happened in the music world: the critics united in joyful approval of a new opera called Zo\u00eb. They praised its \"darkling-chromatic, noir-ish\" sound (the Financial Times) and its cast of \"stars\" (the Independent). \"If I see another new opera as enthralling as Zo\u00eb this year,\" summed up Richard Morrison in the Times, \"I shall count myself very lucky.\" There was talk of a transfer to London and a TV broadcast. What made the raves remarkable is that they were about an opera performed by a bunch of teenagers, with a libretto by a scriptwriter from The Bill. Zo\u00eb was the latest offering from Glyndebourne's education department. </p> <p>The largely privately funded Glyndebourne had already proved it knew how to get things right. Misper, an opera for performers in their early teens, was staged in the main auditorium in February 1997 and was so successful, both educationally and artistically, that it was revived the following March. </p> <p>The re-opening of the Royal Opera House and the creation of smaller performance spaces within it has given the ROH education department a chance to catch up with Glyndebourne's exemplary record. One of the first shows staged in its Linbury studio theatre in December was an education project. Separation: The Story of Bullman and the Moonsisters was the result of a six-month collaboration between the ROH education department and St Clement Danes, a state primary school in the neighbourhood. Workshop-style classes drew out the children's ideas and led to the creation of a storyline, a libretto, music, designs and ultimately a complete and structured opera company entirely staffed by schoolchildren aged seven to 11. </p> <p>Every element of the production, from performing and fundraising to scenery building, was undertaken by the 101 children in the company. Professionals from the opera house were on hand to help, but the children were encouraged to work as independently as possible. A walk around the school in one of the periods set aside for opera would have convinced anyone that they were taking the work seriously: the two 10-year-old press officers, Jesus and Ryan, were so professional it seemed they had been doing the job for years. </p> <p>Only a handful of the pupils who helped write the score and played in the orchestra were taking individual music lessons and hardly any could read music, but that didn't matter. Working with glockenspiels, xylophones and every other percussion instrument imaginable, composer John Browne taught basic ideas of pulse, rhythm and imagery and guided the children as they developed these into melodies and accompaniments. The end result was described as \"inspiring, wildly entertaining and profoundly moving\" by Opera magazine. </p> <p>In contrast, Zo\u00eb was written for a cast of teenagers. Composer John Lunn and librettist Stephen Plaice used ideas from workshops they ran last summer in schools and sixth-form colleges around Brighton. Plaice found he didn't have to tone down the gritty style he had gleaned from The Bill - the happy ending he originally gave the work proved unpopular and was discarded for something that better reflected the dark side of adolescence. </p> <p>The story of Zo\u00eb touches on a whole range of subjects, from eco-warriors and student-teacher affairs through to a first kiss.

      "bodyText": "Last week something unusual happened in the music world: the critics united in joyful approval of a new opera called Zo\u00eb. They praised its \"darkling-chromatic, noir-ish\" sound (the Financial Times) and its cast of \"stars\" (the Independent). \"If I see another new opera as enthralling as Zo\u00eb this year,\" summed up Richard Morrison in the Times, \"I shall count myself very lucky.\" There was talk of a transfer to London and a TV broadcast. What made the raves remarkable is that they were about an opera performed by a bunch of teenagers, with a libretto by a scriptwriter from The Bill. Zo\u00eb was the latest offering from Glyndebourne's education department. The largely privately funded Glyndebourne had already proved it knew how to get things right. Misper, an opera for performers in their early teens, was staged in the main auditorium in February 1997 and was so successful, both educationally and artistically, that it was revived the following March. The re-opening of the Royal Opera House and the creation of smaller performance spaces within it has given the ROH education department a chance to catch up with Glyndebourne's exemplary record. One of the first shows staged in its Linbury studio theatre in December was an education project. Separation: The Story of Bullman and the Moonsisters was the result of a six-month collaboration between the ROH education department and St Clement Danes, a state primary school in the neighbourhood. Workshop-style classes drew out the children's ideas and led to the creation of a storyline, a libretto, music, designs and ultimately a complete and structured opera company entirely staffed by schoolchildren aged seven to 11. Every element of the production, from performing and fundraising to scenery building, was undertaken by the 101 children in the company. Professionals from the opera house were on hand to help, but the children were encouraged to work as independently as possible. A walk around the school in one of the periods set aside for opera would have convinced anyone that they were taking the work seriously: the two 10-year-old press officers, Jesus and Ryan, were so professional it seemed they had been doing the job for years. Only a handful of the pupils who helped write the score and played in the orchestra were taking individual music lessons and hardly any could read music, but that didn't matter. Working with glockenspiels, xylophones and every other percussion instrument imaginable, composer John Browne taught basic ideas of pulse, rhythm and imagery and guided the children as they developed these into melodies and accompaniments. The end result was described as \"inspiring, wildly entertaining and profoundly moving\" by Opera magazine. In contrast, Zo\u00eb was written for a cast of teenagers. Composer John Lunn and librettist Stephen Plaice used ideas from workshops they ran last summer in schools and sixth-form colleges around Brighton. Plaice found he didn't have to tone down the gritty style he had gleaned from The Bill - the happy ending he originally gave the work proved unpopular and was discarded for something that better reflected the dark side of adolescence. The story of Zo\u00eb touches on a whole range of subjects, from eco-warriors and student-teacher affairs through to a first kiss. The music takes in pop, dance, contemporary classical and trip-hop. It is scored for a full orchestra (at Glyndebourne last week it was played by the Brighton Youth Orchestra) and an electronic clip track of drum beats, samples and scratches. For seven weeks at the beginning of the year, rehearsals involving a cast of four adult professionals, eight teenage principals and a chorus of nearly 40 were held at a frosty and seemingly deserted Glyndebourne.

      "bodyText": "The home secretary, Jack Straw, has been asked by a Labour MP to set up an independent judicial inquiry following a Guardian investigation exposing the discredited methods used by the Metropolitan police's secretive anti-corruption squad. The Guardian also revealed last week that the complaints investigation branch (CIB) is itself under investigation in three separate inquiries following the collapse of four high profile trials against serving and former officers. Andrew Mackinlay, the MP for Thurrock in Essex, wrote to Mr Straw early in the week urging an independent inquiry, led by a high court judge, into the CIB, supported by a police investigation team with \"no links\" to the Met. Only this, he wrote, would \"reassure the public that all is being done to root out corruption\" in the Met. Mr Mackinlay is particularly concerned about the murky events surrounding two police operations and the role of the intelligence services. One of the operations, codenamed Cornwall, was a seriously flawed CIB investigation into one of Mr Mackinlay's constituents, Met Detective Inspector John Redgrave. Mr Redgrave and his partner, Detective Constable Michael Charman, have been under investigation by the CIB for six years. The CIB inquiry related to claims made in 1994 by an informant, Geoffrey Brennan. His information led Mr Redgrave and Mr Charman to set up a sting operation, codenamed Nightshade, a year earlier. One of Operation Nightshade's most promising lines of inquiry concerned an illegal arms deal via Sierra Leone. It was on-going when Brennan claimed to have given Mr Redgrave and Mr Charman \u00a350,000 to turn a blind eye to a theft. He later withdrew the allegation. CIB kept the two detectives under secret investigation in Operation Cornwall for the next three years. In 1997 they were suspended for a further three years even though CIB knew then that Mr Brennan had withdrawn his claim. Last December Mr Redgrave and Mr Charman were told by CIB that they would not face criminal proceedings, but they remain suspended on full pay with one disciplinary charge outstanding. Both detectives now hope a judicial inquiry will uncover whether they were the victims of a plot by the intelligence services to undermine Operation Nightshade and protect its targets, in particular a US-based gang of arms dealers who were never arrested. Mr Brennan had been approached in 1993 by a Texan-based gang with an offer to sell arms. The arms dealers were led by a shadowy American called Roger Crooks and boasted of high political connections. The weapons list on offer included M16 assault rifles, grenade and rocket launchers, plastic explosives, mines and ammunition. Two undercover Met officers under Mr Redgrave's control were introduced by Mr Brennan to the Texan gang, posing as buyers for Northern Ireland loyalist terrorists. The plan was to ship the arms from the US to Ireland via Sierra Leone where Mr Crooks was based. A series of negotiations in London and Houston were then secretly taped by the Met's undercover officers. Confidential Met and US customs documents seen by the Guardian confirm this and contradict claims by CIB and sections of the Met that the arms deal was not genuine but designed to disguise the two officers' corruption. The Guardian's investigation suggests there are sensitive diplomatic reasons which could explain why Operation Nightshade is still being officially denied. These are the issues which an judicial inquiry should address: \u0095Police documents show some of the arms on offer had been stolen from a national guard armoury in Florida. The Met undercover officer who negotiated the arms deal with Mr Crooks told the Guardian that US customs officers confirmed this to him. But a national guard spokesman is now denying there was such a robbery. \u0095The arms were to be routed by Mr Crooks through the Sierra Leone capital, Freetown, a centre of illegal gun and diamond dealing, to finance the civil war and associated regional conflicts. Mr Crooks had a diplomatic passport from the Sierra Leone government, and was the manager of several legitimate busineses. There is no suggestion that his employers knew about his arms dealing activities. \u0095On two occasions during Operation Nightshade, Mr Crooks was questioned, once by US customs in Houston and then by the Met's anti-terrorist squad (SO13) in London. On both occasions he apparently revealed his role in the arms deal but was allowed to go free. The Met undercover officer and Mr Redgrave confirmed this to the Guardian and said the security service MI5 was involved. Mr Crooks later claimed that throughout the arms deal he was acting as an informant. But the question is for whom? Dave Tucker, the then boss of SO13, which works closely with MI5, denied any knowledge of Mr Crooks or these events when contacted by the Guardian. \u0095Three years later, in May 1997, Mr Crooks was at the heart of a US navy plan to rescue American citizens stranded in Sierra Leone during another military coup. The British and US governments and international mining companies were heavily involved in Sierra Leone at the time. One year later foreign office officials and MI6 were exposed for breaking the government's own arms embargo by allowing a UK mercenary firm, Sandline, to supply arms to the deposed government. Mr Crooks was linked to Sandline's operation through the lease of a helicopter he owned. He was later deported from Sierra Leone in June 1998 by the restored government for allegedly supplying arms to the rebels. Mr Mackinlay, a member of the foreign affairs select committee which examined the Sandline affair in 1998, said: \"There are a number of questions that need to be answered and some issues that ought to be re-visited by parliament. \"These issues underscore the deficiency of scrutiny of the security services for which there is no parliamentary oversight.\" His call for an independent judicial inquiry is supported by former prime minister Sir Edward Heath and John Horam, Tory MP for Orpington.

When exercise seemed to be more about hard labour or Germanic naturism, she brought in the idea that it could be fun. Her instructions - \"Down with a bounce; with a bounce, come up\" - were catchwords, broadcast every morning at 6.45 in the BBC's first keep-fit programme.</p> <p>There was no nonsense about Eileen's ideas of health (and efficiency). Women, she believed, should start getting fit by standing properly at the sink, while men could \"take the bulge from their bodies by getting up from an armchair without putting their hands on the sides.\" She spent most of her life trying to make the flabby fit, through radio, television and personal appearances at rallies that took on the flavour of revivalist fervour.</p> <p>Born in Hertfordshire, Fowler was stage-struck as a child, much to the pain of her parents. But they eventually relented and allowed her to train in music and dance. At 18, she appeared in Wild Violets on the London stage.</p> <p>Her inspiration, she said, came from her French grand mother, who told her, somewhat enigmatically, that she should keep slim because \"you are only as good as your feet, Eileen.\" After a decade as an actress, she turned to fitness, a craze then sweeping 1930s Europe.</p> <p>From 1934-45, Fowler set up classes, encouraging everyone to exercise. Her first class was in a village at sixpence a go, but she soon graduated to putting a spring in the step of middle-class wives and factory workers. Having been rejected by the WAAF, she went around the country organising outdoor pageants, improvising with costumes made from blackout material. She also met her husband, a Rank Organisation executive. Her radio career began on April 1 1954; at its peak, it had half a million listeners.</p> <p>In 1956, Fowler launched the Keep-Fit Association, before moving to television, where she appeared with a line-up of glowing \"gels\" with EF emblazoned on their chests. Her first show drew 10,000 requests for her exercises, which had comforting titles such as \"stretchaway\", \"skipalong\" and \"swingtime\". Sacked from television a decade later, she returned in the 70s with a \"dance disco\" fitness programme. She also had an early-morning slot on the Today programme, which was once saved from the axe by public demand.</p> <p>There was never a chance that Eileen would stop jumping for joy. She was, after all, a pretty good advertisment for her philosophy; in her 60s she was, she said, \"just 2lb and 1in on the waistline more than when I was 20.\" Small and lithe, she kept going in good health almost to the end, encouraging fellow residents of her Colchester old people's home to keep on moving. \"My aim in life is to keep families fit,\" she said.</p> <p>Her husband died in 1987.</p> <p>\u0095 Eileen Fowler, keep-fit instructor, born 1906; died March 7 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the days before aerobics and working-out, Eileen Fowler, who has died aged 93, was Britain's first health guru. When exercise seemed to be more about hard labour or Germanic naturism, she brought in the idea that it could be fun. Her instructions - \"Down with a bounce; with a bounce, come up\" - were catchwords, broadcast every morning at 6.45 in the BBC's first keep-fit programme. There was no nonsense about Eileen's ideas of health (and efficiency). Women, she believed, should start getting fit by standing properly at the sink, while men could \"take the bulge from their bodies by getting up from an armchair without putting their hands on the sides.\" She spent most of her life trying to make the flabby fit, through radio, television and personal appearances at rallies that took on the flavour of revivalist fervour. Born in Hertfordshire, Fowler was stage-struck as a child, much to the pain of her parents. But they eventually relented and allowed her to train in music and dance. At 18, she appeared in Wild Violets on the London stage. Her inspiration, she said, came from her French grand mother, who told her, somewhat enigmatically, that she should keep slim because \"you are only as good as your feet, Eileen.\" After a decade as an actress, she turned to fitness, a craze then sweeping 1930s Europe. From 1934-45, Fowler set up classes, encouraging everyone to exercise. Her first class was in a village at sixpence a go, but she soon graduated to putting a spring in the step of middle-class wives and factory workers. Having been rejected by the WAAF, she went around the country organising outdoor pageants, improvising with costumes made from blackout material. She also met her husband, a Rank Organisation executive. Her radio career began on April 1 1954; at its peak, it had half a million listeners. In 1956, Fowler launched the Keep-Fit Association, before moving to television, where she appeared with a line-up of glowing \"gels\" with EF emblazoned on their chests. Her first show drew 10,000 requests for her exercises, which had comforting titles such as \"stretchaway\", \"skipalong\" and \"swingtime\". Sacked from television a decade later, she returned in the 70s with a \"dance disco\" fitness programme. She also had an early-morning slot on the Today programme, which was once saved from the axe by public demand. There was never a chance that Eileen would stop jumping for joy. She was, after all, a pretty good advertisment for her philosophy; in her 60s she was, she said, \"just 2lb and 1in on the waistline more than when I was 20.\" Small and lithe, she kept going in good health almost to the end, encouraging fellow residents of her Colchester old people's home to keep on moving. \"My aim in life is to keep families fit,\" she said. Her husband died in 1987. \u0095 Eileen Fowler, keep-fit instructor, born 1906; died March 7 2000",

      "body": "<p>Steven Spielberg is to receive a prestigious award for his film-making at a ceremony in Los Angeles tonight. </p> <p>But the award - which until now bore the name of the legendary director DW Griffith - has been renamed owing to protests over Griffith's 1915 film, The Birth of a Nation, which portrayed the Ku Klux Klan in a heroic light. </p> <p>Critics claim the film, which has often been hailed as the first American epic, promoted racism and caricatured black people. </p> <p>The controversy within the film industry over the name change is reminiscent of the arguments prompted by last year's lifetime achievement Oscar for the director Elia Kazan, which was awarded despite his having named names to the House Un-American Activities Committee in the 1950s. </p> <p>While some argue that Griffith was operating in a different time and climate, others say that to keep his name on the prize would be a continuing insult to African-Americans and a comfort to racists. </p> <p>The Directors Guild of America's award for lifetime achievement is handed out sparingly. Its recipients have included Orson Welles, Frank Capra, Cecil B deMille and Alfred Hitchcock. </p> <p>Tonight one of its past winners, Francis Ford Coppola, will present the award to Spielberg. But for the first time since the award began in 1953, Griffith's name will not be associated with the prize; it will now be called the DGA Lifetime Achievement award. </p> <p>Griffith, who died in 1948, came from a southern Confederate family and is described by the filmographer Ephraim Katz as \"the single most important figure in the history of American film\". </p> <p>The Oscar-winning film- maker William Friedkin, who directed The French Connection and The Exorcist, has called Griffith, who died a pauper, \"arguably the greatest name in American film\". </p> <p>The Birth of a Nation, a three-hour silent movie, was set during the civil war and based on the Rev Thomas Dixon's book The Clansman. </p> <p>The Klan members are shown as heroic figures and the African-Americans as debauched and savage creatures. In one famous scene a young white woman jumps to her death over a cliff to escape rape by a black man. </p> <p>Even at the time, the film, which starred Lillian Gish, caused great controversy, with some all-white audiences giving it standing ovations and calls by black groups and white liberals to ban it. </p> <p>Its technical brilliance has not been disputed but it is equally clear that the KKK experienced a surge in support on the back of the film. The Klan has a long and bloody history of lynching black people and the film was seen as pandering to those tendencies. </p> <p>Last year a number of African-American directors told the president of the DGA, Jack Shea, that there was much unhappiness about Griffith's name still being attached to the award. It was put to him that black directors, who are slowly growing in number, might not be able to accept the award. </p> <p>After consultations with surviving recipients, a proposal was made that the name be dropped - a move passed unanimously by the 44-strong national board of the guild. </p> <p>But the decision has provoked criticism. The National Society of Film Critics called it \"a depressing example of 'political correctness'\". </p> <p>Friedkin has also attacked the decision, saying it should have been debated by the membership beforehand. </p> <p>The National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP) was one of the earliest groups to speak out against the film and its acceptance as a \"classic\". </p> <p>Yesterday the NAACP's western regional director, Frank Berry, welcomed the decision to remove Griffith's name. \"It's been a long time coming,\" said Mr Berry, who added that many people were puzzled that it had taken the DGA so long. </p> <p>\"I'm happy that they're finally doing it,\" Mr Berry added. \"It is obviously a step in the right direction to stop glorifying people who have done such tremendous injustice.\"</p>",

The Directors Guild of America's award for lifetime achievement is handed out sparingly. Its recipients have included Orson Welles, Frank Capra, Cecil B deMille and Alfred Hitchcock. Tonight one of its past winners, Francis Ford Coppola, will present the award to Spielberg. But for the first time since the award began in 1953, Griffith's name will not be associated with the prize; it will now be called the DGA Lifetime Achievement award. Griffith, who died in 1948, came from a southern Confederate family and is described by the filmographer Ephraim Katz as \"the single most important figure in the history of American film\". The Oscar-winning film- maker William Friedkin, who directed The French Connection and The Exorcist, has called Griffith, who died a pauper, \"arguably the greatest name in American film\". The Birth of a Nation, a three-hour silent movie, was set during the civil war and based on the Rev Thomas Dixon's book The Clansman. The Klan members are shown as heroic figures and the African-Americans as debauched and savage creatures. In one famous scene a young white woman jumps to her death over a cliff to escape rape by a black man. Even at the time, the film, which starred Lillian Gish, caused great controversy, with some all-white audiences giving it standing ovations and calls by black groups and white liberals to ban it. Its technical brilliance has not been disputed but it is equally clear that the KKK experienced a surge in support on the back of the film. The Klan has a long and bloody history of lynching black people and the film was seen as pandering to those tendencies. Last year a number of African-American directors told the president of the DGA, Jack Shea, that there was much unhappiness about Griffith's name still being attached to the award. It was put to him that black directors, who are slowly growing in number, might not be able to accept the award. After consultations with surviving recipients, a proposal was made that the name be dropped - a move passed unanimously by the 44-strong national board of the guild. But the decision has provoked criticism. The National Society of Film Critics called it \"a depressing example of 'political correctness'\". Friedkin has also attacked the decision, saying it should have been debated by the membership beforehand. The National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP) was one of the earliest groups to speak out against the film and its acceptance as a \"classic\". Yesterday the NAACP's western regional director, Frank Berry, welcomed the decision to remove Griffith's name. \"It's been a long time coming,\" said Mr Berry, who added that many people were puzzled that it had taken the DGA so long. \"I'm happy that they're finally doing it,\" Mr Berry added. \"It is obviously a step in the right direction to stop glorifying people who have done such tremendous injustice.\"",

Her nose is stippled and she is covered in short, dense hair. Lola is a dog. My dog. When I first came to Berlin, I found it hard to see how anyone could keep a dog in trim. Every park I saw had a notice at the entrance warning that leads had to be be used at all times and listing stiff penalties awaiting owners who defied the bylaws. In the woodland which surrounds the city, there was an even more alarming sign, which showed a startled dog being tusked into the air. The forests of Berlin are alive with wild boar. Yet dogs are as common as house flies. There are more in Berlin than in most of Germany's other big cities put together. And an astonishing number can be found off their leads, not just rambling in the parks, but ambling along pavements, lounging in cafes and bars, and even in restaurants and clubs. Even members of the most popular breed, the pit bull terrier, roam about unhindered, along with rottweilers, dobermans and other dogs that look as if they eat a poodle or two for breakfast. A history professor, Wolfgang Wippermann, who has written a book about the Germans and their dogs, has unearthed municipal edicts, some dating back to the 18th century, with which the authorities had tried, with a uniform lack of success, to get the Berliners to put their dogs on leads. The other thing you notice is that there are no cats. Or at least not in sight. For a while, I thought they had been hunted to extinction by the dogs.

      "bodyText": "The German government yesterday announced controversial plans to recruit up to 30,000 computer specialists from outside the European Union to meet a drastic shortage of qualified workers in Germany's information technology industry. Under the scheme, which has been compared to America's green card system, Germany's strict immigration controls will be waived to allow an initial 10,000 non-EU computer and hi-tech specialists to enter the country this year. Last night IT recruitment specialists in the UK called for the government to introduce a similar scheme to stop British industry falling behind. \"If the Germans are going to introduce a scheme like this, why don't we? We have just as big a shortage in this area as anybody; there are always more jobs than suitable candidates,\" said John Ford, who runs an IT recruitment company in north London. \"We have a very considerable number of applicants from the Indian subcontinent every week for positions that we simply cannot fill, but because of the rules governing work permits we have to turn them down.\" Although the project faces opposition from German trade unions, government sources yesterday confirmed that plans to recruit a further 20,000 foreign computer experts would be discussed by the Social Democrat-Green coalition of the chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, at the end of the year. The measures are part of a personal initiative by Mr Schr\u00f6der aimed at overcoming a shortage of more than 75,000 qualified workers in the computer and hi-tech branch. The government also plans to increase the number of computer training opportunities from 14,000 to 40,000. But in an attempt to counter critics who claim that the intitiative is a back door to permanent immigration, the government has stipulated that its work permit system - unlike America's - will be limited to a maximum of five years. According to German press reports, suggestions that the government was about to open the way for a non-EU computer expert recruitment drive have already prompted German headhunters to seek staff in the Indian hi-tech cities of Bangalore and Hyderbad. The moves are a response to growing complaints from business and industry that Germany slept while its EU partners invested heavily in turning out qualified hi-tech workers. The recruitment drive amounts to a radical departure from the policies of the former chancellor Helmut Kohl's previous conservative government. Throughout its 16-year tenure, his Christian Democrat-led coalition rejected the idea of immigration quotas or importing non-EU labour despite the country's plunging birthrate. However, after initially opposing the idea, the conservatives have joined Germany's other main parties in supporting the recruitment drive. India's talent waiting in wings John Cassy India's software and information technology experts are so prized because they meet the global industry's two key requirements: they are highly educated and mostly English speaking. Their reputation for dedication is another bonus. Microsoft chairman Bill Gates was so impressed by the Indian pool in 1997 that he predicted the country would become a software superpower and then awarded the first Microsoft professorship outside the US to Delhi's Indian Institute of Technology. Bangalore is India's computer capital, a Silicon Val ley for the Indian sub-continent. Ten miles outside town is Electronic City, home to 80 mostly international companies like Oracle and NTT, and the centre of the fast-emerging sector. In export terms, the industry will be worth \u00a32.5bn this year and as much as \u00a312.5bn in three years, according to estimates. Wages of around \u00a3300 a month are nearly 10 times the average Indian's income but tiny by Western standards. Their European peers often earn six-figure annual packages. For skilled operators the lure of Germany could be strong.",

But she isn't: she originally planned to step down as chairman next year but now talks of carrying on for three years or more. </p> <p>The reason, you surmise, is that Cropper wants to help guide a company that has grown exponentially in the past two years through a corporate landscape where the advent of e-commerce will create such seismic changes many companies will be left in the craters. And her company, based on an exceptional business philosophy, faces exceptional challenges. </p> <p>FI, originally known as Freelancers International, is certainly an unusual company though you would not think so from its bog-standard headquarters on a business park in Hemel Hempstead. Essentially, it is run by women - Cropper and her long-standing colleague, Jo Connell, group managing director. </p> <p><strong> Intellectual capital</strong><br> </p> <p> But the times and culture have changed since it was founded in 1962 by Steve Shirley, a German-born Jewish woman, who ran it with an initial \u00a36 and a kitchen table for her office.

      "bodyText": "In this industry you've really got to reinvent yourself, says Hilary Cropper, executive chairman of IT outsourcing and management consultancy group FI. \"I joined at an early stage and it's gone on changing at such a rate of knots it's never gone stale and, frankly, we've not seen anything yet. \"The next 20 years will be even more exciting than the last 20 and you're constantly refreshed in your thinking.\" At 59, Cropper could be excused for thinking of retirement to the Dorset farm her husband, Peter, recently bought after reinventing himself following a parallel career in IT. But she isn't: she originally planned to step down as chairman next year but now talks of carrying on for three years or more. The reason, you surmise, is that Cropper wants to help guide a company that has grown exponentially in the past two years through a corporate landscape where the advent of e-commerce will create such seismic changes many companies will be left in the craters. And her company, based on an exceptional business philosophy, faces exceptional challenges. FI, originally known as Freelancers International, is certainly an unusual company though you would not think so from its bog-standard headquarters on a business park in Hemel Hempstead. Essentially, it is run by women - Cropper and her long-standing colleague, Jo Connell, group managing director. Intellectual capital But the times and culture have changed since it was founded in 1962 by Steve Shirley, a German-born Jewish woman, who ran it with an initial \u00a36 and a kitchen table for her office. Until the sex discrimination act of the mid-1970s FI employed only women. Cropper, who joined the computer software group as managing director in 1985, gives off little sense of the crusading feminist spirit that motivated its founder and dismisses any suggestion that a commercial outfit run by women is, well, more cooperative, collaborative and less cut-throat competitive. In fact, the corporate culture at FI is highly collaborative. But Cropper says: \"Maggie [Thatcher] was not a great collaborator. I have no idea whether it's to do with women: I've seen plenty of situations where women have done the opposite of what we're talking about. And I was educated in a convent and I don't remember much cooperation among the nuns.\" Her own business culture owes a great deal to her experiences working in large computing firms. \"I had seen - though I worked for outfits which treated me well - such a waste of human intellectual capital. \"I know I came here with a view that this thing was small enough to mould [it had sales of \u00a37m] and I was most definitely going to create a culture where that kind of near-repression simply didn't happen.

      "body": "<p>In 1945 Helen Bamber made the decision that was to shape her life. She was 19 years old, still a girl, when she told her parents that she was going to Belsen with the Jewish Relief Unit. She didn't quite know why she felt compelled to see, to smell, to understand the dreadful aftermath of Nazism, but she knew she had to. It was in Germany that Bamber decided the world was divided into two camps: bystanders and witnesses. Bystanders see what they want, turn away when it suits them, deny the evidence if necessary. Witnesses have a duty to observe and report truthfully. </p> <p>Now, 55 years on, Bamber still divides the world into bystanders and witnesses. As founder and director of the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, she has borne witness to myriad horror stories. At the foundation, she works as a psychotherapist, listening to clients for as long as they wish or can bear to talk. And when she's not listening, she is tending the foundation's ever expanding bureaucracy or travelling the world to discover the most repugnant details of the world's most oppressive regimes. The title of Neil Belton's recent biography of her, The Good Listener (Phoenix, \u00a37.99), is a perfect summation of her life and work: understated, to the point, practical - rather like the foundation itself. </p> <p>\"Helen is not an extraordinary person in many respects,\" says Sherman Carroll, her director of public affairs at the foundation. \"She's not an intellectual, she's not terribly well educated with a fancy degree, she's not a lawyer, not a doctor. She's an ordinary woman who has committed her life to good works. So in that sense she's amazing ... but ordinary.\" </p> <p>John McCarthy, the broadcaster and former hostage, remembers being as intrigued as he was impressed the first time he met her. \"She's tiny. She'll come to slightly above your waist,\" he says. \"Yet as you talk to her you realise there's a great deal of not just energy but power. She is an interesting mix - so caring and compassionate, but also direct and determined.\" </p> <p>When you enter the foundation you walk past a room full of disparate people, of all colours and nationalities. Many faces are marked with the lines and scars of struggle. One woman is laughing with a friend; one man holds the weight of his head - the world - in his hands; a couple of children run about the waiting room. You can't help wondering about their history. Where are they from? How did they offend their home state? Were they psychologically tortured, starved, beaten, locked in solitary? Can they ever be happy again? </p> <p>Helen Bamber, 74, seems even tinier than John McCarthy suggests. She's wearing a glistening white shirt that is buried inside a smart blue cardigan which trails down to her ankles. Her lips are glossed, her nails varnished in a transparent silver. Any number of bracelets dance up her arms. The foundation has just heard that General Pinochet will be returned to Chile, and she can't hide her despondency. She questions the value of the British medical reports and says she would be happy if the Chilean authorities disregarded them . </p> <p>She speaks softly and slowly, slightly pedantically. It's a lovely voice - ebbing and flowing, massaging. She gestures emphatically as she talks, and when this is pointed out she is a little embarrassed and defensive. \"So many of my clients put their hand on their heart when they want to express something. It's a language of the body.\" </p> <p>A conversation with Bamber soon turns to Belsen. She talks about how inexperienced she was, how she had to learn quickly. \"I realised after a time that I couldn't take away their suffering, or their images or their losses, or their terrible sense of unresolved grief. People would tell you their story and it would spill out like a kind of vomit. They would go on talking, talking, talking ...\" You can hear their despair in her voice. \"And what they were telling you was sometimes quite dreadful. After a while I began to realise the most important role for me there was to bear witness. Bearing witness to the vulnerability of humanity.\" </p> <p>She stops herself. \"It sounds a very pompous phrase doesn't it? But the evil that can be done to human beings is something that I suppose has dominated my life.\" </p> <p>Did her parents support her when she went to Germany? \"My father accepted it, almost with a shrug of resignation. I think it was something about repaying a debt. I was aware that if the Nazis had succceeded in invading England, we would have been the victims.\" </p> <p>Bamber grew up with a sense of persecution. Her father, Louis Balmuth, was born in New York, but his family returned to the Poland of the pogroms before emigrating to England in 1895 when he was nine. He was in his late 30s when he married Marie Bader, who had been born in Britain of Polish extraction. Bamber's first memories are of a huge house in north London's Amhurst Park that she shared with her extended family, a \"splendid house\" with its own billiards room. </p> <p>Louis was an accountant by day and a philosopher/scribbler/ mathematician by night. Marie was a singer and pianist who hoped that Helen would realise the dreams she had had for herself and become a celebrated performer. The house was owned by the mysterious Uncle Michael, who had made a fortune as a \"merchant\", though what he sold no one seemed to know. The Balmuths were clever, multilingual and argumentative, and unsympathetic to the ways and needs of children. Before long, the Depression swallowed up Michael's money, and Helen and her parents found themselves relegated to a much smaller home in nearby Stamford Hill. </p> <p>Fascism and its attendant fears were a backdrop to daily life. An educated pessimist, Louis Balmuth seemed to regard extermination as an inevitability. As the second world war scoured Europe, he listened to broadcasts by Goebbels, read young Helen extracts from Hitler's treatise Mein Kampf, and told her exactly what the Nazi leader was doing and where it would all end. Balmuth lived petrified by the past and in fear of the future. </p> <p>Bamber had initially been sent to a private Jewish school in London. But when her parents began to struggle financially she was switched to a multi-denominational primary, from where she won a scholarship to high school in Tottenham. This is where a teacher bawled her out for not knowing the second verse of the national anthem and told her that of all parents, the parents of Jewish children had a particular duty to make sure their children knew the anthem. </p> <p>She says her real education happened at home in early childhood. Bamber was a sick girl who spent much of her childhood bedridden with an illness that was probably TB. Relatives and refugee friends of her parents used to visit her, talk to her as if she were an adult and deliver bedside chats that could go on for days. She recalls a man who sat by her side explaining the first world war, and how the punitive settlement led to the rise of Hitler. </p> <p>Bamber didn't go to Belsen with a sense of mission, but with foreboding. \"I felt I had to face something, the fear in myself. I had to understand other people's fear, and I had to understand something about overcoming fear_ living. How does one live with the knowledge of atrocity?\" </p> <p>Henry Lunzer, her boss in the Jewish Relief Unit, still thinks of her as a \"lovely, vivacious little girl\". She was also a natural organiser. \"Helen just took charge of headquarters, administered the whole thing,\" says Lunzer. \"It was amazing at that age. God only knows what made her so efficient!\" When we talk about Lunzer, Bamber smiles abstractedly. He was \"quite a guy\", she says, \"looked very handsome in uniform, but then everyone looked good in uniform\". She pulls herself up abruptly: \"That's a stupid thing to say.\" </p> <p>Bamber founded the the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture in 1985. She had spent three decades campaigning for the human rights organisation Amnesty International, where she had started a group to help torture victims. Amnesty leaders decided that treating torture victims as well as campaigning against the regimes that abused them was too broad a remit, which spurred her to start the foundation. Today there are 85 paid staff and 110 volunteers. </p> <p> Although never formally trained, Bamber says she has no qualms about calling herself a psychotherapist - she has earned the title, having trained on the job for most of her life. Sheila Melzak, head of child and adolescent psychotherapy, at the foundation says she doesn't know how Bamber does it, but somehow people just open up to her. \"She's very moth erly, maternal, but not in a pampering way. All sorts of people feel safe with her, especially those who have missed out on parenting. They'll talk to her about the most private experiences.\" She says no level of training could equip someone with this skill, and suggests that it is down to Bamber's own childhood experiences. </p> <p>\"I do think it's because of her own lack of parenting in her childhood. Her father was passionate about human rights. Fixated. So she was taught from a very early age about repression and about how other people may challenge that. But as parents they were not particularly good at parenting.\" </p> <p>Bamber believes torture is a political act, but she says she must be careful here - the foundation is a charity, and it is important for it not to be perceived as politically motivated. \"For me, torture is about total helplessness and total power, the deliberate destruction of people. It often can be at the instigation of the government, carried out by their henchmen. It is about the destruction of human beings, often while keeping them alive. Torture has been described as the attempt to kill a person without their dying.\" </p> <p>The foundation exists to help people like Luis Mu\u00f1oz who was tortured by Pinochet's henchmen. In 1974 his wife, a journalist who had written a book about Chile's ruling class, disappeared and he never saw her again. He was 26, she was 23. Mu\u00f1oz was then thrown into a torture centre. He was beaten, kicked, forced to hang by his arms. His torturers attached electrodes to his mouth, his ears his eyes, his penis, his anus and his toes. They applied a soldering iron to his testicles. \"They thought I was going to die, but they didn't want me dead yet, so they stopped the shock treatment and put me in a wooden box and deprived me of sleep, food and hygiene. There was a little hole for ventilation. They put me in there to drive me mad.\" </p> <p>After three months in the torture centre, he was put in solitary confinement for another couple of months before being transferred to a concentration camp. On the way, the guards tormented him with a mock execution. Mu\u00f1oz pleaded with them to kill him. \"I thought I'd be better off dead, I'd given up.\" </p> <p>When he arrived in Britain in 1977 he suffered depression, panic attacks and guilt, in addition to considerable physical pain. He first met Bamber when he and fellow Chilean refugees were on a 16-day hunger strike protesting against Pinochet. He discovered that Bamber, like him, lived in London's Muswell Hill, and after that they kept bumping into each other on the 43 bus. \"She was very concerned about me. She knew more about my physical and mental health than I did at the time.\" Bamber told him he looked terrible, broken, that he needed help. \"She doesn't let go. You can't evade her. She's very persistent. If you keep stuff from her, she won't give up.\" </p> <p>He started going to Bamber for therapy. \"For a long time I thought that if you talk about what happened to you, you'll hurt the person; you think it's too much for anyone else to bear. But Helen can contain you. She enables you to cry.\" </p> <p> Luis Mu\u00f1oz is what Bamber would call a creative survivor. She says there is so much rubbish talked about survivors and victims, as if survival itself is enough. But people have to be shown how to live again. She cites the strongest she found at Belsen - those who formed political committees, held religious meetings, started a theatre, forced themselves into being more than helpless victims. In a strange way the culture that grew out of concentration camps like Belsen become a template for the foundation. It is not simply a clinic where victims come to unveil themselves of their histories, but a cultural centre with allotments, holiday clubs, chess groups and drawing classes. </p> <p>Creative survival is also about allowing people to grieve. Bamber talks about the Jews who came to Britain after the Holocaust and found themselves in a new world where they had to put their past behind them because it was not acknowledged, a world where they had to make do and get on. Many Jewish people did get on, but without an emotional release some imploded. </p> <p>\"That is something I feel so strongly about here. How do you retrieve their memory of somebody so you can bury them in an appropriate way, and not be fixed on their grotesque way of dying? I think many of us have found ways of sitting with people and retrieving that young man or woman by talking about the way they looked, the way they dressed, the way they smoked, and their irritating ways. You can bring the person back as they were in the best of memories, and you then see it's time to bury them.\" She apologises for her bluntness. </p> <p>Soon after returning from Belsen she married Rudi Bamberger, who changed his named to the more British Bamber. He had escaped from Germany and the thugs who destroyed his parents' house and beat his father to death with fists and truncheons. There was tenderness and love in their relationship, but it was doomed. Like her father, Rudi was a terminal pessimist. He was drowning in his own darkness, and Bamber couldn't cope. Although her father had been more articulate about his helplessness, they shared the same quietness, the sense of having withdrawn from life. Living with victims is a very different matter to working with them, says Bamber. They divorced after 23 years together. </p> <p>\"It's not that one doesn't have affections or love, but very often somebody who has survived becomes disassociated from themselves as well as other people.\" She is almost whispering. \"That was quite hard to live with - someone who was cut off from communication. You couldn't have spontaneity or celebration.\" </p> <p>She says it would have been easier to divorce if they had simply not liked each other. \"I was very sad for a long time. I think I'm still very sad.\" For many years she has lived by herself in Muswell Hill. Life was tough after they split up. She worked as a medical secretary at St George's hospital in east London, but was always broke. Their two sons Jonathan (now a physicist), and David (a sculptor whose work often alludes to the Holocaust), attended separate schools, she didn't have a car, the house they lived in was condemned. </p> <p>John Rundle, a doctor who has known Bamber for 30 years and now works at the foundation, thinks struggle has made her what she is today. \"If you're capable of dealing with the sorts of people we get here I don't think you could come from a jolly-hockey-sticks, wonderfully protective background. Helen has been fighting adversity ever since she was at Belsen. I don't think life has left her much room for personal comforts.\" </p> <p>In some ways the breakdown of her marriage was liberating. Because she was short of money she rented rooms to foreign students. Suddenly her morose, dilapidated home was transformed by youth and optimism. \"I suppose I began to laugh a lot when they were around. We had fun, we danced, we cooked, I used to book the entire launderette on a Sunday afternoon. There were six or seven students at a time, every nationality under the sun, and there would be great battles or debates about the virtues of eating rhinoceros. There hadn't been much laughter in my parents' home or in my married life.\" </p> <p>Bamber has a lovely girlish giggle, and can extract humour from the grimmest situations. She says the ability to laugh is terribly important, especially in someone so prone to crying. Does she cry at work? \"No. I can listen to the most appalling stories that people tell me, I can bear it.\" She says the one thing she can't cope with is hearing people sing. \"We used to hold a music group downstairs. And sometimes there would be singing, and this I could hardly bear. We had a terribly sad woman from Iran who used to sit there and do very little, and then she sang, and I had to leave the room. There's something about the human voice; seeing what capacity people have for creativity and what's denied them. Perhaps it's about what people might be if left alone.\" </p> <p>Bamber has a famously tough exterior - the woman who gets things done. When asked for five words to describe his mother, Jonathan Bamber chooses: \"Driven, focused, dedicated, slightly obsessive . . . She has an unimaginable amount of energy, disappearing off to Uganda, to Kosovo, to the West Bank, all of the most horrible, devastated places in the world. I am exactly half her age and I would struggle to maintain that schedule.\" Bamber is quietly proud of what she is achieving at her age. She mentions a few times that she will be 75 in May. </p> <p>Monday to Friday she deals with the bureaucracy, at the weekend she sees clients. Her biographer Neil Belton says: \"She works harder than anybody else at the foundation. She is obsessive. It can drive people mad.\" Sheila Melzak says that she is finally learning to let go a bit, to delegate, though she's still reluctant to cede control. . \"But recently, more and more, I've seen she can have fun.\" </p> <p>Bamber says she understands why she puts up a tough front, but doesn't like it. She talks about how she felt sorry for her parents, their sense of failure and unhappiness, and how she never wanted anyone to feel sorry for her. \"I wanted to see myself as a very strong person not showing vulnerability, and I don't think this is helpful to people. It can be very irritating, to put it mildly. I get irritated with myself, so it's not surprising others do.\" </p> <p>John Rundle says she is much more vulnerable than she lets on. \"I think there are times when she is very upset by the intolerable experiences people go through.\" It has been suggested there is a masochistic streak in Bamber that forces her to go on, but Rundle disagrees. \"I don't think it's obsessional or pathological. I think it's that she's been challenged. She knows the evil of mankind, and she won't put up with it. It's a crusade if you like. But it's not done as a zealot, it's done as a human being.\" </p> <p>While much of Bamber's early middle age was devoted to the domestic, bringing up Jonathan and David, she also managed to hold down a series of demanding jobs - acting almoner (social worker) at Middlesex Hospital, administrator at the Middlesex and personal assistant to the brilliant orthopaedic surgeon Sir Herbert Seddon. For many years she couldn't see a pattern to her life. It's only recently that she has begun to realise it has all been of a piece - from her father; to Belsen; to Rudi, her husband; to Amnesty; to the foundation. </p> <p>There was also her work with Dr Maurice Pappworth, a much-loved and vilified campaigner against the abuses that go on in the name of medical experimentation. Bamber met Pappworth at St George's where he was a consultant. Bamber would help him with his administration, and they would talk in his rooms for hours about the overuse of drugs, unnecessary surgery, the Nazi doctors' malign experimentation. Bamber says Pappworth educated her about medical ethics. \"He was as preoccupied as I was with this question of total power, total helplessness.\" Together they compiled an archive of abuses. John Rundle, who was taught by Pappworth, describes him as the greatest doctor he met. \"Like a lot of very clever people he was succinct and simple because he grasped all the underlying principles, and Helen's very much the same. She tends to be a person of few words, straight to the point.\" </p> <p>Bamber is fidgeting again, desperate to get back to work. \"It's like sitting here when Rome is burning.\" The therapists at the foundation see their own therapists, or supervisors, to make sure they are still up to the job. Her supervisor gives her a hard time for over-working. Is she right? \"I don't think I'm terribly good at taking care of myself.\" Perhaps work is her way of looking after herself? \"I think it is. I think it gives me a lot of hope, a lot of personal help. I get a lot back from the people we treat in terms of seeing them grow and develop and overcome.\" </p> <p>Neil Belton talks about the paradox of the carer. \"You can get a lot of satisfaction from being an omnipotent carer. There's a little bit of God that attaches to it, the way people come to rely on her. She is aware of that element.\" </p> <p>Does she think there is a danger of playing God? She doesn't answer directly. \"You have to be clear that you have tremendous limitations in this work; you know you're going to lose some along the line.\" </p> <p>Belton spent three years writing The Good Listener. He says: \"Helen remains an enigma to me. Most activists I've known don't retain the humour and human sympathy she brings to her work, the ability to focus on individuals. There's a side that's just the grimly dedicated campaigner, but another that brings a great deal of joy and light.\" </p> <p>Earlier this year, the government introduced its immigration and asylum act, which has resulted in asylum seekers living off vouchers instead of real money while being banned from earning their own. Families have been dispersed across the country. \"At least when Jewish people came to Britain after the war, they were allowed to live in communities,\" says Bamber. \"I feel so ashamed of the situation.\" </p> <p> John McCarthy says: \"She starts from the basic premise of right and wrong. You need a fair degree of anger to do her work.\" Bamber agrees. She says that anger can be a tremendous creative driving force, that without it none of the world's most pernicious regimes would have been defeated. </p> <p>In an earlier conversation she had talked about her need for openness, the need to challenge her parents' generations who refused to admit to or share what they had been through. Out of nowhere, she says: \"I know that my husband and I did pass on something about the secrecy to our children. I know we did try to protect them from the full knowledge of what had happened, and I don't know that I blame myself for that. </p> <p>\"When one of my sons was very young he asked me whether his grandfather had been shot, and I said 'yes', which was a lie, because he was beaten to death in front of his family. At what age do you say that to a child? I suppose I didn't want them to have the same knowledge that I had when I was growing up\" - the knowledge she desperately sought out. Bamber never attempts to reconcile her contradictions. </p> <p>She offers a cigarette from a dusty box. She likes seeing people smoke, she says: it reminds her of the war. She is stroking the hair of a beautifully dressed soft doll that Chilean clients have made to raise money. She is talking about the disappointments in her life; how this fiercely independent woman had always aspired to Sunday-lunch domesticity. \"I never quite pulled it off. I didn't achieve the married life that I wanted, so there have been gaps and loneliness as well, yes.\" </p> <p>We talk about how important Judaism has been to her. Yes, she says, but that doesn't make her a believer. \"It's very curious because I'm always moved by other people's devotion. But I don't have that sense of devotion. I must believe in something.\" And for once she's struggling to make sense of herself. Slowly, diffidently the words form. \"I suspect that it's believing that even though I see a great deal of evil, there's something very good to be retrieved from people.\"</p> <p><strong> Life at a glance</strong></p> <p><strong>Born: </strong> London, May 1, 1925. </p> <p><strong> Education: </strong> Down Lanes Central School; part-time social science student, London School of Economics. </p> <p><strong> Married: </strong> 1947 Rudi Bamberger, divorced 1970. </p> <p><strong> Work: </strong> 1945<strong> </strong> volunteer on one of first rehabilitation teams to enter Belsen concentration camp; senior case worker, Committee for the care of Children from Concentration Camps (1947-1954); almoner at St George's hospital east London (1956); founder member, National Association for the Welfare of Children in Hospital (1961); joined Amnesty 1961; founded Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture (1985). </p> <p><strong> Other positions: </strong> Advisory board, Gaza Community Mental Health; patron, Women Against Violence, Belfast. </p> <p><strong> Awards:</strong> European Woman of Achievement (1993), in recognition of work with survivors of repression and torture; OBE (1997).</p>",

      "bodyText": "In 1945 Helen Bamber made the decision that was to shape her life. She was 19 years old, still a girl, when she told her parents that she was going to Belsen with the Jewish Relief Unit. She didn't quite know why she felt compelled to see, to smell, to understand the dreadful aftermath of Nazism, but she knew she had to. It was in Germany that Bamber decided the world was divided into two camps: bystanders and witnesses. Bystanders see what they want, turn away when it suits them, deny the evidence if necessary. Witnesses have a duty to observe and report truthfully. Now, 55 years on, Bamber still divides the world into bystanders and witnesses. As founder and director of the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, she has borne witness to myriad horror stories. At the foundation, she works as a psychotherapist, listening to clients for as long as they wish or can bear to talk. And when she's not listening, she is tending the foundation's ever expanding bureaucracy or travelling the world to discover the most repugnant details of the world's most oppressive regimes. The title of Neil Belton's recent biography of her, The Good Listener (Phoenix, \u00a37.99), is a perfect summation of her life and work: understated, to the point, practical - rather like the foundation itself. \"Helen is not an extraordinary person in many respects,\" says Sherman Carroll, her director of public affairs at the foundation. \"She's not an intellectual, she's not terribly well educated with a fancy degree, she's not a lawyer, not a doctor. She's an ordinary woman who has committed her life to good works. So in that sense she's amazing ... but ordinary.\" John McCarthy, the broadcaster and former hostage, remembers being as intrigued as he was impressed the first time he met her. \"She's tiny. She'll come to slightly above your waist,\" he says. \"Yet as you talk to her you realise there's a great deal of not just energy but power. She is an interesting mix - so caring and compassionate, but also direct and determined.\" When you enter the foundation you walk past a room full of disparate people, of all colours and nationalities. Many faces are marked with the lines and scars of struggle. One woman is laughing with a friend; one man holds the weight of his head - the world - in his hands; a couple of children run about the waiting room. You can't help wondering about their history. Where are they from? How did they offend their home state? Were they psychologically tortured, starved, beaten, locked in solitary? Can they ever be happy again? Helen Bamber, 74, seems even tinier than John McCarthy suggests. She's wearing a glistening white shirt that is buried inside a smart blue cardigan which trails down to her ankles. Her lips are glossed, her nails varnished in a transparent silver. Any number of bracelets dance up her arms. The foundation has just heard that General Pinochet will be returned to Chile, and she can't hide her despondency. She questions the value of the British medical reports and says she would be happy if the Chilean authorities disregarded them . She speaks softly and slowly, slightly pedantically. It's a lovely voice - ebbing and flowing, massaging. She gestures emphatically as she talks, and when this is pointed out she is a little embarrassed and defensive. \"So many of my clients put their hand on their heart when they want to express something. It's a language of the body.\" A conversation with Bamber soon turns to Belsen. She talks about how inexperienced she was, how she had to learn quickly. \"I realised after a time that I couldn't take away their suffering, or their images or their losses, or their terrible sense of unresolved grief. People would tell you their story and it would spill out like a kind of vomit. They would go on talking, talking, talking ...\" You can hear their despair in her voice. \"And what they were telling you was sometimes quite dreadful. After a while I began to realise the most important role for me there was to bear witness. Bearing witness to the vulnerability of humanity.\" She stops herself. \"It sounds a very pompous phrase doesn't it? But the evil that can be done to human beings is something that I suppose has dominated my life.\" Did her parents support her when she went to Germany? \"My father accepted it, almost with a shrug of resignation. I think it was something about repaying a debt. I was aware that if the Nazis had succceeded in invading England, we would have been the victims.\" Bamber grew up with a sense of persecution. Her father, Louis Balmuth, was born in New York, but his family returned to the Poland of the pogroms before emigrating to England in 1895 when he was nine. He was in his late 30s when he married Marie Bader, who had been born in Britain of Polish extraction. Bamber's first memories are of a huge house in north London's Amhurst Park that she shared with her extended family, a \"splendid house\" with its own billiards room. Louis was an accountant by day and a philosopher/scribbler/ mathematician by night. Marie was a singer and pianist who hoped that Helen would realise the dreams she had had for herself and become a celebrated performer. The house was owned by the mysterious Uncle Michael, who had made a fortune as a \"merchant\", though what he sold no one seemed to know. The Balmuths were clever, multilingual and argumentative, and unsympathetic to the ways and needs of children. Before long, the Depression swallowed up Michael's money, and Helen and her parents found themselves relegated to a much smaller home in nearby Stamford Hill. Fascism and its attendant fears were a backdrop to daily life. An educated pessimist, Louis Balmuth seemed to regard extermination as an inevitability. As the second world war scoured Europe, he listened to broadcasts by Goebbels, read young Helen extracts from Hitler's treatise Mein Kampf, and told her exactly what the Nazi leader was doing and where it would all end. Balmuth lived petrified by the past and in fear of the future. Bamber had initially been sent to a private Jewish school in London. But when her parents began to struggle financially she was switched to a multi-denominational primary, from where she won a scholarship to high school in Tottenham. This is where a teacher bawled her out for not knowing the second verse of the national anthem and told her that of all parents, the parents of Jewish children had a particular duty to make sure their children knew the anthem. She says her real education happened at home in early childhood. Bamber was a sick girl who spent much of her childhood bedridden with an illness that was probably TB. Relatives and refugee friends of her parents used to visit her, talk to her as if she were an adult and deliver bedside chats that could go on for days. She recalls a man who sat by her side explaining the first world war, and how the punitive settlement led to the rise of Hitler. Bamber didn't go to Belsen with a sense of mission, but with foreboding. \"I felt I had to face something, the fear in myself. I had to understand other people's fear, and I had to understand something about overcoming fear_ living. How does one live with the knowledge of atrocity?\" Henry Lunzer, her boss in the Jewish Relief Unit, still thinks of her as a \"lovely, vivacious little girl\". She was also a natural organiser. \"Helen just took charge of headquarters, administered the whole thing,\" says Lunzer. \"It was amazing at that age. God only knows what made her so efficient!\" When we talk about Lunzer, Bamber smiles abstractedly. He was \"quite a guy\", she says, \"looked very handsome in uniform, but then everyone looked good in uniform\". She pulls herself up abruptly: \"That's a stupid thing to say.\" Bamber founded the the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture in 1985. She had spent three decades campaigning for the human rights organisation Amnesty International, where she had started a group to help torture victims. Amnesty leaders decided that treating torture victims as well as campaigning against the regimes that abused them was too broad a remit, which spurred her to start the foundation. Today there are 85 paid staff and 110 volunteers. Although never formally trained, Bamber says she has no qualms about calling herself a psychotherapist - she has earned the title, having trained on the job for most of her life. Sheila Melzak, head of child and adolescent psychotherapy, at the foundation says she doesn't know how Bamber does it, but somehow people just open up to her. \"She's very moth erly, maternal, but not in a pampering way. All sorts of people feel safe with her, especially those who have missed out on parenting. They'll talk to her about the most private experiences.\" She says no level of training could equip someone with this skill, and suggests that it is down to Bamber's own childhood experiences. \"I do think it's because of her own lack of parenting in her childhood. Her father was passionate about human rights. Fixated. So she was taught from a very early age about repression and about how other people may challenge that. But as parents they were not particularly good at parenting.\" Bamber believes torture is a political act, but she says she must be careful here - the foundation is a charity, and it is important for it not to be perceived as politically motivated. \"For me, torture is about total helplessness and total power, the deliberate destruction of people. It often can be at the instigation of the government, carried out by their henchmen. It is about the destruction of human beings, often while keeping them alive. Torture has been described as the attempt to kill a person without their dying.\" The foundation exists to help people like Luis Mu\u00f1oz who was tortured by Pinochet's henchmen. In 1974 his wife, a journalist who had written a book about Chile's ruling class, disappeared and he never saw her again. He was 26, she was 23. Mu\u00f1oz was then thrown into a torture centre. He was beaten, kicked, forced to hang by his arms. His torturers attached electrodes to his mouth, his ears his eyes, his penis, his anus and his toes. They applied a soldering iron to his testicles. \"They thought I was going to die, but they didn't want me dead yet, so they stopped the shock treatment and put me in a wooden box and deprived me of sleep, food and hygiene. There was a little hole for ventilation. They put me in there to drive me mad.\" After three months in the torture centre, he was put in solitary confinement for another couple of months before being transferred to a concentration camp. On the way, the guards tormented him with a mock execution. Mu\u00f1oz pleaded with them to kill him. \"I thought I'd be better off dead, I'd given up.\" When he arrived in Britain in 1977 he suffered depression, panic attacks and guilt, in addition to considerable physical pain. He first met Bamber when he and fellow Chilean refugees were on a 16-day hunger strike protesting against Pinochet. He discovered that Bamber, like him, lived in London's Muswell Hill, and after that they kept bumping into each other on the 43 bus. \"She was very concerned about me. She knew more about my physical and mental health than I did at the time.\" Bamber told him he looked terrible, broken, that he needed help. \"She doesn't let go. You can't evade her. She's very persistent. If you keep stuff from her, she won't give up.\" He started going to Bamber for therapy. \"For a long time I thought that if you talk about what happened to you, you'll hurt the person; you think it's too much for anyone else to bear. But Helen can contain you. She enables you to cry.\" Luis Mu\u00f1oz is what Bamber would call a creative survivor. She says there is so much rubbish talked about survivors and victims, as if survival itself is enough. But people have to be shown how to live again. She cites the strongest she found at Belsen - those who formed political committees, held religious meetings, started a theatre, forced themselves into being more than helpless victims. In a strange way the culture that grew out of concentration camps like Belsen become a template for the foundation. It is not simply a clinic where victims come to unveil themselves of their histories, but a cultural centre with allotments, holiday clubs, chess groups and drawing classes. Creative survival is also about allowing people to grieve. Bamber talks about the Jews who came to Britain after the Holocaust and found themselves in a new world where they had to put their past behind them because it was not acknowledged, a world where they had to make do and get on. Many Jewish people did get on, but without an emotional release some imploded. \"That is something I feel so strongly about here. How do you retrieve their memory of somebody so you can bury them in an appropriate way, and not be fixed on their grotesque way of dying? I think many of us have found ways of sitting with people and retrieving that young man or woman by talking about the way they looked, the way they dressed, the way they smoked, and their irritating ways. You can bring the person back as they were in the best of memories, and you then see it's time to bury them.\" She apologises for her bluntness. Soon after returning from Belsen she married Rudi Bamberger, who changed his named to the more British Bamber.

She says the ability to laugh is terribly important, especially in someone so prone to crying. Does she cry at work? \"No. I can listen to the most appalling stories that people tell me, I can bear it.\" She says the one thing she can't cope with is hearing people sing. \"We used to hold a music group downstairs. And sometimes there would be singing, and this I could hardly bear. We had a terribly sad woman from Iran who used to sit there and do very little, and then she sang, and I had to leave the room. There's something about the human voice; seeing what capacity people have for creativity and what's denied them. Perhaps it's about what people might be if left alone.\" Bamber has a famously tough exterior - the woman who gets things done. When asked for five words to describe his mother, Jonathan Bamber chooses: \"Driven, focused, dedicated, slightly obsessive . . . She has an unimaginable amount of energy, disappearing off to Uganda, to Kosovo, to the West Bank, all of the most horrible, devastated places in the world. I am exactly half her age and I would struggle to maintain that schedule.\" Bamber is quietly proud of what she is achieving at her age. She mentions a few times that she will be 75 in May. Monday to Friday she deals with the bureaucracy, at the weekend she sees clients. Her biographer Neil Belton says: \"She works harder than anybody else at the foundation. She is obsessive. It can drive people mad.\" Sheila Melzak says that she is finally learning to let go a bit, to delegate, though she's still reluctant to cede control. . \"But recently, more and more, I've seen she can have fun.\" Bamber says she understands why she puts up a tough front, but doesn't like it. She talks about how she felt sorry for her parents, their sense of failure and unhappiness, and how she never wanted anyone to feel sorry for her. \"I wanted to see myself as a very strong person not showing vulnerability, and I don't think this is helpful to people. It can be very irritating, to put it mildly. I get irritated with myself, so it's not surprising others do.\" John Rundle says she is much more vulnerable than she lets on. \"I think there are times when she is very upset by the intolerable experiences people go through.\" It has been suggested there is a masochistic streak in Bamber that forces her to go on, but Rundle disagrees. \"I don't think it's obsessional or pathological. I think it's that she's been challenged. She knows the evil of mankind, and she won't put up with it. It's a crusade if you like. But it's not done as a zealot, it's done as a human being.\" While much of Bamber's early middle age was devoted to the domestic, bringing up Jonathan and David, she also managed to hold down a series of demanding jobs - acting almoner (social worker) at Middlesex Hospital, administrator at the Middlesex and personal assistant to the brilliant orthopaedic surgeon Sir Herbert Seddon. For many years she couldn't see a pattern to her life. It's only recently that she has begun to realise it has all been of a piece - from her father; to Belsen; to Rudi, her husband; to Amnesty; to the foundation. There was also her work with Dr Maurice Pappworth, a much-loved and vilified campaigner against the abuses that go on in the name of medical experimentation. Bamber met Pappworth at St George's where he was a consultant. Bamber would help him with his administration, and they would talk in his rooms for hours about the overuse of drugs, unnecessary surgery, the Nazi doctors' malign experimentation. Bamber says Pappworth educated her about medical ethics. \"He was as preoccupied as I was with this question of total power, total helplessness.\" Together they compiled an archive of abuses. John Rundle, who was taught by Pappworth, describes him as the greatest doctor he met. \"Like a lot of very clever people he was succinct and simple because he grasped all the underlying principles, and Helen's very much the same. She tends to be a person of few words, straight to the point.\" Bamber is fidgeting again, desperate to get back to work. \"It's like sitting here when Rome is burning.\" The therapists at the foundation see their own therapists, or supervisors, to make sure they are still up to the job. Her supervisor gives her a hard time for over-working. Is she right? \"I don't think I'm terribly good at taking care of myself.\" Perhaps work is her way of looking after herself? \"I think it is. I think it gives me a lot of hope, a lot of personal help. I get a lot back from the people we treat in terms of seeing them grow and develop and overcome.\" Neil Belton talks about the paradox of the carer. \"You can get a lot of satisfaction from being an omnipotent carer. There's a little bit of God that attaches to it, the way people come to rely on her. She is aware of that element.\" Does she think there is a danger of playing God? She doesn't answer directly. \"You have to be clear that you have tremendous limitations in this work; you know you're going to lose some along the line.\" Belton spent three years writing The Good Listener. He says: \"Helen remains an enigma to me. Most activists I've known don't retain the humour and human sympathy she brings to her work, the ability to focus on individuals. There's a side that's just the grimly dedicated campaigner, but another that brings a great deal of joy and light.\" Earlier this year, the government introduced its immigration and asylum act, which has resulted in asylum seekers living off vouchers instead of real money while being banned from earning their own. Families have been dispersed across the country. \"At least when Jewish people came to Britain after the war, they were allowed to live in communities,\" says Bamber. \"I feel so ashamed of the situation.\" John McCarthy says: \"She starts from the basic premise of right and wrong. You need a fair degree of anger to do her work.\" Bamber agrees. She says that anger can be a tremendous creative driving force, that without it none of the world's most pernicious regimes would have been defeated. In an earlier conversation she had talked about her need for openness, the need to challenge her parents' generations who refused to admit to or share what they had been through. Out of nowhere, she says: \"I know that my husband and I did pass on something about the secrecy to our children. I know we did try to protect them from the full knowledge of what had happened, and I don't know that I blame myself for that. \"When one of my sons was very young he asked me whether his grandfather had been shot, and I said 'yes', which was a lie, because he was beaten to death in front of his family. At what age do you say that to a child? I suppose I didn't want them to have the same knowledge that I had when I was growing up\" - the knowledge she desperately sought out. Bamber never attempts to reconcile her contradictions. She offers a cigarette from a dusty box. She likes seeing people smoke, she says: it reminds her of the war. She is stroking the hair of a beautifully dressed soft doll that Chilean clients have made to raise money. She is talking about the disappointments in her life; how this fiercely independent woman had always aspired to Sunday-lunch domesticity. \"I never quite pulled it off. I didn't achieve the married life that I wanted, so there have been gaps and loneliness as well, yes.\" We talk about how important Judaism has been to her. Yes, she says, but that doesn't make her a believer. \"It's very curious because I'm always moved by other people's devotion. But I don't have that sense of devotion. I must believe in something.\" And for once she's struggling to make sense of herself. Slowly, diffidently the words form. \"I suspect that it's believing that even though I see a great deal of evil, there's something very good to be retrieved from people.\" Life at a glance Born: London, May 1, 1925.

Jamie Bawn grows up in the shadow of his father - fired by drink, violence and despair - and his grandfather, a devout socialist who plans to sweep away slums and replace them with palaces in the sky. Both are indelibly Scottish - reflections of their country's post-war dreams and post-industrial decay. Yet until Jamie returns to look after his dying grandfather, the pieces of his family jigsaw fail to fit. O'Hagan is a master of epiphany: in his hands the slightest incident acquires significance.

Through her hero, Sobran Jodeau, Knox tells of vendanges, wars, progress, passion and death in a small Burgundy village. Jodeau's midsummer trysts with Xas, all pale skin and expressive wings, cause Jodeau spiritual headaches as well as an urge to sin. There is only one possible conclusion - a fall from grace. Despite its angelic writing and inspired structure, however, the divine and the everyday do not quite mesh into a satisfying whole. </p> <p> <strong> Midwinter Of The Spirit</strong><br> by Phil Rickman<br> (Pan, \u00a35.99) <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501842974,00.html\">Buy it from BOL</a></p> <p> If it weren't for the profession of its heroine, Rickman's Hereford-set thriller would be a dead cert for Sunday evening television. But it's not just that Merrily Watkins is a heavy-smoking female vicar who swears like a trooper on occasion. She also runs the diocesan \"deliverance ministry\" - that's exorcism to lay folk. Even before she gets a flash office under the nose of her trendy bishop boss, things start going bump all over the county and Merrily has to calm spirits both quick and dead. Rickman does the supernatural stuff with \u00e9lan and builds around his heroine a rich hinterland of politicking clerics and mother-daughter growing pains - all of which makes for an entertaining read, with shivers.</p> <p> <strong> Stolen Marches</strong><br> by David Crackanthorpe<br> (Review, \u00a36.99) <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501843685,00.html\">Buy it from BOL</a></p> <p>A wartime thriller with a human face, Crackanthorpe's debut deals with the reckonings which come at war's end. Stephen Seagrove is estranged from his family and from England. His war has been spent with the resistance in southern France harrying the occupiers and preparing for the revolution which will surely come after liberation. A chance photograph taken of a Frenchman watching the deportation of French Jews and his personal quest to find Ida, his gypsy lover, ensure that for Seagrove peace is more deadly than war. Crackanthorpe, a first-time novelist at 71, weaves a complicated plotline around his romantic hero - more Wordsworthian than Byronic - but his laconic prose sidesteps both sentimentality and derring-do.</p>",

Its pompous opacity makes it a nice subject for gentle satire, especially given that its proponents generally operate in the infinitely send-uppable world of academia. Both David Lodge and Malcolm Bradbury have made a second, and far more profitable, living out of poking fun at their colleagues' perennial obsession with the difference between reality and make-believe, while firmly holding on to their university posts. </p> <p>In her third novel, Kate Atkinson has a crack at the none-too-subtle business of metafiction. Emotionally Weird - an unexplained and inexplicably grotty title that suggests a rather different kind of book - is teeming with various fictions; the book itself boasts a bewildering array of typefaces. A more insidious by-product of this carnival of confabulation is that, after a while, the reader has no idea what's true and what isn't. By that point, Atkinson is relying, rather too heavily at times, on the fact that we won't care, so beguiled are we by her narrative exuberance and comic invention. </p> <p>The thrust of the novel takes place in two main fonts. The first, a no-nonsense sans serif, maroons us on a bleak, wind-lashed island, \"a speck of peat and heather pricked with thistles\", where Euphemia Stuart-Murray - Effie for short, luckily - and her mother Nora are telling each other stories to while away the austere hours. Effie's story, which takes up by far the bigger portion of the book, focuses on her days as an English student at the University of Dundee in the early 70s, and is thoroughly, deliberately inconsequential. It is almost literally a shaggy dog story - great chunks of it revolve around the proprietorship of a stray canine - its utter unimportance in inverse proportion to its narrator's garrulousness. The novel also exploits the convention that the story less told is the one we want to hear more of, so that while Effie's account of her student days proliferates wildly, her mother's story - concerned with Effie's mysterious parentage - sputters out painfully and haltingly, keeping us, for the most part, in the dark. </p> <p>Of the other typefaces, a typewriter-style font brings us instalments of student Effie's assignment for her creative-writing course, a seaside thriller; a crazy gothic number signals the Middle Earthish fantasies of one of Effie's classmates; pseudo-handwriting gives away a would-be Mills &amp; Boon romance called The Wards of Love ; and a tellingly hard-to-read face alerts us to The Expanding Prism of J , the magnum opus of Effie's theory-mad tutor. </p> <p>Everybody in Emotionally Weird is trying to write, and most of them are dreadful at it. For Effie, however, the matter is doubly pressing. In her account of her undergraduate days, life is a fast-enclosing crisis of unmet deadlines, in which she is pursued with dream-like intensity for her detective story, her essay on George Eliot and her dissertation, \"Henry James - Man or Maze?\". On the island hideout it is her mother who constantly prompts and provokes her to further excesses of storytelling, while simultaneously chiding her for her inability to sustain plot development or character. \"It's been nothing but ringing telephones and boiling kettles, doorbells and toilets, since you began,\" she remarks querulously, but not altogether unjustly. </p> <p>Much of Atkinson's strength as a writer lies in her talent for observational humour. It's hard not to laugh at her Scottish faculty life 70s-style, which at times combines the savagery of The History Man with the surrealism of A Very Peculiar Practice . Effie's tuned-out boyfriend Bob puzzling over predicate logic while watching Star Trek , a community of hessian-clad hippies trying ineptly to slaughter a goat, a Marxist structuralist lecturer bludgeoning the finer points of Derrida and Barthes into a group of largely unconcerned teenagers - all these are woven into a comic caper with an impressive cast of private dicks, OAPs on the run and precocious children. </p> <p>Up against this determinedly whimsical competition, Atkinson's second story fares badly, and she never manages to establish the vexed relationship between Nora and Effie, ostensibly the more interesting tale, as a going concern. As for any comment on the nature of what we might call intertextuality, forget it. One suspects Atkinson herself is well aware that she's much better performing a funny turn than telling us anything serious; Emotionally Weird is firmly subtitled \"A Comic Novel\". Take out the typefaces and banish the overly ponderous outer reaches of this book and it's just a series of gags; but they're pretty good gags, and it's none the worse for that.</p>",

For decades after 1945, the systematic murder of Europe's Jews was subjected to a silence which almost amounted to a taboo. It was an obscenity that could not be mentioned, should not be thought about. Survivors were told to forget, relatives of victims pretended their loved ones had died in obscure circumstances. How to explain the shift from virtual silence to obsession? Peter Novick sets out to give some answers, dismissing early on the Freudian theory of repression of trauma leading to problems at a later date. He is considering collective rather than personal memory; his subject is America, and more particularly American Jewry, who, he points out, have always seen themselves as far removed from the Europe their grandfathers left a century ago. </p> <p>Although Novick is writing about the US, much that he has to say is relevant for this country too. We read the same books, see the same films, have begun to memorise the event and its victims in the same way. Primo Levi, first published in obscurity, is now famous. Novick puts much of this in historical perspective: he begins by reminding his readers that the truth of the death camps emerged at the end of a war which had killed between 50 and 60 million people, and that a few months after the camps were liberated came Hiroshima, which, in the years to follow, loomed much larger in the popular imagination, since it represented the future rather than the past. Nazi Germany was finished; a nuclear standoff was the new threat and the USSR the new ogre. In addition, the immediate post-war years were upbeat and optimistic. The Allies had won the war and the emphasis now was on looking to the future, on the task of reconstruction. And, I might add, no one had a greater need to rebuild their lives than Jews directly affected by the Holocaust. Nobody wanted to look back. </p> <p>Two factors loom large in Novick's analysis of American Jewry's changing perception of the Holocaust. One is the existence of Israel and the continuing problems of the Middle East, and the other is a significant change in the US itself. In the immediate post-war years America had an integrationist ethic: everyone was first and foremost an American. In recent years people have begun to regard themselves primarily as Hispanics, blacks, Irish American or whatever. American Jews, for so long assimilationist and often totally secular, began to identify with their distant relatives across the seas. </p> <p>With this new concern over ethnic roots has come a culture of victimhood which, in the US, goes along with a competition between ethnic groups, women and gays - what Novick calls the \"Victimisation Olympics\". American blacks in particular suffer from \"Holocaust envy\", which is distasteful and can surface in the most unlikely places. The dedication to Toni Morrison's Beloved , a novel about slavery, reads \"60 million and more\", a figure clearly picked out of the air but not at random. That such a cheap jibe should come from a writer of her quality is shocking. </p> <p>Novick also points to a growing paranoia among American Jews, who in fact have never had it so good. They now regard themselves as the perpetual victims of history, and worry about what will happen to them \"next time\". This helps to bolster Israel's cause. In fact, American Jewry is the most successful socioeconomic group; this is very galling to American blacks, who have lost their martyr's crown to a group infinitely better off than themselves. Novick stops short of saying so, but it is among blacks that anti-Semitism is most virulent. </p> <p>Post-war Americans believed in heroism; so did Israelis in the early years. The supposed passive victimhood of European Jews was regarded as shameful. Early Zionists had seen Hitler's persecution of the Jews as a great opportunity to promote their cause - a benevolent catastrophe - and even refused to divert funds earmarked for buying Arab land to the rescue of Jews. The mood changed markedly from the time of the Yom Kippur war, when Israel's difficulties grew and she often found herself isolated, criticised even by her cold-war ally. From now on the Holocaust was increasingly invoked to rally international (particularly American) support, and the \"myth\", as Novick calls it, grew that Israel had been created as a consequence of Allied guilt at failing to rescue Europe's Jews. In fact, he writes, no guilt was felt - rather a considerable sympathy for the survivors (known as \"displaced persons\") - and the creation of Israel was the cheapest way of dealing with them. </p> <p>Invocation of the Holocaust by pro-Israelis could be blatant. In 1981 Hyman Bookbinder wrote to the German Ambassador to the US, saying that plans for the Washington Holocaust Museum were now being developed. \"How Germany will be treated in that museum,\" he wrote, \"will be affected by the decision you make pertaining to the sale of arms to Saudi Arabia.\" </p> <p>Novick's analysis is lively, cool-headed and balanced, but I think that he does on occasion over- simplify. For instance, he points out that in the immediate post-war period the murder of Europe's Jews was seen as only part of Nazi barbarism; it took 20 years for the term \"Holocaust\" to come into common usage, and with it the notion that it was a unique event. He argues, rightly, that every historical event is to some extent unique; but it was also right that, after the dust of the second world war began to settle, people (not just Jews) should regard it as different in kind from other horrors of the century. </p> <p>The same holds true of his discussion of guilt: its roots may be deeper and more complex than he is able or willing to acknowledge. In recent years much American attention has focused on failure to rescue Europe's Jews from the jaws of death, most notably by bombing parts of Auschwitz or the railway tracks leading to it. Novick dismisses this notion without much difficulty: the plan was in fact considered and found to be utterly impractical. Precision bombing was not possible at the time and any such attempt could only have harmed the people it was intended to help. However, one real source of Western guilt lies elsewhere, and remains unexplored, probably because of its contemporary implications. Not much could be done for more than a handful of Jews once the war started, but very many could have been saved between 1933 and 1939, when tens of thousands were clamouring for political asylum. </p> <p>At the end of his book Novick investigates the supposed \"lessons\" of the Holocaust only in terms of rescue, and comes to the unsurprising conclusion that the US continues to act from self-interest, rarely intervenes abroad for humanitarian reasons and, when it does, makes a mess of it. Immigration policy is not mentioned again after the early pages, and there Novick comes across as an apologist. Roosevelt's failure to change the US immigration laws - whereby there was a strict annual quota according to the country of origin - is put down to opposition from Congress which, with high unemployment, was in favour of reducing the quotas. His plea that refugees should be generously treated was not consistently imple mented, and from 1939 his main aim was to try to get the US involved in the European conflict. And, adds Novick, hindsight is all very well, but who could guess what would happen to those people? Well, by the early summer of 1939, when almost 1,000 Jews found themselves stranded off the American coast when their Cuban visas were unexpectedly cancelled, those on board had little doubt about how the persecution was likely to end. The story reveals the intransigence of the US quota system: eventually the desperate passengers were returned to Europe and \"shared out\" among several kinder countries which, except for Britain, were all overrun by the Germans, so their fate was sealed. </p> <p>Louise London's book, Whitehall and the Jews, on the other hand, is solely concerned with Britain's immigration policy towards Jewish refugees and betrays, despite the academic methodology, an underlying passion and occasional sense of outrage. There are good reasons for this. London is a solicitor who has specialised in immigration cases, and she is herself the daughter of Jewish refugees. </p> <p>Unlike the US, Britain had no immigration policy, which makes it something of a miracle that about 90,000 Jews found sanctu ary here. By the 1930s Britain no longer considered itself a country of immigration, so anyone admitted had to be an exception to the rule - except that there were no rules. It had no refugee law either. Since every applicant was a special case and required personal vetting, officials increasingly found themselves overwhelmed by caseloads as the crisis in Europe intensified. Visas were introduced, shifting the workload from ports of entry to the country of origin, most commonly the British Consulate in Berlin. British self-interest was predominant in the selection procedure, and nobody was admitted without a financial guarantor. The many doctors and dentists applying were kept to a minimum, even though they were needed, because professional organisations in Britain objected. Single women and girls were almost always admitted provided they agreed to do domestic work, since British women had rebelled against servitude and there was a shortage of housemaids. Thousands of highly educated women now found themselves learning to wield a duster. </p> <p> The British method of muddling through had its advantages. The home office studiously avoided keeping statistics on Jewish immigration, thus avoiding the need to answer embarrassing questions in the House of Commons. Officials could use their personal judgment, and personal sympathy often played its part as they bent the guidelines or even ignored them. Refugees were admitted on a temporary basis - officially \"in transit\" - even though it became increasingly obvious that there was nowhere for them to go. The dominions were unhelpful, the US unbending, and in Palestine the Arabs began to protest. </p> <p>Public opinion is always a factor in a democracy. It hampered Roosevelt, and London sees it as an important influence in British government circles. The government did not want to raise the spectre of anti-semitism and create a \"Jewish problem\". Yet as the persecution of the Jews grew more vicious there was genuine public indignation, and with it came demands for more help to be given. </p> <p>Chamberlain, who himself accepted anti-Semitic stereotypes, was appalled by the barbarity of Kristallnacht, which undoubtedly helped to speed up immigration procedures. (No sense of public outrage figures in Novick's account.) Thousands of unaccompanied children were brought out of Germany. Money and offers of help began to pour in from non-Jewish sources, especially after Baldwin made a broadcast appeal. A story of British compromise and fudge, then, but also of decency and kindness.</p> <p>\u0095 To order a copy of The Holocaust and Collective Memory at the discount price of \u00a315.99 plus 99p p&amp;p, call the Guardian CultureShop on 0800 3166 102.</p>",

And, I might add, no one had a greater need to rebuild their lives than Jews directly affected by the Holocaust. Nobody wanted to look back. Two factors loom large in Novick's analysis of American Jewry's changing perception of the Holocaust. One is the existence of Israel and the continuing problems of the Middle East, and the other is a significant change in the US itself. In the immediate post-war years America had an integrationist ethic: everyone was first and foremost an American. In recent years people have begun to regard themselves primarily as Hispanics, blacks, Irish American or whatever. American Jews, for so long assimilationist and often totally secular, began to identify with their distant relatives across the seas. With this new concern over ethnic roots has come a culture of victimhood which, in the US, goes along with a competition between ethnic groups, women and gays - what Novick calls the \"Victimisation Olympics\". American blacks in particular suffer from \"Holocaust envy\", which is distasteful and can surface in the most unlikely places. The dedication to Toni Morrison's Beloved , a novel about slavery, reads \"60 million and more\", a figure clearly picked out of the air but not at random. That such a cheap jibe should come from a writer of her quality is shocking. Novick also points to a growing paranoia among American Jews, who in fact have never had it so good. They now regard themselves as the perpetual victims of history, and worry about what will happen to them \"next time\". This helps to bolster Israel's cause. In fact, American Jewry is the most successful socioeconomic group; this is very galling to American blacks, who have lost their martyr's crown to a group infinitely better off than themselves. Novick stops short of saying so, but it is among blacks that anti-Semitism is most virulent. Post-war Americans believed in heroism; so did Israelis in the early years. The supposed passive victimhood of European Jews was regarded as shameful. Early Zionists had seen Hitler's persecution of the Jews as a great opportunity to promote their cause - a benevolent catastrophe - and even refused to divert funds earmarked for buying Arab land to the rescue of Jews. The mood changed markedly from the time of the Yom Kippur war, when Israel's difficulties grew and she often found herself isolated, criticised even by her cold-war ally. From now on the Holocaust was increasingly invoked to rally international (particularly American) support, and the \"myth\", as Novick calls it, grew that Israel had been created as a consequence of Allied guilt at failing to rescue Europe's Jews. In fact, he writes, no guilt was felt - rather a considerable sympathy for the survivors (known as \"displaced persons\") - and the creation of Israel was the cheapest way of dealing with them. Invocation of the Holocaust by pro-Israelis could be blatant. In 1981 Hyman Bookbinder wrote to the German Ambassador to the US, saying that plans for the Washington Holocaust Museum were now being developed. \"How Germany will be treated in that museum,\" he wrote, \"will be affected by the decision you make pertaining to the sale of arms to Saudi Arabia.\" Novick's analysis is lively, cool-headed and balanced, but I think that he does on occasion over- simplify. For instance, he points out that in the immediate post-war period the murder of Europe's Jews was seen as only part of Nazi barbarism; it took 20 years for the term \"Holocaust\" to come into common usage, and with it the notion that it was a unique event. He argues, rightly, that every historical event is to some extent unique; but it was also right that, after the dust of the second world war began to settle, people (not just Jews) should regard it as different in kind from other horrors of the century. The same holds true of his discussion of guilt: its roots may be deeper and more complex than he is able or willing to acknowledge. In recent years much American attention has focused on failure to rescue Europe's Jews from the jaws of death, most notably by bombing parts of Auschwitz or the railway tracks leading to it. Novick dismisses this notion without much difficulty: the plan was in fact considered and found to be utterly impractical. Precision bombing was not possible at the time and any such attempt could only have harmed the people it was intended to help. However, one real source of Western guilt lies elsewhere, and remains unexplored, probably because of its contemporary implications. Not much could be done for more than a handful of Jews once the war started, but very many could have been saved between 1933 and 1939, when tens of thousands were clamouring for political asylum. At the end of his book Novick investigates the supposed \"lessons\" of the Holocaust only in terms of rescue, and comes to the unsurprising conclusion that the US continues to act from self-interest, rarely intervenes abroad for humanitarian reasons and, when it does, makes a mess of it. Immigration policy is not mentioned again after the early pages, and there Novick comes across as an apologist. Roosevelt's failure to change the US immigration laws - whereby there was a strict annual quota according to the country of origin - is put down to opposition from Congress which, with high unemployment, was in favour of reducing the quotas. His plea that refugees should be generously treated was not consistently imple mented, and from 1939 his main aim was to try to get the US involved in the European conflict. And, adds Novick, hindsight is all very well, but who could guess what would happen to those people? Well, by the early summer of 1939, when almost 1,000 Jews found themselves stranded off the American coast when their Cuban visas were unexpectedly cancelled, those on board had little doubt about how the persecution was likely to end. The story reveals the intransigence of the US quota system: eventually the desperate passengers were returned to Europe and \"shared out\" among several kinder countries which, except for Britain, were all overrun by the Germans, so their fate was sealed. Louise London's book, Whitehall and the Jews, on the other hand, is solely concerned with Britain's immigration policy towards Jewish refugees and betrays, despite the academic methodology, an underlying passion and occasional sense of outrage. There are good reasons for this. London is a solicitor who has specialised in immigration cases, and she is herself the daughter of Jewish refugees. Unlike the US, Britain had no immigration policy, which makes it something of a miracle that about 90,000 Jews found sanctu ary here. By the 1930s Britain no longer considered itself a country of immigration, so anyone admitted had to be an exception to the rule - except that there were no rules. It had no refugee law either. Since every applicant was a special case and required personal vetting, officials increasingly found themselves overwhelmed by caseloads as the crisis in Europe intensified. Visas were introduced, shifting the workload from ports of entry to the country of origin, most commonly the British Consulate in Berlin. British self-interest was predominant in the selection procedure, and nobody was admitted without a financial guarantor. The many doctors and dentists applying were kept to a minimum, even though they were needed, because professional organisations in Britain objected. Single women and girls were almost always admitted provided they agreed to do domestic work, since British women had rebelled against servitude and there was a shortage of housemaids. Thousands of highly educated women now found themselves learning to wield a duster. The British method of muddling through had its advantages. The home office studiously avoided keeping statistics on Jewish immigration, thus avoiding the need to answer embarrassing questions in the House of Commons. Officials could use their personal judgment, and personal sympathy often played its part as they bent the guidelines or even ignored them. Refugees were admitted on a temporary basis - officially \"in transit\" - even though it became increasingly obvious that there was nowhere for them to go. The dominions were unhelpful, the US unbending, and in Palestine the Arabs began to protest. Public opinion is always a factor in a democracy. It hampered Roosevelt, and London sees it as an important influence in British government circles. The government did not want to raise the spectre of anti-semitism and create a \"Jewish problem\". Yet as the persecution of the Jews grew more vicious there was genuine public indignation, and with it came demands for more help to be given. Chamberlain, who himself accepted anti-Semitic stereotypes, was appalled by the barbarity of Kristallnacht, which undoubtedly helped to speed up immigration procedures. (No sense of public outrage figures in Novick's account.) Thousands of unaccompanied children were brought out of Germany. Money and offers of help began to pour in from non-Jewish sources, especially after Baldwin made a broadcast appeal. A story of British compromise and fudge, then, but also of decency and kindness. \u0095 To order a copy of The Holocaust and Collective Memory at the discount price of \u00a315.99 plus 99p p&amp;p, call the Guardian CultureShop on 0800 3166 102.",

You might think this would sit oddly in down-to-earth Yorkshire and provincial France - and it is a genre that can irritate - yet Harris accomplishes it remarkably smoothly, without ever getting cute or unlikely, even when indulging in astral travel and chatty vintages.

When Joe moves on without leaving a forwarding address, the angry, deserted teenage Jay rejects all things magical. Yet in later life, now a fatally blocked author, he discovers a crate of Joe's special wines and finds his way to a new home in France, where Joe's astral form guides him to self-discovery (and a new, improved love interest). </p> <p>Oddly enough, the strands of this novel that jar the reader into disbelief are not the magical-realist ones but some of the supposedly true-to-life characters, whose stories raised my eyebrows in mean-minded suspicion, while only a few pages previously I'd downed the herbal potion for invisibility without a murmur of protest. </p> <p>Witchcraft aside, Harris is at her best when detailing the sensual pleasures of taste and smell. As chocoholics stand advised to stock up on some of their favourite bars before biting into Chocolat , so boozers everywhere should get a couple of bottles in before opening Blackberry Wine .

      "trailText": "<p>James Wood  hails the tart comic vision and sharp style of Anne Enright, who once again proves with her new book, What Are You Like?, that she is a highly original writer</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> What Are You Like?</strong> by Anne Enright <br>259pp, Cape, \u00a310</p> <p> Since it is by definition not imitative of anyone else, an original style has only itself to imitate; it is its own mockingbird. And the risk genuinely original writing runs is that a distinctive style can come to seem, in its very individuality, unnaturally sealed off from the ordinary, rather unoriginal world we inhabit. </p> <p>Anne Enright is a very original writer - a spry surrealist who challenges the world with extraordinary, lancing sentences. She is indeed a kind of mockingbird: she and her characters see life with a tart comedy which is briskly ascetic, sourly lucid and never quite accountable. It is partly that Enright uses words you do not expect her to use; more than this, she speeds up the connections between thoughts (one of Bergson's definitions of the comic) and between the sensations her unhappy characters experience. </p> <p>Thus the people in her fiction are always simultaneously quicker and more confused than those in more ordinary novels: they are cognitive zealots. For instance, one of the heroines of her new novel, Maria , visits a family farm as an unhappy adolescent. She hates her time there and, to make things worse, is made to act as waitress to her various adult cousins. Enright offers these compact sentences: \"She picked up the jug. She poured, and the milk smelt of everything.\" A second sentence perfect in its simplicity and its complexity, exactly catching the limitlessness of a child's rage. </p> <p>The danger is that Enright's curious characters will seem not only zealots but neurasthenic clowns, rushing between various mental junctions. Yet Enright's brittle, sometimes artificial style finds its proper counterpart in the two strange and brittle heroines at the heart of her fine novel. Maria and Rose are twins, separated at birth when their mother died in the hospital. Maria stayed with her father in Dublin, and Rose was adopted by an English couple in Surrey. Until late in the novel neither is sure of the other's existence, feeling it only as a dumb severance. Both are deeply unhappy in similar ways, and the novel's narration bounces between parallel accounts of their separate unhappinesses. We see Maria's childhood in Ireland and glimpse the frozen misery of her father's marriage to his second wife (wonderfully summarised as a woman with \"a big anxious head and smug little feet\"). At 20, Maria goes to New York, and some of the novel's most affecting writing evokes that city surreally, as a kind of Circumlocution Office of lost souls - of people suing or arbitrarily having sex with each other. Maria works as a cleaning lady for wealthy Upper West Siders; she feels that \"she looks like a perfect stranger, like a girl you would pass on the street\". </p> <p>Meanwhile Rose, back in England, pities and despises her unobservant, bien-pensant parents, who are forever taking in abandoned children and stray cats. Like Maria she feels unmoored, alien to herself, and like Maria she specialises in self-destruction. Her relationships with men are lumpy and doomed; though a talented violinist, she summarily abandons the instrument because she feels she is not good enough. The novel gradually drives these two spiky, miserable mates together, but its quality lies not in their eventual recognition of and reconciliation with each other, but rather in the portrait it offers of two people filled with lack. Each is gnawed at by absence and each, though peculiar in her sadness, has a youthful, bitter confusion that is likely to speak universally to any reader whose growing up was jagged. </p> <p>Enright is so intelligent and so controlled that she doubtless knows already the risks her style poses. At times her choice of adjectives - particularly when in unexpected combinations - can seem over-deliberate, almost a kind of knowingness. When she describes Maria's farming cousins at table, \"their movements obliged and tragic\", one feels that she has got ahead of her characters - that she is condescending to them a little, sealing them off from the reader in fancy words. </p> <p>The bold confidence of Enright's style, and its tendency to break into tight, perfect paragraphs, can occasionally waver on the border of flippancy. I don't believe her, for instance, when she tells me that Maria's stepmother married her husband because he sleeps so soundly at night: \"It was for this she married him, for his ability to sleep.\" At such moments, Enright wants her characters to seem confident in their own sadness - to be decisive fatalists - yet it seems to be only the author being confident on behalf of her characters. </p> <p>But such fractures are very rare. Much more common - indeed, overwhelmingly, redeemingly common - are moments and whole passages when Enright captures something subterranean with a strange flick of her marvellous insight. Maria's unconfident father, for example, kisses a woman at work, and is unsure: \"He had never kissed the mouth of a woman who smoked . . . it gave him the uncomfortable feeling that he might be kissing a man.\" Or there's Maria's stepmother, trying on dresses in a shop and disliking \"a gathered floral thing that made her look like an alcoholic\". Or this perfect comic devastation of the pretensions of Manhattan sandwiches: \"Genoa salami, mortadella, Black Forest ham, provolone, balsamic vinegar and olive oil. It looked like a dinner party slapped on a slice of bread.\" Maria has to turn to a different, calmer sandwich: \"It was not a sandwich you had to dress up for.\" </p> <p>Elsewhere, a drunk is seen, \"his face working in slow motion, as though every emotion was a puzzle to him, and the solution was a surprise . . .\" And, most beautifully: \"The Shannon has burst its banks and spread like a mirror around Athlone. The fields are full of sky, pierced with grass like frozen, upside-down rain. She sees a swan sailing into the dark mouth of a shed, and the sun comes out at Ballinasloe.\" </p> <p>But another distinctive stylist, Virginia Woolf, argued that writers should be praised not for sentences but for chapters - for the accumulation of their lustres. Anne Enright practises a kind of emotional cubism, using her characters to piece together the world in strange combinations with perfect, sharp little sentences. As a way of constructing a novel, rather than short stories (Jane Bowles and Flannery O' Connor come to mind), it is a risky procedure. But in the end this novel is more than a style; it is a style that turns itself into a world, a world of sad comedy, securely if gradually located in the distressed hearts of Enright's moving heroines, twins whose anxious solitude the reader comes to know and share.</p> <p>\u0095 To order What Are You Like? at the discount price of \u00a38 plus 99p p&amp;p, call the Guardian CultureShop on 0800 3166 102.</p>",

She sees a swan sailing into the dark mouth of a shed, and the sun comes out at Ballinasloe.\" But another distinctive stylist, Virginia Woolf, argued that writers should be praised not for sentences but for chapters - for the accumulation of their lustres. Anne Enright practises a kind of emotional cubism, using her characters to piece together the world in strange combinations with perfect, sharp little sentences. As a way of constructing a novel, rather than short stories (Jane Bowles and Flannery O' Connor come to mind), it is a risky procedure. But in the end this novel is more than a style; it is a style that turns itself into a world, a world of sad comedy, securely if gradually located in the distressed hearts of Enright's moving heroines, twins whose anxious solitude the reader comes to know and share. \u0095 To order What Are You Like? at the discount price of \u00a38 plus 99p p&amp;p, call the Guardian CultureShop on 0800 3166 102.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> Ovid Metamorphosed</strong><br> ed. Philip Terry<br> 250pp, Chatto &amp; Windus, \u00a314.99</p> <p> Ovid was perhaps the greatest of the Roman poets, and his influence on Western literature is unique. While the marks left by other ostensibly more monumental figures from Roman antiquity (Lucretius, Virgil, Horace) have faded into a kind of quiet scholar's obscurity, Ovid's work -which, to his contemporaries, was sexy, funny, graceful and true, but not especially \"serious\" - continues to demonstrate a remarkable imaginative staying power. Now the facts of Ovid's life and the themes of his work are glanced at, toyed with, reinterpreted and sometimes explicitly described in a new collection of essays and short stories edited by Philip Terry, Ovid Metamorphosed . What is the cause of this persistent fascination? </p> <p>Ovid was born shortly after Julius Caesar's assassination, and died before Christ grew to manhood. He was too young fully to appreciate the peace and stability which the emperor Augustus wrested from the war-torn ruins of the old Republic. He made his name not with epic flattery of the vanities of the regime, like Virgil, or graceful, moralising essays, like Horace, but with two notorious poems devoted to seduction and adultery, the Amores and the Ars Amatoria , which preached that sex was the only thing really worth doing and poked malicious fun at the plain-living Roman values of military achievement and chastity within marriage promoted by the emperor. </p> <p>Yet though he lived as a sensualist, he was centred as a poet by his knowledge of what it is like to suffer - to be helplessly, ferociously in the grip of some frustrated or denied emotional need. In the Heroides , a book of imaginary letters from famous heroines to their lovers, he took the monologue out of classical drama and made it lyrical and contemporary, creating a form - the unhappy woman alone, analysing her feelings - which has conditioned literature and art ever since. </p> <p>In his greatest work, the Metamorphoses , he writes of shape- changing and transformation; but the stories he tells are interesting less for their eye-catching fairytale magic - the necromantic element rendered so well by Hughes - than for Ovid's hypnotic understanding of the vulnerability of human emotions. His spirit was vivacious, sceptical, hedonistic, but shot through with pain. He lived when the old certainties were dying but a new era of faith had not yet taken hold, and the stoic darkness of a godless world - one without pity or consolation - always lay threateningly close. </p> <p>Ovid had no literal belief in gods, but he retained a deep respect for the powers which they embodied - for the anarchy and cruelty of lust, the mania of love and the fateful violence which could strike down the arrogant and overweening. Although his enemies disparaged him as a frivolous boudoir cynic, he treated the fickleness of male desire and the wounded extremes of misplaced female trust and hope with a depth of sympathy that has remained \"modern\" for 2,000 years. It was a passion with him - as Chaucer, Dante, Shakespeare and Goethe knew - to get inside the skin, to enter the soul of the victim. </p> <p>He became one himself in the end, sent to live in conditions of near-Siberian harshness in what is now Romania after becoming involved in some scandal involving the Emperor's promiscuous grand-daughter, Julia. The reversal of fortune broke him completely. Like Oscar Wilde centuries later, he was pathetically out of his depth in a world where sophistication meant nothing; and the brutality of exile left him howling with self-pity. </p> <p>Appropriately, the stories in Ovid Metamorphosed jangle with discordance. Sometimes they echo closely the sinuous, erotic violence in Ovid's own writing - MJ Fitzgerald gives us a retelling of the story of Tereus and Philomel in hard, brutal prose which is part translation, part something more immediate - or venture along the inviting pathways of biographical speculation. Paul West's sane and funny \"Nightfall on the Romanian Coast\" sees Ovid looking back, in contemporary language and from the standpoint of our present age, on a life that went wrong for reasons that Meyerhold or Shostakovich might have understood. \"I was a snob,\" says West's Ovid. \"I refused to come up with tractor poems, paeans to hydroelectric stations, to the rustic rabble and the proles of Rome.\" </p> <p>The list of contributors is impressive - Marina Warner, Margaret Atwood, Michele Roberts among them - and few of the stories lack their own particular narrative skills or effects of atmosphere. Yet there's a sense of strain, clutter, ingenuity prevailing over creativity, in much of the writing. The world created here is coldly nightmarish rather than dreamlike, and to a large extent - many of the contributors are women - in revolt against or embarrassed by male values. </p> <p>It is also heavy with psycho- analytical hindsight. Nicole Ward Jouve reconstructs Ovid's Narcissus as a self-regarding academic-cum-artist, interested only in seeing herself reflected in the praise of her acolytes; Joyce Carol Oates turns Actaeon, who was torn apart by hounds, into a drunken patriarchal brute from Nova Scotia who humiliates his wife in public and is then gleefully dismembered by his children; Philip Terry depicts a magazine attracting protest after it starts to print politically incorrect sex tips filched from the Ars Amatoria in its agony column. </p> <p>What these too-metaphorical reinterpretations cannot convey is the wonderful transfiguring romanticism of Ovid's own tale-spinning - the sheer literal beauty of his images. Perhaps this is why the two most impressive pieces in the book - AS Byatt's \"Arachne\" and \"Heart's Wing\" by Gabriel Josipovici - are not stories but essays, distinguished pieces of imaginative criticism which successfully express the vital resonance at the heart of Ovid's masterpiece, the idea that human feelings can be so strong, so intense, that the laws of nature bend beneath them. </p> <p>Josipovici's \"Heart's Wing\" is a meditation upon Ovid's tale of Alcyone, who was so wracked with grief at the death of her husband in a shipwreck that the gods turned them both into kingfishers. It is also an elegy to his mother, the translator Sacha Rabinovitch, and an attempt to understand why the story had meant so much to her. Simply and eloquently, he traces this back to lived experience: \"Her husband's abandonment of her, pregnant and with a two-month-old child . . . and the subsequent death of her second child . . . must have convinced her at some inarticulate level that nothing she loved could be held for long.\" He surmises that, in Ovid's tale, \"she found her pain renewed and at the same time made bearable\". </p> <p>Freud thought that the process of mourning had not been com pleted until whatever had been lost was restored to life within the heart or the ego of the mourner. This weaved-up mystery lies at the heart of the Metamorphoses and helps to explain its extraordinary continuing appeal. Unlike Ted Hughes, I don't believe Ovid's tales are about the supernatural, or at least not in any sense that matters. The transformations are metaphors - beautiful, resonant, pain-resolving - like the stage miracle of Hermione's resurrection at the end of Shakespeare's Winter's Tale , or the last-minute off-stage divine redemption of Gretchen in Goethe's Faust . </p> <p>There is also a voice in Ovid's work that prose cannot capture, but which was caught, clearly and gracefully, by the poet Jamie McKendrick in a passage from the anthology After Ovid . It's a contemporary voice, but also very ancient, the voice not only of Ovid's Polyphemus but of Shakespeare's Caliban and of song itself, eternally yearning, eternally unfulfilled: </p> <p> \"I'd dig rare gems out of the mountainside </p> <p>With strange faults of fire like constellations </p> <p>And fashion a necklace of dragonflies </p> <p>And teach two tame owls to sing for you . . .\"</p> <p><strong>Ovid's many metamorphoses</strong></p> <p><strong>Tales From Ovid, by Ted Hughes (Faber, \u00a38.99)</strong> </p> <p>Hughes's dark, incandescent and eminently page-turnable Tales From Ovid was one of the publishing successes of 1997. </p> <p><strong> After Ovid, ed. Michael Hoffman (Faber, \u00a38.99)</strong> </p> <p>Hughes's interest grew from this earlier, more experimental volume, in which many different poets - the best-known being Hughes and Heaney - tried their hands at individual sections of the Metamorphoses . </p> <p><strong> An Imaginary Life, by David Malouf (Vintage, \u00a36.99)</strong> </p> <p>A fable of spiritual rebirth, constructed from the circumstances of Ovid's banishment to the shores of the Black Sea, and written with severity and grace. </p> <p><strong> Metamorphoses, ed.

Paul West's sane and funny \"Nightfall on the Romanian Coast\" sees Ovid looking back, in contemporary language and from the standpoint of our present age, on a life that went wrong for reasons that Meyerhold or Shostakovich might have understood. \"I was a snob,\" says West's Ovid. \"I refused to come up with tractor poems, paeans to hydroelectric stations, to the rustic rabble and the proles of Rome.\" The list of contributors is impressive - Marina Warner, Margaret Atwood, Michele Roberts among them - and few of the stories lack their own particular narrative skills or effects of atmosphere. Yet there's a sense of strain, clutter, ingenuity prevailing over creativity, in much of the writing. The world created here is coldly nightmarish rather than dreamlike, and to a large extent - many of the contributors are women - in revolt against or embarrassed by male values. It is also heavy with psycho- analytical hindsight. Nicole Ward Jouve reconstructs Ovid's Narcissus as a self-regarding academic-cum-artist, interested only in seeing herself reflected in the praise of her acolytes; Joyce Carol Oates turns Actaeon, who was torn apart by hounds, into a drunken patriarchal brute from Nova Scotia who humiliates his wife in public and is then gleefully dismembered by his children; Philip Terry depicts a magazine attracting protest after it starts to print politically incorrect sex tips filched from the Ars Amatoria in its agony column. What these too-metaphorical reinterpretations cannot convey is the wonderful transfiguring romanticism of Ovid's own tale-spinning - the sheer literal beauty of his images. Perhaps this is why the two most impressive pieces in the book - AS Byatt's \"Arachne\" and \"Heart's Wing\" by Gabriel Josipovici - are not stories but essays, distinguished pieces of imaginative criticism which successfully express the vital resonance at the heart of Ovid's masterpiece, the idea that human feelings can be so strong, so intense, that the laws of nature bend beneath them. Josipovici's \"Heart's Wing\" is a meditation upon Ovid's tale of Alcyone, who was so wracked with grief at the death of her husband in a shipwreck that the gods turned them both into kingfishers. It is also an elegy to his mother, the translator Sacha Rabinovitch, and an attempt to understand why the story had meant so much to her. Simply and eloquently, he traces this back to lived experience: \"Her husband's abandonment of her, pregnant and with a two-month-old child . . . and the subsequent death of her second child . . . must have convinced her at some inarticulate level that nothing she loved could be held for long.\" He surmises that, in Ovid's tale, \"she found her pain renewed and at the same time made bearable\". Freud thought that the process of mourning had not been com pleted until whatever had been lost was restored to life within the heart or the ego of the mourner. This weaved-up mystery lies at the heart of the Metamorphoses and helps to explain its extraordinary continuing appeal. Unlike Ted Hughes, I don't believe Ovid's tales are about the supernatural, or at least not in any sense that matters. The transformations are metaphors - beautiful, resonant, pain-resolving - like the stage miracle of Hermione's resurrection at the end of Shakespeare's Winter's Tale , or the last-minute off-stage divine redemption of Gretchen in Goethe's Faust . There is also a voice in Ovid's work that prose cannot capture, but which was caught, clearly and gracefully, by the poet Jamie McKendrick in a passage from the anthology After Ovid . It's a contemporary voice, but also very ancient, the voice not only of Ovid's Polyphemus but of Shakespeare's Caliban and of song itself, eternally yearning, eternally unfulfilled: \"I'd dig rare gems out of the mountainside With strange faults of fire like constellations And fashion a necklace of dragonflies And teach two tame owls to sing for you . . .\" Ovid's many metamorphoses Tales From Ovid, by Ted Hughes (Faber, \u00a38.99) Hughes's dark, incandescent and eminently page-turnable Tales From Ovid was one of the publishing successes of 1997. After Ovid, ed. Michael Hoffman (Faber, \u00a38.99) Hughes's interest grew from this earlier, more experimental volume, in which many different poets - the best-known being Hughes and Heaney - tried their hands at individual sections of the Metamorphoses . An Imaginary Life, by David Malouf (Vintage, \u00a36.99) A fable of spiritual rebirth, constructed from the circumstances of Ovid's banishment to the shores of the Black Sea, and written with severity and grace. Metamorphoses, ed. EJ Kenney (Oxford, \u00a37.99) Modern, unacademic translation.",

Mr Ayling's bitter business rival, Sir Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic, who clashed with BA over its \"dirty tricks\" campaign, wished him \"the best of luck\".",

One way to avoid that problem is to take a \"discount plus cap\" loan, which limits the maximum rate that you will pay on the mortgage.

Understandably these have not been popular in recent months as rates have risen and are expected to go higher.

What does is the set (it's the mall but it also looks like those bridges over busy roads, always home to bored adolescents), the music, the writing (David Greig, yet again) and the timeless observations that still feel just like now. \"You hate us because we're different; we hate you because you're all the same.\" Teenage kicks in this instance, but true to Voltaire, too. That takes some doing. \u0095 Ends tonight, then touring to Newcastle, Aberdeen, Inverness and Edinburgh; tour details: 0141-248 8052.",

      "body": "<p>The growth of the internet means the small private investor now has access to a wealth of information and tools that, up until a few years ago, were strictly the preserve of the professionals. </p> <p>Not only has the net forced sharedealing costs down - it also means the world is your oyster. You can research companies in Seattle, Stuttgart or anywhere in between, find out how stock markets across the globe are performing and call up the latest investment news all at the click of a mouse. </p> <p>The internet has also made it much easier to monitor how your shares and other investments are doing. </p> <p>But the sheer volume of material in cyberspace can produce that \"I don't know where to start\" feeling. That's where personal finance sites such as MoneyWorld (<a href=\"http://www.moneyworld.co.uk\">www.moneyworld.co.uk</a>), Interactive Investor International (<a href=\"http://www.iii.co.uk\">www.iii.co.uk</a>) and the Guardian's moneyUnlimited (<a href=\"http://www.moneyunlimited.co.uk\">www.moneyunlimited.co.uk</a>) come in. </p> <p>These three, and a number of other sites, all offer \"portfolio management services\", which let you track the performance of a whole range of investments, from shares and products such as personal equity plans and individual savings accounts, to pensions and offshore funds. </p> <p>With most of the sites, the service is free. You can have as many or as few investments in your portfolio as you like, and amend it as you wish. You can view the latest share prices, call up historical performance data, and measure the performance of your imvestments against the various indices, and display this in graph form. You can even set up some systems to notify you when a share you are interested in hits a certain price. </p> <p>If you're wondering what's in it for the websites, the answer is that these services are a very good way of getting people to come back time and time again, explains John Blowers at Interactive Investor International.

      "bodyText": "The growth of the internet means the small private investor now has access to a wealth of information and tools that, up until a few years ago, were strictly the preserve of the professionals. Not only has the net forced sharedealing costs down - it also means the world is your oyster. You can research companies in Seattle, Stuttgart or anywhere in between, find out how stock markets across the globe are performing and call up the latest investment news all at the click of a mouse. The internet has also made it much easier to monitor how your shares and other investments are doing. But the sheer volume of material in cyberspace can produce that \"I don't know where to start\" feeling. That's where personal finance sites such as MoneyWorld (www.moneyworld.co.uk), Interactive Investor International (www.iii.co.uk) and the Guardian's moneyUnlimited (www.moneyunlimited.co.uk) come in. These three, and a number of other sites, all offer \"portfolio management services\", which let you track the performance of a whole range of investments, from shares and products such as personal equity plans and individual savings accounts, to pensions and offshore funds. With most of the sites, the service is free. You can have as many or as few investments in your portfolio as you like, and amend it as you wish. You can view the latest share prices, call up historical performance data, and measure the performance of your imvestments against the various indices, and display this in graph form. You can even set up some systems to notify you when a share you are interested in hits a certain price. If you're wondering what's in it for the websites, the answer is that these services are a very good way of getting people to come back time and time again, explains John Blowers at Interactive Investor International. They are all desperate to build up user loyalty - the more page views they get and the higher the number of regular users, the more they can charge advertisers. \"There's a battle of the portfolio tracking services going on out there,\" says Danny Bowers, editor of MoneyWorld.

      "body": "<p>Sir Peter Davis, the new chief executive of Sainsbury, sacked two of his key deputies yesterday in a move that could cost the supermarket group up to \u00a31.5m in payoffs. </p> <p>Sir Peter, who moved into Sainsbury only eight days ago, asked David Bremner, managing director of the ailing chain, and stores director Kevin McCarten to leave with immediate effect. </p> <p>The City welcomed the decisive action and the shares climbed 21p, or 8.79%, to 260p, adding some \u00a3410m to the value of the group. </p> <p>Sir Peter paid tribute to the two men - but pledged to fight any claims they might make for two year's money as compensation for loss of office. </p> <p>The directors are in the middle of converting from two- year to one-year contracts, but the procedure had not been completed when Sir Peter made his move. Mr Bremner, 41, who has spent 15 years of his career with the Sainsbury group, could therefore be entitled to a payoff of up to \u00a3850,000 - twice his 1999 salary. Mr McCarten, also aged 41, earned \u00a3294,000 last year and could qualify for a \u00a3588,000 payout. </p> <p>Yesterday Sir Peter said negotiations with the two men over their payoffs were under way but that he would seek to reduce their payoffs on the grounds that they were both likely to land new jobs quickly. \"They are both exceedingly bright and young. We will argue very hard for mitigation on a two-year basis\". </p> <p>The management shake-up means that three of Sainsbury's top directors have been removed since the turn of the year. Chief executive Dino Adriano was asked to leave in January to make way for Sir Peter Davis. </p> <p>The new chief executive, who was formerly at the Pru, was widely welcomed by investors and analysts. He had spent 10 years at Sainsbury between 1976 and 1986 and at the Pru he was credited with hauling the insurer back from the abyss of pensions misselling and masterminding the development of the much-admired Egg internet bank. </p> <p>Yesterday Sir Peter, who is in line to earn \u00a312m by 2003 if he can turn the struggling com pany around, said he did not envisage any other top level sackings but that he wanted to appoint a senior executive \"to give a lot more attention\" to Sainsbury's internet expansion. </p> <p>The group, which has been suffering from under-investment in its stores and plummeting sales and profits, is lagging well behind rival Tesco on the high street and with its e-commerce plans. At the same time Asda, now owned by US group Wal-Mart, is threatening to steal its number two position in the UK grocery market. </p> <p>The new chief executive said Sainsbury was in need of strong leadership and promised to unveil his strategy to turn around the store's fading fortunes at the end of May. He added that he had just bet on his chances by buying \u00a3250,000 of Sainsbury shares. </p> <p>He said that he wanted to take hands-on control of the business. \"It is clear to me that if I am to bring about the scale and pace of change that I believe is necessary, then it requires me to take active day-to-day control of the business.\" </p> <p>He added that his decision to dismiss Mr Bremner was \"not a change of direction, just a change of driver\". He quipped: \"Maybe he should go for the British Airways job\". </p> <p>Mr McCarten was appointed marketing director of Sainsbury in 1995, but was recently shunted sideways to become stores director. Sir Peter said: \"I would not have appointed him stores director. He has many skills and is very bright, but I want someone with retail experience\". </p> <p>He has handed the job of retail director, effectively a role as his deputy, to the little-known buying director, Robin Whitbread.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sir Peter Davis, the new chief executive of Sainsbury, sacked two of his key deputies yesterday in a move that could cost the supermarket group up to \u00a31.5m in payoffs. Sir Peter, who moved into Sainsbury only eight days ago, asked David Bremner, managing director of the ailing chain, and stores director Kevin McCarten to leave with immediate effect. The City welcomed the decisive action and the shares climbed 21p, or 8.79%, to 260p, adding some \u00a3410m to the value of the group. Sir Peter paid tribute to the two men - but pledged to fight any claims they might make for two year's money as compensation for loss of office. The directors are in the middle of converting from two- year to one-year contracts, but the procedure had not been completed when Sir Peter made his move. Mr Bremner, 41, who has spent 15 years of his career with the Sainsbury group, could therefore be entitled to a payoff of up to \u00a3850,000 - twice his 1999 salary. Mr McCarten, also aged 41, earned \u00a3294,000 last year and could qualify for a \u00a3588,000 payout. Yesterday Sir Peter said negotiations with the two men over their payoffs were under way but that he would seek to reduce their payoffs on the grounds that they were both likely to land new jobs quickly. \"They are both exceedingly bright and young. We will argue very hard for mitigation on a two-year basis\". The management shake-up means that three of Sainsbury's top directors have been removed since the turn of the year. Chief executive Dino Adriano was asked to leave in January to make way for Sir Peter Davis. The new chief executive, who was formerly at the Pru, was widely welcomed by investors and analysts. He had spent 10 years at Sainsbury between 1976 and 1986 and at the Pru he was credited with hauling the insurer back from the abyss of pensions misselling and masterminding the development of the much-admired Egg internet bank. Yesterday Sir Peter, who is in line to earn \u00a312m by 2003 if he can turn the struggling com pany around, said he did not envisage any other top level sackings but that he wanted to appoint a senior executive \"to give a lot more attention\" to Sainsbury's internet expansion. The group, which has been suffering from under-investment in its stores and plummeting sales and profits, is lagging well behind rival Tesco on the high street and with its e-commerce plans. At the same time Asda, now owned by US group Wal-Mart, is threatening to steal its number two position in the UK grocery market. The new chief executive said Sainsbury was in need of strong leadership and promised to unveil his strategy to turn around the store's fading fortunes at the end of May. He added that he had just bet on his chances by buying \u00a3250,000 of Sainsbury shares. He said that he wanted to take hands-on control of the business. \"It is clear to me that if I am to bring about the scale and pace of change that I believe is necessary, then it requires me to take active day-to-day control of the business.\" He added that his decision to dismiss Mr Bremner was \"not a change of direction, just a change of driver\". He quipped: \"Maybe he should go for the British Airways job\". Mr McCarten was appointed marketing director of Sainsbury in 1995, but was recently shunted sideways to become stores director. Sir Peter said: \"I would not have appointed him stores director. He has many skills and is very bright, but I want someone with retail experience\". He has handed the job of retail director, effectively a role as his deputy, to the little-known buying director, Robin Whitbread.",

      "body": "<p>It's make up your mind time for millions holding shares in Norwich Union and for members of the Skipton and Chelsea building societies. At stake is the future of these financial companies. </p> <p>Norwich Union shareholders are being asked to vote their company into a merger with rival CGU to create the tongue-twisting CGNU, while savers and borrowers of the two building societies have to decide whether to continue backing their boards' pro-mutuality stances. </p> <p>Even though the boards of all three organisations are pushing their own lines, all could receive a nasty jolt from rebel shareholders and members. </p> <p>Norwich Union shareholders are being sent more than 300 pages of documentation. It details how they will receive 48 new CGNU shares for every 100 Norwich Union shares now held and how NU investors will collectively own 41.5% of the new company. </p> <p>But nowhere is there any space devoted to those who might wish to vote against the marriage. All the reasoning is positive. Nor is there anything to help the many shareholders who are with-profits policy owners. </p> <p>John Piaseycki, from Berkshire, says he is far more concerned about his endowment than his shares. \"My policy is worth many times more. But there's no guidance as to how the merger will affect the with-profits fund other than saying shareholders could get their hands on some of the money. They don't seem to care about us as customers.\" </p> <p>Norwich Union admits it is in a \"Catch 22\" position. It says it cannot legally answer with-profits queries until the merger is completed although it is aware that many regard these as central to deciding on the deal. </p> <p>There is a voting slip should investors wish to disagree with the proposed \u00a320bn union. Ballots must be returned by March 29 - unless shareholders turn up at the Wembley Conference Centre meeting on March 31. </p> <p>Shareholders are being persuaded to vote in favour of the merger - technically a takeover by the larger CGU - with the carrots of a 30% higher dividend, cost savings of up to \u00a3250m a year (largely financed through redundancies), enhanced net asset value per share and an \"improved strategic position\". </p> <p>And the merged group will have size - toppling the Prudential as Britain's biggest insurer and become a top five company in its sector in Europe. It will also have \u00a3200bn of assets under management with worldwide premium income and investment product sales topping \u00a326bn. </p> <p>One reason for voting against is the hope that another bidder will join the fray. For the merger presents no immediate takeover premium for stock holders in Norwich Union, which was demutualised in 1997. They are swapping their shares for no gain. </p> <p>City analysts originally hoped for a counterbid from the likes of the French Axa, the German Allianz, the Dutch Aegon and the Italian Generali. But none of these European giants has shown the slightest interest so far. </p> <p>The result is that all the big Norwich Union shareholders have lost interest and will vote in favour unless there is an eleventh hour change of mind. The Norwich Union share price which hit 500p last year, and stood at 460p after the deal was announced, has now slumped back to 400p indicating little chance of a hostile bid. And that's just 75p ahead of its first day's trading in June 1997. </p> <p>But small investors, including disgruntled Norwich Union staff, who want to express displeasure at the way their company has been signed, sealed and delivered can still register a protest by voting against. </p> <p>One angry Norwich Union shareholder, who posted a message on the Hemscott.Net bulletin board under, called the merger \"rank bad value\" and added: \"There's no obvious benefit for shareholders and Norwich Union is not getting a great deal out of this merger.\" </p> <p>The first hurdle for Norwich Union is to win acceptances from holders of 50.01% of shares - otherwise the deal falls. Individuals hold around 40% of the Norwich Union share base - mostly in small parcels averaging 300 shares currently worth about \u00a31,200. </p> <p>Were 25% to vote against, the group would be unable to pass certain resolutions at the extraordinary general meeting it has called. And if holders of more than 10% of the capital - one in four of the individual 1.2m shareholders - either vote against or abstain, Norwich Union will be unable to acquire outstanding shares compulsorily, although it will effectively be controlled by CGU. </p> <p>Even if it gave up its official stock market quote, there could still be an unofficial market in the shares which would cause embarrassment to the combined CGNU board. </p> <p>The two building societies are hoping to turn the tables on carpetbaggers by incorporating their resolutions. Members looking for a windfall are now suggesting voting against whatever the board recommends to register disapproval. </p> <p>The Chelsea voting pack is being sent to members over the next two weeks. </p> <p>This could produce bizarre results with carpetbaggers saying no to the first Chelsea resolution which invites the board to \"consider the option of takeover or conversion.\" Chelsea says members should support this as it claims it does this every year as part of its essential planning. </p> <p>The second supports the establishment of a charity to receive windfalls - again in line with Chelsea board thinking but one that will not be favoured by demutualisation supporters. </p> <p>Chelsea ballots have to be returned by April 22 - unless members turn up at the annual meeting in Cheltenham on April 27. </p> <p>The Skipton is fighting off its carpetbaggers with exactly the same tactics and with similarly-worded resolutions. Again, it expects members to vote for \"considering changing the independent mutual status of the society\" although it would not matter if they voted against. </p> <p>The Skipton meeting is to be held in Skipton on April 26 - postal votes must arrive by April 20 while branch ballot boxes stay open until April 18. </p> <p>The Portman pushed demutualisation off its agenda by throwing out members who supported a windfall resolution. Now savers and depositors who support a status change are being urged on the Carpetbagger.com site to vote against the re-election of directors. </p>",

But nowhere is there any space devoted to those who might wish to vote against the marriage. All the reasoning is positive. Nor is there anything to help the many shareholders who are with-profits policy owners. John Piaseycki, from Berkshire, says he is far more concerned about his endowment than his shares. \"My policy is worth many times more. But there's no guidance as to how the merger will affect the with-profits fund other than saying shareholders could get their hands on some of the money. They don't seem to care about us as customers.\" Norwich Union admits it is in a \"Catch 22\" position. It says it cannot legally answer with-profits queries until the merger is completed although it is aware that many regard these as central to deciding on the deal. There is a voting slip should investors wish to disagree with the proposed \u00a320bn union. Ballots must be returned by March 29 - unless shareholders turn up at the Wembley Conference Centre meeting on March 31. Shareholders are being persuaded to vote in favour of the merger - technically a takeover by the larger CGU - with the carrots of a 30% higher dividend, cost savings of up to \u00a3250m a year (largely financed through redundancies), enhanced net asset value per share and an \"improved strategic position\". And the merged group will have size - toppling the Prudential as Britain's biggest insurer and become a top five company in its sector in Europe. It will also have \u00a3200bn of assets under management with worldwide premium income and investment product sales topping \u00a326bn. One reason for voting against is the hope that another bidder will join the fray. For the merger presents no immediate takeover premium for stock holders in Norwich Union, which was demutualised in 1997. They are swapping their shares for no gain. City analysts originally hoped for a counterbid from the likes of the French Axa, the German Allianz, the Dutch Aegon and the Italian Generali. But none of these European giants has shown the slightest interest so far. The result is that all the big Norwich Union shareholders have lost interest and will vote in favour unless there is an eleventh hour change of mind. The Norwich Union share price which hit 500p last year, and stood at 460p after the deal was announced, has now slumped back to 400p indicating little chance of a hostile bid. And that's just 75p ahead of its first day's trading in June 1997. But small investors, including disgruntled Norwich Union staff, who want to express displeasure at the way their company has been signed, sealed and delivered can still register a protest by voting against. One angry Norwich Union shareholder, who posted a message on the Hemscott.Net bulletin board under, called the merger \"rank bad value\" and added: \"There's no obvious benefit for shareholders and Norwich Union is not getting a great deal out of this merger.\" The first hurdle for Norwich Union is to win acceptances from holders of 50.01% of shares - otherwise the deal falls. Individuals hold around 40% of the Norwich Union share base - mostly in small parcels averaging 300 shares currently worth about \u00a31,200. Were 25% to vote against, the group would be unable to pass certain resolutions at the extraordinary general meeting it has called. And if holders of more than 10% of the capital - one in four of the individual 1.2m shareholders - either vote against or abstain, Norwich Union will be unable to acquire outstanding shares compulsorily, although it will effectively be controlled by CGU. Even if it gave up its official stock market quote, there could still be an unofficial market in the shares which would cause embarrassment to the combined CGNU board. The two building societies are hoping to turn the tables on carpetbaggers by incorporating their resolutions. Members looking for a windfall are now suggesting voting against whatever the board recommends to register disapproval. The Chelsea voting pack is being sent to members over the next two weeks. This could produce bizarre results with carpetbaggers saying no to the first Chelsea resolution which invites the board to \"consider the option of takeover or conversion.\" Chelsea says members should support this as it claims it does this every year as part of its essential planning. The second supports the establishment of a charity to receive windfalls - again in line with Chelsea board thinking but one that will not be favoured by demutualisation supporters. Chelsea ballots have to be returned by April 22 - unless members turn up at the annual meeting in Cheltenham on April 27. The Skipton is fighting off its carpetbaggers with exactly the same tactics and with similarly-worded resolutions. Again, it expects members to vote for \"considering changing the independent mutual status of the society\" although it would not matter if they voted against. The Skipton meeting is to be held in Skipton on April 26 - postal votes must arrive by April 20 while branch ballot boxes stay open until April 18. The Portman pushed demutualisation off its agenda by throwing out members who supported a windfall resolution. Now savers and depositors who support a status change are being urged on the Carpetbagger.com site to vote against the re-election of directors.",
