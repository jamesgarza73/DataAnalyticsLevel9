Works by Kaija Saariaho and Per Norgard took a different approach, luxuriating in the textures of particular instrumental combinations. Saariaho's Oi Kuu fused a bass clarinet and cello together, creating a virtual instrument in the intersection between the bass clarinet's breathiness and the cello's half-formed bow-strokes. Norgard's Lark Song was a playful meditation on a simple, tonal melody for flute, violin and cello. </p> <p>Andrew Hamilton's soprano + horn =, a first performance, cut up a text by Jasper Johns and set it to a similarly scarified music of rhythmic insistence. Music by Oliver Knussen and Harrison Birtwistle framed the concert - Knussen's expressive, keening settings of poems by Rilke for solo soprano, and Birtwistle's Monody, for soprano and ensemble. At around 10 minutes long, this piece sounded extravagantly large-scale in comparison with the rest of the concert. </p> <p>A late-night recital of solo works for violin and viola continued the Hoxton New Music Days' Bach and Today series, with three works of enormous difficulty and ambition. Robin Holloway's solo viola sonata, another world premiere, defined an idiomatic world of melancholy invention that Paul Silverthorne communicated with conviction. David Le Page's performances of Bach and Luciano Berio were impressive feats of stamina and technique.

      "byline": "Dr Sandi Mann",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The problem</p> <p>I have worked in a small manufacturing company for only 4 weeks. I am 28 years old. The job is relaxed, the pay is not fabulous but I cannot complain. The problem is that the team is divided in two groups, and I have to work with both teams. </p> <p>One team leader keeps himself top dog with a ruthless use of company gossip. He is aggressive but he had done it like that for the past 25 years. Luckily the other is quite the opposite but the problem is that I am caught in the middle. Gossip has started already so I really need to know how to handle my co-workers?</p> <p><strong>The solution</strong></p> <p>OK, you need to tread quite carefully since you have only been with the company for four weeks. You are not in any position to make waves by confronting the Bad Guy leader. All you can do is protect your back and try and get in with both teams.</p> <p>I suggest that you take three tacks in your attempts to stay in with everyone. The first involves ingratiating yourself with Mr Bad Guy, the second concerns coping with the gossip, whilst the third tack involves getting on with your co-workers. I'll go through each in turn:</p> <p>Dealing with Mr Bad Guy: Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but you are going to have to suck up to this guy a bit. Not too much - but just enough to encourage him to cut the gossip a bit. Forget his numerous character flaws, and try to find something to relate to with him. Talk to him, agree with him (not all the time!), flatter him occasionally, do favours for him - anything to get him on your side. But, don't overdo it since he will probably twig what your game is whilst really cheesing off your co-workers.</p> <p>Coping with the gossip: There are several approaches to countering gossip that depend on what is being said. One way is to spread rumours about yourself that contradict the gossip. Another is to deny it. A third approach is to simply ignore it. But, the best approach in your case could be to tackle the source of the gossip-mongering - Mr Bad Guy - and tell him how the rumours are getting you down. If you have followed</p> <p>Step 1 and won him over a little, he may be more inclined to stop.</p> <p>Getting on with co-workers: Your final strategy involves you being everyone's buddy. Harder said than done, but you really need to cultivate an image of being a likeable, harmless chap/chapess who fits in with both camps.

      "bodyText": "The problem I have worked in a small manufacturing company for only 4 weeks. I am 28 years old. The job is relaxed, the pay is not fabulous but I cannot complain. The problem is that the team is divided in two groups, and I have to work with both teams. One team leader keeps himself top dog with a ruthless use of company gossip. He is aggressive but he had done it like that for the past 25 years. Luckily the other is quite the opposite but the problem is that I am caught in the middle. Gossip has started already so I really need to know how to handle my co-workers? The solution OK, you need to tread quite carefully since you have only been with the company for four weeks. You are not in any position to make waves by confronting the Bad Guy leader. All you can do is protect your back and try and get in with both teams. I suggest that you take three tacks in your attempts to stay in with everyone. The first involves ingratiating yourself with Mr Bad Guy, the second concerns coping with the gossip, whilst the third tack involves getting on with your co-workers. I'll go through each in turn: Dealing with Mr Bad Guy: Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but you are going to have to suck up to this guy a bit. Not too much - but just enough to encourage him to cut the gossip a bit. Forget his numerous character flaws, and try to find something to relate to with him. Talk to him, agree with him (not all the time!), flatter him occasionally, do favours for him - anything to get him on your side. But, don't overdo it since he will probably twig what your game is whilst really cheesing off your co-workers. Coping with the gossip: There are several approaches to countering gossip that depend on what is being said. One way is to spread rumours about yourself that contradict the gossip. Another is to deny it. A third approach is to simply ignore it. But, the best approach in your case could be to tackle the source of the gossip-mongering - Mr Bad Guy - and tell him how the rumours are getting you down. If you have followed Step 1 and won him over a little, he may be more inclined to stop. Getting on with co-workers: Your final strategy involves you being everyone's buddy. Harder said than done, but you really need to cultivate an image of being a likeable, harmless chap/chapess who fits in with both camps. Try and socialise with both teams where possible, but avoid any gossip about the opposing team. Resist being drawn into the us and them competition by making non-committal remarks. What you are hoping to achieve is hard, but, with some tact and diplomacy, you might achieve it. Of course, if you do succeed, you might then wish to consider a career change to the diplomatic service!

      "bodyText": "Cordiant Communications, the advertising agency, is moving into branding and corporate communications with a \u00a3392m takeover of the American Lighthouse Global Network. The all-share deal reflects Cordiant's strategy of building a one-stop shop for all its clients' promotional and marketing needs. It also furthers the group's ambition to build a big presence on both sides of the Atlantic. Cordiant's chief executive, Michael Bungey, said: \"Lighthouse has some extremely good businesses - they're fast growing and they have high margins. We were essentially an advertising agency with some services on the side. Now we really are truly a marketing and communications group.\" Lighthouse's businesses include the London public relations firm Financial Dynamics, which handles communications in the City for a number of leading companies - including Glaxo Wellcome, Kingfisher, Tesco and Cadbury Schweppes.

Cordiant, which owns the Bates Worldwide advertising network, has been anxious to expand since its creation through a demerger from Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in 1997.

      "byline": "Peter Hetherington",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>A new political force is emerging in town and county halls. It's called municipal Conservatism. Away from Westminster, a party once dedicated to squeezing the life-blood from local government has, in effect, turned full circle to become the champion of local democracy and defender of community action. Some progressive Tory counties, such as Kent, have even been labelled more New Labour than the party in power, with their commitment to the theme of tackling the causes and effects of social problems, from poverty to drug abuse. </p> <p>Last week's annual conference in Bournemouth of the Local Government Association (LGA) was notable not for Labour ministers' set-piece contributions, but the emergence of Tories as social innovators as well as managers who have long believed that the much-vaunted party of business can run things better than Labour or the Lib-Dems. </p> <p>With Tories controlling much of south-east England once again, along with familiar shires and big councils from Bradford to Plymouth, the party has now gained key positions within the LGA. It even chairs the key Improvement and Development Agency, a local authority-led self-policing body which is having some success with a special \"councillors' academy\", while improving town hall efficiency by sending in trouble-shooting squads to sort out collapsing boroughs like Hackney. </p> <p>Sandy Bruce-Lockhart, a fruit farmer who leads Kent county council, is widely admired across the political spectrum for his pragmatic brand of Toryism. \"I'm a strong believer in tackling the root cause of social problems through preventative work and not just by treating the effects,\" he says. \"But I also feel very strongly about traditional Christian values. I do not know how you balance that between left and right. I would not put a label on it.\" </p> <p>His five-year plan, produced after the Tories regained Kent three years ago, speaks of enhancing the quality of life for all residents and improving the accessibility, cost- effectiveness and quality of services while protecting the environment and building up the economy. This has meant not only pushing forward the vast Thames Gateway regeneration project - houses, new businesses and all - east from Dartford but also, at a more parochial level, restoring library opening hours and developing libraries as access centres for learning and business support. </p> <p>In the old royal county of Berkshire, Paul Bettison, leader of Bracknell Forest district, a new unitary authority, is well on the way to making his council the first electronic borough. </p> <p>Bettison, who will shortly become the LGA's housing spokesman, is a man in a hurry. He speaks of municipal Tories having a \"degree of pragmatism which might not always have been there\". His council will shortly give every resident the country's first \"multi-application\" smart card, which will provide access to swimming pools, libraries and many council services - while acting as a school attendance record for children and providing school meals payments through a \"charge it up\" facility. Soon this will be incorporated into a special, free mobile phone. </p> <p>He is also planning to give every child a computer at school, as well as at home. \"I am fairly middle of the road,\" he insists. \"I believe in giving people the freedom to succeed . . . but you also have to give people freedom to fail. They need a safety net.\" </p> <p>Conservatives, in short, are relishing their new-found commitment to local democracy. Lord (Paul) Hanningfield, leader of Essex county council, who heads the Tories on the LGA, says he is prepared to take party leader William Hague on his word that a future Tory government will hand back powers to town and county halls, giving them the freedom to set budgets without Whitehall interference. </p> <p>Others, however, are not so sure. Will the Treasury, under whatever government, tolerate town halls having financial independence, free of the capping threat? </p> <p>But Hanningfield is insistent. \"Although the shadow Treasury team weren't so keen, we will not go back. I have that promise.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "A new political force is emerging in town and county halls. It's called municipal Conservatism. Away from Westminster, a party once dedicated to squeezing the life-blood from local government has, in effect, turned full circle to become the champion of local democracy and defender of community action. Some progressive Tory counties, such as Kent, have even been labelled more New Labour than the party in power, with their commitment to the theme of tackling the causes and effects of social problems, from poverty to drug abuse. Last week's annual conference in Bournemouth of the Local Government Association (LGA) was notable not for Labour ministers' set-piece contributions, but the emergence of Tories as social innovators as well as managers who have long believed that the much-vaunted party of business can run things better than Labour or the Lib-Dems. With Tories controlling much of south-east England once again, along with familiar shires and big councils from Bradford to Plymouth, the party has now gained key positions within the LGA. It even chairs the key Improvement and Development Agency, a local authority-led self-policing body which is having some success with a special \"councillors' academy\", while improving town hall efficiency by sending in trouble-shooting squads to sort out collapsing boroughs like Hackney. Sandy Bruce-Lockhart, a fruit farmer who leads Kent county council, is widely admired across the political spectrum for his pragmatic brand of Toryism. \"I'm a strong believer in tackling the root cause of social problems through preventative work and not just by treating the effects,\" he says. \"But I also feel very strongly about traditional Christian values. I do not know how you balance that between left and right. I would not put a label on it.\" His five-year plan, produced after the Tories regained Kent three years ago, speaks of enhancing the quality of life for all residents and improving the accessibility, cost- effectiveness and quality of services while protecting the environment and building up the economy. This has meant not only pushing forward the vast Thames Gateway regeneration project - houses, new businesses and all - east from Dartford but also, at a more parochial level, restoring library opening hours and developing libraries as access centres for learning and business support. In the old royal county of Berkshire, Paul Bettison, leader of Bracknell Forest district, a new unitary authority, is well on the way to making his council the first electronic borough. Bettison, who will shortly become the LGA's housing spokesman, is a man in a hurry. He speaks of municipal Tories having a \"degree of pragmatism which might not always have been there\". His council will shortly give every resident the country's first \"multi-application\" smart card, which will provide access to swimming pools, libraries and many council services - while acting as a school attendance record for children and providing school meals payments through a \"charge it up\" facility. Soon this will be incorporated into a special, free mobile phone. He is also planning to give every child a computer at school, as well as at home. \"I am fairly middle of the road,\" he insists. \"I believe in giving people the freedom to succeed . . . but you also have to give people freedom to fail. They need a safety net.\" Conservatives, in short, are relishing their new-found commitment to local democracy. Lord (Paul) Hanningfield, leader of Essex county council, who heads the Tories on the LGA, says he is prepared to take party leader William Hague on his word that a future Tory government will hand back powers to town and county halls, giving them the freedom to set budgets without Whitehall interference. Others, however, are not so sure. Will the Treasury, under whatever government, tolerate town halls having financial independence, free of the capping threat? But Hanningfield is insistent. \"Although the shadow Treasury team weren't so keen, we will not go back. I have that promise.\"",

Richard Harrod, a councillor and leader of housing services, insists that the authority will monitor how well the new operator - New Horizons, a partnership between developer Wimpey and the Metropolitan Housing Trust - fulfills its duties. </p> <p>The estate was built for 1,400 families, but about 700 have been decanted to other estates. Density will be much lower on the slimline Chalkhill. \"About 1,100 people have gone, and the majority won't be coming back. It's like a bereavement,\" says Chris Mullan, who chairs one of two residents' associations, and lives in a one-person flat. Gloria Travers, who chairs the other group, and whose family has grown up in her three-bedroom town house, says: \"We've got to put the community together again, but I don't think the lower density will make any difference.\" </p> <p>What they, and everyone else agrees, is that the Chalkhill used to be a marvellous place to live. \"The dream was a road to the sky; whole communities would move to the area; it would be car free,\" recalls Harrod, \"It didn't work totally, but it didn't fail, totally, either.\" </p> <p>It certainly began on a high note. Between the wars, the northern strip of land which eventually became the estate was occupied by a line of detached houses with large gardens. By the 1950s, the owners had died or moved; commercial developers bought the properties and proposed a private estate.

A unit in every kitchen chewed up all items of waste and so avoided the need for traditional refuse collection. There was none of the trauma of high-rise - the blocks were five storeys, arranged in crab-claw configurations, with decks running their length. These were designed so milk floats could make door to door deliveries. </p> <p>Years later, Livingstone complained that the Conservatives were dumping homeless families on the estate. But it was very different early on. Chalkhill was choosy about its dwellers. \"You had to have a reference from an employer and from a bank so you could become a tenant,\" recalls Travers, who moved with her husband, an electrician, and her then young family from rented accommodation in Kensal Rise. </p> <p>However, controversy struck. First it was the empty flats. Many remained vacant for long periods in the late 1960s and early 1970s because rents at \u00a36 for one bedroom and \u00a311 for five bedrooms were beyond the means of many would be-tenants - scandalous in a London with a big shortage of council accommodation. Subsidies eventually helped, but when the Tories came to power, their policy of cost rents again excluded many potential residents. </p> <p>Later, the endless decks became the haunts of muggers, vandals and drugtakers. \"They could escape by running along the walkways and nobody could catch them,\" says Harrod.

There's wide agreement, among councillors and residents, that Brent underestimated the massive maintenance that the high-tech estate needed.

As Damien speculates on the Ratcatcher's identity, he begins to suspect that it may be one of his good friends or his long-term, on-off girlfriend, Charlie Preston.</p> <p> <b>Genre and style</b><br>The novel is written in the framework of a conventional, \"page-turner\" thriller but seeks to avoid the cliches of this genre through:</p> <p>the highly personalised voice of the first person narrator. the complex histories of the characters which are explored in flashback through the narrator's eyes. The use of the present historic to recount significant or cliffhanger moments in the plot. Damien Dean is a highly fallible hero who gives the book a comic dimension through his wayward exploits and his satirical commentary on the work of the intelligence services. He is also an unreliable narrator which sets up another tension in the narrative - is he telling the truth? He is more Bernard Samson than George Smiley or James Bond. As a twentysomething in London, his life and its attendant problems of career, money and relationships mean he will find an audience who can identify with him.</p> <p>Much of the novel takes place in the fashionable areas of London, such as Soho, and mixes fictional bars, restaurants and clubs with real ones. As such, it shares some qualities with the London genre of novels. As Damien comes from the north-east of England, he is an outsider to the beau monde of London but it is through the eyes of this outsider that we see the action of the novel. Coming from Ironopolis (which is loosely based on Middlesbrough) Damien is also football daft, supporting his hometown club as they struggle to escape division one and a century of obscurity. As such, football adds to the comedy and the pathos of the novel. </p> <p><b>COPYRIGHT WARNING</b></p> <p><b>The copyright to these extracts rests with David Shayler, who has licensed their use exclusively to Guardian Unlimited.

Genre and style The novel is written in the framework of a conventional, \"page-turner\" thriller but seeks to avoid the cliches of this genre through: the highly personalised voice of the first person narrator. the complex histories of the characters which are explored in flashback through the narrator's eyes. The use of the present historic to recount significant or cliffhanger moments in the plot. Damien Dean is a highly fallible hero who gives the book a comic dimension through his wayward exploits and his satirical commentary on the work of the intelligence services. He is also an unreliable narrator which sets up another tension in the narrative - is he telling the truth? He is more Bernard Samson than George Smiley or James Bond. As a twentysomething in London, his life and its attendant problems of career, money and relationships mean he will find an audience who can identify with him. Much of the novel takes place in the fashionable areas of London, such as Soho, and mixes fictional bars, restaurants and clubs with real ones. As such, it shares some qualities with the London genre of novels. As Damien comes from the north-east of England, he is an outsider to the beau monde of London but it is through the eyes of this outsider that we see the action of the novel. Coming from Ironopolis (which is loosely based on Middlesbrough) Damien is also football daft, supporting his hometown club as they struggle to escape division one and a century of obscurity. As such, football adds to the comedy and the pathos of the novel.

      "bodyText": "Renegade former MI5 officer David Shayler has spoken to Guardian Unlimited about his new thriller, approved for publication just yesterday by the Home Office. Talking from his home in exile in Paris, Mr Shayler described the novel as an 'off the wall thriller'. \"It's about the bungling bureaucracy that I knew\", rather than the power games of George Smiley. He added that the book is a \"vindication that I'm always responsible towards national security\". Mr Shayler, 34, wrote The Organisation, also described as \"a gritty thriller about spies, sex and football\", while exiled in France. Under the terms of a High Court injunction obtained by the Attorney General in 1997, Mr Shayler is prevented from disclosing any information he gained while working for the intelligence services, whether presented as fact or fiction. To comply with the injunction, his agent Chris Joseph ostentatiously submitted the book's manuscript to the Treasury Solicitor last month as a professional dancer performed the cancan on the Home Office steps and six \"special agents\" dressed in sunglasses and dark suits played football. The application came as the former head of MI5 Dame Stella Rimington submitted a draft of her memoirs for vetting. Mr Joseph's solicitor Barney Monahan of David Price and Co said he received written confirmation from the Treasury Solicitors' Office on Monday that the book had been cleared. The letter, signed Roland Phillips, Head of the Public Law Group, said: \"I write to let you know that the Crown will not seek to restrain publication of the information in the book in the form in which it was submitted on June 1.\" The Organisation has not been sold to a publisher yet but Mr Shayler said he is hopeful a deal will be forthcoming now the book has been passed by the censors. The Guardian and Observer newspapers are currently applying to the High Court for a judicial review to challenge an order granted by an Old Bailey judge forcing them to hand over documents and e-mails relating to Shayler. The three judges yesterday reserved judgment to a later date following a two-day hearing. The Home Office confirmed that Government censors had cleared Mr Shayler's book for publication. A spokeswoman said: \"Mr Shayler put forward a text which he said was a work of fiction. \"The Government saw no reason to restrain this publication.\" The book got through without a word being cut, Home Office sources said.",

But, by the time that I joined in the early 1990s, the Organisation had abandoned its policy of touring schools and offering the malleable potential recruits jobs in the Civil Service, only to tell them later they were working in \"security\".

They're-issue endless tomes which have hardly been updated since the Second World War and are at best irrelevant and contradictory, if not actually dangerous. And, of course, each of the OpSy and SyCom sections needs its own, dedicated support - battalions of secretaries, clerks, electricians and photocopier engineers - for undefined \"security\" reasons, which are, of course, assessed by OpSy and SyCom. Officers elsewhere in the Organisation never question any of these assessments as they know that being seen as \"not one of us\" in the field of security is tantamount to professional suicide in the Organisation.</p> <p>Of course, the Organisation has many other sections which thrive on disseminating rulebooks, handbooks, guidance pamphlets, regular circulars, bulletins, tomes and volumes to a controlled (and captive) audience.

And up till then - going back before my time - it was split between the 1930s BBC-style Ministry of Information at Curzon Street and the black Lubiyanka which runs the length of nearby Bolton Street. As office space in Central London has become more expensive, the Organisation has been shoehorned into ever cheaper and smaller accommodation over the years. The current offices are cramped, dirty and either too hot or too cold, even though we've only been here just over a year.</p> <p>I swipe in and step into the booth to be X-rayed and scanned, before I am allowed to go on my way. 09:57, it prints off. I tear off the print-out and put it in my pocket, just in case of any bureaucratic dispute later on. I'll be leaving at 18:12 today, not a minute later - unless Wendy Probit tackles me around six, in which case I could be ensconced here to gone ten for \"security reasons\". When we first came to the new building, the newly emulsioned walls gleamed in the July sun like snow as we trudged through the thick carpets to our modern, ice-grey desks in offices which were divided by frosted glass rather than the crumbling, moth-eaten plasterboard of Bolton Street. It was fairyland compared to what we had grown used to.</p> <p>But no one had budgeted for the upkeep of this new wonder so it soon began to chip and peel and, before long, the carpets became worn and frayed like old tennis balls. For some inexplicable reason, the walls were then painted standard issue Government green, the pale and sickly hue seen in a hundred Monty Python sketches satirising Whitehall. Surrounded by all this, I feel paler and sicklier as I walk down the interminable corridors, listening to the radiators clanking their monotonous, irregular beat, like death-row prisoners banging on their cell bars.</p> <p>As I get closer to the CP/3 section room, I shudder once again, first at the thought of justifying my absence to Wendy, then at the thought of yesterday. Once I'd seen the blood, I leapt out of bed, put a foot in Sunday night's unfinished pizza, stretched out a hand to steady my balance and electrocuted myself on the barren bulb socket protruding from an old lamp on the bedside table. I then vomited into the bin before finally forcing myself to look down in the same way I have to force myself to watch a last minute Ironopolis penalty. My genitals were still there but retracted and covered with an oily slick of semen. Blood was running down my leg like lubricant down a Castrol can.</p> <p>I smelt her cigarettes again, the cool menthol. I searched to recognise her but couldn't. Then, I realised she was no longer wearing that dark-red wig. I stared at her short, spiky dark hair. She looked just like she did when I first met her at the Freshers' Fair at Cally, when she stood there in her innocence and her dungarees not far from the Lesbian Action Group stall watching a rugger bugger facetiously trying to book some \"hot lesbian action\".</p> <p>It is strange to think that at that moment - that precise moment, the one before I said: \"Just ignore them, they're rugger buggers\" and she spun round to look at me with those eyes like sin - we felt nothing for each other but indifference. If I'd never have whispered those words, we'd never have spoken and we'd never have had the opportunity to cut each other to the emotional quick as we have done over the last few years. It is better, they say, to have love and lost than never to have loved at all. But they never saw Dolores and me at our worst.</p> <p>Then, just as I realised there were a hundred questions I had to ask her, she looked at her pink translucent Swatch and declared: \"Duty calls. I'm off. See you in Ronaldo's at eight,\" before daintily stepping out of my cramped bedroom and clicking shut the front door behind her. I belatedly went to scamper after her, only to realise I was naked, my penis retracted like a snail in its shell, shy and embarrassed. I picked up her red wig and threw it on the floor in frustration. I knew then, I would have to make that date, that evening, last night in fact.</p> <p><b>COPYRIGHT WARNING</b></p> <p><b>The copyright to these extracts rests with David Shayler, who has licensed their use exclusively to Guardian Unlimited.

The current offices are cramped, dirty and either too hot or too cold, even though we've only been here just over a year. I swipe in and step into the booth to be X-rayed and scanned, before I am allowed to go on my way. 09:57, it prints off. I tear off the print-out and put it in my pocket, just in case of any bureaucratic dispute later on. I'll be leaving at 18:12 today, not a minute later - unless Wendy Probit tackles me around six, in which case I could be ensconced here to gone ten for \"security reasons\". When we first came to the new building, the newly emulsioned walls gleamed in the July sun like snow as we trudged through the thick carpets to our modern, ice-grey desks in offices which were divided by frosted glass rather than the crumbling, moth-eaten plasterboard of Bolton Street. It was fairyland compared to what we had grown used to. But no one had budgeted for the upkeep of this new wonder so it soon began to chip and peel and, before long, the carpets became worn and frayed like old tennis balls. For some inexplicable reason, the walls were then painted standard issue Government green, the pale and sickly hue seen in a hundred Monty Python sketches satirising Whitehall. Surrounded by all this, I feel paler and sicklier as I walk down the interminable corridors, listening to the radiators clanking their monotonous, irregular beat, like death-row prisoners banging on their cell bars. As I get closer to the CP/3 section room, I shudder once again, first at the thought of justifying my absence to Wendy, then at the thought of yesterday. Once I'd seen the blood, I leapt out of bed, put a foot in Sunday night's unfinished pizza, stretched out a hand to steady my balance and electrocuted myself on the barren bulb socket protruding from an old lamp on the bedside table. I then vomited into the bin before finally forcing myself to look down in the same way I have to force myself to watch a last minute Ironopolis penalty. My genitals were still there but retracted and covered with an oily slick of semen. Blood was running down my leg like lubricant down a Castrol can. I smelt her cigarettes again, the cool menthol. I searched to recognise her but couldn't. Then, I realised she was no longer wearing that dark-red wig. I stared at her short, spiky dark hair. She looked just like she did when I first met her at the Freshers' Fair at Cally, when she stood there in her innocence and her dungarees not far from the Lesbian Action Group stall watching a rugger bugger facetiously trying to book some \"hot lesbian action\". It is strange to think that at that moment - that precise moment, the one before I said: \"Just ignore them, they're rugger buggers\" and she spun round to look at me with those eyes like sin - we felt nothing for each other but indifference. If I'd never have whispered those words, we'd never have spoken and we'd never have had the opportunity to cut each other to the emotional quick as we have done over the last few years. It is better, they say, to have love and lost than never to have loved at all. But they never saw Dolores and me at our worst. Then, just as I realised there were a hundred questions I had to ask her, she looked at her pink translucent Swatch and declared: \"Duty calls. I'm off. See you in Ronaldo's at eight,\" before daintily stepping out of my cramped bedroom and clicking shut the front door behind her. I belatedly went to scamper after her, only to realise I was naked, my penis retracted like a snail in its shell, shy and embarrassed. I picked up her red wig and threw it on the floor in frustration. I knew then, I would have to make that date, that evening, last night in fact.

Tory leader William Hague kicked off the exchange by asking the prime minister to reveal the name of the government member responsible for the idea of on-the-spot fines to curb disorderly conduct and drunken hooliganism, which were rejected by the police at the end of last week. In what quickly turned into a game of political ping-pong where the players kept asking questions rather than answering them, Tony Blair demanded to know whether the shadow cabinet was prepared to support the Labour policy of introducing fixed-penalty notices in place of the now discarded on-the-spot fines. Pointing out that such punishments were \"yet another gimmick from a government of gimmicks\", Mr Hague asked about measures such as child curfew orders, which had been in force for three years without leading to a single order being issued. But Mr Blair hit back, pointing to the new hospital-building programme, extra jobs and today's announcement of more cash for science programmes as examples of \"substance, not spin\". The debate on law and order eventually gave way to a question from the leader of the opposition on remarks made by Britain's ambassador in Japan, Sir Stephen Gomersall, on the growing urgency for Britain to join the European single currency. Mr Hague argued that the announcement of the hooliganism-curbing measures had in fact been designed to hide the ambassador's comments - leaked earlier this week. The leaks were a symptom of the prime minister's \"weakness and failure of leadership\" of his government, the opposition leader jibed. The question of Europe was picked up on by Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy, who also asked Mr Blair to state the government's position on the European question.

He is known to have bankrolled the Labour leader, his close friend, to the tune of several million pounds before the 1997 general election.</p> <p>More recently, he has become the target for Tory gibes about Labour sleaze, when it was disclosed that he paid just \u00a35,000 in income tax last year, despite being a multimillionaire.</p> <p>In Israel, he has been accused of channelling more millions to Barak's One Nation movement before last year's general election. Israeli politicians are forbidden to seek or take foreign donations.</p> <p>Levy strongly denies the claim, just as he and Blair deny there is anything improper about key diplomatic missions being entrusted to an untrained, unelected pal of the prime minister.</p> <p>Downing Street is playing down the significance of Levy's absence from today's talks. A spokesman said that the prime minister had met Barak in the past without Levy being present, and would do so again.</p> <p>Levy will not have long to wait before he hears details of the discussions. He is hosting a party in London tonight, which the prime minister will attend.</p> <p>Blair has long coveted a role in the tortuous Middle East peace process, now approaching another of its interminable deadlines.</p> <p>Israel's key ally and paymaster, the USA, has invited Barak and Palestinian president Yasser Arafat to Washington for a three-way summit next week.</p> <p>Israel favours a summit, in advance of the highly notional September 13 target date for a final settlement.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair met his Israeli counterpart Ehud Barak in London today, with his special envoy Lord Michael Levy staying discreetly on the sidelines. Levy is the focus of scandals in both countries. He is known to have bankrolled the Labour leader, his close friend, to the tune of several million pounds before the 1997 general election. More recently, he has become the target for Tory gibes about Labour sleaze, when it was disclosed that he paid just \u00a35,000 in income tax last year, despite being a multimillionaire. In Israel, he has been accused of channelling more millions to Barak's One Nation movement before last year's general election. Israeli politicians are forbidden to seek or take foreign donations. Levy strongly denies the claim, just as he and Blair deny there is anything improper about key diplomatic missions being entrusted to an untrained, unelected pal of the prime minister. Downing Street is playing down the significance of Levy's absence from today's talks. A spokesman said that the prime minister had met Barak in the past without Levy being present, and would do so again. Levy will not have long to wait before he hears details of the discussions. He is hosting a party in London tonight, which the prime minister will attend. Blair has long coveted a role in the tortuous Middle East peace process, now approaching another of its interminable deadlines. Israel's key ally and paymaster, the USA, has invited Barak and Palestinian president Yasser Arafat to Washington for a three-way summit next week. Israel favours a summit, in advance of the highly notional September 13 target date for a final settlement. But with enormous gaps remaining in negotiations with the Palestinians, Arafat is reluctant to submit to certain pressure for concessions. The sticking points in the negotiations remain the same as they were when Arafat and the late Yitzhak Rabin struck their momentous peace deal in 1993. Israel still occupies most of the West Bank, which it is pledged to evacuate. There is profound disagreement over the future of some 6m Palestinian refugees scattered throughout the Middle East, and over the final boundaries and degree of autonomy of a Palestinian state. And, most contentious of all, there remains the issue of who should govern Jerusalem, annexed by Israel 33 years ago.

      "bodyText": "BID NOW IN SERIOUS TROUBLE Phrases like \"dead as a Dodo\" and \"when hell freezes over\" hung uneasily in the Zurich air. Vultures - rare in Switzerland at this time of year - circled overhead. Meanwhile, the organisers of England's World Cup 2006 bid remained defiantly upbeat: with a half-decent final presentation to Fifa's executive committee, tomorrow's vote might just swing their way. And so campaign director Alec McGivan took the stage to front a slick 30-minute presentation, which included four short films showing positive images of English soccer (no we can't think of that many either) set to a rousing rendition of \"I vow to thee my country\". McGivan then pledged to invite 12 children from each member country to the World Cup should the decision go our way. Well, when you've already wasted \u00a310.5m...

MAINE PAIN Joe Royle and his assistant Willie Donachie have been rewarded with spanking new contracts for their hard work in setting Manchester City up for a big fall, sorry, for leading the club back to the Premiership.

A Royal Society survey found that, while 20 years ago 18.4% of Britain's top scientists live abroad, that figure is now 26%. The scheme announced today should lessen one pressure on scientists to leave Britain. The government's advisers believe underinvestment in British science's capital base, grotty buildings and antiquated equipment, have contributed to the brain drain.

British scientists have repeatedly innovated only for the profits to be reaped elsewhere.

      "byline": "Sally Weale",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It began with an empty feeling in her arms. A physical sensation that something was missing and a longing to cradle a baby in her arms. Susan Johnson was in her late 30s and after years of making a career for herself as a highly regarded novelist, she found she wanted a child. Her new book, A Better Woman, is an account of the birth of her two sons and its painful aftermath. It is a highly personal story, a confession, one woman's extraordinary tale, but it speaks to many. </p> <p>Every mother has her own birth story. Johnson's is not for the squeamish - but then neither is life. With the birth of her first son, Caspar, her body was pushed to its very limits and it failed her, humiliatingly, miserably. She developed a recto-vaginal fistula - a small fissure running between her rectum and her vagina - which later resulted in a temporary colostomy. \"What an outcome from having one little baby,\" a therapist commented before surgery. </p> <p>What happened to Johnson was extreme and rare - the story of her physical collapse is unlikely to be yours. But her narrative is a powerful evocation of the traumatic journey a woman - any woman - makes from non-mother to mother. You are the same, yet different. You are forced to relate to the world and everyone in it differently. </p> <p>It is about the wonder, the joy, the messiness, the exhaustion, the non-stop screaming, the blood and the guts and the gore. It is about the all-consuming demands of a newborn baby and the dramatic impact on your life of giving life to another. As Johnson writes: \"A new baby craves nothing less than the whole of its mother, a mother's arms, a mother's body, a mother's milk, a mother's sleep. A new baby takes the sleep from your eyes, the breath from your lungs, a new baby requires that you lay your body down as the bridge on which he will learn to stand.\" </p> <p>When you meet Johnson, what strikes you first is the care she must have taken with her appearance. A 43-year-old Australian, she is orderly, neat. Her long dark hair is carefully blow-dried, her clothes, all polka dots and bold colours, are well chosen. This is a woman who likes to feel in control; a woman who knows what it is like to lose that control. </p> <p>In an era when we are increasingly filled with a sense of our own omnipotence, a belief that everything is ours for the taking, whenever we like, Johnson's book is a scary reminder that rather than being in control of life we are often at its mercy. \"I'm one of that great 'me generation'. We felt we had absolute control over our lives. You could choose when to have a child, when not to have a child,\" she says. </p> <p>\"What you come up against with questions of reproduction and childbirth is the fact that it's not all about you. I think it's a great lesson in realising that you do not have ultimate control of your destiny. We cannot control life so why do we think we can control birth? </p> <p>\"It's the unexpected, the dramatic. It's about forces beyond our control. It's one of those extreme, primitive passages.

      "bodyText": "It began with an empty feeling in her arms. A physical sensation that something was missing and a longing to cradle a baby in her arms. Susan Johnson was in her late 30s and after years of making a career for herself as a highly regarded novelist, she found she wanted a child. Her new book, A Better Woman, is an account of the birth of her two sons and its painful aftermath. It is a highly personal story, a confession, one woman's extraordinary tale, but it speaks to many. Every mother has her own birth story. Johnson's is not for the squeamish - but then neither is life. With the birth of her first son, Caspar, her body was pushed to its very limits and it failed her, humiliatingly, miserably. She developed a recto-vaginal fistula - a small fissure running between her rectum and her vagina - which later resulted in a temporary colostomy. \"What an outcome from having one little baby,\" a therapist commented before surgery. What happened to Johnson was extreme and rare - the story of her physical collapse is unlikely to be yours. But her narrative is a powerful evocation of the traumatic journey a woman - any woman - makes from non-mother to mother. You are the same, yet different. You are forced to relate to the world and everyone in it differently. It is about the wonder, the joy, the messiness, the exhaustion, the non-stop screaming, the blood and the guts and the gore. It is about the all-consuming demands of a newborn baby and the dramatic impact on your life of giving life to another. As Johnson writes: \"A new baby craves nothing less than the whole of its mother, a mother's arms, a mother's body, a mother's milk, a mother's sleep. A new baby takes the sleep from your eyes, the breath from your lungs, a new baby requires that you lay your body down as the bridge on which he will learn to stand.\" When you meet Johnson, what strikes you first is the care she must have taken with her appearance. A 43-year-old Australian, she is orderly, neat. Her long dark hair is carefully blow-dried, her clothes, all polka dots and bold colours, are well chosen. This is a woman who likes to feel in control; a woman who knows what it is like to lose that control. In an era when we are increasingly filled with a sense of our own omnipotence, a belief that everything is ours for the taking, whenever we like, Johnson's book is a scary reminder that rather than being in control of life we are often at its mercy. \"I'm one of that great 'me generation'. We felt we had absolute control over our lives. You could choose when to have a child, when not to have a child,\" she says. \"What you come up against with questions of reproduction and childbirth is the fact that it's not all about you. I think it's a great lesson in realising that you do not have ultimate control of your destiny. We cannot control life so why do we think we can control birth? \"It's the unexpected, the dramatic. It's about forces beyond our control. It's one of those extreme, primitive passages. I don't think anything can prepare you for that. I've had to learn to my cost that sometimes you can't have everything. Sometimes not everything is risk-free. Sometimes you have to pay for what you get. We're not very fond of that idea - that sometimes there are costs.\" In some ways childbirth in the western world has become sanitised - or at least has the appearance of being sanitised.

My top tip would be, don't go through to the departure lounge until they're calling your flight: in a lot of holiday airports there's not much to do landside, but there's absolutely nothing to do airside. At least you can play outside, have games on the trolleys (don't give those back until you're sure you won't be hit by a delay), even play with the sticky labels our holiday company provided for our suitcases. Travelling with another family helps, too. </p> <p>\u0095 Verdict: Don't rush to gates </p> <p><strong> Simon Elsey </strong> Programme director, Simply Travel specialist agency </p> <p> For many young children, flying is an adventure in itself - so if you are delayed at the airport you can make plane-spotting seem a lot of fun. Why not buy some postcards of the planes you've seen? They are often available at airport shops. Another good time-filler is to make lists of things you'd like to do on your holiday, if the delay is on the outward-bound flight - or a list of things you've done if you're on your way home. If you've got a guide book which contains useful words and phrases in the language of the country they're visiting, you could teach your kids a few of them.</p> <p>\u0095 Verdict: Language lessons</p> <p><strong> Jan Parker</strong> Co-author, Raising Children, Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a39.99 </p> <p> Don't give kids everything too soon. I once saw a mum negotiate a five-hour airport delay. As her three children reached screaming pitch she pulled personal stereos from her bag, placed one on the head of each grouchy child, switched on their story tapes and then for herself produced a well- thumbed book and a can of Guinness. Quite a survival kit. Games may help. Uno, a colours-and-numbers card game, is my kids' favourite. The Pass the Pig dice game makes them laugh and the dreaded Gameboy can suddenly seem worth every penny.</p> <p>\u0095 Verdict: Pace the treats</p> <p><strong> Catherine Holmes</strong> Mother of Madeleine, aged 14 months </p> <p> We took Madeleine round the world when she was six months old. Thankfully we didn't experience many flight delays. But I took lots of toys with me - things like her \"snuggly\", which she likes. It helps if you're breastfeeding: you might feel like a milking machine, but at least your baby is happy and quiet. Now she's older it's more difficult - this summer I'll take board-books to keep her occupied, and lots of snacks - raisins, rice cakes and so on. It's not a good idea to expect too much of small European airports; have your survival kit with you.</p> <p>\u0095 Verdict: Take snacks</p>",

There are many shops including a Manchester United FC outlet - something for everyone. \u0095 Verdict: Plan ahead Peter Stanford Father of two, author and broadcaster We took our children to Corsica a few weeks ago, and there was a delay on the return trip. My top tip would be, don't go through to the departure lounge until they're calling your flight: in a lot of holiday airports there's not much to do landside, but there's absolutely nothing to do airside. At least you can play outside, have games on the trolleys (don't give those back until you're sure you won't be hit by a delay), even play with the sticky labels our holiday company provided for our suitcases. Travelling with another family helps, too. \u0095 Verdict: Don't rush to gates Simon Elsey Programme director, Simply Travel specialist agency For many young children, flying is an adventure in itself - so if you are delayed at the airport you can make plane-spotting seem a lot of fun. Why not buy some postcards of the planes you've seen? They are often available at airport shops. Another good time-filler is to make lists of things you'd like to do on your holiday, if the delay is on the outward-bound flight - or a list of things you've done if you're on your way home. If you've got a guide book which contains useful words and phrases in the language of the country they're visiting, you could teach your kids a few of them. \u0095 Verdict: Language lessons Jan Parker Co-author, Raising Children, Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a39.99 Don't give kids everything too soon. I once saw a mum negotiate a five-hour airport delay. As her three children reached screaming pitch she pulled personal stereos from her bag, placed one on the head of each grouchy child, switched on their story tapes and then for herself produced a well- thumbed book and a can of Guinness. Quite a survival kit. Games may help. Uno, a colours-and-numbers card game, is my kids' favourite. The Pass the Pig dice game makes them laugh and the dreaded Gameboy can suddenly seem worth every penny. \u0095 Verdict: Pace the treats Catherine Holmes Mother of Madeleine, aged 14 months We took Madeleine round the world when she was six months old. Thankfully we didn't experience many flight delays. But I took lots of toys with me - things like her \"snuggly\", which she likes. It helps if you're breastfeeding: you might feel like a milking machine, but at least your baby is happy and quiet. Now she's older it's more difficult - this summer I'll take board-books to keep her occupied, and lots of snacks - raisins, rice cakes and so on. It's not a good idea to expect too much of small European airports; have your survival kit with you. \u0095 Verdict: Take snacks",

Not just from Cormier's other hard-hitting and often controversial books for teenagers, but from any book for young adults. </p> <p>For a start, it is written as a prose poem. This might initially be off-putting for some readers but the writing is so unforced and yet so lyrical, the images so startling and the observation so acute that the book carries the reader along like a rushing river. </p> <p>It is the tale of one summer, 70 years ago, in the life of a paper boy, Eugene. Suffused with Catholic guilt, Eugene walks the streets of the town as a silent witness to its secrets: the suicides and near suicides, the unquiet dead, the crippled, the bullied and bullies. Most of all it chronicles his Eugene's relationship with a father who is \"as unknown as a foreign language\" but at the crucial moment manages to affirm his love for Eugene in the tiniest of gestures. </p> <p>A wonderful book that every father and every son should read. </p> <p><strong> How to buy the books</strong><br> </p> <p> Off the shelf is a monthly selection of the best new titles.

The story is not original - the magic is in the execution. Gliori combines a simple rhyming text with bright expressive drawings that evoke both the strange shadowy world of the night and its distorted perspective. It is a familiar world rendered unfamiliar and fantastical. </p> <p>There is wit at work here, too: Gliori plays delightfully with the fiction of a book within a book suggesting that the tale is a bear or child's dream and also a bedtime story read by the bear's mother. The result is something both wild and adventurous, cosy and safe. </p> <p> <strong> The Lemonade Genie </strong> by Adrian Boote (Orchard, \u00a37.99; CultureShop price \u00a35.99) </p> <p> Colin Crumbly is a walking disaster area, the kind of boy who blows his nose without a handkerchief and demolishes entire buildings when he trips over his own feet. </p> <p>Things can only get worse when he opens his lunchtime lemonade and unleashes a genie. Not the helpful, Aladdin sort of genie, but one called Keith who unleashes mayhem on Moonwood County primary school. Soon, double-decker buses are falling from the sky, the emergency services are on full alert and the headmaster has to be extracted from up the left nostril of one of several giant Colin clones. </p> <p>A funny, fizzy read, full of the snotty, banana-skin humour so appreciated by children of this age. </p> <p> <strong> The Boy and the Dog Who Walked to the Moon</strong> by Nicholas Cross (Floris, \u00a34.99; CultureShop price \u00a33.99) </p> <p> Tomas, a young orphan living in Granada, works in conditions of near slavery at a local inn. So when he meets a dog called Don Alfonso, who suggests that Tomas should join him in his attempt to walk to the moon, the boy decides that he has little to lose and much to gain. </p> <p>Talking dogs, raging bulls and the wild weaver of the Alpujarras who spins rainbows, magic and philosophy remind us that what we so often consider to be facts about the world around us may only be assumptions. After all, as Don Alfonso explains, the only reason dogs bark is because people are too impatient to listen to them. </p> <p>A distinctly European folktale. </p> <p> <strong> The Power of One</strong> by Bryce Courtenay (Puffin, \u00a35.99; CultureShop price, \u00a33.99) </p> <p> \"First with your head and then with your heart,\" the boxer tells Peekay, a young English boy growing up in a racially divided South Africa. </p> <p>It is a lesson that Peekay learns as he sets out to fulfil his ambition to become welterweight champion of the world.

His own folks, of course, think he is just perfect. </p> <p>There is a vibrant, cartoonish quality to both words and pictures, and there is something wonderfully reassuring in this story for both children and parents as it points to the fact that one person's bad behaviour is another person's good, that we are all different and that making friends isn't half as easy as it's cracked up to be. </p> <p>A little gem of genuine comic exuberance. </p> <p> <strong> Read Me a Story, Please</strong> chosen by Wendy Cooling (Dolphin Giant, \u00a39.99; CultureShop price \u00a37.99) </p> <p> I know you're not supposed to look at books this way, but this 50-story anthology works out at less than 20p a story. You can introduce your offspring to Francesca Simon's Horrid Henry and Lucy Coates's rewriting of Hans Christian Andersen's The Tinderbox, great original stories such as Anne Fine's How To Read in the Dark, and Vivian French's tale about the wolf who, after seeing how others suffer at the hands of the three little pigs, decides that huffing and puffing is not for him. </p> <p>Penny Dann's boisterous illustrations give the book a clear identity, and parents will find the labelling of each story, as a two, five or 10 minute read aloud tale, very helpful. </p> <p> <strong> Toad Rage </strong> by Morris Gleitzman (Puffin, \u00a33.99; CultureShop price \u00a32.99) </p> <p> When Uncle Bart tells his nephew Limpy that humans don't hate cane toads, Limpy is disinclined to believe him, not least because seconds later Bart is not Limpy's fattest uncle, but his flattest - squashed beneath the wheels of a truck. </p> <p>Gleitzman's novel, set against the background of the forthcoming Sydney Olympics, takes a satirical look at mascots and marketing, and asks why we love cuddly koalas but abhor slimy, warty creatures. </p> <p>This rewarding read is a great introduction to the work of Gleitzman. If they enjoy this one, get some of Gleitzman's other humorous but harder hitting books such as Two Weeks with the Queen and Blabber Mouth. </p> <p> <strong> Raspberries on the Yangtze</strong> by Karen Wallace (Simon and Schuster, \u00a37.99; CultureShop price 5.99) </p> <p> This is not about the Chinese river but a children's hideaway in rural Canada in the 50s. The story turns into a junior version of Kate Atkinson's Behind the Scenes at the Museum as the sunny, innocent world of childhood (in which young Nancy sells the facts of life for 15 cents a throw and spends idyllic summers playing on logs on the river) is invaded by an adult world of sexual scandal and malicious gossip. </p> <p>Wallace writes perceptively and with a gentle, quizzing humour about the confusion of children confronted with the festering secrets of grown-ups.

Much of the money will be directed at nurturing PhD students in key sciences, the chancellor will tell 20 American and British financiers at a conference in London on enterprise and technology. The centrepiece of today's announcement will be a joint venture with the Wellcome Trust, one of the world's biggest research groups, that is being described as \"bigger and better\" than the government's investment in Wellcome's successful programme to crack the human genome. Mike Dexter, director of the Wellcome Trust, said: \"I am delighted that this partnership with government can mean such a massive increase in science research infrastructure throughout the UK. We are delighted to have played our part in this initiative.\" The funding could mean that research students currently financed by the government's research councils will see their salaries catch up with the fewer but better-paid students supported by the trust. Research councils last year announced a \u00a31,000 boost to PhD grant students. As a result minimum grants are currently set at \u00a36,500 a year. But this is still well short of the \u00a312,000 salaries enjoyed by research students backed by Wellcome. American researchers are much better paid and Bill Gates, the Microsoft computer billionaire, is investing massively in Cambridge to finance research students who might otherwise be without funds. Academics and ministers have been concerned about the effect of tuition fees on the number of students who take up places, especially in engineering and physical sciences - some of which are longer courses. Alarm bells were sounded two years ago when rising numbers of unfilled studentships were reported. In addition, surveys of undergraduates have suggested that increasing debts and small PhD grants are causing many final-year university undergraduates to now think twice about research careers. The spending announcement today by Mr Brown is the second large tranche of money to be allocated by the Treasury as part of the rolling spending review that will be announced in full later this month. Labour is under pressure from the scientific community, which is disappointed with its failure to reverse the slow drain in funds under the Tory governments of John Major and Margaret Thatcher. The debate over PhD funding has intensified in recent years as government officials realised how important research students are for the future livelihood of academic communities, and for many industries. At the same time there has been increasing realisation of how badly research students have been treated up to now. They are among the worst paid professional trainees in the country.

The only contact from her before last night's email was a telephone call to her college dean, made shortly after her disappearance, saying she was \"OK, but needed some space\". Her father Farooq, 43, has been joined by university officials over the past few days in making impassioned pleas for her to return as fears grew for her safety. Suggestions that she may have run away due to academic pressures were dismissed by both parties. It was revealed yesterday that she had passed her end of year exams. A police source indicated today that Sufiah had left the city of her own will because of personal problems with her family and did not yet wish to return home.

      "body": "<p>The lad wheeling a Raleigh Chopper across the workroom floor has everything to please your granny. John is well spoken, smiles, talks intelligently and, until lately, had a good job with BP. The only trouble with John is that he used to set fire to things. He's inside for arson, reckless driving and heavy-handed assault. John expects six years when he returns to court for sentencing. </p> <p>The bikes along one wall, the racks of tools and the heavy-duty mechanics' frames could be the back of some big bike shop. But this is the youth jail - the young offenders' institution alongside the Porridge-like pile of Norwich prison. </p> <p>The lads make themselves coffee and call the boss by his first name. But a door never opens without being locked again. The bikes being mended by the team of six in red overalls will go to good causes overseas and, with luck, get the boys back into society. Some, admittedly, will get there sooner than others - John reckons on serving four of his anticipated six years. </p> <p>John Bannister, who set up the workshop, says: \"A lot of the kids in here, if you looked at their home lives, you would see they had been thrown out, perhaps for good reason. And their parents have either been in jail or they're jail potential.\" </p> <p>The bikes come in by the vanload, maybe three dozen at a time, and are collected soon afterwards by charities which have sent a shopping list of what they need most for Romania or Botswana or wherever. </p> <p>Norwich is one of just three youth jails with a bike workshop. Its 160 young offenders know well the value of working there - and not simply the \u00a38 a week they get instead of the usual \u00a32.50. </p> <p>\"This may be the first time these boys have done anything productive,\" says Bannister. \"If we sold the bikes for profit, there would be trouble. But they know where the bikes are going and when the letters and pictures start coming back showing people using the bikes, the boys will be touched. That's when it will get to them.\" </p> <p>Take \"Essex\" Tony, 21, sent down for three years for breaking and entering. He will be out in seven months. At one time it seemed he might not live that long. </p> <p>\"I've been in trouble and in prisons since I was 16,\" he says, as he works on a child's bike. Until jail, his only interest in bikes was BMX stunt riding and he paid his younger brother to do all his spannering for him. </p> <p>\"I was a heroin addict on the out and I just used to flip in here. It was the loneliness because, being so far from home, my family couldn't get in to see me.\" </p> <p>\"Flipping\" is jail slang for lashing out at prison officers and generally being what Bannister calls \"a real out-and-out tearaway\". But Tony's trade was decorating, so Bannister got him painting an old office, fixing up shelves and shifting rubbish to turn it into a workshop. The work won him a place on the bike team. </p> <p>\"I've completely changed, haven't I?\" he says, looking for confirmation from Bannister. \"OK, I do still get down and flip now and then, but you know my worth now, don't you?\" Another check for approval. \"They say 'Oh, Tony's having a bad day, but he'll be OK.'\" </p> <p>In seven months, Tony will be out, looking for a job and enjoying life with his girlfriend whom he met over the prison fence. \"She came to look for another bloke and shouted out her address and I wrote to her,\" says Tony. \"Now she comes in to see me and I want to stay here in Norwich with her and look for a job somewhere.\" </p> <p>The prison fence is a regular meeting place. The lads can't get to it, but they can gaze down at the girls who gather there. \"One of the girls threw two plastic bottles of Jack Daniels over the fence the other night,\" says Russell Fish, the project manager. \"I don't know how she thought her boyfriend was going to get them, but they were found in the morning by the security patrol.\" </p> <p>Fish is a member of the Breckland cycling club in central Norfolk and a devotee of bicycles. After 15 years in a factory, he walked into a job centre and signed up to help Bannister set up Bicycle Recycle. \"It was like I'd fallen on my feet,\" he says. </p> <p>In his office are job details and the boys' records. Their work, along with some exam papers, adds up to the equivalent of a level one national vocational qualification. \"For most of them,\" Bannister says, \"it's their first experience of work. Why work if you can just go out and rob? Having to get out of bed in the morning and turn up for work, that's new for a lot of them.\" </p> <p>Their first thought when they get out will be to get drunk, but the trick is to get them straight into the system of work and rehabilitation before they are tempted to re-offend. Neither Bannister nor Fish can say definitively that working on bikes makes a youth less likely to return to crime. For the moment, though, there's hope - and bicycles are supplying it. </p> <p>\"It's astonishing what we get in,\" says Fish. \"We had a really good tandem in here the other day. Usually, they just need new tyres or inner tubes, the brakes need work and the whole lot needs cleaning up. We've got the tools and the manpower and there's only a small percentage we have to throw away.\" </p> <p>But the supply needs to increase. To help more young offenders, meet demand for their output, the scheme needs more bikes. For John, it may be too late. But for Tony, and others like him, it may come just in time. </p> <p>\u0095 Some names have been changed </p> <p> <strong> In touch with the outside</strong></p> <p>The Norwich scheme is one of 72 projects run by the Inside Out Trust, a charity set up in 1993 to meet the dual aims of providing meaningful work for prison inmates and products for good causes at home and overseas. </p> <p>More than 700 prisoners and young offenders now work on projects including translating Braille books for blind people, repairing sewing machines and refurbishing toys and play equipment. In 1996, the charity won a Guardian Jerwood award for excellence. </p> <p>At Norwich, the charity supplies everything except the project manager's wages, which are met by the prison service. Margaret Carey, Inside Out's founding director, says the scheme is typical of the way the charity is now seeking to develop projects that give the workers a basic qualification to take with them when they return to the outside world. </p> <p>\"It's an add-on, if you like, so that you have the charity work through which the prisoners feel part of the community, but they get a certificate as well. When they come out, they may be able to get an engineering job, say, on the basis that they have already done some training.\" </p> <p>Many of the projects, like Norwich, are small. But the charity has recently won funding from the Northern Rock Foundation, enabling it to develop a workshop that will ultimately employ more than 60 prisoners at Frankland jail in Durham. The charity has also benefited from the national lottery. </p> <p>Carey says Inside Out's approach is spreading. \"We may be working with only 1% of the prison population but people are looking at copying the ideas, which is marvellous. We are acting as catalyst for change.\"</p> <p>\u0095 The Inside Out Trust can be contacted on 01273-833050.</p>",

But Tony's trade was decorating, so Bannister got him painting an old office, fixing up shelves and shifting rubbish to turn it into a workshop. The work won him a place on the bike team. \"I've completely changed, haven't I?\" he says, looking for confirmation from Bannister. \"OK, I do still get down and flip now and then, but you know my worth now, don't you?\" Another check for approval. \"They say 'Oh, Tony's having a bad day, but he'll be OK.'\" In seven months, Tony will be out, looking for a job and enjoying life with his girlfriend whom he met over the prison fence. \"She came to look for another bloke and shouted out her address and I wrote to her,\" says Tony. \"Now she comes in to see me and I want to stay here in Norwich with her and look for a job somewhere.\" The prison fence is a regular meeting place. The lads can't get to it, but they can gaze down at the girls who gather there. \"One of the girls threw two plastic bottles of Jack Daniels over the fence the other night,\" says Russell Fish, the project manager. \"I don't know how she thought her boyfriend was going to get them, but they were found in the morning by the security patrol.\" Fish is a member of the Breckland cycling club in central Norfolk and a devotee of bicycles. After 15 years in a factory, he walked into a job centre and signed up to help Bannister set up Bicycle Recycle. \"It was like I'd fallen on my feet,\" he says. In his office are job details and the boys' records. Their work, along with some exam papers, adds up to the equivalent of a level one national vocational qualification. \"For most of them,\" Bannister says, \"it's their first experience of work. Why work if you can just go out and rob? Having to get out of bed in the morning and turn up for work, that's new for a lot of them.\" Their first thought when they get out will be to get drunk, but the trick is to get them straight into the system of work and rehabilitation before they are tempted to re-offend. Neither Bannister nor Fish can say definitively that working on bikes makes a youth less likely to return to crime. For the moment, though, there's hope - and bicycles are supplying it. \"It's astonishing what we get in,\" says Fish. \"We had a really good tandem in here the other day. Usually, they just need new tyres or inner tubes, the brakes need work and the whole lot needs cleaning up. We've got the tools and the manpower and there's only a small percentage we have to throw away.\" But the supply needs to increase. To help more young offenders, meet demand for their output, the scheme needs more bikes. For John, it may be too late. But for Tony, and others like him, it may come just in time. \u0095 Some names have been changed In touch with the outside The Norwich scheme is one of 72 projects run by the Inside Out Trust, a charity set up in 1993 to meet the dual aims of providing meaningful work for prison inmates and products for good causes at home and overseas. More than 700 prisoners and young offenders now work on projects including translating Braille books for blind people, repairing sewing machines and refurbishing toys and play equipment. In 1996, the charity won a Guardian Jerwood award for excellence. At Norwich, the charity supplies everything except the project manager's wages, which are met by the prison service. Margaret Carey, Inside Out's founding director, says the scheme is typical of the way the charity is now seeking to develop projects that give the workers a basic qualification to take with them when they return to the outside world. \"It's an add-on, if you like, so that you have the charity work through which the prisoners feel part of the community, but they get a certificate as well. When they come out, they may be able to get an engineering job, say, on the basis that they have already done some training.\" Many of the projects, like Norwich, are small. But the charity has recently won funding from the Northern Rock Foundation, enabling it to develop a workshop that will ultimately employ more than 60 prisoners at Frankland jail in Durham. The charity has also benefited from the national lottery. Carey says Inside Out's approach is spreading. \"We may be working with only 1% of the prison population but people are looking at copying the ideas, which is marvellous. We are acting as catalyst for change.\" \u0095 The Inside Out Trust can be contacted on 01273-833050.",

It is important to write and talk about employment issues, but we must also do something about it. David Congdon Director of public affairs Mencap Serious affront I realise that I'm an incorrigibly frivolous person, but I can't be the only one who viewed the new front page with dismay. I can't believe that fewer ridiculous things are happening around the country, or that even the most serious minded people really want to be serious all the time. Robin Saxby Wrexham Society's front page was my weekly treat. I almost always saved it because our children (in their 30s) were equally hooked. Now on page 12, small, mingy and hard to read, it is not worth bothering with. You have so many arresting, serious articles throughout your paper, so please restore it to its pride of place.

      "body": "<p>Nobody even knows how many Jarawa there are. Estimates range from 200-700, but it is impossible to tell. They speak no other language and no one speaks theirs. No one knows where they came from, although DNA studies suggest that their nearest relatives may be the T'wa, or \"bushmen\", of southern Africa. </p> <p>We do know from examination of abandoned camps that they hunt game such as wild pig and monitor lizard, fish with bow and arrow, and gather seeds, berries and honey. We know that they are nomadic, living in bands of 40-50 people, that they live in large communal houses or, when hunting, in small family huts. </p> <p>We also know that, until recently, they have resisted contact with the outside world - despite Indian settlers camping on their doorstep. They also seem to have a lively sense of humour and enjoy shocking the Indian government officials on their now-monthly contact missions by urinating on their feet and squirting breast milk at them, while falling about laughing. </p> <p>In 1998, they suddenly began to come out of the rainforest reserve along the western side of two of the main Andaman Islands. There are theories about why they decided to emerge: that a boy who was treated in hospital in 1996 told others that out siders were friendly; or that they lack enough food - although their obvious good health contradicts this. Some newspapers even suggest they have been lured out by a desire to eat curry! None of the arguments is convincing. </p> <p>When the Jarawa came out they were at first just looking around. Sometimes they stopped cars and buses, and some even got on to the buses and the ferries that take vehicles across the creeks between the islands. They appeared to be as fascinated by the settlers as the settlers were by them. </p> <p>After the first few months, the adults remained in the reserve, and now it is mostly the kids and youths that come out. They sometimes stop cars on the roads and ask for food, or just hang around the shops at the jetties. The bulk of the population, including the men who do the hunting, still spend their time in the forest. </p> <p>So far there have been no missionaries allowed into the area. One group from the north-east of India applied to go into the Jarawa area, but has been refused permission by the Indian administration. </p> <p>Earliest reports of the Andamanese tribes come from Marco Polo. He described them as having \"heads like that of the dog, with teeth and eyes likewise\". In 1857, when the British arrived, they tried to befriend the islands' tribes. They succeeded with the Great Andamanese but not with the Jarawa - which is undoubtedly the reason why they are still alive and living on their own land today. </p> <p>But now the Indian government is intending to \"resettle them\". The consensus among island settlers and government employees is that the tribe is \"primitive\", and that it should be \"civilised\". By this it is meant that the members should become agriculturalists and wear clothes. The plan is for their \"gradual integration\" into the mainstream, and a court case brought by a local lawyer is forcing the issue. </p> <p>In May 1999, the lawyer filed a case seeking to have the Jarawa settled. She stated: \"This is high time to make them acquainted with modern civilisation.\" She has no specialist knowledge or experience: she saw Jarawa from a passing vehicle and felt that something should be done. The court convened an expert committee to examine the issue, a process which is still ongoing. The future of the Jarawa now rests with this committee. </p> <p>Anthropologists are convinced that settlement would be disastrous. Evidence from around the world is that when nomadic peoples are settled, disease and extinction usually follow. Isolated tribal peoples have no immunity against the diseases, such as influenza and measles, that thrive in high density populations. It is not unusual for 50% or more of a population to die soon after settlement. </p> <p>In Brazil, half of the 180 Matis tribe died after they were contacted, and of the 600 Panar\u00e1 contacted in 1972, only 69 survive today. After epidemics - often killing the old and very young - severe depression, a loss of confidence in their way of life, alcohol abuse, dependency and suicide often follow. </p> <p>Witness the fate of the 5,000 strong Great Andamanese tribes who were contacted and settled by the British after 1857. Massive epidemics followed, along with addictions and dependency. Only 28 people now remain in government \"breeding centres\", where births are reported in the same way as the births of pandas in zoos. </p> <p>Following a campaign by Survival, a petition opposing settlement was handed to the Indian government last week. It was signed by 46,500 people from 61 different countries. Probably as a result, the government now claims it never had any intention to settle the Jarawa. </p> <p>No one has been able to consult the Jarawa about what they want because no one speaks their language. There are two government linguists trying to learn their language, but this is a very slow process. </p> <p>It is not simply because the Jarawa are of enormous interest to anthropology that they should be allowed to continue living as they choose. It is not because they have a lot to teach us which would otherwise be lost. And it is not because they may provide a vital clues to prehistoric human migration. The reason that we should all be involved in stopping any attempt to forcibly settle or assimilate the Jarawa is that it is just plain wrong to take this people's land from them. </p> <p>I believe that forcibly settling the Jarawa is tantamount to genocide. It would lead to them being wiped out. What right has any government, however well meaning, to impose its judgment of what is \"civilised\"? The Jarawa's future is their own, and they should be the ones to decide how they spend it. </p> <p>\u0095 Sophie Grig works for Survival.

They also seem to have a lively sense of humour and enjoy shocking the Indian government officials on their now-monthly contact missions by urinating on their feet and squirting breast milk at them, while falling about laughing. In 1998, they suddenly began to come out of the rainforest reserve along the western side of two of the main Andaman Islands. There are theories about why they decided to emerge: that a boy who was treated in hospital in 1996 told others that out siders were friendly; or that they lack enough food - although their obvious good health contradicts this. Some newspapers even suggest they have been lured out by a desire to eat curry! None of the arguments is convincing. When the Jarawa came out they were at first just looking around. Sometimes they stopped cars and buses, and some even got on to the buses and the ferries that take vehicles across the creeks between the islands. They appeared to be as fascinated by the settlers as the settlers were by them. After the first few months, the adults remained in the reserve, and now it is mostly the kids and youths that come out. They sometimes stop cars on the roads and ask for food, or just hang around the shops at the jetties. The bulk of the population, including the men who do the hunting, still spend their time in the forest. So far there have been no missionaries allowed into the area. One group from the north-east of India applied to go into the Jarawa area, but has been refused permission by the Indian administration. Earliest reports of the Andamanese tribes come from Marco Polo. He described them as having \"heads like that of the dog, with teeth and eyes likewise\". In 1857, when the British arrived, they tried to befriend the islands' tribes. They succeeded with the Great Andamanese but not with the Jarawa - which is undoubtedly the reason why they are still alive and living on their own land today. But now the Indian government is intending to \"resettle them\". The consensus among island settlers and government employees is that the tribe is \"primitive\", and that it should be \"civilised\". By this it is meant that the members should become agriculturalists and wear clothes. The plan is for their \"gradual integration\" into the mainstream, and a court case brought by a local lawyer is forcing the issue. In May 1999, the lawyer filed a case seeking to have the Jarawa settled. She stated: \"This is high time to make them acquainted with modern civilisation.\" She has no specialist knowledge or experience: she saw Jarawa from a passing vehicle and felt that something should be done. The court convened an expert committee to examine the issue, a process which is still ongoing. The future of the Jarawa now rests with this committee. Anthropologists are convinced that settlement would be disastrous. Evidence from around the world is that when nomadic peoples are settled, disease and extinction usually follow. Isolated tribal peoples have no immunity against the diseases, such as influenza and measles, that thrive in high density populations. It is not unusual for 50% or more of a population to die soon after settlement. In Brazil, half of the 180 Matis tribe died after they were contacted, and of the 600 Panar\u00e1 contacted in 1972, only 69 survive today. After epidemics - often killing the old and very young - severe depression, a loss of confidence in their way of life, alcohol abuse, dependency and suicide often follow. Witness the fate of the 5,000 strong Great Andamanese tribes who were contacted and settled by the British after 1857. Massive epidemics followed, along with addictions and dependency. Only 28 people now remain in government \"breeding centres\", where births are reported in the same way as the births of pandas in zoos. Following a campaign by Survival, a petition opposing settlement was handed to the Indian government last week. It was signed by 46,500 people from 61 different countries. Probably as a result, the government now claims it never had any intention to settle the Jarawa. No one has been able to consult the Jarawa about what they want because no one speaks their language. There are two government linguists trying to learn their language, but this is a very slow process. It is not simply because the Jarawa are of enormous interest to anthropology that they should be allowed to continue living as they choose. It is not because they have a lot to teach us which would otherwise be lost. And it is not because they may provide a vital clues to prehistoric human migration. The reason that we should all be involved in stopping any attempt to forcibly settle or assimilate the Jarawa is that it is just plain wrong to take this people's land from them. I believe that forcibly settling the Jarawa is tantamount to genocide. It would lead to them being wiped out. What right has any government, however well meaning, to impose its judgment of what is \"civilised\"? The Jarawa's future is their own, and they should be the ones to decide how they spend it. \u0095 Sophie Grig works for Survival.

With demand so high for qualified professionals of all types to help with relief work, a pool of appropriate finance staff is a major time saver. \"Mango makes our job easier,\" says Tim Boyes Watson, head of finance at Christian Aid. \"The biggest problem in an emergency is the need to move fast and normal recruitment takes too long.\" Huge amounts of money can be spent in the first few weeks of an operation. \"We want financial control from the word go and all donors want to know how their money has been spent.\" Richings, a 58-year-old Australian citizen who discovered Mango via the internet, is now into his third week as Christian Aid's financial controller in Kosovo, responsible for accounting, procurement and warehousing. He is clear about his role. \"I see the need for financial control as imperative to ensuring that the monies that have been donated are spent in an effective way and are accounted for as transparently and effectively as possible,\" he says. Already he recognises the work is challenging and at times frustrating and upsetting. On a journey back from Kosovo's capital Pristina last week, he says he saw \"ample evidence of destruction on a very personal scale... fresh graves... the scars of bullets of every calibre\". But with \"no two days the same\", he says the work is ultimately satisfying. It is a far cry from most people's idea of accountants at work. But if Mango continues to flourish, many more could be headed the same way. \u0095 For further information about Mango, contact Alex Jacobs on 01865 433885 or via the website: www.mango.org.uk",

But it is just not do-able for \u00a350 per night.\" </p> <p>As the government prepares to publish a green paper containing fresh plans to ratchet up the quality of social services, leading figures in social care will gather in London on July 17 to debate the quality agenda. The aim of the conference, organised jointly by the Guardian and the National Institute for Social Work (NISW), is to get a variety of perspectives on the issue. </p> <p>John Hutton, the social care minister, will be among those speaking at the event and delegates will be listening closely to how the government expects its raft of initiatives - such as best value, performance assessment frameworks, joint reviews and the new regulatory framework - to gel. Even if they do, will improved performance necessarily result? </p> <p>Not without greater investment, says Patel, who will speak at the conference. As a provider, he might be expected to complain about local authorities putting the screws on costs, but he is not the only one who thinks that cost cutting has gone too far. </p> <p>Les Bright, deputy chief executive of Counsel and Care, a charity which works with older people in residential and nursing homes, echoes his concerns. \"Local authorities are driving down prices year in and year out,\" he says. \"In some cases, they are paying as little as you or I would to stay in a bed and breakfast for the night.\" </p> <p>Patel, emerging as a key player in development of health and social care modernisation, says his sector absorbed \"enormous\" costs in implementing measures such as the working time directive and the minimum wage. \"It costs money to train staff well and give them a sense of vocation about the work,\" he says. \"Everyone aspires to good standards; a range of activities, single rooms and en suite bathrooms - it's not unreasonable to expect those things. There are cowboys everywhere, but on the whole people care.\" </p> <p>Bright says that the squeeze on fees has a direct impact on residents' quality of life. Homeowners under pressure will cut back on decorating from once every two or three years to once every five. The number of leisure activities on offer for residents is also likely to be reduced. </p> <p>In its response to the government's consultation document on national standards for residential and nursing home care, issued at the end of last year, Counsel and Care has argued that the push to raise standards is an opportunity to make local authority purchasers \"comply with national standards of funding\". </p> <p>John Ransford, head of social affairs at the Local Government Association, rejects the idea that there is a need for a national \"price list\" setting out what local authorities should pay for services, regardless of local demand or supply. In effect, he suggests that local councils should be able to drive down the price where they can. But services should be planned in conjunction with the independent sector. </p> <p>\"It is time to sit down with contractors and say what the contract should look like, taking into account staff training, etc,\" Ransford says. A protocol and a good practice guide would be fine, but the price paid should be determined locally, he says. </p> <p>Patel admits, somewhat ruefully, that local authorities have done a \"fantastic\" job driving prices down. \"But if they want a long-term viable market,\" he says, \"they need to look at what it costs to provide care\". </p> <p>Ransford counters that comparisons with hotel costs are meaningless. \"What you need to look at is the level of service that is being provided for the money,\" he insists. What is important, he argues, is that commissioners and providers of care need to have an open relationship and understand each other's problems. But he admits that this sort of relationship is hard to nurture within the contract culture, \"which often makes people go to the wall on determining the price\". </p> <p>Daphne Statham, director of the NISW, agrees that greater openness will improve the services on offer, although she accepts that a cultural change is needed before service users become as involved in care planning as they need to be. </p> <p>Local authorities need to be up-front about what people have a right to expect, Statham says. \"The complex nature of how we make judgments should be explicit. It is the least people can expect when the decisions are affecting the quality of their lives.\" </p> <p>Staff should be able to explain why they arrive at a decision or judgment. \"They should also be much clearer about when there are alternative decisions that could have been made, and about when they don't know what to do,\" Statham says. And everybody in social services needs to own the standards, whatever they are, and try to deliver them in a far more consistent way \"regardless of where the service is coming from\", she says. </p> <p> Of course, openness can be hard to achieve in a climate where social care staff are publicly pilloried for mistakes. Statham believes, however, that the planned \"social care institute of excellence\" will herald a new era of transparency by promoting evidence-based practice. </p> <p>Social services departments are currently undergoing some of the most intensive monitoring they have ever experienced, especially of services for elderly people, children and those with disabilities. But whether the government has gone far enough in its attempt to raise standards will become clearer as the remaining planks of the strategy are put into place. </p> <p>Some of the questions about funding should be answered by the forthcoming comprehensive spending review.

      "trailText": "<p><strong>Profile:</strong> Max Caller, the new chief executive of Hackney</p>",
      "byline": "Peter Hetherington",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>For many, it was the job from hell. \"I know the cesspits of London extremely well,\" smiles Max Caller. He's talking about the miles of sewers he had to endure as a young municipal engineer in the early 1970s, checking that the capital's problems were all flushed away. Not the most popular job, he admits - yet infinitely less hassle-free than his current position. </p> <p>He knows this one is really the job from hell because it was advertised as just that. No matter that it offered a nice \u00a340,000 salary hike to \u00a3150,000, as a final inducement for the faint-hearted. \"It wasn't the money,\" he insists. \"It was the challenge.\" </p> <p>But this is Hackney. It's been labelled the country's ungovernable council, a nightmare authority with untold financial problems, a partly-privatised education service, damning inspections from Ofsted and the social services inspectorate, and this week an equally critical report from the district auditor alleging mismanagement and inadequate accounting on a large scale. Refuse collection is notoriously erratic and there's confusion in the housing service, which, at the last count, left over 20,000 with rent arrears and hundreds fearing eviction. And if all that wasn't bad enough, political leadership - how can one put it kindly? - has been tenuous because no party has had overall control in four years. Who would really want to be chief executive of this east London borough? </p> <p>Step forward Caller. After a little persuasion, it seems, from the right people in local government, he finally moved into the hot seat three weeks ago and set about changing a culture of defeatism. For the wider town hall establishment, Hackney is seen as a test case for local government - through the newish Improvement and Development Agency and the Local Government Authority - to put its own house in order without government interference. So was his arm twisted? </p> <p>\"Not in the formal sense,\" he says, \"but a number of people I respect said I should think about this and told me I was one of the few people who can do it, which is flattering.\" </p> <p>Caller's rise to the top had been relentless. Starting working life as a civil engineer at the former Greater London Council in 1972, pounding those sewers, he was transferred to Thames Water two years later when (pre-privatised) water authorities were established. By 1975, he was at the then west London borough of Hammersmith as an assistant engineer and, three years on, moved east along the Thames to Newham to take charge, in effect, of inner-city and riverside regeneration. By 1982, he had moved south to Merton, where he eventually became director of technical services. In 1989, however, he went north to leafy Barnet, north London, as chief executive. </p> <p>For some, 49-year-old Caller talks big, in the manner of ambitious people wanting to get things done fast. Former colleagues describe him as a strong-minded executive (\"doesn't suffer fools gladly\") who can unnerve staff by taking a close interest in the minutiae of departmental business when it suits him. </p> <p>Detractors might point to cosy Barnet being light years away from chaotic Hackney. \"OK, two-thirds of Barnet is rich and prosperous,\" he says. \"But the other third is characterised by all the problems of the inner city . . . multi-million pound villas cheek by jowl with poverty.\" </p> <p>He helped set up one of the first town hall cabinets in 1988 (\"we wanted to show how far we could get under existing law\"), but winces at the suggestion that his old borough is a model of New Labour modernisation (actually, it's run by a joint Labour/Lib-Dem administration). </p> <p>Why Hackney? \"I always said if the good people in local government do not do the tough jobs, the tough jobs never get done. It was a challenge that needed to be done. I thought I had the skills to do it. People in Hackney are getting a raw deal.\" </p> <p>He was not prepared to take a contract. He explains this on the grounds that too often top people take short-term contracts, of a year or so, then complain they haven't had time to deliver lasting change. </p> <p>\"I am actually thrilled, excited,\" he says. \"You don't get an opportunity like this very often. If it works - and it will - the people of Hackney will get a better deal and a joined-up council doing the right things for them.\" </p> <p>But, surely, some doubts? \"Nothing I would admit to...\". Then it's off to address another crisis. The district auditor beckons. But at least there's now an agreement between Labour and the Conservatives to try to run the council effectively. Some harmony has broken out. In Hackney, that's progress.</p>",

Not the most popular job, he admits - yet infinitely less hassle-free than his current position. He knows this one is really the job from hell because it was advertised as just that. No matter that it offered a nice \u00a340,000 salary hike to \u00a3150,000, as a final inducement for the faint-hearted. \"It wasn't the money,\" he insists. \"It was the challenge.\" But this is Hackney. It's been labelled the country's ungovernable council, a nightmare authority with untold financial problems, a partly-privatised education service, damning inspections from Ofsted and the social services inspectorate, and this week an equally critical report from the district auditor alleging mismanagement and inadequate accounting on a large scale. Refuse collection is notoriously erratic and there's confusion in the housing service, which, at the last count, left over 20,000 with rent arrears and hundreds fearing eviction. And if all that wasn't bad enough, political leadership - how can one put it kindly? - has been tenuous because no party has had overall control in four years. Who would really want to be chief executive of this east London borough? Step forward Caller. After a little persuasion, it seems, from the right people in local government, he finally moved into the hot seat three weeks ago and set about changing a culture of defeatism. For the wider town hall establishment, Hackney is seen as a test case for local government - through the newish Improvement and Development Agency and the Local Government Authority - to put its own house in order without government interference. So was his arm twisted? \"Not in the formal sense,\" he says, \"but a number of people I respect said I should think about this and told me I was one of the few people who can do it, which is flattering.\" Caller's rise to the top had been relentless. Starting working life as a civil engineer at the former Greater London Council in 1972, pounding those sewers, he was transferred to Thames Water two years later when (pre-privatised) water authorities were established. By 1975, he was at the then west London borough of Hammersmith as an assistant engineer and, three years on, moved east along the Thames to Newham to take charge, in effect, of inner-city and riverside regeneration. By 1982, he had moved south to Merton, where he eventually became director of technical services. In 1989, however, he went north to leafy Barnet, north London, as chief executive. For some, 49-year-old Caller talks big, in the manner of ambitious people wanting to get things done fast. Former colleagues describe him as a strong-minded executive (\"doesn't suffer fools gladly\") who can unnerve staff by taking a close interest in the minutiae of departmental business when it suits him. Detractors might point to cosy Barnet being light years away from chaotic Hackney. \"OK, two-thirds of Barnet is rich and prosperous,\" he says. \"But the other third is characterised by all the problems of the inner city . . . multi-million pound villas cheek by jowl with poverty.\" He helped set up one of the first town hall cabinets in 1988 (\"we wanted to show how far we could get under existing law\"), but winces at the suggestion that his old borough is a model of New Labour modernisation (actually, it's run by a joint Labour/Lib-Dem administration). Why Hackney? \"I always said if the good people in local government do not do the tough jobs, the tough jobs never get done. It was a challenge that needed to be done. I thought I had the skills to do it. People in Hackney are getting a raw deal.\" He was not prepared to take a contract. He explains this on the grounds that too often top people take short-term contracts, of a year or so, then complain they haven't had time to deliver lasting change. \"I am actually thrilled, excited,\" he says. \"You don't get an opportunity like this very often. If it works - and it will - the people of Hackney will get a better deal and a joined-up council doing the right things for them.\" But, surely, some doubts? \"Nothing I would admit to...\". Then it's off to address another crisis. The district auditor beckons. But at least there's now an agreement between Labour and the Conservatives to try to run the council effectively. Some harmony has broken out. In Hackney, that's progress.",

Information is forwarded to Fort Meade in Maryland where 40,000 NSA analysts work, according to the French, \"without democratic control\". Reports that Cheltenham handed on information which sabotaged at least two big French deals in Saudi Arabia will revive criticism that the British are bad Europeans and still favour the so-called \"special relationship\" with the US. This is disappointing news for French diplomats who, with France presiding over the 15-nation EU for the next six months, have been putting around the message that Britain under New Labour was fast evolving into a Euro-friendly force. \"The atmosphere today around the negotiating table is incredibly relaxed in comparison to the bitterness of the Thatcher and the Major years, when British and French negotiators only thought of scoring the most points off each other,\" a French foreign office adviser said. \"Echelon can only revive suspicion that loyalties inside British delegations are divided.\"",

      "bodyText": "Newspapers and former security service officers must be prevented from disclosing information about the activities of British intelligence, even if it revealed involvement in a plot to assassinate the head of a foreign government, the high court was told yesterday. The assertion was made by prosecution lawyers who are insisting that the Guardian and Observer must hand over any emails or notes they may have relating to the former MI5 officer, David Shayler. The newspapers are challenging a ruling by an Old Bailey judge that they should give to the police special branch any information they may have from Mr Shayler about a plot to kill Colonel Gadafy, the Libyan leader, in 1996. Asked by Mr Justice Gibbs whether the disclosure of such a plot would be seriously damaging, Clare Montgomery QC, counsel for the crown prosecution service, replied: \"Yes\". It would lead to a loss of confidence in MI5's ability to retain confidential material, she said. When the judge suggested it would be far less damaging if the public knew the security and intelligence services were involved in unlawful activities, she replied that according to the Official Secrets Act, such disclosures would still be damaging. \"One man's whistleblower is another man's traitor\", she said. The prosecution wants the original of a letter Mr Shayler wrote to the Guardian in February confirming the existence of the Libyan plot and the notes of Martin Bright, an Observer journalist who reported that Mr Shayler had named two MI6 officers involved in the plot. Ms Montgomery insisted it was \"absolutely vital\" for the police to get their hands on the material. Without that evidence Mr Shayler probably could never be prosecuted, she claimed. Michael Tugendhat QC, counsel for the newspapers, pointed to other, much earlier, evidence showing that Mr Shayler had previously disclosed information about the plot. They included a BBC Panorama programme cleared by government lawyers in 1998 and a book on the Shayler affair published last year. \"Why the Guardian, why now?,\" asked Mr Tugendhat. \"The police have got to start somewhere\", Ms Montgomery told the court. Earlier, Ben Emmerson, QC for Mr Bright, insisted the journalist was entitled to protection from self-incrimination, a principle established in common law and in the European convention on human rights. Asked by Lord Justice Judge whether she could give an undertaking that Mr Bright would not be prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act, Ms Montgomery said she could not. She suggested that Mr Bright could be prosecuted not only for disclosing information but for trying to encourage Mr Shayler for placing the names of MI6 officers on the internet. Mr Shayler might feel aggrieved if he was prosecuted and Mr Bright was not, she told the court. The prosecution needed the information, she added, to prepare secrets charges against Mr Shayler who says he plans to return to Britain voluntarily in the autumn.

      "body": "<p>Carol Barnes, the television newscaster told the Daily Mail in an interview last week: \"My marriage and job had become stale. The children were growing up and I decided it was time for me.\" </p> <p>At 55, she has joined a growing list of celebrities who have left long-term marriages: Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall, Robin and Margaret Cook, Norman and Rosemary Lamont, Roger and Luisa Moore - they all separated after at least 19 years of marriage, and all had teenagers or children in their 20s. </p> <p>This is not just a celebrity trend. The number of divorces between people over 45 has risen by a third over the past decade, an increase 10 times greater than the total rise in divorce. Between 1986-96, there was a 15% rise in divorces after 20 years of marriage, more than double any other category. </p> <p>It is not always the case that parents wait before living separate lives. During their children's teenage years, parents feel less needed, which can leave a yawning gap. Often that gap is filled by an affair or major lifestyle change which does not include the partner. People who had much in common in their 20s may find themselves living with someone from whom they have grown apart. In the past couples were more likely to have accepted the situation. Now that the stigma attached to divorce has gone, they question it and take control of their lives. However, many parents assume that because their children are older the divorce will affect them less emotionally. </p> <p>Barnes's youngest child, for example, is 18, the average age a child leaves home.

      "bodyText": "Carol Barnes, the television newscaster told the Daily Mail in an interview last week: \"My marriage and job had become stale. The children were growing up and I decided it was time for me.\" At 55, she has joined a growing list of celebrities who have left long-term marriages: Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall, Robin and Margaret Cook, Norman and Rosemary Lamont, Roger and Luisa Moore - they all separated after at least 19 years of marriage, and all had teenagers or children in their 20s. This is not just a celebrity trend. The number of divorces between people over 45 has risen by a third over the past decade, an increase 10 times greater than the total rise in divorce. Between 1986-96, there was a 15% rise in divorces after 20 years of marriage, more than double any other category. It is not always the case that parents wait before living separate lives. During their children's teenage years, parents feel less needed, which can leave a yawning gap. Often that gap is filled by an affair or major lifestyle change which does not include the partner. People who had much in common in their 20s may find themselves living with someone from whom they have grown apart. In the past couples were more likely to have accepted the situation. Now that the stigma attached to divorce has gone, they question it and take control of their lives. However, many parents assume that because their children are older the divorce will affect them less emotionally. Barnes's youngest child, for example, is 18, the average age a child leaves home. He is one of an increasing number of teenagers and students who find that life after adolescence is not just a matter of getting used to raging hormones and academic stress, but coming to terms with the break-up of a family to whom they are still emotionally attached. Sometimes divorce results in the sale of the family home, making the children feel more alone and rootless. \"It just felt too weird to go 'home' to my mum's new flat,\" says Amanda Stevens, whose parents divorced during her second year at university. \"So I really made university my home and stayed up in my student house during the holidays with my boyfriend.\" Such a sudden cutting of ties can leave young people overly dependent on friends who may not be able to support them in a crisis.

While it may be imperfect, my explanation (Juvenile Violence in a Winner-Loser Culture, Free Association Books, 1995) increasingly looks to be the most likely one: that the rise was largely caused by Mrs Thatcher's policies. </p> <p>The rate of increase in violence against the person from 1950 to 1979 was like the acceleration of a Metro - a steady average of 3,000 more crimes a year. The rate of increase between 1980 and 1986 was not much faster - a middle-range Sierra at 4,000. But since 1987 there has been an acceleration like a formula one Ferrari: an average 12,000 more crimes a year. </p> <p>The joyrider on this statistical rocket is increasingly likely to be juvenile. Juvenile violence also rose from 1987 and the proportion of all juvenile crime that is violent doubled (despite the fact that juvenile violence should actually have been falling by one fifth, because of a 20% drop in the birthrate in the 70s - there were actually one fifth fewer youths around to commit crime). </p> <p>Worldwide and throughout history, people who commit violence are nearly all young, from a low income family and male. </p> <p>Studies of identical twins and adopted boys prove that genes or biological makeup are very rarely involved. Rather, the difference is caused by three aspects of parenting in childhood: severe physical abuse, usually dressed up as punishment; witnessing parental disharmony, with or without fighting; and maternal irritability, nearly always caused by depression. </p> <p>Using all the family predictors, we can estimate with an 80% accuracy which of the one in five of all boys who are aggressive will become the violent men. What causes these violence-inducing parental patterns? The answer is very well known: a low income. A Home Office funded study following 412 boys from age eight found that 42% of the boys from the poorest homes had become seriously violent by the age of 32. All the studies there have ever been have had similar findings. </p> <p>It then stands to reason that the more boys being raised in low income homes in a given society, the more boys there will be experiencing violence-inducing care; and the more violent men there will be a few years later. </p> <p>In 1979 in Britain, 19% of boys were being raised in a low income home (defined as 140% of supplementary benefit - about \u00a3160 a week). From 1981 the proportion was 30% and it has only recently begun to fall. So I estimate that every year since 1981, an additional 17,000 16-year-old boys who will become violent have been growing up. </p> <p>And that, I believe, is why violence started to mushroom in 1987: more boys from Thatcher-created violence-inducing homes growing up to be violent men. Neither the police nor the present government can possibly be blamed for the fact that Mrs Thatcher spawned an American-shaped society with a dog-eat-dog, winner-loser culture and violence statistics to match. </p> <p>What is more, my theory accords with the broader picture. Assaults are twice as common in poorer, developing nations as opposed to richer, developed ones. Between developed nations, murder rates correlate strongly with the size of the gap between rich and poor in the nation - the more inequitable, the more murderous. North America has a very large proportion of its population living in almost shanty town conditions, with virtually no health or other welfare support. It also has by far the most millionaires. This, far more than its gun laws (only half its murders involve guns), explains why America is far and away the most violent developed nation. </p> <p>A 70s study found that the higher the levels of benefit, the lower the levels of violence in the States across America. Texas was both one of the most violent and the least supportive of its poor people; Wisconsin one of the least violent and most supportive. </p> <p>To give it its due, this government is well aware of all this, especially Jack Straw and Gordon Brown, with his war on child poverty. To what extent they will actually address the huge disparities in rich and poor remains to be seen, but Surestart and attempts to improve the income of low-income parents are surely signs that the government does have an eye on the long-term violence statistics. </p> <p>But in the shorter term, it is not so easy to see what they can do. The uncomfortable truth is that Mrs Thatcher's violent legacy will be with us for a great many years to come. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Burke, a student of Italian, German and European studies at Bath University, pleaded guilty yesterday at Harlow magistrates court to harassing Ms Greer between January and April 25 by sending her distressing letters and holding her against her will. Magistrates imposed a two year probation order. Burke was ordered to undergo treatment from psychiatrist Richard Turner. She was also ordered not to contact Ms Greer nor to go within five miles of her home. The court heard that Ms Greer's ordeal was preceded by a series of letters from Burke which \"did not make a great deal of sense\". Ms Greer encountered Burke at her home on April 24. Dinah Walters, prosecuting, said: \"She gathered from conversation she had with Karen Burke, that Karen Burke was infatuated with her and wished to adopt her as some form of spiritual mother figure.\" She allowed Burke to spend the night in her summerhouse then took her to a railway station. Burke returned soon after midnight and rang the doorbell of the writer's home in Saffron Walden. Ms Greer called police who warned the student she could be arrested for harassment. But at 6.30pm the following day she arrived at the house again as Ms Greer was leaving. The writer screamed and tried to get back indoors, but Burke jumped on her back, shouting: \"Mummy, mummy, don't do that.\" The pair struggled back inside the house and in the ensuing fracas both women sustained injuries and the phone was ripped out of the wall. Dinner guests arrived at the house and found Burke holding Ms Greer by the legs. Magistrates decided against making an order for costs or compensation because the student had no income. In a statement to police, Burke said: \"I don't know what got into me. I just wanted to get all this stuff out of my head. It is an emotional thing. I wanted to hug her.\"",

All kinds of reasons have been put forward for the victory - Alec Stewart's rallying call, the allround performance of Dominic Cork, and Andy Caddick with the ball. </p> <p>But West Indians put their failure down to something rather different - Jimmy Adams blew it tactically by bowling Franklyn Rose for at least two overs too many at the end. Every time Rose came on, the pressure came off. Curtly Ambrose was being as miserly as ever from the Pavilion end - but Rose's first ball to Caddick next over was short and wide outside off-stump and smashed for four. Another short one to Cork was hooked for six. </p> <p>With 30-odd runs to get, Rose was bowling so badly and was so embarrassed by it that he looked as if he wanted the ground to swallow him up. His body language made it clear to everyone in the ground except Adams that he'd rather pick a fight with a Kingston yardie than bowl. Caddick had just fallen leg-before to Ambrose and the Windies could smell victory. It was Rose next over but tellingly, he just plodded over to his mark, nothing in his step suggesting that his team had just got a breakthrough. Even Mike Tyson's opponents look more willing. Another tight, skilful and desperately unlucky over from Ambrose, and the Caribbean supporters at the Pavilion end saw Rose removing his sweater. A hubbub of disbelief went up. An over later, the England fans gave him a standing ovation when he took up his position at fine leg. He had, of course, helped their cause hugely. </p> <p>But it would be wrong to heap all the blame on Rose, just as it would be ungracious not to give Cork, Darren Gough, Caddick, Mike Atherton and Michael Vaughan the credit they deserve. It is true to say though that he, and to a lesser extent Reon King, did not accept responsibility by taking the burden off Walsh and Ambrose. It's clear why Ambrose hasn't seen the need to retire until this series has ended, or Walsh hasn't (so far) seen the need to chuck it in at all. Walking away now would be like letting the reckless teenager run the family business. Rose and King cannot yet be trusted with the legacy. </p> <p>I watched them both bowl that afternoon in the company of Allan Rae, who formed such an effective opening batting partnership with Jeffrey Stollmeyer in the 1950 series that Ramadhin and Valentine dominated. His opinion was that King and Rose did not understand their role - which was to give away as few runs as possible and keep the pressure on the for older strike bowlers. Instead they tried too hard. \"We're lucky to have Ambrose and Walshy\", Rae told me, \"but they cannot bowl all day\". Rae does reackon King and Rose are good bowlers though. Maybe the only thing that would force them and others to step up is the great opening pair finally leaving. Walsh did not look as if he was going to be a great fast bowler when a 40-year-old batsman named Roy Fredericks was smashing him all around the Bourda ground in the 1983 Red Stripe Cup competition. So there is hope for the Windies first- and second-change bowlers. </p> <p>What about that 54 all out, their lowest-ever total against England? The England bowlers really raised their game, but the unanimous view of ex-players like Geoff Boycott and Desmond Haynes is that it was not a devilish pitch. I think it was a combination of good bowling, poor batting and some bad and crucial umpiring decisions. Barry Richards feels that the West Indies batsmen suffered far worse from the umpiring. Replays showed that Wavell Hinds and Shivnarine Chanderpaul were not even close to being dismissed, and that Adams was unlucky. How many runs were those three wickets worth? Ten, 20, 30 or 80? No-one knows for sure but in the context of a close and low-scoring game, it made the difference between victory and defeat. Funny how such a crucial factor gets overlooked in the seemingly ceaseless search for the hero by England cricket writers. The Windies will be hoping that decisions like those don't figure as much as they did when South Africa visited England in 1998, and were denied a series win through erratic decision-making by the Pakistani umpire Javed Akhtar. England do tend to get the breaks at home. </p> <p>But not everyone is blaming the umpires. Both Haynes and the Barbados-born ex-England player Roland Butcher criticised the Windies batsmen for fending off short deliveries during England's bouncer barrage, and not trying to hook or pull the ball. They were aghast at this most un-Caribbean approach to the batting, and it's fair to say that the ball off which Chanderpaul was given out caught at short leg, would have been disappearing through midwicket or over the square-leg boundary had either of these happy hookers been at the wicket. Haynes did tell me that \"any Test-playing side ought to get 187 on this pitch\", shortly after he'd seen his side collapse for 54.

In a speech to 200 British and American financiers at a conference in London this morning the chancellor will stick to his existing policy and the five economic tests that he set in 1997, despite a flurry of pro-euro leaks which yesterday triggered a full-scale Whitehall investigation. With the government's own Invest in Britain Bureau today producing figures that show 25% of all inward investment into the EU still comes to the UK, Mr Brown will praise the achievement - especially since Britain's share of US investment is 40%. But he will avoid any support for the Eurosceptic case that says such figures prove Britain can thrive outside the euro zone. That would amount to picking a direct fight with key cabinet colleagues - the foreign secretary Robin Cook, the trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers and the Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson - who endorse warnings that industry is close to \"meltdown\" because of the strong pound. Mr Brown will speak against a background of mutual sniping over the government's euro strategy and angry accusations by opponents of the currency that senior ministers - notably Mr Cook - actively connived in leaks to the Guardian and other newspapers. Yesterday's leak of a confidential Foreign Office memo from Britain's ambassador in Japan, Sir Stephen Gomersall - warning of the loss of Japanese investment if the UK does not join the euro - prompted the tycoon, Lord Hanson, to accuse Mr Cook directly. After Downing Street said Tony Blair will sack anyone - official or minister - caught making leaks, the shadow foreign secretary, Francis Maude said: \"If Robin Cook ordered this document to be leaked, will Tony Blair sack his foreign secretary?\" Mr Cook demanded an apology from Lord Hanson.

Mr Blair's junior spokesman said: \"I am sending out a very strong signal: if we can pin down where these leaks have come from, that person will be dismissed.\" Asked if that included ministers, he replied : \"Yes.\" Many MPs assume that it was the buoyant figures from the Invest in Britain Bureau that prompted pro-euro forces to get their retaliation in first by leaking Sir Stephen's warning and one from Andrew Fraser, head of the Invest in Britain Bureau - both say the government must get off the euro fence. Sir Stephen's memo said that uncertainty over the government's stance on the euro could \"trigger a much stronger move towards disinvestment in the manufacturing sector\" - a point which fellow diplomats said he would be expected to make. Lord Hanson said the leak was \"another example of spin\". \"Ambassadors do as they are told by the foreign secretary,\" he said. \"We all know that Robin Cook is desperate to force this issue ahead.\" His remarks were backed by Business for Sterling which complained of \"disgraceful\" leaks by the other side. Mr Cook retaliated. \"The suggestion that I instructed Sir Stephen Gomersall to doctor his report so that it could be leaked is an outrageous slur on a distinguished diplomat and on ministers. I am sure that when Lord Hanson reflects on what he has said, he will want to apologise. He should do so promptly,\" he said. As he said in his Mansion House speech last month the chancellor continues to believe that entry should be based on a more rounded judgment of the economic conditions. As well as the impact of euro membership on investment, the tests include whether or not the two economic cycles are sufficiently converged and what will happen to the City.",

      "bodyText": "President Jacques Chirac piled the pressure on to Tony Blair yesterday when he promised to use France's six-month presidency of the European Union to strengthen both the powers and profile of the \"Euro-11\" group of member states which have already adopted the single currency. Though French politicians and diplomats are taking an unthreatening and pragmatic stance towards the creation of a two-speed Europe, dominated by a Franco-German core, the thrust of their rhetoric may prove a serious pre-election problem to Mr Blair in the months ahead. The French EU presidency, which started on July 1, proposes to improve the functioning of the Euro 11 - soon to become Euro 12 when Greece joins next year - by giving its work more visibility and authority, Mr Chirac told Euro MPs in Strasbourg. There is also fresh encouragment for the creation of a political post of \"Monsieur Euro\" to match the foreign policy position now held by Javier Solana of Spain. With Greece joining Euro 11 in advance of its adoption of the euro next January, Denmark is holding a referendum in September, possibly followed by Sweden. Facing the prospect of a Euro 14, Britain fears that France's approach could undermine the monthly meeting of finance ministers, known as Ecofin, where Gordon Brown, the chancellor, is accepted as an equal. Whitehall's position is to be calm about pressure to make it easier for inner groups to act alone, as Britain and France do on defence. But France's explicit targeting of the Euro11 group for \"reinforced cooperation\" is worrying. \"Our attitude is 'You can do what you want provided you respect the Ecofin agreement' ,\" one official said. In theory that means that any economic decision affecting Britain would still have to be taken to the full Ecofin with Mr Brown present. Yet Paris could try to avoid difficulties by keeping any changes informal.. It is another sign that the euro juggernaut is bearing down on the British \"wait and see\" position. Harmonising taxation policy and actively preparing for the arrival of euro notes and coins in January 2002 were also identified by the French president as crucial to his social and economic plans for Europe. \"Everything practically and humanly possible must be done to ensure the success of this great step,\" he said. Mr Blair can take more comfort from Mr Chirac's remarks on the proposed charter of fundamental rights. Euro-sceptics have said this could form the basis for an EU constitution and the prime minister has threatened to block if it extends existing human rights and has legally binding force. The French president said the charter should be completed in time for the EU's next summit in Biarritz in October.

They stamped, punched and kicked Michael, known as Mossy, over his entire body, it was alleged.</p> <p>\"This was a murder which involved systematic and extreme violence, violence for its own sake,\" said Anthony Gee QC, prosecuting.</p> <p>\"Michael Moss was quite defenceless and overwhelmed. The injuries inflicted on him included an attempt to cut off his ear. The defendants, it seems, were acting out a scene from a violent film called Reservoir Dogs, according to what one of the defendants said later.\"</p> <p>Mr Gee told the jury the attack, in November last year, had been sparked by jealousy. The defendant who spoke of the Reservoir Dogs link said he believed Michael was going out with his former girlfriend.</p> <p>The three boys, all from Merseyside and all now 16, cannot be named for legal reasons. They all deny murder.</p> <p>Mr Gee told the jury: \"The case is appalling in many ways, you may think, not least because of the ages of these children, but also because of the very manner of the attack which they inflicted of Michael Moss.\"</p> <p>He asked jury members to steel themselves before showing them photographs of Michael's body and a video of the scene on the playing field.</p> <p>Michael had suffered bruises, fractures and flesh wounds to his entire body, the cuts possibly being caused by the neck of a broken bottle, the jury heard.</p> <p>There were deep cuts to his feet which had not bled, proof that they had been inflicted after Michael had died and his circulation had stopped, Mr Gee added.</p> <p>The video showed his blood splattered across the climbing frame and over the ground.</p> <p>\"The attacks delivered to Michael's head were such that he suffered a separation of two vertebrae in his neck,\" said Mr Gee. \"This was not a spontaneous outburst of violence. There was a degree of pre-meditation on the part of at least two of the defendants.\"</p> <p>The trial continues.</p>",

The three, two aged 15 and one aged 16, lured 15-year-old Michael Moss from a care home on to a playing field at night, it was said at Liverpool crown court. They attacked him, stripped him naked and carried out a \"sustained and violent assault\" over a period of two hours. They stamped, punched and kicked Michael, known as Mossy, over his entire body, it was alleged. \"This was a murder which involved systematic and extreme violence, violence for its own sake,\" said Anthony Gee QC, prosecuting. \"Michael Moss was quite defenceless and overwhelmed. The injuries inflicted on him included an attempt to cut off his ear. The defendants, it seems, were acting out a scene from a violent film called Reservoir Dogs, according to what one of the defendants said later.\" Mr Gee told the jury the attack, in November last year, had been sparked by jealousy. The defendant who spoke of the Reservoir Dogs link said he believed Michael was going out with his former girlfriend. The three boys, all from Merseyside and all now 16, cannot be named for legal reasons. They all deny murder. Mr Gee told the jury: \"The case is appalling in many ways, you may think, not least because of the ages of these children, but also because of the very manner of the attack which they inflicted of Michael Moss.\" He asked jury members to steel themselves before showing them photographs of Michael's body and a video of the scene on the playing field. Michael had suffered bruises, fractures and flesh wounds to his entire body, the cuts possibly being caused by the neck of a broken bottle, the jury heard. There were deep cuts to his feet which had not bled, proof that they had been inflicted after Michael had died and his circulation had stopped, Mr Gee added. The video showed his blood splattered across the climbing frame and over the ground. \"The attacks delivered to Michael's head were such that he suffered a separation of two vertebrae in his neck,\" said Mr Gee. \"This was not a spontaneous outburst of violence. There was a degree of pre-meditation on the part of at least two of the defendants.\" The trial continues.",

      "bodyText": "The police authorities in Fujian, the home province of the 58 Chinese migrants who died in the Dover tragedy, have broken silence to explain their inability to stop the illegal traffic in humans. They are demanding better equipment, including highspeed planes and boats and unspecified weapons, to deal with the \"snakeheads\" who organise the trade. The Fujian's border guards complain that their anti-smugging equipment is comparatively backward and in some places they have to conduct patrols in rented fishing boats. The Fujian authorities say the penalties prescribed by existing laws are too light and do not adequately deter persistent offenders. But allegations of collusion between local officials and the snakeheads have now been published in the Chinese press. A news clampdown was imposed in the province for more than a week after word of the deaths reached China. The national media reported the investigation in Britain but carried almost no information from Fujian. At the end of last week the Fujian press finally reported that a large-scale operation against the smuggling was launched on June 20, the day after news of the Dover tragedy broke. Several Chinese newspapers, including the Southern Weekend and the China Youth Daily, both known for investigative journalism, have been allowed to publish interviews with the families and local security officials. The identity of the main snakehead gang leaders is common knowledge in the districts of Changle and Fuqing and other centres of illegal emigration. The Southern Weekend reporter, who pretended to be a would-be migrant during his investigation, was given the names of several snakeheads and officials. \"There are plenty of people who can help you,\" he was told in one village. \"If you want to go to Japan in a hurry you can look for Chen Meng X - he's a township official.\" The newspaper did not publish the official's full name. The reporter was also given the name of a village Communist party secretary involved in the trade. \"It is fairly well known that the provincial authorities and the snakeheads have very good links,\" a western diplomat said yesterday. \"It is the usual problem that while cooperation can be secured at the national level, progress really depends on winning support and consent locally.\" Some foreign reporters in China who tried to visit the snakehead areas in Fujian were detained and told to leave the province. The provincial authorities have said that they are too busy to accept journalists from abroad. Fujian officials rely heavily on the long history of emigration from the province to explain why the traffic is so difficult to stop. They also blame foreign countries for lax controls and for allowing some illegal migrants to gain political asylum. A border guard spokesman suggested that the province should organise proper routes for legal migration so that people could come and go safely. A sizeable number of Fujian migrants already leave China with travel documents that are completely in order. Foreign experts monitoring the movement of migrants are accustomed to the sight of parties of Fujianese heading for central Europe or the Caribbean with valid tourist visas. The families of the migrants say that Chinese passports and third-country visas are supplied by the snakeheads or their contacts in return for payment. The Fujian authorities have not said how they intend to deal with this problem, in spite of a succession of campaigns against smuggling. The border guard chief, Colonel Wu Jiansen, has been quoted as saying that a full-scale campaign against the snakeheads was launched in April and was still under way when the new drive was started on June 20. Last year was declared to be a triumph in the struggle against the snakeheads. But local families interviewed since the Dover tragedy - even some of those who believe they have lost relatives - say they are convinced that the traffic will continue.",

The group expressed confidence about a decision from the European commission next week on whether to permit its \u00a3470m purchase of French group Danone's brewing division. Danone is the parent company of Kronenbourg, which Scottish &amp; Newcastle produces under licence in Britain. The move is crucial to the Edinburgh-based group's plans for expansion across Europe. However, there was disappointment about a 3% fall in like-for-like sales from the group's pubs. Branded pubs, including the Chef &amp; Brewer chain, did well but the figures were depressed by a poor performance from smaller, local houses. \"This company is all about the imponderable upside of Kronenbourg versus the tangible downside of the tail-end of the pub retailing estate,\" said Nigel Parsons, an analyst at West LB Panmure. Another analyst bemoaned the bad news from Center Parcs, which has been a problem for the company for many years. \"Center Parcs has managed to hand them one last disappointment - it's spitting in their eye as it walks out of the door,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "Austria upped the stakes in its response to European Union sanctions yesterday, unveiling plans for a national referendum despite repeated pleas from Brussels and member states not to go ahead with the vote. The chancellor, Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel, announced the decision after six hours of deliberation by a special committee. Austria's 14 EU partners collectively imposed an unprecedented quarantine in February when Mr Sch\u00fcssel formed a coalition government with the far-right Freedom party, then led by J\u00f6rg Haider. With France unlikely to lift sanctions during its six-month tenure of the EU presidency, Austria will use its referendum as a way of piling the pressure on a divided EU to find a way out of the impasse. It has already threatened to delay the institutional reforms needed before the union can enlarge, and there are fears that a referendum will further increase the anti-EU feelings of Austrians. Vienna demonstrated its capacity for disruption when it blocked a deal on the controversial withholding tax on savings at the EU summit in Feira, saying it could not sign for \"constitutional reasons\". As a compromise, Portugal, then holder of the EU presidency, proposed that \"three wise men\" should report on Austria's commitment to \"European values\", an approach which infuriated domestic opinion in Austria. Mr Haider was on the committee which made yesterday's referendum decision. EU countries have been appalled by his past comments sympathetic to aspects of Nazi rule and his party's use of xenophobic slogans in last year's parliamentary election. The referendum will consist of six questions, starting with: \"Should the federal government...ensure by all possible means that the unfairly imposed sanctions on Austria be lifted immediately?\" Subsequent questions, interpreted by observers as opposition to the EU's eastward expansion, include the future form the EU should take and whether it is fair that larger countries can override the will of other states. Mr Sch\u00fcssel denied last night that the referendum was tantamount to a veto. \"The topics covered by the questions won't end in a blockade, but quite the opposite,\" he said, adding that the aim was not to hinder the union. \"We only want to change the union in a positive way.\" He put forward two possible autumn dates on which the referendum might be held - October 29 and November 26. Parliament will make the final decision Tuesday. A government spokesman insisted that the referendum would be abandoned if the EU lifted its sanctions before the autumn. Mr Haider said last night: \"I never believed a diplomatic solution would work.\" He added that he regarded the referendum as a \"fair solution\". But he said he was confident that the report of the \"wise men\" would be positive. Mr Haider, who gave up the nominal leadership of his party, has substantially increased his popularity thanks to the wave of anti-EU sentiment in Austria. Critics have warned that a referendum is likely to further strengthen his party's position and his future chances of becoming chancellor. The sanctions are relatively minor measures, such as bans on cultural and sports events and secondary military cooperation accords. Even so, they have humiliated Austria and soured the atmosphere at EU meetings. Several EU members, including Italy, Ireland, Finland and Greece, have made it clear behind the scenes that they want the sanctions lifted quickly, now that they are seen as ill-considered and hasty. But France and Belgium, which have their own far-right parties, have taken a much tougher approach.",

The legislation, to be published in draft this Friday, will come too late to save England's bid to stage the 2006 World Cup: the host nation is to be decided in Zurich tomorrow by football's world governing body Fifa, which has been waiting for signs of a new British attempt to tackle hooliganism. But it will save the face of the team making England's final presentation today. With the government's law and order credentials already tarnished, the home secretary, Jack Straw will find it hard to get the powers onto the statute book by the end of July in the name of getting rid \"once and for all of the obnoxious taint of hooliganism\". Although there were signs last night that the Tories and Liberal Democrats would back the emergency bill, it may not make it through the Lords without its most controversial elements being watered down. The government claims the rush to get the new powers made law before parliament's summer recess lies in the fact that England's next game is against France on September 2 - before MPs reassemble in October. The main battleground will come over Mr Straw's proposal to give senior police officers the on-the-spot power at an airport or train station to prevent a suspected, but not convicted, football hooligan from travelling abroad if they have grounds to believe they are out to cause trouble. The hooligan would be able to appeal to a court but only once he had been stopped from travelling.

But it was clear last night that her hint of Tory cooperation was causing deep internal tensions in her party. Long-standing Tory supporters of a hooligan crackdown, such as Simon Burns, gave the measures their backing, but senior backbenchers, including Eric Forth, David Davis and Douglas Hogg claimed the measures breached the British principle of innocence until guilt was proven in a court of law. Reflecting Tory unease over hasty legislation, Peter Ainsworth, the shadow culture secretary said: \"We don't want the fiasco of the Dangerous Dogs Act followed by a Dangerous Yobs Act.\" Shadow cabinet members said privately that Mr Straw had tabled maximalist demands in the hope that they would split the Tories, ensuring the bill did not reach the statute book by the summer and so leaving the Conservatives to shoulder the the blame for any violence that occurs this autumn or winter.

      "bodyText": "Lara Croft, the all-action cyber-heroine of the British computer games industry, is on the verge of being captured by the French. Eidos, the company that fathered the hugely popular Ms Croft, looks like becoming the latest high-profile British computer games company to be bought by a foreign competitor after receiving a takeover approach from its French rival Infogrames. The deal is an unlikely ending to one of the British business success stories of the last few years, which saw sales of Lara's Tomb Raider series of games transform Eidos from an obscure Wimbledon-based \"video compression\" firm into the first indigenous \u00a31bn computer games company. Last year the World Economic Forum named Eidos the world's most successful company ahead of leviathans such as Boeing, Hewlett-Packard and Merrill Lynch. Tomb Raider has consistently sat at the top of the sales charts. Lara's iconic status has been confirmed by marketing and advertising campaigns around the world. Her Uzi-toting antics have been splashed across billboards and buses in New York. Pop videos She has featured in pop videos, car advertisements in France, exhibits in the Millennium Dome and been subjected to salivating profiles in august US journals. She has even been made an official cultural ambassador and the Hollywood film studio Paramount will shortly release a Tomb Raider film. Demis Hassabis, chief executive of the games developer Elixir Studios, said it was not just Lara's pneumatic appearance that had proved so popular with gamers of all ages. \"Lara's physical charms are well known but as a female Indiana Jones-type figure she has become the first clearly distinguishable icon of the computer games world,\" he said. \"She captured the imagination at a time when computer games were becoming mainstream and combined with some great marketing and design has become a globally known figure.\" Now British games developers fear that unless City attitudes change towards backing creative talent in the games industry more domestic firms will be lost to overseas competitors. The games trade association Elspa plans to lobby the government for more support when the minister for tourism, film and broadcasting, Janet Anderson, attends its annual gathering next week. \"It is very, very disappointing to see yet another British games company being sold overseas,\" said Roger Bennett, Elspa director general. \"This is a domestic creative industry that is bigger than both film and music and yet there is only a handful of British owned publishers left. We are very good at inventing things but we're bloody awful at hanging on to them.\" The trend towards overseas sales is well established after Sony's acquisition of the Liverpool-based software house Psygnosis, Nintendo's investment in Rare and Gremlin Group's sale to Infogrames. Multi-billion dollar firms such as Electronic Arts of the US, Infogrames and Havas Interactive of France and now Microsoft, which is entering the market with a games console of its own, are trawling the British market looking for further acquisitions. It is not difficult to work out what they are looking for. Experts reckon that there are 80m PCs in use and 70m games platforms such as the Sony playstation, Nintendo 64 and Sega Dreamcast funding a global computer games market worth more than $17bn. Games pie According to Elspa more than \u00a31.4bn worth of computer and video games software was sold in the UK last year, outstripping cinema and video rental receipts. Britain appears to be taking a healthy slice of the games pie. A quarter of the games bought in Europe originate in the UK, as do 12% of the games bought in the US. The industry now supports about 250 development studios employing 5,600 people directly and indirectly affecting the livelihoods of around 100,000. In 1998 British developed games generated an export value of \u00a3503m exceeding export takings from either British film or TV. Analysts point out that in France shares in computer games companies such as Infogrames, Havas, Ubi Soft and Titus are given far higher values, enabling them to mount takeover bids for British rivals. However, it is not hard to find reasons why investors should be wary of the games industry. It is a \"hit-driven\" business. A publisher can have a chart-topper in one quarter and nothing in the next year's corresponding quarter, when the product of an 18-month \u00a31.5m development cycle turns out to be a flop. Other creative industries based on publishing books, records and movies have similar problems. One flop can wipe millions off a company's value. It is also a cyclical business. Games sales have minor upturns during school holidays and peak at Christmas, which can lead to disaster when games developers miss deadlines, or companies ship products before they are ready. In the longer term, fortunes rise and fall as successive generations of games technology sweep away earlier ones. The last generation of consoles - where PlayStation battled it out with the Nintendo 64 and Sega Saturn - is starting to be replaced by a new series of consoles. That means the public will not buy new releases until the consoles are in the shops and that is part of the reason why Eidos's shares have fallen so sharply. If Infogrames does manage to persuade Eidos directors to accept an offer rumoured to be worth around \u00a3700m it will be hoping that it does not get just a one-product company. Eidos has several high-profile licences in the pipeline: Who Wants to be a Millionaire, Chicken Run and three Disney-related games. By the time the industry discovers whether they are as popular as Tomb Raider, Lara will probably be storming the Bastille.

A public prosecutor has ordered the French DST counter-espionage service to build up evidence accusing Washington and London of an attack on the fundamental interests of the nation, it was confirmed in Paris yesterday. In Strasbourg today, the European parliament is likely to set up a committee to investigate Echelon, despite the opposition of most British MEPs and strenuous lobbying by the UK government. Jack Straw, the home secretary, was forced to discuss the issue for the first time at an EU meeting last month. He insisted that Britain's involvement in Echelon did not breach EU standards on the interception of communications. Britain is concerned because the issue has been presented as a choice to be made between loyalty to the US and to Europe - and because intelligence and security matters are normally strictly off-limits for the EU. Echelon is a vast electronic spying network developed from systems used during the cold war. Based at Fort Meade, in Maryland, its main listening post is run by Britain's Cheltenham-based GCHQ eavesdropping centre. Canada, Australia and New Zealand are also involved. For months, there have been accusations in France of an Anglo-Saxon conspiracy to spy on Europe's industrial secrets through 24-hour electronic surveillance. The French say huge contracts have been lost by the Thomson weapons firm and Airbus because of information gathered by the US national security agency (NSA), which oversees Echelon in cooperation with Commonwealth intelligence services. The NSA, which has a $4bn (\u00a32.7bn) budget, employs 40,000 people who interpret electronically-gathered information from all forms of communications systems throughout the world, including telephones and faxes.

      "bodyText": "Two men and a woman were arrested yesterday in connection with the savage murder of three generations of one family at their home in a Welsh village last year. Police have refused to name those arrested during early morning swoops on three separate addresses in south Wales but it is understood that those being questioned about the crime include two police officers and a former policewoman. Mandy Power, 34, her mother, Doris Dawson, 80, and her daughters Katie, 10, and Emily, eight, were bludgeoned to death at their home in Clydach, near Swansea. The killer then set the house on fire in an attempt to destroy any clues. Firemen found the family's battered bodies when they were called to the blazing house in the early hours of June 26 last year. There has been repeated criticism of the lack of progress in what has become Wales's biggest murder inquiry. Yesterday, following early morning raids on addresses in the Pontypridd and Pontardawe areas, a 38-year-old man and a 33-year-old woman were arrested. They were still being questioned on suspicion of murder last night. A second man, also 38, was held on suspicion of attempting to pervert the course of justice. A number of people linked to two of those arrested were also being interviewed by detectives. Mandy Power's semi-naked body was discovered at the top of the stairs after firemen burst into the semi-detached property where she lived. She had been sexually assaulted and bludgeoned to death with a 4ft metal rod found in the house. The rod was used to kill her two daughters and her mother, Doris Dawson, who was disabled and suffering from leukaemia. Her body, which was found in her bed, was so badly beaten she could be identified only by her wedding ring. Three appeals for help were broadcast on the BBC's Crimewatch programme - the most recent only two weeks ago - as the anniversary of the murders approached. The FBI was called in to help produce an offender profile of the killer and further expert assistance was provided by the squad working on the Jill Dando murder inquiry. More than 100 items were taken away from the burned out property for DNA testing, including a gold necklace which police believed had been ripped from a woman's neck. From the start of the inquiry detectives working on the case were convinced that Mandy Power knew her killer, and believed her complicated love life could hold the key to the murders. She was divorced from her husband Mike, 39, and had had a number of affairs with both men and women. Forensic scientists began a fingertip search of the home of the female suspect arrested in Pontypridd yesterday and took her car away for tests. A mobile incident room was also set up in Pontardawe, some 50 miles away, and a property was sealed off by police tape. Community leaders in Clydach said they were elated at the breakthrough. Councillor Roger Smith said a cloud seemed to have lifted. \"I am sure the family of the murder victims will feel heartened by the news of the arrests.\" South Wales police are continuing to ask members of the public to help with the inquiry. Detective Superintendent Martyn Lloyd Evans, who has led the murder hunt, urged people with any information they had not yet disclosed to contact the incident room.",

      "body": "<p>There is a special outfit Mark Roberts wears when he anticipates getting out of his clothes quickly. A customised pair of tracksuit bottoms and a T-shirt, with the former slit up the seams and secured with Velcro, so that it can be ripped off in two fluid moves. He wears his tracksuit bottoms without pants, socks or a sense of impending shame, although slipping into them is always a precursor to appearing naked in front of thousands of people. This week, the Velcro ripped open for the 157th time. </p> <p>The great British streaker - that quaint tradition of taking off one's clothes in public - made its summer comeback on Monday when Roberts interrupted a doubles match at Wimbledon. The 35-year-old from Liverpool chose the Kournikova-Zvereva contest to make his debut at the All England Club, following successful streaks at St Andrews golf course, Aintree and the gun-dog trials at Cruft's. He had hoped to streak across centre court during one of Kournikova's singles matches, but had to settle for court 14 when she was knocked out early. \"I've always liked a good laugh,\" he says. \"Ever since I was small.\" </p> <p>Talking to Roberts involves weathering various permutations of \"I like a good laugh\". He is cheerful in that thumbs-up, Norman Wisdom sort of way, which may strike some as creepy when used by 30-something men to denote a zany sense of humour. His mother, who likes a good laugh, is said by Roberts to be \"very proud\" of him. His children, two girls aged 11 and three, and a six-year-old boy, have a more complicated relationship with their father's streaking. The 11-year-old lives with her mother and Roberts only sees her \"once in a blue moon\", although he doesn't connect this with his exhibitionism. The six-year-old finds his father's frequent appearances on the news hilarious. \"I don't mean to hurt anyone or offend them,\" Roberts repeatedly says. So when his children grow up and are totally mortified by him, he'll stop? \"I would think greatly about it,\" he says. \"But it's just a good laugh, isn't it? I've always been a joker.\" </p> <p>What distinguishes Roberts from the common variety streaker, apart from the fact that he is an unemployed father of three, not a madcap student fulfilling a dare, is his high regard for the \"art\" of streaking. Unlike amateur streakers, Roberts has evolved a sophisticated routine involving props and body stencilling. He talks about it as his \"job\", although it makes him no money, since apart from odd shifts as a gardener, a barman and an actor, it is the only activity that defines him. \"You have to be professional about it, or else you're just another everyday streaker.\" </p> <p>At the Grand National, he donned a cowboy hat, clipped on a gunbelt and a Mexican moustache, daubed the word \"rawhide\" on his back and streaked across the race course. At St Andrews, he traversed the putting green bearing the legend, \"19th hole\". And at Cruft's, he came up with the witticism \"pedigree bum\", and stencilled it across his rump before doing a few laps of the ring. (It was met with stony silence.) </p> <p>At Wimbledon, he was in two minds over what approach to take. His first notion was to paint \"Anna Cover-me-over\" across his chest, but this idea lost out to the equally hilarious \"Only the balls bounce\", a take on the slogan for Kournikova's bra adverts. He painted on the lettering, without the aid of a mirror, in a public toilet, before taking his place for a six- hour wait in the spectator section for court 14. </p> <p>Roberts says that his only motivation is the adrenalin rush he gets from being cheered on by the crowd, as he is chased about by a red- faced constabulary (there is nothing sexual about this rush, he is keen to emphasise). </p> <p>His first streak was eight years ago when he was working in a bar in Hong Kong and was dared, by his mates, to disrupt a rugby match between the All Blacks and the Springboks. He was ejected from the stadium, only to get in an hour later and do it again. \"I wanted to die, the first time I did it,\" he says. \"But it's like an addiction. I love the publicity. I love the rush of making people laugh. I'd stop doing it straight away if they started booing.\" </p> <p>As a child, Roberts wanted to be an actor and in 1987 he made his debut as an extra in Business as Usual, a film featuring Glenda Jackson. But he didn't have the temperament to continue with it and jacked it in soon after. When his first streak made the pages of the Mirror and solicited interviews from TV crews all around the world, he had a rethink. If he could have the celebrity without doing any of the work, then why not grab at it? \"I am an actor in a way,\" he says. \"I play myself. I love the attention.\" </p> <p>Roberts points out that he has suffered for his art. He once broke his ankle while dashing naked across the set of the Reeves and Mortimer show. And when Chinese authorities in Hong Kong formed a human ring around him, they broke two of his toes with their boots. </p> <p>These incidents do not overshadow the triumphs of his career. There was the time he streaked across the This Morning weather island, jumping from Wales to Ireland and shaving years off the life of horrified weatherman, Fred Talbot, who tried to shield him with his clipboard. More recently, he made an uninvited appearance on the axed talk show, Vanessa. \"Oh my goodness!\" exclaimed the ruffled host. \"Get away! Could someone come and remove this idiot from the audience please?\" </p> <p>To date, he has streaked at 30 major televised events and run up more than \u00a32,000 in fines. \"It's money well spent,\" says Roberts, who is now looking for a sponsor to pay for him to streak at the Sydney Olympics. Well, he has always been a joker.</p>",

Its response to the trade and industry select committee's report on the events leading up to BMW's decision on March 16 to sell Rover is a model of self-serving, self-exculpating platitudes.

      "byline": "Rupert Smith",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Michelle Collins had no illusions about her role as an Oxfam ambassador to Brazil. \"Sadly, things have become quite celebrity-based\", she said in <strong> Michelle In Brazil</strong> (BBC1), with an understatement worthy of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. \"But if it takes someone like me to get people to watch, so be it.\" Collins was packed off to Recife, a big city in north-eastern Brazil, to meet the children who prefer life (and death) on the streets to poverty and abuse at home. She started off in brisk, matter-of-fact mode, but by the time she'd met Julio, an ethereally beautiful child, the only survivor of four brothers (one died of fever, two were shot by vigilantes), the fa\u00e7ade was slipping. Julio, like most of the street kids, was stoned out of his mind on glue, and faced the prospect of a short life and brutal death with solvent-based equanimity. </p> <p>For the parents living in the favelas, life was a long, exhausting round of anxiety and bereavement. Collins met and comforted one frantic mother, who waited every day for news that her daughter was dead, but was swiftly bundled out of the slum quarter as rumours of a nearby gunman sent residents rushing back into their huts. \"I feel sick\", said Collins, recovering in the back of the van. This was clearly not going to be one of those charity reports that harps relentlessly on the uplifting. </p> <p>Things took a turn for the better when Collins and her attendant press pack journeyed inland to meet the Xucuru Indians, who were living in a permanent roadblock in protest against the confiscation of their land. Marcinhos, the 21-year-old chief of the tribe, was blessed with film-star good looks and sported a covetable feather outfit, but calmly expected to be gunned down at any moment - just like his father was, two years ago. </p> <p>The show ended on a happyish note, with Collins playing football with the bright-eyed residents of a children's community based on a local farm, where street survivors come to kick glue and eat some decent food. \"This was my salvation\", said 16-year-old Oscar, who had lived through unspeakable horrors. \"Now I feel free, like a bird.\" Collins could barely tear herself away, and the rest of us were left holding our breath for this fragile moment of hope in an otherwise grim picture. Michelle In Brazil was a cut above its usually cheesy genre. Quite why the BBC1 schedulers hid it away at 11.20pm remains a mystery, particularly when the previous slot was occupied by something as hit- and-miss as TV To Go. </p> <p> <strong> TV To Go</strong> (BBC1) was a pilot, or \"one-off\" as we must call them these days, that rounded up some of the brightest comic talents around in the hope that they'd be even funnier in a group. We waited in joyous hope of laughs that just didn't come. All the performers - including Bill Bailey, Pauline McLynn and Hugh Dennis - have the proven ability to be funny just by walking on to the screen, but their material let them down. Jokes about mobile phones have to be pretty special to cut it these days - and these weren't. A promising sketch about supermarket loyalty cards went on too long, as did a joke about a church website. There were some fine moments - two dreadful holiday-makers boring the pants off a bemused barman by talking about car insurance, for instance, and a good joke about smoking rooms - but in a show like this you need machine-gun laughs, not the occasional chuckle. With a bit of fine-tuning, TV To Go could take on The Fast Show or even Smack The Pony. </p> <p>Anyone feeling in need of an antidote to euphoria - French football fans, for example - would have found the ideal prescription in <strong> Silence Of The Sea Lions </strong> , a grim offering from National Geographic. Remember those Disney wildlife films, where fluffy chicks made friends with baby lambkins? Well this was the exact opposite.

      "bodyText": "Michelle Collins had no illusions about her role as an Oxfam ambassador to Brazil. \"Sadly, things have become quite celebrity-based\", she said in Michelle In Brazil (BBC1), with an understatement worthy of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. \"But if it takes someone like me to get people to watch, so be it.\" Collins was packed off to Recife, a big city in north-eastern Brazil, to meet the children who prefer life (and death) on the streets to poverty and abuse at home. She started off in brisk, matter-of-fact mode, but by the time she'd met Julio, an ethereally beautiful child, the only survivor of four brothers (one died of fever, two were shot by vigilantes), the fa\u00e7ade was slipping. Julio, like most of the street kids, was stoned out of his mind on glue, and faced the prospect of a short life and brutal death with solvent-based equanimity. For the parents living in the favelas, life was a long, exhausting round of anxiety and bereavement. Collins met and comforted one frantic mother, who waited every day for news that her daughter was dead, but was swiftly bundled out of the slum quarter as rumours of a nearby gunman sent residents rushing back into their huts. \"I feel sick\", said Collins, recovering in the back of the van. This was clearly not going to be one of those charity reports that harps relentlessly on the uplifting. Things took a turn for the better when Collins and her attendant press pack journeyed inland to meet the Xucuru Indians, who were living in a permanent roadblock in protest against the confiscation of their land. Marcinhos, the 21-year-old chief of the tribe, was blessed with film-star good looks and sported a covetable feather outfit, but calmly expected to be gunned down at any moment - just like his father was, two years ago. The show ended on a happyish note, with Collins playing football with the bright-eyed residents of a children's community based on a local farm, where street survivors come to kick glue and eat some decent food. \"This was my salvation\", said 16-year-old Oscar, who had lived through unspeakable horrors. \"Now I feel free, like a bird.\" Collins could barely tear herself away, and the rest of us were left holding our breath for this fragile moment of hope in an otherwise grim picture. Michelle In Brazil was a cut above its usually cheesy genre. Quite why the BBC1 schedulers hid it away at 11.20pm remains a mystery, particularly when the previous slot was occupied by something as hit- and-miss as TV To Go. TV To Go (BBC1) was a pilot, or \"one-off\" as we must call them these days, that rounded up some of the brightest comic talents around in the hope that they'd be even funnier in a group. We waited in joyous hope of laughs that just didn't come. All the performers - including Bill Bailey, Pauline McLynn and Hugh Dennis - have the proven ability to be funny just by walking on to the screen, but their material let them down. Jokes about mobile phones have to be pretty special to cut it these days - and these weren't. A promising sketch about supermarket loyalty cards went on too long, as did a joke about a church website. There were some fine moments - two dreadful holiday-makers boring the pants off a bemused barman by talking about car insurance, for instance, and a good joke about smoking rooms - but in a show like this you need machine-gun laughs, not the occasional chuckle. With a bit of fine-tuning, TV To Go could take on The Fast Show or even Smack The Pony. Anyone feeling in need of an antidote to euphoria - French football fans, for example - would have found the ideal prescription in Silence Of The Sea Lions , a grim offering from National Geographic. Remember those Disney wildlife films, where fluffy chicks made friends with baby lambkins? Well this was the exact opposite. The sea lions of Alaska are dying out, probably because we have overharvested the waters of the north Pacific. But it was hard to empathise much with the creatures, as they routinely killed pups and slashed each other to ribbons. We watched in horror as one newborn infant was tossed around by a group of adults, and finally had its brains dashed out on the rocks while its mother bellowed impotently nearby. The absurdly portentous voice-over - \"Many Will Never Return!\" - was the final straw in a debilitatingly miserable piece of television.",

      "bodyText": "Poor performances from two heavily-weighted oil stocks and further selling of the battered banking sector brought to a close two days of strong gains for the FTSE 100 on Tuesday. With Wall Street shut for the Independence Day holiday, the FTSE 100 closed a quiet session 53.4 points lower at 6,417.0. The FTSE 250, Small Cap and TechMark indices all closed higher but gains were limited. BP Amoco, down 18p at 630p, and Shell, off 15.5p at 555p, were the main factors behind the weakness of the blue chip index. Both were unsettled by Saudi Arabia's pledge to begin pumping a fur ther 500,000 barrels of oil a day. BP also suffered from a downgrade from SG Securities, which cut its target price to 650p from a previous figure of 700p. Second-tier oil stocks were also out of favour after Dresdner Kleinwort Benson lowered its recommendations on number of oil exploration and production stocks. Worst affected were Lasmo, which fell 8p to 131.5p, and Enterprise Oil, which retreated 21p to 525p. The banking sector had another tough session following Monday's decision by HSBC to slash nearly 1% off its basic mortgage rate which continued to undermine investor sentiment. In the wake of that news, which many observers said could prompt a full scale price war, analysts at Deutsche Bank issued sell advice on Alliance &amp; Leicester, down 33p to 557p, Woolwich, 3p lower at 272p, and Lloyds TSB, off 14.5p at 604.5p. Barclays was also hit, giving back 60p to stand at \u00a315.90p. But Scottish &amp; Newcastle walked away with the FTSE 100's wooden spoon falling 39p to 489p as investors took fright at the full year figures and news that its core pubs business has struggled to make headway. On the upside, Dixons advanced 15.75p to 280p, as buyers moved in ahead of full year figures due today. Hilton shrugged off recent underperformance with a gain of 10p to 233p. Dealers said that a buy note from Deutsche Bank was responsible for the move. Lower down, Eidos shot up 45.75p to 538p on speculation that the French group Infogrames is set to pounce on the creator of the computer game heroine Lara Croft with a 700p a share bid. The biotech company Cambridge Antibody also shone, notching up a gain of 237.5p to \u00a332.10p after victory in a key patent dispute.

Despite this surprise, the industry is on track for a record level of deals by the end of the year. This means the bankers at the predominantly US-owned finance houses can also expect another round of healthy bonuses after an unprecedented wave of mergers and acquisitions by big companies around the world. Thomson Financial Securities, the media group which compiled the data, said that even though levels had fallen back in the second quarter such a momentum had built up for deals that activity in the next half of the year will not be knocked off track by \"jittery stock markets\". While the value of deals in the second quarter of the year took a 32% dive from the record $1.12 trillion (\u00a3741bn) in the first three months of the year - primarily because corporate finance activity slackened off in the US - when combined with the first three months stood at a record level. More than $1.88 trillion of transactions were recorded in the first half, a 26% rise on the already record levels of 1999 and 6% higher than 1998. Five of the top six deals which took place during the half were in media, telecoms and technology. Much of the slackening in pace in the second quarter followed a reduction in activity followed the jitters over dot.com stocks and larger and larger attempts to raise financing by telecoms compa nies. But activity in Europe remained as frantic as ever, with the value of deals reported at $298bn, barely changed from the $303bn over the first three months. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, topped the tables for all deals conducted across the world, closely followed by Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch. In Britain, the positions were reversed, with Merrill Lynch taking a 43% share of the mergers and takeovers conducted and Goldman Sachs taking second place. In a league dominated by US-owned investment banks, two European banks, Dresdner Kleinwort Benson and UBS Warburg, took third and fourth place, positions which would have been reversed if Dresdner had completed its planned merger with Deutsche.

      "body": "<p>Britain's engineering industry is hovering on the brink of recession and badly needs a further fall in the value of the pound below the critical level of DM3 to prevent new blows to investment and jobs. </p> <p>The Engineering Employers Federation said yesterday that sterling's recent fall - more than 10% since the high of DM3.40 in April and May - had happened just in time to prevent manufacturing falling into recession.</p> <p>The EEF's latest quarterly trends survey puts renewed pressure on ministers to give a clearer lead on joining the euro and on the Bank of England to signal that interest rates have peaked at 6% when its monetary policy committee meets today and tomorrow.</p> <p>Engineering industry executives voiced fears that the continued strength of sterling, which would be boosted by an increase in interest rates, would force more inward investors abroad and bring an even steeper decline in capital spending by British firms.</p> <p>The EEF's survey showed that, after three successive quarters of growth, engineering output had fallen - and not just in traditional metal-bashing.</p> <p>Old economy engineering firms have seen total orders cut back heavily, while electrical and electronic firms have also experienced slower growth. The steepest fall has come in the south-east, west Midlands and Yorkshire-Humberside.</p> <p>Stephen Radley, the EEF's chief economist, said engineering had still to reap the consequences of the high pound earlier this year but hoped for a \"bounce-back\" if the pound continued to fall.</p> <p>\"We expect the pound to fall further against the euro and dollar which will restrain any increase in the cost of imports, thereby reducing the threat of inflation , and this could lead to a revival of exports,\" he said.</p> <p>The EEF has consistently argued for the pound to enter the euro at a rate of between DM2.60 and DM2.80. But David Botterill, chief executive of the EEF's west Midlands region, said industry could now live with a higher level - preferably below DM3.</p> <p>He also pointed out that euroland interest rates were rising - closing the gap between the cost of borrowing in Britain and on the continent.</p> <p>Investment in engineering has fallen each quarter for the past two years and Mr Radley said any increase in the cost of borrowing would be unjustified by the inflationary prospects. Productivity in engineering, which was growing at 8% late last year, is now increasing at 6%. Earnings have risen by a little more than 5% with one in six firms reporting a pay freeze.</p> <p>Engineering has shed 25,000 jobs in the past year, the bulk of them in the past six months, and EEF leaders are braced for further losses as the Rover, Ford and Corus cut-backs take effect. Job cuts are the sole reason why productivity growth has been so strong.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain's engineering industry is hovering on the brink of recession and badly needs a further fall in the value of the pound below the critical level of DM3 to prevent new blows to investment and jobs. The Engineering Employers Federation said yesterday that sterling's recent fall - more than 10% since the high of DM3.40 in April and May - had happened just in time to prevent manufacturing falling into recession. The EEF's latest quarterly trends survey puts renewed pressure on ministers to give a clearer lead on joining the euro and on the Bank of England to signal that interest rates have peaked at 6% when its monetary policy committee meets today and tomorrow. Engineering industry executives voiced fears that the continued strength of sterling, which would be boosted by an increase in interest rates, would force more inward investors abroad and bring an even steeper decline in capital spending by British firms. The EEF's survey showed that, after three successive quarters of growth, engineering output had fallen - and not just in traditional metal-bashing. Old economy engineering firms have seen total orders cut back heavily, while electrical and electronic firms have also experienced slower growth. The steepest fall has come in the south-east, west Midlands and Yorkshire-Humberside. Stephen Radley, the EEF's chief economist, said engineering had still to reap the consequences of the high pound earlier this year but hoped for a \"bounce-back\" if the pound continued to fall. \"We expect the pound to fall further against the euro and dollar which will restrain any increase in the cost of imports, thereby reducing the threat of inflation , and this could lead to a revival of exports,\" he said. The EEF has consistently argued for the pound to enter the euro at a rate of between DM2.60 and DM2.80. But David Botterill, chief executive of the EEF's west Midlands region, said industry could now live with a higher level - preferably below DM3. He also pointed out that euroland interest rates were rising - closing the gap between the cost of borrowing in Britain and on the continent. Investment in engineering has fallen each quarter for the past two years and Mr Radley said any increase in the cost of borrowing would be unjustified by the inflationary prospects. Productivity in engineering, which was growing at 8% late last year, is now increasing at 6%. Earnings have risen by a little more than 5% with one in six firms reporting a pay freeze. Engineering has shed 25,000 jobs in the past year, the bulk of them in the past six months, and EEF leaders are braced for further losses as the Rover, Ford and Corus cut-backs take effect. Job cuts are the sole reason why productivity growth has been so strong.",

      "body": "<p>Australia's prime minister, John Howard, yesterday took the opportunity of a visit to Downing Street to press Tony Blair for help in persuading British museums and universities to repatriate the remains of more than 2,000 aborigines.</p> <p>The bones were taken by British scientists from the 18th century up until the 1920s and 30s. The Australian high commission said yesterday that aboriginal organisations wanted them back because their ancestors would find no peace until they were buried in their homelands.</p> <p>Museums in Europe have been secretive about whether they have bones and in what quantities - some from lack of proper cataloguing, others fearing such requests from indigenous peoples; some custodians argue that the scientific value of the bones outweighs their cultural significance.</p> <p>Downing Street said that Mr Blair would give the request \"a fair wind\" but no firm commitment was made.</p> <p>The department of culture, media and sport said that museums were generally forbidden by law to return items, constrained either by their trustees or acts of parliament; however, the department drew a distinction between human remains and artefacts such as the Elgin Marbles which Greece wants returned. A change to the 1983 National Heritage Act would be considered.</p> <p>A decision could be announced when the culture secretary, Chris Smith, visits Australia for the Olympics in September. Aboriginal organisations have threatened to protest at the games, unhappy at the failure of Mr Howard's government to apologise for the treatment of their people over two centuries.</p> <p>Mr Howard, who saw Mr Blair at Downing Street, was in Britain to mark the centenary of Australia becoming a federation.</p> <p>Tony Eggleton, chief executive of the national council for the centenary of federation, said there were various bones round the country. \"We are not expecting miracles overnight. It would be a good gesture to the indigenous population to have them collated and returned. Having forebears remain overseas and unrecognised is painful for them.\"</p> <p>The remains would be buried in their homelands, and those that could not be identified could be placed in a shrine to be built in Canberra, if the aboriginal organisations agreed.</p> <p>Neil Chalmers, director of the Natural History Museum at Kensington in London, said the issue should be seen in context: the museum had 68m items, of which 20,000 were human remains from round the world. Of these 448 were from Australia.</p> <p>Some 340 of the 448 items were digits, leg bones, skulls and other parts, rather than complete skeletons, he said. Australia estimates that between 15 to 20% of the remains in Britain are identifiable, but Dr Chalmers said that those in the museum could not be traced to a named individual with known living descendants.</p> <p>He said some remains were known to have come from Queensland but the regional location of most of them was unknown.</p> <p>The parts were used to study human origins and evolution, human diversity, diet and disease. \"We can do this because we have the whole collection together,\" he said. Asked if the scientific benefits outweighed the cultural ones, he said: \"The scientific benefits are global in their importance.\"</p> <p>Dr Chalmers hoped there could be a way of reconciling the scientific and the cultural, with perhaps a sacred area in the museum or the remains being taken to Australia but being available for further scientific research.</p> <p>The law in Scotland is different, and museums and universities are freer to dispose of their assets. A spokesman for Edinburgh University said that its historical anatomy collection had handed over aboriginal remains to Australia a fortnight ago; they had gone to a university in Canberra until a decision was taken on where they went next.</p> <p>Over the past decade the university had returned eight moko mokai (shrunken heads) to the Maoris, nine Tasmanian aboriginal skulls, and a Tasmanian aboriginal hair sample.

      "bodyText": "Australia's prime minister, John Howard, yesterday took the opportunity of a visit to Downing Street to press Tony Blair for help in persuading British museums and universities to repatriate the remains of more than 2,000 aborigines. The bones were taken by British scientists from the 18th century up until the 1920s and 30s. The Australian high commission said yesterday that aboriginal organisations wanted them back because their ancestors would find no peace until they were buried in their homelands. Museums in Europe have been secretive about whether they have bones and in what quantities - some from lack of proper cataloguing, others fearing such requests from indigenous peoples; some custodians argue that the scientific value of the bones outweighs their cultural significance. Downing Street said that Mr Blair would give the request \"a fair wind\" but no firm commitment was made. The department of culture, media and sport said that museums were generally forbidden by law to return items, constrained either by their trustees or acts of parliament; however, the department drew a distinction between human remains and artefacts such as the Elgin Marbles which Greece wants returned. A change to the 1983 National Heritage Act would be considered. A decision could be announced when the culture secretary, Chris Smith, visits Australia for the Olympics in September. Aboriginal organisations have threatened to protest at the games, unhappy at the failure of Mr Howard's government to apologise for the treatment of their people over two centuries. Mr Howard, who saw Mr Blair at Downing Street, was in Britain to mark the centenary of Australia becoming a federation. Tony Eggleton, chief executive of the national council for the centenary of federation, said there were various bones round the country. \"We are not expecting miracles overnight. It would be a good gesture to the indigenous population to have them collated and returned. Having forebears remain overseas and unrecognised is painful for them.\" The remains would be buried in their homelands, and those that could not be identified could be placed in a shrine to be built in Canberra, if the aboriginal organisations agreed. Neil Chalmers, director of the Natural History Museum at Kensington in London, said the issue should be seen in context: the museum had 68m items, of which 20,000 were human remains from round the world. Of these 448 were from Australia. Some 340 of the 448 items were digits, leg bones, skulls and other parts, rather than complete skeletons, he said. Australia estimates that between 15 to 20% of the remains in Britain are identifiable, but Dr Chalmers said that those in the museum could not be traced to a named individual with known living descendants. He said some remains were known to have come from Queensland but the regional location of most of them was unknown. The parts were used to study human origins and evolution, human diversity, diet and disease. \"We can do this because we have the whole collection together,\" he said. Asked if the scientific benefits outweighed the cultural ones, he said: \"The scientific benefits are global in their importance.\" Dr Chalmers hoped there could be a way of reconciling the scientific and the cultural, with perhaps a sacred area in the museum or the remains being taken to Australia but being available for further scientific research. The law in Scotland is different, and museums and universities are freer to dispose of their assets. A spokesman for Edinburgh University said that its historical anatomy collection had handed over aboriginal remains to Australia a fortnight ago; they had gone to a university in Canberra until a decision was taken on where they went next. Over the past decade the university had returned eight moko mokai (shrunken heads) to the Maoris, nine Tasmanian aboriginal skulls, and a Tasmanian aboriginal hair sample. The university adopted a sensitivity to indigenous claims in 1990. Sally James Gregory writes: The extent and whereabouts of aboriginal remains in Britain is unknown.

With business going global, mobile phone costs are spiralling and one British company hopes to cut through the apparently arbitrary charges that mobile users encounter when they leave Britain. Mint Telecom, a small \"virtual operator\", hopes to hit the big time with its launch of a pre-paid global roaming service at a flat-rate fee of 85p a minute anywhere in the world. Adrian Wood, Mint Telecom director, said the mobile user is often unaware of the high costs of internationally roaming until they return to Britain and receive a copy of their bill. Charges for international roaming usually cannot be controlled by any of Britain's four operators - Vodafone, Orange, One2One or BT Cellnet - and if a mobile phone user has a dispute with the charge they have to take it up with the foreign mobile network operator. \"There's a tremendous move, we have found, in large corporations and in the medium-size business market to try and arrest these costs,\" Mr Wood said. \"We are very confident that we will achieve 400,000 subscribers across Europe in our first year.\" Mint Telecom claims it can save corporations up to 40% on international roaming charges on a monthly mobile phone bill. The London-based company is able to offer its cheap flat rate of 85p a minute because it has bought bulk airtime from 200 network operators globally and has coverage in 115 countries. Mint Telecom charges a flat 42.5p fee for mobile users when they are receiving calls outside their home country. The company has agreements, lasting up to 20 years, with those operators and has made its first bulk purchase of 155m minutes which it expects to last for three months. Once its subscriber base grows, it intends to boost this level of buying to 200m minutes a month. Mr Wood said the most popular part of Mint Telecom's service would be the pre-paid el ement so that large businesses know what they are paying for up front. In the British retail mobile market there are about 15m users on pre-paid contracts. The margin that Mint Telecom would make from its flat-rate fee was slim, Mr Wood said. A mobile user wanting to use the network would insert a Mint Telecom SIM card into their mobile phone before heading overseas. The user would then be roaming on the Mint network and could make a call which would be routed through one of its switching stations in either Switzerland or Iceland that allows for the distribution of its service. Mint Telecom owns 50% of the third GSM licence in Ice land and also offers its own portal for WAP-enabled phones. The portal delivers content to its users such as email, share prices, news, weather and sport. The company, which is owned by six private investors, is capitalised at about \u00a35m. The owners say they have pumped tens of millions into the company over the past four years, refusing to be specific as to the exact level of investment, however, because of confidentiality agreements. They are seeking a further $18m (\u00a312m) to $20m in the next three months from venture capitalists to develop further the infrastructure, sales team and web portal as it expands. The company employs 22 sales staff and has distribution agreements with telecoms operators globally to promote its service, having linked with European Telecom in Britain. Mint Telecom's success may well, however, depend on whether its prospective business customers accept the idea and marketing that its service is \"a fresh and new approach\" to mobile usage.",

The polls are moving, but the impression has frozen in Labour-supporting minds that William Hague is unelectable and that a second term is assured. There is no need to stand together because there is no credible threat to face. Tony Blair never tires of saying that the choice is not between this Labour government and the Labour government of your dreams, but between this one and the Conservatives.

While Mr Bush banters with crowds and reporters, Mr Gore earnestly delivers policy measures on everything from education and immigration to health care and military training.</p> <p>In past elections the courted voter was the \"soccer mom\", but this year it is the Latino family. Although the Latino vote accounts for only 6% nationally, in such crucial states as California, Texas and New York it is significantly higher.</p> <p>Mr Bush has been making a big effort with Spanish language commercials and much reference to his Latino sister-in-law, and polls of Latinos show the gap between the two men narrowing. He has also been pushed by Mr Gore into denying that he is \"anti-immigration\" and \"anti-education\", accusations which the Gore team hope will bring the newly powerful immigrant communities towards the Democrats.</p> <p>So this week both men will be addressing the national council of La Raza in San Diego, since 1968 the main Latino civil-rights organisation in the US, and one whose approval a candidate must win if he is to activate the large but slumbering Latino vote.</p> <p>Looking very Anglo in his suit, white shirt and red tie, Mr Gore does his best to let the audience know that there is a little Latin in his soul. His speech is punctuated with enough \" felicidades \" and \" si, se puedes \" and \" de nadas \" to let them know that both his heart and his phrase book are in the right place. And he knows which buttons to press for standing ovations.</p> <p>\"All of America can learn from the Latino community about the importance of family,\" he tells them. Praising the family to a Latino audience is like telling the British voter that dogs are nice little fellows but Mr Gore is anxious to reassure his constituency before he takes questions from the crowd.</p> <p>\"I honour all the parents who read to their children at night,\" he says. \"My wife Tipper and I have done that to each of our four children.\"</p> <p>He is a grandfather, he explains, who has just celebrated his 30th wedding anniversary. How many here have celebrated 30 years of marriage? Since a long marriage in Cali fornia is around 18 months, this is not too fertile territory and the vice-president seems much more at ease when he is dealing with the weightier matters of health policy, the economy and civil rights.</p> <p>\"We have the lowest Latino unemployment rate in the history of the United States,\" he says. \"This is a time of pride and plenty.\" This week he has been outlining key reforms in medical insurance, pledging that by the end of his first term he would make sure that every child had medical insurance; currently one in four Latino children do not.</p> <p>He attacks the pharmaceutical companies for keeping their prices high and the insurance companies for their reluctance to pay up, subliminally blaming them for the poor health of Latino children.</p> <p>Then come the questions from the floor. There are a few lobbed pelotas . On funding for the arts? \"The arts are like air and water, we need them to lead good healthy lives.\" Affirmative action? \"I'm strongly in favour of it and Governor Bush is opposed to it.\"</p> <p>Then some younger Latinos ask some rather tougher questions. What about the 541 would-be migrants who have died crossing the border in the five years since the US started its get-tough Operation Gatekeeper policy?</p> <p>\"Every country has a duty to protect its border but it must be done with compassion, with respect for human dignity . . . If you elect me president, I will change that.\"</p> <p>A young man asks about the bombing tests on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques. \"I believe the bombing should stop as soon as possible.\"</p> <p>How many Latino faces would there be in a Gore cabinet, and when would there be the first Latino supreme court judge? \"My cabinet will look like America, it will embody the diversity of America.\"</p> <p>The reception is friendly and enthusiastic if not ecstatic. Yes, seems to be the answer, they would like to dance but they are still not entirely certain whether Mr Gore is going to stand on their toes.</p> <p>Gilberto Moreno, from Houston, says, as Mr Gore disappears in a sea of shaken hands and flashing cameras: \"I think he did extremely well. I don't believe Bush will get the same kind of reception.\"</p> <p>Edna Esquer, 28, an activist in the National Association of Hispanic Nurses, is also impressed. \"He has improved ac cess to health care and he's very proactive. Yes, I think he will be able to persuade young Latinos to vote for him.\"</p> <p>Outside, a handful of anti-abortion protesters carry placards of blown-up foetuses and a sign saying \"Liar, Liar, Pants on Fire\", while some Bush supporters discreetly hand out a leaflet mocking Mr Gore for being a \"suck-up\"' to the Latino community.</p> <p>Mr Bush, a Dallas reporter covering the conference says, has the greater facility in Spanish, but few past presidents have ever managed much more than an \" adios, amigos \" over a campaign burrito. One former vice-president, Dan Quayle, is still credited with having thought that the people of Latin America spoke Latin.</p> <p>There is more glad-handing to be done before Mr Gore is driven past the trolley-cars and palm trees to the airport for his plane back to Washington.</p> <p>As he leaves the rally with La Raza, Santana's Supernatural speeds him on his way. Right now, Mr Gore would probably settle for just plain natural.</p> <p>But at least he was present at a vast gathering of Latinos who cheered loudly when the Californian lieutenant governor, Cruz Bustamente, welcomed him as \"the next president of the United States\".</p>",

Tonight the second most powerful man in the land is going to ask them to dance, as it were, and how they respond will be seen as signalling which way the country's fastest growing ethnic minority will vote in this November's presidential election. Traditionally the Latino vote has gone to the Democrats, but Al Gore, trailing George W Bush in most polls, knows he can take nothing for granted. Most recent national surveys have shown him behind Mr Bush. Nevertheless, his team are heartened by the latest Newsweek poll, which shows him ahead of Bush by 46% to 45%, although dipping below his Republican rival if the Green party's Ralph Nader and his 6% is included in the equation. The poll encapsulates Mr Gore's dilemma: he must keep the traditional Democrat vote from the unions, ethnic minorities and environmentalists while reassuring the floaters that he is committed to a healthy economy. The style of the two candidates as the campaign enters its pre-convention stage is also a sign of how the race is running. While Mr Bush banters with crowds and reporters, Mr Gore earnestly delivers policy measures on everything from education and immigration to health care and military training. In past elections the courted voter was the \"soccer mom\", but this year it is the Latino family.

So this week both men will be addressing the national council of La Raza in San Diego, since 1968 the main Latino civil-rights organisation in the US, and one whose approval a candidate must win if he is to activate the large but slumbering Latino vote. Looking very Anglo in his suit, white shirt and red tie, Mr Gore does his best to let the audience know that there is a little Latin in his soul. His speech is punctuated with enough \" felicidades \" and \" si, se puedes \" and \" de nadas \" to let them know that both his heart and his phrase book are in the right place. And he knows which buttons to press for standing ovations. \"All of America can learn from the Latino community about the importance of family,\" he tells them. Praising the family to a Latino audience is like telling the British voter that dogs are nice little fellows but Mr Gore is anxious to reassure his constituency before he takes questions from the crowd. \"I honour all the parents who read to their children at night,\" he says. \"My wife Tipper and I have done that to each of our four children.\" He is a grandfather, he explains, who has just celebrated his 30th wedding anniversary. How many here have celebrated 30 years of marriage? Since a long marriage in Cali fornia is around 18 months, this is not too fertile territory and the vice-president seems much more at ease when he is dealing with the weightier matters of health policy, the economy and civil rights. \"We have the lowest Latino unemployment rate in the history of the United States,\" he says. \"This is a time of pride and plenty.\" This week he has been outlining key reforms in medical insurance, pledging that by the end of his first term he would make sure that every child had medical insurance; currently one in four Latino children do not. He attacks the pharmaceutical companies for keeping their prices high and the insurance companies for their reluctance to pay up, subliminally blaming them for the poor health of Latino children. Then come the questions from the floor. There are a few lobbed pelotas . On funding for the arts? \"The arts are like air and water, we need them to lead good healthy lives.\" Affirmative action? \"I'm strongly in favour of it and Governor Bush is opposed to it.\" Then some younger Latinos ask some rather tougher questions. What about the 541 would-be migrants who have died crossing the border in the five years since the US started its get-tough Operation Gatekeeper policy? \"Every country has a duty to protect its border but it must be done with compassion, with respect for human dignity . . . If you elect me president, I will change that.\" A young man asks about the bombing tests on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques. \"I believe the bombing should stop as soon as possible.\" How many Latino faces would there be in a Gore cabinet, and when would there be the first Latino supreme court judge? \"My cabinet will look like America, it will embody the diversity of America.\" The reception is friendly and enthusiastic if not ecstatic. Yes, seems to be the answer, they would like to dance but they are still not entirely certain whether Mr Gore is going to stand on their toes. Gilberto Moreno, from Houston, says, as Mr Gore disappears in a sea of shaken hands and flashing cameras: \"I think he did extremely well. I don't believe Bush will get the same kind of reception.\" Edna Esquer, 28, an activist in the National Association of Hispanic Nurses, is also impressed. \"He has improved ac cess to health care and he's very proactive. Yes, I think he will be able to persuade young Latinos to vote for him.\" Outside, a handful of anti-abortion protesters carry placards of blown-up foetuses and a sign saying \"Liar, Liar, Pants on Fire\", while some Bush supporters discreetly hand out a leaflet mocking Mr Gore for being a \"suck-up\"' to the Latino community. Mr Bush, a Dallas reporter covering the conference says, has the greater facility in Spanish, but few past presidents have ever managed much more than an \" adios, amigos \" over a campaign burrito. One former vice-president, Dan Quayle, is still credited with having thought that the people of Latin America spoke Latin. There is more glad-handing to be done before Mr Gore is driven past the trolley-cars and palm trees to the airport for his plane back to Washington. As he leaves the rally with La Raza, Santana's Supernatural speeds him on his way. Right now, Mr Gore would probably settle for just plain natural. But at least he was present at a vast gathering of Latinos who cheered loudly when the Californian lieutenant governor, Cruz Bustamente, welcomed him as \"the next president of the United States\".",

The agriculture minister, Nick Brown, accused Mr Hague of \"anti-European extremism\" after the Tory leader held out the prospect of a unilateral ban on imports of EU food.</p> <p>His remarks were echoed by a senior pro-European Conservative who described the new Tory farming policy as \"barmy\". The cross-party criticism of Mr Hague came after the Tories unveiled a new set of policies, entitled Fair Deal for Farmers, which are designed to court the votes of farmers who have suffered a massive drop in income in recent years.</p> <p>In a provocative move, the shadow agriculture minister Tim Yeo warned that a Tory government would take retaliatory action against the EU over the beef ban by banning the import of European beef which fell below British safety standards.</p> <p>Mr Yeo also promised unilateral British action on food labelling to end \"misleading European labelling\". Speaking at the Royal Agricultural Show in Stoneleigh, Warwickshire, Mr Yeo underlined his Eurosceptic approach to farming when he rounded on the government for its handling of Europe. \"Britain needs a government and minister of agriculture who stand up for British industry in Europe,\" Mr Yeo said. \"The story under this Labour government has been one of consistent refusal to confront any European government or institution, however unlawful or damaging their policies,\" Mr Yeo said.</p> <p>His outburst was rejected by Mr Brown who launched a scathing attack on the Tory document. \"Banning imports would start a trade war, putting at risk \u00a36bn of British food and drinks exports to Europe,\" said the agriculture minister. \"Unilateral action on food labelling would undermine the legal basis of free trade in the European single market. All this shows that the Tories are more extreme than ever and have only one solution for the complex problems facing British farming: blame Europe.\"</p> <p>Mr Brown's attack was echoed by a pro-European Tory. The former Tory minister, who asked to remain anonymous, said: \"Banning imports which do not meet our high animal welfare standards is barmy. It is illegal and it would risk other British exports. These are the sort of ideas which are dreamt up in a pub at 2.30 on a Sunday afternoon.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government joined forces last night with pro-European Tories to lambast William Hague after he unveiled a blueprint for British farming which laid the ground for renewed confrontation with the European Union. The agriculture minister, Nick Brown, accused Mr Hague of \"anti-European extremism\" after the Tory leader held out the prospect of a unilateral ban on imports of EU food. His remarks were echoed by a senior pro-European Conservative who described the new Tory farming policy as \"barmy\". The cross-party criticism of Mr Hague came after the Tories unveiled a new set of policies, entitled Fair Deal for Farmers, which are designed to court the votes of farmers who have suffered a massive drop in income in recent years. In a provocative move, the shadow agriculture minister Tim Yeo warned that a Tory government would take retaliatory action against the EU over the beef ban by banning the import of European beef which fell below British safety standards. Mr Yeo also promised unilateral British action on food labelling to end \"misleading European labelling\". Speaking at the Royal Agricultural Show in Stoneleigh, Warwickshire, Mr Yeo underlined his Eurosceptic approach to farming when he rounded on the government for its handling of Europe. \"Britain needs a government and minister of agriculture who stand up for British industry in Europe,\" Mr Yeo said. \"The story under this Labour government has been one of consistent refusal to confront any European government or institution, however unlawful or damaging their policies,\" Mr Yeo said. His outburst was rejected by Mr Brown who launched a scathing attack on the Tory document. \"Banning imports would start a trade war, putting at risk \u00a36bn of British food and drinks exports to Europe,\" said the agriculture minister. \"Unilateral action on food labelling would undermine the legal basis of free trade in the European single market. All this shows that the Tories are more extreme than ever and have only one solution for the complex problems facing British farming: blame Europe.\" Mr Brown's attack was echoed by a pro-European Tory. The former Tory minister, who asked to remain anonymous, said: \"Banning imports which do not meet our high animal welfare standards is barmy. It is illegal and it would risk other British exports. These are the sort of ideas which are dreamt up in a pub at 2.30 on a Sunday afternoon.\"",

That's on top of the 20 or so that emerged in 1999. All of them are praying they'll be the next Spice Girls, while insisting that they're nothing like them. </p> <p>None more so than Girl Thing, who are on course to be 2000's biggest success - or else its most ignominious flop. Though most people were probably unaware of them before last month's debut single, Last One Standing, they've been \"in development\" for two years, working through a rumoured \u00a31.5m advance spend.

That's exactly the attitude that attracted little girls in their millions back in 1996. </p> <p>Last One Standing, co-written by the Spice songwriter Eliott Kennedy, even sounds brazenly similar to Wannabe, cleverly alternating playground-style rap and sweet harmonies. The Spices might take the lyric personally, too: \"It's the end of an era, the start of a new day... Forget everything you've heard before, no matter how many times you hear this, you wanna hear it some more.\" </p> <p>Just one problem - all of this presupposes that the public wants a carbon copy of the Spice Girls, and that's where, at the moment anyway, Girl Thing are going wrong. </p> <p>\"People don't want another Spice Girls. I think they underestimated the intelligence of their audience,\" says a publicist. The fact that the song wasn't playlisted on Radio 1 didn't help. And so, despite one of the most aggressive campaigns in teen-pop history, including a lavish press launch at the Eiffel Tower and a Smash Hits cover (a first for the magazine, which has never given a cover to a band that hasn't had a top-five single), Last One Standing entered the chart at a not very sensational number eight. Even a Top of the Pops appearance on Friday didn't keep it from sliding to 19 in its second week. </p> <p>\"The level of promotion demanded a top three at least, so the opinion is that it hasn't performed as well as it might have done,\" says Hugh Goldsmith, manager of rivals Atomic Kitten. \"Ten-year-old kids have already seen the Spices once. They're hip to what's happening and aware they're being targeted.\" </p> <p>\"Obviously, not enough people wanted to buy the record,\" Cowell admits. \"Maybe it is a bit close to Wannabe. We wouldn't have released if we'd known there'd be such a backlash. But this record will probably sell 100,000 in the UK, we've gone in at eight, which is fine, and we're poised to put out a much stronger song for the second record [So You Want to Have Sex]. This is going to work for them.\" </p> <p>Girl Thing are just one of almost three dozen Spicealikes, and would-be fans are shunning all of them. Recent chart positions of other girl groups aren't encouraging. Even B*Witched, the first girl group to have four singles enter the chart at number one, only managed a miserable 16 for their last record. Of the newer bands, only Daphne &amp; Celeste and Atomic Kitten have managed to get into the top 10, while the much-promoted Six Chix scraped in at 72. </p> <p>\"You're either alive or dead now on your first record,\" Cowell once said. \"If your first record doesn't go top 10, you've got a major problem.\" Under-performers such as Hepburn and 21st Century Girls (the latter are protegees of the ex-Spice Girls manager Simon Fuller) have already been dropped by their labels, along with the more successful Fierce, whose top-three single apparently cut no ice. </p> <p>It's a pop jungle out there, with more and more groups competing for the same group of 10 to 15- year-old fans, who must be pretty bewildered by now. Factor in the number of boy bands also hungry for the kiddy pound and it's no wonder that only the very biggest, such as Westlife and All Saints, are actually selling records in any numbers. </p> <p>\"In some ways Girl Thing are a test case,\" says the editor of Smash Hits, John McKie.

What worked in 1998, when Operation Girl Thing began, won't necessarily work in 2000. </p> <p>What pop needs is a new Spice Girls, yet a Spice Girls that's somehow different. Witness the growing support for R&amp;B soloists such as Jamelia and the black Irish teenager Samantha Mumba, whose first single debuted at number two this week. \"I don't think Samantha would have had the same impact if she'd been part of a five-piece group,\" muses her A&amp;R manager, Peter Lorraine.

It is a lovely image: a man coming home in his lunch hour simply to stare at one painting. </p> <p>Many of the works he owned were huge, imposing canvases by William McTaggart which he hung in his stairwell - pictures of storm-lashed seas, children cowering in mortal terror on beaches being pounded by the wind and the rain. I remember climbing the stairs to bed and being frightened by them. But many of the others were works by the four Scottish Colourists - Samuel John Peploe, of whom I always think first, but also Francis Campbell Boileau Cadell, John Duncan Fergusson and George Leslie Hunter - and they are part of my childhood. </p> <p>My grandfather, who was always keen to promote living artists, staged an unprecedented exhibition of Peploe's works at Kirkcaldy in 1928.

They probably did not understand in what high regard they would be held today. </p> <p>It is their great commitment to light that impresses me the most. As others have written, the term \"colourist\" is a strange one and it is the light, rather than the colour, that hits you first. Their paintings of Royan and the other French towns they visited exude a tremendous feel of light and heat; whether it is the cold, white light of a beach in Iona or the brilliant, dazzling light of Antibes. That said, there is also a tremendous imagination in their risk-taking with colour: a shadow might be painted counterintuitively orange; the side of a ship outlined in bright colours - bold colours that are most imposing when the paintings are viewed from a distance. </p> <p>These are pictures that lift the heart - I can never remember being depressed by any of the Colourists' paintings. Especially compared with McTaggart, the Colourists have an enormous amount of humour, particularly when they're painting Paris - there's always something humorous about the way the ladies are sitting, or the portrayal of the French waiter, with his apron and his bouteilles de vin. Even the still lifes are, generally speaking, positive: these are not portrayals of decay but a celebration of life. </p> <p>But perhaps the most important factor explaining the Colourists' popularity today is that they are approachable: they do not require an enormous amount of interpretation. And they are in profusion.

A hastily formed coalition of company officers and directors were planning to oust Pixelon's founder and chairman, Michael Fenne. They had called the police because they worried Fenne - a big man weighing in at 350lbs - might turn violent.</p> <p>From the start, Fenne - who was partial to signing his emails \"Big Giant Head of Pixelon\" - had proven a highly unusual founder. He had demanded that he be paid out of the company's expense account, and displayed a tyrannical and bizarre management style, requiring some employees to work 36-hour shifts and holding a mandatory prayer meeting in his office. But the final straw had come when the company's investors learned that Pixelon had spent $16m (\u00a310.8m) of a recently agreed $20m (\u00a313.6m) round of financing on a star-studded launch party. Lee Wiskowski - chairman of Advanced Equities, the Chicago investment bank that had handled the financing, and a Pixelon director - had hastened to company headquarters for an emergency board meeting.</p> <p>The first thing Wiskowski and his two companions heard when they arrived was the sound of Fenne's voice over the Pixelon public address system. \"This is the master speaking,\" at least a half dozen people present remember Fenne barking. \"George better respond to me immediately, and if he doesn't have all the answers I might have to take him out behind the barn for a whooping!\" Another message rang out: \"Frank, report to the woodshed, your uncle is going to give you a whooping.\" The messages might have been funny - were it not for the air of fear they created.</p> <p>Later that morning, a Pixelon executive briefed Wiskowski's group. A week or two earlier, the executive told them, he had walked into Fenne's office for a meeting to find another executive on his hands and knees with his head bowed before Fenne, who was sitting in a chair with his hands on the man's head. \"I've never been around a cult leader, but that's the way it felt,\" the executive told the team. \"This feels weird,\" one member of the group planning to remove Fenne from the board remembers confiding to another. \"This feels like someone could die tonight.\"</p> <p>Only later, after Fenne was given the boot and the company was struggling to regain its footing, would the full truth emerge: Michael Fenne, the charismatic man who raised more than $28m (\u00a319m) for his venture, was in fact David Kim Stanley, a convicted con artist and fugitive on the run since 1996. Born in the poor rural south, the son and grandson of Appalachian preachers, Stanley had used his status and a near-hypnotic speaking style to fleece his impoverished neighbours out of more than a million dollars. In 1989 Stanley pleaded guilty to more than 50 fraud-related charges; a judge sentenced him to 36 years in prison and agreed to suspend all but eight if Stanley repaid his victims. In early 1996, having paid back only a fraction of the money, Stanley vanished.</p> <p>He turned up in the sleepy town of San Juan Capistrano in late 1996, just as the internet was transforming the most unlikely people into overnight multimillionaires. His weight, once a fit 220lbs, had ballooned to more than 350lbs. He and his new wife Sheila lived out of their Hyundai and showered at a nearby beach; he told locals that Sheila had recently escaped a Mormon cult that was bent on getting her back. A letter he wrote to his former wife - who had refused to go on the run with him - gives a sense of his plans for his new life. \"It has always been, and always will be, a mistake to lose faith and underestimate me,\" Stanley wrote. \"God has blessed me with a unique ability to defy reality.\"</p> <p>Stanley set up a fledgling computer business, Restec, whose clients, he said, included the Saudi royal family. Some of his Restec customers eventually asked him if there was a way to replay races at the local horse track over a computer so that people in other locations could place bets. Stanley told them their inquiry had caused him to stumble on a totally new way of playing high-quality video over everyday computers. By the middle of 1997, Stanley, Chuck Hauswirth - the owner of a \"tele-business centre\" who had leased office space to Stanley in return for a cut of Restec - and two associates had founded Digital Motion Video.</p> <p>Pulling video off a television and turning it into a file that can be played over a computer is no small feat, and this was even more true in 1997. The amount of information carried in the typical video is so vast that it would take a day or more to download a 30-minute sitcom. But in less than a year's time, Digital Motion had come up with video that seemed on the cutting edge, producing large images with the size and fluidity of television.</p> <p>Soon, Stanley was pitching his plan to launch a 1,000-channel internet broadcasting empire that would rival anything that CBS or Disney could ever build. His first crop of takers included a psychologist, the owner of a tile company and a local insurance agent. Each invested between $50,000 and $125,000. And thus was born Future Link Communications, later renamed Pixelon.</p> <p>By the spring of 1999, Pixelon was giving every impression of being well on its way to going public within the next year. The company struck an exclusive deal with Paramount Pictures to make web versions of its trailers for the upcoming movie, Star Trek: Insurrection, and forged a similar pact with Will Smith to make his Wild Wild West video available over the web in Pixelon's format. It was against this backdrop that Lee Wiskowski, whose investment bank Advanced Equities was looking for its first hot deal, met Pixelon on a Saturday morning in May 1999.</p> <p>Stanley rattled off the usual litany of his former employers, which included the CIA, Walt Disney and Sony. He showed them the Will Smith video. The financiers were impressed, and Pixelon agreed to make the firm its agent for a $20m private placement - a method of raising money from wealthy individuals - that would later rise to $28m.</p> <p>But while Pixelon's backers were gloating, employees inside the company were growing suspicious. Gary Devore, a video-encoding engineer, says he had suspicions about the technology, but didn't fully appreciate the deception until mid-August, when Stanley claimed Pixelon was using its proprietary technology to broadcast highlights of the Iowa Straw Poll - the bellwether vote of the US presidential race - live over the internet. When Devore reported to work that day, he discovered Pixelon was actually using Microsoft's Windows Media Player - the very technology Stanley so often cast as inferior - to broadcast the event.</p> <p>Stanley, meanwhile, was becoming increasingly tyrannical and abusive. One Sunday in August, he instructed all employees to meet in his office for what was described as a worship service. At the meeting, held in near-darkness, Stanley played a piano and sang a hymn he said he had written. His wife sat close by, wiping tears from her eyes.</p> <p>Devore says he went along with it partly because he still had hopes of becoming rich when Pixelon went public. \"Michael would say in meetings that everybody in this company is going to be a millionaire in a short period of time. The mania [was] the glue that kept the dysfunctional family together.\"</p> <p>Until autumn last year, the drama unfolding inside Pixelon was a carefully kept secret - and it would probably have remained that way were it not for iBash 99, Pixelon's extravagant launch party. Held at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on October 29, the day-long extravaganza included a reunion by the Who and performances by the Dixie Chicks, Faith Hill, Tony Bennett, and Kiss. The idea was to get Pixelon's name in front of all kinds of people, from stockbrokers addicted to classic rock to senior citizens who liked lounge crooning. The event would provide the perfect opportunity for Pixelon to showcase its unique ability to broadcast high-quality video live over the internet.</p> <p>But it never happened that way. Despite spectacular performances, Pixelon was unable to broadcast the event live using the very technology the event was designed to hype. The vast majority of footage never made it online. And, worse than being a public relations disaster, iBash turned into a financial black hole that largely sank Pixelon's chances of ever getting off the ground. For their efforts, the Who received $2m (\u00a31.3m) in cash and a generous offering of stock. LeAnn Rimes made $1m (\u00a3686,000). The Dixie Chicks got $875,000 (\u00a3595,000) and at least $230,000 (\u00a3156, 500) in stock. All told, iBash cost more than $16.2m (\u00a311m) - more than 75% of the capital Pixelon had taken in during its year and a half of existence.</p> <p>As that November day wore on, Wiskowski and others who wanted to oust him worried that Stanley - who was clearly unhappy about their visit - might erupt if he learned of the plan. They decided to get him into the conference room and that Robert Feldman, a recently hired Pixelon employee, would keep an eye on the room from outside through a window. If the plotters thought Stanley was about to go ballistic, one of them would gesture to Feldman with a thumbs down, the agreed-upon signal for him to call the police.</p> <p>As the group attempted to meet again with Stanley, they encountered a new problem: posted outside his office were two large bodyguards, and word around the office was that they were armed. Wiskowski and a colleague walked past the guards and entered the office. Sensing he was close to being ousted, Stanley suddenly was in a mood to bargain.</p> <p>\"Give me 90 days and I'll turn the company around,\" he told them. Cam Fraser, another new Pixelon executive, approached the office door and asked the bodyguards to leave. They refused. As nonchalantly as he could, Wiskowski feigned a yawn and a stretch, clasping his fingers together and turning his hands so that his two thumbs were clearly pointing downward. Within a half hour, squad cars arrived and removed the bodyguards peaceably.</p> <p>The three Advanced Equities principals remained in Stanley's office trying to coax him into the conference room. By nightfall the board meeting finally got into gear. Wiskowski smacked his palm on the table and made a motion that Stanley be suspended for 30 days. \"You betrayed me,\" one meeting participant remembers a clearly stunned-looking Stanley saying. Interim chief executive Paul Ward seconded the motion before Wiskowski had a chance to respond. Stanley was even more shocked. \"Now I know who my Judas is,\" he said. Stanley's reign at Pixelon was over.</p> <p>Almost immediately, however, it became clear that the drama was not over. Soon after the board meeting, word circulated in Pixelon's inner circles that someone had found a document on Stanley's computer laying out a detailed plan to leave the country in the event an unidentified \"they\" discovering his con. The letter discusses using hair dye and coloured contact lenses to create a new identity and eventually re-entering the country. \"I would only do this after a face change through plastic surgery.\"</p> <p>Stanley wasted no time rising from the ashes of his failed company, buying a house in Big Bear City, California, and setting up several new companies. But then, in early April, he got the call he had dreaded for four years. A disgruntled associate from one of his earlier San Juan Capistrano ventures had spotted a picture of David Kim Stanley, one of Virginia's 12 most-wanted fugitives, and thought it looked a lot like the man called Michael Fenne. A few days later, as San Bernardino sheriff's deputies moved to take custody of Stanley, they found only his empty house, clearly vacated in a hurry.</p> <p>In May, Pixelon laid off its remaining employees; the last executives were fired last week and a replacement board appointed. Stanley, who turned himself in, now sits in Wise County jail in Virginia, where he is being held pending a hearing in which a prosecutor will demand that he finally serves the prison sentence he received more than a decade ago.</p> <p>Nobody knows for sure if he was simply good at concealing a fortune in ill-gotten gains or simply lied and cheated for sport and revenge. What is clear is that he believes he has done nothing wrong, sees great things in his future and, when he gets out of jail, plans to finish what he started at Pixelon.</p> <p>\"In running for my life, I found my life in technology,\" says Stanley, who likes to remind people of all he was able to accomplish at Pixelon without so much as a social security number. \"When I'm operational again, whenever that will be, without the chains and limitations of being underground, I am going to build that network.\"</p> <p>\u0095 A longer version of this article is published in the Industry Standard magazine and is available online at <a href=\"http://www.thestandard.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.thestandard.com</a> A European edition of the Industry Standard will be launched this autumn</p>",

      "bodyText": "Late in the afternoon of November 12 last year, several squad cars from the Orange County sheriff's department converged on San Juan Capistrano in California, home of Pixelon, a high-profile internet company selling a new way of broadcasting television-quality video over the internet. A hastily formed coalition of company officers and directors were planning to oust Pixelon's founder and chairman, Michael Fenne. They had called the police because they worried Fenne - a big man weighing in at 350lbs - might turn violent. From the start, Fenne - who was partial to signing his emails \"Big Giant Head of Pixelon\" - had proven a highly unusual founder. He had demanded that he be paid out of the company's expense account, and displayed a tyrannical and bizarre management style, requiring some employees to work 36-hour shifts and holding a mandatory prayer meeting in his office. But the final straw had come when the company's investors learned that Pixelon had spent $16m (\u00a310.8m) of a recently agreed $20m (\u00a313.6m) round of financing on a star-studded launch party. Lee Wiskowski - chairman of Advanced Equities, the Chicago investment bank that had handled the financing, and a Pixelon director - had hastened to company headquarters for an emergency board meeting. The first thing Wiskowski and his two companions heard when they arrived was the sound of Fenne's voice over the Pixelon public address system. \"This is the master speaking,\" at least a half dozen people present remember Fenne barking. \"George better respond to me immediately, and if he doesn't have all the answers I might have to take him out behind the barn for a whooping!\" Another message rang out: \"Frank, report to the woodshed, your uncle is going to give you a whooping.\" The messages might have been funny - were it not for the air of fear they created. Later that morning, a Pixelon executive briefed Wiskowski's group.

      "body": "<p>Adecade separates the first documentary about excessive behaviour in Ibiza, A Short Film About Chilling, and the latest, The Dog's Balearics. Comparison of the two titles is enough to tell one how perceptions of the island have changed: the first was a pun on a cultish Polish arthouse film of the time, Kieslowski's A Short Film About Killing. The latest is simply a way of saying bollocks. </p> <p>I must confess a certain rave snobbery about Ibiza. I travelled to the island for three consecutive summers: 1985 to 1987. A Short Film... was shot by A Man Called Adam in the early 90s, documenting the aftermath of the torrential downpoar of ecstasy pills on the island. </p> <p>Ibiza had been a secret haven of excess since the early 60s - first as a hippy hang-out, then as a gay holiday capital of Europe. The island developed a Bacchanalian reputation, based on the illicit good times enjoyed by gay holiday-makers (especially Spanish gay men, free from the mainland constrictions of Franco's regime). It was this reputation - and the extraordinarily camp venues - which provided the basis for the club explosion of the mid-80s. </p> <p>The first time I went to Ibiza, my jaw hit the floor. I simply could not believe how outrageously licentious the island was, particularly the open use of drugs. It was a fantastic contrast to pre-Acid House England, still nursing a warm pint of lager. </p> <p>By 1987, people were already saying Ibiza was over (not the first and certainly not the last generation of Ibiza-goers to make this bitter observation). The secret was out, everyone wanted a piece of the action: one morning, I went into the sea and cut my foot on a broken bottle of poppers. The beach was littered with them. </p> <p>The island portrayed in The Dog's Balearics is just as jaw-dropping as the Ibiza of A Short Film..., but for a different reason. Now it is a giant Club 18-30 camp on E. Perfect, in other words, television entertainment. </p> <p>Conspiracy theorists could justifiably look upon Ibiza (or Ibeefa, as it was rechristened by the English) less as an island than as a Truman Show-style TV experiment. </p> <p>How else could one account for the creating of this ultimate TV studio in the middle of the Mediterranean? Half-a-million handpicked studio guests, returning each year to perform lewd acts upon one another (and the production team doesn't even have to ply them with drugs - they do it themselves). </p> <p>The problem with a programme like The Dog's Balearics, 15 years down the line, is not so much the rehashing of content, as the touchingly dated style. A step back to a time before the ground was rehashed so splendidly by Ibiza Uncovered. </p> <p>When Sky produced Ibiza Uncovered, no one believed it was going to be anything but the same pap. No one certainly expected such a genius piece of satire, upending the long-held clich\u00e9 that Ibeefa was still glamorous, even - gulp - worth visiting. </p> <p>Uncovered showed the island for what it had become: a giant vomitarium inhabited by lobotomised teenagers and reptilian club promoters. Sky may have been hoping for Human Traffic-meets-Trainspotting-by-the-sea. But they got Mike Leigh. </p> <p>In reality, Sky knew exactly what they were doing. Ibiza Uncovered, like its follow-up, A Bit Of Posh (about the hooray unwaged), was a conscious effort to up the channel's quotient of quality documentary. It was voyeuristic (of course) but it was just as strong on the cruelties of the club economy: the homesick dancer left waiting six hours in the sun to audition for a non-existent job. </p> <p>Channel 4 bought Uncovered, and followed up with Fantasy Island, about the Two-Step Garage scene in Agia Napa. The failure of Fantasy Island highlighted the problem of assuming that people dancing in a nightclub can always be treated in the same exploitative fashion as post-pub gawp fodder. </p> <p>Agia Napa is qualitatively different from Ibiza. The scene is more about fashion and music than getting blathered (plus Cyprus's police have a tough anti-drugs policy, which mitigates against mass oblivion). Anyone could have told C4 that it would make for very dull TV. </p> <p>Which leads me to the two basic ground rules for producing quality club TV, ie trash voyeurism: </p> <p>a) The programme-makers must surrender any notion they are filming something cool or happening (they must under no circumstances give a jaunty round-up of \"places to go\".) Stick to filming girls in platforms puking up into flower-tubs and you can't go wrong. </p> <p>b) If you must have a presenter, don't have a wry, slightly bemused comedian but a brainless clubber. By far the best club programme on TV remains Clubavision on Carlton, a late-night no-frills half hour in Hell, locked in a sweaty Essex disco with scary, incoherent clubbers and a busty blonde presenter called Janine. The programme is genius. It is beyond criticism and certainly beyond parody. </p> <p>Youth TV always fails when it attempts to be down wit' da kidz. It's best when it steadfastly holds the gap between the medium and the subject, ideally bringing the two into head-to-head conflict (Bill Grundy meets The Sex Pistols). </p> <p>In the 60s, Professor Hans Keller interviewed Pink Floyd.

      "bodyText": "Adecade separates the first documentary about excessive behaviour in Ibiza, A Short Film About Chilling, and the latest, The Dog's Balearics. Comparison of the two titles is enough to tell one how perceptions of the island have changed: the first was a pun on a cultish Polish arthouse film of the time, Kieslowski's A Short Film About Killing. The latest is simply a way of saying bollocks. I must confess a certain rave snobbery about Ibiza. I travelled to the island for three consecutive summers: 1985 to 1987. A Short Film... was shot by A Man Called Adam in the early 90s, documenting the aftermath of the torrential downpoar of ecstasy pills on the island. Ibiza had been a secret haven of excess since the early 60s - first as a hippy hang-out, then as a gay holiday capital of Europe. The island developed a Bacchanalian reputation, based on the illicit good times enjoyed by gay holiday-makers (especially Spanish gay men, free from the mainland constrictions of Franco's regime). It was this reputation - and the extraordinarily camp venues - which provided the basis for the club explosion of the mid-80s. The first time I went to Ibiza, my jaw hit the floor. I simply could not believe how outrageously licentious the island was, particularly the open use of drugs. It was a fantastic contrast to pre-Acid House England, still nursing a warm pint of lager. By 1987, people were already saying Ibiza was over (not the first and certainly not the last generation of Ibiza-goers to make this bitter observation). The secret was out, everyone wanted a piece of the action: one morning, I went into the sea and cut my foot on a broken bottle of poppers. The beach was littered with them. The island portrayed in The Dog's Balearics is just as jaw-dropping as the Ibiza of A Short Film..., but for a different reason. Now it is a giant Club 18-30 camp on E. Perfect, in other words, television entertainment. Conspiracy theorists could justifiably look upon Ibiza (or Ibeefa, as it was rechristened by the English) less as an island than as a Truman Show-style TV experiment. How else could one account for the creating of this ultimate TV studio in the middle of the Mediterranean? Half-a-million handpicked studio guests, returning each year to perform lewd acts upon one another (and the production team doesn't even have to ply them with drugs - they do it themselves). The problem with a programme like The Dog's Balearics, 15 years down the line, is not so much the rehashing of content, as the touchingly dated style. A step back to a time before the ground was rehashed so splendidly by Ibiza Uncovered. When Sky produced Ibiza Uncovered, no one believed it was going to be anything but the same pap. No one certainly expected such a genius piece of satire, upending the long-held clich\u00e9 that Ibeefa was still glamorous, even - gulp - worth visiting. Uncovered showed the island for what it had become: a giant vomitarium inhabited by lobotomised teenagers and reptilian club promoters. Sky may have been hoping for Human Traffic-meets-Trainspotting-by-the-sea. But they got Mike Leigh. In reality, Sky knew exactly what they were doing. Ibiza Uncovered, like its follow-up, A Bit Of Posh (about the hooray unwaged), was a conscious effort to up the channel's quotient of quality documentary. It was voyeuristic (of course) but it was just as strong on the cruelties of the club economy: the homesick dancer left waiting six hours in the sun to audition for a non-existent job. Channel 4 bought Uncovered, and followed up with Fantasy Island, about the Two-Step Garage scene in Agia Napa. The failure of Fantasy Island highlighted the problem of assuming that people dancing in a nightclub can always be treated in the same exploitative fashion as post-pub gawp fodder. Agia Napa is qualitatively different from Ibiza. The scene is more about fashion and music than getting blathered (plus Cyprus's police have a tough anti-drugs policy, which mitigates against mass oblivion). Anyone could have told C4 that it would make for very dull TV. Which leads me to the two basic ground rules for producing quality club TV, ie trash voyeurism: a) The programme-makers must surrender any notion they are filming something cool or happening (they must under no circumstances give a jaunty round-up of \"places to go\".) Stick to filming girls in platforms puking up into flower-tubs and you can't go wrong. b) If you must have a presenter, don't have a wry, slightly bemused comedian but a brainless clubber. By far the best club programme on TV remains Clubavision on Carlton, a late-night no-frills half hour in Hell, locked in a sweaty Essex disco with scary, incoherent clubbers and a busty blonde presenter called Janine. The programme is genius. It is beyond criticism and certainly beyond parody. Youth TV always fails when it attempts to be down wit' da kidz. It's best when it steadfastly holds the gap between the medium and the subject, ideally bringing the two into head-to-head conflict (Bill Grundy meets The Sex Pistols). In the 60s, Professor Hans Keller interviewed Pink Floyd. His first question was \"Why does it have to be so loud?\" Why indeed. It was a question worthy of Janine at her very best. \u0095 The Dog's Balearics, tonight, Channel 4, 1.30am",

Still reeling from the discovery that her three-year-old daughter Maisie was suffering from leukemia, Walters had to do nightly battle with the emotionally charged role of Serafina, the widow in Tennessee Williams's The Rose Tattoo who must free herself from the bonds of love before she can set her own daughter free. </p> <p>\"It was pure torture,\" recalls Walters. \"Playing someone in such torment on stage when Maisie was so ill was a mistake. Since then I've been offered some wonderful stage roles. But with my home situation I couldn't face them. If I'd have taken on another part like Serafina, I think my heart would have broken.\" </p> <p>The Walters heart is thankfully intact. Daughter Maisie is now 12 and has been pronounced fully cured. And this week Julie is back on stage playing Kate Keller, the mother at the heart of Arthur Miller's 1947 play All My Sons who refuses to accept that her pilot son is dead, even though he has been missing in action for more than three years. </p> <p>In the script Miller describes Kate as \"a woman of uncontrolled inspirations and an overwhelming capacity for love\". It could be a description of Walters herself: she chats away warmly as if I was a neighbour who has just popped in to borrow a cup of sugar, her conversation peppered with tangents, dead ends, indiscretions and a laugh that could crack crockery. With her scrunched-up face and tiny currant eyes she should be plain, but the mobility of her features makes her oddly beautiful. When she laughs her eyes twinkle like distant stars. </p> <p>The writer Alan Bleasdale, who first met her when she was working at the Liverpool Everyman in the early 70s, and remains a close friend, once said: \"Everyone falls in love with Julie Walters. She rubs off on people.\" </p> <p>From the moment Walters starred as the hairdresser trying to better herself in the 1983 film Educating Rita, she rubbed off on the nation's consciousness as the lovable girl next door who didn't mind sending herself up. On TV this led to parts such as Mrs Overall in Acorn Antiques and, more recently, the slovenly Petunia in Dinnerladies, written by another close friend, Victoria Wood. Walters has the knack of being ordinary. </p> <p>\"I am like Kate. I understand her desire to keep everything back as it was before - before the war and before Larry went missing. But she is not neurotic - she is a woman of enormous strength, the centre of that house and trying to hold it all together. So she finds things to hang on to, like astrology. The other day in rehearsal Howard [Davies, the director] was talking about 'all this nonsense about astrology' but I'm like that myself.

How could we have left the house where we were living, and how could we have stayed? I think the war made a lot of people feel like that. It took them a long time to learn how to move forward.\" </p> <p>Walters admits that she has had to be given a bit of a shove. After years of turning down job offers because they would take her away from home and a sick child, she now has no excuse. </p> <p>\"For a long time I'd calculate how much I could afford to stay at home, and do it as much as possible.

I didn't want to be on TV or be a film star.\" </p> <p>She is also honest enough to admit that she enjoys a little publicity. \"Once, when I hadn't worked for a while, Grant said, 'How would you feel if nobody ever recognised you again?' Of course I bristled and said that I'd never been in acting for the fame. But the truth is I would find it difficult. I'm a show-off. I am the kind of person that loves opening village fetes.\" </p> <p>Even leaving aside her daughter's illness, Walters's entire career has been defined by a theme of mothers and daughters. First there was her own mother, a driven working-class woman who pushed her children for success and was appalled to discover that her only daughter intended to become an actress. \"You'll be in the gutter before you're 21,\" she predicted. She never managed to tell her daughter that she was proud of her, although the book of press cuttings that was found after her death spoke volumes. </p> <p>Then there have been those defining performances, so many of which have been about parent-child relationships: Serafina struggling with the demons that threaten to taint her child's happiness; Fiona the daughter in Sharman Macdonald's When I Was a Girl I Used to Scream and Shout, who damages her own and her mother's happiness by deliberately getting pregnant at the age of 15; the repressed mother in the underrated film Intimate Relations, who makes such a fatal stab at sexual freedom; and the one in the TV series Jake's Progress who cannot love her own son. </p> <p>Now there is Kate, and in September she will be seen in Stephen Daldry's debut movie Dancer, now retitled Billy Elliot, playing a frustrated dancing teacher who neglects her own child and puts all her hopes and dreams into the small boy she discovers and pushes to become a ballet dancer. </p> <p>Yet somewhere between these performances, the long-ago knowing innocence of Rita and the ragbag of grotesques in which TV has so often cast her, there is another Julie Walters.

I think of this performance every time I see Walters on TV giving one of her comic turns in a show written by one of her friends.

      "body": "<p>Just about every other industry in Sheffield took a battering during the Thatcher years, and some disappeared from South Yorkshire altogether. The oldest of them, however, survived recession and has thrived in the new millennium.</p> <p>It is the bane of Steve Hicks' life.</p> <p>\"Prostitution\", roars Superintendent Hicks, his hands clasped tightly behind the back of his head, \"is one of our major problems.\"</p> <p>In its way, he says, it is more of a dilemma than drugs and violent crime (though prostitution is often linked to both), and a higher priority than burglaries or vandalism. Mr Hicks is not sure how many prostitutes there are in Sheffield. \"It's historic. Don't ask me why, but we have always had them. Street girls, call girls, massage parlours, escort agencies, you name it ... \"</p> <p>But he knows business is booming because of the number of kerb crawlers that appear on the street every evening, the number of used condoms they leave behind, and the complaints he receives about both.</p> <p>The police have tried all sorts of ways of controlling the industry. Some have been radical; they formally supported proposals to zone off pockets of the city, but the idea infuriated people living in the chosen areas.</p> <p><b> Nimby brigade</b><br> \"The nimby [not in my back yard] brigade had a point,\" said another officer. \"But if we had cordoned off certain sites for prostitution, at least that would have been one way of hiding it away and controlling it.\"</p> <p>Arresting and charging prostitutes, the police found, is a dispiriting and ultimately pointless exercise; to pay the fines, women need to work much harder, so they go straight back on the streets.</p> <p>Putting up a CCTV camera in one red light district, Devonshire Green, was supposed to deter prostitutes from working there. Instead, it encouraged them.</p> <p>This is, after all, Yorkshire Ripper country, and Devonshire Green, with its poor street lighting and industrial decay, is not the safest place for anyone to be walking around after dark.</p> <p>Knowing they were being watched gave the prostitutes extra security, so they huddled together in view of the camera.</p> <p>Mr Hicks argues that prostitution is a political and social problem. He says it needs \"multi-agency involvement\" - police speak for \"I can't sort this out on my own.\" He knows too that rows over tackling vice are significant because they are symbolic. They go to the heart of his strategy for policing Sheffield.</p> <p>Clarence Swindell, chairman of the police authority, thinks he knows the solution to cutting crime. \"I am 68 years old and I have seen a lot of changes,\" said Mr Swindell, a no-nonsense type who lives in Rotherham. \"And nobody will ever persuade me that the answer is not more uniformed officers on the street. People behave themselves when they see a police officer on patrol. It is a simple as that.\"</p> <p>Mr Hicks does not agree. He is in charge of one of the busiest city centres in the country. Between 150,000 and 200,000 people commute to Sheffield, and the central area a resident population of 100,000. Most of them would be surprised to learn the number of officers Mr Hicks has on standby to protect them.</p> <p>\"Fourteen, tops. That's on a good day, and we don't have many. Sometimes we have fewer than that, but I am not going to give you exact figures because it might give people the wrong idea. We don't want to cause any anxiety.\"</p> <p>Mr Hicks does not have the manpower to have police officers roaming the streets in a reactive way, waiting to respond if something happens. He favours schemes which shift or at least share responsibility, like using security guards rather than \"beat bobbies\" to patrol neighbourhoods.</p> <p>He sees the planned redevelopment of Sheffield city centre as a fantastic opportunity to \"design out crime\".</p> <p>Recently, he approved a pilot scheme to \"hire out\" police officers to Sheffield University, which wanted a uniformed presence on campus because students felt threatened by the number of prostitutes, pimps and kerb crawlers. The university paid for an officer to patrol Neverthorpe, in the north west of the city, between 5pm and 9pm every day for a fortnight.</p> <p>Mr Hicks persuaded the university to allow the officer to include in his walkabout a housing estate in Edward Street, where residents had complained about prostitutes.</p> <p>\"You could argue this means you don't have policing for all, just for those that can afford it. But this is the reality of policing today. The scheme made common sense to me, and the people who live in the Edward Street flats got a patrol.\"</p> <p>Mr Hicks has been promised extra uniformed officers, which should bring the overall strength on day shifts to 20. But this will not make any difference to the way the city is policed.</p> <p>To a certain extent, he is a victim of Sheffield's success. Crime rates have declined since the early 1990s, and the most recent figures confirm it is one of the safest cities in the country.</p> <p>The overall number of crimes committed in the city last year, 740, is still less than the 1997-98 figures, and the detection rate, 45%, is the highest in the force.</p> <p>Murders are infrequent. What violent crime there is tends to be drug related. Last month, a crack cocaine dealer, John Copeland, was jailed for 13 years for attacking elderly people in their homes, including a 94-year-old widower, Fred Revill. Another of his victims was an 82-year-old woman, Hannah Morgan. Copeland, 23, broke her hip.</p> <p>The police also have to deal with occasional shootings. Six weeks ago in Burngreave Road, three men jumped into the back of a car and shot a man in the passenger seat. The victim lost a lot of blood and suffered severe damage to his spleen, but survived.</p> <p>\"I would say that was probably drug-related too,\" an officer said. \"Incidents like that are few and far between. When I go to training courses and I speak to officers from London or Manchester, I realise we don't have anything like the problems they have.\"</p> <p>Perversely, drug culture has benefited the city, which has some of the trendiest nightclubs in the country.</p> <p>\"The dance crowd are very different from the pub crowd,\" said Detective Inspector Colin Fisher. \"The clubbers come to Sheffield for a weekend, and they don't stop for 48 hours. They don't cause any trouble. They are not interested in fighting or getting drunk. Twenty years ago, it was different. The culture was pub, curry house, and a brawl in the street.\"</p> <p><b> Drug deaths</b><br> Drug-related deaths in Sheffield are nearly always from heroin overdose, and often involve prostitutes.</p> <p>In recent months, Sheffield has reorganised its community policing teams to tackle vandalism and burglary. The impact was immediate.</p> <p>Officers work in fortnightly rotation; one week, they walk the beat, the second they join together to target hotspots like the Wyburn estate, often working undercover, on the trail of known offenders.</p> <p>In Gleadless, another problem area, crime went into freefall when the police set up a \"swat team\", made up of a sergeant, Dave Annakin, and three constables. They worked in conjuction with but were quite separate from the beat officers. During the team's spell in the Arbourthorne estate, crime fell by 28%.</p> <p>The trick was to identify the ringleaders, then arrest them in front of their friends. \"When it was made clear they were not untouchable, things quietened down,\" Sgt Annakin said.</p> <p>\"Every estate in Sheffield wants one of these teams now,\" said a city councillor, Robert Harpham. \"But there aren't the resources to keep them permanently.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Just about every other industry in Sheffield took a battering during the Thatcher years, and some disappeared from South Yorkshire altogether. The oldest of them, however, survived recession and has thrived in the new millennium. It is the bane of Steve Hicks' life. \"Prostitution\", roars Superintendent Hicks, his hands clasped tightly behind the back of his head, \"is one of our major problems.\" In its way, he says, it is more of a dilemma than drugs and violent crime (though prostitution is often linked to both), and a higher priority than burglaries or vandalism. Mr Hicks is not sure how many prostitutes there are in Sheffield. \"It's historic. Don't ask me why, but we have always had them. Street girls, call girls, massage parlours, escort agencies, you name it ... \" But he knows business is booming because of the number of kerb crawlers that appear on the street every evening, the number of used condoms they leave behind, and the complaints he receives about both. The police have tried all sorts of ways of controlling the industry. Some have been radical; they formally supported proposals to zone off pockets of the city, but the idea infuriated people living in the chosen areas. Nimby brigade \"The nimby [not in my back yard] brigade had a point,\" said another officer. \"But if we had cordoned off certain sites for prostitution, at least that would have been one way of hiding it away and controlling it.\" Arresting and charging prostitutes, the police found, is a dispiriting and ultimately pointless exercise; to pay the fines, women need to work much harder, so they go straight back on the streets. Putting up a CCTV camera in one red light district, Devonshire Green, was supposed to deter prostitutes from working there. Instead, it encouraged them. This is, after all, Yorkshire Ripper country, and Devonshire Green, with its poor street lighting and industrial decay, is not the safest place for anyone to be walking around after dark. Knowing they were being watched gave the prostitutes extra security, so they huddled together in view of the camera. Mr Hicks argues that prostitution is a political and social problem. He says it needs \"multi-agency involvement\" - police speak for \"I can't sort this out on my own.\" He knows too that rows over tackling vice are significant because they are symbolic. They go to the heart of his strategy for policing Sheffield. Clarence Swindell, chairman of the police authority, thinks he knows the solution to cutting crime. \"I am 68 years old and I have seen a lot of changes,\" said Mr Swindell, a no-nonsense type who lives in Rotherham. \"And nobody will ever persuade me that the answer is not more uniformed officers on the street. People behave themselves when they see a police officer on patrol. It is a simple as that.\" Mr Hicks does not agree. He is in charge of one of the busiest city centres in the country. Between 150,000 and 200,000 people commute to Sheffield, and the central area a resident population of 100,000. Most of them would be surprised to learn the number of officers Mr Hicks has on standby to protect them. \"Fourteen, tops. That's on a good day, and we don't have many. Sometimes we have fewer than that, but I am not going to give you exact figures because it might give people the wrong idea. We don't want to cause any anxiety.\" Mr Hicks does not have the manpower to have police officers roaming the streets in a reactive way, waiting to respond if something happens. He favours schemes which shift or at least share responsibility, like using security guards rather than \"beat bobbies\" to patrol neighbourhoods. He sees the planned redevelopment of Sheffield city centre as a fantastic opportunity to \"design out crime\". Recently, he approved a pilot scheme to \"hire out\" police officers to Sheffield University, which wanted a uniformed presence on campus because students felt threatened by the number of prostitutes, pimps and kerb crawlers. The university paid for an officer to patrol Neverthorpe, in the north west of the city, between 5pm and 9pm every day for a fortnight. Mr Hicks persuaded the university to allow the officer to include in his walkabout a housing estate in Edward Street, where residents had complained about prostitutes. \"You could argue this means you don't have policing for all, just for those that can afford it. But this is the reality of policing today. The scheme made common sense to me, and the people who live in the Edward Street flats got a patrol.\" Mr Hicks has been promised extra uniformed officers, which should bring the overall strength on day shifts to 20. But this will not make any difference to the way the city is policed. To a certain extent, he is a victim of Sheffield's success. Crime rates have declined since the early 1990s, and the most recent figures confirm it is one of the safest cities in the country. The overall number of crimes committed in the city last year, 740, is still less than the 1997-98 figures, and the detection rate, 45%, is the highest in the force. Murders are infrequent. What violent crime there is tends to be drug related. Last month, a crack cocaine dealer, John Copeland, was jailed for 13 years for attacking elderly people in their homes, including a 94-year-old widower, Fred Revill. Another of his victims was an 82-year-old woman, Hannah Morgan. Copeland, 23, broke her hip. The police also have to deal with occasional shootings. Six weeks ago in Burngreave Road, three men jumped into the back of a car and shot a man in the passenger seat. The victim lost a lot of blood and suffered severe damage to his spleen, but survived. \"I would say that was probably drug-related too,\" an officer said. \"Incidents like that are few and far between. When I go to training courses and I speak to officers from London or Manchester, I realise we don't have anything like the problems they have.\" Perversely, drug culture has benefited the city, which has some of the trendiest nightclubs in the country. \"The dance crowd are very different from the pub crowd,\" said Detective Inspector Colin Fisher. \"The clubbers come to Sheffield for a weekend, and they don't stop for 48 hours. They don't cause any trouble. They are not interested in fighting or getting drunk. Twenty years ago, it was different. The culture was pub, curry house, and a brawl in the street.\" Drug deaths Drug-related deaths in Sheffield are nearly always from heroin overdose, and often involve prostitutes. In recent months, Sheffield has reorganised its community policing teams to tackle vandalism and burglary. The impact was immediate. Officers work in fortnightly rotation; one week, they walk the beat, the second they join together to target hotspots like the Wyburn estate, often working undercover, on the trail of known offenders. In Gleadless, another problem area, crime went into freefall when the police set up a \"swat team\", made up of a sergeant, Dave Annakin, and three constables. They worked in conjuction with but were quite separate from the beat officers. During the team's spell in the Arbourthorne estate, crime fell by 28%. The trick was to identify the ringleaders, then arrest them in front of their friends. \"When it was made clear they were not untouchable, things quietened down,\" Sgt Annakin said. \"Every estate in Sheffield wants one of these teams now,\" said a city councillor, Robert Harpham. \"But there aren't the resources to keep them permanently.\"",

Mr Tan's plans to have pictures of the dead released to the Chinese community in Britain have met with little success.

      "bodyText": "David Tomlinson (Obituary, June 26) became a friend of mine 25 years ago because we both had sons of approximately the same age who suffered from autism. This became a central feature of David's life. Willie, his third child, exhibited the troublesome features of autism at a time when even less was known about the condition than is currently the case, and when diagnosis was extremely difficult to come by. David used his influence to gain publicity and funds for what was then the fledgling autistic movement, roping in friends from the theatre such as Ian Carmichael, Felicity Kendal, the Beatles, and, especially, Robert Morley. He made a television appeal in the 1970s, which raised more money than any other appeal had done up to that time. David and his wife, Audrey, were among the 20 or so families who helped to found Somerset Court, the first residential home in Europe devoted specifically to adults suffering from autism. Willie stayed there until relatively recently, when he transferred to another offshoot nearby. Like his father, Willie is skilled with his hands; he has his own workshop at home and has become an expert craftsman in wood.",

The design is based on boats, a reflection of Scotland's maritime history, and perhaps a poetic way of expressing his belief of a democratic government as a gathering of diverse ideas.</p> <p>Miralles was the Barcelona architect who most embodied the spirit of that city. By combining the characteristics of Catalan architecture - once described by Nikolaus Pevsner as being anarchic and, at the same time, filled with the serenity of economic structure - he broke every established rule of his calling, rearranging concepts to allow a fresh breeze to carry his imagination along new routes.

It would not be inappropriate - considering his projects and buildings - to suggest that he was on his way to becoming another legendary figure, like Antoni Gaud\u00ed.</p> <p>Like Gaud\u00ed, he had an enormous capacity to communicate, especially with his office team and collaborators, but also with his clients and constructors. His gentle charm, combined with an almost encyclopaedic cultural memory, won him the admiration of countless students where he taught, whether it was Harvard, the Architectural Association, Frankfurt or in Barcelona.</p> <p>Miralles had studied at the Escuela T\u00e9cnica Superior de Arquitectura in Barcelona, going on to complete his doctoral thesis on William Adam, Edinburgh's great 18th-century architect, at Columbia University, New York. He had earlier visited Edinburgh as a teenager, to learn English.</p> <p>But students only really listen to people who go beyond the academic and can actually manage to get an idea built successfully. In this, Miralles, for all his youth, could cut the mustard. Between 1974 and 1989, he was a rising star within the office of the Barcelona architects Helio Pi\u00f1on and Albert Viaplana. There, he was involved in the design of the Pla\u00e7a dels Pa\u00efsos Catalans, the square in front of the main railway station, which drew the attention of the world's architects to the new approach to the design of public spaces in this city.</p> <p>He qualified in 1978 and, in 1983, set up his own office with Carme Pin\u00f3s, his first wife, with whom he designed the cemetery for the town of Igualada. Completed in 1991, this project launched him into international fame. It was there that he was buried yesterday.</p> <p>These early works were more on the edge of architecture - as well as the Igualada cemetery, for example, there had been Barcelona's Olympic archery area and the pergola in the Olympic village - before he moved on to design his first buildings in 1990. These were a sports hall in Huesca and a gymnasium in Alicante. Although they both fitted beautifully into the landscape, they were somewhat chaotic, and wilfully aggressive in the abuse of structure. For a time, it might have seemed that Miralles was becoming trapped by his own ingenious and mysterious drawings.</p> <p>Fortunately, stimulated by competition successes (he won the bid for the Scottish parliament against four other teams), his later works showed an increasingly masterly control of his almost casual compositions. He was in the process of marrying his lyrical and poetic imagination to the representational character of institutional buildings, such as the Scottish parliament, the extension to the town hall in Utrecht, the school of architecture in Venice and the headquarters for the gas company in Barcelona.</p> <p>However, it is easy to understand that Miralles's heart was particularly in a project just round the corner from where he lived in the old medieval quarter of Barcelona. This was a project that the mayor had asked him to undertake - to replace the old market of Santa Caterina and its immediate surroundings. It was a challenge to find within the culture of our time an answer to the medieval street structure of the city. Fortunately, like the Scottish parliament, the design is far advanced, and his office will be able to finish the details. Yet, there will inevitably be something missing - the humour perhaps, which was an integral part of Miralles himself.</p> <p>Personally, I shall miss our casual encounters in the early morning, when we met cycling to work - our offices were almost next door to each other. We used to exchange brief comments on our respective projects. He was sometimes accompanied by his second wife and partner since 1993, Benedetta Tagliabue, and their children, Caterina, aged six, and a boy, Dom\u00e8nec, aged three.</p> <p>He was extremely fond of his family and had many friends, and, as a natural master, many pupils, who will continue to be inspired by his free approach to his art.</p> <p><b>Professor Andrew Macmillan writes:</b> Enric Miralles and I first met in the early 1990s, when he came to talk about his work to us at the Mackintosh school of architecture in Glasgow. He stayed on to look at the students' work, and to inspire them - and he came again and again.</p> <p>He enjoyed architecture, he lived at his most intense through it. He reminded me of Pavarotti, who stops and smiles radiantly when he knows he has done well, pleased with himself and sharing his pleasure.</p> <p>With Enric, you were with a mind that was never at rest, a man with poetic insight into the stimuli that produce form and meaning in architecture. I remember walking in the rain along the Crinan canal during one of his visits, when we came across a fish-shaped puddle. Look, he said, in my next cemetery I will make one, a permanent puddle. At that time, he had just completed two brilliant cemeteries near Barcelona - the Spaniards still take death seriously.</p> <p>In discussion, his deep interest in art, in the depiction of light and space, his readings in philosophy, his encyclopedic knowledge of architectural sources, historical and contemporary, revealed how profoundly his own work was based.</p> <p>His presentation to the selection panel seeking an architect for the new Scottish parliament building was always stimulating, challenging and, above all, poetic, with unexpected twists and yet astonishingly practical at the same time.</p> <p>As a Catalan, he had a sympathy with Scotland - he liked the land and its people. He wanted to give of his best to make its forum, its first significant public building, special - to the place, to the people, to its enlightened traditions.

Fortunately, architects work in teams, buildings are complex, and the personal involvement which is implicit in an atelier like that Enric operated and inspired - and that includes the new Scottish partners - means that dedicated, involved people can and will finish the parliament building.

The ruling of the European court of justice in Luxembourg has far-reaching consequences for other European Union countries, for it is the first time that the court has fined an EU member-state for refusing to comply with one of its judgments. \"We are stepping into new territory here. This is a landmark ruling and one of the most important judgements of the year,\" a court official said. The decision is also a sign that the court is ready to get tough with countries which flout EU law, and that is likely to give a glimmer of hope to UK farmers relying on it to overturn France's ban on British beef. The court ordered Greece to close the plant, on the island of Crete, in 1992. But opposition from the local authorities, who are loath to build a new plant near Chania, the local town, has prevented the order being obeyed. The ruling is highly embarrassing to the Greek government, since the court found that waste from military bases, hospitals and local industry was still \"thrown in an uncontrolled manner\" into a ravine just 200 metres from the Mediterranean Sea. The rubbish is constantly on fire and, every time it rains waste residues are swept into the sea and soak into the ground, damaging the environment. Greek officials admitted yesterday that the ruling was likely to damage their country's environmental credentials, but were at pains to pin the blame on the local authorities in Crete. \"They are like the Sardinians and the Sicilians,\" one official said. He claimed that the Cretan authorities had repeatedly refused to bow to pressure from Athens, but would now have no choice but to fall into line. \"It is an embarrassment for the country but it is something we're trying to improve,\" the official said. We will have to comply with the decision and we will be paying the fine. The fine is quite steep so we'll have to get our act together very quickly.\" Tourists should not, he added, be put off from visiting Crete,for it was still safe to swim in the Mediterranean. But the European commission, which brought the case against Greece, took a stronger line yesterday and argued that the matter was extremely serious. \"It is very serious because it is about waste and toxic waste and ultimately the consumer's health,\" a commission spokeswoman, Pia Ahrenkilde, said. The court's decision was a landmark ruling, Ms Ahrenkilde added. It would serve as a deterrent against other countries which might be thinking of ignoring EU law.",

The surprise move by the desert kingdom was seen as a sign of its willingness to please Washington at the cost of alienating its Middle East neighbours. Fearing that high oil prices could cause inflation and slow down economic growth, the United States has been pressing for action. But the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, representing the producers of 40% of the world's oil, offered only a modest increase in production, and that failed to move the markets. On Monday Saudi Arabia - the world's biggest oil producer and the only country capable of shifting prices single-handedly - came to the rescue, announcing that it would \"very soon\" increase production by 500,000 barrels a day unless crude prices - currently about $30 (\u00a320) a barrel - came down. Yesterday Kuwait and Qatar complained that they had not been consulted, and Iran accused the kingdom of violating agreements. The Iraqi oil minister, Lieutenant-General Amer Mohammed Rashid, denounced the Saudis for giving in to pressure from the US, where petrol prices have become an issue in the presidential election. The Venezuelan president of Opec, Ali Rodriguez, also joined the fray. \"Before Saudi Arabia takes any decision it is essential to hold consultations. Until now we have always taken decisions by consensus,\" he said In the US, Vice-President Al Gore immediately welcomed the Saudi move, saying: \"I want to call on the big oil companies to let that Saudi output increase pass through in the form of price reductions to the people who are filling their cars.\" Although oil producers have been enjoying a revenue bonanza recently, Opec regards $25 a barrel as a more reasonable level.

Their aim is to show traders the trend, because betting against Saudi Arabia is not a good idea.\" Oil prices fell from around $25 a barrel in 1997 to under $10 in 1999, mainly as a result of the crisis in Asia's \"tiger\" economies and mild winters in the northern hemisphere. Since last year, they have risen rapidly, partly because of collective action by Opec. But the rise has continued beyond Opec's target range of $22 to $28. The Iranians, in particular, blame the US for the most recent increases, saying they are due to factors in the American market rather than a shortage of global production. Refinery bottlenecks and anti-pollution regulations requiring different types of petrol have pushed up prices at filling stations. Meanwhile, stockpiles of oil acquired at low prices have been reduced to almost nothing, because companies risk losing money if they replenish them now and prices subsequently fall. One result of this, according to industry analysts, is that at present consumers have no cushion against a disruption of supplies from less dependable sources such as Iraq, Nigeria, Colombia and Angola. Because of UN sanctions, Iraq does have an Opec quota, but it exports just under 2m barrels a day through the oil-for-food programme. The bulk of this goes to the US and Europe.",
