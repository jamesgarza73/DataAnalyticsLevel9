Yesterday, in the shape of Jimmy Adams, there was honesty of purpose here in abundance. </p> <p>With the attention span of the average Briton now estimated at 15 seconds, Adams may drive half the nation to distraction by the summer's close. This is not an undependable sound-bite cricketer but a man of unshifting purpose and obligation. There has never been a more appropriate time to acclaim him. </p> <p>It took nearly four hours for him to reach his half-century, a period in which West Indies methodically squeezed the life out of England's bowlers, and faith was restored in test match verities. The main chancers, the deceitful and the downright corrupt, seemed a million miles away. </p> <p>Adams never actively sought the West Indies captaincy, and when he dutifully accepted it this year he inherited a shambles. New Zealand had just meted out a thrashing at test and one-day level and Brian Lara had resigned in such mental turmoil that he turned to a psychologist. </p> <p>Adams immediately offered Lara unstinting support. \"He is like a brother,\" he said. But these are two disparate brothers, as diametrically opposed as Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger in Twins: Lara flash, impulsive, capricious; Adams unspectacular, consistent, straightforward. </p> <p>West Indies are already proving remarkably difficult to beat under Adams's captaincy. \"There is a long road to travel and it will be travelled by everybody,\" he warned. It will not be a pretty route but one that is forever slightly uphill, consistently straight, and with few opportunities to stop and admire the view. </p> <p>In the first test under his charge, in Port of Spain, Zimbabwe needed only 99 for victory, and lost. In the second test, Adams's first test hundred for four years ensured a series victory. Another home series success against Pakistan then followed, achieved in St John's with a wicket to spare. </p> <p>It is impossible to shake up Adams. He cannot be bored out, talked out or conned out, merely bowled out. He survives with an inscrutable expression and unyielding defence. </p> <p>The crowd's patience never wavered, as if they welcomed a cleansing of the game's soul. One spectator in the Wyatt stand filmed him on a camcorder for most of the afternoon session and now is an expert on the art of the forward defensive. </p> <p>The dash had come in the first hour, as Lara and Sherwin Campbell sped along at five an over. It took Lara's dismissal, edging Darren Gough to the wicketkeeper, to break the momentum, although it was a surprise that it was Andrew Flintoff who applied the brake. </p> <p>\"Freddie\" is no bowling stylist. His gormless, galumphing run does not hint at guile. As his heavy frame pounded in, there was every chance that if cracks did not open up on the square then craters would assuredly appear on his run-up. </p> <p>But Flintoff stuck gamely to his task and bowled tightly - and just as quickly as Gough - at the left-handers from around the wicket. There was the bonus of Shivnarine Chanderpaul's wicket too, and even the honour of the second new ball. It lasted only an over, but he grinned broadly at it all. </p> <p>More honesty, more joy. It is just a shame that England broke their contractual agreements and were too gloomy to talk about it.</p>",

Another home series success against Pakistan then followed, achieved in St John's with a wicket to spare. It is impossible to shake up Adams. He cannot be bored out, talked out or conned out, merely bowled out. He survives with an inscrutable expression and unyielding defence. The crowd's patience never wavered, as if they welcomed a cleansing of the game's soul. One spectator in the Wyatt stand filmed him on a camcorder for most of the afternoon session and now is an expert on the art of the forward defensive. The dash had come in the first hour, as Lara and Sherwin Campbell sped along at five an over. It took Lara's dismissal, edging Darren Gough to the wicketkeeper, to break the momentum, although it was a surprise that it was Andrew Flintoff who applied the brake. \"Freddie\" is no bowling stylist. His gormless, galumphing run does not hint at guile. As his heavy frame pounded in, there was every chance that if cracks did not open up on the square then craters would assuredly appear on his run-up. But Flintoff stuck gamely to his task and bowled tightly - and just as quickly as Gough - at the left-handers from around the wicket. There was the bonus of Shivnarine Chanderpaul's wicket too, and even the honour of the second new ball. It lasted only an over, but he grinned broadly at it all. More honesty, more joy. It is just a shame that England broke their contractual agreements and were too gloomy to talk about it.",

      "bodyText": "Prince William, possibly Europe's most eligible bachelor, probably Britain's most famous teenager and certainly second in line to its throne, was yesterday pushed reluctantly into the limelight by Buckingham Palace in an attempt to head off what the royal family expect will be worldwide fascination with his 18th birthday next week. The palace released a selection of photographs of the prince at Eton, five minutes of film shot over several months by ITN and a staggeringly uninformative interview based on written questions submitted by the Press Association. Virtually nothing about the prince, his tastes or views, can be gleaned from his answers. William's birthday falls next Wednesday, when he will be revising for his history of art A-Level the following day. Asked how he plans to celebrate, the young man replied circumspectly: \"I haven't really thought about it, but no doubt I will celebrate privately with some friends.\" Royal watchers have claimed that, like many an 18-year-old, the prince had actually hoped to go to a London nightclub and had a row with his father over Prince Charles's plan to organise a ball for him at Highgrove instead. Now, it is said, he will have a party down the road from his school at Windsor Castle, with the senior members of the family retiring discreetly at midnight. Yesterday's heavily controlled media operation has already cost Sandy Henney, the Prince of Wales's press secretary, her job last week, for failing to nail down the copyright on official photographs securely. The pictures and the film show the prince at his computer, on the games field, in the school swimming pool playing water polo, looking pensive, cooking chicken paella and wearing various highly-coloured waistcoats, including one with a union flag under his school uniform to signify membership of the exclusive Eton prefects' society known as Pop. The ITN film contains his first recorded words - in answer to the question \"Can I just ask you, William, what you are preparing?\" - \"Paella with chicken, rice, garlic and beans\" and his first broadcast royal command as the dish starts to go wrong: \"Do something - quickly!\" He says that he has enjoyed Eton very much and will miss his friends and housemaster when he leaves, that he likes the uniform, especially the waistcoats and wing collars, and that he is planning to take a gap year before going to university. \"At the moment I prefer to keep the details private until all the arrangements have been settled,\" he says. He is planning to study the history of art, probably at Edinburgh University, but, asked whether he would like to study abroad, appeared flummoxed at the suggestion. \"I can honestly say I haven't thought about it; it hadn't crossed my mind,\" he said. The prince admits to enjoying a wide range of books \"but I don't have particular favourite authors\", to enjoying dancing, as well as team games like soccer and rugby, and to going to the local cinema when there is a good film showing: \"I prefer action films.\" The prince squashes media rumours about being linked to Britney Spears - \"there's been a lot of nonsense put about by PR companies. I don't like being exploited in this way but as I get older it's increasingly hard to prevent\" - and confides that his pet labrador Widgeon has recently had eight puppies. Asked how he copes with the attention of girls, he replied: \"In my own way. Trying to explain how might be counterproductive.\" Asked whether he has a girlfriend, he replied: \"I like to keep my private life private.\" One decided dislike however is the attention of the public and the media. He said : \"I feel uncomfortable with it ... The media have left me alone while I have been at Eton for which I am grateful.\"",

With only two or three props used in each act - a chair, a chest and a couple of classical doorways - the complicated story is made clearer than in the new Glyndebourne production, with fewer trendy distractions. One magical point is that the garden to the right of the audience becomes an integral part of the production. </p> <p>As so often at Garsington, the cast consists almost entirely of young singers with clear voices. The Icelandic Hulda Bjork Gardarsdottir is a bright, lively Susanna, while Franzita Whelan from Ireland is a maternal Countess and Peter Savidge a formidable Count, whose acting is superb.

Though this trivial piece, written for a royal wedding, seems painfully thin musically next to the Mozart masterpiece, the setting at Garsington makes it delightful entertainment, the more so because the endless recitative has been cut to size. </p> <p>The fantastic Goldoni plot revolves round the bogus astronomer, Ecclitico, (winningly played by Mark Tucker), tricking the doddering old Buonafede (Jonathan Veira) into believing that he has been transported to the moon. Michael McCaffery's production, with designs by Paul Edwards, offers a science-fiction setting, full of references to Star Trek and Star Wars, including a whole chorus of Mr Spocks.

During the long interval - caused by an unannounced bomb scare backstage - a fan explained to me that high audience numbers were less surprising than they seemed. Matchbox 20 are apparently on heavy rotation on MTV. So that was why the entire house rose to the first gravelly chords of Angry, from the new album Mad Season, and stayed risen through the dozen or so soundalikes that followed. That MTV magic was also probably responsible for the howls that greeted Thomas's jape: \"We were coming in from the airport and saw a poster for our new single, Bent, and we thought, damn, over here that's like calling it Poofter.\" </p> <p>There's not much to say about the music, which was warm, affable and as \"bland and faceless\" as promised. The tunes that possessed a smidgen of character were those that sounded like other people's stuff - If You're Gone, for instance, evoked Springsteen in ballad mode, while Crutch's chewable desolation was indebted to REM. If you hadn't heard either of those artists, you might think Matchbox 20 had uncovered a seam of yearning, old-style guitar rock that can hold its own against more fashionable competitors. </p> <p>But does anyone, including themselves, really think that these obviously nice guys are doing anything even vaguely original? </p> <p> Matchbox 20 play the Old Fruit Market, Glasgow (0141-287 5511), tomorrow.</p>",

During the long interval - caused by an unannounced bomb scare backstage - a fan explained to me that high audience numbers were less surprising than they seemed. Matchbox 20 are apparently on heavy rotation on MTV. So that was why the entire house rose to the first gravelly chords of Angry, from the new album Mad Season, and stayed risen through the dozen or so soundalikes that followed. That MTV magic was also probably responsible for the howls that greeted Thomas's jape: \"We were coming in from the airport and saw a poster for our new single, Bent, and we thought, damn, over here that's like calling it Poofter.\" There's not much to say about the music, which was warm, affable and as \"bland and faceless\" as promised. The tunes that possessed a smidgen of character were those that sounded like other people's stuff - If You're Gone, for instance, evoked Springsteen in ballad mode, while Crutch's chewable desolation was indebted to REM. If you hadn't heard either of those artists, you might think Matchbox 20 had uncovered a seam of yearning, old-style guitar rock that can hold its own against more fashionable competitors. But does anyone, including themselves, really think that these obviously nice guys are doing anything even vaguely original? Matchbox 20 play the Old Fruit Market, Glasgow (0141-287 5511), tomorrow.",

Voting forms have been dropping on doormats over the past few days, and if they give the go-ahead, B&amp;B members can expect windfalls averaging \u00a3731. </p> <p>The Widows announcement ratchets up the pressure on other mutual insurers facing challenges from carpetbaggers as it graphically illustrates just how much gold there is in \"them thar hills\".</p> <p> In all, 1.6m Scottish Widows policyholders are receiv ing payouts as a result of the takeover by Lloyds TSB. As has already been announced, all these people will receive a fixed payout of \u00a3500. However, 900,000 of the 1.6m hold with-profits policies and will also receive a variable sum based on the type of policy, its size and how long they have held it for.</p> <p> Last November, Widows said that payouts to these people would vary dramatically, from just a few hundred pounds to \u00a3100,000-plus, and would average \u00a35,600. </p> <p>However, it now says the payouts are likely to be around 8% higher than origi nally thought, which lifts that average figure to \u00a36,050. The reason for this is that the business is now judged to be worth more than it was when the original valuation was carried out, and as a result Lloyds TSB has upped the amount it is paying for it to \u00a37.3bn from \u00a36.7bn. </p> <p> Of this extra \u00a3600m, \u00a3400m will be paid out to policyholders immediately, while the remaining \u00a3200m will be added to \u00a31.3bn already set aside and will be paid out over time in the form of enhanced terminal bonuses to with-profits policyholders.</p> <p> The 8% extra figure is very much an average - some people will get more than this while others will get less. In the case of endowment policy-holders, the younger you started the policy, the larger the slice of extra cash you are likely to receive.</p> <p> However, policyholders will not know exactly how much they are getting until the cheques actually arrive, which is expected to be during the second half of August.</p> <p> For example, someone paying \u00a350 a month into a with-profits endowment policy since 1979 is looking at a windfall of \u00a314,700 - up sig nificantly from the original estimate of \u00a312,200 - if they were aged 40 when they took it out. If the person was 30 at the start of the contract they look set to pocket even more - \u00a315,300.</p> <p> Here are some more examples of revised potential payouts: <br> \u0095 Someone paying \u00a350 a month into a 25-year with-profits pension policy since 1979 is set for a windfall of \u00a317,500 (previous estimate: \u00a316,400) <br> \u0095 Someone paying \u00a3100 a month into a 25-year with-profits pension policy since 1989 is looking at a likely payout of \u00a36,550 (previous estimate: \u00a36,010) <br> \u0095 Someone paying \u00a3100 a month into a 25-year with-profits endowment since 1989 and who was aged 30 at the start of the policy, is in line for a windfall of \u00a36,340 (previous estimate: \u00a35,010) </p> <p>Scottish Widows will be writing to policyholders in the next few weeks to ask them how they want to receive their windfall. There are four options: <br> \u0095 Ask for a cheque to be sent to you.<br> \u0095 Have the cash paid into a \"VIP Premier Account\" with Scottish Widows Bank. This hasn't been launched yet so we don't know what the interest rate will be but it is likely to mimic the bank's existing instant access-style account which pays from 6.25%. To tempt people to go for this option, the company will be awarding an interest bonus of 0.5% for six months. <br> \u0095 Take your windfall in the form of loan notes, a sort of IOU that allows you to take your cash at a later stage. Loan notes are often used where people are worried that a windfall will exceed the annual capital gains tax allowance (currently \u00a37,200). <br> \u0095 For those not sure how much they are getting, but who are concerned about a possible tax liability, there is the option of taking loan notes if the windfall exceeds \u00a37,200, and a cheque if it doesn't. <br> \u0095 If you have any queries call the helpline: 0345 600 100. </p>",

The nightmare for Standard Life is that Mr Woollard - who stands to make \u00a3150,000 if the company converts - says he will quit campaigning only if the vote is below 50%. </p> <p>If the result is between 50% to 75%, he will put forward resolutions next year to stack the board with directors in favour of demutualisation. </p> <p>\"Let's say the vote is 65% for conversion.

He says: \"The company is being incredibly unprofessional. What are they afraid of?\"</p> <p> \u0095 Michael Head, an independent financial adviser from Colchester, is voting for mutuality despite a big payout potential. But he expects the carpetbaggers to win. He says: \"Competition is important. If Standard Life goes, the public will have less choice. It could have paid bonus payments, but didn't because it was too cautious.\" </p> <p> \u0095 Brenda Yoxall, an office manager from Beckenham, has binned her ballot paper. She admits she doesn't know which way the vote should go.

But if it creeps towards 75%, then it becomes very difficult for them to ignore it.\" Mr Love urges voters not to be swayed by the windfalls. \"It is clear that there are a very large number of policyholders who will receive a relatively small amount, and a small number who will receive huge amounts. Fred Woollard [the leader of the carpetbagging campaign] has produced figures on windfalls but no one knows where they come from. \"Many people voted for the demutualisation of Bradford &amp; Bingley expecting \u00a32,000 windfalls, and must be rather miffed that it is now closer to \u00a3750.\" Mr Woollard is convinced his campaign will achieve more than 50% support. \"I have no doubt we will get a strong majority\", he says, although he is less sure of hitting the 75% target. The nightmare for Standard Life is that Mr Woollard - who stands to make \u00a3150,000 if the company converts - says he will quit campaigning only if the vote is below 50%. If the result is between 50% to 75%, he will put forward resolutions next year to stack the board with directors in favour of demutualisation. \"Let's say the vote is 65% for conversion. Standard Life will say to me 'you didn't get your 75% so sod off'. But the problem the company faces is that I will not then go away. I will only go away if Standard Life gets more votes than we do.\" The result of the ballot will be announced in Edinburgh on June 27. The word on the street... \u0095 East Londoner David Turner sells terminals for Bloomberg. And he reckons it should be terminal for the Standard Life board, where he has held a policy for three years. He's voted for demutualisation and hopes to get nearly \u00a35,000. He says: \"The company is being incredibly unprofessional. What are they afraid of?\" \u0095 Michael Head, an independent financial adviser from Colchester, is voting for mutuality despite a big payout potential. But he expects the carpetbaggers to win. He says: \"Competition is important. If Standard Life goes, the public will have less choice. It could have paid bonus payments, but didn't because it was too cautious.\" \u0095 Brenda Yoxall, an office manager from Beckenham, has binned her ballot paper. She admits she doesn't know which way the vote should go. She says : \"I got fed up with the amount of confusing Standard Life infomation and by the time the voting forms came through I couldn't be bothered.\"",

And net sceptics will have even less confidence in the new technology following this week's Cahoot calamity. Cahoot (<a href=\"http://www.cahoot.com\">www.cahoot.com</a>) is Abbey National's much-promoted new internet bank, which fell foul of gremlins shortly after its launch, resulting in its website being out of action for a large chunk of Monday. </p> <p>Thousands of people who tried to sign up for Cahoot's mouth-watering introductory offer - interest-free overdrafts and credit cards for a year for the first 25,000 applicants - got the message: \"We apologise, but due to unprecedented demand the application process is not currently available.\" </p> <p>When Egg hatched in 1998 many customers trying to open accounts faced long delays because it badly underestimated the response to its launch. There were similar problems when Egg launched its credit card late last year. At around the same time the Halifax was forced to temporarily close its online share-dealing service after a technical glitch. </p> <p>Something like normal service has resumed at Cahoot, though the website was being taken down occasionally to stop it buckling under the strain. </p> <p>Cahoot is initially offering current accounts and credit cards, with online share-dealing, savings accounts and personal loans due to follow in the next few months. </p> <p>So how do its deals stack up? Well, if you're prepared to give the technology the benefit of the doubt, the Cahoot current account offers a very competitive, if not table-topping, deal. The main attraction is a savings account-style rate of interest on credit balances. You can choose whether or not to have a chequebook; if you opt for one you will receive a slightly lower rate of interest. </p> <p>Interest rates are tiered like a savings account, starting at 3% gross for balances of between \u00a31 and \u00a32,000 for those taking a cheque book, rising to 4.5% for those with more than \u00a32,000 in their account and no cheque book. These rates are leagues ahead of the paltry amounts paid by most leading high street banks. The big four - Barclays, Lloyds TSB, NatWest and HSBC - all pay standard current account holders a minuscule 0.1% gross. </p> <p>There are one or two players that beat Cahoot. Internet bank First-e, a division of the French Banque d'Escompte, is offering current account customers 4.88% gross on balances of \u00a31 upwards. Close behind is Smile, the Co-op's internet venture, paying 4.75% gross from \u00a31. Sun Bank, the UK banking arm of Sun Life Financial of Canada, has a cheque account paying from 4.8% gross, though the minimum balance is \u00a31,000. </p> <p>Another plus of the Cahoot current account is that it gives you an automatic \u00a3250 interest-free, fee-free overdraft. However, where it really hopes to trump rivals is in its ability to \"customise\" accounts to meet individual needs. For example, if you opt to borrow via an authorised overdraft or a Cahoot credit card, you'll be able to choose between paying interest or a fixed monthly fee. Its credit card and overdraft annual percentage rates are some of the best in the market, ranging from 7 to 11 APR. </p> <p>The precise rate offered will depend on creditworthiness, agreed overdraft/credit limit and \"profitability\" to the bank - ie, the more you borrow, the lower the rate you are likely to enjoy. </p> <p> For example, a typical medium-risk customer with a Cahoot current account who has requested an overdraft facility of \u00a33,000 and has a good credit rating has three options: paying interest of 9 APR; a monthly fee of \u00a317.55; or a combination of interest at 4.5 APR and a monthly fee of \u00a38.78. </p> <p>This tailored approach makes comparisons with other providers difficult. However, an overdraft rate of 9 APR is very low - less than half the 18.8 APR charged by high street giants such as Lloyds TSB. </p> <p>On the credit card front, some providers charge less than 9 APR but these are invariably special offers which last for just a few months. For example, Nationwide building society has a card with a rate on purchases of 3.5 APR for the first six months. Then the rate rises to 14.6 APR. Capital One Bank is offering a rate of 3.9 APR for the first six months (then 12.9 APR). The Marbles card and RBS Advanta are both offering 4.5 APR for the first six months and until March 1 2001 respectively. </p> <p>Cahoot hopes to steal a march on Intelligent Finance, the Halifax's stand-alone internet bank which goes live next month. But the main challenge both e-banks will face is persuading people to ditch their existing bank. Inertia rules, and mostpeople never get round to switching to another provider, even though they know there are better deals out there. </p> <p>But Intelligent Finance reckons attitudes are changing. It published a survey this week in which two out of five adults said they would be likely to move their account if a savings account-style rate of interest were on offer.</p>",

By hosting with leading service providers the founders of leading sites know they can cope with surges in traffic and deliver the best performance to their customers. </p> <p>Faster time to market , faster time to Initial Public Offering and lower risks.

There are plenty of affordable options, Business Incubator is one programme that gives advice and access to the four companies' technology which run most of the internet - Cisco Systems, Oracle, Sun Microsystems and Exodus Communications. Successful applicants can lease a range of hardware, software and network infrastructure at \u00a315,000 per month for three months. You could also go to a service provider to get up and running for a couple of thousand pounds for a basic interactive site. A new breed of service providers, such as Planet Online and Exodus Communications, offer a whole host of dot.com schemes. Or, for even less money, you can set up as part of an established online shopping mall. See it as having a shop front rather than having to build the whole outlet yourself. For the more ambitious dot.com, consultancy is a new type of holistic practice offering advice on planning, architecture and covering every area of the internet from setting up a portal, providing e-commerce back-up and servicing the business from the major systems integrators. This is especially attractive when building a heavy, service-driven site with additional features. PlanetOnline provides the technical support behind Freeserve, highlighting the fact that businesses recognise they get better service, support and time to market by outsourcing management of the technology that powers their e-commerce. If you are behind one of the new hugely successful dot.com start ups, it is imperative that you have a reliable, easy to upgrade infrastructure that will let you grow with demand. By hosting with leading service providers the founders of leading sites know they can cope with surges in traffic and deliver the best performance to their customers. Faster time to market , faster time to Initial Public Offering and lower risks. The IT industry has woken up to the need to offer advice, planning and easily implemented solutions to get dot.com ideas online. Look for consortiums of partners who can give you access to complementary services, depth of experience and faster time to market. \u0095 If you still need advice email me and I'll try to find a partner who can help you.

Here are some of your responses: </p> <p><strong> Martin Davies: </strong> \"I will be voting to take the money... I don't feel particularly proud as it smacks of selfish self-interest from one who wholeheartedly supports the idea of mutual status. However, Standard Life may well fail to deliver the promised goods in not only mine but many more cases of mortgage shortfall. </p> <p>\"I have part of my mortgage with Standard Life and have already obtained a reprojection of whether it will meet its expected amount - no surprises it won't! </p> <p>\"In my circle of friends I have two others with Standard Life mortgages and the results are similar. I am married with two children and the thought of shortfalls fills us with dread. I will be voting to take the money and invest it myself to hopefully make up the necessary money to pay the mortgage off.\" </p> <p><strong> Mr &amp; Mrs Brealey: </strong> \"We rang Standard Life recently to ask when we would receive an update on the progress of our endowment policy, to be told August, but they would send one within a few days if we so wished. On receiving the update, we were horrified to read that \"there is now a high risk that your plan may not pay out the target amount\". Other policyholders may wish to take advantage of the time available before the vote to obtain an update on the progress of their endowment plans.\" </p> <p><strong> Richard Cranfield: </strong> \"I have already voted with the carpetbaggers for the following reasons. I think the board doth protest too much and I felt I was being bullied to side with them. As I understand it, the return on my existing policy will not be affected by the change and I have no intention of taking out a new policy. The windfall will therefore be a bonus to me and I have nothing to lose. </p> <p>\"My experience of Standard Life has been inflexibility to the point of unhelpfulness. I am aware times have changed but they so thoroughly alienated me that even though I can see their side of the argument, I have no faith in the present organisation and will gladly take the money.\" </p> <p><strong> Richard Capewell: </strong> \"I am extremely angry at the behaviour of Standard Life. The glossy booklet sent to all members contained seven pages ar guing against demutualisation while allowing only one page to put the arguments in favour. </p> <p>\"The information about potential windfalls has been partial and misleading. I was informed that my policy might yield a windfall of \u00a36-\u00a310,000 based on a company valuation of \u00a312bn. I was given no information about the basis of such an estimate. </p> <p>\"I phoned to query the basis. I was told this time that I might receive \u00a36-10,000 based on a valuation of \u00a312bn, or \u00a310-15,000 based on a \u00a315bn valuation. I have subsequently discovered that many analysts value the company at \u00a316-18bn, which might yield me over \u00a320,000. Quite a difference from the \u00a36,000 first proferred by Standard Life. Unintended inefficiency or deliberately misleading?\" </p> <p><strong> Berwyn Jones: </strong> \"I have voted, with great sadness, for demutualisation. I do not want to see it happen, because I firmly believe in mutuality, but I fear that it seems inevitable, if not now then in the near future. Since my policy matures in two years' time, I would lose out if it were delayed. </p> <p>\"How much more sensible if the proceeds from demutualisation had to be shared out among not only current but also past members whose connection with the company had ceased within, say, 10 years. After all, these are the people whose investments had contributed to the fortunes of the company over recent decades.\" </p> <p><strong> Dave Clark: </strong> \"I am being asked whether I want to benefit from the resources of Standard Life until my policy matures or benefit from them in perpetuity. Not too difficult.\" </p> <p>Other readers are angry that they have been excluded from the ballot. Don Keller of Haringey, London, found that, though a member since 1988, he has lost a vote because of rule changes made in a 1991 Act of Parliament. </p> <p>David Rees of Swansea, was also caught out by the 1991 rule change - even though he has been with Standard Life since 1994. His policy matured in November 1999, and shortly before he took out another policy to ensure continuity of membership. But the 1991 rules require that the policy ran through the three-month period before November 15 to ensure a vote and a windfall - conditions which his policy does not meet. </p> <p>Gerald Marshall, a Glasgow City Council employee, has an in-house and AVC pension with Standard Life, but was not sent a ballot paper. Standard Life told him he is excluded from the ballot because the trustees of his scheme have the vote, and will reinvest any windfall into his policy. </p>",

I will be voting to take the money and invest it myself to hopefully make up the necessary money to pay the mortgage off.\" Mr &amp; Mrs Brealey: \"We rang Standard Life recently to ask when we would receive an update on the progress of our endowment policy, to be told August, but they would send one within a few days if we so wished. On receiving the update, we were horrified to read that \"there is now a high risk that your plan may not pay out the target amount\". Other policyholders may wish to take advantage of the time available before the vote to obtain an update on the progress of their endowment plans.\" Richard Cranfield: \"I have already voted with the carpetbaggers for the following reasons. I think the board doth protest too much and I felt I was being bullied to side with them. As I understand it, the return on my existing policy will not be affected by the change and I have no intention of taking out a new policy. The windfall will therefore be a bonus to me and I have nothing to lose. \"My experience of Standard Life has been inflexibility to the point of unhelpfulness. I am aware times have changed but they so thoroughly alienated me that even though I can see their side of the argument, I have no faith in the present organisation and will gladly take the money.\" Richard Capewell: \"I am extremely angry at the behaviour of Standard Life. The glossy booklet sent to all members contained seven pages ar guing against demutualisation while allowing only one page to put the arguments in favour. \"The information about potential windfalls has been partial and misleading. I was informed that my policy might yield a windfall of \u00a36-\u00a310,000 based on a company valuation of \u00a312bn. I was given no information about the basis of such an estimate. \"I phoned to query the basis. I was told this time that I might receive \u00a36-10,000 based on a valuation of \u00a312bn, or \u00a310-15,000 based on a \u00a315bn valuation. I have subsequently discovered that many analysts value the company at \u00a316-18bn, which might yield me over \u00a320,000. Quite a difference from the \u00a36,000 first proferred by Standard Life. Unintended inefficiency or deliberately misleading?\" Berwyn Jones: \"I have voted, with great sadness, for demutualisation. I do not want to see it happen, because I firmly believe in mutuality, but I fear that it seems inevitable, if not now then in the near future. Since my policy matures in two years' time, I would lose out if it were delayed. \"How much more sensible if the proceeds from demutualisation had to be shared out among not only current but also past members whose connection with the company had ceased within, say, 10 years. After all, these are the people whose investments had contributed to the fortunes of the company over recent decades.\" Dave Clark: \"I am being asked whether I want to benefit from the resources of Standard Life until my policy matures or benefit from them in perpetuity. Not too difficult.\" Other readers are angry that they have been excluded from the ballot. Don Keller of Haringey, London, found that, though a member since 1988, he has lost a vote because of rule changes made in a 1991 Act of Parliament. David Rees of Swansea, was also caught out by the 1991 rule change - even though he has been with Standard Life since 1994. His policy matured in November 1999, and shortly before he took out another policy to ensure continuity of membership. But the 1991 rules require that the policy ran through the three-month period before November 15 to ensure a vote and a windfall - conditions which his policy does not meet. Gerald Marshall, a Glasgow City Council employee, has an in-house and AVC pension with Standard Life, but was not sent a ballot paper. Standard Life told him he is excluded from the ballot because the trustees of his scheme have the vote, and will reinvest any windfall into his policy.",

An \"ownership and control\" clause in the treaty excludes airlines from other countries. </p> <p>Under the structure being discussed, KLM would remain intact and become a subsidiary of British Airways, which in order to comply with international aviation regulations would own only 49% of the voting shares in the Dutch company. </p> <p>\"British Airways would have a 100% economic interest in a subsidiary that is KLM, which will have some ingenious bits and pieces in the way it is structured to satisfy Dutch corporate governance rules and the aero-political implications of foreign ownership,\" said one source close to the deal. </p> <p>The remaining 51% of KLM would be owned by Dutch investors, with financial institutions brought in as \"friendly\" shareholders. These investors would hold an \"A\" share equivalent, with no real economic value, while British Airways would also own a \"B\" share which would have no nominal value or voting rights but would capture perhaps 99% of the economic interest. </p> <p>United Airlines said earlier this week that the United States might waive any objection to KLM ceasing to be Dutch but only if Britain agreed to open up the British transatlantic aviation market. </p> <p>\u0095 The airline formerly known as ValuJet is in the early stages of merger talks with US carrier Trans World Airlines.

Under the structure being discussed, KLM would remain intact and become a subsidiary of British Airways, which in order to comply with international aviation regulations would own only 49% of the voting shares in the Dutch company. \"British Airways would have a 100% economic interest in a subsidiary that is KLM, which will have some ingenious bits and pieces in the way it is structured to satisfy Dutch corporate governance rules and the aero-political implications of foreign ownership,\" said one source close to the deal. The remaining 51% of KLM would be owned by Dutch investors, with financial institutions brought in as \"friendly\" shareholders. These investors would hold an \"A\" share equivalent, with no real economic value, while British Airways would also own a \"B\" share which would have no nominal value or voting rights but would capture perhaps 99% of the economic interest. United Airlines said earlier this week that the United States might waive any objection to KLM ceasing to be Dutch but only if Britain agreed to open up the British transatlantic aviation market. \u0095 The airline formerly known as ValuJet is in the early stages of merger talks with US carrier Trans World Airlines. Last month it was announced that United Airlines would buy US Airways Group for $4.3bn (\u00a32.6bn).",

      "body": "<p>The investment trusts failed to capture the imagination of personal equity plan investors, never accounting for more than 10% of new Pep business. </p> <p>But there are signs that investment trusts are capturing a much larger slice of Isa sales. </p> <p>Under the Isa rules, many more investment trusts are eligible to be included within an Isa wrapper than were allowed within a Pep. </p> <p>Under the Pep rules only 25% of a Pep portfolio could be invested in markets outside Europe and the UK. Isas, on the other hand, can be invested in any internationally recognised stock exchange. And it is here that the majority of trusts invest. </p> <p>There are two ways to shelter investment trusts within an Isa. If you only want to invest in the trusts offered by one management group, look at the Isa wrappers offered by the various investment trust houses. Virtually all investment trust groups offer their own Isas. </p> <p>With the majority of unit trust and Oeic savings schemes there is no extra charge for the Isa wrapper. Investment trusts, however, often make a small extra charge for the Isa package. Foreign &amp; Colonial, for example, has a \u00a350 initial and \u00a360 annual charge, plus 0.2% dealing costs. </p> <p>Investment trust management charges are lower than those levied on unit trusts and Oeics, so most investment trust Isas remain competitively priced despite fees. </p> <p>Charges vary, but houses levy an initial charge, usually about 1% of the total investment as well as an annual administration charge. These charges vary and will either be a fixed fee, say \u00a330 or more, or percentage based, perhaps 0.5% a year.

      "bodyText": "The investment trusts failed to capture the imagination of personal equity plan investors, never accounting for more than 10% of new Pep business. But there are signs that investment trusts are capturing a much larger slice of Isa sales. Under the Isa rules, many more investment trusts are eligible to be included within an Isa wrapper than were allowed within a Pep. Under the Pep rules only 25% of a Pep portfolio could be invested in markets outside Europe and the UK. Isas, on the other hand, can be invested in any internationally recognised stock exchange. And it is here that the majority of trusts invest. There are two ways to shelter investment trusts within an Isa. If you only want to invest in the trusts offered by one management group, look at the Isa wrappers offered by the various investment trust houses. Virtually all investment trust groups offer their own Isas. With the majority of unit trust and Oeic savings schemes there is no extra charge for the Isa wrapper. Investment trusts, however, often make a small extra charge for the Isa package. Foreign &amp; Colonial, for example, has a \u00a350 initial and \u00a360 annual charge, plus 0.2% dealing costs. Investment trust management charges are lower than those levied on unit trusts and Oeics, so most investment trust Isas remain competitively priced despite fees. Charges vary, but houses levy an initial charge, usually about 1% of the total investment as well as an annual administration charge. These charges vary and will either be a fixed fee, say \u00a330 or more, or percentage based, perhaps 0.5% a year. If you intend to bundle together several Isas with the same manager, those charging a fixed fee will prove more cost effective over the long term. Nevertheless, investment trust aficionados need to be sure that any extra charge for an Isa wrapper does not wipe out all the tax benefits. For example, last year the financial adviser BEST Investment analysed the effect of charges on yields from investment trust Isas compared to their unit trust equivalents based on the average charges of each product. According to the study, the costs of investment trust Isas knocks, on average, 2.4% off your income. By contrast, the reduction in yield for unit trust or Oeic Isas was just 2.07%. But individual trusts may fare better. One of the most competi tively priced Isas is available through Alliance Trust, an independently managed international generalist trust based in Dundee. Its Isa charges no annual administration fee, although it does levy minimal charges for investments and the reinvestment of dividends. Unlike most other Isas, the Alliance Isa also allows investors to buy other investment trusts as well as bonds, gilts and many UK equities. Another option is to choose a self-select Isa, which permits investment into equities as well as UK-listed investment trusts. Remember that all charges on investment trust Isas are in addition to underlying fund management charges of each trust. \u0095 Unit trusts can invest in a portfolio of investment trusts to give a unique hybrid package. Funds of investment trusts come into their own because managers can use trading skills to make the most of rising and falling discounts and underlying asset values. Managers with unit trusts that invest in investment trust shares include Quilter &amp; Co, Aberdeen Asset Management, Equitable Life, Exeter Fund Managers and Jupiter. They can also use their institutional clout to influence investment trust managers so their unitholders benefit.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>There was no mistaking Frank Rijkaard's message yesterday as he accused his players of lacking the spirit and focus to win Euro 2000. The flowers here at the Dutch hotel may spell out \"Orange Success\", but the coach was not fooled into thinking that all in his garden is rosy after his side's lucky victory over the Czech Republic. For almost the first time since his appointment two years ago his friendly public face dissolved into criticism. </p> <p>\"The determination of other teams has struck me,\" he said. \"They have been playing for each other, not just for themselves. Holland didn't show that team spirit. It's a major issue I have to make clear. </p> <p>\"For two years we have been playing friendlies and had the excuse that it was not for real. But when it's for real I expect them to know that because this team has experience. Without everyone giving everything for the team we will have a hard time. We can be confident about our qualities but the qualities need something to come out.\" </p> <p>Rijkaard hinted he was as concerned by the attitude away from pitch as on it. He has found several of his squad paying more attention to the ace of hearts than the ace in a potential opponent's midfield when the tournament has been showing. \"They have been playing cards and just looking a bit at the game,\" he said, \"and then at the end they say it was a bad match. That's not my mentality. You always need to have the highest respect for your opponents. If you see them fighting you know you have to give something extra. That's my concern. </p> <p>\"One of the first players who didn't watch games in the team-building process [in the 80s] was Ruud Gullit. When we were watching opponents he said he was tired of watching football and put on his headphones. But when he played he always gave 100%. I don't tell them to watch every game but if they don't they must make sure they are ready.\" </p> <p>Some locals, shocked by Rijkaard's strong words, suggested the aim was to deflect criticism of his tactics and coaching talent. Almost certainly he hopes to get a response against Denmark tonight and prove to the people he shares their concerns. With the Dutch, though, there is no telling what might happen. </p> <p>The players sounded bemused rather than angry. In response Dennis Bergkamp blamed poor concentration rather than poor spirit for the lacklustre opening display. Michael Reiziger also begged to differ. \"You always have to fight,\" he said, \"but I didn't think that was the problem.\" </p> <p>Rijkaard's outburst smacked more of psychology than of evidence that Holland are preparing to implode spectacularly once again, but he is all too aware that the Danes will be more determined than ever to gain a spectacular result following their 3-0 defeat to France. The smallest signs have been seized on by a worried public, with Edgar Davids castigated for conducting a post-match interview in a baseball cap. That, they said, stank of arrogance and superstardom when the performance warranted humility. </p> <p>Rijkaard insisted his players were not stifled by the expectations, but Peter Schmeichel was not slow to point out after training last night that the pressure on the Dutch was \"enormous\".

      "bodyText": "There was no mistaking Frank Rijkaard's message yesterday as he accused his players of lacking the spirit and focus to win Euro 2000. The flowers here at the Dutch hotel may spell out \"Orange Success\", but the coach was not fooled into thinking that all in his garden is rosy after his side's lucky victory over the Czech Republic. For almost the first time since his appointment two years ago his friendly public face dissolved into criticism. \"The determination of other teams has struck me,\" he said. \"They have been playing for each other, not just for themselves. Holland didn't show that team spirit. It's a major issue I have to make clear. \"For two years we have been playing friendlies and had the excuse that it was not for real. But when it's for real I expect them to know that because this team has experience. Without everyone giving everything for the team we will have a hard time. We can be confident about our qualities but the qualities need something to come out.\" Rijkaard hinted he was as concerned by the attitude away from pitch as on it. He has found several of his squad paying more attention to the ace of hearts than the ace in a potential opponent's midfield when the tournament has been showing. \"They have been playing cards and just looking a bit at the game,\" he said, \"and then at the end they say it was a bad match. That's not my mentality. You always need to have the highest respect for your opponents. If you see them fighting you know you have to give something extra. That's my concern. \"One of the first players who didn't watch games in the team-building process [in the 80s] was Ruud Gullit. When we were watching opponents he said he was tired of watching football and put on his headphones. But when he played he always gave 100%. I don't tell them to watch every game but if they don't they must make sure they are ready.\" Some locals, shocked by Rijkaard's strong words, suggested the aim was to deflect criticism of his tactics and coaching talent. Almost certainly he hopes to get a response against Denmark tonight and prove to the people he shares their concerns. With the Dutch, though, there is no telling what might happen. The players sounded bemused rather than angry. In response Dennis Bergkamp blamed poor concentration rather than poor spirit for the lacklustre opening display. Michael Reiziger also begged to differ. \"You always have to fight,\" he said, \"but I didn't think that was the problem.\" Rijkaard's outburst smacked more of psychology than of evidence that Holland are preparing to implode spectacularly once again, but he is all too aware that the Danes will be more determined than ever to gain a spectacular result following their 3-0 defeat to France. The smallest signs have been seized on by a worried public, with Edgar Davids castigated for conducting a post-match interview in a baseball cap. That, they said, stank of arrogance and superstardom when the performance warranted humility. Rijkaard insisted his players were not stifled by the expectations, but Peter Schmeichel was not slow to point out after training last night that the pressure on the Dutch was \"enormous\". Asked what Denmark could do, the goalkeeper was less than impressed. \"To ask what we can do is a bit of an insult,\" he said. \"We reached the quarter-finals of the World Cup in 1998 and, of course, eight years ago we won the European Championship.\" This time, though, they almost certainly need to win to survive and Holland hope that will leave them gaps to exploit at the back. The Dutch are expected to drop the unpopular Clarence Seedorf and install Ronald de Boer at right midfield and might opt for Arsenal's Marc Overmars ahead of Boudewijn Zenden. Bert Konterman comes in for the injured Jaap Stam. Denmark's coach, Bo Johansson, who is without Chelsea's Jes Hogh and has the Udinese winger Martin Jorgensen struggling with a groin strain, feels his team are meeting Holland at the wrong time. \"Maybe it would have been better for us if they had played wonderfully and won 5-0,\" he said. \"Then they could have underestimated us.\" After all the rows it must feel like normality has returned for the Dutch.

      "bodyText": "Chris Sutton's brief and unfulfilling spell at Chelsea is likely to end shortly with a \u00a36m switch to Middlesbrough. Only 12 months after moving to Stamford Bridge from Blackburn in a \u00a310m deal, the former England striker is ready to turn his back on the capital in the belief that he will be able to relaunch a fractured career on Teesside. The clubs are believed to have agreed a fee yesterday and Sutton is expected to travel to the north-east for talks once the Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson has returned from a family holiday. Robson is anxious to recruit at least three new players before the start of next season and would finance any deal for Sutton by selling the Colombian international Hamilton Ricard. Meanwhile, the first member of England's Euro 2000 squad to book a removal van on his return home may well be Everton's Nick Barmby. Barmby informed the Merseyside club two weeks ago that he would not sign a new long-term contract unless his return to the England squad was rewarded in the traditional manner: with a huge pay rise. Leeds have already con tacted Everton to express an interest in the much-travelled utility man and if they were to lodge a bid in the region of \u00a37m, Barmby would be theirs. Although Everton's manager Walter Smith would like Barmby to remain at Goodison Park, money is still an elusive commodity at his club and he would not hesitate to sell a player who will be available on a free transfer in 12 months. Fulham's manager Jean Tigana has completed his first signing, taking his fellow-Frenchman Louis Saha from Metz for \u00a32.1m. Tigana said of the 21-year-old striker: \"I believe he will be a very good player in the First Division and has the right qualities to be a success in the Premiership.\" Ally McCoist has told Kilmarnock he will return for pre-season training before deciding where to finish his career. The 37-year-old former Scotland striker, who is likely to delay his retirement until next summer, is wanted by Carlisle, whose new manager Ian Atkins is keen to open talks with McCoist once the player returns from working with ITV at Euro 2000. McCoist is out of contract at Kilmarnock but the Scottish club may offer him a pay-as-you-play deal.",

The stattos tell me that compares with 15 at Euro 96 and 11 at Euro 92. At this rate I'd better hope they can get me into the commentary box for 2044. </p> <p>It struck me watching the Champions League how open matches have become, with fewer teams squeezing games and pushing up from the back. Perhaps there are more good attacking players but I wonder whether there just aren't as many good defenders, not only at the back but in midfield. </p> <p>England typify the problems at the back. I think there's a real dearth of old-style defenders. When you talk to people about centre-halves they say: \"Can he bring the ball out?\" But for me that's a bonus. First and foremost they have to be able to defend the goal. </p> <p>Look at Jaap Stam. He can play the ball but he knows his basic responsibilities. He'll get his body in. Martin Keown, who's unlucky not to be an automatic choice for England, is similar. He'll hang on to you all day, challenge and dispute everything. Centre-forwards don't like that. </p> <p>On Wednesday the Italian centre-backs, Fabio Cannavaro and Alessandro Nesta, certainly took no prisoners. They were outstanding, although I must admit there wasn't a great deal of poise. For a top-class side Italy hoofed a lot of balls. </p> <p>In terms of midfielders it strikes me the quantity of good defensive men has dropped. I'm talking about people like Bryan Robson or Graeme Souness, to use British examples. Marco Tardelli could shut up shop when Italy were attacking. Even in the great France team of 1982-86, Luis Fernandez could play the midfield dog. And whatever people say about the Beautiful Game, let's not forget that Brazil play with two who can dig. </p> <p>Of course I'm not complaining. Even in the Norway-Spain match there was tension, wondering whether Spain could nick an equaliser. And it was similar in Italy's game on Wednesday, which wasn't one of the best. In fact, with the refereeing generally being good, it's hard to find much to moan about. </p> <p>The biggest worry for me is the potential for violence in Charleroi tomorrow. It's not exactly like playing a World Cup game in Stratford-upon-Avon but the sidestreets around the ground mean, if it goes off, it could be hard to control. There is no big car-park space to herd people into the right areas. </p> <p>France were my tip to win the title and I see no reason to change. The only team who have performed as well were Slovenia, for an hour against Yugoslavia. They looked the best-coached and best-prepared team in the tournament, and also brought that element of surprise. I think they would have beaten anyone else comfortably from 3-0 up. But they seemed to get nervous because it was so-called big brother. </p> <p>They have produced a couple of the stars of the tournament so far in Zlatko Zahovic and the left-wing-back Amir Karic. Alongside them as the outstanding performers I put Zinedine Zidane, Rui Costa, Luis Figo, Pavel Nedved, Paul Scholes, Cannavaro and Nesta. </p> <p>Holland have been a major disappointment. There was a lot of finger-wagging and they seemed very intense, as if they were feeling the expectation. I think they need Marc Overmars to go down the outside of teams and Patrick Kluivert to put himself about more. </p> <p>Otherwise the biggest flops have been the England defenders and, in particular, Yugoslavia's Sinisa Mihajlovic. Against Slovenia his free-kicks were useless, he couldn't win anything in the air and his error led to the third goal. He was having such a nightmare he might have strengthened the team by being sent off.</p>",

I think there's a real dearth of old-style defenders. When you talk to people about centre-halves they say: \"Can he bring the ball out?\" But for me that's a bonus. First and foremost they have to be able to defend the goal. Look at Jaap Stam. He can play the ball but he knows his basic responsibilities. He'll get his body in. Martin Keown, who's unlucky not to be an automatic choice for England, is similar. He'll hang on to you all day, challenge and dispute everything. Centre-forwards don't like that. On Wednesday the Italian centre-backs, Fabio Cannavaro and Alessandro Nesta, certainly took no prisoners. They were outstanding, although I must admit there wasn't a great deal of poise. For a top-class side Italy hoofed a lot of balls. In terms of midfielders it strikes me the quantity of good defensive men has dropped. I'm talking about people like Bryan Robson or Graeme Souness, to use British examples. Marco Tardelli could shut up shop when Italy were attacking. Even in the great France team of 1982-86, Luis Fernandez could play the midfield dog. And whatever people say about the Beautiful Game, let's not forget that Brazil play with two who can dig. Of course I'm not complaining. Even in the Norway-Spain match there was tension, wondering whether Spain could nick an equaliser. And it was similar in Italy's game on Wednesday, which wasn't one of the best. In fact, with the refereeing generally being good, it's hard to find much to moan about. The biggest worry for me is the potential for violence in Charleroi tomorrow. It's not exactly like playing a World Cup game in Stratford-upon-Avon but the sidestreets around the ground mean, if it goes off, it could be hard to control. There is no big car-park space to herd people into the right areas. France were my tip to win the title and I see no reason to change. The only team who have performed as well were Slovenia, for an hour against Yugoslavia. They looked the best-coached and best-prepared team in the tournament, and also brought that element of surprise. I think they would have beaten anyone else comfortably from 3-0 up. But they seemed to get nervous because it was so-called big brother. They have produced a couple of the stars of the tournament so far in Zlatko Zahovic and the left-wing-back Amir Karic. Alongside them as the outstanding performers I put Zinedine Zidane, Rui Costa, Luis Figo, Pavel Nedved, Paul Scholes, Cannavaro and Nesta. Holland have been a major disappointment. There was a lot of finger-wagging and they seemed very intense, as if they were feeling the expectation. I think they need Marc Overmars to go down the outside of teams and Patrick Kluivert to put himself about more. Otherwise the biggest flops have been the England defenders and, in particular, Yugoslavia's Sinisa Mihajlovic. Against Slovenia his free-kicks were useless, he couldn't win anything in the air and his error led to the third goal. He was having such a nightmare he might have strengthened the team by being sent off.",

But Schmeichel is out to claim comfortably. A worrying defensive lapse for the Danes, that.</p> <p><strong>11</strong> Reiziger hauls down Gronkjaer. He's in the book.</p> <p><strong>14</strong> Bergkamp and Boudewijn Zenden combine down the right. The Arsenal striker finds space in the Danish box and fends off a challenge from Jan Heintze... he's free! All he needs to do is square a simple pass to the loitering Kluivert and it's 1-0! Oh look, he's tripped over his own feet.</p> <p><strong>19</strong> After a small injury break we're back (as is Cocu, the man who was prone). The Dutch pass it around for ages and ages. It's very pretty, but after about 30 passes it ends in a throw-in for Denmark. Shades of Columbia in the 1994 World Cup.</p> <p><strong>23</strong> Gronkjaer tracks back to upend Bergkamp near the right-hand corner flag. A dangerous position for a free-kick. But Gio van Bronckhorst's delivery is worse than useless and Schmeichel claims easily. He throws it long...</p> <p><strong>24</strong> ... and Denmark are away. Thomas Gravesen is free on the right. He whips it towards the head of Allan Nielsen, but van der Sar beats the Tottenham man to punch the ball away. Gravesen follows up, but his goal-bound shot hits the prone Nielsen on the head. Unlucky, and strangely comical.</p> <p><strong>28</strong> Gronkjaer beats Reiziger yet again down the left. His cross is swept away by Frank de Boer.</p> <p><strong>30</strong> Zenden zips clear down the right. He lashes a cross in towards Kluivert, standing on the penalty spot, but it's behind the striker. Never mind, in from the left comes a rampaging Overmars who bundles it back to Kluivert. He miscontrols, but Overmars gets another chance - he lifts it over the advancing Danish keeper for the opening goa... no, it's agonisingly wide.</p> <p><strong>32</strong> Tomasson is in the Dutch box, under an inviting cross. He tries an overhead kick, but the end result is like the St James' Park days all over again. In other words, oh dear.</p> <p><strong>36</strong> Denmark break again, when a move between Bergkamp and Kluivert breaks down. Gravesen could pass to Nielsen, who is free in the middle, but hacking the ball uselessly against Frank de Boer's legs appears to have been more inviting.</p> <p><strong>37</strong> Davids beats Rene Henriksen to a through ball. He's running at full pelt with the ball at his feet in the Danish area... but no goal, because Schmeichel comes out and parries the Juve midfielder's shot away. Classic stuff.</p> <p><strong>41</strong> Zenden swings one in for Bergkamp, who nearly gets his head to the inviting cross. Holland beginning to assert themselves in this match now.</p> <p><strong>44</strong> Gravesen nearly breaks the deadlock. Nielsen and Gronkjaer carve the Dutch defence apart simply by stroking a few passes about. The Hamburg midfielder receives the ball in space on the edge of the area and smoothly curls a ball up and around the stranded van der Sar - but the ball pings the crossbar when it really deserved to go in. For goal of the tournament, that could have been a contender.</p> <p><strong>45</strong> Injury time in the first half. Davids gets a bit chippy about nothing at all, Overmars nearly latches onto a through ball but Schmeichel collects, the referee blows his whistle.</p> <p><strong>HALF TIME: Holland 0 - 0 Denmark</strong></p> <p><strong>46</strong> Denmark kick off. Gronkjaer has been on the pitch for a fair while running off a knock. Will he last the half?</p> <p><strong>47</strong> Well he looks pretty fit - he tears down the left and smashes a shot into the side netting.</p> <p><strong>49</strong> Nielsen is booked for a late lunge on Davids.</p> <p><strong>50</strong> The free kick, which is in a good position for the Dutch, is wasted as the men in those gauche blue shirts faff about. Sometimes you can have just too much intricate passing.</p> <p><strong>54</strong> Konterman is forced to make a late clearance as Tomasson nips past Frank de Boer, who looked to be comfortably in possession. Complacency is creeping into the Dutch defence.</p> <p><strong>55</strong> Konterman is booked for scything down Gravesen.</p> <p><strong>56 GOAL Holland 1 - 0 Denmark</strong> The Feyenoord stadium erupts. Bergkamp slides into the Danish box after a through ball. Schmeichel spreads himself to parry but the ball falls outside the box to Kluivert, who cooly sidefoots the ball around the prone keeper and into the net for his 24th international goal.</p> <p><strong>60</strong> van Bronckhorst wins a corner. Bergkamp takes it from the left: Schmeichel parries and races to collect his own ball. He claims it, but then must drop it as he sails outside the box. Luckily for him, he manages to welt it upfield.</p> <p><strong>61</strong> Holland make a change: Overmars off, Ronald de Boer on, Zenden moves out to the left wing. So do Denmark: Stig Tofting comes on for Nielsen.</p> <p><strong>63</strong> Sand makes a useful run into Dutch territory, but he chooses to run into de Boer - ouch - instead of passing to Gronkjaer. Not a classic piece of action, but it shows the match isn't over yet, no matter what the ecstatic crowd may think at present.</p> <p><strong>64</strong> Frank de Boer goes for goal with an indirect free kick. He wins a corner from a deflection, so it wasn't too daft a move. The same can't be said for the resulting set piece from Bergkamp.</p> <p><strong>66 GOAL Holland 2 - 0 Denmark </strong> Reiziger wins a throw deep in Danish territory down the right. The ball is worked out to the other wing, where Zenden awaits in space. He turns, and slides in a superb ball across the front of the Danish goal, between a hapless Schmeichel and his static defenders. Ronald de Boer, steaming in, simply has to touch the ball into an empty net. Simple, but still lovely to watch.</p> <p><strong>71</strong> Lovely space-finding skills from Kluivert sets off a speedy Dutch move. The ball is sent out to Zenden, who curls in another delicious cross back to his Barca team-mate. Schmeichel is there in the nick of time - could have been three.</p> <p><strong>72</strong> Davids steams through but takes a fresh air shot. Could have been three.</p> <p><strong>72</strong> Zenden finds Kluivert free in the centre with only Schmeichel to beat, but the Barca striker gets a bit too excited and is just offside. Could have been three. Denmark hanging on, shall we say.</p> <p><strong>75</strong> Kluivert beats Heintze to the ball and races clear - he stumbles.</p> <p><strong>75</strong> He's in again! Again his control is poor, but the ball breaks to Davids. Sadly for the majority of onlookers, he blasts high and wide. Denmark are suddenly totally useless.</p> <p><strong>76</strong> Aron Winter replaces Bergkamp.</p> <p><strong>77 GOAL Holland 3 - 0 Denmark</strong> Reiziger gets the ball and bombs down the right. He keeps going and keeps going, even though a pass to Zenden, who is free in the centre, seems the sensible option. But his judgement is vindicated when he tears past the Danish defence and bears down on goal. It looks as though he'll blast the ball into the net himself, but at the very last minute he passes it unselfishly across to Zenden who sidefoots home. These goals are getting better and better.</p> <p><strong>80 Penalty miss</strong> Sand chases after an up-and-under. He's brought down by van der Sar - penalty! Sadly for the abject Danes, Schjonberg passes the ball past the Juve keeper's left-hand post. Within a minute he's replaced by AC Milan's Thomas Helveg.</p> <p><strong>85</strong> That seems to have taken the life out of the game. We're just running down the clock now...</p> <p><strong>89</strong> Liverpool's Sander Westerveld comes on for van der Sar, who is being taken off as a precaution after taking a knock.</p> <p><strong>90</strong> It's injury time. Four minutes of it. There's not much going on. The ref finally has enough. It's over. Holland and France are in the quarter-finals and Denmark and the Czechs are out.</p> <p>FULL TIME: Holland 3 - 0 Denmark</p>",

Will he last the half? 47 Well he looks pretty fit - he tears down the left and smashes a shot into the side netting. 49 Nielsen is booked for a late lunge on Davids. 50 The free kick, which is in a good position for the Dutch, is wasted as the men in those gauche blue shirts faff about. Sometimes you can have just too much intricate passing. 54 Konterman is forced to make a late clearance as Tomasson nips past Frank de Boer, who looked to be comfortably in possession. Complacency is creeping into the Dutch defence. 55 Konterman is booked for scything down Gravesen. 56 GOAL Holland 1 - 0 Denmark The Feyenoord stadium erupts. Bergkamp slides into the Danish box after a through ball. Schmeichel spreads himself to parry but the ball falls outside the box to Kluivert, who cooly sidefoots the ball around the prone keeper and into the net for his 24th international goal. 60 van Bronckhorst wins a corner. Bergkamp takes it from the left: Schmeichel parries and races to collect his own ball. He claims it, but then must drop it as he sails outside the box. Luckily for him, he manages to welt it upfield. 61 Holland make a change: Overmars off, Ronald de Boer on, Zenden moves out to the left wing. So do Denmark: Stig Tofting comes on for Nielsen. 63 Sand makes a useful run into Dutch territory, but he chooses to run into de Boer - ouch - instead of passing to Gronkjaer. Not a classic piece of action, but it shows the match isn't over yet, no matter what the ecstatic crowd may think at present. 64 Frank de Boer goes for goal with an indirect free kick. He wins a corner from a deflection, so it wasn't too daft a move. The same can't be said for the resulting set piece from Bergkamp. 66 GOAL Holland 2 - 0 Denmark Reiziger wins a throw deep in Danish territory down the right. The ball is worked out to the other wing, where Zenden awaits in space. He turns, and slides in a superb ball across the front of the Danish goal, between a hapless Schmeichel and his static defenders. Ronald de Boer, steaming in, simply has to touch the ball into an empty net. Simple, but still lovely to watch. 71 Lovely space-finding skills from Kluivert sets off a speedy Dutch move. The ball is sent out to Zenden, who curls in another delicious cross back to his Barca team-mate. Schmeichel is there in the nick of time - could have been three. 72 Davids steams through but takes a fresh air shot. Could have been three. 72 Zenden finds Kluivert free in the centre with only Schmeichel to beat, but the Barca striker gets a bit too excited and is just offside. Could have been three. Denmark hanging on, shall we say. 75 Kluivert beats Heintze to the ball and races clear - he stumbles. 75 He's in again! Again his control is poor, but the ball breaks to Davids. Sadly for the majority of onlookers, he blasts high and wide. Denmark are suddenly totally useless. 76 Aron Winter replaces Bergkamp. 77 GOAL Holland 3 - 0 Denmark Reiziger gets the ball and bombs down the right. He keeps going and keeps going, even though a pass to Zenden, who is free in the centre, seems the sensible option. But his judgement is vindicated when he tears past the Danish defence and bears down on goal. It looks as though he'll blast the ball into the net himself, but at the very last minute he passes it unselfishly across to Zenden who sidefoots home. These goals are getting better and better. 80 Penalty miss Sand chases after an up-and-under. He's brought down by van der Sar - penalty! Sadly for the abject Danes, Schjonberg passes the ball past the Juve keeper's left-hand post. Within a minute he's replaced by AC Milan's Thomas Helveg. 85 That seems to have taken the life out of the game. We're just running down the clock now... 89 Liverpool's Sander Westerveld comes on for van der Sar, who is being taken off as a precaution after taking a knock. 90 It's injury time. Four minutes of it. There's not much going on. The ref finally has enough. It's over. Holland and France are in the quarter-finals and Denmark and the Czechs are out. FULL TIME: Holland 3 - 0 Denmark",

As the pert paramedic Daneka, Robin Tunney is one of the crew members who regularly enjoy zero-gravity sex, with a sexy-Bambi face making her look like the young Demi Moore.",

No, we're sure he's really sweating about more important matters like getting his midfield to press hard and getting his central defenders to stay awake, but it's just that it doesn't sound like it. </p> <p>Aside from commenting on the likely colour of England's shirts, Koogan made very few remarks today with lines such as: \"The spirit is fantastic and as long as we keep believing in ourselves I think we can still make progress.

Cagey also applies to Koogan's expected team selection. While an official announcement isn't expected to be made on the XI until tomorrow, the usual fast-leaking sources are certain that the introduction of Martin Keown and Dennis Wise for the injured Tony Adams and Steve McManaman will be the only changes and that Koogan will persist with 4-4-2.

Liverpool midfielder Dieter Hamann, for instance, didn't bother slagging off his own players today (for a change), but instead concentrated his fire on England. \"They have talented individuals but they're not a good team,\" was his damning assessment. And even old sourpuss Matthaus was in a confident mood. \"I can reassure everyone I am top fit again and I feel great,\" he said after borrowing Ribbeck's walking stick: \"I am sure I'll play much better against England.\" Isn't that funny?</p> <p>German team: Oliver Kahn; Markus Babbel, Lothar Matthaus, Jens Nowotny, Sebastian Deisler, Christian Ziege, Dietmar Hamann, Jens Jeremies, Mehmet Scholl, Carsten Jancker, Ulf Kirsten.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"The press is always speaking negatively about me.

Like other towns and cities in Britain, Newport is by no means free of the stain of racial harassment and abuse. But the town prides itself on its multi-cultural identity and has worked hard in recent years to monitor and tackle the problem. The death this week of Jan Martin Pasalbessi, 48, in what police are treating as a racist murder has left agencies dealing with race issues in a state of shocked disbelief. Race relations in Pill, the docklands area where the murdered man lived, are generally good. The area, near the town's world famous transporter bridge, has a down at heel look to it.

I am shocked by what was a senseless act of brutality.\" Mr Pasalbessi died after being attacked by a group of white youths outside the Royal Gwent hospital on Monday night. He had taken his 14-year-old stepdaughter, Christina, who is white, to the hospital for treatment after she received a cut face in what is thought to have been a racist incident outside their home. A relative of the person involved in the earlier incident was among those who began arguing with Mr Pasalbessi - who suffered horrific head injuries after being punched and kicked by a four-strong gang as he lay on the ground. He died in hospital in Cardiff the following afternoon. Christina, who watched helplessly, was yesterday being cared for by police family protection unit officers. Relatives were travelling from Holland to be with her. Mr Pasalbessi and Christina had moved into housing association accommodation in Pill only two weeks earlier after suffering what Mr Pasalbessi claimed was racial harassment from neighbours in another part of the town. Pill is home to a large part of the diverse ethnic community that took root when Newport docks became established in the 19th century. Ethnic minorities, including strong Somali, Yemeni and Pakistani communities, make up almost 4% of Newport's 138,000 population.

      "byline": "By Doris Lessing",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>'How old are you?' </p> <p>'Eighteen.' </p> <p> This reply did not come at once because Ben was afraid of what he knew was going to happen now, which was that the young man behind the glass protecting him from the public set down his biro on the form he was filling in, and then, with a look on his face that Ben knew only too well, inspected his client. He was allowing himself amusement that was impatient, but it was not quite derision. He was seeing a short, stout, or at least heavily built man - he was wearing a jacket too big for him - who must be at least forty. And that face! It was a broad face, with strongly delineated features, a mouth stretched in a grin - what did he think was so bloody funny? - a broad nose with flaring nostrils, eyes that were greenish, with sandy lashes, under bristly sandy brows. He had a short neat pointed beard that didn't fit with the face. His hair was yellow and seemed - like his grin - to shock and annoy, long, and falling forward in a slope, and in stiff locks on either side, as if trying to caricature a fashionable cut. To cap it all, he was using a posh voice; was he taking the mickey? The clerk was going in for this minute inspection because he was discommoded by Ben to the point of feeling angry. He sounded peevish when he said, 'You can't be eighteen. Come on, what's your real age?' </p> <p> Ben was silent. He was on the alert, every little bit of him, know- ing there was danger. He wished he had not come to this place, which could close its walls around him. He was listening to the noises from outside, for reassurance from his normality. Some pigeons were conversing in a plane tree on the pavement, and he was with them, thinking how they sat gripping twigs with pink claws that he could feel tightening around his own finger; they were contented, with the sun on their backs. Inside here, were sounds that he could not understand until he had isolated each one. Mean- while the young man in front of him was waiting, his hand holding the biro and fiddling it between his fingers. A telephone rang just beside him. On either side of him were several young men and women with that glass in front of them. Some used instruments that clicked and chattered, some stared at screens where words appeared and went. Each of these noisy machines Ben knew was probably hostile to him. Now he moved slightly to one side, to get rid of the reflections on the glass that were bothering him, and preventing him from properly seeing this person who was angry with him. </p> <p> 'Yes. I am eighteen,' he said. </p> <p> He knew he was. When he had gone to find his mother, three winters ago - he did not stay because his hated brother Paul had come in - she had written in large words on a piece of card: </p> <p> Your name is Ben Lovatt. <br> Your mother's name is Harriet Lovatt. <br> Your father's name is David Lovatt. <br> You have four brothers and sisters, Luke, Helen, Jane, and Paul. They are older than you. <br> You are fifteen years old.</p> <p> On the other side of the card had been: </p> <p> You were born .............. <br> Your home address is ............</p> <p> This card had afflicted Ben with such a despair of rage that he took it from his mother, and ran out of the house. He scribbled over the name Paul, first. Then, the other siblings. Then, the card falling to the floor and picked up showing the reverse side, he scribbled with his black biro over all the words there, leaving only a wild mess of lines. </p> <p> That number, fifteen, kept coming up in questions that were always - so he felt - being put to him. 'How old are you?' Knowing it was so important, he remembered it, and when the year turned around at Christmas, which no one could miss, he added a year. Now I am sixteen. Now I am seventeen. Now, because a third winter has gone, I am eighteen. 'OK, then, when were you born?' </p> <p> With every day since he had scribbled with that angry black pen all over the back of the card he had understood better what a mistake he had made. And he had destroyed the whole card, in a culminating fit of rage, because now it was useless. He knew his name. He knew 'Harriet' and 'David' and did not care about his brothers and sisters who wished he was dead. He did not remember when he was born. </p> <p> Listening, as he did, to every sound, he heard how the noises in that office were suddenly louder, because in a line of people waiting outside one of the glass panels, a woman had begun shout- ing at the clerk who was interviewing her, and because of this anger released into the air, all the lines began moving and shuffling, and other people were muttering, and then said aloud, like a barking, short angry words like Bastards, Shits - and these were words that Ben knew very well, and he was afraid of them. He felt the cold of fear moving down from the back of his neck to his spine. </p> <p> The man behind him was impatient, and said, 'I haven't got all day if you have.' </p> <p> 'When were you born? What date?' </p> <p> 'I don't know,' said Ben. </p> <p> And now the clerk put an end to it, postponing the problem, with, 'Go and find your birth certificate. Go to the Records Office. That'll settle it. You don't know your last employer. You don't have an address. You don't know your date of birth.' </p> <p> With these words his eyes left Ben's face, and he nodded at the man behind to come forward, displacing Ben, who went straight out of that office, feeling as if all the hairs of his body, the hairs on his head, were standing straight up, he was so trapped and afraid. Outside was a pavement, with people, a little street, full of cars, arm under the plane tree where the pigeons were moving about, cooing and complacent, a bench. He sat on it at the other end from a young woman who gave him a glance, but then another, frowned, and went off, looking back at him with that look on her face which Ben knew and expected. She was not afraid of him, but thought that she might be soon. Her body was all haste and apprehension, like one escaping. She went into a shop, glancing back. </p> <p> Ben was hungry. He had no money. There were some broken crusts on the ground, left for the pigeons. He gathered them up hastily, looking about him: he had been scolded for this before. Now an old man came to sit on the bench, and he gave Ben a long stare, but decided not to bother with what his instincts were telling him. He closed his eyes. The sun made a tiny bloom of sweat on the old face. Ben sat on, thinking how he must go back to the old woman, but she would be disappointed in him. She had told him to come to this office and claim unemployment benefit. The thought of her made him smile - a very different grin from the one that had annoyed the clerk. He sat smiling, a small smile that showed a gleam of teeth in his beard, and watched how the old man woke up, to wipe away the sweat that was running down his face, saying to the sweat, 'What? What's that?' as if it had reminded him of something. And then, to cover himself, he said sharply to Ben, 'What do you think you're laughing at?' </p> <p> Ben left the bench and the shade of the tree and the companion- ship of the pigeons, and walked through streets knowing he was going the right way, for about two miles. Now he was nearing a group of big blocks of flats. He went direct to one of them, and inside it, saw the lift come running down towards him, hissing and bumping, tried to make himself enter it, but his fear of lifts took him to the stairs. One, two, three... eleven flights of grey cold stairs, listening to the lift grumble and crash on the other side of a wall. On the landing were four doors. He went straight to one from where a rich meaty smell was coming, making his mouth fill with water. He turned the door knob, rattled it, and stood back to stare expectantly at the door, which opened. And there an old woman stood, smiling. 'Oh, Ben, there you are,' she said, and put her arm around him to pull him into the room. Inside he stood slightly crouched, darting looks everywhere, first of all to a large tabby cat that sat on a chair arm. Its fur was standing on end. The old woman went to it, and said, 'There, there, it's all right, puss,' and under her calming hand its terror abated, and it became a small neat cat. Now the old woman went to Ben, with the same words, 'There, Ben, it's all right, come and sit down.' Ben allowed his eyes to leave puss, but did not lose his wariness, sending glances in her direction. </p> <p> This room was where the old woman had her life. On a gas stove was a saucepan of meat stew, and it was this that Ben had smelled on the landing. 'It's all right, Ben,' she said again, and ladled stew into two bowls, put hunks of bread beside one, for Ben, set her own opposite him, and then spooned out a portion into a saucer for the cat, which she put on the floor by the chair. But the cat wasn't taking any chances: it sat quiet, its eyes fixed on Ben. </p> <p> Ben sat down, and his hands were already about to dig into the mound of meat, when he saw the old woman shake her head at him. He picked up a spoon and used it, conscious of every movement, being careful, eating tidily, though it was evident he was very hungry. The old woman ate a little, but mostly watched him, and when he had finished, she scraped out from the saucepan everything that was left of the stew, and put it on his plate. </p> <p> 'I wasn't expecting you,' she said, meaning that she would have made more. 'Fill up on bread,' </p> <p> Ben finished the stew, and then the bread. There was nothing else to eat except some cake, which she pushed towards him, but he ignored it. </p> <p> Now his attention was free, and she said, slowly, carefully, as if to a child, 'Ben, did you go to the office?' She had told him how to get there. 'Yes.' </p> <p> 'What happened?' </p> <p> 'They said, \"How old are you?\"' </p> <p> Here the old woman sighed, and put her hand to her face, rubbing it around there, as if wiping away difficult thoughts. She knew Ben was eighteen: he kept saying so. She believed him. It was the one fact he kept repeating. But she knew that was no eighteen-year-old, sitting there in front of her, and she had decided not to go on with the thoughts of what that meant. It's not my business - what he really is, sums up what she felt. Deep waters! Trouble! Keep out! </p> <p> He sat there like a dog expecting a rebuke, his teeth revealed in that other grin, which she knew and understood now, a stretched, teeth-showing grin that meant fear. </p> <p> 'Ben, you must go back to your mother and ask her for your birth certificate. She'll have it, I'm sure. It'd save you all the complications and the questions. You do remember how to get there?' </p> <p> 'Yes, I know that.' </p> <p> 'Well, I think you should go soon. Perhaps tomorrow?' </p> <p> Ben's eyes did not leave her face, taking in every little move- ment of eyes, mouth, her smile, her insistence. It was not the first time she had told him to go home to find his mother. He did not want to. But if she said he must... For him what was difficult was this: here there was friendship for him, warmth, kindness, and here, too, insistence that he must expose himself to pain and confusion, and danger. Ben's eyes did not leave that face, that smiling face, for him at this moment the bewildering face of the world. </p> <p> 'You see, Ben, I have to live on my pension. I have only so much money to live on. I want to help you. But if you got some money - that office would give you money - and that would help me. Do you understand, Ben?' Yes, he did. He knew money. He had learned that hard lesson. Without money you did not eat. </p> <p> And now, as if it was no great thing she wanted him to do, just a little thing, she said, 'Good, then that is settled.' </p> <p> She got up. 'Look, I've got something I think would be just right for you.' </p> <p> Folded over a chair was a jacket, which she had found in a charity shop, searching until there was one with wide shoulders. The jacket Ben had on was dirty, and torn, too. </p> <p> He took it off. The jacket she had found fitted his big shoulders and chest but was loose around the waist. 'Look, you can pull it in.' There was a belt, which she adjusted. And there were trousers, too. 'And now I want you to have a bath, Ben.' </p> <p> He took off the new jacket and his trousers, obedient, watching her all the time. </p> <p> 'I'm going to put away these trousers, Ben.' She did so. 'And I have got new underpants, and vests.' </p> <p> He was standing naked there, watching, while she went next door to a little bathroom. His nostrils flared, taking in the smell of water. Waiting, he checked all the smells in the room, the fading aromas of the good stew, a warm friendly smell; the bread, which smelled like a person; then a rank wild smell - the cat, still watching him; the smell of a slept-in bed, where the covers had been pulled up covering the pillows, which had a different smell. And he listened, too. The lift was silent, behind two walls. There was a rumbling in the sky, but he knew aeroplanes, was not afraid of them. The traffic down there he did not hear at all - he had shut it out of his awareness. </p> <p> The old woman came back, and said, 'Now, Ben.' He followed her, clambered into the water, and crouched in it. 'Do sit down,' she said. He hated the submission to the dangerous slipperiness, but now he was sitting in hot water to his waist. He shut his eyes, and with his teeth bared, this time in a grin of resignation, he let her wash him. He knew this washing was something he had to do, from time to time. It was expected of him. In fact he was beginning to enjoy water. </p> <p> Now the old woman, Ben's eyes no longer fastened on her face, allowed herself to show the curiosity she felt, which could never be assuaged - or indulged in. </p> <p> Under her hands was a strong broad back, with fringes of brown hair on either side of the backbone, and on the shoulders a mat of wet fur: it felt like that, as if she were washing a dog. On the upper arms there was hair, but not so much, not more than could be on an ordinary man. His chest was hairy, but it wasn't like fur, it was a man's chest. She handed him the soap but he let it slide into the water, and dug around furiously for it. She found it, and lathered him vigorously, and then used a little hand-shower to get it all off. He bounded out of the bath, and she made him go back, and she washed his thighs, his backside, and then, his genitals. He had no self-consciousness about these, and so she didn't either. And then, he could get out, which he did laughing, and shaking himself into the towel she held. She enjoyed hearing him laugh: it was like a bark. Long ago she had a dog who barked like that. </p> <p> She dried him, all over, and then led him back to the other room, naked, and made him put on his new underpants, his new vest, a charity shop shirt, his trousers. Then she put a towel around his shoulders and as he began to jerk about in protest, she said, 'Yes, Ben, you have to.' </p> <p> She trimmed his beard first. It was stiff and bristly, but she was able to make a good job of it. And now his hair, and that was a different matter, for it was coarse and thick.

She told him that one of these new clever hairdressers would make him look like a film star, but since he did not take this in, she amended it to, 'They could make you look so smart, Ben, you'd not know yourself.' </p> <p> But he didn't look too bad now, and he smelled clean.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/firstchapters/story/0,6761,333022,00.html\">Continued here</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "'How old are you?' 'Eighteen.' This reply did not come at once because Ben was afraid of what he knew was going to happen now, which was that the young man behind the glass protecting him from the public set down his biro on the form he was filling in, and then, with a look on his face that Ben knew only too well, inspected his client. He was allowing himself amusement that was impatient, but it was not quite derision. He was seeing a short, stout, or at least heavily built man - he was wearing a jacket too big for him - who must be at least forty. And that face! It was a broad face, with strongly delineated features, a mouth stretched in a grin - what did he think was so bloody funny? - a broad nose with flaring nostrils, eyes that were greenish, with sandy lashes, under bristly sandy brows. He had a short neat pointed beard that didn't fit with the face. His hair was yellow and seemed - like his grin - to shock and annoy, long, and falling forward in a slope, and in stiff locks on either side, as if trying to caricature a fashionable cut. To cap it all, he was using a posh voice; was he taking the mickey? The clerk was going in for this minute inspection because he was discommoded by Ben to the point of feeling angry. He sounded peevish when he said, 'You can't be eighteen. Come on, what's your real age?' Ben was silent. He was on the alert, every little bit of him, know- ing there was danger. He wished he had not come to this place, which could close its walls around him. He was listening to the noises from outside, for reassurance from his normality. Some pigeons were conversing in a plane tree on the pavement, and he was with them, thinking how they sat gripping twigs with pink claws that he could feel tightening around his own finger; they were contented, with the sun on their backs. Inside here, were sounds that he could not understand until he had isolated each one. Mean- while the young man in front of him was waiting, his hand holding the biro and fiddling it between his fingers. A telephone rang just beside him. On either side of him were several young men and women with that glass in front of them. Some used instruments that clicked and chattered, some stared at screens where words appeared and went. Each of these noisy machines Ben knew was probably hostile to him. Now he moved slightly to one side, to get rid of the reflections on the glass that were bothering him, and preventing him from properly seeing this person who was angry with him. 'Yes. I am eighteen,' he said. He knew he was. When he had gone to find his mother, three winters ago - he did not stay because his hated brother Paul had come in - she had written in large words on a piece of card: Your name is Ben Lovatt. Your mother's name is Harriet Lovatt. Your father's name is David Lovatt. You have four brothers and sisters, Luke, Helen, Jane, and Paul. They are older than you. You are fifteen years old. On the other side of the card had been: You were born .............. Your home address is ............ This card had afflicted Ben with such a despair of rage that he took it from his mother, and ran out of the house. He scribbled over the name Paul, first. Then, the other siblings. Then, the card falling to the floor and picked up showing the reverse side, he scribbled with his black biro over all the words there, leaving only a wild mess of lines. That number, fifteen, kept coming up in questions that were always - so he felt - being put to him. 'How old are you?' Knowing it was so important, he remembered it, and when the year turned around at Christmas, which no one could miss, he added a year. Now I am sixteen. Now I am seventeen. Now, because a third winter has gone, I am eighteen. 'OK, then, when were you born?' With every day since he had scribbled with that angry black pen all over the back of the card he had understood better what a mistake he had made. And he had destroyed the whole card, in a culminating fit of rage, because now it was useless. He knew his name. He knew 'Harriet' and 'David' and did not care about his brothers and sisters who wished he was dead. He did not remember when he was born. Listening, as he did, to every sound, he heard how the noises in that office were suddenly louder, because in a line of people waiting outside one of the glass panels, a woman had begun shout- ing at the clerk who was interviewing her, and because of this anger released into the air, all the lines began moving and shuffling, and other people were muttering, and then said aloud, like a barking, short angry words like Bastards, Shits - and these were words that Ben knew very well, and he was afraid of them. He felt the cold of fear moving down from the back of his neck to his spine. The man behind him was impatient, and said, 'I haven't got all day if you have.' 'When were you born? What date?' 'I don't know,' said Ben. And now the clerk put an end to it, postponing the problem, with, 'Go and find your birth certificate. Go to the Records Office. That'll settle it. You don't know your last employer. You don't have an address. You don't know your date of birth.' With these words his eyes left Ben's face, and he nodded at the man behind to come forward, displacing Ben, who went straight out of that office, feeling as if all the hairs of his body, the hairs on his head, were standing straight up, he was so trapped and afraid. Outside was a pavement, with people, a little street, full of cars, arm under the plane tree where the pigeons were moving about, cooing and complacent, a bench. He sat on it at the other end from a young woman who gave him a glance, but then another, frowned, and went off, looking back at him with that look on her face which Ben knew and expected. She was not afraid of him, but thought that she might be soon. Her body was all haste and apprehension, like one escaping. She went into a shop, glancing back. Ben was hungry. He had no money. There were some broken crusts on the ground, left for the pigeons. He gathered them up hastily, looking about him: he had been scolded for this before. Now an old man came to sit on the bench, and he gave Ben a long stare, but decided not to bother with what his instincts were telling him. He closed his eyes. The sun made a tiny bloom of sweat on the old face. Ben sat on, thinking how he must go back to the old woman, but she would be disappointed in him. She had told him to come to this office and claim unemployment benefit. The thought of her made him smile - a very different grin from the one that had annoyed the clerk. He sat smiling, a small smile that showed a gleam of teeth in his beard, and watched how the old man woke up, to wipe away the sweat that was running down his face, saying to the sweat, 'What? What's that?' as if it had reminded him of something. And then, to cover himself, he said sharply to Ben, 'What do you think you're laughing at?' Ben left the bench and the shade of the tree and the companion- ship of the pigeons, and walked through streets knowing he was going the right way, for about two miles. Now he was nearing a group of big blocks of flats. He went direct to one of them, and inside it, saw the lift come running down towards him, hissing and bumping, tried to make himself enter it, but his fear of lifts took him to the stairs. One, two, three... eleven flights of grey cold stairs, listening to the lift grumble and crash on the other side of a wall. On the landing were four doors. He went straight to one from where a rich meaty smell was coming, making his mouth fill with water. He turned the door knob, rattled it, and stood back to stare expectantly at the door, which opened. And there an old woman stood, smiling. 'Oh, Ben, there you are,' she said, and put her arm around him to pull him into the room. Inside he stood slightly crouched, darting looks everywhere, first of all to a large tabby cat that sat on a chair arm. Its fur was standing on end. The old woman went to it, and said, 'There, there, it's all right, puss,' and under her calming hand its terror abated, and it became a small neat cat. Now the old woman went to Ben, with the same words, 'There, Ben, it's all right, come and sit down.' Ben allowed his eyes to leave puss, but did not lose his wariness, sending glances in her direction. This room was where the old woman had her life. On a gas stove was a saucepan of meat stew, and it was this that Ben had smelled on the landing. 'It's all right, Ben,' she said again, and ladled stew into two bowls, put hunks of bread beside one, for Ben, set her own opposite him, and then spooned out a portion into a saucer for the cat, which she put on the floor by the chair. But the cat wasn't taking any chances: it sat quiet, its eyes fixed on Ben. Ben sat down, and his hands were already about to dig into the mound of meat, when he saw the old woman shake her head at him. He picked up a spoon and used it, conscious of every movement, being careful, eating tidily, though it was evident he was very hungry. The old woman ate a little, but mostly watched him, and when he had finished, she scraped out from the saucepan everything that was left of the stew, and put it on his plate. 'I wasn't expecting you,' she said, meaning that she would have made more. 'Fill up on bread,' Ben finished the stew, and then the bread. There was nothing else to eat except some cake, which she pushed towards him, but he ignored it. Now his attention was free, and she said, slowly, carefully, as if to a child, 'Ben, did you go to the office?' She had told him how to get there. 'Yes.' 'What happened?' 'They said, \"How old are you?\"' Here the old woman sighed, and put her hand to her face, rubbing it around there, as if wiping away difficult thoughts. She knew Ben was eighteen: he kept saying so. She believed him. It was the one fact he kept repeating. But she knew that was no eighteen-year-old, sitting there in front of her, and she had decided not to go on with the thoughts of what that meant. It's not my business - what he really is, sums up what she felt. Deep waters! Trouble! Keep out! He sat there like a dog expecting a rebuke, his teeth revealed in that other grin, which she knew and understood now, a stretched, teeth-showing grin that meant fear. 'Ben, you must go back to your mother and ask her for your birth certificate. She'll have it, I'm sure. It'd save you all the complications and the questions. You do remember how to get there?' 'Yes, I know that.' 'Well, I think you should go soon. Perhaps tomorrow?' Ben's eyes did not leave her face, taking in every little move- ment of eyes, mouth, her smile, her insistence. It was not the first time she had told him to go home to find his mother. He did not want to. But if she said he must... For him what was difficult was this: here there was friendship for him, warmth, kindness, and here, too, insistence that he must expose himself to pain and confusion, and danger. Ben's eyes did not leave that face, that smiling face, for him at this moment the bewildering face of the world. 'You see, Ben, I have to live on my pension. I have only so much money to live on. I want to help you. But if you got some money - that office would give you money - and that would help me. Do you understand, Ben?' Yes, he did. He knew money. He had learned that hard lesson. Without money you did not eat. And now, as if it was no great thing she wanted him to do, just a little thing, she said, 'Good, then that is settled.' She got up. 'Look, I've got something I think would be just right for you.' Folded over a chair was a jacket, which she had found in a charity shop, searching until there was one with wide shoulders. The jacket Ben had on was dirty, and torn, too. He took it off. The jacket she had found fitted his big shoulders and chest but was loose around the waist. 'Look, you can pull it in.' There was a belt, which she adjusted. And there were trousers, too. 'And now I want you to have a bath, Ben.' He took off the new jacket and his trousers, obedient, watching her all the time. 'I'm going to put away these trousers, Ben.' She did so. 'And I have got new underpants, and vests.' He was standing naked there, watching, while she went next door to a little bathroom. His nostrils flared, taking in the smell of water. Waiting, he checked all the smells in the room, the fading aromas of the good stew, a warm friendly smell; the bread, which smelled like a person; then a rank wild smell - the cat, still watching him; the smell of a slept-in bed, where the covers had been pulled up covering the pillows, which had a different smell. And he listened, too. The lift was silent, behind two walls. There was a rumbling in the sky, but he knew aeroplanes, was not afraid of them. The traffic down there he did not hear at all - he had shut it out of his awareness. The old woman came back, and said, 'Now, Ben.' He followed her, clambered into the water, and crouched in it. 'Do sit down,' she said. He hated the submission to the dangerous slipperiness, but now he was sitting in hot water to his waist. He shut his eyes, and with his teeth bared, this time in a grin of resignation, he let her wash him. He knew this washing was something he had to do, from time to time. It was expected of him.

      "body": "<p>On a lucky afternoon I happened upon The Devil in Massachusetts, by Marion Starkey, a narrative of the Salem witch-hunt of 1692. I knew this story from my college reading, but in this darkened America it turned a completely new aspect toward me: the poetry of the hunt. Poetry may seem an odd word for a witch-hunt but I saw there was something of the marvellous in the spectacle of a whole village, if not an entire province, whose imagination was captured by a vision of something that wasn't there. </p> <p>In time to come, the notion of equating the red-hunt with the witch-hunt would be condemned as a deception. There were communists and there never were witches. The deeper I moved into the 1690s, the further away drifted the America of the 50s, and, rather than the appeal of analogy, I found something different to draw my curiosity and excitement. </p> <p>Anyone standing up in the Salem of 1692 and denying that witches existed would have faced immediate arrest, the hardest interrogation and possibly the rope. Every authority not only confirmed the existence of witches but never questioned the necessity of executing them. It became obvious that to dismiss witchcraft was to forgo any understanding of how it came to pass that tens of thousands had been murdered as witches in Europe. To dismiss any relation between that episode and the hunt for subversives was to shut down an insight into not only the similar emotions but also the identical practices of both officials and victims.</p> <p> There were witches, if not to most of us then certainly to everyone in Salem; and there were communists, but what was the content of their menace? That to me became the issue. Having been deeply influenced as a student by a Marxist approach to society, and having known Marxists and sympathisers, I could simply not accept that these people were spies or even prepared to do the will of the Soviets in some future crisis. That such people had thought to find hope of a higher ethic in the Soviet was not simply an American, but a worldwide, irony of catastrophic moral proportions, for their like could be found all over the world.</p> <p> But as the 50s dawned, they were stuck with the past. Part of the surreality of the anti-left sweep was that it picked up people for disgrace who had already turned away from a pro-Soviet past but had no stomach for naming others who had merely shared their illusions. But the hunt had captured some significant part of the American imagination and its power demanded respect. </p> <p>Turning to Salem was like looking into a petri dish, an embalmed stasis with its principal moving forces caught in stillness. One had to wonder what the human imagination fed on that could inspire neighbours and old friends to emerge overnight as furies secretly bent on the torture and destruction of Christians. More than a political metaphor, more than a moral tale, The Crucible, as it developed over more than a year, became the awesome evidence of the power of human imagination inflamed, the poetry of suggestion, and the tragedy of heroic resistance to a society possessed to the point of ruin. </p> <p>In the stillness of the Salem courthouse, surrounded by the images of the 1950s but with my head in 1692, what the two eras had in common gradually gained definition. Both had the menace of concealed plots, but most startling were the similarities in the rituals of defence, the investigative routines; 300 years apart, both prosecutions alleged membership of a secret, disloyal group. Should the accused confess, his honesty could only be proved by naming former confederates. The informer became the axle of the plot's existence and the investigation's necessity. </p> <p>The witch-hunt in 1692 had a not dissimilar problem, but a far more poetic solution. Most suspected people named by others as members of the Devil's conspiracy had not been shown to have done anything, neither poisoning wells, setting barns on fire, sickening cattle, aborting babies, nor undermining the virtue of wives (the Devil having two phenomenally active penises, one above the other). </p> <p>To the rescue came a piece of poetry, smacking of both legalistic and religious validity, called Spectral Evidence. All the prosecution need do was produce a witness who claimed to have seen, not an accused person, but his familiar spirit - his living ghost - in the act of throwing a burning brand into a barn full of hay. You could be at home asleep in your bed, but your spirit could be crawling through your neighbour's window to feel up his wife. The owner of the wandering spirit was obliged to account to the court for his crime. With Spectral Evidence, the air filled with the malign spirits of those identified by good Christians as confederates of theBeast, and the Devil himself danced happily into Salem village and took the place apart. </p> <p>I spent 10 days in Salem courthouse reading the crudely recorded trials of the 1692 outbreak, and it was striking how totally absent was any sense of irony, let alone humour. I can't recall if it was the provincial governor's nephew or son who, with a college friend, came from Boston to watch the strange proceedings. Both boys burst out laughing at some absurd testimony: they were promptly jailed, and faced possible hanging. </p> <p>Irony and humour were not conspicuous in the 1950s either. I was in my lawyer's office to sign some contract and a lawyer in the next office was asked to come in and notarise my signature.

A mystifying, unprecedented outbreak of gang violence had exploded all over New York. The city, in return for a good percentage of profits, had contracted with this producer to open police stations and schools to his camera. I spent the summer of 1955 in Brooklyn streets with two gangs and wrote an outline. I was ready to proceed with the script when an attack on me as a disloyal lefty opened in the New York World Telegram. The cry went up that the city must cancel its contract with the producer so long as I was the screenwriter. A hearing was arranged, attended by 22 city commissioners, including the police, fire, welfare and sanitation departments, as well as two judges. </p> <p>At the conference table there also sat a lady who produced a thick folder of petitions and statements I had signed, going back to my college years, provided to her by the Huac. I defended myself; I thought I was making sense when the lady began screaming that I was killing the boys in Korea [this was during the Korean war]. She meant me personally, as I could tell from the froth at the corners of her mouth, the fury in her eyes, and her finger pointing straight into my face. </p> <p>The vote was taken and came up one short of continuing the city's collaboration, and the film was killed that afternoon. I always wondered whether the crucial vote against me came from the sanitation department. But it was not a total loss; the suffocating sensation of helplessness before the spectacle of the impossible coming to pass would soon help in writing The Crucible. </p> <p>That impossible coming to pass was not an observation made at a comfortable distance but a blade cutting directly into my life. This was especially the case with Elia Kazan's decision to cooperate with the Huac. The surrounding fears felt even by those with the most fleeting of contacts with any communist-supported organisation were enough to break through long associations and friendships. </p> <p>Kazan had been a member of the Communist party only a matter of months, and even that link had ended years before. And the party had never been illegal, nor was membership in it. Yet this great director, left undefended by 20th Century Fox executives, his longtime employers, was told that if he refused to name people whom he had known in the party - actors, directors and writers - he would never be allowed to direct another picture in Hollywood, meaning the end of his career. </p> <p>These names were already known to the committee through other testifiers and FBI informants, but exactly as in Salem - or Russia under the Czar and the Chairman, and Inquisition Spain, Revolutionary France or any other place of revolution or counter-revolution - conspiracy was the name for all opposition. And the reformation of the accused could only be believed when he gave up the names of his co-conspirators. Only this ritual of humiliation, the breaking of pride and independence, could win the accused readmission into the community. The process inevitably did produce in the accused a new set of political, social and even moral convictions more acceptable to the state whose fist had been shoved into his face, with his utter ruin promised should he resist. </p> <p>I had stopped by Kazan's house in the country in 1952 after he had called me to come and talk, an unusual invitation - he had never been inclined to indulge in talk unless it concerned work. I had suspected from his dark tone that it must have to do with the Huac, which was rampaging through the Hollywood ranks . </p> <p>Since I was on my way up to Salem for research on a play that I was still unsure I would write, I called at his house, which was on my route. As he laid out his dilemma and his decision to comply with the Huac (which he had already done) it was impossible not to feel his anguish, old friends that we were. But the crunch came when I felt fear, that great teacher, that cruel revealer. For it swept over me that, had I been one of his comrades, he would have spent my name as part of the guarantee of his reform. Even so, oddly enough, I was not filling up with hatred or contempt for him; his suffering was too palpable. The whole hateful procedure had brought him to this, and I believe made the writing of The Crucible all but inevitable. Even if one could grant Kazan sincerity in his new-found anti-communism, the concept of an America where such self-discoveries were pressed out of people was outrageous, and a contradiction of any concept of personal liberty. </p> <p>Is all this of some objective importance in our history, this destruction of bonds between people? I think it may be, however personal it may appear. Kazan's testimony created a far greater shock than anyone else's. Lee J Cobb's similar testimony and Jerome Robbins's cooperation seemed hardly to matter. It may be that Kazan had been loved more than any other, that he had attracted far greater affection from writers and actors with whom he had worked, and so what was overtly a political act was sensed as a betrayal of love. </p> <p>It is very significant that in the uproar set off by last year's award to Kazan of an Oscar for life achievement, one heard no mention of the name of any member of the Huac. One doubted whether the thought occurred to many people that the studio heads had ignominiously collapsed before the Huac's insistence that they institute a blacklist of artists, something they had once insisted was dishonourable and a violation of democratic norms. Half a century had passed since his testimony, but Kazan bore very nearly the whole onus of the era, as though he had manufactured its horrors - when he was surely its victim. </p> <p>The trial record in Salem courthouse had been written by ministers in a primitive shorthand. This condensation gave emphasis to a gnarled, densely packed language which suggested the country accents of a hard people. To lose oneself day after day in that record of human delusion was to know a fear, not for one's safety, but of the spectacle of intelligent people giving themselves over to a rapture of murderous credulity. It was as though the absence of real evidence was itself a release from the burdens of this world; in love with the invisible, they moved behind their priests, closer to that mystical communion which is anarchy and is called God. </p> <p>Evidence, in contrast, is effort; leaping to conclusions is a wonderful pleasure, and for a while there was a highly charged joy in Salem, for now that they could see through everything to the frightful plot that was daily being laid bare in court sessions, their days, formerly so eventless and long, were swallowed up in hourly revelations, news, surprises. The Crucible is less a polemic than it might have been had it not been filled with wonder at the protean imagination of man. </p> <p>The Crucible straddles two different worlds to make them one, but it is not history in the usual sense of the word, but a moral, political and psychological construct that floats on the fluid emotions of both eras. As a commercial entertainment the play failed [it opened in 1953]. To start with there was the title: nobody knew what a crucible was. Most of the critics, as sometimes does happen, never caught on to the play's ironical substructure, and the ones who did were nervous about validating a work that was so unkind to the same sanctified procedural principles as underlay the hunt for reds. Some old acquaintances gave me distant nods in the theatre lobby on opening night, and even without air-conditioning the house was cool. There was also a problem with the temperature of the production. </p> <p>The director, Jed Harris, a great name in the theatre of the 20s, 30s and 40s, had decided that the play, which he believed a classic, should be staged like a Dutch painting. In Dutch paintings of groups, everyone is always looking front. Unfortunately, on a stage such rigidity can only lead an audience to the exits. Several years after, a gang of young actors, setting up chairs in the ballroom of the McAlpin Hotel, fired up the audience, convinced the critics, and the play at last took off and soon found its place. There were cheering reviews but by then Senator McCarthy was dead. The public fever on whose heatwaves he had spread his wings had subsided. </p> <p>The Crucible is my most-produced play. It seems to be one of the few surviving shards of the so-called McCarthy period. And it is part of the play's history that, to people in so many parts of the world, its story seems to be their own. I used to think, half seriously, that you could tell when a dictator was about to take power, or had been overthrown, in a Latin American country, if The Crucible was suddenly being produced in that country. </p> <p>The result of it all is that I have come, rather reluctantly, to respect delusion, not least of all my own. There are no passions quite as hot and pleasurable as those of the deluded. Compared to the bliss of delusion, its vivid colours, blazing lights, explosions, whistles and liberating joys, the search for evidence is a deadly bore. My heart was with the left. if only because the right hated me enough to want to kill me, as the Germans amply proved. And now, the most blatant and most foul anti-semitism is in Russia, leaving people like me filled not so much with surprise as a kind of wonder at the incredible amount of hope there once was, and how it disappeared and whether in time it will ever come again, attached, no doubt, to some new illusion. </p> <p>There is hardly a week that passes when I don't ask the unanswerable question: what am I now convinced of that will turn out to be ridiculous? And yet one can't forever stand on the shore; at some point, filled with indecision, scepticism, reservation and doubt, you either jump in or concede that life is forever elsewhere.

And for people wherever the play is performed on any of the five continents, there is always a certain amazement that the same terror that is happening to them or that is threatening them, has happened before to others. It is all very strange.

      "bodyText": "On a lucky afternoon I happened upon The Devil in Massachusetts, by Marion Starkey, a narrative of the Salem witch-hunt of 1692. I knew this story from my college reading, but in this darkened America it turned a completely new aspect toward me: the poetry of the hunt. Poetry may seem an odd word for a witch-hunt but I saw there was something of the marvellous in the spectacle of a whole village, if not an entire province, whose imagination was captured by a vision of something that wasn't there. In time to come, the notion of equating the red-hunt with the witch-hunt would be condemned as a deception. There were communists and there never were witches. The deeper I moved into the 1690s, the further away drifted the America of the 50s, and, rather than the appeal of analogy, I found something different to draw my curiosity and excitement. Anyone standing up in the Salem of 1692 and denying that witches existed would have faced immediate arrest, the hardest interrogation and possibly the rope. Every authority not only confirmed the existence of witches but never questioned the necessity of executing them. It became obvious that to dismiss witchcraft was to forgo any understanding of how it came to pass that tens of thousands had been murdered as witches in Europe. To dismiss any relation between that episode and the hunt for subversives was to shut down an insight into not only the similar emotions but also the identical practices of both officials and victims. There were witches, if not to most of us then certainly to everyone in Salem; and there were communists, but what was the content of their menace? That to me became the issue. Having been deeply influenced as a student by a Marxist approach to society, and having known Marxists and sympathisers, I could simply not accept that these people were spies or even prepared to do the will of the Soviets in some future crisis. That such people had thought to find hope of a higher ethic in the Soviet was not simply an American, but a worldwide, irony of catastrophic moral proportions, for their like could be found all over the world. But as the 50s dawned, they were stuck with the past. Part of the surreality of the anti-left sweep was that it picked up people for disgrace who had already turned away from a pro-Soviet past but had no stomach for naming others who had merely shared their illusions. But the hunt had captured some significant part of the American imagination and its power demanded respect. Turning to Salem was like looking into a petri dish, an embalmed stasis with its principal moving forces caught in stillness. One had to wonder what the human imagination fed on that could inspire neighbours and old friends to emerge overnight as furies secretly bent on the torture and destruction of Christians. More than a political metaphor, more than a moral tale, The Crucible, as it developed over more than a year, became the awesome evidence of the power of human imagination inflamed, the poetry of suggestion, and the tragedy of heroic resistance to a society possessed to the point of ruin. In the stillness of the Salem courthouse, surrounded by the images of the 1950s but with my head in 1692, what the two eras had in common gradually gained definition. Both had the menace of concealed plots, but most startling were the similarities in the rituals of defence, the investigative routines; 300 years apart, both prosecutions alleged membership of a secret, disloyal group. Should the accused confess, his honesty could only be proved by naming former confederates. The informer became the axle of the plot's existence and the investigation's necessity. The witch-hunt in 1692 had a not dissimilar problem, but a far more poetic solution. Most suspected people named by others as members of the Devil's conspiracy had not been shown to have done anything, neither poisoning wells, setting barns on fire, sickening cattle, aborting babies, nor undermining the virtue of wives (the Devil having two phenomenally active penises, one above the other). To the rescue came a piece of poetry, smacking of both legalistic and religious validity, called Spectral Evidence. All the prosecution need do was produce a witness who claimed to have seen, not an accused person, but his familiar spirit - his living ghost - in the act of throwing a burning brand into a barn full of hay. You could be at home asleep in your bed, but your spirit could be crawling through your neighbour's window to feel up his wife. The owner of the wandering spirit was obliged to account to the court for his crime. With Spectral Evidence, the air filled with the malign spirits of those identified by good Christians as confederates of theBeast, and the Devil himself danced happily into Salem village and took the place apart. I spent 10 days in Salem courthouse reading the crudely recorded trials of the 1692 outbreak, and it was striking how totally absent was any sense of irony, let alone humour. I can't recall if it was the provincial governor's nephew or son who, with a college friend, came from Boston to watch the strange proceedings. Both boys burst out laughing at some absurd testimony: they were promptly jailed, and faced possible hanging. Irony and humour were not conspicuous in the 1950s either. I was in my lawyer's office to sign some contract and a lawyer in the next office was asked to come in and notarise my signature. While he was stamping pages, I continued a discussion with my lawyer about the Broadway theatre, which I said was corrupt; the art of theatre had been totally displaced by the bottom line, all that mattered any more. Looking up at me, the notarising lawyer said, \"That's a communist position, you know.\" I started to laugh until I saw the constraint in my lawyer's face, and I quickly sobered up. I am glad that I managed to write The Crucible, but looking back I have often wished I'd had the temperament to do an absurd comedy, which is what the situation deserved. Now, after more than three-quarters of a century of fascination with the great snake of political and social developments, I can see more than a few occasions when we were confronted by the same sensation of having stepped into another age.

      "body": "<b>Dear Christov,</b> <br> You know I think that Holland were the best team of the 1998 soccer world cup. I cheered France's victory, too - though we now know their triumph owed much to Ronaldo's seizure before the game. Can you really insist that it's only the winning that matters? If this is true, it means there is no place for grace, beauty, or creativity. It means that in 1982, the gruesome West Germans - whose goalkeeper Schumacher committed the worst foul in the history of the sport on France's Battiston - were \"better\" than the French team of Platini, Tigana, Giresse and Trsor. It means that Maradona's \"hand of God\" goal in 1986 was the equal of his miraculous second. But I know you can't really be suggesting this. You're a nice guy and I sense you have poetry in your soul. Winning cannot be the only thing that counts in football. Take care, <br> David Winner <br> Author, Brilliant Orange: The Neurotic Genius of Dutch Football (Bloomsbury) <br> <br> <br> <p><b>Dear David,</b><br><br> For many kids, football begins with kicking empty cans outside their front doors. But already they are looking to win the game. At all levels football has always been about winning. Why? Because winning is the only way we have found to rate our teams. We have all witnessed some terrific individual players and sides - but only a handful of teams have won the World Cup. Doesn't that make them the greatest? Any real lover of the game understands what it means for a team to lift the supreme trophy. Not only does it change the players' lives for ever, it changes a nation's history. <br><br> It is such a prize that losing a final can be a national tragedy - Italy in 1994, for example. And as far as I remember, none of the Brazilian finalists of 1998 used Ronaldo's misfortune as an excuse. Footballers know the score: they accept defeat as part of the game.<br><br> Could it be, David, that you have only ever been a romantic spectator of the game, and have never felt the urgency of scoring a goal when your team is about to lose? Losing despite playing beautifully is the worst outcome, be it for fans, players, or managers; ask Terry Venables. Ask Paul Gascoigne. <br><br> Best wishes,<br> Christov Ruhn<br> Editor, Le Foot: The Legends of French Football (Little, Brown)<br><br><br></p> <p><b>Dear Christov,</b><br><br> Of course winning is important. And losing is always painful. All I'm saying is that it isn't the only way we have found to rate our teams. We use other criteria all the time. This is partly because the scoring system in football doesn't mirror the balance of a game. In tennis, it's almost impossible to outplay an opponent and lose. But in football it often happens.<br><br> Many games turn on referees' mistakes. Decisive goals are wrongly allowed or disallowed; penalties falsely awarded or denied. England won the World Cup with the aid of a goal that never crossed the line. Hence the expression \"the best team lost\". When Bill Shankly said \"the best side drew\", we knew what he meant. Romantics love to win as much as anyone else; the pain we suffer when a beautiful team loses is because of the discrepancy between the actual result and a fair result.<br><br> Many of the most thrilling moments in football have nothing to do with winning or losing.

      "bodyText": "Dear Christov, You know I think that Holland were the best team of the 1998 soccer world cup. I cheered France's victory, too - though we now know their triumph owed much to Ronaldo's seizure before the game. Can you really insist that it's only the winning that matters? If this is true, it means there is no place for grace, beauty, or creativity. It means that in 1982, the gruesome West Germans - whose goalkeeper Schumacher committed the worst foul in the history of the sport on France's Battiston - were \"better\" than the French team of Platini, Tigana, Giresse and Trsor. It means that Maradona's \"hand of God\" goal in 1986 was the equal of his miraculous second. But I know you can't really be suggesting this. You're a nice guy and I sense you have poetry in your soul. Winning cannot be the only thing that counts in football. Take care, David Winner Author, Brilliant Orange: The Neurotic Genius of Dutch Football (Bloomsbury) Dear David, For many kids, football begins with kicking empty cans outside their front doors. But already they are looking to win the game. At all levels football has always been about winning. Why? Because winning is the only way we have found to rate our teams. We have all witnessed some terrific individual players and sides - but only a handful of teams have won the World Cup. Doesn't that make them the greatest? Any real lover of the game understands what it means for a team to lift the supreme trophy. Not only does it change the players' lives for ever, it changes a nation's history. It is such a prize that losing a final can be a national tragedy - Italy in 1994, for example. And as far as I remember, none of the Brazilian finalists of 1998 used Ronaldo's misfortune as an excuse. Footballers know the score: they accept defeat as part of the game. Could it be, David, that you have only ever been a romantic spectator of the game, and have never felt the urgency of scoring a goal when your team is about to lose? Losing despite playing beautifully is the worst outcome, be it for fans, players, or managers; ask Terry Venables. Ask Paul Gascoigne. Best wishes, Christov Ruhn Editor, Le Foot: The Legends of French Football (Little, Brown) Dear Christov, Of course winning is important. And losing is always painful. All I'm saying is that it isn't the only way we have found to rate our teams. We use other criteria all the time. This is partly because the scoring system in football doesn't mirror the balance of a game. In tennis, it's almost impossible to outplay an opponent and lose. But in football it often happens. Many games turn on referees' mistakes. Decisive goals are wrongly allowed or disallowed; penalties falsely awarded or denied. England won the World Cup with the aid of a goal that never crossed the line. Hence the expression \"the best team lost\". When Bill Shankly said \"the best side drew\", we knew what he meant. Romantics love to win as much as anyone else; the pain we suffer when a beautiful team loses is because of the discrepancy between the actual result and a fair result. Many of the most thrilling moments in football have nothing to do with winning or losing. Pele dummied the Uruguayan goalkeeper but missed the goal. We never tire of watching Johann Cruyff's turn against Sweden in 1974, and have forgotten that he did it during a 0-0 draw. To insist that the result is the only measure of value in football is to view the game like an accountant. It's like saying Elton John's Candle in the Wind is a \"better\" piece of music than Mozart's Requiem because it sold in greater quantities. Take care, David Dear David, Music is an art, but, much as I love it, football is not. Football thrives on the emotions brought by victory, shared by millions of people.

      "body": "<p>It was early evening and she did what she would have done alone: she brought out cans of beer from her fridge, filled her glass, and then she filled one for him. They were going to spend the evening doing what he liked best, watching television. </p> <p> First she found a piece of paper and wrote on it: </p> <p> Mrs Ellen Biggs <br> 11 Mimosa House <br> Halley Street, London SE6.</p> <p> She said, 'Ask your mother for your birth certificate. If she has to send for it, then tell her she can always write to you care of me - and here is the address.' </p> <p> He did not answer: he was frowning. </p> <p> 'Do you understand, Ben?' </p> <p> 'Yes.' </p> <p> She did not know whether he did or not, but thought so. </p> <p> He was looking at the television. She got up, switched it on, and came back by way of the cat. 'There, there puss, it's all right.' But the cat never for one moment took its eyes off Ben. </p> <p> And now it was an easy pleasant evening. He did not seem to mind what he saw. Sometimes she switched to another channel, thinking he was bored. He did like wildlife programmes, but there wasn't one tonight. This was a good thing, really, because he sometimes got too excited: she knew wild instincts had been aroused. She had understood from the start that he was controlling instincts she could only guess at. Poor Ben - she knew he was that, but not how, or why. </p> <p> At bedtime she unrolled on to the floor the futon he slept on, and put blankets beside it in case: he usually did not use coverings. The cat, seeing that this enemy was on the floor, leaped up on to the bed and lay close against the old woman's side. From there she could not watch Ben, but it was all right, she felt safe. When the lights were off the room was not really dark, because there was a moon that night. </p> <p> The old woman listened for Ben's breathing to change into what she called his night breathing. It was, she thought, like listening to a story, events or adventures that possibly the cat would understand. In his sleep Ben ran from enemies, hunted, fought. She knew he was not human: 'not one of us' as she put it. Perhaps he was a kind of yeti. When she had seen him first, in a supermarket, he was prowling - there was only that word for it - as he reached out to grab up loaves of bread. She had had a glimpse of him then, the wild man, and she had never forgotten it. He was a controlled explosion of furious needs, hungers and frustrations, and she knew that even as she said to the attendant, 'It's all right, he is with me.' She handed him a pie she had just bought for her lunch, and he was eating it as she led him out of the place. She took him home, and fed him. She washed him, though he had protested that first time. She saw how he reacted to some cold meat - quite alarming it was; but she bought extra meat for him. It was just here where he was most different; meat, he could not get enough. And she was an old woman, eating a little bit of this here, a snack there - an apple, cheese, cake, a sandwich. The stew that day had been just luck: she ate that kind of meal so seldom. </p> <p> One night, when the three of them had gone to bed, and to sleep, she had woken because of a pressure along her legs. Ben had crept up and laid himself down, his head near her feet, his legs bent. It was the cat's distress that had woken her. But Ben was asleep. It was how a dog lays itself down, close, for company, and her heart ached, knowing his loneliness. In the morning he woke embarrassed. He seemed to think he had done wrong, but she said, 'It's all right, Ben. There's plenty of room.' It was a big bed, the one she had had when she was married. </p> <p> She thought that he was like an intelligent dog, always trying to anticipate wants and commands. Not like a cat at all: that was a different kind of sensitivity. And he was not like a monkey, for he was slow and heavy. Not like anything she had known. He was Ben, he was himself - whatever that was. She was pleased he was going to find his family. He was hardly communicative, but she had gathered it was a well-off family. And there was his accent which was not what you'd expect, from how he looked. He seemed to like his mother. If she herself could be good to Ben - so Ellen Biggs saw it - then his family could too. But if it didn't work, and he turned up here again, then she would go with him to the Public Records Office and find out about his age. She was so confused about this she had given up trying to puzzle it out. He repeated that he was eighteen, and she had to believe him. In many ways he was childish, and yet when she took a good look at that face she could even think him middle-aged, with those lines around his eyes. Little ones, but still: no eighteen-year- old could have them. She had actually gone so far in her thoughts to wonder if the people he belonged to, whoever they were, matured early, in which case they would die young, according to our ideas. Middle-aged at twenty, and old at forty, whereas she, Ellen Biggs, was eighty and only just beginning to feel her age to the point that she hoped she would not have to make that annoying journey to the Records Office, and then stand in a line: the thought made her tired and cross. She fell asleep, listen- ing to Ben dream, and woke to find him gone. The paper with her address had gone, and the ten-pound note she had left for him. Although she had expected it, now she had to sit down, her hand pressing on a troubled heart. Since he had come into her life, weeks ago, foreboding had come too. Sitting alone when he had gone off somewhere she was thinking, Where's Ben? What is he doing? Was he being cheated again? Far too often had she heard from him, 'They took my money,' - 'They stole everything.' The trouble was, information came out of him in a jumble. </p> <p> 'When was that, Ben?' </p> <p> 'It was summer.' </p> <p> 'No, I mean, what year?' </p> <p> 'I don't know. It was after the farm.' </p> <p> 'And when was that?' </p> <p> 'I was there two winters.' </p> <p> She knew he was about fourteen when he left his family. So what had he been doing for four years? </p> <p> His mother had been wrong, thinking he had gone right away. He and his gang of truants from school were camping in an empty house on the edge of their town, and from there made forays, shoplifting, breaking into shops at night, and at weekends went to nearby towns to hang about the streets with the local youths, hoping for a fight and some fun. Ben was their leader because he was so strong, and stood up for them. So they thought, but really the reason was that inwardly he was mature, he was a grown man, more of a parent, whereas they were still children. One by one they were caught, sent to borstal, or returned to parents and school. One evening he was standing on the edge of a crowd of fighting youngsters - he did not fight, he was afraid of his strength, his rage - and he realised he was alone, without companions. For a while he was one of a gang of much older youths, but he did not dominate them as he had the young ones. They forced him to steal for them, made fun of him, jeered at his posh accent. He left them and drifted down to the West Country where he fell in with a motorbike gang, which was engaged in warfare with a rival gang. He longed to drive a motorcyde, but could not get the hang of it. But it was enough to be near them, these machines, he loved them so. The gang used him to guard their bikes when they went into a caff, or a pub. They gave him food, and even a little money sometimes. One night the rival gang found him standing over half a dozen machines, beat him up, twelve to one, and left him bleeding. His own gang returned to find a couple of their machines gone, and were ready to beat him up again but found this apparently slow stupid oaf transformed into a whirling screaming fighting madman. He nearly killed one of them. Setting on him all together they subdued him, no bones broken, but again, he was bleeding and sick. He was taken into a pub by a girl who worked there. She washed him down, sat him in a corner, gave him something to eat, talked him into sense again. He was quiet at last, dazed perhaps. </p> <p> A man came to him, sat down, and asked if he was looking for work. This was how Ben found himself on the farm. He went with Matthew Grindly because he knew that from now on any member of the two gangs seeing him would summon his mates, and he would be beaten up again. </p> <p> The farm was well away from any main road, down an over- grown and muddy lane. It was neglected, and so was the house, which was large, and bits of it were shut off where the roof leaked too badly. This farm had been left twenty years before by their father to Mary Grindly, Matthew Grindly, and Ted Grindly. A farm, but no money. They were pretty well self-sufficient, living off their animals, fruit trees, the vegetable garden. What fields there were - one after another they had been sold off to neigh- bouring farmers - grew fodder. Once a month, Mary and Matthew - now Mary and Ben - walked into the village three miles off to buy groceries, and liquor for Ted. They walked because their car was rusting in a yard. </p> <p> When money was needed for food, electricity, rates, Mary said to Matthew, 'Take that beast to market and get what you can for it.' But bills were ignored for months at a time, and often not paid at all. </p> <p> This disgraceful place tended to be forgotten by everyone: the locals were part ashamed because of it, and part sorry for the Grindlys. It was known that 'the boys' - but they were getting old now - were not far off feeble-minded. They were illiterate, too. Mary had expected to marry, but it had come to nothing. It was she who ran the farm. She told her brothers what to do: mend that fence... clean out that byre... take the sheep for shearing... plant the vegetables. She was at them all day and bitter because she had to be. Then it was Matthew who was doing all the work: Ted was drinking himself to death quietly in his room. He was no trouble, but he couldn't work. Matthew was getting arthritic, and he had chest problems, and soon the hard work was beyond him too. He fed the chickens and looked after the vegetables, but that was about it. </p> <p> Ben was given a room, with poor furniture in it - very different from the pleasant rooms he had been brought up in. He could eat as much as he wanted. He worked from daylight to dark, every day. He did know that he did most of the work, but not that without him the farm would collapse. This farm, or anything like it, would soon become impossible, when the European Com- mission issued its diktats, and its spy-eyes circled for ever overhead. The place was a scandal, and a waste of good land. People came tramping along the lane and through the farmyard, hoping to buy it - the telephone had been cut off, for non-payment - and they would be met by Mary, an angry old woman, who told them to go away, and slammed the door in their face. </p> <p> When on the neighbouring farms they were asked about the Grindlys, people tended to equivocate, siding with them against officialdom and the curious. If they lost the farm, what would happen to those poor derelicts, Ted and Matthew? They would find themselves in a Home, that's what. And Mary? No, let the poor things live out their time. And they had that chap there who'd come from somewhere, no one knew where, a kind of yeti he looked like, but he did the work well enough. </p> <p> Once, when Ben had gone with Mary to the village to carry groceries back, he was stopped by a man who said to him, 'You're with the Grindlys, they say. Are they doing right by you?' </p> <p> 'What do you want?' asked Ben. </p> <p> 'What are they paying you? Not much if I know the Grindlys. I'll make it worth your while to come to me. I'm Tom Wandsworth...' - he repeated the name, and then again, '...and anyone around here will tell you how to get to my farm. Think about it.' </p> <p> 'What did he say?' Mary asked, and Ben told her. </p> <p> Ben had never been given a pay-book, and terms and conditions of work had not been mentioned. Mary had given him a couple of quid when they went to the village so he could buy toothpaste, that kind of thing. She was impressed that he cared about his personal cleanliness, and liked his clothes neat. </p> <p> Now she said, 'I'm keeping your wages for you, Ben. You know that.' </p> <p> How could he know? This was the first time he had heard about it. Mary believed that he was stupid, like her brothers, but now saw trouble loom. </p> <p> 'You don't want to leave us, Ben,' she said. 'You'd not do better with anyone else. I've got a good little bit of money put aside for you. You can have it any time.' </p> <p> She pointed to a high-up drawer in her room. Then she fetched a chair, made him stand on it, and held the back steady. There were rolls of notes in the drawer. To Ben it seemed more money than he had imagined possible. 'Is that mine?' he asked. </p> <p> 'Half of it is yours,' said Mary. </p> <p> And when he had gone out of the room, she hid it somewhere else. </p> <p> It was Mary he did not want to leave, though he was fond of the cow and enjoyed the antics of the pigs. He thought Mary was good to him. She mended his clothes, bought him a new thick jersey for the winter, and gave him plenty of meat to eat. She was never cross with him, as she was with her brothers. </p> <p> He had a life the others did not guess at. They all went to bed early, with nothing to occupy their minds, and no television: Ted was usually drunk and snoring by nine or ten, and Mary listened to the news on the radio, and went to her room afterwards. Ben slid out over the sill of his window when the house was quiet, and went about the fields and woods, alone and free - himself. He would catch and eat little animals, or a bird. He crouched behind a bush for hours to watch fox cubs playing. He sat with his back against a tree trunk and listened to the owls. Or he stood by the cow with his arm around her neck, nuzzling his face into her; and the warmth that came into him from her, and the hot sweet blasts of her breath on his arms and legs when she turned her head to sniff at him meant the safety of kindness. Or he stood leaning on a fence post staring up at the night sky, and on clear nights he sang a little grunting song to the stars, or he danced around, lifting his feet and stamping. Once old Mary thought she heard a noise that needed investigation, went to a window, and caught a glimpse of Ben, and crept down in the dark to watch and listen. It really did make her scalp prickle and her flesh go cold. But why should she care what he did for fun? Without him the animals would be unfed, the cows would stay unmilked, the pigs would have to live in their dirt. Mary Grindly was curious about Ben, but not much. She had had too much trouble in her life to care about other people. Ben's coming to the farm she saw as God's kindness to her. </p> <p> Then Ted fell down some steps when drunk, and died. Surely Matthew should have been next, the half-crippled coughing man, but it was Mary who had a heart attack. Officials of all kinds suddenly became curious, and one of them, demanding to see accounts, asked Ben questions about himself. Ben was going to say something about the money owed to him, but his instincts shouted at him, Danger - and he ran away. </p> <p> He picked apples on a cider farm, and then he picked rasp- berries. The other pickers were Poles, mostly students, flown in by a contractor of labour, jolly young people determined to have a good time in spite of the long hours they had to work. Ben was silent and watchful, on his guard.

      "bodyText": "It was early evening and she did what she would have done alone: she brought out cans of beer from her fridge, filled her glass, and then she filled one for him. They were going to spend the evening doing what he liked best, watching television. First she found a piece of paper and wrote on it: Mrs Ellen Biggs 11 Mimosa House Halley Street, London SE6. She said, 'Ask your mother for your birth certificate. If she has to send for it, then tell her she can always write to you care of me - and here is the address.' He did not answer: he was frowning. 'Do you understand, Ben?' 'Yes.' She did not know whether he did or not, but thought so. He was looking at the television. She got up, switched it on, and came back by way of the cat. 'There, there puss, it's all right.' But the cat never for one moment took its eyes off Ben. And now it was an easy pleasant evening. He did not seem to mind what he saw. Sometimes she switched to another channel, thinking he was bored. He did like wildlife programmes, but there wasn't one tonight. This was a good thing, really, because he sometimes got too excited: she knew wild instincts had been aroused. She had understood from the start that he was controlling instincts she could only guess at. Poor Ben - she knew he was that, but not how, or why. At bedtime she unrolled on to the floor the futon he slept on, and put blankets beside it in case: he usually did not use coverings. The cat, seeing that this enemy was on the floor, leaped up on to the bed and lay close against the old woman's side. From there she could not watch Ben, but it was all right, she felt safe. When the lights were off the room was not really dark, because there was a moon that night. The old woman listened for Ben's breathing to change into what she called his night breathing. It was, she thought, like listening to a story, events or adventures that possibly the cat would understand. In his sleep Ben ran from enemies, hunted, fought. She knew he was not human: 'not one of us' as she put it. Perhaps he was a kind of yeti. When she had seen him first, in a supermarket, he was prowling - there was only that word for it - as he reached out to grab up loaves of bread. She had had a glimpse of him then, the wild man, and she had never forgotten it. He was a controlled explosion of furious needs, hungers and frustrations, and she knew that even as she said to the attendant, 'It's all right, he is with me.' She handed him a pie she had just bought for her lunch, and he was eating it as she led him out of the place. She took him home, and fed him. She washed him, though he had protested that first time. She saw how he reacted to some cold meat - quite alarming it was; but she bought extra meat for him. It was just here where he was most different; meat, he could not get enough. And she was an old woman, eating a little bit of this here, a snack there - an apple, cheese, cake, a sandwich. The stew that day had been just luck: she ate that kind of meal so seldom. One night, when the three of them had gone to bed, and to sleep, she had woken because of a pressure along her legs. Ben had crept up and laid himself down, his head near her feet, his legs bent. It was the cat's distress that had woken her. But Ben was asleep. It was how a dog lays itself down, close, for company, and her heart ached, knowing his loneliness. In the morning he woke embarrassed. He seemed to think he had done wrong, but she said, 'It's all right, Ben. There's plenty of room.' It was a big bed, the one she had had when she was married. She thought that he was like an intelligent dog, always trying to anticipate wants and commands. Not like a cat at all: that was a different kind of sensitivity. And he was not like a monkey, for he was slow and heavy. Not like anything she had known. He was Ben, he was himself - whatever that was. She was pleased he was going to find his family. He was hardly communicative, but she had gathered it was a well-off family. And there was his accent which was not what you'd expect, from how he looked. He seemed to like his mother. If she herself could be good to Ben - so Ellen Biggs saw it - then his family could too. But if it didn't work, and he turned up here again, then she would go with him to the Public Records Office and find out about his age. She was so confused about this she had given up trying to puzzle it out. He repeated that he was eighteen, and she had to believe him. In many ways he was childish, and yet when she took a good look at that face she could even think him middle-aged, with those lines around his eyes. Little ones, but still: no eighteen-year- old could have them. She had actually gone so far in her thoughts to wonder if the people he belonged to, whoever they were, matured early, in which case they would die young, according to our ideas. Middle-aged at twenty, and old at forty, whereas she, Ellen Biggs, was eighty and only just beginning to feel her age to the point that she hoped she would not have to make that annoying journey to the Records Office, and then stand in a line: the thought made her tired and cross. She fell asleep, listen- ing to Ben dream, and woke to find him gone. The paper with her address had gone, and the ten-pound note she had left for him. Although she had expected it, now she had to sit down, her hand pressing on a troubled heart. Since he had come into her life, weeks ago, foreboding had come too. Sitting alone when he had gone off somewhere she was thinking, Where's Ben? What is he doing? Was he being cheated again? Far too often had she heard from him, 'They took my money,' - 'They stole everything.' The trouble was, information came out of him in a jumble. 'When was that, Ben?' 'It was summer.' 'No, I mean, what year?' 'I don't know. It was after the farm.' 'And when was that?' 'I was there two winters.' She knew he was about fourteen when he left his family. So what had he been doing for four years? His mother had been wrong, thinking he had gone right away. He and his gang of truants from school were camping in an empty house on the edge of their town, and from there made forays, shoplifting, breaking into shops at night, and at weekends went to nearby towns to hang about the streets with the local youths, hoping for a fight and some fun. Ben was their leader because he was so strong, and stood up for them. So they thought, but really the reason was that inwardly he was mature, he was a grown man, more of a parent, whereas they were still children. One by one they were caught, sent to borstal, or returned to parents and school. One evening he was standing on the edge of a crowd of fighting youngsters - he did not fight, he was afraid of his strength, his rage - and he realised he was alone, without companions. For a while he was one of a gang of much older youths, but he did not dominate them as he had the young ones. They forced him to steal for them, made fun of him, jeered at his posh accent. He left them and drifted down to the West Country where he fell in with a motorbike gang, which was engaged in warfare with a rival gang. He longed to drive a motorcyde, but could not get the hang of it. But it was enough to be near them, these machines, he loved them so. The gang used him to guard their bikes when they went into a caff, or a pub. They gave him food, and even a little money sometimes. One night the rival gang found him standing over half a dozen machines, beat him up, twelve to one, and left him bleeding. His own gang returned to find a couple of their machines gone, and were ready to beat him up again but found this apparently slow stupid oaf transformed into a whirling screaming fighting madman. He nearly killed one of them. Setting on him all together they subdued him, no bones broken, but again, he was bleeding and sick. He was taken into a pub by a girl who worked there. She washed him down, sat him in a corner, gave him something to eat, talked him into sense again. He was quiet at last, dazed perhaps. A man came to him, sat down, and asked if he was looking for work. This was how Ben found himself on the farm. He went with Matthew Grindly because he knew that from now on any member of the two gangs seeing him would summon his mates, and he would be beaten up again. The farm was well away from any main road, down an over- grown and muddy lane. It was neglected, and so was the house, which was large, and bits of it were shut off where the roof leaked too badly. This farm had been left twenty years before by their father to Mary Grindly, Matthew Grindly, and Ted Grindly. A farm, but no money. They were pretty well self-sufficient, living off their animals, fruit trees, the vegetable garden. What fields there were - one after another they had been sold off to neigh- bouring farmers - grew fodder. Once a month, Mary and Matthew - now Mary and Ben - walked into the village three miles off to buy groceries, and liquor for Ted. They walked because their car was rusting in a yard. When money was needed for food, electricity, rates, Mary said to Matthew, 'Take that beast to market and get what you can for it.' But bills were ignored for months at a time, and often not paid at all. This disgraceful place tended to be forgotten by everyone: the locals were part ashamed because of it, and part sorry for the Grindlys. It was known that 'the boys' - but they were getting old now - were not far off feeble-minded. They were illiterate, too. Mary had expected to marry, but it had come to nothing. It was she who ran the farm. She told her brothers what to do: mend that fence... clean out that byre... take the sheep for shearing... plant the vegetables. She was at them all day and bitter because she had to be. Then it was Matthew who was doing all the work: Ted was drinking himself to death quietly in his room. He was no trouble, but he couldn't work. Matthew was getting arthritic, and he had chest problems, and soon the hard work was beyond him too. He fed the chickens and looked after the vegetables, but that was about it. Ben was given a room, with poor furniture in it - very different from the pleasant rooms he had been brought up in. He could eat as much as he wanted. He worked from daylight to dark, every day. He did know that he did most of the work, but not that without him the farm would collapse. This farm, or anything like it, would soon become impossible, when the European Com- mission issued its diktats, and its spy-eyes circled for ever overhead. The place was a scandal, and a waste of good land. People came tramping along the lane and through the farmyard, hoping to buy it - the telephone had been cut off, for non-payment - and they would be met by Mary, an angry old woman, who told them to go away, and slammed the door in their face. When on the neighbouring farms they were asked about the Grindlys, people tended to equivocate, siding with them against officialdom and the curious. If they lost the farm, what would happen to those poor derelicts, Ted and Matthew? They would find themselves in a Home, that's what. And Mary? No, let the poor things live out their time. And they had that chap there who'd come from somewhere, no one knew where, a kind of yeti he looked like, but he did the work well enough. Once, when Ben had gone with Mary to the village to carry groceries back, he was stopped by a man who said to him, 'You're with the Grindlys, they say. Are they doing right by you?' 'What do you want?' asked Ben. 'What are they paying you? Not much if I know the Grindlys. I'll make it worth your while to come to me. I'm Tom Wandsworth...' - he repeated the name, and then again, '...and anyone around here will tell you how to get to my farm. Think about it.' 'What did he say?' Mary asked, and Ben told her. Ben had never been given a pay-book, and terms and conditions of work had not been mentioned. Mary had given him a couple of quid when they went to the village so he could buy toothpaste, that kind of thing. She was impressed that he cared about his personal cleanliness, and liked his clothes neat. Now she said, 'I'm keeping your wages for you, Ben. You know that.' How could he know? This was the first time he had heard about it. Mary believed that he was stupid, like her brothers, but now saw trouble loom. 'You don't want to leave us, Ben,' she said. 'You'd not do better with anyone else. I've got a good little bit of money put aside for you. You can have it any time.' She pointed to a high-up drawer in her room. Then she fetched a chair, made him stand on it, and held the back steady. There were rolls of notes in the drawer. To Ben it seemed more money than he had imagined possible. 'Is that mine?' he asked. 'Half of it is yours,' said Mary. And when he had gone out of the room, she hid it somewhere else. It was Mary he did not want to leave, though he was fond of the cow and enjoyed the antics of the pigs. He thought Mary was good to him. She mended his clothes, bought him a new thick jersey for the winter, and gave him plenty of meat to eat. She was never cross with him, as she was with her brothers. He had a life the others did not guess at. They all went to bed early, with nothing to occupy their minds, and no television: Ted was usually drunk and snoring by nine or ten, and Mary listened to the news on the radio, and went to her room afterwards. Ben slid out over the sill of his window when the house was quiet, and went about the fields and woods, alone and free - himself. He would catch and eat little animals, or a bird. He crouched behind a bush for hours to watch fox cubs playing. He sat with his back against a tree trunk and listened to the owls. Or he stood by the cow with his arm around her neck, nuzzling his face into her; and the warmth that came into him from her, and the hot sweet blasts of her breath on his arms and legs when she turned her head to sniff at him meant the safety of kindness. Or he stood leaning on a fence post staring up at the night sky, and on clear nights he sang a little grunting song to the stars, or he danced around, lifting his feet and stamping. Once old Mary thought she heard a noise that needed investigation, went to a window, and caught a glimpse of Ben, and crept down in the dark to watch and listen. It really did make her scalp prickle and her flesh go cold. But why should she care what he did for fun? Without him the animals would be unfed, the cows would stay unmilked, the pigs would have to live in their dirt. Mary Grindly was curious about Ben, but not much. She had had too much trouble in her life to care about other people. Ben's coming to the farm she saw as God's kindness to her. Then Ted fell down some steps when drunk, and died. Surely Matthew should have been next, the half-crippled coughing man, but it was Mary who had a heart attack. Officials of all kinds suddenly became curious, and one of them, demanding to see accounts, asked Ben questions about himself. Ben was going to say something about the money owed to him, but his instincts shouted at him, Danger - and he ran away. He picked apples on a cider farm, and then he picked rasp- berries. The other pickers were Poles, mostly students, flown in by a contractor of labour, jolly young people determined to have a good time in spite of the long hours they had to work. Ben was silent and watchful, on his guard. There were caravans to sleep in, but he hated that closeness, and the bad air, and when he had finished eating with them, at night, listening to their songs and their jokes and their laughter, he took a sleeping bag into a wood. When the picking was finished he had a good bit of money, and he was happy, because he knew that it was having no money that made him helpless. One of the singing and joking young people stole his money from his jacket that was hanging above him on a bush where he lay asleep. Ben made himself go back to the farm, thinking of all that money in the drawer, and half of it belonging to him, but the house was locked, the animals were gone, and there were already nettles growing close up around the house. He did not care about Matthew, who had scarcely spoken to him except for unkind remarks such as when the old dog died - 'We don't need another dog, we've got Ben.' He went home to find his mother but she had moved again. He had to use his wits to find where she was. A house, but nothing like the one he thought of as home. He could not make himself go in, because he saw Paul there, and the rage that was his enemy nearly overcame him. So he took the old, old road to London, rich London, where surely there must be a little something for him too. There he did find work, was cheated again, lost heart, and Ellen Briggs found him starving in a supermarket.",

      "bodyText": "Nearly half a century ago, in a Europe awash with its own dispossessed, the civilised nations of the world adopted the United Nations Convention on Refugees. It offered the millions of (white) Europeans displaced by the second world war and dramatic boundary changes the chance of safety and dignity in a new country. Now Jack Straw wants to rewrite the convention, chopping out the bits offering refugees the automatic right to be considered for asylum once they have reached safety. Responding to the tabloid clamour for action against \"bogus\" asylum seekers from the Balkans and beyond, the home secretary is saying to a European Union conference in Lisbon that the 1951 UN Convention is outdated and no longer meets the needs of refugees or host countries. He argues that there is an \"inherent contradiction\" in the requirement that signatory countries must consider all asylum applications by refugees within their jurisdiction, even those who have entered illegally. Instead, he is proposing that would-be asylum seekers should be able to apply from \"safe\" third countries, and that host nations should agree a quota system to share out refugees among them. The present system, he believes, encourages refugees to seek help from criminals to smuggle them over international frontiers. Mr Straw's proposal is under fire by humanitarian groups. Alisdair Mackenzie, coordinator of Asylum Aid, said it was \"fundamentally flawed and seems designed to keep out refugees rather than ensure that victims of persecution receive protection\". Amnesty International director Kate Allen said that the \"safe country\" idea could leave some of the world's poorest countries picking up the tab for refugees fleeing persecution in neighbouring states. \"Jack Straw wants to turn the refugee convention on its head by making it a charter for governments to bar asylum seekers, rather than for asylum seekers to seek refuge,\" she said. The home secretary is making much of the disproportionate share of asylum seekers entering Britain, compared with other EU countries. In fact, numbers of applications in the UK have dropped sharply in recent months, according to the latest figures from the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees. Indeed, the sad fact remains that the vast majority of the world's six million or so officially classified refugees are exactly where Mr Straw wants them - in \"safe\" third countries.

The foreign secretary's <a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/news/speechtext.asp?3806 \" target=\"_new\">speech</a>, delivered hours earlier in the Commons, did not dispute this. But journalists noticed that four short passages praising the single currency - included in the draft speech handed to journalists - were not used by Robin Cook.

Neither the chancellor nor the foreign secretary think Britain should join the single currency immediately, and neither of them wants to rule it out all altogether. Both seem to think it sensible for the government to plan a referendum on membership at some point after the next election. Gordon Brown sets great store by the five 'tests' he has devised to determine whether the time is right to join. He explained them in detail last night. As well as many economists, Robin Cook may think these tests somewhat subjective. Unlike them, he has not said so - in public, at least. </p> <p><b> So they really agree? </b> <br> Not quite. Robin Cook and Gordon Brown might agree about the broad sweep of policy towards the euro, but they certainly disagree when it come to the matter of tone. The chancellor's early enthusiasm for the single currency, in 1997 and 1998, has been replaced by a cautious neutrality. Some people close to him think he has become an enthusiast for the American economic model. In contrast, the foreign secretary - always a pro-European - has become openly keen on joining the single currency. His draft speech, for instance, included a promise that the government 'would not let Britain lose by staying out' - words that the chancellor would be unlikely to use. </p> <p><b> Is the government split on the issue then?</b> <br> To a degree. Apart from the foreign secretary, two other leading ministers; the trade secretary, Stephen Byers, and the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, would like the government to be more openly enthusiastic about the euro. But the real issue is not a fundamental split between pro-Europeans and anti-Europeans, but a concern on the part of pro-Europeans that the single currency is not an issue on which the government should remain neutral. They think that without a clear lead from the prime minister and the chancellor, public opinion will never swing in favour of the single currency. </p> <p><b> What about Tony Blair? </b> <br> The prime minister's main concern is to maintain a united front. The last thing he wants is a public split between his chancellor and his foreign secretary as the election approaches. That's why it looks like Downing Street could have been behind Robin Cook's decision not to use the most pro-euro lines in his speech (although the foreign secretary says it was a spur-of-the-moment decision he made while speaking). Privately, Tony Blair seems keener on the euro than Gordon Brown, but he wants, at all costs, to avoid the single currency becoming an election issue.

The Queen ordered an RPS bodyguard to be sent to Switzerland to watch over Princess Beatrice, the Duchess of York's daughter, who is being educated at a boarding school in the Alps.

I'd like to commemorate some deserving Chichester women, like nurses, or outstanding mothers who have brought up their children against all the odds.\" Eleven new streets are due to be named in the near future and Councillor Pingree has launched an appeal for people to come forward with the names of women who have played an important role in the life of the community. \"I used to know a fabulous girl from up Fishbourne way,\" recalled one local man. \"We used to call her Martha Melons, although I somehow suspect that's not the sort of name they're looking for.\" This is Mid-Sussex Letter of the week \"Sir, police recently prosecuted a man for eating a Kit-Kat whilst driving and they charged a young lady for drinking water whilst at red traffic lights. But here's a better one which they missed. The time: approximately 9.45am last Friday. The place: well, lets just say somewhere between Heaton and Nab Wood. As I drove along the road I saw a car in the distance, on the opposite side of the road, with hazard warning lights flashing. He must have a problem, I thought. But no! As I got nearer I saw that he was driving with one hand whilst holding a surveyor's measuring wheel on the road with the other. What a pity I didn't have my camcorder with me. It would have been a sure winner for You've Been Framed!\". Peter Rushforth, Bradford Telegraph and Argus",

The Academy's announcement underlines the rule that \"films which receive their first public exhibition or distribution in any manner other than as a theatrical motion picture release will not be eligible for Academy Awards in any category.\" The bylaws will now read, \"This includes broadcast and cable television, as well as home video marketing and internet transmission.\" Academy executive director Bruce Davis told Variety: \"The board just wants to make it crystal clear, so that in the rush to embrace new technologies, a legitimate theatrical motion picture doesn't inadvertently jeopardise its eligibility.\" In another change for next year's 73rd annual Oscar awards, foreign-language films that are submitted, but not nominated one year, will now be eligible the following year in other categories. John Pavlik, the Academy's director of communications, explained that Run Lola Run had prompted that particular change in the rules. \"The film was submitted by Germany for the 71st Academy Awards, yet it had not yet opened in LA. It was released here in 1999 and was not able to resubmit.\" But many thought the frenetic crime drama could have been a contender in several Oscar categories. \"Under these new rules, the committee is giving excellent films as many chances as they can,\" said Pavlik.",

      "body": "<p>Forget about getting a life; these days, it's all about shopping for a lifestyle. From the clothes you wear to the magazines you read to the CDs you buy, your possessions speak volumes about who you are. Designers such as Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein and Versace have been quick to cash in on the trend for head-to-toe designer living, offering paint, homeware and furniture respectively. Gone are the days of feathering your nest with any old tat. </p> <p>On Manhattan's Madison Avenue, DKNY's flagship store opened nine months ago, directly opposite the department store Barney's - the old style of shopping confronted by the new. DKNY's enormous window displays promise a life based on the American dream: mannequins in brightly coloured linen outfits lounge decorously on painted beach furniture, piles of art books scattered at their plastic feet. </p> <p>Inside is a glimpse of a way of life designed entirely by sleek Manhattanite Donna Karan: sunglasses, watches, crockery and candles are laid out in little vignettes, all colour-coordinated to match the nearest rack of clothes. These are interspersed with art installations, an eclectic selection of CDs (Kid Loco, Ben and Jason, Sneaker Pimps) and trendy magazines (i.D., Interview, Out). For decoration, beach chairs, bonsai trees and vases of oversized flowers are placed carefully around the store's three levels. You can even pick up a DKNY surfboard or a DKNY motorcycle. And that's not to mention the overflowing rails of DKNY clothes. </p> <p>According to Anjali Lewis, vice president of marketing and communications at DKNY: \"This is a complete lifestyle environment. Donna Karan is not just about clothing, it's about your whole life. We've learned that the consumer really wants to walk in and not just pick up a pair of jeans, but be able to shop for books, buy flowers, have a juice, meet friends.\" </p> <p>Although the store stocks mainly DKNY products, there are also accessories by lesser-known designers and vintage dresses selected by \"the lifestyle buying department\". \"Donna loves all things well-designed, so we look for great products that marry well with our philosophy.\" Which is? \"Basic, beautifully designed products that Donna craves.\" </p> <p>It is only within the past five years that lifestyle stores have taken off, following the rise of the so-called lifestyle magazines. As well as DKNY in New York, there is Corso Como in Milan and, most famously, Colette in Paris. \"It was a time when lots of people were complaining that Paris was dead and moving to New York or London,\" recalls Sarah (\"We never say our last names\"), daughter of the eponymous Colette. \"My mother and I knew we wanted something new for our city, to provide products and designs you couldn't get here. Now it has become part of a new generation of fashion that has rescued Paris.\" </p> <p>Colette opened in March 1997 \"and it just took off right away\". Its concept is to stock the best products and designer names from around the world: the coffee served in the cafe is from Harvey Nichols, there is a mini Bumble and Bumble hair salon, the restaurant has multinational dishes. \"It is a way of mixing products from various collections, mixing fashion with music with food with design,\" Sarah explains. \"It is a place appealing to all kinds of customers.\" </p> <p>The result is like a museum devoted to how the beautiful people live in the 21st century. Chloe sunglasses, Prada kitten heels, Michael Kors cashmere jumpers, Anya Hindmarch wallets, Michel Perry shoes and international magazines such as sleazenation and Nylon are laid out in glass cases, while dummies are decked out in Jeremy Scott. The layout, like that of DKNY, makes even a simple candlestick seem like an object of desire. Ultimately, both have the same aim: to provide the diversity of a department store but with more unusual products and in a more appealing, intimate environment. </p> <p>While Paris, New York and Milan have long had successful lifestyle boutiques, leading to the logical conclusion of the larger lifestyle store, similar boutiques have only recently arrived in London. Joseph and Brown's have been selling an eclectic range of clothes since the 70s (\"Joseph's Sloane Street cafe opened in 1984, a long time before Colette,\" Sidonie Schoeff, spokesperson for Joseph, points out), but in the past three years there has been a blossoming of these tiny boutiques around the capital. s and m on Primrose Hill sells all things cutting edge, from Hysteric Glamour T-shirts to David Bailey photographs; The Cross in W11 is well-loved for its eclectic labels and accessories; at The Pineal Eye in Soho, you can pick up Japanese gadgetry or deconstructed Belgian clothing, as you can at Kokon To Zai, around the corner. </p> <p> But size is not the only aspect that differentiates Britain's boutiques from the lifestyle stores overseas. While Colette stocks designers such as Prada and Marc Jacobs, a customer at Mimi on Chelsea's King's Road, for example, will find smaller labels such as Boyd and Paul and Joe. (All still, however, at forbiddingly exclusive prices: the discerning shopper could easily spend \u00a3650 in any of these shops and walk out with only three items.) </p> <p>\"Parisians are more chic, more label-focused,\" says Philine Dumba, PR spokesperson for Brown's. \"Londoners like more unusual clothing. At boutiques you can find more one-offs. We often buy only one or two pieces from a new designer. The buyers for boutiques know exactly what the customers want, making it an easier way to shop,\" she adds. \"Department stores are such a headache, going up and down those escalators.\" </p> <p>With the growing popularity of these boutiques, and the success of their overseas predecessors, a lifestyle store in London on the scale of those in New York and Paris seems inevitable, even necessary, if London is to maintain its reputation as a fashion capital. Indeed, there is already the similarly conceived Urban Outfitters on Kensington High Street and the large DKNY store on Bond Street, \"which will shortly become more lifestyle oriented,\" Lewis promises. Unquestionably, these stores were created in response to the decline of the department store and, more importantly, the rise of shopping on the internet. Somehow, retailers had to entice people away from their computers and they are doing it by offering variety, a social centre and the suggestion that the customer is not merely shopping but buying into a desirable lifestyle. </p> <p>\"Whether you go in and buy a lot or go in and hang out all day, we've moved you somehow and that's the aim - to touch you emotionally,\" Lewis says. At last, the old It Girl maxim has become a reality: shopping really is life.</p>",

DKNY's enormous window displays promise a life based on the American dream: mannequins in brightly coloured linen outfits lounge decorously on painted beach furniture, piles of art books scattered at their plastic feet. Inside is a glimpse of a way of life designed entirely by sleek Manhattanite Donna Karan: sunglasses, watches, crockery and candles are laid out in little vignettes, all colour-coordinated to match the nearest rack of clothes. These are interspersed with art installations, an eclectic selection of CDs (Kid Loco, Ben and Jason, Sneaker Pimps) and trendy magazines (i.D., Interview, Out). For decoration, beach chairs, bonsai trees and vases of oversized flowers are placed carefully around the store's three levels. You can even pick up a DKNY surfboard or a DKNY motorcycle. And that's not to mention the overflowing rails of DKNY clothes. According to Anjali Lewis, vice president of marketing and communications at DKNY: \"This is a complete lifestyle environment. Donna Karan is not just about clothing, it's about your whole life. We've learned that the consumer really wants to walk in and not just pick up a pair of jeans, but be able to shop for books, buy flowers, have a juice, meet friends.\" Although the store stocks mainly DKNY products, there are also accessories by lesser-known designers and vintage dresses selected by \"the lifestyle buying department\". \"Donna loves all things well-designed, so we look for great products that marry well with our philosophy.\" Which is? \"Basic, beautifully designed products that Donna craves.\" It is only within the past five years that lifestyle stores have taken off, following the rise of the so-called lifestyle magazines. As well as DKNY in New York, there is Corso Como in Milan and, most famously, Colette in Paris. \"It was a time when lots of people were complaining that Paris was dead and moving to New York or London,\" recalls Sarah (\"We never say our last names\"), daughter of the eponymous Colette. \"My mother and I knew we wanted something new for our city, to provide products and designs you couldn't get here. Now it has become part of a new generation of fashion that has rescued Paris.\" Colette opened in March 1997 \"and it just took off right away\". Its concept is to stock the best products and designer names from around the world: the coffee served in the cafe is from Harvey Nichols, there is a mini Bumble and Bumble hair salon, the restaurant has multinational dishes. \"It is a way of mixing products from various collections, mixing fashion with music with food with design,\" Sarah explains. \"It is a place appealing to all kinds of customers.\" The result is like a museum devoted to how the beautiful people live in the 21st century. Chloe sunglasses, Prada kitten heels, Michael Kors cashmere jumpers, Anya Hindmarch wallets, Michel Perry shoes and international magazines such as sleazenation and Nylon are laid out in glass cases, while dummies are decked out in Jeremy Scott. The layout, like that of DKNY, makes even a simple candlestick seem like an object of desire. Ultimately, both have the same aim: to provide the diversity of a department store but with more unusual products and in a more appealing, intimate environment. While Paris, New York and Milan have long had successful lifestyle boutiques, leading to the logical conclusion of the larger lifestyle store, similar boutiques have only recently arrived in London. Joseph and Brown's have been selling an eclectic range of clothes since the 70s (\"Joseph's Sloane Street cafe opened in 1984, a long time before Colette,\" Sidonie Schoeff, spokesperson for Joseph, points out), but in the past three years there has been a blossoming of these tiny boutiques around the capital. s and m on Primrose Hill sells all things cutting edge, from Hysteric Glamour T-shirts to David Bailey photographs; The Cross in W11 is well-loved for its eclectic labels and accessories; at The Pineal Eye in Soho, you can pick up Japanese gadgetry or deconstructed Belgian clothing, as you can at Kokon To Zai, around the corner. But size is not the only aspect that differentiates Britain's boutiques from the lifestyle stores overseas. While Colette stocks designers such as Prada and Marc Jacobs, a customer at Mimi on Chelsea's King's Road, for example, will find smaller labels such as Boyd and Paul and Joe. (All still, however, at forbiddingly exclusive prices: the discerning shopper could easily spend \u00a3650 in any of these shops and walk out with only three items.) \"Parisians are more chic, more label-focused,\" says Philine Dumba, PR spokesperson for Brown's. \"Londoners like more unusual clothing. At boutiques you can find more one-offs. We often buy only one or two pieces from a new designer. The buyers for boutiques know exactly what the customers want, making it an easier way to shop,\" she adds. \"Department stores are such a headache, going up and down those escalators.\" With the growing popularity of these boutiques, and the success of their overseas predecessors, a lifestyle store in London on the scale of those in New York and Paris seems inevitable, even necessary, if London is to maintain its reputation as a fashion capital. Indeed, there is already the similarly conceived Urban Outfitters on Kensington High Street and the large DKNY store on Bond Street, \"which will shortly become more lifestyle oriented,\" Lewis promises. Unquestionably, these stores were created in response to the decline of the department store and, more importantly, the rise of shopping on the internet. Somehow, retailers had to entice people away from their computers and they are doing it by offering variety, a social centre and the suggestion that the customer is not merely shopping but buying into a desirable lifestyle. \"Whether you go in and buy a lot or go in and hang out all day, we've moved you somehow and that's the aim - to touch you emotionally,\" Lewis says. At last, the old It Girl maxim has become a reality: shopping really is life.",

      "body": "<p>Madam Speaker, </p> <p> When this Government took office we gave a commitment that we would make Britain a leading player in Europe. In the three years since then, we have taken Britain off the sidelines of Europe and made it one of the leading players in the team.</p> <p> Britain is now in the driver's seat on the big issues before the European Councils - we were in the driving seat on enlargement at Helsinki, we were on economic reform at Lisbon and we will again be on European security at Feira.</p> <p> <strong>EUROPEAN SECURITY</strong></p> <p> European security is a British initiative. The Prime Minister launched it at the Portschach Summit and we then took it forward in alliance with France and Germany. Two years later we can look back with satisfaction at how well that initiative has prospered and at the consensus within Europe we have built around what was a British idea. </p> <p> The European Union has helped to make possible half a century of unprecedented peace between its members. Integration between our economies has made unthinkable war between our countries. A common commitment to democracy and the rule of law has promoted stability and placed a barrier in the way of extremism.</p> <p> At Feira, we will agree to detailed arrangements for cooperation between Europe and NATO. In particular, we will approve the basis for participation in European crisis management by the six members of NATO who are European countries but not European Union members. They will have the right to be consulted before the European Union initiates any crisis operation, the right to participate in it, and the same rights in its management as any other participant. I met all of these six countries at Florence at the NATO meeting. They recognise that this is an excellent outcome for them and they also recognise that they would not have achieved that outcome if it had not been for the leading role that Britain played on the security agenda.</p> <p> Concern that a European Security Defence Policy might result in conflict with NATO is misplaced. Territorial defence will remain a job only for NATO, and the European Union will only launch an intervention when it as a whole is not engaged. </p> <p> Our higher standing in Europe has not only enabled us to take forward proposals in Britain's interests but they have also enabled us to see off proposals that could be damaging to Britain's interests.</p> <p> Last year, we were under pressure to agree to a withholding tax across Europe. This year, we have won the argument. There is not going to be a European withholding tax. Britain has secured majority support for our view that the better way forward is through increased transparency and exchange of information. Now it is the four member states who still resist greater transparency who are under pressure to agree to our proposals. My RHF the Chancellor deserves credit for having turned round the argument and ensured the continuing success of Britain's financial industry. </p> <p> The European Council will also confirm Greece as a member of the Euro zone. This will reduce to three the member states outside the Euro. Denmark will hold a referendum on whether it should join in September and Sweden may take the same decision in 2002. </p> <p> <strong>THE EURO</strong></p> <p>Plainly Britain can only join the euro if the conditions are right. But we will only be ready for that event if we prepare now and if, when the time comes, we decide, on the basis of economic tests.</p> <p> As my RHF the Chancellor, said in his statement to the House 'the potential benefits for Britain of a successful single currency are obvious, in terms of trade, transparency of costs and currency stability'. It is obvious because the euro zone is the market for the greater part of our exports and it is our access to Europe that is by far the largest incentive for inward investment.</p> <p> Our bottom line will be whether membership of Europe will assist in meeting our goal of full employment. </p> <p> <strong>DECLARATION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS</strong></p> <p> The Feira Council will also hear a report on work in progress to develop a declaration of fundamental rights. The report will be given by Roman Herzog, the Chair of the Convention preparing the Charter. He said:</p> <p> 'The Charter would create no new powers for the EU over its member states. It would apply only to EU institutions without imposing new rights and the Charter was not the kernel of a European constitution.'</p> <p> There is absolutely no reason why Britain, of all nations, should run scared of discussions on fundamental rights. Britain is after all one of the cradles of European freedom and liberty. Britain took the lead in the drafting of the European Convention on Human Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. </p> <p> Europe already has in the ECHR a legally binding code for members states. We want to make sure that it remains the sole legal guarantee. A separate legal text could undermine, not strengthen, the European system of human rights. That is a view shared by a number of other member states. Britain is not alone on this issue, that is why at the European Council we will together make it clear that there is no consensus for the Charter becoming a legally binding text. </p> <p> <strong>ENLARGEMENT</strong></p> <p> At Feira, we will also take stock of progress on enlargement. The Portuguese Presidency has maintained steady progress on enlargement. Negotiations have been launched with six more candidates, and the original six candidates are advanced in the negotiation on almost all chapters of the European legislation. </p> <p> For Central and Eastern Europe enlargement will provide assurance of political security and economic opportunity. For the European Union, it will provide a membership of 500 million people - a market twice the size of the United States and four times the size of Japan. It will give Europe, and Britain, extra leverage in international trade negotiations. </p> <p> It is a rich prize. But if we are to grasp it, we must reform the European Union to make it ready for enlargement. That is why it is important at the forthcoming European Council that we maintain the momentum of the Intergovernmental Conference on Enlargement and keep it on schedule for completion by the end of the year. </p> <p> Our key objective is to get a reweighting of votes in the Council of Ministers to give Britain a bigger vote. We want to keep the fixed ceiling on the European Parliament so that it does not balloon with enlargement. </p> <p> We want to control the size of the Commission so that it does not become a mass meeting rather than a functioning college. </p> <p> We will agree to majority voting only where it would remove obstacles to reforms that Britain wants. </p> <p> So there is not going to be anything in the Treaty of Nice that represents a threat to Britain or the British way of life. And there is going to be much in the Treaty of Nice of immense value to the candidate countries. They know that enlargement will only be agreed if these reforms are first agreed. Nothing could do more to lose Britain friends from the Baltic to the Balkans than to block the reforms to prepare Europe for enlargement. </p> <p> All the applicant countries want to be full members of the European Union. They want to be accepted as equal members. That is why there has been unease among them at the recent speech by Joschka Fischer with its implication of a vanguard of member states providing an inner core of the European Union. What I thought was revealing about the aftermath to the Fischer speech was the degree of resistance to it across Europe. I would not go so far as the Foreign Minister of Finland who described it as Leninist, but I share the fears expressed by the Swedish Foreign Minister about any federal structure that has the effect of 'dividing the EU into a core of nations and other countries with lesser status'. </p> <p> Even in France the reaction has been, to put it politely, reserved. Hubert Vedrine set out last Friday a series of searching and intelligent questions about the problem of attempting to define an inner and outer core, and the difficulties of a Federation co-existing with strong nation states. </p> <p> The reality now is that the broader consensus does not seek a federal superstate but a union of free and democratic member states. As Chancellor Schroeder has said 'the nation state will be the centre of people's hopes and needs.' Or as President Chirac has put it 'Europe's, future is not a United States of Europe but a United Europe of States.' </p> <p><strong>REFORM AGENDA</strong></p> <p> We have been able to get reform in Europe because our partners believe we want reforms that will make Europe work better. </p> <p> That is why we have been able to make the running on economic reform at Lisbon. We secured a programme to put Europe at the front of the revolution in communications. </p> <p> We are setting the targets for reform of the Commission. Indeed we have been so successful in setting the benchmarks for reform of the Commission that in Brussels there are complaints that they are being compelled to accept an Anglo-Saxon model. </p> <p> We can now go to Portugal knowing that issues such as European Security are top of the agenda because Britain put them there. And confident that we can get a good deal out of the Inter-Governmental Conference because we have allies and partners. </p> <p> That is good for Britain. Good for the three million households whose income depends on our exports to Europe. Good for Britain's wider standing around the world. And a good demonstration that the British people are best served by Britain being not semi-detached from Europe, but by being a whole-hearted member of a successful European Union. </p>",

In his annual speech to the City, he warned cabinet ministers pressing to step up campaigning on the euro that he would not \"fudge\" the government's five economic tests for membership. His comments were outwardly aimed at the Conservatives who have accused Labour of wanting to take Britain into the single currency \"by stealth\". But they were being widely seen as a rebuff to senior ministers like Mr Cook and Stephen Byers who have been pressing for the government to be more positive towards the euro in the run-up to general election. In his 31-minute speech, Mr Brown - who again shunned tradition by attending the black tie event in a lounge suit - insisted that the government's \"prepare and decide\" policy would be implemented \"in full\". His comments, described by Treasury sources as \"unusually robust\", were viewed as an attempt by Mr Brown to reassert his primacy in shaping policy on the euro. However, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Matthew Taylor said that the chancellor had \"simply ducked\" the issues surrounding the euro. \"We all know what his five tests are - the real question is how to fulfil them.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In the war of words over the police bill the first casualty has been the truth about just how radical the changes to policing will be. The second has been detailed attention to what the government is actually proposing to implement: the Patten commission's report.</p> <p>I remain absolutely determined to implement the Patten recommendations and to achieve the effective and representative policing service - accepted in every part of Northern Ireland - that his report aimed to secure.</p> <p>The changes proposed are the most radical seen anywhere. The legislation - even before the changes which it will certainly undergo - promises a police service with stronger accountability, greater community involvement, and a stricter human-rights culture than any policing service in Great Britain or the Republic of Ireland. So what is the reality behind the \"dilutions\" myth?</p> <p><b> Name, symbols and flags: </b> Patten suggested that the name of the RUC should be changed to signal the new beginning in policing that we all desire. He also recommended that the RUC should not be disbanded and said that \"the link between the RUC and the new police service should be recognised\".</p> <p>I am being faithful to Patten on both points by suggesting that the name will indeed change - I have suggested the Police Service of Northern Ireland - while the RUC will be retained in the \"title deeds\" to show that disbandment has not taken place. I believe that most reasonable people will see this as a sensible way of reaching Patten's twin objectives.</p> <p><b> Human rights:</b> No one could deny that the bill cements hu man rights as the cornerstone of the new police service, as Patten recommended. The code of ethics - to which all officers will have to sign up - and the policing board's powers to monitor the performance of the service against human-rights standards are tough and innovative. The key point is to ensure that all officers are bound by the same standards of behaviour and the legislation will secure this.</p> <p><b> Catholic representation:</b> I am implementing Patten's 50/50 recruitment scheme, although it will mean changing the law and persuading our European partners that this is a special case of reverse discrimination. I have listened to concerns about the time limits placed on this scheme and I agree that it should be allowed to continue for as long as it takes to achieve the appropriate Catholic/Protestant balance. I also agree that it should be possible for a shortfall in one year to be made up in another.</p> <p><b> Accountability and the new policing board:</b> The accountability arrangements embodied in the new policing board already go far beyond anything in Great Britain or the Republic of Ireland. However, I acknowledge that I may have been too cautious in placing safeguards on the powers of the board, particularly in relation to the launching of inquiries.

      "bodyText": "In the war of words over the police bill the first casualty has been the truth about just how radical the changes to policing will be. The second has been detailed attention to what the government is actually proposing to implement: the Patten commission's report. I remain absolutely determined to implement the Patten recommendations and to achieve the effective and representative policing service - accepted in every part of Northern Ireland - that his report aimed to secure. The changes proposed are the most radical seen anywhere. The legislation - even before the changes which it will certainly undergo - promises a police service with stronger accountability, greater community involvement, and a stricter human-rights culture than any policing service in Great Britain or the Republic of Ireland. So what is the reality behind the \"dilutions\" myth? Name, symbols and flags: Patten suggested that the name of the RUC should be changed to signal the new beginning in policing that we all desire. He also recommended that the RUC should not be disbanded and said that \"the link between the RUC and the new police service should be recognised\". I am being faithful to Patten on both points by suggesting that the name will indeed change - I have suggested the Police Service of Northern Ireland - while the RUC will be retained in the \"title deeds\" to show that disbandment has not taken place. I believe that most reasonable people will see this as a sensible way of reaching Patten's twin objectives. Human rights: No one could deny that the bill cements hu man rights as the cornerstone of the new police service, as Patten recommended. The code of ethics - to which all officers will have to sign up - and the policing board's powers to monitor the performance of the service against human-rights standards are tough and innovative. The key point is to ensure that all officers are bound by the same standards of behaviour and the legislation will secure this. Catholic representation: I am implementing Patten's 50/50 recruitment scheme, although it will mean changing the law and persuading our European partners that this is a special case of reverse discrimination. I have listened to concerns about the time limits placed on this scheme and I agree that it should be allowed to continue for as long as it takes to achieve the appropriate Catholic/Protestant balance. I also agree that it should be possible for a shortfall in one year to be made up in another. Accountability and the new policing board: The accountability arrangements embodied in the new policing board already go far beyond anything in Great Britain or the Republic of Ireland. However, I acknowledge that I may have been too cautious in placing safeguards on the powers of the board, particularly in relation to the launching of inquiries. I wanted to avoid parties using the police as a political battleground. I maintain this concern but perhaps I was over-pessimistic. Let's hope this is borne out in reality. District policing partnerships (DPPs): I have faithfully implemented Patten's system of DPPs, although I have stressed that their consultative and advisory role must get off the ground before expenditure and service delivery duties are added. During the consultation period I heard concerns from all sections of the community that DPPs' fund-raising powers might be open to manipulation by paramilitary groups. Disqualifications: The same concerns were voiced about people convicted of terrorist offences sitting on the policing board or the DPPs. Patten himself said the community would find this hard to accept. However, the bill makes it clear that elected members of these bodies are not subject to any such restrictions. Their democratic mandate overrides other considerations. A s far as the independent members are concerned, while there may be debate about the exact safeguards for exclusion, the real issue is one of time. We all long for the day when this sensitivity recedes and terrorist convictions can be relegated in the selection procedures for these bodies. But this moment has not yet been reached. The ombudsman: The ombudsman has powers which are unique in Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland. She can initiate completely independent investigations, using her own investigators to pursue complaints against the police. I believe she will have the power to deal with any \"bad apples\" in the service. The ombudsman says she is content with her powers. I welcome the strong interest generated by this debate. The future of policing should arouse passion. But let us get past the political hysteria and concentrate instead on detail and practicality. No one who has read the bill and the government's recently published implementation plan, and listened to my assurances that I am ready to make refinements and changes, could seriously say that I have \"binned\" or \"gutted\" Patten. Our goal remains a police service which is not only a model for others but is a career choice for the very best of our young people of both traditions. That was Patten's goal and it is mine.

The man went by the name of \"John\". He offered Cronje $10,000 (\u00a36,600) to lose the game. Cronje said he believed it was the same \"John\" who had approached Australia's Shane Warne and Mark Waugh three months earlier.

A survey of 133 members of the Society of British Neurosurgeons showed that more than 70% of the surgeons said the growth of litigation had caused them to change the way they practised medicine compared with five years ago. The analysis carried out for BBC2's Newsnight found that they were less likely to treat elderly patients, those whose condition was not seen as so serious, and patients judged more likely to sue if not left \"100% normal\". Around 75% confirmed they had experienced litigation or the threat of serious litigation over the past 12 months. The survey said there were 272 cases or threats of legal action last year compared with 97 a decade ago. Ciaran Bolger, consultant neurosurgeon at Frenchay hospital, Bristol, told Newsnight: \"The atmosphere of blame and looking for someone to blame if things don't work out quite right does make people stop and think.\"",

The detention of Mr Gusinsky, the man whose television station and other media outlets have been critical of the Kremlin and ridiculed Mr Putin, had deepened doubts about the Russian leader's commitment to democracy and cast a sinister shadow over his first official foreign tour. It appeared yesterday that the Russian president had sensed belatedly the damage done. \"One certainly had other possibilities [such as] to question him without an arrest,\" he said in Berlin. \"I think it was excessive.\" Mr Putin had previously supported the decision to arrest Mr Gusinsky, but claimed that the decision had been taken independently by the Moscow prosecutor's office. His latest words found an echo back in Moscow where Valery Nikolayev, the chief investigator at the prosecutor's office, said he would consider letting Mr Gusinsky out of jail. \"After carrying out certain investigation procedures, I will consider whether we need to keep suspect Gusinsky in detention any longer,\" he told state television. He said the media mogul would be charged today. Mr Gusinsky was jailed on Tuesday on suspicion of embezzlement but, in a statement brought out of jail by his lawyer yesterday, he said he had not yet been told what charges he faced. \"This is a political intrigue organised by senior representatives of the state for whom the freedom of speech is a danger,\" the statement added.

In spite of the official caution over this week's talks, the administration aims to do almost anything in its power to contrive a big foreign policy triumph in the closing months of Mr Clinton's presidency. Last month, he managed a rare international trade success on Capitol Hill, when Congress approved the administration's China trade normalisation legislation. But that victory owed as much to Mr Clinton's Republican opponents, who provided most of the votes in favour of the measure, as it did to the president himself.

Michal Zitko, whose Prague-based publishing firm Ottaker II re-released Hitler's manifesto for the first time in the Czech Republic in over half a century has been charged with disseminating Nazi propaganda and faces eight years in prison if he is found guilty at a court hearing next week. Police have indicated that they might even pull the book from library shelves. Mr Zitko, 28, argues that he is the victim of confusion and lack of legislation to distinguish between freedom of speech and censorship. \"Just like under communism an index of forbidden books is being created,\" he said. He has also published in translation the US constitution and declaration of independence and has plans to reintroduce Karl Marx's Das Kapital to Czech bookshops. He declared himself stunned at the Mein Kampf crackdown. \"It was published as part of our Books that Changed the World project and some people have misunderstood my in tentions,\" he said. Mein Kampf is freely available in most western countries. The raids were ordered by the government after protests by Jewish and German groups. \"Freedom of speech has its limits,\" said Tomas Kraus or the Czech Federation of Jewish communities. \"A jail sentence would allow society to show its defensive reflexes.\" But defenders of free speech see the moves as a sign that strict censorship - as experienced during the four decades of communism that ended in 1990 - is on its way back.

      "bodyText": "The author of the Poldark novels yesterday said a fire at a stately home nearly destroyed his latest work. Winston Graham, 89, was staying at Prideaux Place, near Padstow, Cornwall, when a fire broke out in the rooms he was using. Around 50 visitors were evacuated. Forty firefighters rescued paintings and antiques and extinguished the fire before it took hold. The home is temporarily closed to the public. Mr Graham said that if the \"unrepeatable manuscript\" in his suitcase had gone up in smoke \"it would have, I think, killed the Poldarks\". The owner of Prideaux Place, Peter Prideaux-Brune, said that in another 10 minutes \"it would have been the end of the house. [Fire] would have got into the main rafters.\"",

Ms Page, giving evidence to the Commons culture, media and sport committee, was speaking for the first time in detail about the project since she was sacked as chief executive after the first month's disastrous attendance figures and the fiasco of the millennium eve party, when thousands of VIP guests were left queuing for hours. The committee members, renowned for their ferocity with witnesses, treated her with notable gentleness. Norman Page, Liberal Democrat spokesman on the dome, said: \"Jennie Page is just the fall guy, former dome ministers should be in the dock.\" Committee chairman Gerald Kaufman warmly thanked her for her evidence and wished her well. \"Wherever you next go, I believe you will be an asset.\" In an hour of answering questions Ms Page never raised her voice or betrayed the slightest emotion, and neither accepted nor allocated blame. However she said she had not been back to the dome since February 4, her last working day, \"because it would not be fair on our people\". Market research had shown the public very much wanted something major to mark the millennium, but did not want this to be a political project by the government. The dome had the problem from the start that the public very much associated it with successive governments, and with significant figures in those governments. She named no names, but asked if the appointment of Peter Mandelson as dome minister had increased the politicisation of the project, she replied: \"I made several attempts to persuade ministers that standing back from the dome would be good for them as well as good for the dome.\" She was closely questioned about the rosy visitor projections, the main reason why the dome is now perceived as a failure: the official prediction, before opening, was 12m, and this was later reduced to 7m. Ms Page outlined the projections of visitor figures, and insisted they were justified by market research. As recently as last October, research showed 17m people were strongly minded to visit the dome. However by then the dome management knew it would have a cash flow problem because advance ticket sales were so slow, and this was made worse on opening by the thousands of school children let in free - fulfilling a promise made by the prime minister last year. The cash flow problems grew worse in the opening month, as sponsors held back payment in protest over the inital chaotic queueing, particularly for the Body Zone, and other problems. \"There is no doubt that by the time the dome opened, the management team was exhausted. They had had far too many pressures on them.

But the Tate is a very different matter from going down to Greenwich, paying \u00a357 and giving a day to it,\" she said. \"The public needed to be very, very sure of what they were getting.\" At the time of Ms Page's sacking it was widely reported that sponsors had demanded her head as the price of their continuing support. However the committee was assured by representatives of three of the biggest sponsors - Manpower, Boots and BT - that they never called for her sacking. David Clayton-Smith, former director of customer marketing at Boots, admitted Boots had not paid \u00a32m of its \u00a312m sponsorship.

The Conservatives have denounced the government's annual report as an expensive piece of party political propaganda. Tony Blair introduced the concept two years ago, to set out how well the government had delivered key manifesto commitments. The two annual reports so far have been glowing endorsements of the government's achievements, with few or no references to omissions or failures. Labour officials now want to give next month's report greater credibility by injecting a stronger statistical element, and ensuring all the statistics have been squared with official bodies. The report will show how many public service targets have been met. Government backbenchers have been echoing the criticism voiced in focus groups that the party is seen as all spin and no substance. Gordon Prentice, a Labour backbench MP, has been urging Downing Street for months to hand its record to independent scrutiny, either by the National Audit Office or the newly strengthened Office of National Statistics, overseen by an independent National Statistical Commission (NSC).

      "body": "<p>The last royal marines withdrew from Sierra Leone yesterday as Britain's deputy prime minister, John Prescott, visited Freetown to assure its government of continued backing from London for the war against the Revolutionary United Front.</p> <p>But many people in Sierra Leone are not persuaded that the strengthened United Nations force which the British are leaving behind will guarantee security or maintain military pressure on the rebels. The RUF already appeared to be testing the UN's resolve with an attack yesterday on Nigerian peacekeepers near Port Loko, northeast of the capital. The UN said the rebels were beaten off.</p> <p>Some senior British and Sierra Leonean officials privately say they believe Britain is pulling the bulk of its forces out too early, given that the military expertise and the psychological impact of British forces have been crucial to keeping the RUF at bay.</p> <p>Mr Prescott insisted that Britain was not withdrawing from Sierra Leone but merely scaling down its forces from a high of more than 1,000 combat troops now that the immediate rebel threat to the capital has been staved off.</p> <p>A 90-strong British team will remain to train Sierra Leone's new army along with about 200 troops to provide security, including members of the SAS, and a couple of ships offshore.</p> <p>\"We aren't leaving,\" said Mr Prescott. \"We've brought an element of stability and now we're moving to the second stage of restoring and helping in the democracy.\"</p> <p>Last month, President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah called on Tony Blair to keep the British combat force in Sierra Leone. Yesterday the president said, \"We would have preferred for them to remain here forever,\" but added: \"The British government has promised to help us in carrying forward the stability they have brought.\"</p> <p>The commander of the British force, Brigadier David Richards, left Sierra Leone saying he believed the intervention six weeks ago probably prevented the rebels from taking Freetown and had galvanised the UN and pro-government forces.</p> <p>\"I think if we hadn't stiffened the UN's resolve at a critical time\", he said, \"and materially assisted in the defensive arrangement on the outskirts of Freetown it would have been very different.</p> <p>\"There was the effect on morale, and the direction we gave to people either directly or subtly, particularly in relation to government forces which didn't exist.\"</p> <p>He is almost certainly right. It is now clear that the RUF took about 500 United Nations peacekeepers hostage at the beginning of last month in a bid to prevent the UN from resisting a rebel takeover.</p> <p>Most of the peacekeepers capitulated without resistance, reinforcing the perception of the UN as weak and unwilling to fight. About 200 Zambians surrendered to just 20 rebels, handing over 13 armoured vehicles subsequently used in RUF assaults. A few days later, Jordanian peacekeepers fled long before the RUF reached their position.</p> <p>The rebels' seizure of the hostages paralysed the UN. The force commander, Major-General Vijay Jetley, appeared more concerned with winning their release than with the RUF threat to Freetown. He insisted that his men had no mandate to do more than defend themselves. They seemed unwilling to do even that.</p> <p>The arrival of the British military gave some backbone to the UN and a breathing space to the government. The troops oversaw the rapid shaping of the Sierra Leone army and helped ensure that rival forces - notably soldiers loyal to former military ruler Johnny Paul Koroma, and the Kamajor militia - threw their weight behind the government.</p> <p>The British also laid out a military strategy to drive the RUF from around Freetown, and to seize the rebel headquarters inland at Makeni and the diamond mines which have funded their war.</p> <p>But while the capital is secure for now, the army advance towards Makeni has stalled and it will be weeks or months before an assault on the diamond areas is possible, especially with the rains coming.</p> <p>There is considerable scepticism among British and Sierra Leonean officials that the UN will move into and defend those areas newly captured by government forces.</p> <p>British officials say that Gen Jetley has now been per suaded by them and by UN headquarters in New York that self-defence can still permit peacekeepers to take the initiative against any rebel threat to UN forces or civilians.</p> <p>But the RUF has once again taken peacekeepers hostage, this time 21 Indians who are members of Gen Jetley's own army, and the UN in Sierra Leone is again talking about the need to avoid any actions that might endanger the captives' safety. Some government officials fear that is once again a code word for inaction.</p> <p>The UN is keen to shift the emphasis towards negotiation. An Organisation of African Unity delegation is in Freetown to press for a ceasefire but Mr Kabbah says his government will not agree to a cessation of hostilities until the rebels leave areas they have seized since last year's peace accords.</p> <p>These include many diamond mines that were under the control not of the RUF but of the army loyal to the former military regime and which now backs the government.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The last royal marines withdrew from Sierra Leone yesterday as Britain's deputy prime minister, John Prescott, visited Freetown to assure its government of continued backing from London for the war against the Revolutionary United Front. But many people in Sierra Leone are not persuaded that the strengthened United Nations force which the British are leaving behind will guarantee security or maintain military pressure on the rebels. The RUF already appeared to be testing the UN's resolve with an attack yesterday on Nigerian peacekeepers near Port Loko, northeast of the capital. The UN said the rebels were beaten off. Some senior British and Sierra Leonean officials privately say they believe Britain is pulling the bulk of its forces out too early, given that the military expertise and the psychological impact of British forces have been crucial to keeping the RUF at bay. Mr Prescott insisted that Britain was not withdrawing from Sierra Leone but merely scaling down its forces from a high of more than 1,000 combat troops now that the immediate rebel threat to the capital has been staved off. A 90-strong British team will remain to train Sierra Leone's new army along with about 200 troops to provide security, including members of the SAS, and a couple of ships offshore. \"We aren't leaving,\" said Mr Prescott. \"We've brought an element of stability and now we're moving to the second stage of restoring and helping in the democracy.\" Last month, President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah called on Tony Blair to keep the British combat force in Sierra Leone. Yesterday the president said, \"We would have preferred for them to remain here forever,\" but added: \"The British government has promised to help us in carrying forward the stability they have brought.\" The commander of the British force, Brigadier David Richards, left Sierra Leone saying he believed the intervention six weeks ago probably prevented the rebels from taking Freetown and had galvanised the UN and pro-government forces. \"I think if we hadn't stiffened the UN's resolve at a critical time\", he said, \"and materially assisted in the defensive arrangement on the outskirts of Freetown it would have been very different. \"There was the effect on morale, and the direction we gave to people either directly or subtly, particularly in relation to government forces which didn't exist.\" He is almost certainly right. It is now clear that the RUF took about 500 United Nations peacekeepers hostage at the beginning of last month in a bid to prevent the UN from resisting a rebel takeover. Most of the peacekeepers capitulated without resistance, reinforcing the perception of the UN as weak and unwilling to fight. About 200 Zambians surrendered to just 20 rebels, handing over 13 armoured vehicles subsequently used in RUF assaults. A few days later, Jordanian peacekeepers fled long before the RUF reached their position. The rebels' seizure of the hostages paralysed the UN. The force commander, Major-General Vijay Jetley, appeared more concerned with winning their release than with the RUF threat to Freetown. He insisted that his men had no mandate to do more than defend themselves. They seemed unwilling to do even that. The arrival of the British military gave some backbone to the UN and a breathing space to the government. The troops oversaw the rapid shaping of the Sierra Leone army and helped ensure that rival forces - notably soldiers loyal to former military ruler Johnny Paul Koroma, and the Kamajor militia - threw their weight behind the government. The British also laid out a military strategy to drive the RUF from around Freetown, and to seize the rebel headquarters inland at Makeni and the diamond mines which have funded their war. But while the capital is secure for now, the army advance towards Makeni has stalled and it will be weeks or months before an assault on the diamond areas is possible, especially with the rains coming. There is considerable scepticism among British and Sierra Leonean officials that the UN will move into and defend those areas newly captured by government forces. British officials say that Gen Jetley has now been per suaded by them and by UN headquarters in New York that self-defence can still permit peacekeepers to take the initiative against any rebel threat to UN forces or civilians. But the RUF has once again taken peacekeepers hostage, this time 21 Indians who are members of Gen Jetley's own army, and the UN in Sierra Leone is again talking about the need to avoid any actions that might endanger the captives' safety. Some government officials fear that is once again a code word for inaction. The UN is keen to shift the emphasis towards negotiation. An Organisation of African Unity delegation is in Freetown to press for a ceasefire but Mr Kabbah says his government will not agree to a cessation of hostilities until the rebels leave areas they have seized since last year's peace accords. These include many diamond mines that were under the control not of the RUF but of the army loyal to the former military regime and which now backs the government.",

A new venture by Great North Eastern Railways to run Eurostar trains between the two cities has been set back by Railtrack's ruling that the trains cannot operate between 7-10am and 4-7pm. The official reason is that there is so much overload on the power lines during this crucial period that the 125mph Eurostar trains might break down. A GNER spokesman said last night: \"We were told that there was a danger that we might blow out all electric kettles and television sets between King's Cross and Peterborough if we tried to run the trains.\" The 14-coach Eurostar sets have been hired by GNER to combat overcrowding on the line. They will provide an extra 2m seats a year and complement the company's new tilting trains when they are introduced in the next few years. The Eurostar units, which cost around \u00a320m each, are part of the ill-fated fleet of regional Eurostar trains destined for routes from locations north of London to Paris. They have been mothballed for five years. GNER has also been prevented by Eurostar from using its name and has been forced to provide what is essentially an off-peak service only to passengers. The service is running under the title the GNER white rose service. GNER will have to wait for at least another two years before Railtrack can produce enough power to move the trains through the day. A Railtrack spokeswoman said that the company was in the process of upgrading the line. It was trying to solve the problem as quickly as possible. \"The problem will be eliminated when we build a sub-station at Corries Mill between London and Peterborough and link it to the national grid,\" she said.",

      "body": "<p>Alberta is a child with strange demands. Her mother doesn't question them any more - she just tries to do what she asks. Alberta's latest obsession is wanting her mother to be a poet, to write poems which Alberta can learn by heart. And she wants the poems to contain these words: blood, liberty, freedom, Kosovo and warrior.</p> <p>Alberta is on her feet, a five-year-old in a velvet dress, hands by her side, on parade, a child refugee in a Leeds council house. She starts reciting: \"Kosovo, you are the old lady and I am your niece. Don't hurt me, don't kill me, don't maim me because I will always be your child.\" Then she beams and launches into another poem in honour of her father - the warrior.</p> <p>In her five-year-old mind, it was her warrior father who personally fixed the plane to bring them from the filth and overcrowding of the Koso van border last spring to Leeds, the first of 4,000 refugees offered sanctuary in Britain. Around their council estate in Potternewton in Leeds, most of the windows are now boarded up. The Home Office is insisting Kosovan refugees be out of the country by June 25; those who apply and fail to get asylum will be forcibly removed. Alberta, her mother Selvete Bakiu, her sister Njomza, three, and her brother Pamvarsimi, one, are asking for more time.</p> <p>The offer of free flights ends on June 25. The Home Office put it bluntly in its latest circular to refugee groups: \"The UK has extended generous hospitality to a vulnerable group of people in their hour of need and we have always made it quite clear that protection was given on a temporary basis only.\" Around half of the 4,000 Kosovans are still in Britain and say they need more time.</p> <p>Alberta and her family's problem is that she has no home to go to and her father, a vegetable trader in a country that is bankrupt, hasn't the means to buy a new one. Worst of all, their ruined home is in the village of Upper Bitije in eastern Kosovo, now exclusively Serb. It is virtually impossible for any Kosovan to return there, as the Serbs who stayed behind in Kosovo are isolated, angry and bitter. A Guardian photographer was only able to enter the village to photograph the ruins of Alberta's home under armed UN guard, and was warned not to bring his translator, a Kosovan Albanian, into the village.</p> <p>\"People should be allowed to return with dignity and not be forced against their will,\" says Rod Harbinson of the Refugee Council. \"At the moment, the political climate in the UK is very hostile. Some people have real concerns about returning. There's no medical treatment in Kosovo for people who have cancer or heart disease, there are concerns about landmines, some people have no houses. For others, it's just a question of wanting their kids to be able to finish summer term at school.\"</p> <p>When their home was torched, Selvete was forced to gag Njomza with her headscarf to stop the child screaming as their house burned. \"When they took Daddy away that was the worst,\" says Alberta. \"But I was really scared when we were hiding. Njomza was stupid; she was trying to scream and we nearly got killed.\"</p> <p>At dawn they fled their village and for six months stayed with relatives. Then they spent a month hiding in the mountains living on hoards of potatoes that locals had buried, knowing what was coming. \"Then Daddy came and took us to Leeds,\" continues Alberta. \"He fixed everything. Now he is in Kosovo, building a lovely new super house for us, but he might not be able to do it if the house is too expensive.\"</p> <p>\"What possible reason do I have to stay in Leeds?\" says her mother. \"Kosovo is my home, my place - everyone has their place. But we need more time to find a home. My husband is there now, looking for one for us, but he sleeps on different floors every night. I don't want to bring my children back to that. I can't explain to you how it felt when we finally arrived at the airport in Leeds. To see all those people standing there waiting to take care of us. I was so ashamed in our dirty clothes. We weren't looking our best, but they kept telling us it didn't matter.\"</p> <p>Selvete says Alberta has taken to behaving like a mother herself: \"When I cry, she says to me, 'Mummy, what is it? Why are you crying?' And then she recites like a list, 'Is it because the house was burnt? Is it because Uncle Mome got killed? Is it because Daddy is not here?'\"</p> <p>The Home Office remains rigid: \"Those who stay beyond the 25th are technically overstayers and are liable for enforcement action,\" says a spokesman. But the Refugee Council says Kosovans need to be treated as individuals and their safety taken into account. \"The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has advised the Home Office not to force people out of the UK who come from Serb-dominated areas. The Home Office should be listening to that advice,\" says Harbinson.</p> <p>Another woman who faces danger is Julianna, who asks that her full name not be printed. She is 56, and lives in London after fleeing Kosovo. But her elderly mother married a Serb, and now Julianna is frightened to go back. \"I went back for three weeks but it was clear I couldn't stay,\" she says. \"My town, Pristina, is still full of people from the villages; they want revenge because it was they who suffered the most.\"</p> <p>A former press officer with a large cement company, she speaks perfect English. \"They made my mother burn every book in the house that was written in Serb. She is 80 and she had to go up and down the stairs bringing down all the books to be burned. I need to be patient. Sometimes, in London, I still think that it didn't happen . . . the men in masks who took our money and our gold as we queued for two days at the border. They were something from a movie. But I remember the worst thing was being in the middle of thousands and thousands of people having nowhere private to be able to go to the toilet.\"</p> <p>Back in Leeds, the children are watching afternoon television and playing with Pok\u00e9mon. Selvete doesn't know how her family will adjust to the return but for now she is busy coping with her oldest daughter's obsession with poems.</p> <p>The translator asks Alberta what she remembers most about Kosovo, and the five-year-old jumps up: \"I am little. I don't know very much of my beautiful Kosovo . . .\"</p>",

But we need more time to find a home. My husband is there now, looking for one for us, but he sleeps on different floors every night. I don't want to bring my children back to that. I can't explain to you how it felt when we finally arrived at the airport in Leeds. To see all those people standing there waiting to take care of us. I was so ashamed in our dirty clothes. We weren't looking our best, but they kept telling us it didn't matter.\" Selvete says Alberta has taken to behaving like a mother herself: \"When I cry, she says to me, 'Mummy, what is it? Why are you crying?' And then she recites like a list, 'Is it because the house was burnt? Is it because Uncle Mome got killed? Is it because Daddy is not here?'\" The Home Office remains rigid: \"Those who stay beyond the 25th are technically overstayers and are liable for enforcement action,\" says a spokesman. But the Refugee Council says Kosovans need to be treated as individuals and their safety taken into account. \"The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has advised the Home Office not to force people out of the UK who come from Serb-dominated areas. The Home Office should be listening to that advice,\" says Harbinson. Another woman who faces danger is Julianna, who asks that her full name not be printed. She is 56, and lives in London after fleeing Kosovo. But her elderly mother married a Serb, and now Julianna is frightened to go back. \"I went back for three weeks but it was clear I couldn't stay,\" she says. \"My town, Pristina, is still full of people from the villages; they want revenge because it was they who suffered the most.\" A former press officer with a large cement company, she speaks perfect English. \"They made my mother burn every book in the house that was written in Serb. She is 80 and she had to go up and down the stairs bringing down all the books to be burned. I need to be patient. Sometimes, in London, I still think that it didn't happen . . . the men in masks who took our money and our gold as we queued for two days at the border. They were something from a movie. But I remember the worst thing was being in the middle of thousands and thousands of people having nowhere private to be able to go to the toilet.\" Back in Leeds, the children are watching afternoon television and playing with Pok\u00e9mon. Selvete doesn't know how her family will adjust to the return but for now she is busy coping with her oldest daughter's obsession with poems. The translator asks Alberta what she remembers most about Kosovo, and the five-year-old jumps up: \"I am little. I don't know very much of my beautiful Kosovo . . .\"",

And should she receive an injury award and pension in another action, she could get a further \u00a3680,000, pushing her payout to well over \u00a31m.

John Scourse, chairman of the institute and fundraiser for Guide Dogs for the Blind, said: \"It's worked well, but the Three Peaks walk is a very popular and effective fundraiser for small groups who are beyond our orbit. \"The only way to deal with that is for the charity sector to get together and spread the word ... It's a matter of doing things sensibly and, I'm afraid, not doing the Three Peaks at all.\"",

It will have a terrible effect on mining and the entire economy.\"</p> <p>Many businesses are still coming to terms with the decision to confiscate more than 800 farms in Zimbabwe.</p> <p>The president told the Johannesburg Star newspaper: \"After land, now we must look at the mining sector ... At the end of the day black people must be able to say 'Ah, the resources are ours. Our people own the mines. Our people own the industry'.\"</p> <p>Mining is a key element in Zimbabwe's economy, accounting for about 30% of export earnings. The country has about 1,000 mines, of which 800 are owned by Zimbabweans, but the big mines owned by multinationals account for 60% of production.</p> <p>Nick von Schirnding, Anglo American's senior vice-president of investor corporate affairs, said that Mr Mugabe's statement might have been pre-election \"politicking\" rather than a direct threat.</p> <p>\"Anglo has certainly not been approached on this issue\", he said. \"We are confident in the long-term future of Zimbabwe.

      "bodyText": "Zimbabwe's business community reacted with alarm yesterday to President Robert Mugabe's threat to seize the country's mines, warning that nationalisations would severely damage the already ailing industry. Anglo American, the giant conglomerate which is by far the largest gold and nickel mining producer in Zimbabwe, described the president's comments as \"unhelpful\" for investor confidence. \"It's disastrous,\" said a local mining executive with Anglo American. \"Just by making such a statement Mugabe is weakening Zimbabwe's mining sector. It will have a terrible effect on mining and the entire economy.\" Many businesses are still coming to terms with the decision to confiscate more than 800 farms in Zimbabwe. The president told the Johannesburg Star newspaper: \"After land, now we must look at the mining sector ... At the end of the day black people must be able to say 'Ah, the resources are ours. Our people own the mines. Our people own the industry'.\" Mining is a key element in Zimbabwe's economy, accounting for about 30% of export earnings. The country has about 1,000 mines, of which 800 are owned by Zimbabweans, but the big mines owned by multinationals account for 60% of production. Nick von Schirnding, Anglo American's senior vice-president of investor corporate affairs, said that Mr Mugabe's statement might have been pre-election \"politicking\" rather than a direct threat. \"Anglo has certainly not been approached on this issue\", he said. \"We are confident in the long-term future of Zimbabwe. Of prime concern is economic and political stability, the rule of law and policy certainty. Free and fair elections are particularly important for investor confidence.\" The United Kingdom is the largest private sector investor in Zimbabwe, with holdings estimated to be worth \u00a3350m. The Confederation of British Industry said: \"This is potentially the start of a downward spiral which will not only critically damage Zimbabwe's economic capacity, but threatens to undermine fatally investor confidence in the country.\" The Foreign Office dismissed Mr Mugabe's remarks as \"posturing\" before the elections, due on June 24-25. \"This cannot help Zimbabwean jobs, wealth and opportunities. Zimbabwe is currently suffering from a crippling shortage of foreign exchange and a weak Zimbabwean dollar,\" said the Foreign Office minister Peter Hain. \"These threats only make matters worse and, if carried out, would risk bankrupting the country.\" President Mugabe is not learning from history, warned John Robertson, a Zimbabwean economist with extensive experience in mining. \"Look what happened to other African countries that nationalised their mines.

Invented by a gaggle of college students led by Fanning it was embraced by hordes of dedicated users before ever registering on a financial analyst's chart. Only months ago it seemed well on the way to being transformed into a more conventional Silicon Valley start-up. </p> <p>The key was sharing music. Napster, which makes it simple to find and trade MP3 music files with other fans, soon had a global user base - all bent on uploading their favourite tracks on to the site so others could download them. </p> <p>The result was an explosion in free music being swapped over the net. That frightened record companies and musicians. Metallica, the heavy metal band, was first to strike back - asking for lists of users passing on its music. In response a group of programmers set up a site, Metallicster, to swap the group's tracks. </p> <p>Not all thought Metallica was right. Chuck D of Public Enemy and Courtney Love have both been vocal fans of Napster. But other champions of MP3 found themselves in the firing line. In landmark cases, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) filed a court injunction on Monday against online music company Napster, and last week forced MP3.com to pay out $40m in a settlement with Time Warner Music and Bertelsmann's BMG Entertainment. </p> <p>Film executives were quick to support the record industry's claim that services like Napster were a \"breeding ground for widespread copyright infringement\". MP3.com, with nearly half a million subscribers, still faces a challenge from three other labels - Sony Music Entertainment, Seagram's Universal and EMI. The payout to Warner Music and BMG allows MP3.com to licence the labels' songs for use on its database. The online company will also pay a royalty each time music is logged on its system. </p> <p>The music industry appears to have the upper hand - but others are waiting in the wings to take Fanning's place. One who might is computer programmer Ian Clarke, a 23-year-old developer of anti-censorship software. He says big business is going to have to rethink its strategy. </p> <p>Clarke, who designs online-auction software for a company called Instil, has designed a program called Freenet which provides a system of information exchange of the kind that is under attack by the big players in the entertainment business. </p> <p>The key to Freenet is that it will pluck information from the net without telling you were it came from. Napster's undoing was that record companies could identify people because its server kept records of who sent or downloaded music. </p> <p>Had Freenet been used to scour the net for MP3 files, the thinking runs, no one could have traced who made copies or where they came from. Many in the industry are aware of the implications. A precursor of Freenet called Gnutella, created by two AOL workers, has been described as a \"benevolent virus\". </p> <p>Clarke is unfazed. The issue of copyright infringement, which could cost the music industry more than $10bn a year, has raised questions that \"even a year ago would have been dismissed as lunatic,\" he says. \"The question is, is copyright necessary or could we live without it? I believe that information should be free and that people's creative output is for the benefit of everyone. There are other business models that can be used to generate revenue and reward people for their creative output.\" </p> <p><strong> Natural heir</strong><br> </p> <p> Without giving too much away, Clarke hints that while he is considering several opportunities, the combination of his technical ability and the runaway success of online music may be too much to resist. In response to critics who say the artist loses out, Clarke says he is investigating the \"digital distribution of music in a way that would help artists\". </p> <p>There are many who see Freenet as a natural heir to the Napster crown and many say the music industry is in for a bigger shock. Janelle Brown, one of web-based Salon magazine's technology writers, pointed out: \"If a judge grants the proposed injunction, the fans booted off Napster will probably just flock straight to Freenet or Gnutella, which are competing open source file-swapping technologies. With no corporate backers and scores of unknown users hosting the software on their private machines, services like Gnutella will never cut deals with record labels or musicians. They will never take in subscription fees.\" </p> <p>Whatever the business model, it appears Clarke and designers like him will be up against entertainment chiefs like Disney chief Michael Eisner and Seagram's Edgar Bronfman who make no secret of their determination to stamp out unauthorised distribution of their copyrighted material. A software platform which circumvents censorship cannot make him popular with government either. But Clarke says they are way behind the curve. \"Even if they put a gun to my head, there's no technical or legal way [Freenet's] system could be shut down, or that you could trace what was put into it,\" he claims. \"It was designed to withstand attack.\" </p> <p>The son of a County Meath shopkeeper, Clarke wrote his first computer program on an Atari 800 XL (which he used mainly for computer games) at age 8. He says \"it would probably have violated software patents in the US\". Self-taught until university, he set about investigating his idea as part of his thesis in artificial intelligence and computer science. \"I was only reasonably computer literate - no more than others - but the computer is only a tool; it's the idea that counts.\" </p> <p>The idea that there would be no person, computer or organisation in control of Freenet led to the development of the peer-to-peer or \"Chinese whispers\" platform, coupled with strong encryption and \"intelligent routing\" which renders its users anonymous. </p> <p>Although motivated more by technology than politics, Clarke has since become something of a crusader against censorship; he considers moves to block free access to music on the net to be an infringement of free speech. Lately it is the regulation of internet powers bill which has got him fired up. \"I never trusted politicians with the internet and this bill proves that government cannot be trusted to legislate on these matters\", he said. \"The British government is moving in the wrong direction and will drive e-commerce away to countries where it is illegal to monitor internet communications.\" </p> <p><strong> 'Stupid legislation'</strong><br> </p> <p> Surely the internet is as border-free as the encrypted information platforms he designed? \"If you encrypt data, police in the UK will be able to ask for the key,\" he explains. You may otherwise be asked to prove that you do not have it. And if you tell anyone that you have been asked, you are liable for prosecution. \"It's a stupid piece of legislation - it will hurt commerce as well as civil liberties.\" </p> <p>Although Clarke says his system is \"only a tool on a simple level\", it has unnerved the music industry. Programmers like this could either find themselves very rich, or in jail.</p>",

One who might is computer programmer Ian Clarke, a 23-year-old developer of anti-censorship software. He says big business is going to have to rethink its strategy. Clarke, who designs online-auction software for a company called Instil, has designed a program called Freenet which provides a system of information exchange of the kind that is under attack by the big players in the entertainment business. The key to Freenet is that it will pluck information from the net without telling you were it came from. Napster's undoing was that record companies could identify people because its server kept records of who sent or downloaded music. Had Freenet been used to scour the net for MP3 files, the thinking runs, no one could have traced who made copies or where they came from. Many in the industry are aware of the implications. A precursor of Freenet called Gnutella, created by two AOL workers, has been described as a \"benevolent virus\". Clarke is unfazed. The issue of copyright infringement, which could cost the music industry more than $10bn a year, has raised questions that \"even a year ago would have been dismissed as lunatic,\" he says. \"The question is, is copyright necessary or could we live without it? I believe that information should be free and that people's creative output is for the benefit of everyone. There are other business models that can be used to generate revenue and reward people for their creative output.\" Natural heir Without giving too much away, Clarke hints that while he is considering several opportunities, the combination of his technical ability and the runaway success of online music may be too much to resist. In response to critics who say the artist loses out, Clarke says he is investigating the \"digital distribution of music in a way that would help artists\". There are many who see Freenet as a natural heir to the Napster crown and many say the music industry is in for a bigger shock. Janelle Brown, one of web-based Salon magazine's technology writers, pointed out: \"If a judge grants the proposed injunction, the fans booted off Napster will probably just flock straight to Freenet or Gnutella, which are competing open source file-swapping technologies. With no corporate backers and scores of unknown users hosting the software on their private machines, services like Gnutella will never cut deals with record labels or musicians. They will never take in subscription fees.\" Whatever the business model, it appears Clarke and designers like him will be up against entertainment chiefs like Disney chief Michael Eisner and Seagram's Edgar Bronfman who make no secret of their determination to stamp out unauthorised distribution of their copyrighted material. A software platform which circumvents censorship cannot make him popular with government either. But Clarke says they are way behind the curve. \"Even if they put a gun to my head, there's no technical or legal way [Freenet's] system could be shut down, or that you could trace what was put into it,\" he claims. \"It was designed to withstand attack.\" The son of a County Meath shopkeeper, Clarke wrote his first computer program on an Atari 800 XL (which he used mainly for computer games) at age 8. He says \"it would probably have violated software patents in the US\". Self-taught until university, he set about investigating his idea as part of his thesis in artificial intelligence and computer science. \"I was only reasonably computer literate - no more than others - but the computer is only a tool; it's the idea that counts.\" The idea that there would be no person, computer or organisation in control of Freenet led to the development of the peer-to-peer or \"Chinese whispers\" platform, coupled with strong encryption and \"intelligent routing\" which renders its users anonymous. Although motivated more by technology than politics, Clarke has since become something of a crusader against censorship; he considers moves to block free access to music on the net to be an infringement of free speech. Lately it is the regulation of internet powers bill which has got him fired up. \"I never trusted politicians with the internet and this bill proves that government cannot be trusted to legislate on these matters\", he said. \"The British government is moving in the wrong direction and will drive e-commerce away to countries where it is illegal to monitor internet communications.\" 'Stupid legislation' Surely the internet is as border-free as the encrypted information platforms he designed? \"If you encrypt data, police in the UK will be able to ask for the key,\" he explains. You may otherwise be asked to prove that you do not have it. And if you tell anyone that you have been asked, you are liable for prosecution. \"It's a stupid piece of legislation - it will hurt commerce as well as civil liberties.\" Although Clarke says his system is \"only a tool on a simple level\", it has unnerved the music industry. Programmers like this could either find themselves very rich, or in jail.",

But, welcoming Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to the White House, even the normally optimistic Mr Clinton seemed downbeat over the prospects of pushing the slow-moving Middle East peace process closer to an elusive settlement. \"If we are going to make peace, we are going to have to deal with the difficult issues,\" Mr Clinton said. He would dearly love to crown his troubled second term with a major Middle East agreement. But high White House hopes at the start of this year have slumped in recent days. The death of the Syrian leader Hafaz al-Assad and the break-up of Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak's coalition have combined to make progress on either leg of the Middle East talks far more uncertain than ever. Mr Clinton seems to have accepted that the vision of a second Camp David-style three-way agreement involving the US, Israel and the Palestinians is currently unattainable. In spite of the official caution over this week's talks, the administration aims to do almost anything in its power to contrive a big foreign policy triumph in the closing months of Mr Clinton's presidency. Last month, he managed a rare international trade success on Capitol Hill, when Congress approved the administration's China trade normalisation legislation. But that victory owed as much to Mr Clinton's Republican opponents, who provided most of the votes in favour of the measure, as it did to the president himself. Hopes that this month's Moscow meeting with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, might lead to a triumph for Mr Clinton's diplomacy on the missile defence issue were dashed by Mr Putin's refusal to support Washington's proposal to amend the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. Indeed, even some in the White House admit Mr Putin had much the better of the Moscow meeting, and the Russian leader has since pressed home his advantage with a series of west European visits which seem to be driving a wedge between Europe and the US on the missile defence issue. \"Putin is running rings round us right now,\" a senior White House source confessed. The administration is now looking to the Tony Blair connection and the Northern Ireland agreement to provide the president with his elusive final foreign flourish. If Mr Blair gives the word that conditions in Northern Ireland allow it, then Mr Clinton will again be on Air Force One heading for Britain and Ireland to bask one last time in local approval for an agreement in which no one disputes he played a central and sustained role. The attractions of an Irish visit are at least as strong for Hillary Clinton, who would love such a perfect opportunity to play to the Irish gallery in New York just before the official start of her Senate campaign there in September. \u0095 Israel has apologised to the UN after its troops fired over the heads of UN peacekeepers yesterday when cartographers in south Lebanon tried to open a border gate. The UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, informed the Lebanese president, Emile Lahoud, of the apology and said Israel had promised such incidents would not be repeated.",

The \"cosy\" comes in when statuesque women strut into the coffee shop looking for rich, eligible young men.

Forbidden to socialise comfortably in public, Iranians have for 20 years been hosting family gatherings and parties with friends strictly inside their homes. Going to a public place to pass the time has become an alien idea. \"There is nothing to do in Iran. Now, at least we can go somewhere and have a cup of coffee,\" said Afsane, one patron. \"But people like those over there are too showy,\" she complained, pointing her hands, painted with green nail polish, at the coffee shop window. Another coffee shop across the street from the Cosy Corner had been in business for about one year until it closed recently. The owner's wife accused him of flirting with the fashionable young women who were his patrons. He had lived in fear that the police or the Islamic militia would close him down once they discovered young men and women were socialising in the coffee shop. Last November, a CNN television crew wanted to film the scene for a programme on the decadent lifestyles of Iran's wealthy youth. But the owner prohibited them from taking shots of his coffee shop because he thought the programme would provoke the authorities. But Ms Emami says the police do not bother her customers as long as there are no public displays of affection. At another trendy coffee shop, the Strawberry Cafe in the Vanak district of Tehran, customers say the police have stopped bothering them, too. The new coffee shops in Tehran offer an alternative to the most established venue, the Cafe Naderi, in the city centre and known before the 1979 revolution as a gathering place for secular intellectuals. Furnished with ageing original wooden chairs and linoleum tables, Cafe Naderi's management say they have no plans to surrender to modernity. Once home to writers such as Sadeq Hedayat, Iran's Kafka who committed suicide in Paris in 1951, Cafe Naderi still attracts primarily an older crowd, and a few of young students who appreciate an artistic atmosphere. \"I like the Naderi better than Strawberry because it is authentic,\" said Saba, a 20-year-old university student drinking an Iranian-made cola. Davoud Roshan, Naderi's manager, says his intention is to keep the cafe the same. He could not say how old the Naderi was, but he said it existed when the British were the leading power in Iran. He hinted, however, that he might set up tables and chairs in a sprawling garden extending from the cafe. \"We used to have tables out there but we brought them in during the Iran-Iraq war [of 1980-88] when the shelling was hitting Tehran.

      "body": "<p>The cost of policing fox hunting in England is already an estimated \u00a31m a year - with just three of the home counties having to spend more than \u00a3377,000, it was revealed yesterday.</p> <p>Figures supplied by police authorities to the Liberal Democrats on the cost of hunt policing are certain to fuel the row over a future ban. On Monday the Conservative frontbench spokesman, David Lidington, announced the Tories intended to make the cost of policing a plank in their opposition to a ban, pointing out that enforcing it would hit the constabulary in \"hard- pressed rural areas\".</p> <p>The most detailed analysis, according to figures released to Norman Baker, Liberal Democrat MP for Lewes, comes from the Sussex police authority. It reveals it had to set up Operation Rook to deal with hunting and has spent \u00a3135,828 this year. Altogether, 115 hunts are policed every year and on average 77 officers are engaged in policing them every week. Most of the officers have to be moved from other duties protecting the public. The authority also puts on an \"awareness day\" for hunt organisers at its police headquarters before the season begins.</p> <p>Kent police force estimates it spends \u00a3125,000 a year sending officers to check 212 hunts and hunt balls and investigate complaints and offences connected with local hunts.</p> <p>Essex estimates its cost at \u00a3117,625, with \u00a3110,427 spent on paying officers to police hunts. Other figures released include \u00a355,000 spent by Northamptonshire police, although it put the blame for the bill entirely on protesters trying to disrupt hunting.</p> <p>Other police authorities quoted lower sums. Dorset said it cost \u00a322,822, Humberside \u00a316,000 and Staffordshire \u00a315,000. Some police authorities quoted sums as low as \u00a32,126 for Bedfordshire and \u00a3200 for Derbyshire. But most authorities did not include the full cost of police salaries or office backup.</p> <p>The total figure obtained by the Liberal Democrats was \u00a3542,854 - but this is a huge underestimate, because several of the authorities which have a large number of hunts did not reply. These included Devon and Cornwall, which have hunts on Exmoor, Dartmoor and Bodmin Moor; Wiltshire, which includes the Beaufort Hunt at Badminton - a favourite venue for Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles and an expensive event to police. Other counties who did not reply include Gloucestershire, Cumbria, Thames Valley and Hertfordshire.</p> <p>A number of police authorities also do not keep separate records. Cambridgeshire, Suffolk, Warwickshire and Leicestershire are among these.</p> <p>A small number of authorities also did not have a policy to police hunts. These included Lancashire, Lincolnshire and Norfolk. Two authorities, West Mercia and Cleveland, said they already had no hunting in their areas.</p> <p>Mr Baker said yesterday: \"This research clearly backs up the need for action to ban hunting.

      "bodyText": "The cost of policing fox hunting in England is already an estimated \u00a31m a year - with just three of the home counties having to spend more than \u00a3377,000, it was revealed yesterday. Figures supplied by police authorities to the Liberal Democrats on the cost of hunt policing are certain to fuel the row over a future ban. On Monday the Conservative frontbench spokesman, David Lidington, announced the Tories intended to make the cost of policing a plank in their opposition to a ban, pointing out that enforcing it would hit the constabulary in \"hard- pressed rural areas\". The most detailed analysis, according to figures released to Norman Baker, Liberal Democrat MP for Lewes, comes from the Sussex police authority. It reveals it had to set up Operation Rook to deal with hunting and has spent \u00a3135,828 this year. Altogether, 115 hunts are policed every year and on average 77 officers are engaged in policing them every week. Most of the officers have to be moved from other duties protecting the public. The authority also puts on an \"awareness day\" for hunt organisers at its police headquarters before the season begins. Kent police force estimates it spends \u00a3125,000 a year sending officers to check 212 hunts and hunt balls and investigate complaints and offences connected with local hunts. Essex estimates its cost at \u00a3117,625, with \u00a3110,427 spent on paying officers to police hunts. Other figures released include \u00a355,000 spent by Northamptonshire police, although it put the blame for the bill entirely on protesters trying to disrupt hunting. Other police authorities quoted lower sums. Dorset said it cost \u00a322,822, Humberside \u00a316,000 and Staffordshire \u00a315,000. Some police authorities quoted sums as low as \u00a32,126 for Bedfordshire and \u00a3200 for Derbyshire. But most authorities did not include the full cost of police salaries or office backup. The total figure obtained by the Liberal Democrats was \u00a3542,854 - but this is a huge underestimate, because several of the authorities which have a large number of hunts did not reply. These included Devon and Cornwall, which have hunts on Exmoor, Dartmoor and Bodmin Moor; Wiltshire, which includes the Beaufort Hunt at Badminton - a favourite venue for Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles and an expensive event to police. Other counties who did not reply include Gloucestershire, Cumbria, Thames Valley and Hertfordshire. A number of police authorities also do not keep separate records. Cambridgeshire, Suffolk, Warwickshire and Leicestershire are among these. A small number of authorities also did not have a policy to police hunts. These included Lancashire, Lincolnshire and Norfolk. Two authorities, West Mercia and Cleveland, said they already had no hunting in their areas. Mr Baker said yesterday: \"This research clearly backs up the need for action to ban hunting. It suggests that if a ban had been introduced police authorities would be able to save money. Police numbers are stretched enough as it is, without the unwelcome diversion of policing hunts.\" The opposite view is argued by the Countryside Alliance, the pro-blood sport body. In its evidence to the Burns inquiry its representatives argued that police resources were already heavily overstretched and officers would not have time to enforce a ban, which would be given a low priority.",

      "bodyText": "In Age Gap (2.15pm, Radio 4) Peter Tinniswood portrays two characters who might have stepped straight out of a Lowry painting. At 26, Anita has been put into a rest-home because her husband can no longer care for her. She is, naturally, housed with the next youngest patient. But Winifred is 62 and inhabits an inchoately jumbled past. Somehow the two must find a way of jogging along together. Owney Madden headed the New York Gopher Gang in 1923 and was doing rather well out of Prohibition. But he lacked a place for the boys to relax in after a hard day's bootlegging. The obvious answer was a new night spot in Harlem, which could also offer the city's rich white jazz fans somewhere safe to hear the increasingly popular black bands. And so began The Cotton Club (10.0pm, Radio 2). George Melly (pictured) launches a four-part history of one of America's most influential musical institutions.",

SL Oxford All you will get is a fling I noticed from your letter that although the man said he had never done this sort of thing before, he did not make any mention of leaving his wife. Whenever your emotions are involved in any situation it is very difficult to be objective. However, the chances are that he has done this sort of thing before (particularly if his wife leaves him to his own devices regularly because of her job).

I also think that the way the relationship started, with you spending an evening with a man you would normally have walked away from had you not been drinking, speaks volumes.

The irony of this post- modernism is that it has given us a fascination with the pre-modern. Perhaps we are lapping up what we can read about significant moments in the construction of modernity because we sense we are in the middle of another shift in what we know and think.

If you put that in the present, people have all sorts of prejudices about feminism and so on.

Presentation is a high art form - dishes (troughs) arrive with everything together - a mountain of creamy, monster mash with sausages jammed in at angles and gravy everywhere. It is a bit of a canteen - benches, smoke and noise. Not a trace of subtlety or sophistication. Great for groups or losing yourself in a crowd.

Tel: 020-7792 1246 Why is it that pubs have taken to Thai grub in such a major way? The Churchill is one of the better experiences in London, boozer in front, restaurant complete with rain forest d\u00e9cor at back. No common or garden fish tank bubbling quietly away in the corner here. Quick, slick service from usually friendly waitresses, frequently of South African origin. Decent, standard Thai dishes; variations on the stir fry/green curry/chilli fresh salads, plus rice or noodles. Nothing too fiddly, fancy or expensive - \u00a38 a head for food average. Proximity to pub gives it a kind of buzz. But popular in its own right, so book. Quick bites . . . where to eat out in under 15 minutes Sausage &amp; Mash Cafe , 268 Portobello Road, London W10. Tel: 020-8968 8898 All the world loves a sausage. The S&amp;M does them in style - comfort food for the day before, the morning after, and right now this minute. There's a gallery of about eight broad-shouldered bangers including a decent veggie option, plus six kinds of mash and five gravies. Presentation is a high art form - dishes (troughs) arrive with everything together - a mountain of creamy, monster mash with sausages jammed in at angles and gravy everywhere. It is a bit of a canteen - benches, smoke and noise. Not a trace of subtlety or sophistication. Great for groups or losing yourself in a crowd. Wine if you want/need it.

Mr Straw has done so in a letter to Richard Burden, Labour MP for Birmingham Northfield, who raised the case in response to concern expressed by a constituent, a member of the National Union of Journalists. Mr Burden drew the home secretary's attention to a Commons motion signed by over 40 MPs of all parties expressing concern at \"the assault on independent journalism represented by the attempt to intimidate the Guardian, the Observer, and the reporter Martin Bright, by obtaining orders under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to force them to surrender information relating to contacts with David Shayler, which was either in the public domain or has been supplied to ministers by Mr Shayler himself\".

He refers to article 10 of the European convention covering freedom of expression but stresses that this principle can be subject to restrictions \"necessary in a democratic society\".

      "bodyText": "Court clears Rwandan bishop A Rwandan court yesterday acquitted a Roman Catholic bishop of genocide charges, ruling that he played no part in the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Tutsis. Bishop Augustin Misago had been accused of helping to plan the genocide in 1994, but had consistently maintained his innocence and had won the support of the Pope and senior Vatican officials. \"All accusations against Misago have been dropped. Misago is free. Misago has won the trial,\" said Jariel Sekarusu, president of the criminal court in the capital, Kigali. Reuters, Kigali Two Serbs killed by landmine Two Kosovan Serbs were killed and a third was injured yesterday when their van hit a landmine in an incident that international officials called an act of ethnic violence. The victims were driving a red van towards the railway tracks in the village of Lepine, south-west of the provincial capital Pristina, when it ran over the mine. Reuters, Lepine Film star snubs Algerian leader The French film star, Isabelle Adjani, has boycotted a state dinner honouring the Algerian president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, saying she refused to become an accomplice to continuing human rights abuses in Algeria. \"There's still no justice worthy of that name in Algeria and 10,000 people are still missing,\" Adjani, whose father was Algerian, was quoted as saying in the daily Lib\u00e9ration. AP, Paris Bardot guilty of inciting hatred A French court convicted the French actress and animal activist Brigitte Bardot yesterday of inciting \"discrimination, hatred or racial violence\" for criticising a Muslim festival in which sheep are slaughtered. Bardot also was fined 20,000 francs (\u00a31,950) for a passage in her book published in 1999 in which she criticised the Muslim practice of killing sheep to mark the end of the holy month of Ramadan, and in which she lamented the invasion of her \"homeland\" by \"foreigners, especially Muslims\". AP, Paris US man freed from toilet A man was rescued by police near Philadelphia after he became stuck up to his hips in a portable toilet while trying to retrieve his keys. AP, Pennsylvania",

Even on Wednesday, when Alastair announced he was taking a step back, the civil service notes of the lobby briefing show he'd lost none of his vim: \"Asked where he had been over the last couple of days, the prime minister's official spokesman (PMOS) said he had been going about his business. Invited to elaborate, the PMOS said there was nothing to tell.\" Vintage stuff. \" Pressed as to what he had been doing, the PMOS said it was a matter for him, the prime minister and the government for whom he worked.

Many of the indigenous residents retreated to the countryside, where they own most of the land. An unwritten ceasefire expires next week.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the prime minister resigned and announced that a committee made up of government and opposition leaders would try to arrange peace talks.

      "bodyText": "Rebels holding Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands, said yesterday that they would let police return to their jobs, one day after they forced the country's leader to resign. But the gesture of compromise seemed empty because they did not say they would allow the police to rearm. The rebels looted guns and vehicles from police headquarters last week when they detained the prime minister, Bartholomew Ulufa'alu, at gunpoint. Last night, police said they still did not have their weapons and could not patrol effectively without them. As a result, it appeared that the well-armed militants themselves would continue to be the real enforcers of security. The rebels said in a statement that they would work with the police \"to ensure that there is a smooth transition to normal policing in Honiara\". They also said that police vehicles would be returned and a rebel-imposed curfew would remain \"until police regain adequate logistical capacity\". The document was signed by the rebel leader, Andrew Nori, and the deputy commissioner of police, Wilfred Akao, who joined the rebels' drive to oust Mr Ulufa'alu. Tensions have been high on the main island of Guadalcanal for nearly two years as islanders feud over land rights. Indigenous residents have been using force and intimidation to expel thousands of migrants from the neighbouring island of Malaita. Angry they have not been compensated for lost land and homes, Malaitans raided an armoury and took over the capital last week, demanding a change in government. Many of the indigenous residents retreated to the countryside, where they own most of the land. An unwritten ceasefire expires next week. On Wednesday, the prime minister resigned and announced that a committee made up of government and opposition leaders would try to arrange peace talks. Mr Ulufa'alu said he hoped a deal could be reached within two weeks, allowing parliament to elect a new leader.",

In a column on page 24, June 10, we referred to the missing husband of Jane Noble as Dr Matthew Noble. He is, in fact, Dr Matthew Choyce. Apologies. In a review of Venecia at the Gate Theatre, London, page 25, June 8, we attributed the production to Alison Gordon. She is the translator and co-writer. The director and co-writer is Rebecca Gatward. Apologies to both. In a feature headed Window Shopping, page 14, Space (a supplement with the Guardian in some areas) we described the material uPVC as unplastered polyvinyl chloride. That should be \"unplasticised\" etc. In our piece about Channel crossings, page 2, Travel, June 10, we said that P&amp;O had Conran restaurants. We should have said Langan's restaurants. In a note on page 11, Saturday Review, June 10, we gave details of the Barry MacSweeney memorial readings but got the date wrong. They are, in fact, today: 2pm Hatton Gallery, Newcastle University; 8pm Mordern Tower, West Walls, Newcastle upon Tyne.

His sense of the sacred derives from places that are often quite humble, and which are not merely visited but lived in. Perhaps no other 20th-century poet has written so well, and so extensively, on his own family life.</p> <p>Bertolucci was born near San Lazzaro di Parma. \"I am,\" he has said, \"the son of an agrarian middle-class family,\" his father coming from impoverished stock in the mountains, his mother from the rich middle-class of the valley of the lower Po. Parma itself offered a rooted continuity for his early years and, even after marriage, he continued to live in the parental house with his wife, Ninetta Giovanardi, and their first-born son, Bernardo, who began as a poet but was to become a film director under the tutelage of Pier Paulo Pasolini.</p> <p>Bertolucci enrolled as a law student for a number of years, though without attending classes or taking any exams, then transferred to the study of art history, under Roberto Longhi at the University of Bologna. This subject he was to go on to teach at the Maria Luigia boarding school in Parma.</p> <p>Parma also saw his debut as book reviewer, and theatre and film critic for La Gazzetta. Here, in the 1930s, he absorbed his anti-fascism from other Parmensi intellectuals. As foreign editor for the poetry publisher, Guanda, he was responsible for the La Fenice series, which introduced a wide range of overseas modern poetry to Italy.</p> <p>As a poet, Bertolucci was an early beginner, his first book, Serio (Sirius), appearing in 1929, when he was 18. One poem here, Vento (Wind), was written three years earlier. After describing the aggression of the wind, the poem ends: \". . . weary, it falls asleep and a stupor/ Takes all things, as after making love.\" His older friends asked him what he, a 15-year-old could know about l'amore. \"I could only blush in answer,\" he told me.</p> <p>In 1934, a second volume, Fuochi In Novembre (Fires In November), attracted the attention of Eugenio Montale, always a perceptive reviewer, which helped to extend Bertolucci's reputation.</p> <p>A long gap followed - there are several of these in the poet's career - and not until 1951 did Lettera Da Casa (Letter From Home) appear. This was a traumatic year for Bertolucci. He moved from the family house to Rome on the insistence of his father, who felt he had \"a calling\" there and gave Attilio and Ninetta the apartment in which they were to pass the rest of their life.</p> <p>In Rome, along with another spell of teaching, Bertolucci worked for the publisher Garzanti, for the third programme of Italian radio and for the daily La Repubblica. He was also involved in various cultural projects for television. There was, by now, a second son, Giuseppe, also destined to become a film director and, if not as famous as his brother, an artist with a discriminating circle of admirers. After two other volumes - La Capanna Indiana (The Indian Wigwam, 1951) and In Un Tempo Incerto (In An Uncertain Time, 1955) - there appeared Viaggio d'Inverno (Winter Journey) in 1971.</p> <p>This was Bertolucci's most stylistically adventurous book to date, its nervously roving syntax setting out for unpredictable destinations, enacting perhaps something of the nervous tensions that were involved in the deracination from Parma and the transfer to the capital.</p> <p>The word ansia (anxiety) echoes time and again throughout the poems. \"How anxiety is born,\" runs the title of one section of a later book. The word was anxiety, not depression, Bertolucci insisted.</p> <p>When this condition became acute, he sought psychiatric aid. When it was alleviated, his psychiatrist refused payment, saying that the poet had cured himself by his own will to recover. That this ansia - for the feared loss of human certainties - should produce poems of such darting energy and loving attachment to the immediate world, is one of their creative fascinations.</p> <p>Bertolucci's character stemmed from an intriguing mixture of timidity and boldness. Something of a malade imaginaire, he feared draughts more than the very real danger of being taken before the German authorities in 1944. When his house at Casarola was robbed, he responded with, \"It could have been worse. Imagine if one had contracted pleurisy.\"</p> <p>His friend, another great Italian poet, Vittorio Sereni, called him \"a divine egoist\", but the self-absorption was easily breached by his generosity to younger poets and by the sheer absorption in the flow of life which fills his poems.</p> <p>Much of Bertolucci's subject matter - his family and his own childhood - remains constant. But now, in Viaggio d'Inverno, there is an amplitude behind the fears, and also the joys, of daily life nourished from deep within, and a force that is unwilling to brook stanzaic gaps, dispensing with punctuation and flowing forward like some sinuous river as it breaks out of the quatrains to make one final or provisional statement, as in I Papaveri (Poppies):</p> <p>Half-way through my life, I'd seen</p> <p>grown sons go off into their own</p> <p>world, lost to sight beyond the cage in flights</p> <p>which the swallows weave across the spent</p> <p>glare of a stormy evening</p> <p>and as is natural, my sorrow subsided</p> <p>in the light of the house re-kindled</p> <p>for another meal in an atmosphere freshened now</p> <p>by a scattering of hailstones in the distance.</p> <p>One sees from the form of a poem like I Papaveri why Bertolucci relished the advice Jean Renoir gave to his son Bernardo: \"Remember always to leave the camera running, because things may enter it that you would never have imagined.\"</p> <p>From the 1960s, Bertolucci tended to alternate between places of residence - the apartment in Rome during winter, an ancestral 17th-century house in the Apennine village of Casarola for spring and summer, and a pied-\u00e0-terre for autumn by the sea, in the Ligurian village of Tellaro. Tellaro is near to Lerici, where he was to become president of the committee for the Lerici prize and the biennial literary conference there. In 1991, he was made an honorary citizen of the town. The growing number of literary prizes attested the extent of his recognition throughout Italy.</p> <p>It was at Tellaro that Bertolucci wrote large portions of his most ambitious work so far, a novel in verse, La Camera Da Letto (The Bedroom), published in 1984 and 1988, in which his parents' generation, his childhood (returned to after reading and translating Wordsworth), and his love for Ninetta are all celebrated. This exploration of a personal world reached out to a far wider audience than he had known previously, and the book became a great literary success - \"an unpleasant word,\" Bertolucci was quick to add.</p> <p>The appearance in 1994 of Imitazioni (Imitations), a book of verse translations, is a measure of Bertolucci's love of English literature: Milton, Wordsworth, Landor, Thomas Hardy and Edward Thomas are all here, beside a handful of Americans, including Ezra Pound, TS Eliot and Marianne Moore. Bertolucci accounted Proust \"the most important writer of the 20th century\". One might almost feel that Hardy and Proust are present in equal quantities in his often retrospective poems \u00e0 la recherche du temps perdu, and there are moments when Edward Thomas seems close at hand.</p> <p>These are, of course, intensely Italian poems, but Italian that has felt these other currents of language and sensibility. A life of translating both prose - Katherine Mansfield, DH Lawrence and Ernest Hemingway - and verse has shown Italian new possibilities in Bertolucci's work. \"Translation,\" he said in All'improviso Ricordando (Unexpectedly Remembering, 1997) \"is always an admirable exercise, which poets must do in the same spirit as painters, at times, copy their great predecessors.\"</p> <p>The 1990s saw two other volumes of verse. The first of these, Verso Le Sorgenti Del Cinghio (Towards The Sources Of The Cinghio, 1993), consists in part of \"lost\" poems, refound in an old shoe box when Bertolucci was looking for materials to help Paolo Lagazzi, the most perceptive of Bertolucci scholars, in his researches.</p> <p>In 1971, with the publication of Viaggio d'Inverno, Bertolucci thought himself at the end of his phase of lyrical poetry, as he turned more and more to the completion of the novel in verse. But Verso Le Sorgenti bears witness to the way in which a poet's conscious sense of where he is at can be confuted by the arrival of messages from unlooked-for sources, as the title of the book suggests. Four years later, La Lucertola Di Casarola (The Lizard Of Casarola, 1997) shows Bertolucci's lyric vein far from exhausted, and brings to light yet more mislaid or set-aside poems.</p> <p>The rich fecundity of Bertolucci's work - both before and after the verse novel - provides an exceptional chapter in the history of 20th-century Italian poetry.</p> <p>He is survived by Ninetta and their two film-director sons.</p> <p>Attilio Bertolucci, poet, born November 18, 1911; died June 14 2000</p> <p>The poet Charles Tomlinson is the translator of Bertolucci's Selected Poems, published by Bloodaxe Books (1993)</p>",

In 1971, with the publication of Viaggio d'Inverno, Bertolucci thought himself at the end of his phase of lyrical poetry, as he turned more and more to the completion of the novel in verse. But Verso Le Sorgenti bears witness to the way in which a poet's conscious sense of where he is at can be confuted by the arrival of messages from unlooked-for sources, as the title of the book suggests. Four years later, La Lucertola Di Casarola (The Lizard Of Casarola, 1997) shows Bertolucci's lyric vein far from exhausted, and brings to light yet more mislaid or set-aside poems. The rich fecundity of Bertolucci's work - both before and after the verse novel - provides an exceptional chapter in the history of 20th-century Italian poetry. He is survived by Ninetta and their two film-director sons. Attilio Bertolucci, poet, born November 18, 1911; died June 14 2000 The poet Charles Tomlinson is the translator of Bertolucci's Selected Poems, published by Bloodaxe Books (1993)",

But beware. Eddie Izzard, whose instinct for duff films is as unerring as his ability to make us laugh without a script, plays the leader of the Disco Boys. The mystery here is how so much talent got involved in this lame little comedy. Mystery Men is about a collection of superhero wannabes who don't have any superpowers but have to prove themselves by rescuing Captain Amazing from ace villain Casanova Frankenstein. It sounds like the plot for a three-minute Whose Line Is It Anyway sketch, especially when Invisible Boy (only invisible when no one's looking) appears. Based on a Dark Horse comic, this turns out to be a bit of a dead donkey.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>'I gained a new freedom,\" says 49-year-old film-maker Zhang Yimou. He speaks softly, but with a deep voice. He is referring to the termination of his professional and personal relationship with Gong Li, China's best-known actress, with whom he collaborated in his first six films - from the 1988 Red Sorghum through to 1995's Shanghai Triad. During the production of the latter, Gong Li reportedly terminated the relationship, and, within one year, married a wealthy Singaporean businessman. Film-maker and performer have not collaborated since. </p> <p>\"Gong Li and I were together for eight years,\" he says. \"Right after our very first film she became a movie star. We became a star combination. I was always thinking about the actress. Whenever I had an idea, I would wonder, 'Can she do it? Would it be good for her? Would we fight?' Working with her implied a certain shape of the film. </p> <p>\"Almost all of her parts were larger-than-life women, symbols living under the oppression of feudalism and patriarchy,\" he continues. \"They were characters close to life, but not close to everyday people. The one closest to real life is her title role in The Story of Qiu Jiu [1992], which, I think, is her best performance. After Gong Li, I wanted to do something different. Sometimes you miss what you have not been eating. I decided to make films about little people: ordinary, common people.\" </p> <p>Hence his decision to test new waters in the urban comedy Keep Cool (made 1996, but never released in the UK) and the rural drama Not One Less, which opens here next Friday, after taking the Golden Lion for best film at last year's Venice film festival. Money, or more precisely lack of it, is the prism through which he examines the lives of the \"little people\". </p> <p>Keep Cool, which he shot with a maniacal handheld camera, and Not One Less can be seen as experiments for Zhang. After losing Gong Li, he began to search for new cinematic possibilities. He had also begun to tire of his recurring problems with the Chinese government over historical and political references in his films. (The authorities have always held against him the fact that his late father had studied at a pre-communist military academy, and that his father's brother was a general who fought against the communists and fled to Taiwan.)</p> <p>His more recent subjects - money, its lack, its devastating effect on society - are humanistic, less political than in the earlier work. Keep Cool, for example, features underworld figures and a bookworm who pines for a woman interested only in a wealthy man. Wang Wei, who produced both Keep Cool and Shanghai Triad, adds: \"Yimou wants to show that, with everybody in China making money, relationships between people are changing.\" </p> <p>Zhang goes further in Not One Less. He takes on the enormous problem of under-financed education, especially in the desperately poor villages that do not possess the resources to adequately maintain and supply their tumble-down schools. Many of the young students drop out in order to work at the family home or in a nearby city, often on their own. </p> <p>\"Chinese people are not concerned with their kids not getting an education, because they are too busy pursuing material goods,\" says Zhang. \"At the end of the film, during the final credits, the kids each write one word after another on the blackboard. It calls attention to the beauty of learning when we were kids. It also calls attention to the fact that we pay little attention to culture.\" </p> <p>In Not One Less, Zhang cast all non-professionals to play out this drama in the village of Shuiquan, a three-and-a-half hour drive north of Beijing in the impoverished province of Hebei. The kids portray characters much like themselves, and even use their own names. His team looked at thousands of youngsters before casting Wei Minzhi as the underqualified, 13-year-old substitute teacher, and Zhang Huike as her most troublesome, and most endearing, student. Zhang felt that a near-documentary style, occasionally utilising hidden cameras, would best serve his subject, much as it had done in The Story of Qiu Jiu seven years earlier. </p> <p>In Qiu Jiu, the title character - Gong Li - is a peasant who demands an apology from the village mayor for injuring her husband \"where it counts\", as she puts it. Obstinate as a mule, Qiu Jiu refuses to take no for an answer, even venturing to the city, where she becomes lost among the masses, to lodge a complaint with functionaries at the Public Security Bureau. </p> <p>The stubbornness of Wei Minzhi, who can barely read and write herself, outweighs even Qiu Jiu's. Her main concern is to keep the class intact, for she has been assured a bonus upon the regular teacher's return only if there is \"not one less\" pupil in the class than when he departed. After Zhang Huike's invalid mother sends him to the city of Jiangjiakou to help pay off the family's debts, Wei Minzhi refuses to mind her flock and heads instead to town to find the boy.</p> <p>She hunts for him blindly, while he begs in the streets. Teacher and student eventually meet up through a deus ex machina in the form of an afternoon TV programme that mildly exploits their separation, even collecting on-air contributions to improve the village school and Zhang Huike's family situation. </p> <p>This relatively \"happy\" ending has brewed controversy, both within and outside of China. \"You always have to take censors into account in China,\" explains Zhang. \"I wouldn't have been able to make a story in which the child wasn't found.\" </p> <p>\"The Chinese critics wrote that the film was a shehui gongyepian , a public service announcement, propaganda like those big ads that tell you how to behave in the street,\" says Marco Muller, director of the Locarno film festival and a long-time champion of Chinese cinema. Another Chinese film scholar, Alberto Barbera, director of the Venice film festival, offers a more generous appraisal. \"The end of the film can be seen as a surrender to the purposes of propaganda, but what comes before it is a strong denunciation of a regime that is unable to assure proper education for country children and better life conditions in the remote peasant villages.\" </p> <p>Liu Lening, another Chinese film scholar who teaches linguistics at Columbia University and is a close friend of Zhang's, defends the film's ending. \"It's not a propaganda movie at all,\" he says. \"Yimou is genuinely concerned with children's education in rural areas. Both of us were born in a big city, Xian, but we were both sent to the countryside during the Cultural Revolution to do hard labour. He knows country life pretty well.\" </p> <p>Liu does agree that the film could not have been made with worse things happening to the boy in the city. \"Censorship is certainly a factor,\" he says. </p> <p>Zhang admits that Not One Less has been heavily influenced by the work of Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami, whose pared-down rural films about children he admires. (As a secondary benefit, these children's films have enabled Kiarostami to generally bypass a censorship machine tougher than China's.) \"Kiarostami's films are very elementary. Simplicity is extremely difficult to achieve, especially when society today has become more complex. I've tried to follow a Chinese proverb: go back to simplicity.\" </p> <p>Is this imitation or reinvention? \"Yimou has produced Kiarostami-Lite that can work on the international market,\" charges Muller. \"He will slowly transform the auteur films of people like Kiarostami into obsolete art.\" </p> <p>Perhaps. \"Yimou has always been pretty savvy about the need to market a film,\" says Barbara Robinson, the Hong Kong-based managing director of Columbia Pictures Film Production Asia, which bought the rights to sell Not One Less and The Road Home in foreign markets. \"For him, it's always more than, 'This is my art, love it or loathe it.' \" </p> <p>Gong Li agrees. \"The most important and passionate thing in his life is his work. But I don't think Zhang Yimou's films are just artistic,\" she says. \"For him, the market is also an important element - as you can see in both Not One Less and The Road Home. These films have a certain commercial intention to them.\" </p> <p>Zhang, who says he has no plans to shoot outside of China, has become increasingly astute about the finances of production and distribution. He has to. Some of his fellow Fifth Generation filmmakers (fellow 1982 graduates of the Beijing film academy after its reopening), like Tian Zhuangzhuang, director of The Horse Thief and The Blue Kite, have stopped making films, oblivious to new possibilities of financing. And Zhang sees himself as something of an anthropologist.</p> <p>\"There are so many Hollywood films around that you have to do what you can to be able to preserve Chinese culture and experience on film,\" he says. He shot Shanghai Triad with French money. He is currently negotiating with an American producer to provide dollars for a future project to be shot in China. And, depending on whom you talk to, American money played a big part in getting both Not One Less and The Road Home, each shot for a meagre $1m, off the ground - even though a company called Beijing New Picture Distribution Company takes credit for financing the films completely with money from private Chinese investors. </p> <p>Following the experiments of Keep Cool and Not One Less, Zhang completed The Road Home, a romantic, lyrical, and much more conventional film which won the Silver Bear at this year's Berlin film festival. It features an attractive, 20-year-old actress named Zhang Ziyi, who plays a beautiful, illiterate village girl enamoured of the new village schoolteacher. Zhang's camera frequently - very frequently - lingers on her, often in slow motion. Like Red Sorghum, his first collaboration with Gong Li, The Road Home tells a passionate tale of courtship. </p> <p>\"It's possible that Ziyi can become another Gong Li,\" says Zhang, carefully avoiding any mention of their personal relationship. \"I selected both of them in their second year at the Beijing Drama Academy. It's like a repeat 10 years later. When I started working with Gong Li, she was 22. When I started with Ziyi, she was not yet 19. I am the one who discovered her and groomed her.\" He says he plans to work with her again, but makes it clear that she can be no more than a part-time muse. Once bitten, twice shy. He laughs. \"I don't think I can repeat what I did with Gong Li.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Not One Less is released next Friday.</p>",

During the production of the latter, Gong Li reportedly terminated the relationship, and, within one year, married a wealthy Singaporean businessman. Film-maker and performer have not collaborated since. \"Gong Li and I were together for eight years,\" he says. \"Right after our very first film she became a movie star. We became a star combination. I was always thinking about the actress. Whenever I had an idea, I would wonder, 'Can she do it? Would it be good for her? Would we fight?' Working with her implied a certain shape of the film. \"Almost all of her parts were larger-than-life women, symbols living under the oppression of feudalism and patriarchy,\" he continues. \"They were characters close to life, but not close to everyday people. The one closest to real life is her title role in The Story of Qiu Jiu [1992], which, I think, is her best performance. After Gong Li, I wanted to do something different. Sometimes you miss what you have not been eating. I decided to make films about little people: ordinary, common people.\" Hence his decision to test new waters in the urban comedy Keep Cool (made 1996, but never released in the UK) and the rural drama Not One Less, which opens here next Friday, after taking the Golden Lion for best film at last year's Venice film festival. Money, or more precisely lack of it, is the prism through which he examines the lives of the \"little people\". Keep Cool, which he shot with a maniacal handheld camera, and Not One Less can be seen as experiments for Zhang. After losing Gong Li, he began to search for new cinematic possibilities. He had also begun to tire of his recurring problems with the Chinese government over historical and political references in his films. (The authorities have always held against him the fact that his late father had studied at a pre-communist military academy, and that his father's brother was a general who fought against the communists and fled to Taiwan.) His more recent subjects - money, its lack, its devastating effect on society - are humanistic, less political than in the earlier work. Keep Cool, for example, features underworld figures and a bookworm who pines for a woman interested only in a wealthy man. Wang Wei, who produced both Keep Cool and Shanghai Triad, adds: \"Yimou wants to show that, with everybody in China making money, relationships between people are changing.\" Zhang goes further in Not One Less. He takes on the enormous problem of under-financed education, especially in the desperately poor villages that do not possess the resources to adequately maintain and supply their tumble-down schools. Many of the young students drop out in order to work at the family home or in a nearby city, often on their own. \"Chinese people are not concerned with their kids not getting an education, because they are too busy pursuing material goods,\" says Zhang. \"At the end of the film, during the final credits, the kids each write one word after another on the blackboard. It calls attention to the beauty of learning when we were kids. It also calls attention to the fact that we pay little attention to culture.\" In Not One Less, Zhang cast all non-professionals to play out this drama in the village of Shuiquan, a three-and-a-half hour drive north of Beijing in the impoverished province of Hebei. The kids portray characters much like themselves, and even use their own names. His team looked at thousands of youngsters before casting Wei Minzhi as the underqualified, 13-year-old substitute teacher, and Zhang Huike as her most troublesome, and most endearing, student. Zhang felt that a near-documentary style, occasionally utilising hidden cameras, would best serve his subject, much as it had done in The Story of Qiu Jiu seven years earlier. In Qiu Jiu, the title character - Gong Li - is a peasant who demands an apology from the village mayor for injuring her husband \"where it counts\", as she puts it. Obstinate as a mule, Qiu Jiu refuses to take no for an answer, even venturing to the city, where she becomes lost among the masses, to lodge a complaint with functionaries at the Public Security Bureau. The stubbornness of Wei Minzhi, who can barely read and write herself, outweighs even Qiu Jiu's. Her main concern is to keep the class intact, for she has been assured a bonus upon the regular teacher's return only if there is \"not one less\" pupil in the class than when he departed. After Zhang Huike's invalid mother sends him to the city of Jiangjiakou to help pay off the family's debts, Wei Minzhi refuses to mind her flock and heads instead to town to find the boy. She hunts for him blindly, while he begs in the streets. Teacher and student eventually meet up through a deus ex machina in the form of an afternoon TV programme that mildly exploits their separation, even collecting on-air contributions to improve the village school and Zhang Huike's family situation. This relatively \"happy\" ending has brewed controversy, both within and outside of China. \"You always have to take censors into account in China,\" explains Zhang. \"I wouldn't have been able to make a story in which the child wasn't found.\" \"The Chinese critics wrote that the film was a shehui gongyepian , a public service announcement, propaganda like those big ads that tell you how to behave in the street,\" says Marco Muller, director of the Locarno film festival and a long-time champion of Chinese cinema. Another Chinese film scholar, Alberto Barbera, director of the Venice film festival, offers a more generous appraisal. \"The end of the film can be seen as a surrender to the purposes of propaganda, but what comes before it is a strong denunciation of a regime that is unable to assure proper education for country children and better life conditions in the remote peasant villages.\" Liu Lening, another Chinese film scholar who teaches linguistics at Columbia University and is a close friend of Zhang's, defends the film's ending. \"It's not a propaganda movie at all,\" he says. \"Yimou is genuinely concerned with children's education in rural areas. Both of us were born in a big city, Xian, but we were both sent to the countryside during the Cultural Revolution to do hard labour. He knows country life pretty well.\" Liu does agree that the film could not have been made with worse things happening to the boy in the city. \"Censorship is certainly a factor,\" he says. Zhang admits that Not One Less has been heavily influenced by the work of Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami, whose pared-down rural films about children he admires. (As a secondary benefit, these children's films have enabled Kiarostami to generally bypass a censorship machine tougher than China's.) \"Kiarostami's films are very elementary. Simplicity is extremely difficult to achieve, especially when society today has become more complex. I've tried to follow a Chinese proverb: go back to simplicity.\" Is this imitation or reinvention? \"Yimou has produced Kiarostami-Lite that can work on the international market,\" charges Muller. \"He will slowly transform the auteur films of people like Kiarostami into obsolete art.\" Perhaps. \"Yimou has always been pretty savvy about the need to market a film,\" says Barbara Robinson, the Hong Kong-based managing director of Columbia Pictures Film Production Asia, which bought the rights to sell Not One Less and The Road Home in foreign markets. \"For him, it's always more than, 'This is my art, love it or loathe it.' \" Gong Li agrees. \"The most important and passionate thing in his life is his work. But I don't think Zhang Yimou's films are just artistic,\" she says. \"For him, the market is also an important element - as you can see in both Not One Less and The Road Home. These films have a certain commercial intention to them.\" Zhang, who says he has no plans to shoot outside of China, has become increasingly astute about the finances of production and distribution. He has to. Some of his fellow Fifth Generation filmmakers (fellow 1982 graduates of the Beijing film academy after its reopening), like Tian Zhuangzhuang, director of The Horse Thief and The Blue Kite, have stopped making films, oblivious to new possibilities of financing. And Zhang sees himself as something of an anthropologist. \"There are so many Hollywood films around that you have to do what you can to be able to preserve Chinese culture and experience on film,\" he says. He shot Shanghai Triad with French money. He is currently negotiating with an American producer to provide dollars for a future project to be shot in China. And, depending on whom you talk to, American money played a big part in getting both Not One Less and The Road Home, each shot for a meagre $1m, off the ground - even though a company called Beijing New Picture Distribution Company takes credit for financing the films completely with money from private Chinese investors. Following the experiments of Keep Cool and Not One Less, Zhang completed The Road Home, a romantic, lyrical, and much more conventional film which won the Silver Bear at this year's Berlin film festival. It features an attractive, 20-year-old actress named Zhang Ziyi, who plays a beautiful, illiterate village girl enamoured of the new village schoolteacher. Zhang's camera frequently - very frequently - lingers on her, often in slow motion. Like Red Sorghum, his first collaboration with Gong Li, The Road Home tells a passionate tale of courtship. \"It's possible that Ziyi can become another Gong Li,\" says Zhang, carefully avoiding any mention of their personal relationship. \"I selected both of them in their second year at the Beijing Drama Academy. It's like a repeat 10 years later. When I started working with Gong Li, she was 22. When I started with Ziyi, she was not yet 19. I am the one who discovered her and groomed her.\" He says he plans to work with her again, but makes it clear that she can be no more than a part-time muse. Once bitten, twice shy. He laughs. \"I don't think I can repeat what I did with Gong Li.\" \u0095 Not One Less is released next Friday.",

      "body": "<p>\"It just started off troubled and stayed that way,\" is how William Malone recalls Supernova, the $60m sci-fi thriller from MGM that opens in the UK today. With five screenwriters (three credited, including Malone himself) and five directors (none credited), numerous potential lawsuits and a production history more mysterious and intriguing than anything in the film, Supernova may represent the most troubled project in recent history. </p> <p>The film's credited director is Thomas Lee, a name coined as the 21st-century equivalent of the imaginary Alan Smithee. The credit really belongs to Walter Hill, co-producer of the first three Alien films, and director of 48 Hours and Last Man Standing. But Hill jumped ship after rows with studio bosses last summer, and after two more directors (including Francis Ford Coppola) came aboard, it was decided to give it to the non-existent Lee. This is his first film - but it will almost certainly not be his last. </p> <p>Despite Malone's claim that Supernova \"started off troubled\", its conception was far less painful than its birth. In 1990, the film - then called Dead Star - was pitched to studios as a modestly-budgeted futuristic rescue movie from the team behind Malone's 1985 film Titan Find (US title: Creature). \"I had this idea to take the movie Dead Calm and make it a science fiction picture,\" Malone explains. The original script was about a space expedition \"that discovers artefacts from an alien civilisation, and is going to bring them back when a whole bunch of things happen. One of the things they pick up is a portal to death, which is a place you can actually go to, and out of that comes the devil.\" </p> <p>Malone and Ash R Shah, the producer of Sudden Death, asked Alien conceptual artist HR Giger to produce a series of pre-production sketches to encourage financing for a film that was then budgeted to cost between $5m and $6m. As Giger notes, Malone \"had written the story himself, a sort of Hellraiser in space... He had already done some designs for it but he left the actual Prince of Darkness of the Cosmos to me.\" </p> <p>Malone says that Giger \"came up with some brilliant sketches. I spent 10 days working with him in Switzerland.\" Giger was paid 10,000 Swiss francs for his concepts and heard nothing more until 1995, when the sketches turned up in a promotional booklet for the film. It was now called Supernova and, according to Giger, suggested \"a much simplified version of the script that had attracted me to the project\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, says Malone, \"there was a lot of heat about the script, but nobody would step up to the plate and make it. After that, I lost track of it, until I heard that MGM had bought it. They brought in a lot of other writers to work on the picture.\" Those were credited co-screenwriters David Campbell Wilson (Tomorrow Never Dies) and Daniel Chuba, and uncredited contributors Cathy Rabin and Thomas Wheeler. \"Then it sort of mutated into something else. What it is now, I don't have a clue.\" </p> <p>Indeed, by 1997, when pre-production was announced, Supernova had mutated into the story of a deep space medical ship, the Nova, which answers a distress signal from a comet-mining operation in a distant galaxy. Using its unique two-dimensional drive to fold space, the ship appears on the other side of the universe, where the crew finds the hulk of an ageing cargo vessel, about to be sucked into a black hole formed by the collapse of a star. The sole survivor of the sinking ship, Anton Mason, comes aboard the Nova with a terrifying story about what transpired on the vessel. </p> <p>Since then, the story has seen as many changes as the name on the director's chair. Australian director Geoffrey Wright, who launched Russell Crowe's career in Romper Stomper, was fired by MGM over a script dispute. Jack Sholder (The Hidden) was next up, until the studio, encouraged by Stargate star James Spader, who was cast in the lead role, passed in favour of Walter Hill. </p> <p>With only weeks to go until a threatened strike by the Screen Actors Guild, which would shut down production, Hill began tinkering with the script, apparently trying to distance it from his own earlier production, Alien. Production finally commenced in April 1998, with Angela Bassett (What's Love Got to Do With It), Robert Forster (Jackie Brown) and Robin Tunney (End of Days) joining Spader, and The Fifth Element's visual effects supervisor Mark Stetson overseeing special effects at Digital Domain. </p> <p>MGM, however, continued to balk at the number of effects shots Hill requested, and cut out fully half of them. Out went a complex sequence in which Spader performs a nail-biting zero-gravity rescue inside a giant bubble of water. Out too, went a sophisticated, remotely-operated medical robot in favour of a shuffling humanoid android described by one critic as \"a cross between Kryten in Red Dwarf and Woody Allen in Sleeper.\" </p> <p>Finally, out went Walter Hill, who quit shortly after principal photography was completed. David Campbell Wilson later commented: \"Walter's vision for the film was different from the studio's. It's a shame that couldn't be resolved during production.\" </p> <p>A disastrous test screening followed Hill's departure. MGM called Sholder back to re-edit Hill's footage, tested the film again, and then met Hill to discuss his proposal for $5m worth of re-shoots. Unwilling to throw good money after bad, the studio refused, and Hill walked out again. </p> <p>One by one, potential release dates disappeared into a black hole, until MGM board member Francis Ford Coppola intervened, effecting a $1m re-edit. \"I hope that my experience in the film industry has helped improve the picture and rectified some of the problems that losing a director caused,\" he said in a statement. In the event, Coppola's cut did not test any better than Sholder's; neither did it secure the hoped-for PG-13 rating, and the film was re-cut yet again. </p> <p>Finally, with no pre-release screenings and little publicity (even the press materials feature only two direct quotations, both from chief science consultant Dr Jacklyn R Green), Supernova was released in the US on January 17, almost two years later than planned. </p> <p>Opening with a dismal $6.7m, the film went on to gross just $14m - barely a quarter of its cost. The critics were similarly unimpressed, with one describing it as \"a frustrating jumble of logic leaps, impenetrable technobabble, rote action, and not one distinctive F/X piece.\" </p> <p>This latter remark was particularly surprising, given that journalists at a Digital Domain press junket in February 1999 were shown almost 40 minutes of what one viewer describes as \"absolutely cutting edge, moving-camera effects shots\". </p> <p>With the credited director as imaginary as the premise of the film, and Walter Hill's silence guaranteed as part of his severance deal with MGM, the full story behind Supernova is unlikely to emerge any time soon. But with the film now opening in the UK, British audiences will at last be able to make up their own minds whether or not it was worth the trouble.</p> <p>\u0095 Supernova is released today.</p>",

With five screenwriters (three credited, including Malone himself) and five directors (none credited), numerous potential lawsuits and a production history more mysterious and intriguing than anything in the film, Supernova may represent the most troubled project in recent history. The film's credited director is Thomas Lee, a name coined as the 21st-century equivalent of the imaginary Alan Smithee. The credit really belongs to Walter Hill, co-producer of the first three Alien films, and director of 48 Hours and Last Man Standing. But Hill jumped ship after rows with studio bosses last summer, and after two more directors (including Francis Ford Coppola) came aboard, it was decided to give it to the non-existent Lee. This is his first film - but it will almost certainly not be his last. Despite Malone's claim that Supernova \"started off troubled\", its conception was far less painful than its birth. In 1990, the film - then called Dead Star - was pitched to studios as a modestly-budgeted futuristic rescue movie from the team behind Malone's 1985 film Titan Find (US title: Creature). \"I had this idea to take the movie Dead Calm and make it a science fiction picture,\" Malone explains. The original script was about a space expedition \"that discovers artefacts from an alien civilisation, and is going to bring them back when a whole bunch of things happen. One of the things they pick up is a portal to death, which is a place you can actually go to, and out of that comes the devil.\" Malone and Ash R Shah, the producer of Sudden Death, asked Alien conceptual artist HR Giger to produce a series of pre-production sketches to encourage financing for a film that was then budgeted to cost between $5m and $6m. As Giger notes, Malone \"had written the story himself, a sort of Hellraiser in space... He had already done some designs for it but he left the actual Prince of Darkness of the Cosmos to me.\" Malone says that Giger \"came up with some brilliant sketches. I spent 10 days working with him in Switzerland.\" Giger was paid 10,000 Swiss francs for his concepts and heard nothing more until 1995, when the sketches turned up in a promotional booklet for the film. It was now called Supernova and, according to Giger, suggested \"a much simplified version of the script that had attracted me to the project\" Nevertheless, says Malone, \"there was a lot of heat about the script, but nobody would step up to the plate and make it. After that, I lost track of it, until I heard that MGM had bought it. They brought in a lot of other writers to work on the picture.\" Those were credited co-screenwriters David Campbell Wilson (Tomorrow Never Dies) and Daniel Chuba, and uncredited contributors Cathy Rabin and Thomas Wheeler. \"Then it sort of mutated into something else. What it is now, I don't have a clue.\" Indeed, by 1997, when pre-production was announced, Supernova had mutated into the story of a deep space medical ship, the Nova, which answers a distress signal from a comet-mining operation in a distant galaxy. Using its unique two-dimensional drive to fold space, the ship appears on the other side of the universe, where the crew finds the hulk of an ageing cargo vessel, about to be sucked into a black hole formed by the collapse of a star. The sole survivor of the sinking ship, Anton Mason, comes aboard the Nova with a terrifying story about what transpired on the vessel. Since then, the story has seen as many changes as the name on the director's chair. Australian director Geoffrey Wright, who launched Russell Crowe's career in Romper Stomper, was fired by MGM over a script dispute. Jack Sholder (The Hidden) was next up, until the studio, encouraged by Stargate star James Spader, who was cast in the lead role, passed in favour of Walter Hill. With only weeks to go until a threatened strike by the Screen Actors Guild, which would shut down production, Hill began tinkering with the script, apparently trying to distance it from his own earlier production, Alien. Production finally commenced in April 1998, with Angela Bassett (What's Love Got to Do With It), Robert Forster (Jackie Brown) and Robin Tunney (End of Days) joining Spader, and The Fifth Element's visual effects supervisor Mark Stetson overseeing special effects at Digital Domain. MGM, however, continued to balk at the number of effects shots Hill requested, and cut out fully half of them. Out went a complex sequence in which Spader performs a nail-biting zero-gravity rescue inside a giant bubble of water. Out too, went a sophisticated, remotely-operated medical robot in favour of a shuffling humanoid android described by one critic as \"a cross between Kryten in Red Dwarf and Woody Allen in Sleeper.\" Finally, out went Walter Hill, who quit shortly after principal photography was completed. David Campbell Wilson later commented: \"Walter's vision for the film was different from the studio's. It's a shame that couldn't be resolved during production.\" A disastrous test screening followed Hill's departure. MGM called Sholder back to re-edit Hill's footage, tested the film again, and then met Hill to discuss his proposal for $5m worth of re-shoots. Unwilling to throw good money after bad, the studio refused, and Hill walked out again. One by one, potential release dates disappeared into a black hole, until MGM board member Francis Ford Coppola intervened, effecting a $1m re-edit. \"I hope that my experience in the film industry has helped improve the picture and rectified some of the problems that losing a director caused,\" he said in a statement. In the event, Coppola's cut did not test any better than Sholder's; neither did it secure the hoped-for PG-13 rating, and the film was re-cut yet again. Finally, with no pre-release screenings and little publicity (even the press materials feature only two direct quotations, both from chief science consultant Dr Jacklyn R Green), Supernova was released in the US on January 17, almost two years later than planned. Opening with a dismal $6.7m, the film went on to gross just $14m - barely a quarter of its cost. The critics were similarly unimpressed, with one describing it as \"a frustrating jumble of logic leaps, impenetrable technobabble, rote action, and not one distinctive F/X piece.\" This latter remark was particularly surprising, given that journalists at a Digital Domain press junket in February 1999 were shown almost 40 minutes of what one viewer describes as \"absolutely cutting edge, moving-camera effects shots\". With the credited director as imaginary as the premise of the film, and Walter Hill's silence guaranteed as part of his severance deal with MGM, the full story behind Supernova is unlikely to emerge any time soon. But with the film now opening in the UK, British audiences will at last be able to make up their own minds whether or not it was worth the trouble. \u0095 Supernova is released today.",

      "body": "<p>In Beyond the Mat, Barry W Blaustein's extraordinary documentary about American wrestling (and hence America), there is one abiding image. Not blood fountaining on to canvas, nor fat white-trash men throwing beer cans at a wrestler lying face down in leather trunks, but a businessman called Vince McMahon in a revolving chair. </p> <p>McMahon is owner of the World Wrestling Federation. At the beginning of the film, he's seen making billion-dollar deals and sipping mineral water. By the end, he has become a wrestler: one of the weirdest, and yet most inevitable, of transformations one is likely to see on a movie screen. Stranger than fiction. </p> <p>McMahon's desire to put himself centre-stage is an attractive image for Blaustein, not least because it tells an in-joke. McMahon is an unwitting parody of the documentary film-maker as genial participant in his own work: he plays the boring business game, doing suity deals, and really all he wants to do is rip his shirt off and clown about in front of 20m people. </p> <p>McMahon's bizarre, laughable, yet completely sincere career change is a lesson for the modern documentary film-maker, an indication of how far such directors have had to travel from their politically committed antecedents. </p> <p>Blaustein fits the profile of the archetypal contemporary documentary-maker - to perfection. A balding fortysomething white man, wrestling - if you will - with an obsession. His film, like all documentaries of this kind, begins with a shot of a balding, fortysomething guy (guess who?) watching TV clips (the obsession, dramatised in its simplest form). A voice-over begins. \"Since I was a child, I've been fascinated by wrestling/serial killers/budgerigars. I needed to get to the heart of my obsession, nail it once and for all.\" </p> <p>Cue two hours of bald, fortysomething guy driving in hire-car, interviewing various white-trash lunatics, reaching moment of profound pathos, possibly intercut with poignant shots of own family, coming to suitably flippant but deep conclusion about obsession. Blaustein concludes that wrestlers are \"just the same as us. Except they're totally different.\" </p> <p>Don't get me wrong. I loved the film - in spite of, not because of, the convention it follows. It's simply that the style has become overused, like Nick Broomfield's furry boom microphone and billowing shirt. </p> <p>The bald-guy-obsession convention is the one minor cloud occluding a golden era of documentary film-making: Beyond the Mat, Hoop Dreams, When We Were Kings and, just out, Wisconsin Death Trip. These are documentaries that have all surmounted the insurmountable and got a theatrical release. </p> <p>Why is there such an appetite for documentaries on the big screen (beyond the obvious reason that these are very, very good)? It's not as though very, very good docs weren't made in the past. From the late 50s, an underground stream of passionate and polemical films flowed unhindered through select cinemas and film festivals of the world. Politically committed reportage, chronicling war and death and misery, directed by some of the world's greatest directors: Alain Resnais's Night and Fog (a meditation on Auschwitz); Barbara Kopple's Harlan County USA (an examination of a miners' strike in 1976); Peter Davis's anti-Vietnam classic Hearts and Minds; and so on, as far as one cares look. </p> <p>Ironically, many viscera-jogging documentaries from the 60s and 70s now look like ground-breaking feature films. Oleg Astaulav's incredible film Reporting From North Vietnam, for example, was all but remade by Oliver Stone in his post-Nam epic, Heaven and Earth. Here were documentaries shorn of stylistic cool. None involved a central hero. They were downbeat, minimal, sometimes too painfully honest to watch - Reporting From North Vietnam unblinkingly shows a mother in a single four-minute shot, the reality slowly dawning on her that her children have been killed in an Agent Orange attack. It's unbearable and would have driven a generation to torch the US embassy, had they seen it. </p> <p>Many of today's theatrically released documentaries hold on to pieces of the genre's uncompromising art, but are more concerned with borrowing sexy techniques from today's feature films and pop promos. These films are not part of a revolution - they're entertainment. </p> <p>One Day in September, a study of the 1972 Munich Olympic massacre, currently on limited theatrical release, is really a glorified pop promo: rock'n'roll death with Israelis in trendy tracksuits getting blown up to the Rolling Stones. </p> <p>Music-driven archive is a hugely popular genre. TV finds endless ways of repackaging grainy newsy nostalgia via endless mutations of the Rock'n'Roll Years format. One Day in September is the upmarket equivalent, telling an extraordinary story, but marring it with a sub-Scorsese soundtrack. Just as Blaustein's Beyond the Mat takes a flippant subject (wrestling) and draws out profound truths about the American class system, One Day in September does the opposite. It offers up a pivotal historical moment for re-evaluation (Munich, 1972) and turns it into a rock video. </p> <p>The crossover between docs and features is as ubiquitous and messy as ever. When Gillo Pontecorvo made the ground-breaking Battle of Algiers in the mid-60s, a painstaking dramatic reconstruction of guerilla activities staged to look like raw war footage, many critics would not believe that it wasn't real. </p> <p>The debate surrounding faction was as intense then as it is today. Nowadays, however, Hollywood has its own past to faithfully recreate, never mind history. Ridley Scott's Gladiator slugs it out between faithfully recreating Ancient Rome and the Technicolor 60s (with the latter winning out). </p> <p>Today, a local multiplex could happily play the pseudo-documentary, no-fun thrills of a Dogme 95 release next to When We Were Kings, Leon Gast's lush cinematic odyssey about Muhammad Ali, which just happens to be a documentary. The inversion of genres means one looks like old-fashioned Hollywood entertainment, while the other looks like camcorder hell. Both are as real and meaningful as you wish them to be. </p> <p>In spite of the increasingly messy spillage between verit\u00e9 and fiction, social realism and rock promo, the fact remains that we need a clear voice to intepret our times. A need for political documentary film-making remains as pressing today as when B52s were flattening Vietnam. </p> <p>The present has become a foreign country, which many film-makers believe can only be approached tangentially, by reinterpreting the past. Never before has the past looked so alluring. The present is a horrible place: Gillette fighter planes shaving your face; U-boats morph-exploding under water; the on-line frazzle of communication for communication's sake. Never before has our landscape looked so uninteresting, so Trocadero Centre. </p> <p>In this garish, structureless whirl, today's documentaries are a place to stand still. The attraction of a film like James Marsh's Wisconsin Death Trip is the way it looks as if it has been dug from the ground, its total disjunction from the present. Hence its ability to tell us about the present. Gazing on still images of 19th-century homesteaders is like staring at a fresco, as close as any of us will get to sitting quietly in a cold church in our hot foreign country of the present. </p> <p>The story of how Wisconsin Death Trip came to be made further promotes the idea of the project as a forgotten artefact: as an Etruscan fragment, salvaged from obscurity. Director James Marsh came across the book of the title in a secondhand bookshop in New York. As he turned its dusty pages, cameras began to roll. Marsh's story sounds like the beginning of a Hollywood movie in itself (not dissimilar to the Exorcist). The past, though comforting and capable of elucidating the present, can also be a frightening place. The very act of disinterring the book from its grave brings forth demons. </p> <p>Wisconsin Death Trip came out the same week as U-571, an effects-laden movie ostensibly telling the story of the breaking of the Enigma code. Here is a fantastically good subject for a documentary (so good, in fact, that Channel 4 has already made it). As Barry W Blaustein might say, they're exactly the same, except they're completely different. </p> <p>Since Werner Herzog gave up making movies and concentrated on documentaries, he's made some of the best films of his life. I have a fantasy of the world's great directors following Herzog's example. It would make for an intriguing cinema experience, but I'm not sure many would realise they weren't making a movie.</p> <p>\u0095 Beyond the Mat is released on June 30.</p>",

      "body": "<p>In a 17th floor penthouse overlooking Trafalgar Square, Big Ben and the Thames, JJ Curtis, doyen of television celebrities, is in a good mood. He is holding a tabloid newspaper naming his main rival in a porn scandal and he has been having his portrait painted for posterity, wearing a cravat and a red, velvet dressing gown that sweeps the floor.</p> <p>He greets his appointed biographer with old world charm, but his mood changes with the news that the writer wants to resign. The words \"Beg pardon?\" shoot from his lips with the velocity of a pair of bullets. \"No, no, no,\" he says, regaining his composure. \"That would be so ungrateful.\" Behind the gentle demeanour is an inherent menace. </p> <p>Peter O'Toole's face fills the frame of the director's monitor and the familiar blue eyes seem as cold and unwelcoming as Christmas at a Siberian nudist camp. As he films a scene in his new movie The Final Curtain, he sculpts each word with the care of an artist. And yet he claims, that as he has grown older, acting has become increasingly difficult. \"When you're young you just go boom,\" he says. \"It seems to get more difficult the more one knows about it.\" </p> <p>O'Toole has sometimes steered a narrow course between genius and ham, and the indifference of many of his recent films suggests he has not always made the right choice in terms of performance, or projects. The Final Curtain unites the veteran star of Lawrence of Arabia with the writer of Shallow Grave and Trainspotting in a vicious satire on modern television and modern television audiences. O'Toole describes it as \"the most original script I've come across for many years\". It is also the first feature for which writer John Hodge has broken away from the triumvirate he formed with producer Andrew Macdonald and director Danny Boyle and it is being billed as O'Toole's first leading role for over a decade. </p> <p>O'Toole sits facing the door, his Gitane held in vintage cigarette-holder, like a character from a Coward play, except he has dispensed with dressing gown and cravat. He is a commanding figure, even in his vest, with his slacks unfastened to reveal white Y-fronts, in a seeming parody of the fashion for exposing the tops of designer underpants. He commands his little court, enjoying the sunshine and warmth that dances through the open door, while tourists wander down Waterloo Place towards St James's Park oblivious to the proximity of legend. </p> <p>\"This is your first lead role for 10-15 years,\" I begin. \"Not true,\" he says majestically. \"I don't know where you got your information from.\" Well, there is the film company press release, which describes The Final Curtain as his \"first major feature film leading role\" since 1982's My Favourite Year - the film that made it seven Oscar nominations for O'Toole without a win, a record he shares with Richard Burton. \"I saw that too,\" he chirps, his tone noticeably lightening. </p> <p>And then there is the fact that half the stuff he did in the 90s is entirely forgettable. O'Toole's recent oeuvre includes Fairytale: A True Story, in which he played the supporting role of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle; the Emperor of Lilliput in the expensive TV adaptation of Gulliver's Travels; and last year's Old Vic revival of Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell, in which he could finally put his decades of wild living and heavy drinking to creative use.</p> <p>But there were also films like Rebecca's Daughters (in which he played a drunken 19th-century lord who dresses in women's clothes to infiltrate a transvestite road-toll protest group), Molokai: The Story of Father Damien and Dean Koontz's Phantoms. \"Doesn't really matter,\" he says, sounding a little like Eeyore. \"Maybe those weren't released.\" </p> <p>He does not dwell on films once completed and apparently did not see Lawrence of Arabia until years after its release. Despite the accumulation of Oscar nominations, his best-known role remains that first starring role as TE Lawrence. There is a sense of unfulfilled potential. At 67, he is the same age as Michael Caine and slightly younger than Sean Connery, though he seems older. The blond hair is now silver and the thin features are gaunt, almost skeletal, as if a familiar face has been aged by computer technology. </p> <p>O'Toole has had to wait a long time for a film role that could do for him what The Untouchables did for Connery, what Hannah and Her Sisters did for Caine and what Jeffrey Bernard did for O'Toole's own fortunes on stage. He had all but given up hope. \"I'm afraid the scripts have become very poor,\" he says languidly. \"We're going through a very poor passage right now.\" Does this malaise affect the whole of the British film industry, despite the boom in production? \"Is there a British film industry?\" he asks, with what seems like a genuine sense of surprise. \"The British film industry.\" He ponders the notion, chews on the words. \"Sounds like a very good idea.\" </p> <p>\"In times it's been economically sensible for films to be made here,\" he says, \"but there's never been an industry as such.\" He believes the quality of scripts is poor in both Hollywood and Britain, making him all the more enthusiastic when he received the latest offering from Hodge, the quiet-spoken Scot who trained as a doctor before writing Shallow Grave on scraps of paper between seeing patients.</p> <p>The Final Curtain's central character is JJ Curtis, a TV superstar, a national institution, and host of a traditional family game show.

      "bodyText": "In a 17th floor penthouse overlooking Trafalgar Square, Big Ben and the Thames, JJ Curtis, doyen of television celebrities, is in a good mood. He is holding a tabloid newspaper naming his main rival in a porn scandal and he has been having his portrait painted for posterity, wearing a cravat and a red, velvet dressing gown that sweeps the floor. He greets his appointed biographer with old world charm, but his mood changes with the news that the writer wants to resign. The words \"Beg pardon?\" shoot from his lips with the velocity of a pair of bullets. \"No, no, no,\" he says, regaining his composure. \"That would be so ungrateful.\" Behind the gentle demeanour is an inherent menace. Peter O'Toole's face fills the frame of the director's monitor and the familiar blue eyes seem as cold and unwelcoming as Christmas at a Siberian nudist camp. As he films a scene in his new movie The Final Curtain, he sculpts each word with the care of an artist. And yet he claims, that as he has grown older, acting has become increasingly difficult. \"When you're young you just go boom,\" he says. \"It seems to get more difficult the more one knows about it.\" O'Toole has sometimes steered a narrow course between genius and ham, and the indifference of many of his recent films suggests he has not always made the right choice in terms of performance, or projects. The Final Curtain unites the veteran star of Lawrence of Arabia with the writer of Shallow Grave and Trainspotting in a vicious satire on modern television and modern television audiences. O'Toole describes it as \"the most original script I've come across for many years\". It is also the first feature for which writer John Hodge has broken away from the triumvirate he formed with producer Andrew Macdonald and director Danny Boyle and it is being billed as O'Toole's first leading role for over a decade. O'Toole sits facing the door, his Gitane held in vintage cigarette-holder, like a character from a Coward play, except he has dispensed with dressing gown and cravat. He is a commanding figure, even in his vest, with his slacks unfastened to reveal white Y-fronts, in a seeming parody of the fashion for exposing the tops of designer underpants. He commands his little court, enjoying the sunshine and warmth that dances through the open door, while tourists wander down Waterloo Place towards St James's Park oblivious to the proximity of legend. \"This is your first lead role for 10-15 years,\" I begin. \"Not true,\" he says majestically. \"I don't know where you got your information from.\" Well, there is the film company press release, which describes The Final Curtain as his \"first major feature film leading role\" since 1982's My Favourite Year - the film that made it seven Oscar nominations for O'Toole without a win, a record he shares with Richard Burton. \"I saw that too,\" he chirps, his tone noticeably lightening. And then there is the fact that half the stuff he did in the 90s is entirely forgettable. O'Toole's recent oeuvre includes Fairytale: A True Story, in which he played the supporting role of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle; the Emperor of Lilliput in the expensive TV adaptation of Gulliver's Travels; and last year's Old Vic revival of Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell, in which he could finally put his decades of wild living and heavy drinking to creative use. But there were also films like Rebecca's Daughters (in which he played a drunken 19th-century lord who dresses in women's clothes to infiltrate a transvestite road-toll protest group), Molokai: The Story of Father Damien and Dean Koontz's Phantoms. \"Doesn't really matter,\" he says, sounding a little like Eeyore. \"Maybe those weren't released.\" He does not dwell on films once completed and apparently did not see Lawrence of Arabia until years after its release. Despite the accumulation of Oscar nominations, his best-known role remains that first starring role as TE Lawrence. There is a sense of unfulfilled potential. At 67, he is the same age as Michael Caine and slightly younger than Sean Connery, though he seems older. The blond hair is now silver and the thin features are gaunt, almost skeletal, as if a familiar face has been aged by computer technology. O'Toole has had to wait a long time for a film role that could do for him what The Untouchables did for Connery, what Hannah and Her Sisters did for Caine and what Jeffrey Bernard did for O'Toole's own fortunes on stage. He had all but given up hope. \"I'm afraid the scripts have become very poor,\" he says languidly. \"We're going through a very poor passage right now.\" Does this malaise affect the whole of the British film industry, despite the boom in production? \"Is there a British film industry?\" he asks, with what seems like a genuine sense of surprise. \"The British film industry.\" He ponders the notion, chews on the words. \"Sounds like a very good idea.\" \"In times it's been economically sensible for films to be made here,\" he says, \"but there's never been an industry as such.\" He believes the quality of scripts is poor in both Hollywood and Britain, making him all the more enthusiastic when he received the latest offering from Hodge, the quiet-spoken Scot who trained as a doctor before writing Shallow Grave on scraps of paper between seeing patients. The Final Curtain's central character is JJ Curtis, a TV superstar, a national institution, and host of a traditional family game show. (Cinephiles might spot the apparent allusion to an earlier media superstar: JJ Hunsecker was the name of Burt Lancaster's showbiz columnist in Sweet Smell of Success). Curtis's preeminence is challenged by Dave Turner (Aidan Gillen), who hosts a show in which contestants sit in an electric chair. Meanwhile, JJ's doctor tells him he is dying. With his world collapsing, JJ recruits an intellectual, Jonathan Stitch (Adrian Lester), to write his life story, but Stitch does not like what he discovers about the self-styled \"genial Uncle JJ, the housewife's choice\" and wants out. \"We needed someone who was instantly recognisable,\" says producer Chris Young.

This wasn't a Freudian biography of imagined intention but a masterpiece of factual awwangement. I would become S D-S's biogwapher; the biogwapher's biogwapher. What a clever conceit! A parcel of disordered papers awwived from S D-S's publisher. Natuwally, no one else had understood their importance, but after a couple of weadings, I knew they were S D-S's accounts of Linnaeus's voyage to the Maelstwom in Lapland, Galton's journey from Ovampoland to Lake Ngami and Ibsen's meeting with his doppelg\u00e4nger. \"Don't you have a life of your own?\" asked Goode. Silly question. Of course not. I'm a chawacter in a book. But whose book? \"By the way,\" he added, \"the Linnean extracts seem a bit shifty.\" I wushed to the Linnean Society, where I met Fulla Biefield, a pollination ecologist. \"He never went to Lapland,\" she itewated.

The dictionary calls it a treaty, implying it's between enemies. But what remains entirely unclear is whether the government regards private medicine as friend or foe. Ever since Bevan fudged it back in 1948, the NHS has writhed in uncomfortable cohabitation. It has never declared whether private practice is a leech on its back, a partner of sorts or a competitor. This concordat - prematurely announced since nothing is agreed - will define it no better than heretofore. In fact it will muddy the waters yet further. </p> <p>What will it say? It will lay down national principles for local agreements, including possibly national tariffs on cost per operation. It will see that health authorities get value for money, highest quality of care and \"no detriment to the NHS\". Clear as mud. Currently the NHS buys a little, but only very little private treatment for its patients - some 30,000 operations last year. (The NHS did 6.5m.) The supposed purpose of the concordat is to increase the number of NHS patients treated in private hospitals in a blitz on waiting lists, especially in winter months when surgery lists get backed up by flu victims filling surgical beds. It makes sense, they say. So long as the above conditions are all adhered to, waiting lists will be cut, some patients will have a nice time in posh clinics, everyone's happy. </p> <p>But the relationship between the private and the public sector can never be that clearcut as long as most private doctors are also NHS consultants. The balance between the amount of work they do in one or other sector can shift according to perverse incentive. It is the third condition on the concordat that will defy definition - \"no detriment to the NHS\". It's been proven time and again that surgeons with long waiting lists already do the most private practice. If there is suddenly more work available in the local private hospital there's a risk some doctors will reduce their NHS contracts and scuttle down the road to treat the very same people for twice the fee. </p> <p>What might happen if the NHS draws closer to the private sector? Imagine a health authority strikes a good deal with a local private clinic to do 100 hips a year. It goes well. It becomes 200 hips. Insidiously over the years more and more doctors and nurses do more and more sessions in the private hospital and the work in the local NHS hospital dries up. Suddenly the private hospital is the only local hip provider and they can more or less name their price. It becomes like the European system where most state-paid work is provided by the private sector - and unit prices are hugely higher. That is why it matters - not for NHS trade union or ideological reasons but because one of the great (and unsung) successes of the NHS is that it has kept control of costs. It may be cash-starved but it spends its money far better than other western countries because it controls it all. If too much work moves permanently into the private sector, the NHS risks losing financial control of the system. </p> <p>The extent to which the \"concordat\" remains a peculiar and ill-defined beast lies here. The Independent Health Association - with whom the treaty is being negotiated - said yesterday, \"Yes! We want to move over to the European model. That's where we are going. Ask people in Germany or France and they are very happy to be treated in private hospitals. The government needs to mobilise our provision.\" </p> <p>But does the government really want to incur European costs? Is the European model what the government has in mind? \"Of course not!\" say government sources. \"It may be what the private sector wants, but that's not what we are going to agree.\" (So much for a concordat.) It won't happen, they say, because the \"value for money\" caveat means NHS hospitals can only buy private treatment at the same price as it would cost in the NHS . On average, private operations cost twice as much. So far the private sector has offered a few loss-leader deals, using up spare capacity for a few operations at more or less cost. But they couldn't run a significant business that way, paying doctors twice as much, yet charging the NHS the same. Private medicine is tiny - 10,000 beds compared with the NHS's 200,000. This is piffling, marginal, insignificant. </p> <p> So why the big announcement and the big word \"concordat\"? Tell it not in Gath, it's a bit of a political game, they whisper. Shoot the Tory fox. Call their bluff. Remember how last winter the Tories said there'd be no crisis if we used the private sector? This shows we're not ideological, we'll work with anyone to cut waiting lists if they offer the same NHS price. Let the private sector and their Tory advocates put up, or shut up. Add in this: when we cut NHS waiting time to virtually nothing, once the national plan delivers a bright, modern service, no one will use the private sector. It'll be dead in the water - bar a few visiting Arabs. </p> <p>However, Labour may never reach that nirvana unless they build a wall between the private and the state sector, instead of forging concordats. The best way would be to buy out the consultants, pay them more - most deserve it - and make them choose between NHS and private work. </p> <p>Tony Blair plainly regards this concordat as an ideological talisman. He wants both sectors in his big tent. But it isn't that simple and it's not an old Labour class envy thing. Unless he grasps the way private practice fuels the length of NHS waiting lists, he will never reach his no-waiting goal. He should consider the many other ways private medicine coils itself around the NHS. In Surrey, some 30% of hips and even 20% of coronary bypass operations are performed privately. And yet Surrey NHS gets the same per capita government money as poor areas. Shouldn't it be factored into NHS funding? Due to private practice, the population in Hampstead is greatly more likely to be hospitalised than the far sicker population in Tower Hamlets. (Though Hampstead may be suffering hundreds of needless operations - another perverse incentive in private medicine). What does the concordat have to say about these things? </p> <p> The political question is this: was it worth upsetting and angering vast numbers of NHS staff with this concordat? Was it worth angering Labour's heartlands with such talk - just to prove yet again that the Tory policy is rubbish? Come the election, voters are unlikely to credit cheap Tory jibes about waiting lists. Voters can see how 20 years of critical underfunding have left the NHS limping. Everywhere you look it's all held together with sticking plaster by underpaid people. </p> <p>The great fear now is that all this hype about the national plan will raise expectations which cannot be quickly met. The NHS is not going to be modern in a hurry. A reminder of reality: yesterday I was stopped in a Lambeth street by an old lady who asked what day it was. No, she wasn't in the least confused, she just couldn't see. She'd been waiting for a cataract operation for a year. One day in a clinic, NHS or private would give her back her life. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\"> polly.toynbee@theguardian.com </a></p>",

Alan Shearer believes that England will beat Germany in Charleroi tomorrow and go on to qualify for the quarter-finals of the European Championship. </p> <p>Now the bad. Even if England do reach the knockout stage they will have to win Group A to avoid the probability of meeting Italy, the likely winners of Group B, for a place in the semi-finals. </p> <p>Dino Zoff's present team may not be in the class of, say, Enzo Bearzot's successful sides, but to judge from the way they defeated Belgium 2-0 in Brussels on Wednesday night Italy are to Kevin Keegan's England as Tosca is to Fings Ain't What They Used To Be. </p> <p>After two victories in Euro 2000 Italy are entitled to ponder their likely quarter-final opponents, a luxury England can hardly afford having lost 3-2 to Portugal in Eindhoven on Monday. The ramifications of that defeat, suffered after England had raced into a 2-0 lead, rumble on and are bound to gather momentum should a German victory bring an abrupt end to Keegan's interest in the tournament. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, then, the atmosphere around Balmoral is becoming a little tense, with England's coach trying hard yesterday not to appear as jumpy as a grouse on August 12. With the newspaper reporters he was amiable enough, but a question from a television interviewer over a quote about Lothar Matth\u00e4us attributed to Les Reed, one of his coaches, drew a more emotional reaction. </p> <p>Later Keegan explained that his assistants were there to be questioned, not interrogated. Only he himself could expect the Spanish Inquisition but as Monty Python hilariously made clear: \"Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition.\" </p> <p>Keegan quite clearly is approaching the Germany match with three wheels on his wagon, but he still keeps rollin' along. Unless he is a supreme bluffer lost to the world of poker, it would appear that the England coach is set on persisting with a formation similar to that which flourished then folded against the Portuguese. </p> <p>All sorts of alterations to the shape and make-up of tomorrow's side are being suggested but it will be no surprise should Keegan simply make those changes forced upon him by the injuries to Tony Adams and Steve McManaman. This would mean Martin Keown coming into the back four and Dennis Wise playing on the left side of midfield. </p> <p>Until Keegan reveals his hand, however, the sky is the limit on hypothesis. One popular theory is that Paul Scholes could replicate the support that Alan Shearer received from Teddy Sheringham in Euro 96, playing off the England captain with Michael Owen left out and Steven Gerrard providing younger legs alongside Paul Ince in central midfield. </p> <p>If no Gerrard, then why not move Wise into the middle and bring in Nick Barmby on the left? After all, Keegan has said Barmby could give his team something that it had been lacking, so why not pick him? </p> <p>Then there is Emile Heskey, Shearer's preferred partner because this Liverpool striker has the pace and power to worry opposing centre-backs as well as an ability to go wide on the right, stretch defences and provide useful service for the man in the middle. </p> <p>It is a fair point but one which, at this level, has been undermined by Heskey's failure so far to suggest that he could trap a bag of Blue Circle. It will all come down to Keegan weighing up Owen's apparent inability to hold the ball up for Shearer against the youngster's pace, which might make Matth\u00e4us feel even older than his 40 years. </p> <p>Compared with Portugal, Germany will pose less subtle but more athletic problems for England. They have lost the talismanic Oliver Bierhoff to a calf strain but Carsten Jancker is not just about height and heading ability and, with Ulf Kirsten, will pose considerable problems to David Seaman and his centre-backs. </p> <p>Keegan is well aware of the dangers. \"Bierhoff is a proven player at international level,\" he said yesterday, \"but Jancker is big, strong and fast and we know what he is capable of.\" </p> <p>In addition, remembering the way Luis Figo was allowed a free run through the middle to score Portugal's first goal, England must be consistently aware of the threat posed by Mehmet Scholl, who drifts into spaces behind the front pair. </p> <p>\"He is clever with the ball and he's a team player,\" said Keegan. \"It doesn't bother him whether or not he scores and in that sense he's a bit like David Beckham. </p> <p>\"Against Romania he turned the game in five seconds. One moment a move on the right was going nowhere and in the next he had scored a fantastic goal. You have to watch a player like Scholl for 90 minutes.\" </p> <p>Otherwise with Keegan it is still general optimism with a reluctance to be pinned down on specifics. The Germany game, he started to say, had been blown up out of all proportion. But out of proportion to what? A final in 1966 and semi-finals in 1990 and 1996? England will be playing for their lives tomorrow just as much as they were at Wembley (twice) or in Turin. The moment has come a little earlier, that is all. </p> <p>Keegan was asked what he would do if England again found themselves with a two-goal lead. \"Please God I'll have the problem,\" he replied feelingly. \"But if this happens we'll have to defend better as a team than we did against Portugal.\" </p> <p>The England coach quoted the rousing 4-1 victory over Holland in Euro 96, under Terry Venables, as the summit to which his team needed to aspire. \"So far we've not got to that level but we're still capable of doing it,\" he insisted. </p> <p>\"At the moment people keep questioning the things we are doing wrong and they have every right to do that. Until we start winning games against really good sides, and I believe Germany are a good side, the jury are going to be out.\" </p> <p>The only problem with making the performance against Holland in 1996 your acme of excellence is that opponents of any standard are unlikely to defend as badly as the Dutch did that night. The manner in which England lost their lead on Monday was more reminiscent of the way a similar advantage was frittered away by Graham Taylor's team in a World Cup qualifier against Holland at Wembley in 1993. </p> <p>\u0095 Pierluigi Collina will referee England's match with Germany tomorrow. The controversial Italian will be remembered for sending off Paul Ince at the start of England's Euro 2000 qualifying campaign against Sweden in Stockholm.</p>",

Only he himself could expect the Spanish Inquisition but as Monty Python hilariously made clear: \"Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition.\" Keegan quite clearly is approaching the Germany match with three wheels on his wagon, but he still keeps rollin' along. Unless he is a supreme bluffer lost to the world of poker, it would appear that the England coach is set on persisting with a formation similar to that which flourished then folded against the Portuguese. All sorts of alterations to the shape and make-up of tomorrow's side are being suggested but it will be no surprise should Keegan simply make those changes forced upon him by the injuries to Tony Adams and Steve McManaman. This would mean Martin Keown coming into the back four and Dennis Wise playing on the left side of midfield. Until Keegan reveals his hand, however, the sky is the limit on hypothesis. One popular theory is that Paul Scholes could replicate the support that Alan Shearer received from Teddy Sheringham in Euro 96, playing off the England captain with Michael Owen left out and Steven Gerrard providing younger legs alongside Paul Ince in central midfield. If no Gerrard, then why not move Wise into the middle and bring in Nick Barmby on the left? After all, Keegan has said Barmby could give his team something that it had been lacking, so why not pick him? Then there is Emile Heskey, Shearer's preferred partner because this Liverpool striker has the pace and power to worry opposing centre-backs as well as an ability to go wide on the right, stretch defences and provide useful service for the man in the middle. It is a fair point but one which, at this level, has been undermined by Heskey's failure so far to suggest that he could trap a bag of Blue Circle. It will all come down to Keegan weighing up Owen's apparent inability to hold the ball up for Shearer against the youngster's pace, which might make Matth\u00e4us feel even older than his 40 years. Compared with Portugal, Germany will pose less subtle but more athletic problems for England. They have lost the talismanic Oliver Bierhoff to a calf strain but Carsten Jancker is not just about height and heading ability and, with Ulf Kirsten, will pose considerable problems to David Seaman and his centre-backs. Keegan is well aware of the dangers. \"Bierhoff is a proven player at international level,\" he said yesterday, \"but Jancker is big, strong and fast and we know what he is capable of.\" In addition, remembering the way Luis Figo was allowed a free run through the middle to score Portugal's first goal, England must be consistently aware of the threat posed by Mehmet Scholl, who drifts into spaces behind the front pair. \"He is clever with the ball and he's a team player,\" said Keegan. \"It doesn't bother him whether or not he scores and in that sense he's a bit like David Beckham. \"Against Romania he turned the game in five seconds. One moment a move on the right was going nowhere and in the next he had scored a fantastic goal. You have to watch a player like Scholl for 90 minutes.\" Otherwise with Keegan it is still general optimism with a reluctance to be pinned down on specifics. The Germany game, he started to say, had been blown up out of all proportion. But out of proportion to what? A final in 1966 and semi-finals in 1990 and 1996? England will be playing for their lives tomorrow just as much as they were at Wembley (twice) or in Turin. The moment has come a little earlier, that is all. Keegan was asked what he would do if England again found themselves with a two-goal lead. \"Please God I'll have the problem,\" he replied feelingly. \"But if this happens we'll have to defend better as a team than we did against Portugal.\" The England coach quoted the rousing 4-1 victory over Holland in Euro 96, under Terry Venables, as the summit to which his team needed to aspire. \"So far we've not got to that level but we're still capable of doing it,\" he insisted. \"At the moment people keep questioning the things we are doing wrong and they have every right to do that. Until we start winning games against really good sides, and I believe Germany are a good side, the jury are going to be out.\" The only problem with making the performance against Holland in 1996 your acme of excellence is that opponents of any standard are unlikely to defend as badly as the Dutch did that night. The manner in which England lost their lead on Monday was more reminiscent of the way a similar advantage was frittered away by Graham Taylor's team in a World Cup qualifier against Holland at Wembley in 1993. \u0095 Pierluigi Collina will referee England's match with Germany tomorrow. The controversial Italian will be remembered for sending off Paul Ince at the start of England's Euro 2000 qualifying campaign against Sweden in Stockholm.",

      "bodyText": "Lawyers at the Pentagon and the state department have told President Clinton that the United States can begin to build its controversial national missile defence system without violating the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Russia which had previously been understood to outlaw work on such systems. This legal interpretation is certain to be rejected by Russia, which believes that even the most minimal preparatory work on a permanent system would breach the treaty. But the lawyers' view might give Mr Clinton some domestic political \"wiggle room\" on the issue in an election year. By beginning work on the system in the belief that he was not breaching the treaty, Mr Clinton might calculate that he could satisfy US hawks while assuring international critics that Washington was faithful to its treaty pledges. The US is currently researching and developing the proposed missile system, activities that are permitted under the ABM treaty. Mr Clinton is due to decide in the autumn whether to install and deploy the system, after another Pacific Ocean test of its ability to intercept and destroy hostile missiles. The test is due in July. The US admits that deployment would be contrary to the treaty. Washington is trying, so far unsuccessfully, to persuade Moscow to allow a treaty amendment so that the US can go ahead. But according to Pentagon and state department lawyers, the treaty does not preclude work to clear and prepare sites in Alaska and the Aleutian Islands on which the interceptor missiles and their ground-based radar tracking systems would be installed. While Washington tries to square the treaty with its plans, a leading critic of US nuclear weapons policy accused the Pentagon this week of being actively committed to attacking a much bigger list of targets around the world in the event of nuclear war than has previously been made public. Bruce Blair, a former launch officer for the Minuteman missile, claimed in the New York Times (reproduced in part on this page, left) that US war planning is based on the continuing assumption that at least 2,500 warheads must be ready to fire at targets in Russia and China, Iran, Iraq and North Korea. Maintaining such levels on would make the US unable to cut warheads to below the 2,000 ceiling envisaged in the stalled Start III strategic arms limitation talks with Russia. The administration's apparent commitment to national missile defence is causing an increasingly deep divide not only with Russia but with western Europe. But in the administration it is justified on the grounds that Vice-President Al Gore - the Democrats' expected presidential candidate in this year's election - cannot afford to look soft on an issue which Republicans think is an election winner for George W Bush. Paradoxically, the renewed signs that Mr Clinton is looking for ways of taking the first steps on constructing the missile defence system come at the very time North Korea - whose missile programme provides the ostensible threat cited to justify the new system - has held unprecedented public talks about reconciliation with its South Korean neighbour.",
