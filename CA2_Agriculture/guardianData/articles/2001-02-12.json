Bertie Ahern, the Irish prime minister, was discouraged from adding his support to the home team.

Plenty of pebbles on that particular beach.\"</p> <p> <strong> Saturday</strong> </p> <p> What is it with Gary Neville? As if looking like that Dot Cotton off of EastEnders and not knowing where your knives is kept when Becks comes to call is not enough, now the geezer is telling the world that the days of drink ing and boozing and aleing and that is over for the modern professional footballer. All he'll ever have, he says, is the odd alcopop in celebration of a job well done. Well, hark at Miss LaDiDa. Get back to playing girly netball with your sister and leave the manly stuff to them what has the hairs on their chest.</p> <p> <strong> Sunday</strong> </p> <p> That's it, never again. I am going on the Neville. We was all at it, a mass team-bonding session including Vic's new bird, the one he picked up after she done a streak across the Daihatsu during the Liverpool game and bent over to tie up her shoe laces just in front of where he was adjusting his shin pads. Apparently they saw eye to eye straight off. Quality woman.</p> <p>Anyhow, Wattsy reckoned that a goalless home draw was an occasion what needed to be properly celebrated and we should restrict ourselves to alcopops like proper modern professionals. Trouble was the alcopop in question - Mad Dog, a contemporary blast of banana daiquiri and dandelion and burdock - was not a big success, and most of the party moved to Kosovan lager within the half-hour. Since the pop was being given out for nowt as a tester down at the Cross Bar, yours truly reckoned it would be churlish not to stick to it.</p> <p>So I comes downstairs this morning wearing a bear's head (someone must have whipped it off the wall in the hunting-lodge area of the new multi-themed bar complex off of River Street). And I finds Rodders on the dog.</p> <p>\"Good news, boy. Our partners in New York think they may have come up with an appropriately tooled match for you. We've a choice of three American sportsmen: Roy \"Psycho Bob\" O'Grady, linebacker for the Des Moines Mad Axemen, Pablo \"Fists of Steel\" Gardinez from the Santa Monica Illegals basketball outfit and Darius \"The Death\" Warzinski of the Nebraska Skulls ice hockey side.\"</p> <p>\"I was hoping more for your Andre Agassi or Michael Jordan,\" I says.</p> <p>\"Hey, let's be realistic,\" he says. \"There's only one sportsman over here what's got the level of image they would be interested in linking up with: Gary Neville.\"</p>",

Exciting times, boy.\" \"And which particular American sportsman has you got in mind, Rodds?\" \"No names yet, boy. Don't fret, though. Plenty of pebbles on that particular beach.\" Saturday What is it with Gary Neville? As if looking like that Dot Cotton off of EastEnders and not knowing where your knives is kept when Becks comes to call is not enough, now the geezer is telling the world that the days of drink ing and boozing and aleing and that is over for the modern professional footballer. All he'll ever have, he says, is the odd alcopop in celebration of a job well done. Well, hark at Miss LaDiDa. Get back to playing girly netball with your sister and leave the manly stuff to them what has the hairs on their chest. Sunday That's it, never again. I am going on the Neville. We was all at it, a mass team-bonding session including Vic's new bird, the one he picked up after she done a streak across the Daihatsu during the Liverpool game and bent over to tie up her shoe laces just in front of where he was adjusting his shin pads. Apparently they saw eye to eye straight off. Quality woman. Anyhow, Wattsy reckoned that a goalless home draw was an occasion what needed to be properly celebrated and we should restrict ourselves to alcopops like proper modern professionals. Trouble was the alcopop in question - Mad Dog, a contemporary blast of banana daiquiri and dandelion and burdock - was not a big success, and most of the party moved to Kosovan lager within the half-hour. Since the pop was being given out for nowt as a tester down at the Cross Bar, yours truly reckoned it would be churlish not to stick to it. So I comes downstairs this morning wearing a bear's head (someone must have whipped it off the wall in the hunting-lodge area of the new multi-themed bar complex off of River Street). And I finds Rodders on the dog. \"Good news, boy. Our partners in New York think they may have come up with an appropriately tooled match for you. We've a choice of three American sportsmen: Roy \"Psycho Bob\" O'Grady, linebacker for the Des Moines Mad Axemen, Pablo \"Fists of Steel\" Gardinez from the Santa Monica Illegals basketball outfit and Darius \"The Death\" Warzinski of the Nebraska Skulls ice hockey side.\" \"I was hoping more for your Andre Agassi or Michael Jordan,\" I says. \"Hey, let's be realistic,\" he says. \"There's only one sportsman over here what's got the level of image they would be interested in linking up with: Gary Neville.\"",

The ground - two sides tarted up, two run down - testifies to the grandiose ambition of one bad regime after another. </p> <p>The latest departed last week as administrators were called in and the high court granted a 14-day stay of a winding-up order brought by customs and excise and the inland revenue. Hull's debts are around \u00a32m. </p> <p>None of this is new. Lloyd changes locks as often as others change socks and the manager Brian Little, who went there only last April, has been locked out of Wolves and Middlesbrough before. </p> <p>In 1982, too, the club went into receivership. It was saved by Dr Death, the former wrestler Don Robinson, now chairman of Hull Kingston Rovers. He gave City six years in the old Second Division. They have since seen nothing of \u00a320m worth of East Riding boys, including Nick Barmby, Paul Robinson and David Prutton. </p> <p>Saturday's game may have been the last at the ground. In case it was, 8,782 turned up, more than 50% above average. They tossed coins into buckets, drops in the ocean of undying support. The Hull Daily Mail gave away 4,000 placards saying \"Hull City AFC - We'll Support You Ever More\". It hardly looked a lifetime commitment. </p> <p>The ground's exterior is a corrugated patchwork of black and assorted amber that betrays cover-up and short-term residence. The club is under investigation by the Humberside police fraud squad, the Department of Trade and the Football Association. In 1999 a programme wrote: \"The future is bright, the future is amber.\" Now it is only black. </p> <p>Yet only two League clubs have not completed their post- war fixtures: Accrington (1962) and Aldershot (1992). By that progression it is not Hull's turn next but Arsenal in 2022. Mike Moore, joint administrator, is \"pretty confident of sorting it out. We've seen five or six interested parties, including two or three serious players. I think we'll get at least one bid this week.\" The most promising might come from a group headed by Tom Belton, whose ousting as chairman in 1999 led to the investigations. He retains a 30% shareholding. A Tigers Co-operative, boasting 1,100 members, is interested too. </p> <p>The serious players, those on the field, might also \"get something from today,\" said Moore. Like Little and other staff, they have not been paid for five weeks and fall out of contract on Wednesday, when they would be available on free transfers. Last week they were allegedly the club's assets, temporarily frozen. The thaw was in time for them to show it. </p> <p>The distraction did no harm to spirit, which gratified Little. \"If I have to drive them to a club who'll pay them, I'll do it; that's humane. We talk about the problems every day, then get on with training hard. It's all we can do. Deep down we just want to play football. </p> <p>\"The result was not the most important thing today but it was a good day's work on a mucky day. A lot of bad things have been done at this club but we are looking for one conversation that gives us a chance to go on further.\" They are only three places off the play-offs. </p> <p>Hull had no trouble picking out Kevin Francis, their lighthouse of a striker, though he was not wearing pink with yellow spots, and Rodney Rowe got the goal, their first at home for 5 hours, though Lloyd never moved the goalposts. The questions now are whether it is their last and whether Kroll Buchler Phillips get the administrator of the month award.</p>",

The ground - two sides tarted up, two run down - testifies to the grandiose ambition of one bad regime after another. The latest departed last week as administrators were called in and the high court granted a 14-day stay of a winding-up order brought by customs and excise and the inland revenue. Hull's debts are around \u00a32m. None of this is new. Lloyd changes locks as often as others change socks and the manager Brian Little, who went there only last April, has been locked out of Wolves and Middlesbrough before. In 1982, too, the club went into receivership. It was saved by Dr Death, the former wrestler Don Robinson, now chairman of Hull Kingston Rovers. He gave City six years in the old Second Division. They have since seen nothing of \u00a320m worth of East Riding boys, including Nick Barmby, Paul Robinson and David Prutton. Saturday's game may have been the last at the ground. In case it was, 8,782 turned up, more than 50% above average. They tossed coins into buckets, drops in the ocean of undying support. The Hull Daily Mail gave away 4,000 placards saying \"Hull City AFC - We'll Support You Ever More\". It hardly looked a lifetime commitment. The ground's exterior is a corrugated patchwork of black and assorted amber that betrays cover-up and short-term residence. The club is under investigation by the Humberside police fraud squad, the Department of Trade and the Football Association. In 1999 a programme wrote: \"The future is bright, the future is amber.\" Now it is only black. Yet only two League clubs have not completed their post- war fixtures: Accrington (1962) and Aldershot (1992). By that progression it is not Hull's turn next but Arsenal in 2022. Mike Moore, joint administrator, is \"pretty confident of sorting it out. We've seen five or six interested parties, including two or three serious players. I think we'll get at least one bid this week.\" The most promising might come from a group headed by Tom Belton, whose ousting as chairman in 1999 led to the investigations. He retains a 30% shareholding. A Tigers Co-operative, boasting 1,100 members, is interested too. The serious players, those on the field, might also \"get something from today,\" said Moore. Like Little and other staff, they have not been paid for five weeks and fall out of contract on Wednesday, when they would be available on free transfers. Last week they were allegedly the club's assets, temporarily frozen. The thaw was in time for them to show it. The distraction did no harm to spirit, which gratified Little. \"If I have to drive them to a club who'll pay them, I'll do it; that's humane. We talk about the problems every day, then get on with training hard. It's all we can do. Deep down we just want to play football. \"The result was not the most important thing today but it was a good day's work on a mucky day. A lot of bad things have been done at this club but we are looking for one conversation that gives us a chance to go on further.\" They are only three places off the play-offs. Hull had no trouble picking out Kevin Francis, their lighthouse of a striker, though he was not wearing pink with yellow spots, and Rodney Rowe got the goal, their first at home for 5 hours, though Lloyd never moved the goalposts. The questions now are whether it is their last and whether Kroll Buchler Phillips get the administrator of the month award.",

      "body": "<p>Dinner was on Alan Cork on Saturday night. He and Micky Adams, who have worked together at Fulham, Swansea and Brighton, have a long-standing arrangement: loser pays. </p> <p>It is likely to be an expensive day for Cork. The Cardiff manager, upset particularly by Gavin Gordon's sending-off 10 minutes from time, invited retribution from the FA when he laid into the referee, Paul Armstrong, publically doubting his honesty, courage and competence. The final bill should be known this week. </p> <p>Gordon had tangled with Mark Cartwright, the Brighton goalkeeper, in going for a high ball. Cartwright went down - he said afterwards that he had been caught round the ear - and Paul Watson remonstrated with the big striker, then suddenly fell backwards over his goalkeeper. Armstrong consulted a linesman, then showed the red card. </p> <p>\"The fans start shouting and the referee bottled it as usual,\" Cork said. \"The referee obviously wasn't capable of refereeing this match today.\" </p> <p>If, as Armstrong said and Cork believed, Gordon was sent off for his challenge on the goalkeeper, the decision was indeed a poor one. The striker had his back to Cartwright and his eye on the ball. It looked an entirely honest attempt at a header. It was scarcely worthy of a free-kick. Yet Cardiff had been warned when Armstrong booked Leo Fortune-West for a similar challenge in the first half. \"It's hard to work out,\" Cork said. \"Maybe it's because he's 6ft 4in and black.\" </p> <p>Gordon's first name is actually Kenyatta, after one of the heroes of the liberation movement.

      "bodyText": "Dinner was on Alan Cork on Saturday night. He and Micky Adams, who have worked together at Fulham, Swansea and Brighton, have a long-standing arrangement: loser pays. It is likely to be an expensive day for Cork. The Cardiff manager, upset particularly by Gavin Gordon's sending-off 10 minutes from time, invited retribution from the FA when he laid into the referee, Paul Armstrong, publically doubting his honesty, courage and competence. The final bill should be known this week. Gordon had tangled with Mark Cartwright, the Brighton goalkeeper, in going for a high ball. Cartwright went down - he said afterwards that he had been caught round the ear - and Paul Watson remonstrated with the big striker, then suddenly fell backwards over his goalkeeper. Armstrong consulted a linesman, then showed the red card. \"The fans start shouting and the referee bottled it as usual,\" Cork said. \"The referee obviously wasn't capable of refereeing this match today.\" If, as Armstrong said and Cork believed, Gordon was sent off for his challenge on the goalkeeper, the decision was indeed a poor one. The striker had his back to Cartwright and his eye on the ball. It looked an entirely honest attempt at a header. It was scarcely worthy of a free-kick. Yet Cardiff had been warned when Armstrong booked Leo Fortune-West for a similar challenge in the first half. \"It's hard to work out,\" Cork said. \"Maybe it's because he's 6ft 4in and black.\" Gordon's first name is actually Kenyatta, after one of the heroes of the liberation movement. The struggle goes on, of course, but Cork might have been wiser to stay out of it. He has more pressing tasks, which he should be better qualified to deal with. On Saturday he appeared to have picked an excess of central defenders - three started and two more were on the bench - for the task of containing Brighton's single striker, the prolific 20-year-old Bobby Zamora. None of them could be blamed for the goal, which was set up by Matt Brazier's misplaced pass.

      "body": "<p>European competition returns to the football calendar this week with the resumption of the Champions League and the Uefa Cup. Manchester United, Arsenal, Leeds United and Liverpool are all guaranteed further continental excursions this spring, but the future shape of the European club competitions is anything but predictable as the big clubs increasingly assert their power. </p> <p>A two-day meeting of 70 of Europe's leading clubs at Uefa's headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, was largely concerned with tinkering with the format of the two European club competitions, but around the Uefa water cooler the talk was of superleagues and breakaways. Underlying the whole gathering was the tension between Uefa, which is trying to safeguard the integrity of its competitions for all teams, and the continent's richest clubs, who are keen to guarantee the income that regular meetings with other European powerhouses ensures. </p> <p>The main resolution from the Nyon meeting, which included representatives of Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea, Leeds and Liverpool, was that the Uefa Cup should in future have a group stage, guaranteeing more games to those clubs that have missed out on the Champions League. The clubs resolved that the structure of the premier competition itself should remain unchanged for the time being, despite opposition from Uefa; concerns have been raised that the two initial group stages are boring and are driving fans away, and Uefa's general secretary Gerhard Aigner has promised to examine its format. </p> <p>\"There is a feeling that there is too much football on television and this leads to saturation coverage,\" said Aigner. \"Also, I feel that many fans have trouble following two league structures, one in the Champions League and the other in their own domestic league. The Champions League television contract ends in 2003 and we need to have a serious examination of the competition before then. But guaranteed places for a number of the continent's top clubs is not the way forward.\" </p> <p>The latter view is not one shared by Barcelona, to name just one big club. The Catalan giants, who have in the past found qualification to the Champions League troublesome, want to see guaranteed entry into the competition for a fixed three-year period and for the group-stage matches to be preserved. Others such as Bayern Munich want to see fewer group-stage matches and an emphasis on knockout football. </p> <p>Both clubs are members of the so-called G14, the group of 14 rich European clubs which includes Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool. The current distended Champions League structure is the product of an earlier move by leading clubs to split from Uefa and form their own competition. Uefa headed off that initiative but only by giving in to most of the clubs' demands for greater guaranteed income, much as the FA did when it gave in to pressure from the clubs to form the Premier League. Now the S word - superleague - is being whispered again and is likely to become louder as the G14 clubs seek an even larger slice of the cake of television income, part of which is currently channelled through Uefa for the development of the game. </p> <p>The news that the G14, who also include Barcelona, Milan, Juventus, Internazionale, Real Madrid, Porto, Borussia Dortmund, Ajax, PSV Eindhoven, Marseille and Paris St-Germain, have opened an office in Brussels, where they will be able to lobby the European Union directly, and have hired a former Uefa official as their general manager has only added to fears of a breakaway. </p> <p>Arsenal's vice-chairman David Dein, who attended the Uefa meeting, played down such concerns. \"The majority of clubs are comfortable with the format of the Champions League but there is a growing mood to change the Uefa Cup by having eight groups of four teams in the opening stage,\" he said. \"We are confident that the nature of European football can be amended to meet the needs of Europe's top clubs. There is no fear at this stage of any breakaway superleague by the top clubs. I believe that the fans have been brought up on domestic competition and that this is what they want. A European league would not be good for football.\" </p> <p>Likewise Thomas Kurth, the G14's new general manager, insists that the organisation has no intention of challenging Uefa's power or threatening a breakaway league. \"We have not even formally opened our offices yet,\" he said. \"It is just about a group of clubs with a common economic interest coming together.\" </p> <p>But the fact that two G14 clubs were invited by Uefa to take part in negotiations over the future of the transfer system is a sign that the organisation is being given distinct recognition by football officials. With negotiations for a new Champions League television contract due to begin by the end of this year, many within football feel that the G14 will have a big say. </p> <p>Uefa insists that it is not too concerned. Its communications director Mike Lee said: \"The G14 have made it clear to us that they are not interested in a separate competition. They want to work within the current competitions. The dialogue we have had with G14 has been very positive and there is no talk of breakaway leagues as there was a few years ago.\" </p> <p>It could, of course, be that the big clubs see no need to break away if they can achieve their aims underneath the Uefa umbrella. At the moment, though, the biggest impediment to a breakaway may be disunity within the G14 itself, as evidenced by the disagreement between Barcelona and Bayern Munich. </p> <p>In addition to the threat of a superleague based on teams from Italy, England, Spain and Germany, Uefa faces another headache from some of the game's smaller countries. Celtic and Rangers, along with top teams from Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and Sweden, have been lobbying for a breakaway league of their own - sometimes called the Atlantic League - claiming that their domestic leagues are not competitive enough and do not generate enough revenue. </p> <p>At the end of the first day in Nyon, representatives of 13 clubs proposing the Atlantic League met privately to discuss their proposal. Led by Peter Fossen, general manager of PSV, they have been warned by Uefa that they will be kicked out by the European body if they attempt to leave their domestic leagues and form a pan-European weekly competition. </p> <p>Bu the threat has not dented their resolve. Fossen claims that the European tide is too strong to turn back and that cross-border leagues are an inevitability in the future landscape of the game. </p> <p>\"Uefa has to realise that we are living in a different environment; we are within a European community,\" he said. \"The mindset of the organisation has to change and it has to come to terms with the fact that a cross-border European league is going to become a reality. The entire continent is changing and football must change with it.\" </p> <p> <strong> Real Madrid </strong></p> <p> European Cup winners 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1966, 1998, 2000 </p> <p> Affiliation G14 </p> <p> Status One of Europe's mega-clubs, who combine huge turnover with seemingly permanent success on the field. The disaggregation of the Spanish TV market, meaning that clubs may sell their rights individually, should make Real Madrid the club with the largest turnover in Europe in the next few years. </p> <p> Ambitions Although they have an unrivalled European pedigree and a strong grip on this year's domestic league, Real Madrid are also massively in debt. They want to be certain of playing the top sides in Europe every year and G14 are threatening to set up their own competition if Uefa does not give the clubs an even bigger share of Champions League revenue (currently 75%) or guarantee access to the latter stages for the biggest clubs. Real Madrid made \u00a318m by winning the Champions League last year but they believe the competition's television rights are under-sold and that clubs could make more by selling them individually. </p> <p><strong> PSV Eindhoven </strong></p> <p> Winners 1988 </p> <p> Affiliation G14 and Atlantic League </p> <p> Status One of the big three of Dutch football and the current champions, though times have been thinner since their golden age of the late 80s and early 90s.

As a result, PSV have become prime movers behind the Atlantic League. That also suggests they are trying to hedge their bets. Although part of G14 as well, PSV are perhaps not certain they will share fully in any further largesse that can be extracted from Uefa. </p> <p><strong> Red Star </strong></p> <p>Belgrade </p> <p> Winners 1991 </p> <p> Affiliation None </p> <p> Status Once one of Europe's perennial contenders, Red Star are in no state to compete with the money-machines of the west any more. The last team from eastern Europe to win the European Cup, they have suffered grievously from the break-up of Yugoslavia, but also from their lack of TV appeal in west European markets. Like Romania's Steaua Bucharest, also former winners, they form no part of G14's plans and rely on Uefa to funnel at least a small part of the Champions League revenue their way. </p> <p> Ambitions Red Star no longer have even big matches against Croatian rivals to sustain them, let alone top European games, and the domestic league is beset by corruption and hooliganism. Thanks to their long absence from Europe the Yugoslavs have to enter the Champions League at the first qualifying round stage, with the champions of countries such as Luxembourg and Malta. Red Star dream of the days when they rivalled Manchester United but at the moment they would probably settle for regular encounters with Rapid Vienna.</p>",

He knew nothing about the allegation and therefore could say nothing. In any event, Uefa has already said that there is no case to answer. </p> <p>For United this sort of stuff is all so much water under the bridge. For Ferguson what was more to the point was the way his team had performed with so much water falling over the Bridge. </p> <p>If Manchester United can reproduce in Valencia this week the quality of passing and movement which enabled them to dominate Chelsea for much of a game that defied the saturated conditions to provide entertaining, intelligent football from both sides, then they should not lose. </p> <p>In the first round of this season's Champions League United's form away from Old Trafford was poor. But now, with Jaap Stam fit, Roy Keane in sublime form and Ryan Giggs and David Beckham still the masters of their respective crafts, it will be a major surprise if they do not again make the knockout stage. </p> <p>It was a good time to meet a Chelsea side retaining fond memories not only of the 5-0 drubbing they gave the champions at Stamford Bridge last season but also their recovery, in Claudio Ranieri's inaugural game as coach, to force a 3-3 draw at Old Trafford last September after being 3-1 down at half-time. </p> <p>Even with a 15-point (now 13-point) lead at the top of the Premiership Ferguson had little inclination to rest players, although he did keep Teddy Sheringham, his leading scorer, on the bench and Fabien Barthez was not risked because of a troublesome hamstring. United responded with a performance that never suggested their minds were elsewhere, so much so in fact that Chelsea spent the last 20 minutes trapped in their own half. </p> <p>So maybe it was prescience that persuaded Ranieri to withdraw Jesper Gronkjaer, his most likely match-winner, immediately after Andy Cole had brought the scores level midway through the second half. Or maybe replacing Gronkjaer with Slavisa Jokanovic, a defensive midfielder, was just Italian prudence. </p> <p>Either way the quick, strong Dane was beginning to go past Gary Neville with sufficient ease to give Ranieri's attack the edge that United, for all their possession, were struggling to achieve. In the opening minute of the second half Gronkjaer swept through the defence before leaving Jimmy Hasselbaink with just Raimond van der Gouw to beat from close range. Somehow Mikael Silvestre saved United with an excellent covering tackle, and in that moment Chelsea's best chance of victory disappeared. </p> <p>That they had had a chance at all was down to a rare moment of aberration by Paul Scholes, who after Stam had cleared the ball tried to nod it back to the goalkeeper but instead set up Hasselbaink, lingering in the penalty area, for a simple header past Van der Gouw. </p> <p>Just before the hour Van der Gouw messed around with a back pass to the extent that he became trapped near a corner flag by Gianfranco Zola, who then gained possession and found the net from a tight angle only to find the linesman had given a throw-in. Nevertheless United probably still said a prayer for the wellbeing of Barthez's hamstring. </p> <p>They avoided a third Premiership defeat when Andy Cole finally escaped the diligent marking of John Terry and reached a through-pass from Giggs ahead of Marcel Desailly to slip the ball past Carlo Cudicini. \"Our best performance for two weeks,\" said Ferguson, for whom there will never be any time like the present.</p>",

If Manchester United can reproduce in Valencia this week the quality of passing and movement which enabled them to dominate Chelsea for much of a game that defied the saturated conditions to provide entertaining, intelligent football from both sides, then they should not lose. In the first round of this season's Champions League United's form away from Old Trafford was poor. But now, with Jaap Stam fit, Roy Keane in sublime form and Ryan Giggs and David Beckham still the masters of their respective crafts, it will be a major surprise if they do not again make the knockout stage. It was a good time to meet a Chelsea side retaining fond memories not only of the 5-0 drubbing they gave the champions at Stamford Bridge last season but also their recovery, in Claudio Ranieri's inaugural game as coach, to force a 3-3 draw at Old Trafford last September after being 3-1 down at half-time. Even with a 15-point (now 13-point) lead at the top of the Premiership Ferguson had little inclination to rest players, although he did keep Teddy Sheringham, his leading scorer, on the bench and Fabien Barthez was not risked because of a troublesome hamstring. United responded with a performance that never suggested their minds were elsewhere, so much so in fact that Chelsea spent the last 20 minutes trapped in their own half. So maybe it was prescience that persuaded Ranieri to withdraw Jesper Gronkjaer, his most likely match-winner, immediately after Andy Cole had brought the scores level midway through the second half. Or maybe replacing Gronkjaer with Slavisa Jokanovic, a defensive midfielder, was just Italian prudence. Either way the quick, strong Dane was beginning to go past Gary Neville with sufficient ease to give Ranieri's attack the edge that United, for all their possession, were struggling to achieve. In the opening minute of the second half Gronkjaer swept through the defence before leaving Jimmy Hasselbaink with just Raimond van der Gouw to beat from close range. Somehow Mikael Silvestre saved United with an excellent covering tackle, and in that moment Chelsea's best chance of victory disappeared. That they had had a chance at all was down to a rare moment of aberration by Paul Scholes, who after Stam had cleared the ball tried to nod it back to the goalkeeper but instead set up Hasselbaink, lingering in the penalty area, for a simple header past Van der Gouw. Just before the hour Van der Gouw messed around with a back pass to the extent that he became trapped near a corner flag by Gianfranco Zola, who then gained possession and found the net from a tight angle only to find the linesman had given a throw-in. Nevertheless United probably still said a prayer for the wellbeing of Barthez's hamstring. They avoided a third Premiership defeat when Andy Cole finally escaped the diligent marking of John Terry and reached a through-pass from Giggs ahead of Marcel Desailly to slip the ball past Carlo Cudicini. \"Our best performance for two weeks,\" said Ferguson, for whom there will never be any time like the present.",

      "body": "<p>For the time being it is difficult to know which is the more apt: that Tottenham invariably win the FA Cup when the year ends in 1 or that their Premiership form is guaranteed to induce tedium whenever the day ends in \"y\". </p> <p>This was the incapable blundering into the incoherent and, though there was less than a cigarette paper between which team fitted which category, the only surprise was that George Graham should be denied the glory of pontificating about five scoreless Premiership draws in numbing succession. </p> <p>Instead, in the face of Machiavellian rumours that the club's prospective owners Enic plan to make Glenn Hoddle a born-again Spur, Sergei Rebrov's late and wholly unexpected winner gave the Tottenham manager the chance to get his retaliation in first. </p> <p>It was an opportunity he did not squander. There were far too many divisive factions behind the scenes, he complained, and far too many supporters still blinded by his \"Arsenal thing\". It was stirring stuff or it was until that sticky juncture when talk got round to the on-field torpor. \"Okay,\" he grumbled, \"the quality of the football has not been the best.\" </p> <p>As it was, he chose to overlook the reasons behind their failure to win another away game in the Premiership all season or that, faced by one of the league's most porous defences, Rebrov's breakaway strike was their only effort on target and their first league goal for 7hr 42min. </p> <p>So Tottenham's excruciating passage through the annals of sterility chugs along ad absurdum while City remain critical and stable.

      "bodyText": "For the time being it is difficult to know which is the more apt: that Tottenham invariably win the FA Cup when the year ends in 1 or that their Premiership form is guaranteed to induce tedium whenever the day ends in \"y\". This was the incapable blundering into the incoherent and, though there was less than a cigarette paper between which team fitted which category, the only surprise was that George Graham should be denied the glory of pontificating about five scoreless Premiership draws in numbing succession. Instead, in the face of Machiavellian rumours that the club's prospective owners Enic plan to make Glenn Hoddle a born-again Spur, Sergei Rebrov's late and wholly unexpected winner gave the Tottenham manager the chance to get his retaliation in first. It was an opportunity he did not squander. There were far too many divisive factions behind the scenes, he complained, and far too many supporters still blinded by his \"Arsenal thing\". It was stirring stuff or it was until that sticky juncture when talk got round to the on-field torpor. \"Okay,\" he grumbled, \"the quality of the football has not been the best.\" As it was, he chose to overlook the reasons behind their failure to win another away game in the Premiership all season or that, faced by one of the league's most porous defences, Rebrov's breakaway strike was their only effort on target and their first league goal for 7hr 42min. So Tottenham's excruciating passage through the annals of sterility chugs along ad absurdum while City remain critical and stable. There is time to find an antidote but it will not have escaped the attention of their fatalistic fans that the bookmakers are taking bets on Manchester United winning the title and sending them down in the derby game on April 21. Vernon Gomez, the old baseball player, used to say he would \"rather be lucky than good\" and Joe Royle would doubtless concur. Having seen a perfectly good Danny Tiatto goal ruled out by a linesman at Middlesbrough a week earlier, City were on the wrong end of another grave miscarriage of justice here when the referee Steve Dunn inexplicably spotted something amiss as the Spurs goalkeeper Neil Sullivan collided with Sol Campbell while attempting to cut out a corner and Darren Huckerby hooked in the loose ball. \"The referee told me afterwards it was Shaun Goater on Sullivan,\" said Royle. \"In that case I reckon I need to go for an eye test.\" City had the pace to unnerve their guests but so little composure that they unnerved themselves. Egil Ostenstad flashed a header wide from three yards and, for all the chants of \"Feed the Goat and he will score\", Goater rarely threatened to oblige. Then, lo and behold, Spurs scored. Oyvind Leonhardsen set Rebrov free and the hitherto anonymous Ukrainian toe-poked under Nicky Weaver to send City's fans (including one misguided soul wearing a New York Yankees cap) scurrying en masse to the exits. \"I think I'll take the dogs for a walk to the beach,\" sighed Royle, and his affection for animals clearly extends to work.

In a 58-page opinion, the court ruled that Napster \"knowingly encourages and assists its users to infringe the record companies' copyrights.\" But the appeals court said the injunction was too broad and sent the case back to a federal district court to rewrite the order to a more limited ruling on preventing copyright infringement of music. Napster must now prevent users from gaining access to copyrighted content through its lists of songs archived by the service's users, the ruling said. The five music companies will now hope to continue their lawsuit without fear of losing money while downloads continue during what promises to be a lengthy trial.

      "body": "<p>The great frustration for peacemakers is that, just when you think the two sides are closer than ever to agreement, the entire process can unravel. It happened in the Middle East and now threatens Northern Ireland. Before Christmas, the outgoing US president, Bill Clinton, was working feverishly behind the scenes to secure a deal which sought to put the Good Friday Agreement on a permanent footing. There was optimistic talk on both sides, with word of an IRA move on decommissioning so huge that even the most suspicious of Unionists would have to accept it. The republicans would concrete over arms dumps, while the British government would agree to demilitarise, by taking down the loathed army watchtowers that stir such resentment in nationalist areas like south Armagh.</p> <p>According to the plan, the deal would first be agreed by London and Sinn Fein before being handed to the Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble for his grateful acceptance. As one insider close to the talks put it, by the end of the process everyone would agree that \"the Troubles are over\".</p> <p>That optimism has not entirely faded, but the dynamics have changed. Mr Clinton, who was doing so much behind the scenes, even until his last day in office on January 20, has gone. The disciplining effect of that deadline has been replaced with a new one: London officials have let the parties in Belfast know that Tony Blair will not spare much more of his precious time on their problems.

      "bodyText": "The great frustration for peacemakers is that, just when you think the two sides are closer than ever to agreement, the entire process can unravel. It happened in the Middle East and now threatens Northern Ireland. Before Christmas, the outgoing US president, Bill Clinton, was working feverishly behind the scenes to secure a deal which sought to put the Good Friday Agreement on a permanent footing. There was optimistic talk on both sides, with word of an IRA move on decommissioning so huge that even the most suspicious of Unionists would have to accept it. The republicans would concrete over arms dumps, while the British government would agree to demilitarise, by taking down the loathed army watchtowers that stir such resentment in nationalist areas like south Armagh. According to the plan, the deal would first be agreed by London and Sinn Fein before being handed to the Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble for his grateful acceptance. As one insider close to the talks put it, by the end of the process everyone would agree that \"the Troubles are over\". That optimism has not entirely faded, but the dynamics have changed. Mr Clinton, who was doing so much behind the scenes, even until his last day in office on January 20, has gone. The disciplining effect of that deadline has been replaced with a new one: London officials have let the parties in Belfast know that Tony Blair will not spare much more of his precious time on their problems. He has an election to prepare for and has signalled that, after the next week or so, he will concentrate on that rather than them. The same goes for his chief of staff, Jonathan Powell, who has been the lead player in Northern Ireland policy, and the government's de facto chief negotiator, for some time. So Northern Ireland is on notice that a deal has to be done very soon. Does that mean a deal is within reach, or about to disappear from view? The answer is confused. Mr Trimble himself has nodded in both directions. At the end of last month he gave an upbeat assessment of the chances of IRA disarmament; yet on Saturday he told his 110-strong party executive that he would maintain the sanctions he has imposed on Sinn Fein over the IRA's failure to disarm - and even increase them if necessary.

Each has 16 missile tubes capable of firing Trident D5 missiles, which have a range of more than 4,000 nautical miles (more than 4,600 miles) and are accurate to within feet.</p> <p>The anti-nuclear campaigners argue that such weapons of mass destruction are against international law because they cannot distinguish between civilian and military targets.</p> <p>The Faslane peace camp was set up in 1982 to \"non-violently oppose the presence of nuclear weapons at Faslane naval base\", according to its website.

      "bodyText": "More than 300 protesters, including George Galloway MP, were arrested during a demonstration at the home of Britain's Trident nuclear weapon submarines today. It is not the first time that the Faslane naval base on the river Clyde in Scotland has been a target for anti-nuclear campaigners - it has been the subject of demonstrations for nearly two decades. Their main targets are four Trident submarines that live at the base. Each has 16 missile tubes capable of firing Trident D5 missiles, which have a range of more than 4,000 nautical miles (more than 4,600 miles) and are accurate to within feet. The anti-nuclear campaigners argue that such weapons of mass destruction are against international law because they cannot distinguish between civilian and military targets. The Faslane peace camp was set up in 1982 to \"non-violently oppose the presence of nuclear weapons at Faslane naval base\", according to its website. A protest group called Trident Ploughshares began holding vigils, setting up blockades and breaking into the base in the late 1980s after the Trident subs arrived. The same group arranged today's event, known as the Big Blockade. It was a repeat performance of last year's February demonstration, when more than 180 protesters were arrested. Trident Ploughshares members pledge to \"prevent nuclear crime by engaging in peaceful acts of practical disarmament\". In practice, this means using hammers and other tools to put nuclear weapons out of action. The group's name comes from the biblical prophecy found in Isaiah 2:4 and Micah 4:3 to \"beat swords into ploughshares\", but according to the so-called Tri-Denters handbook, the organisation is neither Christian nor Jewish. Among the campaign's backers are Sir Sean Connery, who said he could not attend the protest due to \"filming commitments\", a group of Church of Scotland ministers, and - according to Ploughshares' website - actor Emma Thompson. A total of 15 clergy from the Trident Ploughshares Clergy Action were arrested during today's protest, along with Scottish Socialist Party leader and MSP Tommy Sheridan, Labour MP George Galloway and Green party MEP Caroline Lucas.

      "body": "<p>The Liberal Democrat party today accused the Labour government of not doing enough to solve the financial problems of universities and revealed their own plans for higher education.</p> <p>The Lib Dem leader, Charles Kennedy said: \"Tony Blair and David Blunkett are scratching at the surface of the problems faced in higher education. Liberal Democrats are committed to scrapping tuition fees which is what students want and what students need.\"</p> <p>Only last Thursday, education secretary Mr Blunkett, for the first time, ruled out more fees if Labour wins the next general election. Currently, students are charged a maximum of \u00a31050 a year. </p> <p>Mr Kennedy's comments came as the Lib Dems unveiled their 'higher education package' at a conference at the University of London Union.

      "bodyText": "The Liberal Democrat party today accused the Labour government of not doing enough to solve the financial problems of universities and revealed their own plans for higher education. The Lib Dem leader, Charles Kennedy said: \"Tony Blair and David Blunkett are scratching at the surface of the problems faced in higher education. Liberal Democrats are committed to scrapping tuition fees which is what students want and what students need.\" Only last Thursday, education secretary Mr Blunkett, for the first time, ruled out more fees if Labour wins the next general election. Currently, students are charged a maximum of \u00a31050 a year. Mr Kennedy's comments came as the Lib Dems unveiled their 'higher education package' at a conference at the University of London Union. The package is based on three principles: free education - through the abolition of tuition fees; better access for poor students through the restoration of maintenance grants and limited means tested benefits; and extra funding to improve lecturers' pay and conditions. The Lib Dems higher education spokesperson, Dr Evan Harris, said: \"Our carefully-costed commitments will allow us to restore the principle of higher education free at the point of access, open up our universities to students from poorer backgrounds, remove some of the burden of student debt, abolish the disgraceful pay gap that exists for female academics and tackle the recruitment and retention crisis affecting lecturers and researchers.\" The Lib Dems say that they would pay for the higher education reforms by raising extra taxes. An extra penny in income tax would generate approximately \u00a33.1bn in new income. The Lib Dems would channel \u00a3730m into universities, with the rest used for schools. A spokesperson for the National Union of Students said that the NUS did not endorse the proposals, but welcomed the widening of the student funding debate. The Liberal Democrats package includes the following proposals: \u0095 The abolition of tuition fees \u0095 The restoration of means-tested maintenance grants funded by the graduate endowment scheme that has proved both popular and effective in Scotland \u0095 A net reduction in student debt for all students especially those from poorer backgrounds \u0095 Access to income support and housing benefit in the summer vacation for those students unable to find work \u0095 Full funding of the Bett Commission proposals to bridge the pay gap between male and female academics and reverse the casualisation of teaching posts \u0095 Triple the premium paid to universities to fund increased applications from, and retention of, under-represented student groups \u0095 Increase significantly the unit of funding per student to improve quality in higher education \u0095 Concentrate expansion of student numbers on shortage areas such as health professionals, IT graduates and teachers \u0095 Raise the income threshold at which students start to repay their loans to a rate higher than the average non-graduate starting salary",

Their discovery promises new treatments for a whole range of diseases and deepens the mystery of life. It reveals that the genes - which hold the instructions for the proteins of which human tissue is made - occupy only about a hundredth of the length of the huge string of DNA, broken up into the 23 chromosomes in every cell. </p> <p>Researchers had, when the project began, predicted there might be 70,000 to 140,000 genes. They believed that one gene contained the code for one protein which would have one function. Instead, the international consortium of scientists behind the publicly funded research into the human genome project say in Nature this week that they calculate that there could be as few as 30,000 genes in the human blueprint, and no more than 40,000. </p> <p>Craig Venter, of the biotech firm Celera Genomics, whose rival team publishes its findings in Science this week, is in close agreement, putting the total at between 26,000 and 38,000. </p> <p>\"The small number of genes has tremendous implications, and you should be asking the question: why is the small number of genes surprising? I think it happened for several reasons. The fruit fly genome has 13,000 or so genes in it, and everybody was thinking we are so much bigger and smarter on average than fruit flies that we should have a lot more genes. Then look at our everyday language,\" said Dr Venter. </p> <p>\"People talk about you got the gene for this from your mother and the gene for that from your father, and so if you think that we are hard-wired and that everything is deterministic, there should be a lot of genes, because we have a lot of different traits. So I think a lot of people were expecting that to be the case.\" </p> <p>But the vastly smaller number of genes means that biologists can no longer assume that one gene is a blueprint for one protein that has one function. Nature has found a way of making \"executive\" genes that do very sophisticated management work. Sir John Sulston, of the Sanger Centre at Cambridge, one of the leaders of the international effort, said that the similarity to other creatures provided confirmation, at the level of molecules, for Darwin's theory of evolution formulated 150 years ago. The same genes, with little adjustments, had been used throughout the 3.8bn year story of evolution. </p> <p>\"It is the unity of life, of nature being conservative, or the idea of the Blind Watchmaker - the notion of evolution as a constant reworking or random recombining of parts. You convert your Austin 7 into a Mercedes, but basically it is the same underneath,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We know that as we move up the ladder of complexity from the single cell creatures, through small animals like worms and flies, and up to us, what we are adding on is control genes,\" Sir John said. \"What we are doing is to increase the variety and subtlety of genes that control other genes.\" </p> <p>The completed map of the human genome has other surprises. The genes themselves - sequences of four chemical bases that spell out the instructions for making a protein - occupy only 1.1% of the chromosomes. The rest has in the past been dismissed as \"junk,\" useful for identifying a genetic fingerprint, but no more. But both teams of scientists now believe that this junk DNA could form part of the great story of evolution. </p> <p>\"We have to look beyond the genes,\" said Richard Gallagher, biology editor of Nature. \"We know what they are. We don't know what the rest of the stuff is that is sometimes called junk. It is that drawer you have got at home that is stuffed with memorabilia. Some things are essential, like your passport and birth certificate: they are your genes. But there is other stuff that gives insight into who you are and where you came from and why you do the things that you do.\" </p> <p>The publicly funded scientists - backed by the US, Britain, France, Germany, China and Japan - also reveal that hundreds of genes appeared to have been transferred into the chromosomes by invading bacteria, effectively making humans, and all other vertebrates, genetically modified organisms. Comparison of the genomes of other creatures - scientists have published the DNA of many microbes, yeast, a nematode worm, a fruit fly, and a little weed called thalecress - could give clues to the 3.8bn year mystery of evolution. </p> <p>But the same information rules out another habit of thinking called genetic determinism: the argument that humans might be little more than robots controlled by their genes. \"Understanding the human genome will not take away the concept of free will,\" said Francis Collins, one of the US leaders of the international partnership. \"Understanding the human genome will not help us very much to understand the spiritual side of human kind or to know who God is, or what love is.\" </p> <p>The research also removes any grounds for racism. Researchers have so far collected almost a million tiny variations in the genetic code - single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs - that might explain why humans differ from each other. The variation between any two individuals in the same population could be greater than that between two different groups. Nobody knows the identities of the people who donated their DNA for the publicly funded team, but Dr Venter deliberately selected DNA from five individuals, one Asian-American, one African-American, one Hispanic-American and two others and found no way of telling which was which. </p> <p>\"No serious scholar in this field considers race to be a scientific concept,\" he said. \"We all evolved out of the same three or four groups in Africa, as black Africans. With migrations, different populations were fixed. But there is more diversity within Africans than there is between Africans and Caucasians. We are part of a continuum because we evolved from the same set of people over a very short period of time.\" </p> <p>The research promises new treatments for a huge range of diseases, all of which must have some genetic component. It could, ultimately answer questions about the nature of life itself. It could also answer riddles about addictions such as gambling, or provide treatments for jet-lag, or sleep disorders, or mental illness. But the chiefs of both teams warn that there is a long way to go - even if there are only 26,000 genes to examine. </p> <p>\"It requires tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of good minds looking at it in an unfettered way, doing experiments, to really make the contribution that the human genome project information is capable of,\" Sir John said. \"It is a very basic set of instructions and we have got to learn how our growing bodies interpret these instructions to make a human being.\" </p> <p><strong>Facts of life</strong><br></p> <p><strong>What they discovered:</strong><br> </p> <p>\u0095 Hundreds of genes have been smuggled into the human chromosomes by bacteria. </p> <p>\u0095 Humans have only twice as many genes as a simple worm or a fly. </p> <p>\u0095 There is no scientific basis for race.

      "body": "<p>The \"book of humankind\" - the entire 3bn-letter genetic code of a representative human - is revealed by two competing journals today. </p> <p>Although it could answer questions about human evolution and promise startling new cures for disease, paradoxically it has also deepened the mystery of life. The genome reveals that the human chromosome carries only about 30,000 genes, twice the number of a fruit fly, 10,000 more than a roundworm, and only a few hundred more than a mouse. Originally scientists expected as many as 140,000, which means the question of how genes actually work is now an even bigger mystery. </p> <p>The genome also reveals that many human genes originate from microbes which over aeons smuggled their genetic material into human cells and stayed. This raises questions about human evolution. </p> <p>Scientists who raced to complete a document so long that it may never be printed in full said the human genome could open an era of a new kind of medicine - one tailored to a patient's unique genetic makeup. </p> <p>\"It will be individualised medicine where we'll treat the individual person for the right disease, with the right medicine, at the right dose, at the right time,\" said Mike Dexter, director of the Wellcome Trust, the charity which launched the British research. </p> <p>The effort, by an international consortium of scientists backed by taxpayers and charity, began almost 20 years ago with a search for the genetic cause of muscular dystrophy and other inherited diseases. It accelerated two years ago when a private group, Celera Genomics, joined the hunt for genes. </p> <p>When the two groups made a truce and announced jointly last June that they had reached their target, the achievement was compared with the invention of the wheel - and one scientist spoke of an end to cancer in his lifetime. Since then, the two teams have fallen out and challenged each other's methods. </p> <p>The Celera group claims its sequence is complete.

      "bodyText": "The \"book of humankind\" - the entire 3bn-letter genetic code of a representative human - is revealed by two competing journals today. Although it could answer questions about human evolution and promise startling new cures for disease, paradoxically it has also deepened the mystery of life. The genome reveals that the human chromosome carries only about 30,000 genes, twice the number of a fruit fly, 10,000 more than a roundworm, and only a few hundred more than a mouse. Originally scientists expected as many as 140,000, which means the question of how genes actually work is now an even bigger mystery. The genome also reveals that many human genes originate from microbes which over aeons smuggled their genetic material into human cells and stayed. This raises questions about human evolution. Scientists who raced to complete a document so long that it may never be printed in full said the human genome could open an era of a new kind of medicine - one tailored to a patient's unique genetic makeup. \"It will be individualised medicine where we'll treat the individual person for the right disease, with the right medicine, at the right dose, at the right time,\" said Mike Dexter, director of the Wellcome Trust, the charity which launched the British research. The effort, by an international consortium of scientists backed by taxpayers and charity, began almost 20 years ago with a search for the genetic cause of muscular dystrophy and other inherited diseases. It accelerated two years ago when a private group, Celera Genomics, joined the hunt for genes. When the two groups made a truce and announced jointly last June that they had reached their target, the achievement was compared with the invention of the wheel - and one scientist spoke of an end to cancer in his lifetime. Since then, the two teams have fallen out and challenged each other's methods. The Celera group claims its sequence is complete. The consortium claims it will have a \"gold standard\" genome in two years. There is bitter disagreement about who should have access to the information. The public consortium argues that the information is so important it should be available to all, freely. But both concede the final publication has raised a new set of mysteries for science.

The scheme will cost \u00a325m in the first year.</p> <p>Along with the \u00a36,000 training salaries given to all postgraduate teachers, it means some staff will receive about \u00a320,000 from the taxpayer for choosing teaching.</p> <p>On the eve of the government's five-year plan for improving secondary education, unions said Mr Blunkett was finally acknowledging the recruitment \"crisis\". Though the number of trainee teachers is up, recruits for postgraduate teaching courses in English and maths have risen by just 2% and 1% respectively and the government is about 12,000 teachers short of its targets for key subjects.</p> <p>Mr Blunkett also plans to offer three-month teacher training courses for undergraduates during summer holidays, with \u00a32,000 grants. Undergraduates could also do training modules as part of their subject degree course, without the extra money.</p> <p>These graduates would then go straight into the classroom, with top-up training, rather than complete a full postgraduate teaching qualification.</p> <p>Mr Blunkett will today announce that he is looking at options of giving undergraduates on four-year B.Ed courses money in their final year. They could either receive the \u00a36,000 training salary or go into full-time teaching backed by the \u00a313,000 salary given to those who opt for the graduate teacher programme, which involves training \"on the job\".</p> <p>David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the new scheme should be extended \"so that any young graduate who wants to go into teaching can be free of student debt\".</p> <p>NASUWT general secretary Nigel de Gruchy said he welcomed the measure, but added: \"It does smack of panic and it proves that NASUWT was right in describing the present situation over teacher recruitment as a crisis and not just a problem.\"</p> <p>Today's green paper on secondary education will focus on diversity, raising standards and developing the talents of individual pupils.</p> <p>With the number of subject-specialist schools set to expand to 1,500 by 2006 - 46% of all secondary schools in England - Mr Blunkett called for each school to develop its own distinctiveness. \"We want diversity within a modernised comprehensive system. We want to ensure that we can play to the strengths of individual schools so that they can develop their own ethos,\" he said on the BBC's Breakfast with Frost.</p> <p>A \u00a335m \"pupil learning credits\" scheme will increase provision of cultural activities such as music, dance and art, often already available for middle-class children at home, for 60,000 youngsters over two years in inner cities.</p>",

      "bodyText": "New teachers in shortage subjects in England are to have their student loans paid off as one of an array of financial incentives to encourage recruitment unveiled yesterday by the education secretary, David Blunkett. Graduates in English are to join those in other shortage subjects - maths, science, technology and modern languages - in becoming entitled to \u00a34,000 \"golden hellos\" from the government when they take up teaching. Those graduates will now also have their government student loan written off at 10% a year over 10 years - a deal worth about \u00a310,000 for each graduate. The scheme will cost \u00a325m in the first year. Along with the \u00a36,000 training salaries given to all postgraduate teachers, it means some staff will receive about \u00a320,000 from the taxpayer for choosing teaching. On the eve of the government's five-year plan for improving secondary education, unions said Mr Blunkett was finally acknowledging the recruitment \"crisis\". Though the number of trainee teachers is up, recruits for postgraduate teaching courses in English and maths have risen by just 2% and 1% respectively and the government is about 12,000 teachers short of its targets for key subjects. Mr Blunkett also plans to offer three-month teacher training courses for undergraduates during summer holidays, with \u00a32,000 grants. Undergraduates could also do training modules as part of their subject degree course, without the extra money. These graduates would then go straight into the classroom, with top-up training, rather than complete a full postgraduate teaching qualification. Mr Blunkett will today announce that he is looking at options of giving undergraduates on four-year B.Ed courses money in their final year. They could either receive the \u00a36,000 training salary or go into full-time teaching backed by the \u00a313,000 salary given to those who opt for the graduate teacher programme, which involves training \"on the job\". David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the new scheme should be extended \"so that any young graduate who wants to go into teaching can be free of student debt\". NASUWT general secretary Nigel de Gruchy said he welcomed the measure, but added: \"It does smack of panic and it proves that NASUWT was right in describing the present situation over teacher recruitment as a crisis and not just a problem.\" Today's green paper on secondary education will focus on diversity, raising standards and developing the talents of individual pupils. With the number of subject-specialist schools set to expand to 1,500 by 2006 - 46% of all secondary schools in England - Mr Blunkett called for each school to develop its own distinctiveness. \"We want diversity within a modernised comprehensive system. We want to ensure that we can play to the strengths of individual schools so that they can develop their own ethos,\" he said on the BBC's Breakfast with Frost. A \u00a335m \"pupil learning credits\" scheme will increase provision of cultural activities such as music, dance and art, often already available for middle-class children at home, for 60,000 youngsters over two years in inner cities.",

      "body": "<p>Today is another red-letter day for the final year pupils at Hollybush primary school in Derry, and there have been plenty of them of late.</p> <p>Last Wednesday, they sang in the school choir to welcome the Northern Ireland education minister, Martin McGuinnness, who came to open a new nursery class and computer suite. And when they arrive at school this morning, those primary seven children, like all their counterparts across Northern Ireland, will share their big news of the weekend, their 11-plus results, which arrived in the post on Saturday.</p> <p>The school's results are even better than last year: 23 As, four B1s, two B2s, two C2s and four Ds. In Northern Ireland as a whole, only 25% of all pupils, including about 8,000 who did not take the test (among them three at Hollybush) got As. It is the same ratio every year: more a competition than a test.</p> <p>Tomorrow and the day after their parents will file into school for meetings with Pat McLaughlin, the principal, for advice on which grammar schools they should apply for, or whether they should at all. Though the so-called transfer tests were taken back in November, this week is effectively the culmination of a whole school year. Across Ulster as a whole, only about 35% of students will win places at grammar school; at Hollybush it will be much higher. The A grade students are certain, and the B grades almost certain, of a grammar school place. The rest will have to sweat.</p> <p>\"We grind the children from Easter,\" Mr McLaughlin said. \"Maths, English, science. We don't do art, we hardly say a prayer. Even during the summer holiday they work. Then they come back and they have six weeks until the test. And then it's two hours to decide their whole life.\"</p> <p>Soon most of the choir that sang for Mr McGuinness will be scattered across the schools of Derry, to St Columb's, Lumen Christi, Foyle and Londonderry, or Thornhill grammar schools, or to Oakgrove, a religiously integrated comprehensive in the city, or to secondary school - St Brigid's, St Joseph's, St Celia's or St Mary's.</p> <p><b> Unhappy experience</b><br></p> <p>Thirty-nine years ago, as a pupil at another primary school in Derry, St Eugene's, Mr McGuinness took his 11-plus. \"My experience with the 11-plus was a very unhappy one. I actually didn't do the 11-plus in the school that I was taught in. We were taken out of our school and brought several miles away to what was an alien place [Templemore school] and sat down in a room where I'd never been before,\" Mr McGuinness said.</p> <p>\"It is my opinion that no education system has the right to tell any child at the age of 10 and 11 that it's a failure ... I just find it totally abhorrent that a child at that age toddles down the stairs on a Saturday morning in spring, lifts up the envelope and has either success or failure staring them in the face.\" He ended up going to the Christian Brothers technical college, known as the Brow 0' The Hill, next to where Lumen Christi now stands.</p> <p>\"I enjoyed primary, I didn't enjoy secondary school,\" Mr McGuinness said. \"The majority of the Christian brothers in the school I attended were good, decent people, very concerned about education. But there were a small minority who were not such good teachers and they played a very negative role in terms of my education.\"</p> <p>This 11-plus failure is now in charge of Northern Ireland's schools. And though he is waiting for a report from an independent review of post-primary education, there is no doubt he intends to ensure this year's primary seven class is among the last to take the transfer test. More than a year on, it is still common to find people rubbing their eyes at the sight of Mr McGuinness, who left school at 15 and in time became IRA chief of staff, being put in charge of a budget of \u00a31.33bn and the educational interests of 349,000 children. But he has been getting on with it, to some acclaim.</p> <p>\"Definitely more pluses than minuses,\" said Tom McKee, Northern Ireland officer of the NASUWT, the largest teaching union in Ulster. \"His record as a minister inside the teaching profession is quite impressive. He can master a brief very quickly, he can make a decision, he's not tied to departmental advice.\"</p> <p>It was a surprise, and to many a provocation, when Mr McGuinness took the education brief when the executive posts were shared out in December 1999. At Sinn Fein's office on the Falls Road in Belfast, he told the Guardian: \"There were various opinions within the leadership of Sinn Fein which department I should choose, to such a point where Gerry Adams said to me, well, you make the choice. And I chose education because I thought education is a very, very crucial department. I think it does more to put you at the heart of government than most other departments and at that stage I hadn't considered the size of the budget.\"</p> <p>There were protests in some unionist schools when Mr McGuinness became minister. Aside from an early visit to the Methodist college in Belfast, he has been to few mainly protestant schools.</p> <p>Sinn Fein councillors continue to put pressure on Catholic head teachers not to invite the RUC in for talks on road safety and drugs. Sammy Wilson of the Democratic Unionist party, deputy chairman of the education committee, said: \"I approach any view of McGuinness from the point of view of his background. I don't believe that it is right that someone who has been involved in terrorising this community for the last 30 years and still has the ability to do so - because, of course, his organisation is intact, the arms are still there - I don't believe someone like that should be rewarded by being given a ministerial position. More important than that I think he lacks the moral authority to be a minister.\"</p> <p>And still, the wider process intrudes. In the car park at Hollybush, he is interviewed about comments made by Ulster Unionist minister Michael McGimpsey, suggesting police reform should be held up until the IRA decommission. That day he cancels lunch with the visiting head of Unesco to take part in telephone talks with the British and Irish governments.</p> <p>But the other week, Downing Street called his office not over the process but to inquire about his sudden announcement that he was scrapping the publication of performance league tables. Though reforming post-primary education is a much bigger mountain to climb, Mr McGuinness is taking it in stages. Following the publication of a two-year research project on selective education, the minister appointed the former Northern Ireland ombudsman, Gerry Burns, to head the review. The review will report later this year. \"We're into major change for our society here in Northern Ireland and the review body aspires to producing a report that can be an exemplar to any other country,\" said Mr Burns.</p> <p><b> Passion and possibility</b><br></p> <p>Inside and outside the 25 public meetings and 700 hundred submissions gathered by the review group, people in Northern Ireland are starting to talk about education with passion and sense of possibility. Principals such as William Raven, at St Patrick's college in Ballymena, a Catholic secondary school in a small town of 60,000, where four grammar schools take something like half the top 11-plus pupils, great efforts have to be made to rebuild pupils' self-esteem. At Mount Gilbert College, a secondary school in the loyalist Shankill in Belfast, the teachers face the same problems. \"The people who want to put up an argument for keeping the 11-plus don't have to deal with the people who don't get it,\" said Philip Hutton, head of maths. In the Shankill, something like one in a hundred children pass the transfer test.</p> <p>But the arguments for keeping the grammar school system are there, strong because Northern Ireland consistently produces better exam results than anywhere in Britain, has fewer students leaving school with no GCSEs, and more working-class students going to university. Strong too because of uncertainty about what to replace it with. Wilfred Mulryne, head of the Methodist college in Belfast, which only takes A-grade students as day pupils, warned that scrapping grammar schools would lead to \"selection by postcode\" as in England, hurting clever poor children. He is certain that the introduction of a fully comprehensive system would lead to some grammar schools going private.</p> <p>\"There is no evidence from anywhere that a reorganisation to all-ability comprehensive schools would actually improve outcomes,\" said Dr Mulryne. Better, says Sammy Wilson, selection by results than by interview. \"A lot of this has been driven by the middle class lobby. Someone said to me that the one thing the middle class can't do is buy success in the transfer procedure.\" But Mr Burns is looking for consensus: \"I genuinely would not wish to produce a report which would have any significant opposition from a grouping within the educational world. That would just in my view negative the whole thing that we're doing.\"</p> <p>At times, talking about education if no other subject, Mr McGuinness sounds like a 1960s progressive teacher from England. \"Yes the 3 Rs are important ... we also need the three Ens in education - we need encouragment, we need enjoyment, we need enlightenment. All of that is important and we want to put in place an education system which encourages our young people to see the merits of a good education, which encourages our teachers.\" Abolishing the league tables, Mr McGuinness said, did \"more for the morale of schools and teachers than the threat of naming and shaming them that seems to be the approach in England\".</p> <p>It has also not passed anyone by that in the rest of Ireland, there are no league tables, and no selective system. \"If for example you asked, as many people have asked previously, how this phenomenon of the Celtic tiger actually came about, nearly everybody would say it came about because of education,\" said Mr McGuinness. He went to court to prevent David Trimble, the first minister, banning him from attending ministerial meetings with his southern Irish counterpart, Michael Woods. He has made it easier for Irish-language and religiously-integrated schools to set up. Sammy Wilson has accused the minister of skewing the school-building programme to favour Catholic schools: he denies it. Sinn Fein's radicalism is imbedded with reassurance: trying to show the whole community the world won't fall in if they run departments.</p> <p>His most waffley answer comes when he is asked what he wants pupils to be taught about the IRA. \"I would like them to be taught that there was no IRA, there was no UDF, I'd like people to obviously look at it honestly at the history of where we've come from, to look at what has happened in Ireland over the last 800 years ...\"</p> <p>He said he has met teachers from state - that is, mainly protestant - schools in private many times, and that the meetings have been \"absolutely brilliant\". He thinks he will need assembly legislation to push through changes to secondary education.</p> <p>That is as big an \"if\" as whether the assembly itself will still be there even to let him try. \"If I were a betting person I would say he will find it very difficult to get it through,\" said Mr Wilson. But if he did, Mr McGuinness and his opponents are well aware what a milestone that would be.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.educationreviewni.gov.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.educationreviewni.gov.uk</a><br> The Review Body on Post Primary Education</p>",

      "body": "<p>A 10-year education plan is unveiled today. But, true to this government's tradition of pre-publication leaks, we already know the main framework. On one important front, teacher recruitment, the government is still in trouble. Yet another bribe to attract recruits has been unveiled this week-end - paying off student loans over time to people who enter the profession.</p> <p>Ministers have been ingenious in the use of such lures: first with \u00a34,000 \"golden hellos\" in shortage subjects in 1999; then last year's \u00a36,000 training salaries for all postgraduate training courses; now student loan paybacks. Ministers point to a dramatic rise in applications, but extra admissions have been much less spectacular. The \"golden hellos\" saw applications for maths courses rise by 460 in 1999 (a 48% increase on the previous year), but actual admissions went up by only 200, leaving total numbers still 23% below the target of 1,810 maths trainees. A similar pattern applied to science: applications up by 711, but admissions by only 84, although total science trainees only fell 3% below target.</p> <p>Under the new plan, maths and science teachers would have their student loans written off over a 10-year period. Teaching union leaders welcomed the new initiative yesterday, but noted it needed to go beyond maths and science. This will make them even more unpopular with the education secretary, who was brutally scathing about their lack of leadership yesterday, but on this issue the unions are right. There are teacher recruitment shortages in all school subjects except PE and history. Recruits are in such short supply that physics or maths graduates who have barely qualified (a third class degree or lower) can still gain admission to postgraduate teaching courses. Entry levels on undergraduate education courses are even more dismal.</p> <p>Ministers have been ingenious in distributing the funds they have received to maximum effect. Last week's 3.7% pay award had extra perks, which lifted the package to 4.2%. What was missing was sufficient funds to begin restoring the earlier status of teachers. A 4.2% pay award, in a year in which average earnings are increasing by 4.2%, leaves teachers on precisely the same lowly rung. A generation ago they got 37% above the white-collar average. Now they are barely above the average. What is needed is a five-year pay plan which will ensure they are pushed back up the ladder.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A 10-year education plan is unveiled today. But, true to this government's tradition of pre-publication leaks, we already know the main framework. On one important front, teacher recruitment, the government is still in trouble. Yet another bribe to attract recruits has been unveiled this week-end - paying off student loans over time to people who enter the profession. Ministers have been ingenious in the use of such lures: first with \u00a34,000 \"golden hellos\" in shortage subjects in 1999; then last year's \u00a36,000 training salaries for all postgraduate training courses; now student loan paybacks. Ministers point to a dramatic rise in applications, but extra admissions have been much less spectacular. The \"golden hellos\" saw applications for maths courses rise by 460 in 1999 (a 48% increase on the previous year), but actual admissions went up by only 200, leaving total numbers still 23% below the target of 1,810 maths trainees. A similar pattern applied to science: applications up by 711, but admissions by only 84, although total science trainees only fell 3% below target. Under the new plan, maths and science teachers would have their student loans written off over a 10-year period. Teaching union leaders welcomed the new initiative yesterday, but noted it needed to go beyond maths and science. This will make them even more unpopular with the education secretary, who was brutally scathing about their lack of leadership yesterday, but on this issue the unions are right. There are teacher recruitment shortages in all school subjects except PE and history. Recruits are in such short supply that physics or maths graduates who have barely qualified (a third class degree or lower) can still gain admission to postgraduate teaching courses. Entry levels on undergraduate education courses are even more dismal. Ministers have been ingenious in distributing the funds they have received to maximum effect. Last week's 3.7% pay award had extra perks, which lifted the package to 4.2%. What was missing was sufficient funds to begin restoring the earlier status of teachers. A 4.2% pay award, in a year in which average earnings are increasing by 4.2%, leaves teachers on precisely the same lowly rung. A generation ago they got 37% above the white-collar average. Now they are barely above the average. What is needed is a five-year pay plan which will ensure they are pushed back up the ladder.",

These bodies are accused of focusing on the needs of larger businesses. </p> <p>A small number of new online communities claim to represent the self-employed and provide them with specialist services. </p> <p>This week Mongrel Worlds, a venture capital-backed start-up, added to the list with a \"21st century guild\" targeted at self-employed professionals under the banner name, Alodis.

      "bodyText": "The government's support for business was extended last week when Tony Blair said ministers needed to devise policies to back the self-employed. The prime minister said the government had to listen to the concerns of the self-employed, who were a vital part of the economy and needed to increase in number. Many self-employed groups, such as computer contractors, have complained that they are treated with suspicion by government departments including the Department of Trade and Industry and the Inland Revenue. The dispute over the tax rule IR35, which restricts the ability of contractors to be directors of their own limited companies and pay themselves in dividends, proved to many that Labour ministers failed to understand the nature of their business and the minefield of tax rules they faced. Self-employed workers have complained they are neglected by their trade bodies, associations and unions. These bodies are accused of focusing on the needs of larger businesses. A small number of new online communities claim to represent the self-employed and provide them with specialist services. This week Mongrel Worlds, a venture capital-backed start-up, added to the list with a \"21st century guild\" targeted at self-employed professionals under the banner name, Alodis. It plans to step in where it believes the Confederation of British Industry, the Institute of Directors and the Federation of Small Businesses have failed. Alodis chief executive, Julia Hutchinson, said self-employed professionals needed a voice in government and she would take up issues on their behalf. Sole traders in fields such as marketing, the media, and accountancy will be targeted rather than computer specialists and trades people such as plumbers. \"Self-employed professionals are becoming an increasingly important part of general corporate life and we hope to raise their profile. We plan to work with other stakeholders like the CBI and IoD when we take up their cause, but three quarters of self-employed professionals believe they don't get any support from their trade bodies.\" Ministers needed to move quickly after a study funded by the firm showed that the number of professionals working for themselves was set to double to 3.2m over the next 10 years, she added. The firm has a marketing budget of \u00a34m and plans to sell a mix of services and products including a magazine and tax software by September. Its main rival is Elancentric. Chief executive Helen Wilkinson, a founder of the think-tank Demos, said the company had \u00a3500,000 of venture capital money to develop a service for the self-employed.

      "bodyText": "1. The cult internet song-swap service, Napster, may be forced to shut up shop today if judges in the US uphold an injunction against the company. 2. Right now, those users share music as digital MP3 files, with each user allowing others access to their personal collection. The result is the world's largest collection of free music. 3. Users can download the music on to their computers or specialised portable MP3 players. 4. The world's biggest record companies filed suit against Napster last year for failing to pay up for the music downloaded by its users. 5. Sony, Warner Music, EMI and Universal say Napster violated copyright law, and they want the site shut down. 6. A fifth company, BMG, is continuing with its lawsuit despite its parent company, Bertelsmann, doing a deal with Napster. The two are to jointly develop a subscription service that will pay copyright owners while still giving Napster's 5m users the ability to swap music. Music companies want to see all free sites replaced by paying services. 7. If the judges' decision today goes the wrong way for Napster, there's no guarantee that its users won't defect to other song swap sites, such as iMesh or Scour.com, if they're charged for songs. 8. Musicians such as Metallica have complained that free music sites are doing little more than stealing the product of their creativity. 9. But British band Chumbawamba released an internet-only single, entitled Pass it Along (MP3 Mix), to attack anti-Napster musicians for their alleged greed. 10. Either way, the future of Napster founder Shawn Fanning seems assured. After the legal fees are sorted out, Silicon Valley is sure to embrace him as the most inspired entrepreneur of his generation.",

This theme was front of mind, too, for the hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside. </p> <p>The \"battle of Seattle\" and subsequent globalisation backlash demonstrations seem to have concentrated minds in many multinationals - and it showed in Davos. While the possible fallout from the current downturn in the US economy was a constant subject for discussion, the urgent agenda for the future was the need for real and effective engagement between businesses, governments and NGOs to tackle social issues.</p> <p>This was debated in robust fashion at a special summit session, aptly titled Dialogue or Diatribe: When Business and NGOs Meet. </p> <p>Jack Greenberg, chairman of McDonald's Corporation, and Hendrik Verfaille, president of Monsanto, joined NGO leaders Thilo Bode, executive director of Greenpeace International, Pierre San\u00e9, secretary general of Amnesty International and Burkhard Gnarig, chief executive officer of the International Save the Children Alliance, in a debate which put most of the issues on the table but brought little agreement on concrete action.</p> <p>The participants' honesty was refreshing and was itself an indicator of how much the dialogue between businesses and NGOs is improving, but the NGOs present were clear that diatribe is still needed to push many multinational corporations to take action on social issues. Hendrik Verfaillie didn't shirk the issue and was upfront that Monsanto had learnt some tough lessons. \"There are commercial benefits to being a good corporate citizen and to engaging and communicating with NGOs and communities,\" he said. He acknowledged that Monsanto had miscalculated initially by not engaging with NGOs and consumer groups. Monsanto was forced to review its approach. It now has a programme of active dialogue with NGOs and other groups. What this is achieving wasn't made particularly clear. </p> <p>Mr Greenberg proposed four key principles for dialogue between businesses and NGOs - to communicate openly, listen for understanding, assume innocence in others and treat each other with respect. He recognised the huge influence and power for change held by businesses and acknowledged the need for that influence to be used positively. McDonald's, he said, was doing its very best but remains, in his view, a victim of NGO misunderstanding and sometimes disinformation.</p> <p>Thilo Bode observed that dialogue between companies and NGOs was nothing new. Companies still take the credit on occasions when, in fact, an NGO like Greenpeace has pushed them into action. This point was well-illustrated the previous night, when I heard a senior Coca-Cola executive praise the company's social responsibility programmes and achievements to the heavens, without mention of any external pressures that might have concentrated executives' minds and contributed to change. </p> <p>Mr Bode questioned whether companies really understand NGOs and expressed concern that most chief executive officers present were more concerned about the cooling of the US economy than the warming of our planet. Mr San\u00e9 argued that unless the social movement gets stronger, the 21st century could be worse than the 20th in terms of human rights abuses.</p> <p>The International Save the Children Alliance's Burkhard Gnarig went further, insisting that there are times when NGOs have to mobilise the public to reverse a corporate policy. \"We can't give up diatribe,\" he said.</p> <p>So, will talk turn to action as a result of the summit? The World Economic Forum plays a key role in bringing leading players from the business, political and NGO arenas together in creative, open and constructive dialogue. It is no accident that more NGOs were present this year than ever before. As Claude Smadja, managing director of the World Economic Forum, said: \"Amid all the uncertainties about globalisation and the IT revolution, NGOs have emerged as spokespersons for people concerned about what is happening to the quality of life and social mores. The political world has been unable to assert its role, while business is seen to be arrogant. NGOs have moved into this vacuum and become more assertive.\" </p> <p>My overall impression at Davos was that many companies are still stuck in a time warp, believing that corporate philanthropy - donating to charity - is enough. This can be likened to outsourcing the business conscience. However, many of the younger business people and social entrepreneurs who attended the forum - and the leaders of a few established companies who are staying ahead of the competition - are clear that we have to find really practical ways to fully integrate social, environmental and economic benefits in global business strategies if we are all to win. Companies have to become accountable in these three areas and they are increasingly being held to account by NGOs and others. Corporate performance must now be driven by strategies that deliver measurable positive benefits for people and the planet, as well as profits. </p> <p>Consensus on specific actions at Davos was relatively thin on the ground, with some notable, and highly commendable, exceptions. An estimated 250m children under the age of 15 are working in developing countries and almost 900m adults throughout the world are illiterate. A special taskforce, asked to identify practical initiatives with which to tackle the issue of child labour and education, set the United Nations' special September session on children as a deadline for agreeing concrete action at a global level. This is one example of dialogue which will evolve into a specific drive for action but it will take much more real and concerted action by businesses and NGOs if we are to \"bridge the divides\". </p> <p>As Kofi Annan, secretary-general of the United Nations, warned at Davos: \"If we cannot make globalisation work for all, in the end, it will work for none. The unequal distribution of benefits and the imbalances in global rule-making, which characterize globalisation today, will inevitable produce backlash and protectionism. Companies are learning that, as markets have gone global, so must the concept and practice of corporate social responsibility.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Manny Amadi is chief executive officer of Cause &amp; Effect Marketing</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Charity commissioner David Taylor's speech<br> <strong>Clear communication: changing the focus of the annual report</strong></p> <p> <strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>I am very pleased to be here, not only as an ex-chair of CFDG but especially to welcome the joint initiative of ACEVO, CFDG and ICFM. And, of course, as a charity commissioner, it gives me the opportunity to support this gathering in its efforts to promote and improve the effectiveness of the annual report as a communications instrument in support of charities. A reminder that the commission's main aim is to give the public confidence in the integrity of charity. What better starting point for me today?</p> <p>My words and thoughts embrace both the annual report and the financial statements.</p> <p> <strong>Public perceptions</strong></p> <p>Some believe that the public sees charities as fundraisers for relief of poverty, and action in support of overseas aid, animals, children and health.</p> <p>The public largely has contact with charities not as a beneficiary but as a potential source of funds. </p> <p>Assessing the value of the annual report as a trusted means of communication, our opinion surveys have consistently shown that a charity's annual report and accounts are just about the only element of a charity's information about itself that people actually trust. MORI research in 1999 showed that people appear to trust this information as much as they trust information about charities that they get from regulatory bodies like ourselves. Conversely, and perhaps predictably, there is distrust of information given out by charities in the course of their fundraising. </p> <p>You don't really need me to highlight the importance of the reputational risk to charities.</p> <p><strong>Influence of the press</strong> </p> <p>Leaving aside charities where there may be serious mismanagement or fraudulent practices, some stories damage the whole sector. This may be where the charity has failed to communicate clearly <strong>why</strong> it is doing what it is doing or fails to appreciate <strong>how</strong> all its information, both narrative and numbers, will be interpreted. How many stories of good practice get into the news, except perhaps when there is a disaster or when a skillfully managed telethon captures the passions and imagination of viewers?</p> <p>It is relevant to quote a press cutting in my in-tray. Its a quote from Andrew Watt, ICFM's head policy officer, reported in the Cardiff Western Mail: \"The fact that critics had jumped on the NSPCC's statement revealed a problem of communication rather than finance. It was important for charities to make people aware how they were spending the money because the givers were now more interested in exactly where their money went. Each individual organisation needs to be honest and open about what they are doing and why they are doing it\".</p> <p>The Financial Times followed this with: \"The NSPCC should have explained better the rationale behind its spending on marketing,\" and criticised the charity's communications policy. </p> <p>I use these quotes not to single out the NSPCC's activities, nor in any way to criticise its policies, but simply to highlight the media minefield. It highlights how the press doing its job and how the public can so easily make assumptions and influence perceptions contrary to those you would wish.</p> <p> <strong>How can we change some of these perceptions? </strong></p> <p>Clearer communication is the key. </p> <p>So, explain what you do, what has gone well, what has gone badly, what work needs to be done, the impact the charity has had in the year. Show that you appreciate any concerns of your potential audience. Donors need to understand not only that their money is well used but also that it is well protected and not wasted.</p> <p>How many times have we seen bland trustees' reports written, dare I say it here, often by accountants - who are not renowned for their flair in capturing the publics' imagination. Yet the same charity will issue a glossy brochure - the annual review - which tells the charity's story, sometimes without the numbers to explain and back up those stories, and is too late to influence potential supporters.</p> <p>There is a major communications risk with fundraising material, especially mailshots. There is a risk that trust in what charities say will be reduced. </p> <p><strong>The commission's statement of recommended practice (Sorp)</strong></p> <p>The new title, \"Accounting and reporting by charities\" was no accident. </p> <p>The commission has produced the revised Sorp, with much help from the sector itself (indeed, some of the culprits are here today) in support of clear communication. The recommended minimum requirements can be used as a very effective tool to get key messages across. However, even with the reduced \"checklist\" in the narrative section, it still remains with the authors to understand their audiences concerns, to understand the key messages that the charity wishes to convey. You must provide the balance that gives confidence and comforts readers that the charity is acting responsibly, is accountable for its actions, and is carrying out work that has a significant impact. <strong>But</strong> please don't just observe minimum requirements.</p> <p>The information needed to discharge your duty of public accountability and stewardship can be supported by imaginative and innovative design, clarity and good presentation. All are important alongside technical compliance and financial accuracy. </p> <p> <strong>The stories you need to tell</strong></p> <p>It is not possible to tell good stories in your report unless there are actually good stories to tell. If I were sitting on the trustees' or executive officers' side of the fence today, I would probably be thinking: \"What story do I want to tell in my 2002 report?\" and \"What steps do I need to make to be able to tell that story?\".

      "bodyText": "Charity commissioner David Taylor's speech Clear communication: changing the focus of the annual report Introduction I am very pleased to be here, not only as an ex-chair of CFDG but especially to welcome the joint initiative of ACEVO, CFDG and ICFM. And, of course, as a charity commissioner, it gives me the opportunity to support this gathering in its efforts to promote and improve the effectiveness of the annual report as a communications instrument in support of charities. A reminder that the commission's main aim is to give the public confidence in the integrity of charity. What better starting point for me today? My words and thoughts embrace both the annual report and the financial statements. Public perceptions Some believe that the public sees charities as fundraisers for relief of poverty, and action in support of overseas aid, animals, children and health. The public largely has contact with charities not as a beneficiary but as a potential source of funds. Assessing the value of the annual report as a trusted means of communication, our opinion surveys have consistently shown that a charity's annual report and accounts are just about the only element of a charity's information about itself that people actually trust. MORI research in 1999 showed that people appear to trust this information as much as they trust information about charities that they get from regulatory bodies like ourselves. Conversely, and perhaps predictably, there is distrust of information given out by charities in the course of their fundraising. You don't really need me to highlight the importance of the reputational risk to charities. Influence of the press Leaving aside charities where there may be serious mismanagement or fraudulent practices, some stories damage the whole sector. This may be where the charity has failed to communicate clearly why it is doing what it is doing or fails to appreciate how all its information, both narrative and numbers, will be interpreted. How many stories of good practice get into the news, except perhaps when there is a disaster or when a skillfully managed telethon captures the passions and imagination of viewers? It is relevant to quote a press cutting in my in-tray. Its a quote from Andrew Watt, ICFM's head policy officer, reported in the Cardiff Western Mail: \"The fact that critics had jumped on the NSPCC's statement revealed a problem of communication rather than finance. It was important for charities to make people aware how they were spending the money because the givers were now more interested in exactly where their money went. Each individual organisation needs to be honest and open about what they are doing and why they are doing it\". The Financial Times followed this with: \"The NSPCC should have explained better the rationale behind its spending on marketing,\" and criticised the charity's communications policy. I use these quotes not to single out the NSPCC's activities, nor in any way to criticise its policies, but simply to highlight the media minefield. It highlights how the press doing its job and how the public can so easily make assumptions and influence perceptions contrary to those you would wish. How can we change some of these perceptions? Clearer communication is the key. So, explain what you do, what has gone well, what has gone badly, what work needs to be done, the impact the charity has had in the year. Show that you appreciate any concerns of your potential audience. Donors need to understand not only that their money is well used but also that it is well protected and not wasted. How many times have we seen bland trustees' reports written, dare I say it here, often by accountants - who are not renowned for their flair in capturing the publics' imagination. Yet the same charity will issue a glossy brochure - the annual review - which tells the charity's story, sometimes without the numbers to explain and back up those stories, and is too late to influence potential supporters. There is a major communications risk with fundraising material, especially mailshots. There is a risk that trust in what charities say will be reduced. The commission's statement of recommended practice (Sorp) The new title, \"Accounting and reporting by charities\" was no accident. The commission has produced the revised Sorp, with much help from the sector itself (indeed, some of the culprits are here today) in support of clear communication. The recommended minimum requirements can be used as a very effective tool to get key messages across. However, even with the reduced \"checklist\" in the narrative section, it still remains with the authors to understand their audiences concerns, to understand the key messages that the charity wishes to convey. You must provide the balance that gives confidence and comforts readers that the charity is acting responsibly, is accountable for its actions, and is carrying out work that has a significant impact. But please don't just observe minimum requirements. The information needed to discharge your duty of public accountability and stewardship can be supported by imaginative and innovative design, clarity and good presentation. All are important alongside technical compliance and financial accuracy. The stories you need to tell It is not possible to tell good stories in your report unless there are actually good stories to tell. If I were sitting on the trustees' or executive officers' side of the fence today, I would probably be thinking: \"What story do I want to tell in my 2002 report?\" and \"What steps do I need to make to be able to tell that story?\". In other words, if the charity has good planning processes, policies and organisational structures, all of which are clearly understood, then the chances of achieving your objectives are significantly increased. Do remember that your report is not just a financial one. Non-financial performance indicators may be vitally important and interesting. Rationale for requiring statements in trustees' report \u0095 The report is where trustees focus on developments and achievements of the past year and explain future plans - it should reflect joined-up thinking and action; \u0095 The report is a narrative to be seen as a cohesive part of the \"report and accounts\" package; not a series of unrelated statements; \u0095 Demonstrate how policies fit in with organisation and how they impact upon performance; \u0095 The story told by the Sorp, balance sheet and notes (not forgetting the accounting policies) should have a seemless link with the trustees' report. For example, if we in monitoring can see that your trading subsidiary is in deep trouble, so can others. Explain it in the report. If reserves are spilling over - or appear to be - and you don't think so, the communications remedy is obvious. Accountability Accountability is perhaps the most important buzzword, alongside transparency. Demonstrate responsibility and accountability by showing: \u0095 That your charity is properly governed and managed with clear organisational structures. This can go much further than a list of people, by explaining what people do; \u0095 That charity trustees understand their responsibilities to use monies raised effectively and efficiently for the beneficiary groups; \u0095 That the charity has a clear focus on the work that needs to be done, a clear strategy for doing it, and understands the risks attached; \u0095 Openness about the principal policies. Following these precepts should at worst deflect criticism and at best help inspire public confidence. What does the charity do? In the past, we have all come across charity reports that fail to state what the charity does. I believe you should: \u0095 Clearly set out who you have helped, what help you have given and then translate this into the numbers; \u0095 Without some interpretation or measure of effectiveness it is very difficult for the reader to understand the potential impact; \u0095 Explain what the actual activities were and why they are necessary; \u0095 Explain who else you work with and why this is necessary; \u0095 Explain why it is important to have services that support the charity's work (eg head office costs) and what these contribute; \u0095 Be open about fundraising efforts, their effectiveness and the costs attached - remember the new requirements deal with this; \u0095 Explain how volunteers are used and, if appropriate, estimate their contribution. Explaining the future \u0095 What still needs to be done; \u0095 What are the strategies and plans for the forthcoming year; \u0095 What are the key risks and how will these be managed; \u0095 What are reserves going to be used for. About your audiences Remember in communicating your messages: \u0095 Who needs to and who will see the report - is it just the trustees and the commission, or is it all key stakeholders? You know the list: employees, fundraisers, volunteers, donors, grant-makers and regulators; \u0095 What about other local community groups or even the local or national press \u0095 Decide how to get these parties to read them. Do you need to do something that focuses the stakeholder so they will open up the report and accounts and have a read; \u0095 Decide how the messages can be got across in all contacts with the public. What will the commission look for? The revised Sorp pays more attention to and encourages a more intelligent trustees' report. We inspect both this report and the accounts report, but accounts and numbers are easier to produce than narrative. My additional interest, which I hope you all share, is in improving annual reports. Monitoring may raise issues such as: \u0095 Accuracy of charity details (address, objects, list of trustees, bankers, auditors, etc); \u0095 Inappropriate level of reserves or inadequate explanation of policy; \u0095 Major causes of concern; \u0095 Trustee benefits; \u0095 Related-party transactions; \u0095 Problems within trading subsidiaries; \u0095 Non-charitable trading. Note that we have over 700k hits to our website each month, of which half are searches for information on charities. With electronic submission and availability of your information online by 2005 - this will include reports and accounts - just think how many people around the world will easily and quickly be able to get the wrong end of the stick! Some conclusions The revisions to the annual report and accounts in the proposed Sorp are all about transparency and the link between them. The legal reporting and accounting framework provides the right balance between prescriptiveness and opportunity and, when well written, will provide balance on accountability and achievements. Remember: \u0095 A spirit of openness on governance, policies and performance will inspire confidence; \u0095 The charity should be planning what story it wants to tell; \u0095 The authors, not just accountants, and especially the trustees, need to know the audience; \u0095 Many stakeholders find it difficult to interpret accounts, anticipate their questions or where their understanding may be lacking; \u0095 You need to be able to persuade the public that the good you do is solid, visible and value for money; \u0095 The more charities can shift the debate away from the size of their overheads and on the value of their achievements, the better. A \"down to earth\" check-list: A colleague has generously provided me with the following: \u0095 What picture of the charity does your report paint? \u0095 Have you put in the necessary legal details? \u0095 Have you included any pictures - if you can afford them? \u0095 Have you boasted enough about what you are doing? \u0095 Have you confessed what you are not doing? \u0095 Do you need to appeal for funds and if so do you say what funds would be spent on? \u0095 Are you giving money away? If so: \u0095 have you said how you are spending it \u0095 how does this relate to your objectives? \u0095 would an applicant know what they would get money for \u0095 how do you make decisions about what to support? \u0095 Have you too little/too much reserves? \u0095 Can you justify this? \u0095 How are you going to correct over/under reserves? \u0095 Is there anyone who you need to praise, thank, beg from, butter up? \u0095 Does the report show how trustees are managing? \u0095 Have you told any stories about what you are doing? \u0095 Have you told any lies? \u0095 Have you any problems to report - especially ones you have overcome? \u0095 Can you give any statistics about how good you have been? \u0095 Have you said what the charity is doing? \u0095 David Taylor gave this speech at a joint conference by the association of chief executives of voluntary organisations (ACEVO), the charity finance directors' group (CFDG) and the institute of charity fundraising managers (ICFM), which took place on January 18, 2001",

      "bodyText": "BBC2 is winning the Saturday-night battle of the archive shows, with I Love 1983 pulling in more than double the audience of Channel 4's Top Ten Heartbreakers. I Love 1983 featured such pop-cultural delights as Roland Rat, Wham!'s Club Tropicana, hit movie Flashdance and Michael Jackson's Thriller video. The archive programme had 4m viewers and a 17% share between 9.05pm and 10.35pm, according to unofficial overnights. Despite the presence of Isaac Hayes as host, Channel 4's Top Ten Heartbreakers could muster only 1.6m viewers and a 7% share from 9.05pm to 10.40pm. I Love 1983 also beat ailing BBC1 sitcom Beast between 9.55pm and 10.25pm. The last in the series of the Simon Nye-scripted vet comedy gained just 3.5m viewers. ITV scored with the gyrating hips of Latin heartthrob Ricky Martin earlier on Saturday night. An Audience with Ricky Martin pulled in 8.6m and a 39% share from 6.30pm-7.30pm. It comfortably beat Jim Davidson's Generation Game on BBC1, which gained 6.2m. Popstars followed ITV's Ricky Martin special but, not surprisingly, could not maintain the giddy ratings heights reached last Saturday when the identities of the band were revealed. But the hit reality show still had an impressive 9.7m and 40% share between 7.30pm and 8.15pm. On Friday night, BBC1's 9pm-10pm comedy line-up of Office Gossip and Adrian Mole: the Cappuccino Years lost ground in its second week. Office Gossip, the sitcom featuring Pauline Quirke, had 5.1m, after opening with 6.3m viewers last Friday. Adrian Mole fell from 6m to 4.7m on its second outing.",

The first-quarter figures were closely watched, reflecting the status of the online booking agency as a bellweather for internet retailing in the UK. Lastminute's \u00a315.3m losses were more than double the figure for the last three months of 1999. However, they were ignored in favour of confirmation of a joint venture with offline competitor Thomas Cook. Lastminute's shares rose 3 per cent to 70.5p by mid-afternoon, although they remain far below their year high of 555p. \"Lastminute needs to move its supplier base to more traditional companies such as Thomas Cook,\" said Nick Jones, senior analyst at global internet research firm Jupiter MMXI. \"It is well established among affluent, young city dwellers but it needs to widen its appeal.\" The Thomas Cook deal will enable the travel agency's website to offer last minute deals. The companies will team up to offer a service for customers who want to book a holiday six weeks in advance. The acquisition of French online travel firm Degriftour in October last year is now seen as a shrewd move, which boosted the company's reach in time for the vital Christmas-shopping period. \"The Degriftour deal was a sensible acquisition because the weeks before and after Christmas are prime holiday-buying periods. \"The French connection has worked well,\" added Mr Jones. However, Lastminute.com has several doubters within the City, who pointed to the flat growth in subscribers and the increased operating losses. These increased from \u00a310m in the three months to September last year to \u00a316.3m. Although quarter-on-quarter turnover nearly doubled from \u00a31.48m to \u00a32.9m, some analysts said they expected a bigger boost from the Degriftour deal. \"I would have expected a rather higher increase in revenue,\" said one analyst. \"It might be that all that growth came from Degriftour, which would tell you something about the underlying business. \"And the amount of money they are spending to generate \u00a32.9m in revenue is worrying.\" Lastminute still has the envious asset of a healthy cash balance, thanks to a successful flotation in March last year.

Mr Smith has appointed Law professor Richard Whish to lead the review of the BBC's commercial policies and fair trading rules. He will look in particular at whether there is enough separation between the BBC's public service operations and commercial arm BBC Worldwide. Mr Smith told the Financial Times: \"There must be a firm wall between licence fee-funded activity - which must be part of the public service responsibilities for a domestic audience - and commercial activities which must be funded commercially and make a commercial return.\" The other two reviews will take place after the general election, which is expected to be called for early May. The review of BBC Online follows complaints from commercial broadcasters and internet publishers that the corporation is competing unfairly. BSkyB has long argued that News 24, which the BBC gives away to pay-TV operators for free, provides unfair competition for its own news channel Sky News. News of the new government reviews of the BBC comes on the day of the deadline for submissions about the communications white paper. The BBC said it had no comment to make immediately.",

Britain has the lowest inflation rate of any EU country, and its long term borrowing rates are well within the rules.

Even though currencies have been allowed more latitude to fluctuate within the ERM since 1992, there is no way that the pound meets the stability rule. Britain argues that, as the ERM effectively had to be recreated after the 1992 debacle - the Italian lira and the Finnish markka were both ejected along with the pound, and the other currencies were allowed to move around by as much as 15% - the condition no longer applies.

The IMF said recently that, if British interest rates had been as low as European ones over the last seven years, the government would have been forced to raise taxes or cut spending in order to curb inflation. The fund doubts whether UK and European business cycles will converge naturally in the short term.

The Newcastle-based agency has called in accountancy firm RMT and convened a meeting of creditors for February 22. Liquidators may be appointed at the meeting. There is also believed to be another company ready to take over the ailing agency. No-one at the agency was available for comment but a spokesman for RMT confirmed the crisis meeting was taking place. Last year AD78 restructured and moved to bigger offices. However, in December managing director Alex Giles quit along with creative director Dean Rutter and two other staff. The breakaway group has now set up a rival agency called Lateral Advertising. AD78 shot to fame last month when it placed a job ad for an account handler and asked applicants to send in a topless photo along with their CVs. The story was covered in several national newspapers. In the face of criticism from the TUC, which said the ad potentially breached sexual discrimination law, agency chairman David Buckle said: \"We asked for a topless photo just to see how far people were prepared to go. \"We want people who are prepared to go the extra yard and we thought this would be a challenge.\" AD78 takes its name from the year it was formed - 1978. It has a turnover of around \u00a3300,000 and clients include the GMB trade union, for which it recently ran a campaign to raise awareness of new workers rights.",

      "bodyText": "The government-backed anti-violence \"young, gifted and dead\" campaign has been taken down after scores of the posters were vandalised and families of shooting victims complained. The hard-hitting posters form part of the \"not another drop\" anti-gun campaign, run by the Metropolitan police and Brent council and backed by the Home Office. It was launched less than two weeks ago in Brent, north-west London. Brent has one of the highest rates of shootings in Britain. The shocking image on the posters shows a man lying in a pool of blood under the words \"Young, gifted and dead\". Up to 60 of the posters have been covered in super-adhesive white paint. A Brent Council spokesman said all the posters have been removed following the vandalism and after families of a number of shooting victims made complaints. He added the campaign against gun crime would continue and was being backed by the Home Office and senior police. When the campaign launched it was greeted with dismay by some community groups. Friends of the Family, a Christian evangelical group, said the campaign would distress victims' families. Commander Mike Fuller, who heads the Met's Operation Trident - which tackles gun violence in London - also expressed reservations about the posters, saying they could heighten the fear of crime in the community. The police took the radical step of advertising the campaign on pirate radio in an attempt to reach the target audience.",

Pipe bombs have been used in more than 50 sectarian attacks on Roman Catholic homes in the province this year alone. They are thoroughly nasty devices, in which pieces of scrap metal are packed with blasting powder extracted from fireworks or shotgun cartridges, then welded up to contain and therefore maximise the blast. At least three pipe bomb attacks have been reported in the past 24 hours, in Belfast and County Antrim. There was also an overnight shotgun attack on a house in Belfast. Police discovered the bombmaking factory in a raid on three flats in a northern part of the city known to be a hotbed of support for the Ulster Volunteer Force. But most of the attacks have been attributed to the UVF's deadly rivals, the Ulster Defence Association. Both groups are notionally committed to a ceasefire, but have been engaged in a bloody feud which has claimed at least seven lives. The rumbling violence has further undermined public confidence in a peace process now utterly bogged down in mutual recrimination between the Ulster Unionists and republican Sinn Fein. According to weekend reports, Unionist leader and first minister in the beleaguered power-sharing executive, David Trimble, has warded off renewed hardline criticism from within his own party, by reinforcing sanctions against Sinn Fein members of his own administration. One report says he will exclude them from future meetings of the cross-border Irish council. Another says he will withdraw his Unionist ministers from the council. The new sanctions are intended to force Sinn Fein to put pressure on the Provisional IRA to start disarming. The republicans claim that it is the British government, not themselves, who should make the first move towards \"demilitarising\" the province. Meanwhile, in the gloomiest assessment to date of the faltering peace, an independent observer from South Africa has pronounced that the Good Friday process has failed in its present form, and should be started again from scratch. Roelf Meyer, a former minister who played a leading part in the negotiations which ended apartheid, said that the current institutions should be suspended while new talks are set up.

      "bodyText": "The BBC has welcomed three government inquiries due to examine the relationship between its commercial and public service activities. The corporation was responding to a newspaper interview with Chris Smith. The culture secretary talked about a review into whether the BBC is using licence-fee money to subsidise its commercial activities plus separate inquires into BBC Online and News 24. Mr Smith has appointed law professor Richard Whish to lead the review of the BBC's commercial policies and fair trading rules. Mr Whish will look in particular at whether there is enough separation between the BBC's public service operations and commercial arm BBC Worldwide. Commenting on the inquiry into the separation of its public service and commercial activity, a BBC spokesman said: \"This independent review has been expected since the recommendations of the Davies report in 1999 and the secretary of state's comments following the licence fee settlement last year. \"We welcome it. \"The BBC has worked hard to stay at the leading edge of best practice in our fair trading arrangements,\" the spokesman added. \"We look forward to working with professor Whish and benefiting from his expertise in this field.\" Mr Smith told the Financial Times: \"There must be a firm wall between licence fee-funded activity - which must be part of the public service responsibilities for a domestic audience - and commercial activities, which must be funded commercially and make a commercial return.\" The other two reviews will take place after the general election, which is expected to take place in early May. The review of BBC Online follows complaints from commercial broadcasters and internet publishers that the corporation is competing unfairly. BSkyB has long argued that News 24, which the BBC gives away to pay-TV operators for free, provides unfair competition for its own news channel Sky News. News of the new government reviews of the BBC comes on the day of the deadline for submissions about the communications white paper. Relevant story 9am: Government to investigate BBC",

The deal, worth an undisclosed sum, gives 5 Live exclusive UK radio rights to formula one from 2002-2005. It was secured in the face of a rival bids, said a 5 Live spokesman. Yet a spokesman from commercial station Talk Sport, which is owned by Kelvin MacKenzie's Wireless Group, said the station did not make a bid. As well as live race coverage, 5 Live will launch a preview show, fronted by motor racing correspondent Jonathan Legard. Jonathan Legard's World of Formula One will air on the night before each Grand Prix. \"The show will be along similar lines to Jonathan Agnew's World of Cricket and Jeremy Guscott's World of Rugby, in which seasoned commentators are bought together on location in the run-up to big events,\" said a 5 Live spokesman. Bob Shennan, 5 Live controller, added: \"Jonathan and the 5 Live approach to formula one has spawned a strong following among fans. \"We're delighted to recieve this vote of confidence in the way we cover the sport.\" Bernie Ecclestone, managing director of motor racing rights owner Formula One Management, said: \"The massive radio following for formula one has been very well served by BBC Radio 5 Live in the UK. \"When something works that well, it's best left in place.\" The BBC has hung on the the radio rights to formula one, despite losing the TV rights to ITV in 1997.",

      "bodyText": "Coca-Cola has axed Barbara Becker from its advertising following her messy divorce from her former tennis ace husband. Ms Becker was to appear in a German TV commercial for Coca-Cola Caffeine Free. However, the advert has been pulled because Coke believes her appearance would \"distract viewers from the brand message\". Ms Becker - who has custody of the couple's two children and has started a new relationship - is thought to no longer fit Coke's desired \"family image\". Coke's German agency Springer &amp; Jacoby said it had replaced the commercial filmed with Ms Becker with new adverts featuring \"everyday families\". The Beckers recently divorced in a settlement reportedly worth \u00a315m. The split followed a multi-million-pound paternity suit, filed against Mr Becker by Russian-born model Angela Ermakova. Ermakova claimed she became pregnant after a one-off tryst with Mr Becker in the broom cupboard of upmarket London restaurant Nobu. Mr Becker has his own advertising contracts with AOL Germany and Mercedes Benz. The tagline he made famous for AOL - \"I am in\" - is now, combined with his domestic situation, the subject of jokes in Germany.",

Many more refugees remain trapped in camps where relief workers have been unable to reach them since September.</p> <p>\"I call here on the government of Guinea to give us assistance to provide for the security of the refugees who are fleeing,\" Mr Lubbers said yesterday at the Massakoundou camp, just outside Kissidougou. \"We need a corridor of security and safety for refugees and humanitarian workers.\"</p> <p>One of the world's poorest nations, Guinea has one of Africa's largest refugee populations, including 122,000 Liberians who fled their country's seven-year civil war which ended in 1996, and 330,000 Sierra Leoneans who have fled almost ten years of fighting by rebels of the Revolutionary United Front.</p> <p>Since September, 200,000 of the refugees have been on the move inside Guinea's forests after fighting broke out on the borders with Liberia and Sierra Leone. About 22,000 Sierra Leoneans have returned home, often to equally perilous conditions.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the UNHCR began relocating refugees from the border areas to a new camp at Albadaria, 110 miles to the north. But UNHCR officials say they are hampered by security concerns, insufficient trucks and the difficult terrain. Many refugees have fled on foot behind a UNHCR convoy.</p> <p>By Saturday, some 20,000 of them had sought refuge at Katkama, a former camp looted and partially destroyed during fighting in December. Exhausted families sat surrounded by bundles of possessions as Lubbers, a former Dutch prime minister who was appointed to his UN post last month, toured the camp yesterday.</p> <p>A few makeshift shelters made of branches and plastic sheeting had been erected, but many people were sleeping in the open as they waited for UN trucks to take them further away from the border.</p> <p>\"They are too slow,\" complained Kamoba Daramy, a 42-year-old Sierra Leonean who has fled two refugee camps nearer the border in the past three days. \"We want (the UNHCR) to hurry up because all around here is a rebel zone.\"</p> <p>Guinean officials fear rebel fighters could be concealed among the refugees and want a slow relocation so they can conduct roadside searches. Refugees complain these searches often turn into violent shakedowns and many lose what few possessions they have left.</p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4126249,00.html\">29.01.2001: Refugees stuck in Africa's unseen war zone</a><br></p> <p><b>Related special report</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sierra/\" target=\"_new\">Sierra Leone</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.unhcr.ch/\" target=\"_new\">UNHCR</a><br> <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/\" target=\"_new\">Africa news online</a><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Tens of thousands of refugees from Sierra Leone and Liberia were facing another day of uncertainty today as the UN refugee chief tried to find a political solution to ensure their safe passage from the fighting in the dense rainforests of Guinea. The UN high commissioner for refugees, Ruud Lubbers, has appealed for a \"safe corridor\" to enable the refugees, who had fled to Guinea to escape conflict in their own countries, to escape the deteriorating security situation along Guinea's southern borders with Liberia and Sierra Leone. Mr Lubbers arrived in Guinea on Saturday at the start of a nine-day west African tour and visited two camps near the southwestern town of Kissidougou, where the refugees from Sierra Leone and Liberia have sought shelter. Many more refugees remain trapped in camps where relief workers have been unable to reach them since September. \"I call here on the government of Guinea to give us assistance to provide for the security of the refugees who are fleeing,\" Mr Lubbers said yesterday at the Massakoundou camp, just outside Kissidougou. \"We need a corridor of security and safety for refugees and humanitarian workers.\" One of the world's poorest nations, Guinea has one of Africa's largest refugee populations, including 122,000 Liberians who fled their country's seven-year civil war which ended in 1996, and 330,000 Sierra Leoneans who have fled almost ten years of fighting by rebels of the Revolutionary United Front. Since September, 200,000 of the refugees have been on the move inside Guinea's forests after fighting broke out on the borders with Liberia and Sierra Leone. About 22,000 Sierra Leoneans have returned home, often to equally perilous conditions. On Tuesday, the UNHCR began relocating refugees from the border areas to a new camp at Albadaria, 110 miles to the north. But UNHCR officials say they are hampered by security concerns, insufficient trucks and the difficult terrain. Many refugees have fled on foot behind a UNHCR convoy. By Saturday, some 20,000 of them had sought refuge at Katkama, a former camp looted and partially destroyed during fighting in December. Exhausted families sat surrounded by bundles of possessions as Lubbers, a former Dutch prime minister who was appointed to his UN post last month, toured the camp yesterday. A few makeshift shelters made of branches and plastic sheeting had been erected, but many people were sleeping in the open as they waited for UN trucks to take them further away from the border. \"They are too slow,\" complained Kamoba Daramy, a 42-year-old Sierra Leonean who has fled two refugee camps nearer the border in the past three days. \"We want (the UNHCR) to hurry up because all around here is a rebel zone.\" Guinean officials fear rebel fighters could be concealed among the refugees and want a slow relocation so they can conduct roadside searches. Refugees complain these searches often turn into violent shakedowns and many lose what few possessions they have left.

      "bodyText": "London mayor Ken Livingstone has backed down on his weighty budget demands in the face of opposition from the capital's councils and assembly. With the London assembly threatening to slash millions from his first budget, Mr Livingstone has suggested scaling back the proposed increase to the average band D council tax from \u00a338 to \u00a328 per year. The move will be welcomed by London's boroughs, which were anxious that the original precept proposals would force band D council tax up by around 5% - on top of which councils would have to add increases to pay for frontline services. Mr Livingstone said he had \"gone the extra mile to listen and seek compromise and agreement\" with the assembly in his final draft budget. He has now conceded to almost all the assembly's proposed cuts, including \u00a39.3m in efficiency savings from the metropolitan police budget. But Mr Livingstone has remained defiant on the transport budget. The assembly had called on the mayor to cut the entire \u00a323.6m increase for Transport for London (TfL) which was destined to form the organisation's reserves. Mr Livingstone now wants an increase of just over \u00a310m. He said: \"The transport budget I am proposing is the absolute minimum needed to ensure London gets the full programme of planned transport improvement and to safeguard the financial position of TfL. I still believe my original plans were a better and more secure option - delivering the programme will now need especially careful management but I have put the objective of achieving consensus first.\" Assembly budget committee chairwoman Baroness Sally Hamwee said the met and TfL budgets could be \"clearer and tighter\". Last week metropolitan police commissioner Sir John Stevens and transport commissioner Bob Kiley pleaded with the assembly not to force them into a financial juggling act by calling for swinging cuts. Mr Livingstone has also accepted a proposed \u00a32.318m cut to money earmarked for core Greater London authority services such as cultural initiatives and health monitoring. He intends to manage these cuts by keeping a tight control of staffing and closely timing the introduction of new initiatives. The mayor presents his final draft budget to the assembly on February 15 and will have to give reasons if he has not included amendments it previously suggested.

      "bodyText": "Interactive TV games company Two Way TV has signed up its first external games developer. The company is gearing up to launch a fully fledged interactive TV channel on ONdigital in the next two months. Two Way TV has joined forces with leading games developer Infogrames to co-produce games for the ONdigital Two Way TV channel. Infogrames already makes games for Warner Bros and Paramount and has recently bought Hasbro Interactive. The purchase allows it to produce digital versions of Hasbro board games, such as Monopoly, Scrabble and Risk. The deal with Two Way TV will enable Infogrames develop a number of puzzle-based games for the channel. It is expected to lead to the development of interactive board games for Two Way TV. It is also thought the tie-up with Infogrames will lead to further games partnerships with Two Way TV on other platforms. Gilles Lioret, head of the I.Lights department at Infogrames, said: \"Working with Two Way TV will bring our games to a new audience and will strengthen our brand within the digital entertainment market.\" In a bid to build its profile, Infogrames has recently started adding its brand name to ads for its games. Last month, Two Way TV underwent a cost-cutting exercise in which 30 jobs were axed. A further 12 staff are in the process of negotiating \"sabbaticals\" or part-time contracts.",

The merger of the two famous British studios has been largely welcomed by the industry which sees it as a chance to attract more major film-makers. British studios have suffered in recent years as Hollywood producers have found complexes in mainland Europe, especially eastern Europe, Canada and Australia cheaper and more flexible. It is hoped that the merger will redress the balance. One drawback is that the spaces are so far apart, which could cause logistical difficulties. The former Channel 4 chief executive Michael Grade became chairman of Pinewood Studios, best known as the home of the James Bond series, last February after his bidding group bought the business from Rank for \u00a362m. Since 1995 Shepperton had been owned by a consortium, including Ridley Scott, director of Gladiator, his brother Tony and the private equity company Candover. There were suggestions that Candover had been pushing for the sale of Shepperton to realise the return on its investment and it was thought that the Scott brothers were preparing to take the business public. But then it became clear that Mr Grade was keen to merge the two studios. Details of the deal remain sketchy but it is thought that the Scott brothers will continue to play key roles, perhaps as senior managers. Their presence will boost the artistic integrity of the new operation. It is also thought that senior industry figures such as Lord Attenborough and Lord Puttnam have been sounded out about the plans. The merger comes at a good time for the British industry.

Channel East, which was set up early last year, has scaled back programme production from 25 programmes to around seven. Channel East's boss Pom Bhabra said he cut the channel's staff rosters from 120 to 26 over a period of about nine months because most production staff \"simply weren't performing\". He blamed most of the channel's problems on \"lax\" staff, too many of whom \"want to work for a quick buck, rather than working to a deadline\". But broadcasting union Bectu says the satellite channel has been blacklisted after problems with staff payment and working conditions. And many former staff at the channel have told MediaGuardian.co.uk they waited months for pay, leading, in at least one case, to industrial tribunals. Staff have told of working in \"sweatshop\" conditions at the channel. One employee alleged people returning from lunch would have their breath checked to see whether they had been drinking. Mr Bhabra denies the allegations. Another staff member said he was accused by a senior manager of stealing batteries that he had purchased for production purposes. Bectu supervisory official Sharon Elliott confirmed the company was on Bectu's \"ask first\" list - a list of persistent non-payers - after a string of complaints. \"Over the past 18 months, I have dealt with a number of members working for this company who have not been paid or have had contracts terminated under unusual circumstances,\" she said. She confirmed one case had gone to an industrial tribunal and at least another two had been settled before they reached that stage. She added Bectu was concerned about poor treatment of staff at cable and satellite channels across the board. \"It has been our experience that cable and satellite companies are less good at honouring their employer obligations than terrestrial TV organisations,\" she said. Mr Bhabra argued Bectu was failing to \"look at both sides of the story\".",

      "body": "<p>Before I intrude on Mr Richard Desmond's grief, a word about the new circulation chart, which is making its second appearance. To recap, the first three columns reflect a truer picture of newspaper sales by omitting bulks - the papers sold at a fraction of their cover price to hotels, fast food outlets, betting shops and airlines, which are then distributed free to customers. </p> <p>I was uncertain whether the change was such a good idea until an editor told me that one of his senior managers had called the exercise \"spectacularly unhelpful\". In other words, the chart was exposing a practice that management would rather remain concealed. </p> <p>An independent critic pointed out that some papers that are less reliant on bulks use other sleight-of-hand measures, such as discounting and cheap pre-paid subscriptions. True, but I believe the conscious act of purchase makes it more likely that the buyer will read the paper. </p> <p>I also happily admit that most people handed a free copy when getting on a plane will probably read it in some depth, but these are one-off, casual readers. To equate them with six-times-a-week, home-delivered buyers is nonsense. Nor can we be sure of the level of interest of readership among hotel guests or punters. </p> <p>Anyway, the die is cast. The main chart comparisons, contrasting year-on-year sales, continue in their unbulked format. The fourth column shows the figures with bulks, as does the six-monthly averages. This allows everyone to get as clear a picture as possible. </p> <p>Nothing springs so obviously to the eye this month as the figures for the two Express titles. The Daily Express's fall below 1m sets all sorts of records. I believe it to be the paper's lowest sale since June 1924, a period in which Beaverbrook was forced to discourage sales from rising because publishing more was costing him too much money. </p> <p>The same cannot be said now. Indeed, let us not forget that the new owner, Richard Desmond, promised to increase distribution. My inquiries suggest that he never even attempted to fulfil that pledge. Returns have been running at higher levels than his circulation department has known since one of Desmond's foolish predecessors, Lord Stevens, decided to merge the Daily Star and Sunday Sport in 1987. </p> <p>That analogy is apt. The Star's readers and advertisers deserted in their thousands because Stevens's joint deal with the pornographer David Sullivan resulted in tasteless content, and the paper's already shaky editorial credibility nose-dived. </p> <p>This time, there can only be one reason for the desertion: a combination of general publicity about Desmond's pornographic businesses and the specific targeting of Express buyers by the Daily Mail, asking whether they are happy buying a pornographer's paper. </p> <p>Although the Express has been on the slide for months, edging ever closer to the million, the sudden plunge cannot be anything to do with the paper itself. It was adequate enough in Rosie Boycott's last two months and the new editor, Chris Williams, has done a good job since he took over a couple of weeks ago. </p> <p>It is noticeable that the great beneficiary of the Express's fall has been the Mail, which sold over 5% more copies in January than in the same month a year ago. The Express was down by more than 6%. </p> <p>Failure to promote the paper in January was another crucial error and illustrates an unpalatable truth about the new owner's lack of knowledge. Forget Desmond's other activities for a moment and ask the basic newspaper industry questions the rest of Fleet Street is asking: does he know what he is doing? Has he any idea what he has got himself into? Has he got a strategy for recovery? </p> <p>Time isn't on his side. Both circu lation and advertising revenue, already low, will fall dramatically as sales decline in the coming months. </p> <p>Of course, he can cut costs. He can swing the axe, sacking journalists by the dozen. He can save on paper clips. None of that, no matter how skilful Williams turns out to be, will stop the circulation rot. </p> <p>What the paper requires is commitment, investment and, most of all, understanding. On the evidence of his first 10 weeks as proprietor, Desmond is the wrong owner. In selling to him, Clive Hollick has done a disservice to the newspaper industry and he should wipe the smirk off his face at having pulled off a financial coup. </p> <p>His lack of involvement during his tenure is more to blame for the paper's falling sales than Desmond's. Perhaps his greatest contribution to its decline was the clumsy merging of the Daily with the Sunday Express. </p> <p>That kind of union manifestly failed to work at the two Telegraphs, yet Hollick encouraged a former Telegraph executive who had witnessed the failure - Stephen Grabiner - to oversee a similar merger at the Express. Was any paper ever subjected to such ruthless cynicism? </p> <p>Look at the result: the resources-starved Sunday Express is selling 926,000, down more than 9% on a year ago. It is a paper without soul, without stories, without reason. I do not doubt that its journalists exert themselves and I do not criticise them. But they are going through the motions. No editor, not even the very best, can do the job unless the owner cares. </p> <p>It would be churlish though not to point to one remarkable success within Ludgate House: the continuing sales success of the Daily Star. Editor Peter Hill and his deputy, Hugh Whittow, have managed to increase circulation by almost 8% in the past year. The volume is small, but to arrest decline in this market is some feat, especially since its use of bulks is negligible. </p> <p>The problem for Williams and his journalists is that Desmond may read too much into the Star's ability to retain a British sale of 540,000 with a tiny staff.

      "bodyText": "Before I intrude on Mr Richard Desmond's grief, a word about the new circulation chart, which is making its second appearance. To recap, the first three columns reflect a truer picture of newspaper sales by omitting bulks - the papers sold at a fraction of their cover price to hotels, fast food outlets, betting shops and airlines, which are then distributed free to customers. I was uncertain whether the change was such a good idea until an editor told me that one of his senior managers had called the exercise \"spectacularly unhelpful\". In other words, the chart was exposing a practice that management would rather remain concealed. An independent critic pointed out that some papers that are less reliant on bulks use other sleight-of-hand measures, such as discounting and cheap pre-paid subscriptions. True, but I believe the conscious act of purchase makes it more likely that the buyer will read the paper. I also happily admit that most people handed a free copy when getting on a plane will probably read it in some depth, but these are one-off, casual readers. To equate them with six-times-a-week, home-delivered buyers is nonsense. Nor can we be sure of the level of interest of readership among hotel guests or punters. Anyway, the die is cast. The main chart comparisons, contrasting year-on-year sales, continue in their unbulked format. The fourth column shows the figures with bulks, as does the six-monthly averages. This allows everyone to get as clear a picture as possible. Nothing springs so obviously to the eye this month as the figures for the two Express titles. The Daily Express's fall below 1m sets all sorts of records. I believe it to be the paper's lowest sale since June 1924, a period in which Beaverbrook was forced to discourage sales from rising because publishing more was costing him too much money. The same cannot be said now. Indeed, let us not forget that the new owner, Richard Desmond, promised to increase distribution. My inquiries suggest that he never even attempted to fulfil that pledge. Returns have been running at higher levels than his circulation department has known since one of Desmond's foolish predecessors, Lord Stevens, decided to merge the Daily Star and Sunday Sport in 1987. That analogy is apt. The Star's readers and advertisers deserted in their thousands because Stevens's joint deal with the pornographer David Sullivan resulted in tasteless content, and the paper's already shaky editorial credibility nose-dived. This time, there can only be one reason for the desertion: a combination of general publicity about Desmond's pornographic businesses and the specific targeting of Express buyers by the Daily Mail, asking whether they are happy buying a pornographer's paper. Although the Express has been on the slide for months, edging ever closer to the million, the sudden plunge cannot be anything to do with the paper itself. It was adequate enough in Rosie Boycott's last two months and the new editor, Chris Williams, has done a good job since he took over a couple of weeks ago. It is noticeable that the great beneficiary of the Express's fall has been the Mail, which sold over 5% more copies in January than in the same month a year ago. The Express was down by more than 6%. Failure to promote the paper in January was another crucial error and illustrates an unpalatable truth about the new owner's lack of knowledge. Forget Desmond's other activities for a moment and ask the basic newspaper industry questions the rest of Fleet Street is asking: does he know what he is doing? Has he any idea what he has got himself into? Has he got a strategy for recovery? Time isn't on his side. Both circu lation and advertising revenue, already low, will fall dramatically as sales decline in the coming months. Of course, he can cut costs. He can swing the axe, sacking journalists by the dozen. He can save on paper clips. None of that, no matter how skilful Williams turns out to be, will stop the circulation rot. What the paper requires is commitment, investment and, most of all, understanding. On the evidence of his first 10 weeks as proprietor, Desmond is the wrong owner. In selling to him, Clive Hollick has done a disservice to the newspaper industry and he should wipe the smirk off his face at having pulled off a financial coup. His lack of involvement during his tenure is more to blame for the paper's falling sales than Desmond's. Perhaps his greatest contribution to its decline was the clumsy merging of the Daily with the Sunday Express. That kind of union manifestly failed to work at the two Telegraphs, yet Hollick encouraged a former Telegraph executive who had witnessed the failure - Stephen Grabiner - to oversee a similar merger at the Express. Was any paper ever subjected to such ruthless cynicism? Look at the result: the resources-starved Sunday Express is selling 926,000, down more than 9% on a year ago. It is a paper without soul, without stories, without reason. I do not doubt that its journalists exert themselves and I do not criticise them. But they are going through the motions. No editor, not even the very best, can do the job unless the owner cares. It would be churlish though not to point to one remarkable success within Ludgate House: the continuing sales success of the Daily Star. Editor Peter Hill and his deputy, Hugh Whittow, have managed to increase circulation by almost 8% in the past year. The volume is small, but to arrest decline in this market is some feat, especially since its use of bulks is negligible. The problem for Williams and his journalists is that Desmond may read too much into the Star's ability to retain a British sale of 540,000 with a tiny staff. Express readers demand greater authority and a wider news agenda than the Star's audience. If he cuts the Express editorial team down to the Star's level, prepare for meltdown. As for the rest of the figures in the monthly chart, note the Sun's continued improvement and the Mirror's failure to compete. Observe also the Sunday Telegraph's disturbing down-turn and its daily stablemate's failure to stay above 1m. The Express is not the only paper facing a difficult time in the months ahead.",

Britvic wants to double the combined value of the Orchid brands to \u00a332m within five years. It hopes to increase awareness of the brands among consumers and develop distribution. To date, the brands have not been supported by a significant media spend. An advertising and promotional campaign for Ame will kick off in May. The campaign will include press and poster ads and a national sampling programme. The brand will also be promoted to the on-trade, as the drink can be used as a non-alcoholic alternative to wine. Purdey's will launch an advertising campaign from May and a sampling programme will run in cities across the country. The brand is well known in London and the south-east but Britvic wants to extend its reach. Aqua Libra will have new packaging from August supported by a PR campaign. The company wants to broaden the appeal of the drink to a wider range of health-conscious consumers. Creative work will be handled by Barrett Cernis with media planning and buying by MindShare. Sampling will be undertaken by Triangle. \"Adults make up 70 per cent of the population and currently consume almost half of all soft drinks,\" says Britvic category director Andrew Marsden. \"Per capita consumption is growing and, most importantly, adults control 80 per cent of spending. \"We regard adults as a key sector to grow the whole soft drinks category.\"",

Perhaps, like Old Mother S, Mr Murdoch expected the world to have come to an end by now. </p> <p>Knocked off his stride by the puzzling new paradigms of the internet economy, and dogged by the expense of turning his analogue satellite system into a digital platform, the last time Murdoch completed a major acquisition was with the purchase of Star TV in August 1993. But now he's back, and this time it's global. The mooted $70bn merger between Sky and DirecTV has been on the brink of completion for some time. Both sides are able to say that talks are ongoing, neither is able to say when they might conclude. But what is clear is that Rupert Murdoch really, really wants this deal. </p> <p>DirecTV has a relatively small - for the US - satellite customer base of 10m, but its attraction is that it puts the final piece in a global pay-TV jigsaw for Murdoch. With Sky TV in Britain and Star TV in the far east, DirecTV is an ambitious but logical target for Murdoch. Whilst the numbers involved are not inconsiderable, the dull business of Scart socket compatibility and the ultimate achievement of having matching set-top boxes in three major markets seems to have the \"Murdoch effect\" of shaking an industry to its very core. </p> <p>But in many ways the DirecTV deal does represent a very significant milestone. It is Murdoch nail ing his colours, not to the swaying mast of HMS Internet, but to the tug-boat of interactive TV. He is making a play that goes directly against where other global players are putting their money. Vivendi is betting on the mobile internet being the key to content in the future, whilst AOL-Time Warner is similarly committed to broadband internet access via cable. </p> <p>It is not surprising that Murdoch and his sleeping partner Bill Gates, who is putting $5bn behind the bar for the DirecTV deal, have looked for an alternative to the internet. Both men very much lost their bearings when confronted with the anarchic state of cyberspace. Bill G underestimated its effect and wound up being pummelled by the anti-trust police having tried to corral the internet onto his browser. For Murdoch it has been an even more worrying experience. To call News Corp's new media adventures a dog's breakfast would be to invite a lawsuit from the manufacturers of Pedigree Chum. For a man who is renowned for his evasion of regulation, Murdoch's businesses actually thrive by using rules to their advantage. Encouraged by his children and his new wife, Murdoch started to believe some of the hype rather than sticking to his own original and entirely correct analysis: the internet companies were, by and large, hideously over-valued. </p> <p>He declared his love for Soft Bank, the Japanese internet investor, which turned into one of the biggest dot.com casualties. So to find Murdoch retreating to TV is hardly a surprise. But it is a risk. BSkyB needs to up its income-per-digital-subscriber from \u00a3286 to \u00a3400 for 2005. Star TV's losses have been substantially cut, but the ink is still red. For interactive TV to provide the kind of fatted calf News Corp thinks it ought to, consumers will have to get used to using their TVs to spend money. In BSkyB's results last week interactivity provided \u00a337m of revenue - of which \u00a333m was from betting.

      "body": "<p>It hardly seems the best of times to start a news website when media behemoths such as News International and CNN are curtailing their internet operations. It seems positively foolhardy in the extreme when your last venture was bankrupted after a blazing libel trial. Last March, LM, the magazine formerly known as Living Marxism, closed after losing a libel action brought by ITN over an article in which the publication accused the broadcaster of misrepresenting one of the most harrowing images of the Bosnian war.</p> <p>The photo, published in papers around the world, including the Guardian, showed an emaciated Muslim, Fikret Alic, enclosed behind barbed wire at the Trnopolje camp in northern Bosnia. In fact, the wire had surrounded the ITN crew. Nevertheless, the jury accepted that the camp was - contrary to what LM suggested - a prison, and therefore the ITN pictures had not distorted the truth. The jury awarded \u00a3375,000 in damages to ITN and reporters Penny Marshall and Ian Williams. </p> <p>Mick Hume, LM editor, and Helene Guldberg, its publisher, were personally liable for the damages and the legal costs of \u00a3500,000. They have been living under the spectre of bankruptcy for the past three years. But some time this month - the date is deliberately vague - Hume and Guldberg are making a comeback online. Spiked-online.com will be LM and more. </p> <p>Hume and Guldberg have seized on the demise of LM as an opportunity to recreate in cyberspace what was a libertarian voice in print. Guldberg says LM supporters urged her and Hume to try to find a way of carrying on somehow. At the time, when internet mania was at its height, going online must have seemed the obvious answer. Now things are bleak, but nevertheless, Spiked, based in the new media enclave of Farringdon Road, will be going online 'for those who want to see some change in the real world as well as the virtual one'. </p> <p>Hume, 41, who is also a columnist for the Times, says the audience for Spiked will be the \"intelligent, maverick type\" and believes that there will be a market for the online magazine in Europe and the US. For Hume and his team of four journalists, Spiked will be a bigger and better LM, untrammelled by the distribution problems that can hamper a controversial magazine. Hume is particularly optimistic about winning eyeballs in the US, despite the online presence of established niche players such as Mother Jones, the Nation and Salon. </p> <p>LM made a name for itself by offering views not normally associated with the left. It pushed the line that society is too squeamish about scientific research and that concern over GM foods and biotechnology, for example, bordered on hysteria. LM also pooh-poohed the political preoccupation with child-rearing, crime and health. </p> <p>A piece on child safety by Guldberg, Spiked's managing editor, typifies the site's contrarian-libertarian take on the world. She rubbishes the obsession with child safety. Despite a Guardian/ICM poll released last August showing that 79% of parents believe the world is more dangerous for children, she argues that children in fact are healthier, wealthier, safer and better educated than ever. In obsessing about the need to keep children safe, 'we risk denying them the freedom they need to develop, to grow up. And this has its own, very real dangers', she writes. </p> <p>LM sank because it pushed the boat out too far on the Bosnian war, so will Spiked be more cautious? Hume says he always hesitates before running really contentious stuff anywhere and after three years with the LM case has \"no wish to waste another moment of my life with libel lawyers. But I hope that, if we believe that something is true and important, we will still publish it.\"</p> <p>Interestingly, Hume says the problem with the article about the Bosnian war photo was not that it was wrong per se, but in how it was presented: \"I am sure I could edit that same article today in such a way that even Mr Justice Morland could not object to it.\" </p> <p>For Hume and Goldberg, Spiked took their minds off the threat of bankruptcy that has dogged them ever since the start of the ITN libel case almost four years ago. They started to put it together at the beginning of last year, relying on the network that sustained LM. It took the relatively small amount of \u00a3100,000 to cobble together the venture, thanks to the brains and sweat of volunteers. Hume is cagey about the identity of investors, saying only that it came from people who made money early on in the internet boom. </p> <p>In the long term, Spiked will count on advertising, but also on sponsorship for seminars and conferences that also ran alongside LM. They will need a fair amount of money as they plan audio and video streaming for the site, functions that will not come cheap. But then LM's survival always seemed puzzling from a financial point of view, so Hume and Guldberg may be able to pull off the same trick online. None of their assets is in Spiked so the venture is out of reach of any bankruptcy proceedings. Now all they have to do is stay out of the libel courts. Although LM lost the ITN case, Hume clearly believes he and his colleagues were the moral victors. </p> <p>\"The case taught me that if you are prepared to take a stand for the principle of free speech,\" he says, \"you can win a lot of support. That is the only reason why Spiked has been able to rise from the ashes.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.Spiked-online.com\">www.spiked-online.com</a></p>",

It seems positively foolhardy in the extreme when your last venture was bankrupted after a blazing libel trial. Last March, LM, the magazine formerly known as Living Marxism, closed after losing a libel action brought by ITN over an article in which the publication accused the broadcaster of misrepresenting one of the most harrowing images of the Bosnian war. The photo, published in papers around the world, including the Guardian, showed an emaciated Muslim, Fikret Alic, enclosed behind barbed wire at the Trnopolje camp in northern Bosnia. In fact, the wire had surrounded the ITN crew. Nevertheless, the jury accepted that the camp was - contrary to what LM suggested - a prison, and therefore the ITN pictures had not distorted the truth. The jury awarded \u00a3375,000 in damages to ITN and reporters Penny Marshall and Ian Williams. Mick Hume, LM editor, and Helene Guldberg, its publisher, were personally liable for the damages and the legal costs of \u00a3500,000. They have been living under the spectre of bankruptcy for the past three years. But some time this month - the date is deliberately vague - Hume and Guldberg are making a comeback online. Spiked-online.com will be LM and more. Hume and Guldberg have seized on the demise of LM as an opportunity to recreate in cyberspace what was a libertarian voice in print. Guldberg says LM supporters urged her and Hume to try to find a way of carrying on somehow. At the time, when internet mania was at its height, going online must have seemed the obvious answer. Now things are bleak, but nevertheless, Spiked, based in the new media enclave of Farringdon Road, will be going online 'for those who want to see some change in the real world as well as the virtual one'. Hume, 41, who is also a columnist for the Times, says the audience for Spiked will be the \"intelligent, maverick type\" and believes that there will be a market for the online magazine in Europe and the US. For Hume and his team of four journalists, Spiked will be a bigger and better LM, untrammelled by the distribution problems that can hamper a controversial magazine. Hume is particularly optimistic about winning eyeballs in the US, despite the online presence of established niche players such as Mother Jones, the Nation and Salon. LM made a name for itself by offering views not normally associated with the left. It pushed the line that society is too squeamish about scientific research and that concern over GM foods and biotechnology, for example, bordered on hysteria. LM also pooh-poohed the political preoccupation with child-rearing, crime and health. A piece on child safety by Guldberg, Spiked's managing editor, typifies the site's contrarian-libertarian take on the world. She rubbishes the obsession with child safety. Despite a Guardian/ICM poll released last August showing that 79% of parents believe the world is more dangerous for children, she argues that children in fact are healthier, wealthier, safer and better educated than ever. In obsessing about the need to keep children safe, 'we risk denying them the freedom they need to develop, to grow up. And this has its own, very real dangers', she writes. LM sank because it pushed the boat out too far on the Bosnian war, so will Spiked be more cautious? Hume says he always hesitates before running really contentious stuff anywhere and after three years with the LM case has \"no wish to waste another moment of my life with libel lawyers. But I hope that, if we believe that something is true and important, we will still publish it.\" Interestingly, Hume says the problem with the article about the Bosnian war photo was not that it was wrong per se, but in how it was presented: \"I am sure I could edit that same article today in such a way that even Mr Justice Morland could not object to it.\" For Hume and Goldberg, Spiked took their minds off the threat of bankruptcy that has dogged them ever since the start of the ITN libel case almost four years ago. They started to put it together at the beginning of last year, relying on the network that sustained LM. It took the relatively small amount of \u00a3100,000 to cobble together the venture, thanks to the brains and sweat of volunteers. Hume is cagey about the identity of investors, saying only that it came from people who made money early on in the internet boom. In the long term, Spiked will count on advertising, but also on sponsorship for seminars and conferences that also ran alongside LM. They will need a fair amount of money as they plan audio and video streaming for the site, functions that will not come cheap. But then LM's survival always seemed puzzling from a financial point of view, so Hume and Guldberg may be able to pull off the same trick online. None of their assets is in Spiked so the venture is out of reach of any bankruptcy proceedings. Now all they have to do is stay out of the libel courts. Although LM lost the ITN case, Hume clearly believes he and his colleagues were the moral victors. \"The case taught me that if you are prepared to take a stand for the principle of free speech,\" he says, \"you can win a lot of support. That is the only reason why Spiked has been able to rise from the ashes.\" www.spiked-online.com",

The newly created position of head of marketing has been created to control all aspects of the GLA's marketing, advertising and paid publicity. This will include publications, exhibitions and direct mail campaigns. The marketing chief will plan and implement marketing and events strategies for the GLA. He or she will explore new media initiatives such as using the GLA website for consultation and marketing. One of the key tasks facing the new recruit will be helping the communications team roll out a \"brand\" for London. Mr Livingstone wants London to have a catchy slogan to rival the Big Apple's \"I love New York\". Ad agency Euro RSCG Wnek Gosper won the GLA's \u00a310m advertising account last year. Identity specialist Appetite has developed a corporate identity for the GLA. The new brand will first be used by bodies such as Transport for London and the Metropolitan Police. It will gradually extend across all London's services. The head of marketing will report to GLA executive communications director Charlotte Rowe, who joined from the London Tourist Board in December. Euro RSCG Wnek Gosper's first poster and radio campaign for the GLA will ask Londoners to submit their views on the mayor's plans for the capital's transport system.",

A ruling in the appeal court in San Francisco today could effectively close down the service - although Napster said last night that they were optimistic of success. </p> <p>According to the web site, 10,000 users logged on to just one of Napster's more than 100 computer servers sharing nearly 2m free song files. Last July saw 7,300 users sharing 800,000 files. </p> <p>In San Francisco today, the court is due to deliver its ruling on a lower court's injunction against the Redwood City-based company. </p> <p>The case arises out of the decision by the recording industry to sue Napster for breach of copyright. The music industry argued that artists were being deprived of revenue by Napster because people are able to download the music without paying any royalties. </p> <p>In a packed court hearing last July, attended by many Napster fans, it was decided that Napster had infringed copyright regulations but the appeal court stayed the injunction which could have closed the service. Napster - started by teenage programmer Shawn Fanning - was allowed to remain online and fans celebrated by logging on in record numbers. </p> <p>Napster, which has made much of its youthful image and has presented itself as an online David against a music industry Goliath, remains bullish that they can win the latest legal round. \"We have confidence in our legal position,\" said a statement on their web site. </p> <p>Despite its image, Napster looks set to join the music industry. Last year media group Bertlesmann took a stake, saying it would start charging for downloads.</p> <p><strong>Related articles</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4126993,00.html\">30.01.2001: Napster to charge online song swappers</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4126716,00.html\">29.01.2001: Success of Napster impresses Davos delegates</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4020371,00.html\">21.05.2000: 'Mom, I blew up the music industry'</a><br></p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.napster.com/\">Napster</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.riaa.org/\">Recording industry association of America</a><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of fans of the music-sharing service, Napster, were logging on over the week-end in anticipation of a judgment which could go against the firm in court this morning. A ruling in the appeal court in San Francisco today could effectively close down the service - although Napster said last night that they were optimistic of success. According to the web site, 10,000 users logged on to just one of Napster's more than 100 computer servers sharing nearly 2m free song files. Last July saw 7,300 users sharing 800,000 files. In San Francisco today, the court is due to deliver its ruling on a lower court's injunction against the Redwood City-based company. The case arises out of the decision by the recording industry to sue Napster for breach of copyright. The music industry argued that artists were being deprived of revenue by Napster because people are able to download the music without paying any royalties. In a packed court hearing last July, attended by many Napster fans, it was decided that Napster had infringed copyright regulations but the appeal court stayed the injunction which could have closed the service. Napster - started by teenage programmer Shawn Fanning - was allowed to remain online and fans celebrated by logging on in record numbers. Napster, which has made much of its youthful image and has presented itself as an online David against a music industry Goliath, remains bullish that they can win the latest legal round. \"We have confidence in our legal position,\" said a statement on their web site. Despite its image, Napster looks set to join the music industry. Last year media group Bertlesmann took a stake, saying it would start charging for downloads.

      "body": "<p>Ashley Highfield shakes his head in despair that the BBC was beaten to Big Brother. The landmark marriage of broadcasting and the internet, he says, was exactly the kind of thing on which the corporation should have led the way. </p> <p>As the BBC's first director of new media, it is Highfield's job to make sure the corporation doesn't get caught out again. One of director- general Greg Dyke's key appointments, he has been brought in to deliver a wake-up call. And it is clear that in the four months since taking the job, he has not been idle. </p> <p>Within half an hour of our meeting, he has detailed a long list of changes - many of which will raise the hackles of the commercial sector and BBC critics. BBC Online is to be rebranded, a licence fee-funded mobile phone service is to be launched, its interactive service will be available on Sky Digital for the first time, and a number of existing services face the axe. The list goes on. </p> <p>Highfield is also at the sharp end of the debate on the creeping commercialisation at the BBC. He is the person who will oversee the launch of BBC.com, the international version of the corporation's online news service, which will, controversially, accept advertising. He is also exploring ways of adding commercial elements to some existing websites. </p> <p>Highfield is one of Dyke's growing band of appointments from outside the corridors of the BBC. He joined the corporation from cable company Telewest and, as the Guardian photographer sets up, Highfield hurriedly switches off Sky News on one of the bank of TV sets behind him, before confessing to being an avid viewer. </p> <p>His appointment means that, for the first time, new media is represented at the main, 18-strong board level. His remit brings together existing online licence fee-funded news and sport services, interactive services across all the digital platforms, including satellite, cable and mobile, and what he describes as \"imagineering\" - fresh ways of merging new and old media in projects like Big Brother. </p> <p>The overarching strategy is to change the mindset of the BBC. One of his first jobs has been to appoint a dozen heads of new media attached to all the main BBC departments, with the aim of their being there at the outset of programme commissioning. Better access, will, Highfield hopes, avoid the Walking with Dinosaurs scenario, which he holds up as an example of how not to run a new media strategy. \"Getting near the end of a four-year production and then, two months before finishing, asking the new media people to do a website is not how you do it,\" he says. </p> <p>This time around, the wire frames used in the production were passed straight to the new media creatives so that they could build 3D images that would allow website users to travel under the legs of the tyrannosaurus, or fly the pterodactyl, with the same realism shown on the broadcast. \"That is staggering. People can take those tools and create their own episode,\" says Highfield. </p> <p>He is passionate that new media is a vital tool for bringing people back to the BBC. He found it bizarre, he says, that the corporation's interactive text service was absent from Sky Digital. \"The marketing line will be to create the UK's number one digital destination and that implies we have to be ubiquitous - we have to be everywhere. I want consumers to know that they can switch on a TV, mobile phone or PC and know they are going to get a comprehensive range of quality-trusted BBC content.\" </p> <p>With hindsight, he says, the existing commercial-only deals to supply content over wireless internet may have been a mistake. \"I don't think you can look at mobile and say that it is somehow a uniquely different platform from narrowband internet or digital television. </p> <p>\"We've got to get out there into the platforms like satellite, like Sega Dreamcast consoles, like mobile phones, where people are light BBC consumers, to reach people for whom the BBC means less and less. That means having quite imaginative relationships with the evil empires of this world, like Sky. It also means doing a whole load of distribution deals on the net.\" </p> <p>This year's Wimbledon tennis on Sky Digital will have an interactive service, including the choice of six different courts plus news, match reports and results. Similar services will also be offered for the Open golf, and the text service on Sky Digital will be up later this year. </p> <p>The wider spread of services has also highlighted the \"mess\" of brands used by the corporation in new media - which Highfield plans to change by rebranding BBC Online, BBC Text and the cable services under a single, as yet undecided, name. </p> <p>\"Online is too parochial to the internet and it doesn't work on TV or on mobile, and the word 'text' is rather, well . . . Actually I don't like the name 'new media' as a division. It's pejorative. It implies there is old media. One of the things we'll be doing is creating a really simple, single brand for all our services.\" </p> <p>Funding of the growing number of services, though, is clearly an issue. Dyke's cuts in croissants and taxis, as well as back office job losses, are on the way to producing the kind of savings promised when the BBC won its licence fee increase, but the demands on cash, particularly with the launch of new digital TV channels, are only increasing. </p> <p>Highfield's budget last year was \u00a370m. An increase has been agreed for this year, but he declines to say how much. There are about 1,000 staff working for the division, representing about 5% of the BBC workforce. </p> <p>Many of the costs of new media leverage existing resources - the cameras are already at the courtside at Wimbledon, for example - but still the issue of generating commercial revenues, particularly online, refuses to go away. </p> <p>Highfield says the internal argument for an international online service carrying advertising has already been won. \"The government is quite clearly telling us we have to find ways of making money from our international traffic on the co.uk service. We are currently providing a service to people who don't pay the licence fee and therefore we have to explore ways of doing that.\" </p> <p>He is adamant, however, that the licence fee-funded news and sport services are sacred cows. \"We have no plans to accept advertising on public services. Apart from anything else, I would not want to jeopardise the sum we get from the licence fee. It would be mad. The budget we get from the licence fee would dwarf any commercial revenues we could hope to gain.\" </p> <p>The mobile phone service, he adds, falls into the broader debate in the BBC about the boundaries between publicly funded and commercial services. \"We haven't got any further than saying that we have to revisit the current status quo. But for the Radio 1 site, for instance, not to be able to send text messages - when that's almost exclusively how teens communicate with each other - is a major gap in our communications portfolio. We know we have to offer short message services as well as Wap.\" </p> <p>Existing websites are one area where he does see potential for adding commercial elements. The site for the Proms, for example, doesn't even sell tickets at the moment. \"The rules are probably too prescriptive, but I think it's also the case that no one has really looked at them in too much detail. We don't have the answers yet.\" </p> <p>He is also keen to develop further transparent links to commercial services from BBC-branded sites. Other sites may be under threat. If a website is not number one or two in its market, or if it doesn't serve the interests of a market ignored by the commercial sector, then it will be closed as part of a root-and-branch review of the services on offer. </p> <p>His plans for the online news and sports services include an overhaul of the sites' architecture to make them more easily relevant to individual users, and ramping up the interactive content. \"I want to introduce large amounts of chat, discussion rooms, forums, alerts, voting - you can take it so far forward. BBC Online has been brilliant at 'broadcasting at', but actually quite poor at 'engaging with' users.\" </p> <p>As for the next Big Brother, Highfield suggests there is some programming on the way that will make up for lost ground - although he is reluctant to be specific. He will know he has done his job when there is no longer the need for a director of new media. \"We will have been successful when new media is so a part of everyday life around the BBC that no one would dream of commissisoning A History of Britain, say, without an interactive element not just stuck on afterwards but integrated right up front when it was commissioned.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Today may be the last day to download music for free from embattled song-swap service Napster, as a US court prepares to rule on whether the site has violated copyright law by allowing users to download music without providing payment to artists and record companies.</p> <p>This weekend tens of thousands of Napster's 50m users flooded the company's servers for last minute downloads in advance of the ruling, expected at 6pm GMT today. </p> <p>The five largest record labels - Sony, Warner, BMG, EMI and Universal - sued as soon as Redwood City-based Napster took off, saying it could rob them of billions of dollars in profits. </p> <p>The issue before the US 9th Circuit court of appeals today is whether to uphold a US District court judge's injunction ordering Napster to shut down pending a trial on the music industry lawsuit.

      "bodyText": "Today may be the last day to download music for free from embattled song-swap service Napster, as a US court prepares to rule on whether the site has violated copyright law by allowing users to download music without providing payment to artists and record companies. This weekend tens of thousands of Napster's 50m users flooded the company's servers for last minute downloads in advance of the ruling, expected at 6pm GMT today. The five largest record labels - Sony, Warner, BMG, EMI and Universal - sued as soon as Redwood City-based Napster took off, saying it could rob them of billions of dollars in profits. The issue before the US 9th Circuit court of appeals today is whether to uphold a US District court judge's injunction ordering Napster to shut down pending a trial on the music industry lawsuit. The injunction was put on hold pending the 9th Circuit review. But the three-judge panel also could rule more broadly, describing how copyright law should apply to emerging technologies that make it ever more difficult to control and profit from the distribution of music, software, books, movies and other creative content. In May 1999, Napster founder Shawn Fanning released software that made it easy for personal computer users to locate and trade songs they had stored as computer files in the MP3 format, which crunches digital recordings down to manageable lengths without sacrificing quality. The concept of \"peer-to-peer\", song trading quickly proved too popular to contain. As Napster users grew by the millions, other file-sharing programs also popped up, such as Gnutella and Freenet. Record labels themselves are looking to use the same technology, only with paying subscribers and secure digital formats that prevent copying. Major record labels hope today's ruling will force millions of computer users to pay for music the online music swapping service has allowed them to get for free. If Napster wins however, the ruling could give new life to other business ventures that have been waiting for guidance on whether a \"personal use\" exception to copyright law allows or prohibits trading copyrighted material over the Internet. Since the appeal court judges began deliberating in October, Napster has made agreements with former business foes like Bertelsmann AG, the parent company of the BMG music unit. The German media giant has promised much-needed capital if Napster switches to a subscription-based service that pays artists' royalties. The other four major labels are holding out for Napster's demise.

But, oh how the audience laughed. </p> <p>Ten points for the boys over at Firebox for initiative. An order comes through the website for a few thousand pounds; the delivery address? A country manor in Essex. The boys duly call to check whether it's kosher, and what transpires is that Firebox has now signed up a country lord, the Honourable Mark J Petre, to write regular dispatches. Yes, aristocrats online, or \"cybercrats\" as Mark prefers, are the new, as yet untapped, demographic. Even, rumour has it, Tom Parker Bowles, reformed PR monster, is trying to get a dot.com for toffs off the ground. In Mark's latest column he talks of how he kitted out his north-wing corridor with optics and a dartboard - for the time when one has to give the driver the night off. It's all highly entertaining stuff. </p> <p>The cream of Westminster new media was out in force for an e-communications conference thrown by the government last week. The new e-envoy Andrew Pinder was paraded around for all the civil servant IT bods to clock, and the talk was about how the government was forging ahead with its online plans. Yes, we know - we've been told often enough. But most curious was the overemphasis on Chatham House rules (off the record, for us laypersons) when, oddly enough, there was absolutely nothing at all juicy to come out of the event. The sole interesting point came out in a phone call with a local government official, who revealed how unimpressed councils are with the initiatives. It appears that the moves to put all local authority services online by 2005 are way behind schedule. Needless to say, they are not very impressed with the hyperbole. </p> <p>And so it came to pass that T-Motion, Deutsche Telekom's all-singing, all-dancing Wap service was switched on for us lucky One 2 One subscribers last week. Intrigued by the countless text messages that One 2 One spammed me about it, I dialled up. Was it as \"fast, exciting and fun\" as it was billed? Well, it was quick, confusing and irritating. I got lost in the chat rooms, and got annoyed because after all the research about Wap, no operator has yet developed a generic \"back\" button to escape the mesh of links. Worst of all, for the first two days after launch, all I got was the message that news only worked on One 2 One Wap-enabled handsets. Wonder what they thought I was using? </p> <p> Amy Vickers is new media editor of mediatheguardian.com </p>",

      "bodyText": "BSkyB chief executive Tony Ball couldn't help putting the boot in to his terrestrial brethren at the company's first half results presentation last week. ITV's exile from Sky Digital shows no sign of ending. Ball explained that Sky Digital's much-hyped interactive service is described as iTV by industry specialists, adding: \"That's the only way you'll hear the letters ITV at this company over the next few years.\" Meow. But, oh how the audience laughed. Ten points for the boys over at Firebox for initiative. An order comes through the website for a few thousand pounds; the delivery address? A country manor in Essex. The boys duly call to check whether it's kosher, and what transpires is that Firebox has now signed up a country lord, the Honourable Mark J Petre, to write regular dispatches. Yes, aristocrats online, or \"cybercrats\" as Mark prefers, are the new, as yet untapped, demographic. Even, rumour has it, Tom Parker Bowles, reformed PR monster, is trying to get a dot.com for toffs off the ground. In Mark's latest column he talks of how he kitted out his north-wing corridor with optics and a dartboard - for the time when one has to give the driver the night off. It's all highly entertaining stuff. The cream of Westminster new media was out in force for an e-communications conference thrown by the government last week. The new e-envoy Andrew Pinder was paraded around for all the civil servant IT bods to clock, and the talk was about how the government was forging ahead with its online plans. Yes, we know - we've been told often enough. But most curious was the overemphasis on Chatham House rules (off the record, for us laypersons) when, oddly enough, there was absolutely nothing at all juicy to come out of the event. The sole interesting point came out in a phone call with a local government official, who revealed how unimpressed councils are with the initiatives. It appears that the moves to put all local authority services online by 2005 are way behind schedule. Needless to say, they are not very impressed with the hyperbole. And so it came to pass that T-Motion, Deutsche Telekom's all-singing, all-dancing Wap service was switched on for us lucky One 2 One subscribers last week. Intrigued by the countless text messages that One 2 One spammed me about it, I dialled up. Was it as \"fast, exciting and fun\" as it was billed? Well, it was quick, confusing and irritating. I got lost in the chat rooms, and got annoyed because after all the research about Wap, no operator has yet developed a generic \"back\" button to escape the mesh of links. Worst of all, for the first two days after launch, all I got was the message that news only worked on One 2 One Wap-enabled handsets. Wonder what they thought I was using?

      "byline": "Maggie Brown",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>By autumn the main five television channels will be offering viewers 15 and a half hours of home-grown soap opera a week, compared with 11 and a half now. Quite a jump. This growth stems from the BBC's planned fourth weekly episode of EastEnders, the impact of ITV's Trafalgar Road (casting now) and Crossroads (starting next month). It is driven by twin pressures: the intensifying competition for audiences, and a quest for value-for-money drama that can deliver huge numbers for a low budget. But it leaves big questions unanswered: can we take any more? Should diversity be sacrificed on the soap altar? </p> <p>Greg Dyke, who overthrew John Birt's blanket refusal to back a fourth EastEnders, raised the whole issue last week when he was lightly grilled on his first year in office by Loyd Grossman at the LSE. The answer to the first question, at least, is simple. If you are an EastEnders fan, a fourth episode probably can't come soon enough. Emmerdale, stripped nightly since Christmas, is garnering average audiences of 10.5m. </p> <p>In fact these figures for soap overload understate the impact, by excluding weekend omnibuses and daily repeats. Nor does the total include the rise of new dramas that may become fully fledged soaps shortly. These are the BBC's acclaimed daytime drama, Doctors and Channel 4's experimental pop- video-meets-teen-drama, E4's As If, which is being sized up as Channel 4's third soap alongside Brookside and Hollyoaks. It also ignores popular imports such as Neighbours, and ITV's The Bill, which has the year-round quality of a soap and is becoming increasingly soap-like by focusing more on characters' private lives. </p> <p>At BSkyB, director of broadcasting Mark Sharman plans an overhaul (yet again) of Sky One. He may throw resources into Dream Team, the football drama series (which plunders Sky's real football footage), converting it to a full-blown soap. Two new soaps are also under consideration, a reversal of last year's decision to back costly drama specials. For Sharman, a soap costing \u00a365,000 an episode (compared with \u00a3600,000 and upwards for an hour of filmed drama with stars), which can be endlessly repeated, supplies exactly what he knows fickle satellite viewers want: consistency and familiarity. </p> <p>Quizzed on the issue, Dyke said ITV's four soaps were a sign, perhaps, that it is beginning to feel the strain of an advertising slow-down, and is opting for cheaper soaps at the expense of its prestige drama. (In fairness, Crossroads is replacing the imported Home &amp; Away, snatched by Channel 5, with UK programming). He thinks a fifth episode of Coronation Street is inevitable. </p> <p>Should the BBC be going down the same road? Some executives even say its duty is to devise a fresh second soap, rather than more EastEnders, but as Dyke observes pragmatically that is a hard thing to do - Eldorado haunts the BBC. Channel 5's daily soap Family Affairs is still struggling to make a mark. Mal Young, BBC's controller of continuing drama series, says: \"Popular is not a dirty word\". EastEnders will go through a careful expansion, he promises. \"It has a 10m base audience. They're addicts. If it's good, audiences will watch more; if it's crap, they stop. In the last six months EastEnders' quality has been up there with the greats. We've got to keep that standard of writing. I think EastEnders can be as good as Play for Today.\" </p> <p>Do soaps appeal ever more strongly? Kay Patrick, the experienced producer of Crossroads (\"All the sets are all pretty solid\"), says they are becoming dominant because \"people love being told stories. In the old days it was sagas, story telling around the fire. Soaps heighten stories in the way the old sagas do. Dickens understood it too. Passion, fear, hate, envy - it's all there.\" </p> <p>She adds quickly, though, that it's not going to be all gloom and doom at her four star hotel, now set on the edge of a market town. \"Soap is life in primary colours.

      "bodyText": "By autumn the main five television channels will be offering viewers 15 and a half hours of home-grown soap opera a week, compared with 11 and a half now. Quite a jump. This growth stems from the BBC's planned fourth weekly episode of EastEnders, the impact of ITV's Trafalgar Road (casting now) and Crossroads (starting next month). It is driven by twin pressures: the intensifying competition for audiences, and a quest for value-for-money drama that can deliver huge numbers for a low budget. But it leaves big questions unanswered: can we take any more? Should diversity be sacrificed on the soap altar? Greg Dyke, who overthrew John Birt's blanket refusal to back a fourth EastEnders, raised the whole issue last week when he was lightly grilled on his first year in office by Loyd Grossman at the LSE. The answer to the first question, at least, is simple. If you are an EastEnders fan, a fourth episode probably can't come soon enough. Emmerdale, stripped nightly since Christmas, is garnering average audiences of 10.5m. In fact these figures for soap overload understate the impact, by excluding weekend omnibuses and daily repeats. Nor does the total include the rise of new dramas that may become fully fledged soaps shortly. These are the BBC's acclaimed daytime drama, Doctors and Channel 4's experimental pop- video-meets-teen-drama, E4's As If, which is being sized up as Channel 4's third soap alongside Brookside and Hollyoaks. It also ignores popular imports such as Neighbours, and ITV's The Bill, which has the year-round quality of a soap and is becoming increasingly soap-like by focusing more on characters' private lives. At BSkyB, director of broadcasting Mark Sharman plans an overhaul (yet again) of Sky One. He may throw resources into Dream Team, the football drama series (which plunders Sky's real football footage), converting it to a full-blown soap. Two new soaps are also under consideration, a reversal of last year's decision to back costly drama specials. For Sharman, a soap costing \u00a365,000 an episode (compared with \u00a3600,000 and upwards for an hour of filmed drama with stars), which can be endlessly repeated, supplies exactly what he knows fickle satellite viewers want: consistency and familiarity. Quizzed on the issue, Dyke said ITV's four soaps were a sign, perhaps, that it is beginning to feel the strain of an advertising slow-down, and is opting for cheaper soaps at the expense of its prestige drama. (In fairness, Crossroads is replacing the imported Home &amp; Away, snatched by Channel 5, with UK programming). He thinks a fifth episode of Coronation Street is inevitable. Should the BBC be going down the same road? Some executives even say its duty is to devise a fresh second soap, rather than more EastEnders, but as Dyke observes pragmatically that is a hard thing to do - Eldorado haunts the BBC. Channel 5's daily soap Family Affairs is still struggling to make a mark. Mal Young, BBC's controller of continuing drama series, says: \"Popular is not a dirty word\". EastEnders will go through a careful expansion, he promises. \"It has a 10m base audience. They're addicts. If it's good, audiences will watch more; if it's crap, they stop. In the last six months EastEnders' quality has been up there with the greats. We've got to keep that standard of writing. I think EastEnders can be as good as Play for Today.\" Do soaps appeal ever more strongly? Kay Patrick, the experienced producer of Crossroads (\"All the sets are all pretty solid\"), says they are becoming dominant because \"people love being told stories. In the old days it was sagas, story telling around the fire. Soaps heighten stories in the way the old sagas do. Dickens understood it too. Passion, fear, hate, envy - it's all there.\" She adds quickly, though, that it's not going to be all gloom and doom at her four star hotel, now set on the edge of a market town. \"Soap is life in primary colours. Escapism, so people can live vicariously. There will be humour, we'll be showing the games people play.\" Her Crossroads has a gym, jacuzzi, and little sense of being in the Midlands. Richard Handford, the executive producer of The Bill, points out that the soap rise is also accompanied by longer runs of popular drama. ITV screens nearly 100 hours a year of The Bill annually, while 40 episodes of Casualty and Holby City have been ordered by BBC1, and 38 of Peak Practice by ITV. \"I think people are more conservative in their tastes, and less prepared to welcome the new.

      "body": "<p>One of the most grotesque and least well known achievements of the British in India was the great salt hedge. Roy Moxham's book, The Great Hedge of India, is testimony to a personal obsession to track this great monument to British imperial exploitation: 2,300 miles of thorny cacti, 10ft high, 14ft wide and guarded by 14,000 troops.</p> <p>Its purpose was to prevent salt smuggling into British-controlled India, where the British collected an exorbitant salt tax - it was the equivalent of two months' salary of an Indian peasant. The burden of this colonial crime is self-evident: the first health tip for anyone who gets sick in a hot country is to keep up the salt level. But not once under the British Raj was this salt tax relaxed, not even during famines. Salt became the symbol of imperial exploitation for Mahatma Gandhi's independence movement and the civil disobedience campaigns begun with the salt march of 1930.</p> <p>We complacently assume that such colonial atrocities are a thing of the past, and that in a much more enlightened 21st century, we wouldn't tolerate such a blatant disregard to human well being. But the unpalatable truth is that all that has changed is the form - colonialism has disappeared to be replaced by an alliance of corporate self-interest and governments eager to promote global capitalism. The salt hedge offers a neat analogy for Trips (the trade related intellectual property agreement) under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation - the purpose of which is every bit as exploitative and exclusive, and its consequences will be every bit as pernicious.</p> <p>Of all the acronyms that multilateralism seems to spew out (WTO, Gats and so on), the fiercest battles will be over Trips. Intellectual property has not been much of a rallying cry at the barricades before, but it will be. Why? The most dramatic reason is Aids, which is exposing the whole international patent system on drugs as solely in the interests of the handful of multinational drug companies which make huge profits from their 20-year patents. Copies - generic drugs - are being made at a fraction of the cost, but millions will die because the multinationals invoke Trips to protect their patents, as an Oxfam campaign launched today will make clear.</p> <p>Put baldly, patents are killing people. But that's not all. Intellectual property protection has become a tool to make permanent the growing inequality of the global economy: the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Drugs are only the most blatant example of how, through Trips, the developed countries have stacked the odds in their favour. They have set the ground rules for the knowledge economy so they can extract a constant flow of income from less developed countries. Those countries will never be able to close the technology gap. This is the same principle as the salt hedge - ensure a steady flow of revenue and eliminate competition. It is also, to use another metaphor, kicking away the ladder which you have just climbed up - and it has never happened before in the history of industrial development.</p> <p>What the rich countries chose to overlook is that their own economic development involved blatant abuse of patent law. The growth of the US textiles industry in the early 19th century was all based on ripping off the inventions being pioneered in the Lancashire mill towns. The Japanese did much the same later in the century with their textile industry, and in the early 20th century, they copied from the US and German steel industries. Post-war, Japan's economic miracle was based on innovative copying - with scant regard for patents.</p> <p>Most developed countries have had domestic patent regimes to reward invention, but have always ripped off each other's ideas. There were attempts to achieve some kind of international patent protection, but they had no power of enforcement until the WTO negotiated Trips. If a country breaches Trips, it faces the threat of trade sanctions. Suddenly the whole game changes dramatically. Trade sanctions by a major trading partner on a vulnerable economy is so serious that in most cases it guarantees compliance.</p> <p>The impetus for an international system of intellectual property protection was the rise of the knowledge economy. Countries such as the US wanted to maximise their returns on knowledge through licences on their patents across the globe. Seventy per cent of US export earnings are now linked to intellectual property - on everything from Aids drugs to brands such as Disney, McDonald's and Microsoft. The US needed an international regulatory regime to reap the benefits of its economic and cultural hegemony, and it is working: between 1991 and 1997, the value of royalties to the US doubled to more than $33bn a year. Naomi Klein addresses this in her book No Logo, as she charts the shift of production of trainers and jeans to Asian free trade zones where it represents a tiny cost compared to the value generated by the knowledge element - the brand management, advertising and design.</p> <p>Real money in the global economy is no longer made from the production of commodities (for example, the price of coffee has plunged) nor even from labour-intensive manufacturing; it is made from knowledge-intensive technology and services. Since 1980, the share of global trade represented by commodities has halved to 13% while that of hi-tech goods has doubled. It becomes harder and harder for developing countries to catch up. They can't copy - they have to import the technology and pay royalties on the licences. The flow of revenue is one way, from poor to rich.</p> <p>The stakes are so high in the knowledge economy that it is triggering a frenzied rush for patents. Applications for patents in the US have gone up from an annual 150,000 a year in the late 80s to 275,000 today. One of the most shocking examples is gene patenting. In October last year, there were patent applications on 126,672 human gene sequences. By this month that figure had gone up a staggering 38% to 175,624. Patents are now being used not just to protect an invention but as a strategy to scare off the competition by staking out an area of research. Of course, this rush to privatise knowledge only tilts the playing field more firmly against the developing world. In 1997, 26,000 patent applications were filed to the African intellectual property organisation. Only 31 came from resident Africans.</p> <p>The analogy of the salt hedge would not be lost in India where the implementation of Trips into domestic legislation is proving bitterly controversial. One of post-colonial India's great achievements, argues the activist Vandana Shiva, was to frame a patent law in 1970, which recognised that there were issues of human welfare and development that must take precedence over profit, particularly in the areas of food and health.</p> <p>This boosted a huge generic drugs industry which provides drugs which are much cheaper than over the border in Pakistan, and which have been exported all over the developing world. All that is now jeopardised.</p> <p>One of the shabbiest sections of the government's white paper published at the end of last year (Eliminating world poverty: making globalisation work for the poor) was that on intellectual property; it praised Trips, but acknowledged the difficulties for many developing countries. It proposed the time-honoured British solution of setting up a commission to look into the issue. Two months on, no commission has yet been appointed; a senior official from the Department of International Development, after endorsing Trips, admits that neither at home or internationally has much thought been given to \"what kind of intellectual property regime best serves poorer countries\".

ITN, ITV and Mori have reviewed how we will conduct our exit poll for ITV's election night programme, what margins of error we will build in, how we will ensure that the forecast is an accurate reflection of the poll data. </p> <p>We will certainly not be setting up a joint polling operation with other broadcasters as the US networks did - the US report makes clear this was a cost-cutting measure too far. </p> <p>Under the British system, of course, there is no danger of the polls misleading voters. The US networks called Florida twice. First they said Gore had won, then they called it for Bush while the result was still too close to call and many polling stations around the country were still open.

British television news organisations operate a convention that we do not report any polls or any campaigning while voting is taking place. </p> <p>The one US experience we would have liked to reproduce in the forthcoming UK election was the leaders' debates. They once again provided a mass television audience with one of the few focal points of the campaign and attracted viewers who were not watching very much other election coverage. </p> <p>Ironically, I suspect the experience of the US debates did not encourage the prime minister's advisers. I remember a senior Labour strategist after the last election saying he was opposed to Tony Blair ever debating with William Hague because although he was sure that Blair would win, Hague as the underdog could only come out of the debate with his reputation enhanced.

And like the first swallows ahead of spring there are the first slightly random shots from the spin doctors across the broadcasters' bows. </p> <p>Nothing so far can match the glorious ridiculousness of a solemn letter I received from a very experienced Labour spin doctor ahead of the last election. His complaint was that in a report we had allowed our cameras to dwell for too long on the Conservative poster of Tony Blair with \"demon eyes\". I checked how we had covered the last Labour poster which the Conservatives hadn't liked - and found that we had given it the same number of seconds of coverage as the Blair poster.

The Today programme will, as before, have a special election unit. It will also have a \"battle bus\" for its presenters to go on the road.

At Tory central office, there is also concern about news priorities. \"We feel they may be under-doing it on the main channels,\" says one source. \"There'll be nothing in the evening until 10pm, and then the two big ones go head to head. That will definitely diminish coverage.\" </p> <p>By their nature, newspapers can be more flexible. Plans are still being worked out, but the general assessment is that the amount of space devoted to the election overall could be reduced by a quarter.

And despite the government's best efforts, Europe will be a significant issue.\" Newspapers will, as ever, set the agenda for broadcasters to follow. And it was the Sun's famous first day endorsement of Labour that set the tone for the whole campaign in '97. Trevor Kavanagh, its highly-influential political editor, has already hinted the paper is likely to back Tony Blair again. That will have ramifications for policy way beyond May 3. \"This is not just about the campaign, but about the second term for Labour,\" he says. \"Once they're over the election hurdle, all sorts of restraints will come off. Our readers will want to know about what they stand for, and the Europe issue will add enormous amounts of spice.\" </p> <p>With space and time so tight this time, the battle will be less about how stories are covered than about which stories are covered. So far, according to one BBC News executive, the pressure from the political parties is \"not unmanageable\". It's early days, though. And should the BBC, as part of its public interest obligations, be seen to be encouraging interest in the elections, rather than reflecting it? That question is deeply political. Damazer insists that, while the BBC should not be a social engineer, it \"shouldn't be shy of providing programming that enables people to take a positive view about their role in society\". </p> <p>Certainly steps are being taken to pep up the way the coverage looks as well as sounds. Two weeks ago, a now-notorious press office operation was aimed at showing that more women were being deployed for the election. This led to a spate of \"BBC babes\" stories, which annoyed not just male journalists who felt they were being sidelined but female ones who felt they were being patronised. \"I would have felt more worried if there had been any substance to the story,\" says one (male) correspondent. \"I thought we had moved on from this kind of portrayal,\" says one (female) correspondent. </p> <p>What actually happened was that the BBC's Millbank operation, where the politics is based, won an internal victory by insisting that its correspondents, and not \"big hitters\" from other departments, should be the main reporters with the party leaders. Those chosen were all women - Carolyn Quinn (Labour), Laura Trevelyan (Tories) and June Kelly (LibDems). The trouble, though, with being on the leaders' buses is that the main pieces each evening tend to be pulled together by the senior correspondents back in London - who, it so happens, will all be men: Andrew Marr, Mark Mardell and John Pienaar.

      "byline": "Duncan Campbell",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>So farewell then, The Realist. The publication described as the father and mother of underground journalism in America has published its final edition. After more than 40 years of scandalous and eccentric muckraking, the last copies are finally on the shelves of the nation's newsagents and bookshops - or at least those of them who don't mind the risk of a libel action or an injunction. </p> <p>Paul Krassner, the founder and editor of the publication which has affronted everyone from the Kennedy clan to the fans of Peanuts, has called it a day. And although he first announced his intention to close the paper more than a year ago, he insists that there will be no more. </p> <p>\"I'm certain that this is the last one,\" says Krassner from his new home in Desert Hot Springs near Palm Springs. \"It's served its purpose. I know I'll get tempted but I don't want to be like Frank Sinatra.\" </p> <p>Anyone less like Frank Sinatra is hard to imagine although, like Sinatra, Krassner has a talent for music and enjoys risk-taking. Krassner is 68 now, one of the founders of the Yippies (the Youth International Party a sort of loose anarchic grouping of dissidents), the person who edited Lenny Bruce's autobiography and a man who has taken LSD with Groucho Marx and Timothy Leary. As a six-year-old child prodigy violinist in New York, he was the youngest person ever to perform at the Carnegie Hall. During one concert as a child he tripped as he went on stage and the Musical Courier reported that he had \"skipped engagingly.\" It was that review that he claims first alerted him to the world of media distortion and seems to have acted as his guiding light ever since. </p> <p>Having cut his teeth as a writer for Mad magazine, Krassner was anxious to go into areas of writing that even that anarchic publication felt were out of bounds. The result was The Realist, founded in 1958, which, during the height of its notoriety, was the essential publication for followers of everything from the Kennedy assassination conspiracy to the Lewinsky affair. </p> <p>It was responsible in 1967 for a bizarre urban myth which is still repeated as fact in parts of America to this day: that Lyndon Johnson had committed an unnatural act on the exit wound of the slain Kennedy as the body was being flown back from Dallas. Krassner managed to continue to offend till the end; the penultimate issue of The Realist, which came just after the death of Peanuts creator Charles Schulz last year, showed the loveable Peanuts characters in various acts of coitus. This was too much even for some of Krassner's supporters. </p> <p>Sometimes the magazine would \"rest\" for a few months at its home in San Francisco and then suddenly reappear. It faced libel actions and police searches, but always just man aged to survive. In the meantime, hundreds of similar publications sprouted, most only briefly, throughout the world under the umbrella term of the \"underground press\". </p> <p>In Britain, the first and one of the last of such publications was IT or International Times, founded by expatriate American Jim Haynes in the 1960s and laid to rest finally in 1974. Its last editor Roger Hutchinson, now the newly arrived editor of the Stornoway Gazette, said this week of The Realist: \"It was easily the earliest and it is astonishing that it survived so long. What was the underground press? It's a very metaphysical question - it was really just alternative publishing although that's not quite such a colourful term.\" For Hutchinson, the main reason for the demise of the British underground press - IT, Oz, Frendz - back in the 1970s was simple economics; the adverts from the music business dried up, the mainstream music press hired the IT and Oz journalists and distribution was always a problem.

      "bodyText": "So farewell then, The Realist. The publication described as the father and mother of underground journalism in America has published its final edition. After more than 40 years of scandalous and eccentric muckraking, the last copies are finally on the shelves of the nation's newsagents and bookshops - or at least those of them who don't mind the risk of a libel action or an injunction. Paul Krassner, the founder and editor of the publication which has affronted everyone from the Kennedy clan to the fans of Peanuts, has called it a day. And although he first announced his intention to close the paper more than a year ago, he insists that there will be no more. \"I'm certain that this is the last one,\" says Krassner from his new home in Desert Hot Springs near Palm Springs. \"It's served its purpose. I know I'll get tempted but I don't want to be like Frank Sinatra.\" Anyone less like Frank Sinatra is hard to imagine although, like Sinatra, Krassner has a talent for music and enjoys risk-taking. Krassner is 68 now, one of the founders of the Yippies (the Youth International Party a sort of loose anarchic grouping of dissidents), the person who edited Lenny Bruce's autobiography and a man who has taken LSD with Groucho Marx and Timothy Leary. As a six-year-old child prodigy violinist in New York, he was the youngest person ever to perform at the Carnegie Hall. During one concert as a child he tripped as he went on stage and the Musical Courier reported that he had \"skipped engagingly.\" It was that review that he claims first alerted him to the world of media distortion and seems to have acted as his guiding light ever since. Having cut his teeth as a writer for Mad magazine, Krassner was anxious to go into areas of writing that even that anarchic publication felt were out of bounds. The result was The Realist, founded in 1958, which, during the height of its notoriety, was the essential publication for followers of everything from the Kennedy assassination conspiracy to the Lewinsky affair. It was responsible in 1967 for a bizarre urban myth which is still repeated as fact in parts of America to this day: that Lyndon Johnson had committed an unnatural act on the exit wound of the slain Kennedy as the body was being flown back from Dallas. Krassner managed to continue to offend till the end; the penultimate issue of The Realist, which came just after the death of Peanuts creator Charles Schulz last year, showed the loveable Peanuts characters in various acts of coitus. This was too much even for some of Krassner's supporters. Sometimes the magazine would \"rest\" for a few months at its home in San Francisco and then suddenly reappear. It faced libel actions and police searches, but always just man aged to survive. In the meantime, hundreds of similar publications sprouted, most only briefly, throughout the world under the umbrella term of the \"underground press\". In Britain, the first and one of the last of such publications was IT or International Times, founded by expatriate American Jim Haynes in the 1960s and laid to rest finally in 1974. Its last editor Roger Hutchinson, now the newly arrived editor of the Stornoway Gazette, said this week of The Realist: \"It was easily the earliest and it is astonishing that it survived so long. What was the underground press? It's a very metaphysical question - it was really just alternative publishing although that's not quite such a colourful term.\" For Hutchinson, the main reason for the demise of the British underground press - IT, Oz, Frendz - back in the 1970s was simple economics; the adverts from the music business dried up, the mainstream music press hired the IT and Oz journalists and distribution was always a problem. In addition, the underground press became less relevant to people with the arrival of the women's movement and the gay rights movement. Life moved on. In the US, publications such as Village Voice flourished - although they have long since crossed the line into the mainstream. It is this format of part-guide, part-alternative news - pioneered in the UK by Time Out - that became the main method of survival for such publications. To this day, throughout the US, it is such papers as the Bay Guardian in San Francisco and the LA Weekly in Los Angeles that provide the standard non-mainstream local news for cities.

It goes to the heart of how the modern world is to be run and whether the institutions set up to police the global economy are up to the job. </p> <p>Eleven million people in poor countries will die from infectious diseases this year. Put a different way, it means that by the time you finish reading this column 100 people will have died. Half of them will be children aged under five. Just over a quarter - 2.6m - will die from HIV/Aids. </p> <p>It is easy to work out why the death toll is so high. Poverty breeds ill-health and encourages the spread of infection, and the world is awash with poor countries. Just as a starving man knows there is food at the Ritz, governments in Africa, Asia and Latin America know there are medicines to treat these illnesses if only they could afford them. </p> <p>But the bigger developing countries have found a way round this problem by making cheap copies of western drugs. India, for example, makes 70% of its own drugs, while Egypt, Thailand, Argentina and Brazil have also taken steps to become more self-reliant in pharmaceuticals. Poorer developing countries also benefit because they can import cheap generic drugs even if they cannot manufacture them. </p> <p>This should mean our story has a happy ending. It means more people get treated because the health budgets of poor countries go further. It means that developing countries have a chance to move into industries that have a higher technological component. And it means increased competition, putting downward pressure on prices. This final point - that the freer markets are the better - is usually the clincher when it comes to the economics of globalisation. But not this time. </p> <p>Enter the two other characters in our story - the world's largest pharmaceutical companies and the World Trade Organisation. Four companies dominate the pharmaceutical industry - Merck, Pfizer, Glaxo SmithKline, and Eli Lilly, and they wield enormous financial clout. </p> <p>The Big Four operate like a cartel, and like all cartels seek to wield monopoly power. It is basic economics that monopolies lead to higher prices, which is why many governments use anti-trust legislation to break them up. To say that the Big Four do not like the idea of cheap drugs coming onto the market from developing countries is something of an understatement. More competition equals lower share price. </p> <p>But the financial muscle of the pharmaceutical companies also gives them enormous political leverage. So, during the Uruguay round of trade talks they lobbied hard for tougher rules protecting intellectual property, which provided patent protection for a minimum of 20 years for \"new and inventive\" products. </p> <p>Where previously around 50 developing countries and several developed countries had excluded medicines from being patented, the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (Trips) deal made both pharmaceuticals and biotechnology part of the global regime. Infringements of the Trips agreement are heard by a WTO disputes panel, and unlike in a criminal trial, the burden of proof put on the defendant country. </p> <p>In itself, the Trips - a protectionist clause in what was supposed a free trade agreement roused suspicions about the way in which the rules were being skewed to suit powerful interest groups in rich countries. However, some safeguards were included. Countries could cite a national emergency as a reason to infringe the Trips agreement. </p> <p>Effectively, this provided two loopholes. Countries could either manufacture cheap drugs themselves using what are known as compulsory licences to override patents, which is what Brazil is trying to do, or they could import a patented drug from wherever it was sold cheapest, the method favoured by South Africa. </p> <p>All quite simple, you might think. If the HIV/Aids pandemic does not constitute an emergency it is hard to know what would. The developing countries win, the drugs companies admit defeat, more people live happily ever after. If only. What is happening now is that the US is using every available means to close the WTO loopholes. </p> <p>In part this has involved armies of lawyers crawling all over the 73 articles making up the Trips agreement, in part it has involved legal action. But it also involved 21st century gunboat diplomacy. For example, the US offers a special deal to the Dominican Republic for exports of textiles. It is now threatening to withdraw this privilege unless the country scraps plans for compulsory licensing and parallel importing. Brazil and India have been warned that they could face sanctions under America's bilateral Super 301 legislation. </p> <p>The dirty work for the drugs' companies is being done by the US government, although there is little doubt who is really behind it all. But gunboat diplomacy is still a dangerous game, because there is a risk that public opinion will turn against Merck and Glaxo SmithKline in the way that they have turned against Phillip Morris and the other tobacco companies. Becoming an international pariah is not good for the share price either. </p> <p>The Big Four have a defence. They say patent protection is vital if companies are to plough vast sums into developing new cures for the diseases affecting poor people. In addition, they argue that the incomes of the world's poor are so low that they would not be able to afford even generic copies of patented drugs, and that the answer is some form of public-private partnership. Several of the big companies back global initiatives either by donating drugs or by subsidising drugs provision. </p> <p>But the arguments of the pharmaceutical industry do not really stack up. For a start, their profit margins were already fat even before the Trips deal came into force. Secondly, R&amp;D costs are dwarfed by money spent on marketing drugs. Thirdly, only 10% of R&amp;D goes on drugs that account for 90% of global disease, with the bulk spent on first-world afflictions such as obesity. Finally, the drugs made available at lower prices are limited in supply and are still more expensive than generic substitutes. </p> <p>As Brazil has shown it is possible for a relatively poor country to treat HIV/Aids if they can manufacture the necessary drugs themselves. The price of triple therapy treatment is $4,000 in Rio, compared to $15,000 in New York. Almost 90,000 Brazilians who are HIV positive receive free treatment, four times as many as would receive the care if the country were paying full patent price. </p> <p>The US has started proceedings at the WTO seeking to force Brazil to amend its patent law. Brazil, to its great credit, is standing up to the US bully boys in what is clearly a test case for multilateralism. Ever since the riots in Seattle, the WTO and the other global institutions have been under relentless scrutiny and attack, the main charge being that they put profit before people. If the WTO backs the drugs companies, it will be case proved. What should happen is that the WTO should clarify its rules to give developing countries the right to produce or import medicines at affordable prices. If a country says that it is infringing a patent to cope with a national emergency, the burden of proof should be on the patent holder to prove that the country is wrong. </p> <p>The WTO is not a law unto itself. Governments should write the rules, not multinational corporations. And if they fail to back Brazil, India and Egypt they will have blood on their hands. It was once said that all that is needed for evil needs to triumph is for good men to do nothing. And what is happening here is evil. I have tried to think of another word for it. But there isn't one.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Refilwe is a spectral figure, so thin that the light from the huge hospital window at her back seems to pass through her. She sits as straight as a knife, all bone, white robe, and huge eyes gazing at nothing, breathing shallowly through an open mouth. She is 30 and has a son of seven. She has tuberculosis and her mouth is covered with the telltale white spots of a common infection she cannot fight off, because HIV is destroying her body's resistance. </p> <p>Ask her how she is and she slowly turns her entire body towards you. \"I'm feeling better,\" she whispers. It is a fiction maintained by the plump and jolly nurses at the Natalspruit hospital outside Johannesburg who have dozens more like her on drips in wards 13 and 16, where anybody with any strength resists going because if you have HIV, you have no future. </p> <p>Refilwe, impossibly, gets to her feet and makes her way with pitiful steps and the arm of a nurse to the door, a walking wraith. She is going to the TB clinic. They will sort out the TB but then they will send her home to die. She is fatally weakened and there are no antiretroviral drugs to take on HIV here. </p> <p>Nokuthula, 23, is also under a death sentence, for all that she appears robust with health. So is her 18-month-old son Sipho, whose name means a gift. The young mother has put herself and her child in the care of the traditional healer in the township outside Natalspruit hospital who gives them herb and bark infusions to make them strong. But traditional medicine could not save Nokuthula's husband, who died of Aids last September. </p> <p>At an age when women in the west are embarking on families and careers, Refilwe and Nokuthula have begun the business of dying. They live in the East Rand suburbs of Johannesburg, South Africa, where one in five is estimated to be harbouring the virus that will kill them. </p> <p>Across Africa and the developing world millions more will die of diseases that are treatable in the west, such as diarrhoea, meningitis, malaria, TB and Aids. The hospitals do what they can, but their best efforts are a sticking plaster on a haemorrhage. The western drugs they need are unaffordable. Life is priced too high. </p> <p>Thirty-five miles away in Pretoria, a legal battle critical to the fate of many more women like Refilwe and Nokuthula, their men and their children, is about to begin. Case number 4183/98 in the South African high court is an action brought by 42 pharmaceutical companies, including the British giant GlaxoSmithKline, against the South African government. </p> <p>The case is an attempt to block South Africa from importing cheap medicines. The drug companies have spent three years and millions of pounds preparing the case. </p> <p>They have retained virtually every patent lawyer in South Africa. On March 5 their barristers will try to stop the South African government from buying the medicines its people so badly need from countries where the prices are lowest, on the grounds that it is infringing world trade agreements. </p> <p>The rest of Africa will be closely watching the outcome of the trial. So will developing countries on other continents. With the death toll from infectious diseases inexorably rising, especially in Africa, a tide of outrage is swelling among local activists and international aid organisations who see medicines denied to the sick in the name of commerce. </p> <p>More than 2.5m people die every year from Aids-related illnesses. More than 13m children have lost one or both parents to the condition. There are more than 32m men, women and children infected by HIV in developing countries. AZT and 3TC, the basic antiretroviral drugs in the west, would keep them alive and well, but the price tag is $10,000 (\u00a37,000) to $15,000 per patient a year. The majority of employed people in South Africa, with whole families to support, earn less than $3,000 a year, and by comparison with most of the rest of the continent, they are rich. </p> <p>But there are now alternatives - cheap copies of life-saving medicines called generics, made mainly in Brazil, India and Thailand whose national laws allow them to ignore drug patents in cases of dire human need. Thailand believes it could reduce the cost to $200 a year per patient. It is a price the South African government might be able to pay for the life of Refilwe and Nokuthula, but the drug companies, in Case 4183/98, afraid of the potential worldwide consequences if their prices start to be undercut, say no. </p> <p>Today in Cape Town at least 5,000 supporters of the successful grassroots Treatment Action Campaign will march on parliament to demand the medicines. At the same time in London, Oxfam is launching an international campaign demanding help for developing countries who want to use legitimate measures to buy or make their own cheap drugs, but who are bullied into submission by the lawyers working for drug companies and by the western governments who support them. </p> <p>The pharmaceutical companies argue that they need 20 years of patent protection to recoup the vast sum it costs to research and develop drugs. They say it takes $1bn and at least 12 years to get a new medicine to market. </p> <p>But, their accusers say, 90% of those new medicines are designed for 10% of the world's population in rich countries who can pay for them. The companies argue they already sell to developing countries at prices lower than in the west and that, with the approval of UNAids, the joint UN programme on HIV/Aids, five major companies have offered 85% discounts on drugs that are badly needed. </p> <p>That could bring antiretrovirals down to $1,500 a patient, low enough for poor countries to hand them out to a chosen few but, say critics, millions would still have to die. </p> <p>The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association of South Africa, which is bringing the case with the international companies, says it supports any country's right to buy supplies of drugs that are cheaper abroad \"in exceptional circumstances\". But it argues that section 15c of the Medicines Act, passed by the South African government in 1997 to allow it to import cheap copies of western medicines, would give the health minister \"unfettered discretion to override patent rights for medicines in this country\". And it was appalled when the South African delegation told a World Health Organisation meeting in January 1999 that the new legislation was a model which the rest of Africa should follow. </p> <p>It is not just Africa that worries the big pharmaceuticals. On behalf of the industry the US government is taking the offensive to Brazil, which has had dramatic success in manufacturing its own cheap copies of patented drugs and now exports generics. Its price for an AZT equivalent is down from $15,000 a year to $4,000. There are now 60,000 people with HIV in Brazil who get free treatment. </p> <p>At the heart of the growing legal battles directed against South Africa, Brazil and several other developing countries lies a little known international agreement called Trips - trade related intellectual property rights. It was agreed within the World Trade Organisation in order to ensure patent rights were respected around the world. The poorest countries have until 2006 to comply with Trips by passing their own patent laws. Under Trips, signatory states can pass clauses, as South Africa has tried to do, to bypass patents and make or buy cheaper drugs in cases of \"dire emergency\", and few could argue Aids is less than that. </p> <p>But the west's sharp legal minds, backed by vast drug company wealth, are willing and able to mount expensive challenges in the courts to uphold their patent rights - and thus the price of their drugs - as is about to happen in Pretoria. </p> <p>For the first time, there is also about to be a challenge in the WTO itself. Last month the new US administration, which accepted substantial election funding from the pharmaceutical industry, asked for a WTO disputes hearing where it will claim Brazil is in breach of Trips. Oxfam and others fear the offensive against Brazil and South Africa marks a new determination by the drugs companies to resist the flouting of their patents by poor countries. </p> <p>GlaxoSmithKline has recently threatened legal action against the Indian generics company Cipla, blocking its plans to bring a cheap version of Combivir - AZT and 3TC in one pill - into Uganda and Ghana. \"The implementation of WTO patent rules is taking place against the backdrop of a sustained campaign led by the pharmaceutical industry which may well erode the public health protection provided by safeguard provisions,\" says an Oxfam report published today. </p> <p>In Khayelitsha, a shanty town that sprawls over a vast plain near Cape Town's airport, the Nobel prize-winning volunteer doctors are raising the stakes. They pioneered the use of nevirapine, a drug that stops pregnant women transmitting HIV to their babies. Now the government is rolling out the programme to the entire country. </p> <p>After the period of apostasy, when President Thabo Mbeki upset the medical world by doubting that HIV caused Aids, the government seems willing to seek out and use cheap drugs if it is allowed to. </p> <p>Last year it opened an infectious diseases clinic - code for HIV - where people are offered counselling and treatment for the \"opportunistic infections\" that can kill. They use fluconazole, a strong antibiotic most hospitals lack because of its price, to treat cryptococcal meningitis and thrush. </p> <p>In May, they will take the most radical step of all and start 150 adults and 30 children who are at death's door on antiretrovirals - the very medication that keeps people in the west with HIV alive. Dr Eric Goemaere, head of the South African mission of Med\u00e9cins sans Fronti\u00e8res, sees it as a marker for the future. \"We are here on the frontline to show that it is possible and it will change attitudes totally,\" he says. </p> <p>South Africa could by now be in the relatively advantageous position of Brazil, he believes, making its own cheap drugs and importing others. Perhaps Nokuthula's husband need not have died and Refilwe might be strong. There was a political willingness to use generics in 1997, but Case 4183/98 put a stop to all that. \"I have no hesitation in saying that I'm totally convinced that's exactly where it is,\" Dr Goemaere said. \"The pharmaceutical companies blocked South Africa becoming like Brazil.\" </p> <p>South Africa's director general of health, Ayunda Ntsaluba, says something similar. \"Three years down the road, access to medicines would have been completely different. We would be providing certainly for opportunistic infections, although it would be disingenuous to say we would have been providing triple therapy,\" he said. </p> <p>It is hard to be a doctor in Africa. Herman Reuter, a young South African of German extraction who works for MSF in Khayelitsha, has more medicines at his disposal than most, but he is clearly under strain. Doctors go into the profession to cure the sick, not temporarily staunch their wounds before they die. </p> <p>\"We have our worse days and our better days,\" he says. \"I saw one woman last Friday with a CD4 count of two [very low resistance to infection]. I said we hope to give antiretrovirals by May. She said, 'yes, but doctor, what happens until May?' I see many people die.\" </p> <p>A very sick woman of about 41 had been brought to his clinic that morning by her 18-year-old daughter. She had cryptococcal meningitis. A week earlier, she had been to a government hospital and was turned away. There was nothing they could do for her, they said. They did not have the right medicine. But they mentioned the MSF clinic. </p> <p>Dr Reuter was able to give her fluconazole, which costs around $4 for a 200mg capsule that will, for the moment, save her life. His last resort is to send the very sick to Somerset hospital in Cape Town, where pharmaceutical companies are running trials of drug combinations for HIV. </p> <p>There is a bitter irony in it. The trials cannot be run in Britain or the US where the drugs will eventually be sold because everyone who needs antiretrovirals is on them. Refilwe and Nokuthula have no hope of a trial. Their best chance is to eat well, if they can afford to, to build up their strength and hang on. </p> <p>Refilwe, like the rest of the patients in wards 13 and 16, refuses to accept she has HIV. What is the point when there is no treatment? \"I don't know why I'm sick,\" she says, barely audibly. </p> <p>Nokuthula places all her hope in the traditional healer, David Ngalana, even though he acknowledges he can give her only limited help. A large poster on the wall declares: \"Traditional medicine can cure almost all sicknesses but currently we cannot cure HIV/Aids.\" </p> <p>Nokuthula knows nothing about Aids drugs. There are no antiretrovirals for the people of her township, so they may as well not exist. She will drink her treebark infusions and convince herself they failed to save her husband only because he did not take them properly. In that way, maybe, hope can triumph for a while over despair. </p> <p>\u0095 Tomorrow: Dying for Drugs - how the drug giants flex their global muscle.

      "bodyText": "Refilwe is a spectral figure, so thin that the light from the huge hospital window at her back seems to pass through her. She sits as straight as a knife, all bone, white robe, and huge eyes gazing at nothing, breathing shallowly through an open mouth. She is 30 and has a son of seven. She has tuberculosis and her mouth is covered with the telltale white spots of a common infection she cannot fight off, because HIV is destroying her body's resistance. Ask her how she is and she slowly turns her entire body towards you. \"I'm feeling better,\" she whispers. It is a fiction maintained by the plump and jolly nurses at the Natalspruit hospital outside Johannesburg who have dozens more like her on drips in wards 13 and 16, where anybody with any strength resists going because if you have HIV, you have no future. Refilwe, impossibly, gets to her feet and makes her way with pitiful steps and the arm of a nurse to the door, a walking wraith. She is going to the TB clinic. They will sort out the TB but then they will send her home to die. She is fatally weakened and there are no antiretroviral drugs to take on HIV here. Nokuthula, 23, is also under a death sentence, for all that she appears robust with health. So is her 18-month-old son Sipho, whose name means a gift. The young mother has put herself and her child in the care of the traditional healer in the township outside Natalspruit hospital who gives them herb and bark infusions to make them strong. But traditional medicine could not save Nokuthula's husband, who died of Aids last September. At an age when women in the west are embarking on families and careers, Refilwe and Nokuthula have begun the business of dying. They live in the East Rand suburbs of Johannesburg, South Africa, where one in five is estimated to be harbouring the virus that will kill them. Across Africa and the developing world millions more will die of diseases that are treatable in the west, such as diarrhoea, meningitis, malaria, TB and Aids. The hospitals do what they can, but their best efforts are a sticking plaster on a haemorrhage. The western drugs they need are unaffordable. Life is priced too high. Thirty-five miles away in Pretoria, a legal battle critical to the fate of many more women like Refilwe and Nokuthula, their men and their children, is about to begin. Case number 4183/98 in the South African high court is an action brought by 42 pharmaceutical companies, including the British giant GlaxoSmithKline, against the South African government. The case is an attempt to block South Africa from importing cheap medicines. The drug companies have spent three years and millions of pounds preparing the case. They have retained virtually every patent lawyer in South Africa. On March 5 their barristers will try to stop the South African government from buying the medicines its people so badly need from countries where the prices are lowest, on the grounds that it is infringing world trade agreements. The rest of Africa will be closely watching the outcome of the trial. So will developing countries on other continents. With the death toll from infectious diseases inexorably rising, especially in Africa, a tide of outrage is swelling among local activists and international aid organisations who see medicines denied to the sick in the name of commerce. More than 2.5m people die every year from Aids-related illnesses. More than 13m children have lost one or both parents to the condition. There are more than 32m men, women and children infected by HIV in developing countries. AZT and 3TC, the basic antiretroviral drugs in the west, would keep them alive and well, but the price tag is $10,000 (\u00a37,000) to $15,000 per patient a year. The majority of employed people in South Africa, with whole families to support, earn less than $3,000 a year, and by comparison with most of the rest of the continent, they are rich. But there are now alternatives - cheap copies of life-saving medicines called generics, made mainly in Brazil, India and Thailand whose national laws allow them to ignore drug patents in cases of dire human need. Thailand believes it could reduce the cost to $200 a year per patient. It is a price the South African government might be able to pay for the life of Refilwe and Nokuthula, but the drug companies, in Case 4183/98, afraid of the potential worldwide consequences if their prices start to be undercut, say no. Today in Cape Town at least 5,000 supporters of the successful grassroots Treatment Action Campaign will march on parliament to demand the medicines. At the same time in London, Oxfam is launching an international campaign demanding help for developing countries who want to use legitimate measures to buy or make their own cheap drugs, but who are bullied into submission by the lawyers working for drug companies and by the western governments who support them. The pharmaceutical companies argue that they need 20 years of patent protection to recoup the vast sum it costs to research and develop drugs.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The potentially-poisonous Japanese fugu fish has achieved notoriety, at least among scientists who haven't eaten any, because it has a genome that can be best described as \"concise\". There is no \"junk\" DNA, no waste, no nonsense. You get exactly what it says on the tin. </p> <p>This makes its genome very easy to deal with in the laboratory: it is close to being the perfect genetic instruction set. Take all the genes you need to make an animal and no more, stir, and you'd get fugu. </p> <p>Now, most people would hardly rate the fugu fish as the acme of creation. If it were, it would be eating us, and not the other way round. But here is a paradox. The human genome probably does not contain significantly more genes than the fugu fish. What sets it apart is - and there is no more succinct way to put this - rubbish. </p> <p>The human genome is more than 95% rubbish. Fewer than 5% of the 3.2bn As, Cs, Gs and Ts that make up the human genome are actually found in genes. It is more litter-strewn than any genome completely sequenced so far. It is believed to contain just under 31,780 genes, only about half as many again as found in the simple roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans (19,099 genes): yet in terms of bulk DNA content, the human genome is almost 30 times the size. </p> <p>A lot is just rubbish, plain and simple. But at least half the genome is rubbish of a special kind - transposable elements. These are small segments of DNA that show signs of having once been the genomes of independent entities. Although rather small, they often contain sequences that signal cellular machinery to transcribe them (that is, to switch them on). They may also contain genetic instructions for enzymes whose function is to make copies and insert the copies elsewhere in the genome. These transposable elements litter the human genome in their hundreds of thousands. </p> <p>Many contain genes for an enzyme called reverse transcriptase - essential for a transposable element to integrate itself into the host DNA. The chilling part is that reverse transcriptase is a key feature of retroviruses such as HIV-1, the human immunodeficiency virus. Much of the genome itself - at least half its bulk - may have consisted of DNA that started out, perhaps millions of years ago, as independent viruses or virus-like entities. </p> <p>To make matters worse, hundreds of genes, containing instructions for at least 223 proteins, seem to have been imported directly from bacteria. Some are responsible for features of human metabolism otherwise hard to explain away as quirks of evolution - such as our ability to metabolise psychotropic drugs.

      "bodyText": "The potentially-poisonous Japanese fugu fish has achieved notoriety, at least among scientists who haven't eaten any, because it has a genome that can be best described as \"concise\". There is no \"junk\" DNA, no waste, no nonsense. You get exactly what it says on the tin. This makes its genome very easy to deal with in the laboratory: it is close to being the perfect genetic instruction set. Take all the genes you need to make an animal and no more, stir, and you'd get fugu. Now, most people would hardly rate the fugu fish as the acme of creation. If it were, it would be eating us, and not the other way round. But here is a paradox. The human genome probably does not contain significantly more genes than the fugu fish. What sets it apart is - and there is no more succinct way to put this - rubbish. The human genome is more than 95% rubbish. Fewer than 5% of the 3.2bn As, Cs, Gs and Ts that make up the human genome are actually found in genes. It is more litter-strewn than any genome completely sequenced so far. It is believed to contain just under 31,780 genes, only about half as many again as found in the simple roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans (19,099 genes): yet in terms of bulk DNA content, the human genome is almost 30 times the size. A lot is just rubbish, plain and simple. But at least half the genome is rubbish of a special kind - transposable elements. These are small segments of DNA that show signs of having once been the genomes of independent entities. Although rather small, they often contain sequences that signal cellular machinery to transcribe them (that is, to switch them on). They may also contain genetic instructions for enzymes whose function is to make copies and insert the copies elsewhere in the genome. These transposable elements litter the human genome in their hundreds of thousands. Many contain genes for an enzyme called reverse transcriptase - essential for a transposable element to integrate itself into the host DNA. The chilling part is that reverse transcriptase is a key feature of retroviruses such as HIV-1, the human immunodeficiency virus. Much of the genome itself - at least half its bulk - may have consisted of DNA that started out, perhaps millions of years ago, as independent viruses or virus-like entities. To make matters worse, hundreds of genes, containing instructions for at least 223 proteins, seem to have been imported directly from bacteria. Some are responsible for features of human metabolism otherwise hard to explain away as quirks of evolution - such as our ability to metabolise psychotropic drugs. Thus, monoamine oxidase is involved in metabolising alcohol. If the import of bacterial genes for novel purposes (such as drug resistance) sounds disturbing and familiar, it should - this is precisely the thrust of much research into the genetic modification of organisms in agriculture or biotechnology. So natural-born human beings are, indeed, genetically modified. Self-respecting eco-warriors should never let their children marry a human being, in case the population at large gets contaminated with exotic genes! One of the most common transposable elements in the human genome is called Alu - the genome is riddled with it. What the draft genome now shows quite clearly is that copies of Alu tend to cluster where there are genes. The density of genes in the genome varies, and where there are more genes, there are more copies of Alu. Nobody knows why, yet it is consistent with the idea that Alu has a positive benefit for genomes. To be extremely speculative, it could be that a host of very similar looking Alu sequences in gene-rich regions could facilitate the kind of gene-shuffling that peps up natural genetic variation, and with that, evolution.

The 2001 collection shows just how far Dr Marten manufacturer R Griggs of Woolaston, Northamptonshire, has come. It includes sandals, mules and sports shoes in pink, burnt orange, aubergine, violet and turquoise. However, after 40 years the classic 1460 model boot in black, is still very much in demand. Invented by R Griggs in 1959 after discussions with German doctors, the first pair of air-cushioned 1460s was made in 1960. By 1967 skinheads had adopted the boot as official footwear and by 1979, with the release of cult movie Quadrophenia, mods started wearing the brand. In the 1980s DMs were immortalised by Alexei Sayle in a song on comedy classic The Young Ones, an appearance that cemented the boots as student favourites. By the mid-1990s the company introduced sandals to the range, which attracted the attention of the fashion pack, and in 1999 a pair of DM boots were displayed in the Millennium Dome as a design classic. The boots have been worn by decades of rock stars including the Clash, the Sex Pistols, Madness, Iggy Pop, the Who, the late Ian Dury, Idlewild, the Prodigy, PJ Harvey and Asian Dub Foundation. The brand's historical relationship to music was celebrated last year as part of its 40th birthday celebrations, with the release of a 40-track, CD box set bound in authentic red DM leather featuring the distinctive AirWair tag.

      "body": "<p>The second world war took Stanley Harrison, who has died aged 87, from Caversham to Cairo; the cold war took him to a job with a communist press agency in Prague, and to the forests of Bohemia. From 1966 to 1979, as the Morning Star's chief sub editor, he helped to train a generation of radical journalists - who scattered far beyond the communist daily - and in 1974 as an author, he wrote Poor Men's Guardians, on the struggle for a democratic newspaper press from 1763-1973. </p> <p>Harrison was the antithesis of the apparatchik. A working-class Yorkshireman, he won a scholarship to Jesus College, Oxford, where he read history and modern languages, of which Spanish was his preferred tongue. As a labour of love he translated Lope de Vega's play Fuenteovejuna, and it was performed at London's left-wing Unity Theatre. </p> <p>During the war he worked at the government's Caversham monitoring service before the Cairo posting, where he listened to broadcasts from the Balkans. There he met his wife, Gina, a fiery and beautiful Croat. </p> <p>It was the Communist party which sent Harrison to Prague, and Telepress agency, where one day, he recalled, men in mackintoshes arrived and closed it down. The Harrisons were exiled for six months to the Bohemian forests - he learned a lot about gathering and cooking mushrooms. </p> <p>Eventually Harrison and Gina returned to England, where he became a sub editor on the Daily Worker - the Morning Star's predecessor - and Gina worked at Collet's, the left-wing bookshop in Charing Cross Road. Harrison worked with Allen Hutt, the legendary chief sub, who repeatedly won the Worker the annual newspaper design award - usually with pages Harrison had conceived. Gina left the CP over the 1956 Soviet intervention in Hungary but Harrison laboured on. In 1966 he succeeded Hutt as chief sub. Post-retirement he was for a time London correspondent of an Athens socialist newspaper. </p> <p>In retirement, the couple left Highbury in north London (where Harrison used to go swimming with Jack Straw in the open-air pool) and settled in Brighton. Gina became a star of the local Labour Party and Harrison edited the Brighton and Hove Democratic Left's bulletin.

      "bodyText": "The second world war took Stanley Harrison, who has died aged 87, from Caversham to Cairo; the cold war took him to a job with a communist press agency in Prague, and to the forests of Bohemia. From 1966 to 1979, as the Morning Star's chief sub editor, he helped to train a generation of radical journalists - who scattered far beyond the communist daily - and in 1974 as an author, he wrote Poor Men's Guardians, on the struggle for a democratic newspaper press from 1763-1973. Harrison was the antithesis of the apparatchik. A working-class Yorkshireman, he won a scholarship to Jesus College, Oxford, where he read history and modern languages, of which Spanish was his preferred tongue. As a labour of love he translated Lope de Vega's play Fuenteovejuna, and it was performed at London's left-wing Unity Theatre. During the war he worked at the government's Caversham monitoring service before the Cairo posting, where he listened to broadcasts from the Balkans. There he met his wife, Gina, a fiery and beautiful Croat. It was the Communist party which sent Harrison to Prague, and Telepress agency, where one day, he recalled, men in mackintoshes arrived and closed it down. The Harrisons were exiled for six months to the Bohemian forests - he learned a lot about gathering and cooking mushrooms. Eventually Harrison and Gina returned to England, where he became a sub editor on the Daily Worker - the Morning Star's predecessor - and Gina worked at Collet's, the left-wing bookshop in Charing Cross Road. Harrison worked with Allen Hutt, the legendary chief sub, who repeatedly won the Worker the annual newspaper design award - usually with pages Harrison had conceived. Gina left the CP over the 1956 Soviet intervention in Hungary but Harrison laboured on. In 1966 he succeeded Hutt as chief sub. Post-retirement he was for a time London correspondent of an Athens socialist newspaper. In retirement, the couple left Highbury in north London (where Harrison used to go swimming with Jack Straw in the open-air pool) and settled in Brighton. Gina became a star of the local Labour Party and Harrison edited the Brighton and Hove Democratic Left's bulletin. They raised money, and consciousness, for the people of Bosnia as their beloved Yugoslavia went up in flames. Harrison became an open-air speaker in his 70s to oppose the Falklands adventure and the gulf war. Their home meanwhile was an ecumenical - and gastronomic - meeting place for their broad family of friends. Gina died in 1998. Harrison is survived by a daughter, Susan, two granddaughters and two great grandchildren. Stanley Harrison, journalist, born August 1, 1913; died December 26, 2000",

Rising from the site of a former sewage treatment plant, the 82-home BedZed scheme in Sutton, Surrey, is the first real attempt by architects and developers to build a \"green\" housing estate in Britain - though there are many examples of one-off eco-friendly homes. </p> <p>BedZed is the brainchild of architect Bill Dunster (who lives in his own eco-friendly house nearby), the affordable housing agency the Peabody Trust and the environmental charity BioRegional. Some way from completion, the scheme has already attracted more than 1,000 potential house buyers, although a third of the 82 live-work terrace homes have been set aside as low-rent social housing. The fact that so many people have expressed an interest in this quietly revolutionary housing estate is encouraging not only to the architects and their clients, but to anyone concerned about the future of housing. Ever-expanding suburbia has gobbled up and often ruined much of Britain, notably the south-east. Sutton is at the heart of this greedy suburban sprawl. </p> <p>It's not as if the suburbs are all they are cracked up to be. Those hoping to find a bit of rural peace and quiet away from city centres often find themselves in houses that waste land and greedily consume energy. They are also often completely dependent on cars - living in a petrol-driven subtopia rather than a William Morris-style rural utopia. One of the greatest problems facing the experts brought in to help London mayor Ken Livingstone formulate a rational transport policy for Greater London is the huge increase in suburban traffic. </p> <p>\"What we need to learn,\" suggests Bill Dunster, \"is to live more closely together and, where possible, to live and work without having to commute. This means the creation of more densely packed homes in suburbia, homes with built-in workspaces. Of course, this arrangement won't appeal to everyone, but the fact that so many people have expressed interest in living at BedZed is some sort of proof that we're working along the right lines.\" One of the clever things about the Dunster-designed houses is that they are a soft Modern architecture; with their gently curved roofs and construction of brick and timber, they clearly appeal to those for whom a mock Tudor or neo-Georgian house would be the normal choice, the ideal home. Arranged in elegant terraces of six three-storey homes, the houses are a contem porary take on traditional Georgian row housing. They occupy the least possible acreage, but even so they have balconies and roof gardens as well as conventional back gardens - and the bonus of office-workshops. </p> <p>In town planning terms, the BedZed development shows how suburbia can become more responsible than it has been to date, how it can organise itself more efficiently, use considerably less energy and, as far as possible, shed its reliance on the car. Built into the estate is an all-electric car pool; this makes it possible for future residents to forgo car ownership and to make short trips to shops, schools and station by quiet cars that use little energy. Of course they have to get power from somewhere, so the estate incorporates a combined heat and power plant that uses tree waste as fuel. This will produce all the energy needed to power the estate and its pool of electric cars. Dunster's environmental consultants tell him that houses on the estate will expend 90 per cent less energy than an average British family home. There will be, as far as technologically possible, no emission of carbon-laced exhaust gases. </p> <p>As for the energy needed to build the estate, this has been kept to a minimum by sourcing all necessary materials within three miles of the site. Wherever possible, materials are recycled. \"There is nothing new in the structure of the houses,\" says Dunster, \"but we've tried to ensure that their initial environmental cost is low and that they will be cheap to run and maintain.\" </p> <p>By shaping houses that might appeal to anyone and not just those (by far the minority in Britain) in search of a modern, architect-designed home, Richard McCarthy, chief executive of the Peabody Trust and chairman of the National Housing Federation, hopes to create a demand for low-energy homes. To get people to give up the dream of a mock-Tudor pile will take some doing by the likes of the forward-looking McCarthy. Yet if he can woo house-hunters into living and working in a suburban update of the urban Georgian terrace, then suburbia may yet be green. </p> <p>Ken Livingstone's environment commission, set up last year to advise the mayor on the \"greening\" of London, commended the scheme last week as a model that all other house builders and developers might follow. The commission calls for, among other things, a halt to the loss of open spaces and playing fields in Greater London as well as a London-wide programme of tree-planting. This is encouraging.

Locals, convinced it is still viable, had hoped to see it taken over by an independent operator.</p> <p>\"This is an interesting, much loved building, still being used for the purpose it was designed for when it opened in 1921, and heavily used by local people,\" said Hattie Appleby, one of the campaigners who have launched a Keep Cinema Local campaign to alert other communities to the threat. \"To discover that it has been sold with this covenant is just a tragedy.\"</p> <p>The ABC was listed by English Heritage two years ago to save it from the threat of demolition, but there is no statutory power to preserve it in cinema use - unlike theatres, which can have change of use only after a public inquiry.</p> <p>The Bristol cinema was listed as English Heritage launched a national survey to find the remaining gems.</p> <p>Many cinemas which were saved by conversion into bingo halls are now in danger again as the game becomes less popular. Ironically, the new threat to local cinemas comes from the renewed popularity of cinemagoing. The fate of the Bristol cinema seems to have been sealed by last year's merger between the ABC and Odeon chains. The group does not see the future in small local cinemas, on tight inner city sites, which cannot be expanded into multi-screen complexes and often have little or no parking.</p> <p>It has emerged that restrictive covenants such as the Bristol one, intended to protect the chains from potential local competition, have become standard in disposing of local cinemas.</p> <p>Although the Odeon group, which since last year's merger now includes ABC, refused to discuss such contracts, the developer who has bought the Bristol site has already bought eight other former cinemas from the group, all with restrictive covenants.</p> <p>Richard Gray, chairman of the Cinema Theatres Association, which campaigns nationally for the preservation of both the buildings and their cinema use, is alarmed at the trend.</p> <p>\"The right of the chains to impose such a covenant has never been challenged in law, and we would welcome a test case,\" Mr Gray said.</p> <p>The listed former ABC cinema at Walthamstow, east London, and another at Gravesend have been sold to an Asian businessman with a covenant barring him from showing anything except Asian films.</p> <p>These cinemas have been enthusiastically supported, but report that their audiences would also like to see a wider range of films.

Locals, convinced it is still viable, had hoped to see it taken over by an independent operator. \"This is an interesting, much loved building, still being used for the purpose it was designed for when it opened in 1921, and heavily used by local people,\" said Hattie Appleby, one of the campaigners who have launched a Keep Cinema Local campaign to alert other communities to the threat. \"To discover that it has been sold with this covenant is just a tragedy.\" The ABC was listed by English Heritage two years ago to save it from the threat of demolition, but there is no statutory power to preserve it in cinema use - unlike theatres, which can have change of use only after a public inquiry. The Bristol cinema was listed as English Heritage launched a national survey to find the remaining gems. Many cinemas which were saved by conversion into bingo halls are now in danger again as the game becomes less popular. Ironically, the new threat to local cinemas comes from the renewed popularity of cinemagoing. The fate of the Bristol cinema seems to have been sealed by last year's merger between the ABC and Odeon chains. The group does not see the future in small local cinemas, on tight inner city sites, which cannot be expanded into multi-screen complexes and often have little or no parking. It has emerged that restrictive covenants such as the Bristol one, intended to protect the chains from potential local competition, have become standard in disposing of local cinemas. Although the Odeon group, which since last year's merger now includes ABC, refused to discuss such contracts, the developer who has bought the Bristol site has already bought eight other former cinemas from the group, all with restrictive covenants. Richard Gray, chairman of the Cinema Theatres Association, which campaigns nationally for the preservation of both the buildings and their cinema use, is alarmed at the trend. \"The right of the chains to impose such a covenant has never been challenged in law, and we would welcome a test case,\" Mr Gray said. The listed former ABC cinema at Walthamstow, east London, and another at Gravesend have been sold to an Asian businessman with a covenant barring him from showing anything except Asian films. These cinemas have been enthusiastically supported, but report that their audiences would also like to see a wider range of films. Film societies have approached them to show other films, but the covenant forbids it.

      "bodyText": "Legacy, the group seeking to buy the Millennium Dome, expects its bid to be accepted by the government this week, after inviting the Duke of Westminster to join the consortium. The group, fronted by Labour donor Robert Bourne and dominated by Irish-based Treasury Holdings, said last night it was confident of securing ministerial approval to take over the project. Legacy's prospects of clinching a deal to turn the site into a hi-tech business park surrounded by houses, pubs, and shops rose last week after it bowed to pressure and agreed to seek new partners. Talks were continuing last night with the duke's privately owned Grosvenor Estates and property firm Quintain, plus another unnamed British firm. The consortium declined to disclose whether Grosvenor, Quintain or the other British firm was likely to take a stake in the venture, as a Grosvenor source confirmed that discussions were underway. But Legacy predicted that its offer would be approved in principle on Thursday by a cabinet committee led by the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, and the dome minister, Lord Falconer. The Duke of Westminster is the country's richest aristocrat, worth an estimated \u00a33.75bn, and owner of 300 acres in Mayfair and Belgravia, and is reported to be considering a 25% stake. His involvement risks fuelling public criticism that a landmark building and 63 acres of land, into which have been pumped more than \u00a3800m of public money, is to be sold for around \u00a3125m. Unless the Legacy bid collapses in the next few days, ministers are expected to extend Wednesday's deadline by up to a month to complete the transfer after Tony Blair made clear he wants to be rid of the dome before the election. Mr Bourne, due to meet the government's competition advisers on Wednesday, is also expected to disclose that the building giant, Sir Robert McAlpine, has agreed to join Legacy, after declining a stake last month. Four months of negotiations since Legacy was nominated \"preferred bidder\" last November, when the Japanese bank Nomura pulled out, have been dogged by rows. The government has insisted on clawback clauses to share in future profits if the site is sold on. It feared it was vulnerable to Tory attacks over Legacy unless the make-up of the consortium was broadened. Mr Bourne has donated \u00a3100,000 to Labour, handing over the last tranche of the cash after expressing an interest in the dome, and has also supported the culture secretary, Chris Smith's Islington South constituency. Treasury Holdings has been involved in political and business dealings in Ireland. Mr Prescott is believed to have asked architect Lord Rogers of Riverside to head a committee to advise the government on how the rest of the Greenwich peninsula should be developed. Ministers must also decide on Thursday whether a four-day auction of the dome's contents, intended to raise up to \u00a34m, opens as planned on February 27. The sale will be postponed if the Legacy deal collapses, as the government has promised to keep the dome as an entertainment venue until its future is decided.",

Mr Racan pledged to stand firm behind the rule of law, but the eruption orchestrated by hardline heirs of the late authoritarian president, Franjo Tudjman, suggested a rightwing attempt to topple the government elected a year ago. \"It would be exaggerated to speak of an attempted coup d'etat,\" Mr Mesic said, [but] \"what is happening is organised destruction, a premeditated scenario.

Senior officials in Belgrade yesterday stressed again that they would not extradite Slobodan Milosevic, the deposed Yugoslav president and indicted war criminal, to the UN war crimes tribunal in the Hague. The Split rally was triggered by a manhunt for a Croatian general who is suspected of being involved in the murder of dozens of Serb civilians in the 1991 war of independence. Retired general Mirko Norac, the wartime commander of Croatian forces in Gospic, south-west of Zagreb, went missing on Thursday after prosecutors said they wanted to question him about the abduction and murder of some 40 Serb civilians in the region in October 1991. To nationalists, Gen Norac is a war hero who helped defend Croatia against Serb rebels and the Yugoslav army in 1991. Six men have been in detention since last year in connection with the murders.

      "bodyText": "Former president Bill Clinton was yesterday involved in fresh controversy over his last-minute granting of pardons and commutations of sentences, when it emerged that the father of a freed cocaine dealer had contributed heavily to the Democratic party after his son's conviction. The revelation will increase the growing scepticism about the motives for the pardons, which were granted in the dying hours of the Clinton administration last month. Carlos Vignali, 30, who served six years of a 15-year sentence for federal narcotics violations, was freed following the commutation by Mr Clinton. He was convicted in 1994 for being part of a ring that transported 800lb of cocaine from California to Minnesota to convert into crack. The decision to release a major drug dealer raised eyebrows, although attention has earlier focussed on other controversial pardons, such as that of the financier Marc Rich, and of Mr Clinton's brother who had been convicted on a cocaine charge. It has emerged that Carlos Vignali's father, Horacio, a Los Angeles entrepreneur, became a major political donor in the years after his son's arrest, giving more than $160,000 to state and federal officeholders, including the current Democratic governor of California, Gray Davis, who is a likely contender for the party's 2004 presidential nomination. Mr Vignali's father told the Los Angeles Times that the freeing of his son was \"a miracle\". He had not written to the president to ask for his help, \"but I thank God, and I thank the president every day\". Others were more sceptical. \"It's not plausible, it makes no sense at all,\" said Margaret Love, the lawyer who oversaw all justice department reviews of presidential clemency applications from 1990 to 1997. \"Somebody had to help him. There is no way that case could have possibly succeeded in the department of justice.\" Craig Cascarano, a lawyer for one of Mr Vignali's 30 co-defendants, many of them poor and black, said: \"How is it that Carlos Vignali is out eating a nice dinner while my client is still in prison eating bologna sandwiches?\" A federal prosecutor who had urged the justice department to reject clemency for Mr Vignali demanded an explanation. The judge who sentenced him was also furious.

      "bodyText": "Armenian visit fuels row The first state visit to France by an Armenian president starts today amid high and rising tension between France and Turkey. In January the French parliament decided to recognise as genocide the mass killing of Armenians in eastern Turkey in 1915. The vote, opposed by France's president, prime minister and most of the business community, prompted Turkey to recall its ambassador to Paris, cancel dozens of deals with French companies and ban them from tendering for Turkish contracts. One Nation tips the balance The Australian Labor party won a three-seat majority in Western Australia's state election yesterday, after the ruling conservative coalition lost votes to the controversial One Nation party, led by Pauline Hanson. One Nation, which runs on an anti-immigration platform, won more than 9% of the vote, and its strategy of instructing supporters to put sitting MPs last on the preferential ballot papers helped unseat at least 12 coalition members. McVeigh wants TV execution Timothy McVeigh, convicted of the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 which killed 168 people, wants his execution by lethal injection to be shown on public television. McVeigh said in a letter published yesterday in the newspaper The Oklahoman that he did not object to a closed-circuit broadcast of his execution on May 16, but questioned how such a telecast could allow equal access to the 250 people who have expressed an interest in watching.",

A terrible earthquake, thousands dead, a million homeless - and a governmental machine that simply failed to cope. The chill of the crisis, for a visitor from Britain, is one of recognition. It is the red tape that binds. </p> <p>Caveats first. Any nation, no matter how developed, would have struggled to cope with the quake that rocked Gujarat. The help flooding in from abroad has been magnificent. The reaction from New Delhi has gathered momentum. There has been a formidable rallying round, a sharing of grief and resolve. This is not a story for shame: when the earth shakes, the flimsy constructs of grinding poverty collapse. You may even take the predictable outrages in your stride.

You return to a Britain where an NHS culture of \"arrogance born of indifference\" saw a hundred babies die from botched heart operations, where customs and excise has just lost \u00a3668m on a sting, where the aftershocks of BSE linger, where the throngs of asylum seekers awaiting a decision on their fate swells exponentially, where the crazily privatised trains don't run on time. </p> <p>It is no secret that Tony Blair, after four years at the top, is depressed and infuriated by our own civil service's inability to deliver.

      "bodyText": "It has been impossible to travel in India, these past three disastrous weeks, and not feel chilled by one special aftershock of tragedy. A terrible earthquake, thousands dead, a million homeless - and a governmental machine that simply failed to cope. The chill of the crisis, for a visitor from Britain, is one of recognition. It is the red tape that binds. Caveats first. Any nation, no matter how developed, would have struggled to cope with the quake that rocked Gujarat. The help flooding in from abroad has been magnificent. The reaction from New Delhi has gathered momentum. There has been a formidable rallying round, a sharing of grief and resolve. This is not a story for shame: when the earth shakes, the flimsy constructs of grinding poverty collapse. You may even take the predictable outrages in your stride. There were always going to be fly-by-night property developers who built frail apartment blocks; there were always going to be seedy operators at Ahmedabad railway station who wanted their palms greased before letting the blankets, tents and medicines through. What is harder to bear is the crushing weight of inert bureaucracy. Could a Japanese team get its relief supplies out of the airport?

      "bodyText": "British football fans may have to pay to watch teams such as Brazil, Argentina and France on television during next year's World Cup final tournament under controversial plans to sell rights to their matches to pay-per-view channels. Kirch, a German company which holds the European television rights to the 2002 and 2006 World Cup finals claims that it does not have to honour British legislation that all matches in the tournament must be televised live on free-to-air channels, giving all football fans the chance to see the world's leading teams. Kirch, claims that it bought the rights to the two tournaments prior to the government's decision to list the World Cup as one of several sports events of national importance that must be screened live on a free-to-air basis under the 1996 Broadcasting Act. The culture minister, Chris Smith, has written to Kirch outlining the law and insisting that the entire World Cup must be shown either on ITV or BBC television. The company continues to challenge the ruling and is planning an auction sale of the rights, which will be open to all broadcasters, pay-per-view as well as free-to-air, and this could result in court action between Kirch and the government. If Kirch is successful the spectacle of next year's World Cup in Korea and Japan could be ruined for thousands of British football fans watching it at home with many matches shown on BSkyB or ONDigital. For many, the main attraction of a World Cup is the opportunity to watch teams such as Brazil on free television. The row between Kirch and the government stems from a directive from Fifa, world football's governing body that only matches involving the national team of a country have to be shown on free-to-air television along with the opening match of a World Cup tournament, semi-finals and finals. All other matches can be sold to the highest bidder. Kirch insists that it bought the rights to the 2002 and 2006 World Cup finals in 1996, prior to the introduction of the Broadcasting Act of the same year which contains a list of protected sports events that must be shown on free-to-air television. The other events are the FA Cup final, the Grand National, the Olympic Games, the Derby, Wimbledon, rugby league and rugby union World Cup finals and the Scottish FA Cup final. Kirch has said that it plans to sell World Cup television rights to the highest bidder in Britain over the coming months and that an auction will take place between rival companies.

It is not the intention of Kirch to deny any football fans in the UK from watching these matches.\" The statement adds: \"The auction process and rights available will be open to all forms of broadcasters whether free-to-air television or pay television.\" The government insists it drew up its protected events list in 1985, which was reviewed in 1991, and the fact that it is contained in the 1996 Broadcasting Act, prior to Kirch's buying of the rights, is irrelevant. In a letter to Kirch, Mr Smith wrote that the listed events apply to all broadcasters regardless of when they bought sports rights for a particular event. Mr Smith added: \"I very much hope that the proposed sale of the rights in question will be done in accordance with the provisions of our legislation, so that British people will continue to be able to watch the whole of the finals tournament live on a free-to-air public service broadcasting platform.\" The Independent Television Commission has also become involved in the dispute and has warned Kirch that all World Cup matches must be shown on free-to-air television otherwise the matter may have to be taken to court. In a letter to Kirch, the ITC stated: \"That Kirch purchased the rights to the 2002 World Cup prior to the 1996 Act coming into force is therefore irrelevant. In any event, Kirch should have been aware of the fact that the tournament was included on the UK list of events of national importance.\"",

      "body": "<p>Murder hunt detectives are checking rings worn by neighbours of a pensioner who suffocated in a fire at the locked and boarded-up house where he had tried to hide from paedophile-hunting vigilantes.</p> <p>Evidence in the graffiti-sprayed council flat of Alfred Wilkins, 67, a retired trawlerman, is thought to include possible injuries to the body from jewellery in a struggle, according to residents on the Yarborough estate in Grimsby, Lincolnshire.

      "bodyText": "Murder hunt detectives are checking rings worn by neighbours of a pensioner who suffocated in a fire at the locked and boarded-up house where he had tried to hide from paedophile-hunting vigilantes. Evidence in the graffiti-sprayed council flat of Alfred Wilkins, 67, a retired trawlerman, is thought to include possible injuries to the body from jewellery in a struggle, according to residents on the Yarborough estate in Grimsby, Lincolnshire. Six local people have been arrested and police were still questioning three teenagers last night about the death of the mild but heavy-drinking father of three, who had been targeted after a jury acquitted him of indecently assaulting a nine-year-old girl. Mr Wilkins was taken to hospital with a head wound following an earlier attack by youths on his flat, his windows were smashed, and he was followed and shouted at. His body was found on Saturday beside the remains of his dog, Lucky, which children had often gone to pet and feed before the court case in November. Humberside police said that forensic evidence suggested that someone had deliberately started a fire in the house, whose boarded-up windows - painted with the word \"nonce\" (sex offender) - prevented smoke from seeping out. Three men were arrested shortly afterwards and released after questioning, but detectives last night were still interviewing an 18-year-old youth and a 16-year-old girl, both arrested on Saturday, and a 19-year-old youth who was held yesterday. Police confirmed that the death was being treated as murder. They also appealed for a woman to come forward who rang the force on Saturday night from a telephone kiosk, saying she had information. But by the time a police car arrived, she had vanished. The father of the child involved in the court case, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said that he had gone to the police after hearing about the fire. He said: \"I didn't do it, but I knew it wouldn't be long before I got a knock on my door.\" Mr Wilkins was cleared at Grimsby crown court on three counts of assault. The case came shortly after national publicity about residents' protests against alleged paedophiles on a Southampton estate. Grimsby council had been planning to rehouse Mr Wilkins later this spring.",

      "bodyText": "Cave rescue teams and police recovered the bodies of two potholers yesterday from a warren of underground passages in the Pennines which have a history of sudden flooding. The victims were found trapped in Ireby Fell cavern near Kirkby Lonsdale, on the border between North Yorkshire, Lancashire and Cumbria, after their families rang police when they failed to return home. They were named last night by North Yorkshire police as Ray Lea, 58, of Darlington, county Durham, and Julian Carroll, 29, of Tyne and Wear. The two men had driven down from the north-east to explore the cave which plunges down a series of steep waterfalls before narrowing into a series of crawls ending in the first of six sumps, or permanently flooded passages accessible only to cave divers. The cave was blocked for eight years after 1954, when a sudden storm and rain deluge caused an underground landslip which sealed the shakehole, or entrance chamber, where a small stream vanishes from the flank of Leck Fell. Cavers from the Northern Pennine Club dug a way through in 1961 and the cave has become a favourite for training, but the menace of flash-flooding remains a hazard in bad weather. A spokesman for North Yorkshire police said: \"In the early hours of Sunday morning, two cavers were reported as having not returned home by family members. A search was instigated and the cavers' car was found near Masongill, close to the Lancashire-North Yorkshire border.\" Rescue teams checked the two mile track and footpath to the cavern, one of a number of potholes which form a linked but part-flooded system beneath Leck and Ireby fells. In pouring rain, they discovered a stack of caving equipment close to the first, nine metre high waterfall, which leads to a tougher, 12 metre drop. The bodies were found shortly afterwards but atrocious weather for most of the morning made a recovery attempt too dangerous. The police said that a fully equipped team eventually went back into the cave yesterday afternoon. The spokesman said: \"The two bodies have been recovered and we are in the process of transferring them into the hands of undertakers who will be transferring them to the mortuary at the Royal Lancaster infirmary later.\" Ireby Fell cavern includes two route deviations for potholers in trouble because of rising water, but heavy rain gives them little time. The last caving fatality in the area was at Quaking Pot on Ingleborough fell in 1996, when a 24-year-old woman slipped off a climbing ladder and died after falling 40 ft.",

No doubt in other contexts - for example, the right to make unrestrained profits - she regards herself as a libertarian.

Joe Mantegna is a good cop uncovering an anti-Semitic conspiracy which forces him back to his own Jewish roots in a godforsaken world. William H Macy is his hard, unsympathetic partner. </p> <p><strong> Payback </strong> (Brian Helgeland,1998) 10pm, Sky Premier <br>Mel Gibson had a falling out with director Helgeland, replacing him to reshoot and add new scenes to a thriller that isn't as hardboiled as it would like to be. It's a rerun of Point Blank, John Boorman's version of Richard Stark's novel The Hunter, with Gibson trying to fill the weighty Lee Marvin role as a hard-as-coffin-nails hood who is double-crossed, left for dead and returns to get even with the Outfit: \"I just want my money back.\" Veterans Kris Kristofferson and James Coburn are among the heavies. </p> <p><strong> Casino</strong> (Martin Scorsese, 1995) 1.55am, FilmFour <br>The very essence of Scorsese: the story of a Las Vegas casino, and the mob men who milk it dry, told with audacious sweeps of the camera and unflinching gazes into the dark shadows behind the glittering facade. Robert De Niro is Ace, a Jewish gambler who is installed as owner of the Tangiers and finds every single day a struggle for survival. It's certainly another deeply impressive performance, but De Niro is upstaged by Sharon Stone's junkie hooker, Ginger. With James Woods doing hard, Joe Pesci doing crazy, it all seems a little familiar, perhaps even soulless, but this film is also a brutally compelling tale of greed and corruption. <br><strong> Paul Howlett </strong> </p> <p><strong> Sports </strong></p> <p><strong> Premiership Football</strong> 7pm, Sky Sports 1 <br> If you're not a football fan, leave the country now. And don't bother going anywhere else in Europe, either. After a winter break, European football is back in all its slightly dubious glory and there's very little you can do about it. To get you in the mood, there's West Ham v Coventry in our very own Premiership. This is a warning.<br> <strong> Simon Burnton </strong></p> <p><strong>Lifestyle </strong></p> <p><strong> Star Treatment</strong> 9am, 5.10pm, Living <br>Have you ever wondered just who it was who glued Julia Roberts' hair extensions onto her scalp for that Notting Hill look? Or spent the weekend pondering where Coronation Street's Tracey Shaw likes to shop for her designer gear to wear to that oh-so-crucial 40th anniversary party? Or asked yourself which members-only boutique Naomi Campbell once got thrown out of? Well, don't worry, because answers to all these burning issues of the day will be answered in this fluffy early morning/late afternoon show that seems to be aiming for the Style Challenge audience. Unfortunately, they don't seem to be treating us to that many stars (well, OK, Boyzone's Shane Lynch does pop up), although future episodes promise Dani Behr, and Dermot O'Leary getting a full-body massage. <br><strong> Richard Vine</strong> </p>",

It's a rerun of Point Blank, John Boorman's version of Richard Stark's novel The Hunter, with Gibson trying to fill the weighty Lee Marvin role as a hard-as-coffin-nails hood who is double-crossed, left for dead and returns to get even with the Outfit: \"I just want my money back.\" Veterans Kris Kristofferson and James Coburn are among the heavies. Casino (Martin Scorsese, 1995) 1.55am, FilmFour The very essence of Scorsese: the story of a Las Vegas casino, and the mob men who milk it dry, told with audacious sweeps of the camera and unflinching gazes into the dark shadows behind the glittering facade. Robert De Niro is Ace, a Jewish gambler who is installed as owner of the Tangiers and finds every single day a struggle for survival. It's certainly another deeply impressive performance, but De Niro is upstaged by Sharon Stone's junkie hooker, Ginger. With James Woods doing hard, Joe Pesci doing crazy, it all seems a little familiar, perhaps even soulless, but this film is also a brutally compelling tale of greed and corruption. Paul Howlett Sports Premiership Football 7pm, Sky Sports 1 If you're not a football fan, leave the country now. And don't bother going anywhere else in Europe, either. After a winter break, European football is back in all its slightly dubious glory and there's very little you can do about it. To get you in the mood, there's West Ham v Coventry in our very own Premiership. This is a warning. Simon Burnton Lifestyle Star Treatment 9am, 5.10pm, Living Have you ever wondered just who it was who glued Julia Roberts' hair extensions onto her scalp for that Notting Hill look? Or spent the weekend pondering where Coronation Street's Tracey Shaw likes to shop for her designer gear to wear to that oh-so-crucial 40th anniversary party? Or asked yourself which members-only boutique Naomi Campbell once got thrown out of? Well, don't worry, because answers to all these burning issues of the day will be answered in this fluffy early morning/late afternoon show that seems to be aiming for the Style Challenge audience. Unfortunately, they don't seem to be treating us to that many stars (well, OK, Boyzone's Shane Lynch does pop up), although future episodes promise Dani Behr, and Dermot O'Leary getting a full-body massage.

      "body": "<p>From Madame Bovary to Brookside, adultery is one of the most popular dramatic plot-lines. School and marriage are the two things which any given artistic audience is most likely to have experienced. But, in a society where illicit lovers are unlikely to be denounced from the pulpit or paraded around town wearing a scarlet letter A, writers are increasingly seeking ways to raise the risk and shame factors. In ITV's impressive recent drama The Innocent, a husband's fling with his wife's best friend brought an accusation of rape against him. </p> <p>Now, in Best Of Both Worlds - a new three-parter from Paul Abbot, writer of the superb Clocking Off and Touching Evil - adultery leads to bigamy. If this narrative escalation carries on, there'll soon be a Sunday night serial called A Man's Best Friend about a spouse who is secretly dating a labrador. </p> <p>Bigamy was also the subject of a recent best-selling novel - Anita Shreve's The Pilot's Wife - in which an airline captain was discovered to have a pair of slippers by the bed on either side of the Atlantic. And, strikingly, the character with the crowded ring-finger in Best Of Both Worlds also works in the flight business. This cultural connection between bigamy and aeroplanes probably results from the general belief that air crew have more sex than most people, and the fact that flight schedules make it plausible to maintain a life in two different cities simultaneously. </p> <p>The stereotypical bigamist is a shifty middle-aged man; one of those cads from the 1940s and 1950s who maintained parallel homes with rich widows in several seaside towns. I once lived in a village where a man who scarcely seemed strong enough to run one household was said to have told his wife on his deathbed about a second missus living across town. Renowned locally as someone who frequently travelled, he had in reality almost never spent a night away from home. He had given the two children from each marriage the same names to reduce the risk of slipping up on birthday cards. </p> <p>In Best Of Both Worlds, however, the bigamist is a wife twice over. Diane (Alice Evans) is a stewardess on the London-Bologna route. In England, she has a husband, a son and shares in a family restaurant. One day, an Italian flying home - Mark (Cal McCanich) - asks a strange favour. In order to secure a business deal, he needs to have a wife. Diane agrees to play the part. This may be a complicated pick-up, but she increases the complexity by telling him she's single. When, after an illicit affair which he believes to be licit, her Italian lover proposes, Diane accepts. </p> <p>During most of this, the viewer feels as surprised as the congregation at Elton John's wedding, but the series is driven less by psychology than by plot. The primary aim is to make sexual betrayal more complicated. Whereas lovers are deceiving only one person, the bigamist is keeping a secret from two. Even a spy who's a double agent is known to be such by one of the sides. So it's no surprise that the best-known piece of bigamist fiction - Ray Cooney's play Run For Your Wife - is a farce. The form depends on the threat of the door opening at the wrong time. Think how many doors there are in two homes. </p> <p>Abbot luxuriates in the ridiculous convolutions. Fearing that their marriage is cooling because he lacks romance, Diane's English husband surprises her by turning up on one of the flights to her Bologna home. Having told her Italian husband that she has a flat in London, Diane has just a few hours, when he announces a visit, to fit out the house of her recently dead mother to resemble the flat of a single flight attendant. The fact that Diane has to be given a just-dead mum to bequeath her property, and that the threatened meeting of her two husbands at the airport is prevented by a lucky coincidence, shows the way in which the story is force-fed rather than organic. </p> <p>But, within an unlikely situation, the dialogue frequently sounds right. Abbot especially enjoys giving his characters lines of unknowing irony. </p> <p>\"You're a different person out here\", says Diane's English husband on his visit to Bologna. When she first meets her Italian relatives, Diane compliments Mark: \"You've got a lovely family.\" He replies \"So have you\", meaning that she is now part of his, but accidentally acknowledging her history in England. These - neatly - are lines which have a double life. </p> <p>What Best Of Both Worlds fails to provide, at least in its first two episodes, is a psychological explanation of parallel marriages.

      "body": "<p>Those jug ears were always going to be a problem. And then there was that alabaster countenance, with its delicately boned structure. Was he, many people asked at the time, a complete non-starter? Here, obviously, was someone who'd been at the midnight oil - a bit of a judicious browser and capable in his columnar authority of Proustian references. But was this really someone whom the nation wished to see palely loitering outside Downing Street, intent on broadcasting to its semi-comatose state late at night and early in the morning? In short: could Andrew Marr hack it as political editor of the BBC? </p> <p>The precedents were not good. There are endless examples of print journalists who tried to parachute into television and got shot. Adam Raphael had been a coolly rational political editor on The Observer before crashing and burning on Newsnight as he stared into the headlights of the incoming lens. Catastrophe veterans fondle with loving care the case notes on Sarah Hogg - formidable as The Independent's economics editor in its early days and later head of John Major's Policy Unit. But in between these dominatrix periods came enrolment in national service with Channel 4 News. Ghouls would tune in just to watch the broadcasting equivalent of a motorway pile-up. </p> <p>His immediate predecessors, admittedly, had made a successful transition from the word to the image. But they could not have been more different from him. Robin Oakley cut his teeth at the Express and the Mail, a man at ease inside his own blazer as he travelled in to work from Surrey. But Surrey is not part of Marr's mental geography, and the imputed prejudices of Middle England, from Clause 28 to asylum seekers, have felt his lash. It is, moreover, happily impossible to imagine him wearing a blazer. John Cole, on the other hand, shares with Marr a northern Celticity. But the extravagant Ulster vowels of the one are far removed from the other's faintly Scottish tones. Cole's cult status owed much to his abilities as a character actor starring in One Man And His Mike. But Marr shows no interest in being a caricatured \"personality\". Nor can he be. He is transparent - a cool northern light through which we see things clearly. </p> <p>For the truth about Marr - now six months into the job - is that he is not only good but a star. He may not be a broadcasting dish but that is the point. He shines for all the reasons that led many to be sceptical or cross about his appointment. He is 1997 man. The fact that before and after the New Labour victory he was \"the project\" in print led to some silly Tory squeals upon his appointment. If Will \"stake-holding\" Hutton had tried to give economic ballast to New Labour, Marr had lent it some cultural weight. His journalism recycled historical references to show that Britain was just an 18th-century invention. </p> <p>Unusual among journalists in refusing to accept the myth of Major's personal niceness, the sordid quality of 1992-7 touched a raw nerve in Marr's very moral fibre. But he was always keen - if only because he is naturally and intellectually curious - to discover a better kind of Tory beast. This, admittedly, was a difficult animal to track down - but, once sighted, his insider sources at Kenneth Clarke's Treasury allowed him to strip the Major sham with unusual authority. Now, perhaps stung by accusations that he is Tony Blair's glove puppet and is just one more lefty Scottish public-school boy (the Loretto lad to Blair's Fettes), he treads cautiously. Admirers may wonder why he feels the need to write a weekly \"note-book\" for the Daily Telegraph. And even Tory Marr sceptics will wonder at the industry which led him last week to attend a John Redwood book launch and loiter among the dispossessed. Marr has to be even-handed, but the objectivity which is broadcasting's elusive grail has not disabled him. </p> <p>Political journalists have to be political themselves. And career is often the mother of inventiveness. Marr has moved on rather from the agit-prop world of the Cambridge Students Union circa 1980. It was a time when Ed Stourton, now a broadcaster on Today, trod the boards of the more august Cambridge Union. Beleaguered Keith Vaz has recalled with misty eyes the \"sexiness\" of Stourton's performance as a French speaker in showy Union debates.

      "bodyText": "Those jug ears were always going to be a problem. And then there was that alabaster countenance, with its delicately boned structure. Was he, many people asked at the time, a complete non-starter? Here, obviously, was someone who'd been at the midnight oil - a bit of a judicious browser and capable in his columnar authority of Proustian references. But was this really someone whom the nation wished to see palely loitering outside Downing Street, intent on broadcasting to its semi-comatose state late at night and early in the morning? In short: could Andrew Marr hack it as political editor of the BBC? The precedents were not good. There are endless examples of print journalists who tried to parachute into television and got shot. Adam Raphael had been a coolly rational political editor on The Observer before crashing and burning on Newsnight as he stared into the headlights of the incoming lens. Catastrophe veterans fondle with loving care the case notes on Sarah Hogg - formidable as The Independent's economics editor in its early days and later head of John Major's Policy Unit. But in between these dominatrix periods came enrolment in national service with Channel 4 News. Ghouls would tune in just to watch the broadcasting equivalent of a motorway pile-up. His immediate predecessors, admittedly, had made a successful transition from the word to the image. But they could not have been more different from him. Robin Oakley cut his teeth at the Express and the Mail, a man at ease inside his own blazer as he travelled in to work from Surrey. But Surrey is not part of Marr's mental geography, and the imputed prejudices of Middle England, from Clause 28 to asylum seekers, have felt his lash. It is, moreover, happily impossible to imagine him wearing a blazer. John Cole, on the other hand, shares with Marr a northern Celticity. But the extravagant Ulster vowels of the one are far removed from the other's faintly Scottish tones. Cole's cult status owed much to his abilities as a character actor starring in One Man And His Mike. But Marr shows no interest in being a caricatured \"personality\". Nor can he be. He is transparent - a cool northern light through which we see things clearly. For the truth about Marr - now six months into the job - is that he is not only good but a star. He may not be a broadcasting dish but that is the point. He shines for all the reasons that led many to be sceptical or cross about his appointment. He is 1997 man. The fact that before and after the New Labour victory he was \"the project\" in print led to some silly Tory squeals upon his appointment. If Will \"stake-holding\" Hutton had tried to give economic ballast to New Labour, Marr had lent it some cultural weight. His journalism recycled historical references to show that Britain was just an 18th-century invention. Unusual among journalists in refusing to accept the myth of Major's personal niceness, the sordid quality of 1992-7 touched a raw nerve in Marr's very moral fibre. But he was always keen - if only because he is naturally and intellectually curious - to discover a better kind of Tory beast. This, admittedly, was a difficult animal to track down - but, once sighted, his insider sources at Kenneth Clarke's Treasury allowed him to strip the Major sham with unusual authority. Now, perhaps stung by accusations that he is Tony Blair's glove puppet and is just one more lefty Scottish public-school boy (the Loretto lad to Blair's Fettes), he treads cautiously. Admirers may wonder why he feels the need to write a weekly \"note-book\" for the Daily Telegraph. And even Tory Marr sceptics will wonder at the industry which led him last week to attend a John Redwood book launch and loiter among the dispossessed. Marr has to be even-handed, but the objectivity which is broadcasting's elusive grail has not disabled him. Political journalists have to be political themselves. And career is often the mother of inventiveness. Marr has moved on rather from the agit-prop world of the Cambridge Students Union circa 1980. It was a time when Ed Stourton, now a broadcaster on Today, trod the boards of the more august Cambridge Union. Beleaguered Keith Vaz has recalled with misty eyes the \"sexiness\" of Stourton's performance as a French speaker in showy Union debates. But the CSU was something different - full of coffee-mug stains and anger at early Thatcher. As mellifluous Stourton pays the price for having an Etonian son and is relegated from democratic Today to patrician yesterday, the question arises: Who's the sexy one now? Broadcasting - and in particular television - is full of very grand personalities. Between all that make-up and the congenital scruffiness of print journalists the gap yawns. Sometimes there is a Frost-like crawling to power. Sometimes there's Paxonian inquisition. But in both cases there's an ego in flight. And the drama flatters the interrogated politician. Look!

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Anthony Hopkins is suffering from jet lag. From the neck downwards, he is dapper, ship-shape, not a thread out of place - the dark suit, ribbed high-neck sweater and polished long-toed shoes are flawless. But his face is grey; those famous piercing blue eyes are pale and hooded, and from time to time he fails to stifle a yawn. The Hannibal publicity tour is taking its toll. </p> <p>Last week it was New York and Rome, then Paris and London. Yesterday he left for Berlin, then it's on to Madrid, Boston, Los Angeles and Mexico. Then back to Los Angeles, then Japan. \"Oh God!\" He covers his face with his large, meaty yellow hands in mock horror. </p> <p>As Hopkins embarks on the London round of interviews and photocalls, the figures come through for Hannibal's opening in the US and the producers are over the moon. \"To me it's all hieroglyphics,\" says Hopkins wearily. Right now he seems all of his 63 years. \"I don't know quite what they're talking about, numbers and all that. It's not that I pretend I don't know, I honestly don't know. But I'm very pleased for them, they all seem to be thrilled.\" </p> <p>It's not until you meet Hopkins that you appreciate the scale of his success. The machinery surrounding him is enormous. We still think of him as the misfit son of a baker from Port Talbot, who used to swallow Indian ink as a party trick, then discovered an unlikely talent for acting as well as a liking for the bottle. But he's well beyond our reach now. Last year he became an American citizen; today he is one of the biggest film stars on the planet. When he comes to town, his entourage takes over much of the second floor of London's Dorchester hotel. It's a slick, professional operation - journalists are escorted from one room to the next, gradually getting closer to the man himself, then you meet him, and before you know it, it's over. It's like meeting the Dalai Lama, or Princess Di, or Michael Jackson. Hopkins, I think, would hate the comparison. </p> <p>It is a decade since Hopkins was catapulted to superstardom by his Oscar-winning performance as the murderous Dr Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs. \"I expected Silence of the Lambs to be a big hit; but I wasn't sure about Hannibal because it's a sequel. I was waiting for the critics to gun us down,\" he says. His voice is beautiful, mellifluous; when he talks it's like being dusted with deeply perfumed talcum powder. </p> <p>Apart from a funky orange watch on his left wrist, Hopkins today is a picture of sobriety. The drinking may have stopped 25 years ago (he reportedly still attends AA meetings), but his life has always been rocked by an inner turbulence which has left its fair share of casualties. He left his first wife and young daughter, whom he didn't see for many years; he now lives separately from his second wife who remains in London while he is in LA; and earlier this year he was reported to have split up from a girlfriend. David Hare once said: \"Tony is permanently in the grip of feelings he cannot control.\" </p> <p>He looks more in control now than he ever has, but not long before filming Hannibal, Hopkins clearly went through some sort of life crisis. It was reported at the time that he was planning to retire but he says that wasn't true. He had had a difficult time working on Julie Taymor's Titus and made a flippant remark to a fellow actor on set, which found its way into the press. (Those \"arbiters of the truth\", he says sarcastically. He doesn't like the British tabloid papers very much). Still, he was sufficiently worried about his health to stop work and get himself checked out. </p> <p>\"I did take a year off. Just to have a rest really, to get myself into good shape. I had been working too hard and I thought it would be good to get a medical check up to make sure I was OK. I changed my diet. I started a regimen of exercise - not fanatically, but walking and climbing mountains and that sort of thing. Then I came back to Lecter feeling refreshed, and rejuvenated and happier. And I abandoned my colossal ambition to do everything, because that's always a drive driven by fear. </p> <p>\"I'm losing the restlessness, which is good. I'd be quite happy now if nothing happened. I really would. I think I would. I wasn't bored in my year off.\" Seconds later he is telling me that in the course of that year he went to a place called Ojai in northern California where he bought a nice house; but after four months he got so bored he sold it back to the owner and returned to Los Angeles. Oh, and he squeezed in a small part in Mission Impossible II, filming in Australia with Tom Cruise. </p> <p>He's already done two films since Hannibal (Stephen King's Hearts in Atlantis and The Devil and Daniel Webster, directed by and starring Alec Baldwin); he's about to start on another, an action movie called Black Sheep, and he's hoping to do Prospero in The Tempest with Julie Taymor next year.

      "bodyText": "Anthony Hopkins is suffering from jet lag. From the neck downwards, he is dapper, ship-shape, not a thread out of place - the dark suit, ribbed high-neck sweater and polished long-toed shoes are flawless. But his face is grey; those famous piercing blue eyes are pale and hooded, and from time to time he fails to stifle a yawn. The Hannibal publicity tour is taking its toll. Last week it was New York and Rome, then Paris and London. Yesterday he left for Berlin, then it's on to Madrid, Boston, Los Angeles and Mexico. Then back to Los Angeles, then Japan. \"Oh God!\" He covers his face with his large, meaty yellow hands in mock horror. As Hopkins embarks on the London round of interviews and photocalls, the figures come through for Hannibal's opening in the US and the producers are over the moon. \"To me it's all hieroglyphics,\" says Hopkins wearily. Right now he seems all of his 63 years. \"I don't know quite what they're talking about, numbers and all that. It's not that I pretend I don't know, I honestly don't know. But I'm very pleased for them, they all seem to be thrilled.\" It's not until you meet Hopkins that you appreciate the scale of his success. The machinery surrounding him is enormous. We still think of him as the misfit son of a baker from Port Talbot, who used to swallow Indian ink as a party trick, then discovered an unlikely talent for acting as well as a liking for the bottle. But he's well beyond our reach now. Last year he became an American citizen; today he is one of the biggest film stars on the planet. When he comes to town, his entourage takes over much of the second floor of London's Dorchester hotel. It's a slick, professional operation - journalists are escorted from one room to the next, gradually getting closer to the man himself, then you meet him, and before you know it, it's over. It's like meeting the Dalai Lama, or Princess Di, or Michael Jackson. Hopkins, I think, would hate the comparison. It is a decade since Hopkins was catapulted to superstardom by his Oscar-winning performance as the murderous Dr Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs. \"I expected Silence of the Lambs to be a big hit; but I wasn't sure about Hannibal because it's a sequel. I was waiting for the critics to gun us down,\" he says. His voice is beautiful, mellifluous; when he talks it's like being dusted with deeply perfumed talcum powder. Apart from a funky orange watch on his left wrist, Hopkins today is a picture of sobriety. The drinking may have stopped 25 years ago (he reportedly still attends AA meetings), but his life has always been rocked by an inner turbulence which has left its fair share of casualties. He left his first wife and young daughter, whom he didn't see for many years; he now lives separately from his second wife who remains in London while he is in LA; and earlier this year he was reported to have split up from a girlfriend. David Hare once said: \"Tony is permanently in the grip of feelings he cannot control.\" He looks more in control now than he ever has, but not long before filming Hannibal, Hopkins clearly went through some sort of life crisis. It was reported at the time that he was planning to retire but he says that wasn't true. He had had a difficult time working on Julie Taymor's Titus and made a flippant remark to a fellow actor on set, which found its way into the press. (Those \"arbiters of the truth\", he says sarcastically. He doesn't like the British tabloid papers very much). Still, he was sufficiently worried about his health to stop work and get himself checked out. \"I did take a year off. Just to have a rest really, to get myself into good shape. I had been working too hard and I thought it would be good to get a medical check up to make sure I was OK. I changed my diet. I started a regimen of exercise - not fanatically, but walking and climbing mountains and that sort of thing. Then I came back to Lecter feeling refreshed, and rejuvenated and happier. And I abandoned my colossal ambition to do everything, because that's always a drive driven by fear. \"I'm losing the restlessness, which is good. I'd be quite happy now if nothing happened. I really would. I think I would. I wasn't bored in my year off.\" Seconds later he is telling me that in the course of that year he went to a place called Ojai in northern California where he bought a nice house; but after four months he got so bored he sold it back to the owner and returned to Los Angeles. Oh, and he squeezed in a small part in Mission Impossible II, filming in Australia with Tom Cruise. He's already done two films since Hannibal (Stephen King's Hearts in Atlantis and The Devil and Daniel Webster, directed by and starring Alec Baldwin); he's about to start on another, an action movie called Black Sheep, and he's hoping to do Prospero in The Tempest with Julie Taymor next year. He is also a gifted pianist and composer and is working on his music, and finally - well, it probably isn't finally - he's submitting his own idea for a sequel to Hannibal. Producer Dino De Laurentiis wants to follow up Hannibal with Red Dragon, Thomas Harris's 1981 novel which first introduced the character of Lecter and is set seven years before The Silence of the Lambs, but Hopkins has reservations. \"Recently, in the last few days, I've thought if anything's going to be done I'd rather do a sequel along the lines of a mythical battle between these two figures. She's now a hero warrior and I have an idea, a theme which I've written down, that he contacts her again and he sets baits for her, just little signs and they meet very briefly. He forces the meeting; is very gentle with her and lures her into a remote wilderness, a frightening, lonely place for the final battle.\" What does seem unlikely is the prospect of Hopkins following in the footsteps of Jessica Lange, Kevin Spacey and a host of other American film stars, who have temporarily abandoned the glitz of Hollywood in favour of a run in London's West End. \"Oh God,\" he exclaims, appalled. \"A wet Wednesday at the Old Vic!

When The Jazz Singer was remade in 1980, it starred Diamond as the singer whose choice of a secular career almost destroys his relationship with his cantor father. The movie hit an impressive triple whammy: it was a commercial, a creative, and a critical fiasco. As the film's producer, it was all Diamond's fault and he stood in the flight-path of most of the excrement flung at his labour of love. </p> <p>Moviegoers probably thought they'd seen the last of Diamond as a screen performer. Not so. He's back, this time as himself, in the new comedy Saving Sliverman, which was the only movie with the temerity to open opposite Ridley Scott's overblown Hannibal this weekend. </p> <p>Saving Silverman pitches itself halfway between the infantile Jerry Lewisisms of Adam Sandler and the more mean-spirited comedy of the Farrelly brothers. It has a great cast that it doesn't deserve, and though there's no shortage of laughs, the film has an ersatz, warmed-over feel. Plus it only has a PG-13 rating, so the potentially compensatory gross-out elements can only go so far. </p> <p>Darren Silverman (Jason Biggs) is the lead singer of Diamonds in the Rough, a Neil tribute band that also includes his witless friends Wayne (Steve Zahn) and JD McNugent (Jack Black). Silverman hooks up with Amanda Peet's nightmare dream-girl Alison, whom JD initially describes as \"the Queen of All Honeys\" before he and Wayne realise that in fact she is, \"Freddy Kreuger, dude, but with like, way better tits\". Wayne and JD are the quintessential useless sidekick duo, insane with butthead ambitions for Neil-centric musical world-domination, and addicted to the nine-burgers-a-day diet of the classic American underachiever. </p> <p>So when Alison orders Silverman to dump his bandmates, they decide to kidnap her and set Darren up with his ex, who is a week away from becoming a nun. Mini-skirted novitiates and castrating bitches: such are the movie's ideas about women. </p> <p>It's a shame, because this is an energetic cast whose previous work had me hoping that Saving Silverman might be a nifty little sleeper. Peet has been the best thing in several deeply average films: her topless assassin in The Whole Nine Yards is the only thing worth remembering from that movie. Behind her slightly unnerving cinemascope dental-work there's a gifted comedian, but one on the brink of five years of negative typecasting. </p> <p>Steve Zahn has worked a good line in stoner idiots and country-fried brain-donors in That Thing You Do and Out of Sight. And Jack Black made a huge splash in High Fidelity last year as one of John Cusack's taste-stalinist record-shop assistants. </p> <p>Along with star Jason Briggs - who left a suspiciously shaped aperture in the crust of American Pie - the cast promises what the script and direction can't deliver. It turns out that Neil Diamond's small cameo is one of the best in the movie, with a line he wrote himself: \"Love on the rocks? Ain't no surprise!\" </p> <p>And so to Hannibal, which I'm anxious not to bore you with, since the gusto that director Ridley Scott mustered for his energetic, if faintly ridiculous Gladiator seems to have deserted him, leaving Hannibal a curiously inert experience. Scott can create beautiful, coherent worlds on screen (Alien, Blade Runner), but usually fails to fill them with interesting characters, and Hannibal is a compendium of all his worst traits: cheesy aesthetics, flaccid storytelling.

      "body": "<p>Once upon a time people lounged on clouds a great deal. They always had drapery around their naughty bits. Often they chatted to each other and passed grapes across the void. Sometimes they sang Rolling Stones numbers. \"Hey!\" bawled one. \"Hey!\" replied the other. \"You!\" shouted the first. \"You!\" echoed the second. \"Get offa my cloud!\" they chorused. There were chubby cherubs, too, who flew around taking orders for grapes. </p> <p>Unfortunately, flying babies frighten me. And there are a great deal of them at the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Lille. They feature in an exhibition called Settecento: Tiepolo's Century, which consists of 122 Italian paintings from the 18th century drawn from French collections. It is a show of rococo art, with all the pinks, Prussian blues, clouds and crowds that word implies. This is an historical display, not simply of Italian art at a time when it was being eclipsed by French and Dutch competition, but of what French collectors of the time bought. </p> <p>Settecento has, then, the promise of more than a few mediocre paintings. This may explain why staff outnumbered me by at least five to one when I went around the exhibition. But I was entranced by most of what I saw. </p> <p>There are two main kinds of paintings here - horizontal and vertical. In the former, usually by Canaletto and often involving a view of a Venice building, the horizontal plane is exaggerated, and the effect is profoundly melancholy and inert. For instance, there are two depictions by Canaletto of Notre-Dame-de-la-Salute church in Venice. One is sunny, the other gloomy. But even the sunny view makes you feel extremely miserable - which, on a wet February day in Lille, is not what you need at all. </p> <p>One hurries on to Francesco Guardi's depictions of Venice, because they don't play this melancholy game. Their blue remembered skies and waters are more vivid than Canaletto's, their canal scenes more jaunty. Guardi dabs his Venice into being, like a proto-impressionist, but charges his paintings with powerful lines, like a vorticist. There's a particularly energetic Guardi painting called The Doge Carried Around St Mark's Square, with the lines of two terraces racing to converge on the cathedral at the centre of the canvas, and the Campanile thrusting upwards to the right. There's no melancholy here, just compositional verve and power. </p> <p>In the middle of Guardi's canvas, a rough old vignette is played out: the doge is there high on his throne, while his henchmen beat back the thronging plebs with big sticks. The Venetian authorities don't do that sort of thing any more. </p> <p>The doge is also the focus of the Guardi canvas laboriously entitled The Doge on Board Bucentaure Leaving for the Lido on Ascension Day. Everything converges on this small but extremely powerful Venetian - the sky swoops down, the coastline hems in the action, the boats on the water and assorted riff-raff on the quay all turn obligingly towards him. Even the boat's oars point at the right angle. One can't quite suppress two thoughts: what a ponce, and what a lot of fuss for a journey of a few miles across calm waters. </p> <p>As for the vertical paintings in this exhibition, they work like this. Heaven is up and the Earth is down. Earthlings crane their necks skywards in some trepidation, and the heavens are filled with winged humanoids, mostly naked. In Antonio Guardi's Emmaus's Supper, for example, Jesus looks up from his meal at a skyful of writhing cherubs. He has a doleful expression that says, \"Don't look now, but they're back again,\" while Emmaus and his friend, looking at Christ, raise their arms in disbelief. </p> <p>\"Jesus,\" they all but say. \"Always making with the funny stuff.\" </p> <p>In the Levitation of Thomas De Cori by Antonio Cavallucci, a monk suddenly rises, cassock a-flap, towards the cherubic heavens.

By contrast, Lo Spagnolo's Christ Fallen from the Cross is alone worth the exhibition's admission fee. A red-faced centurion reaches over Christ's body to untie him from the cross. Christ's robe is red and blood drips on to the cross. But it is Christ's face that grabs your attention. His mouth is open as he sucks in his last breaths.

      "bodyText": "Once upon a time people lounged on clouds a great deal. They always had drapery around their naughty bits. Often they chatted to each other and passed grapes across the void. Sometimes they sang Rolling Stones numbers. \"Hey!\" bawled one. \"Hey!\" replied the other. \"You!\" shouted the first. \"You!\" echoed the second. \"Get offa my cloud!\" they chorused. There were chubby cherubs, too, who flew around taking orders for grapes. Unfortunately, flying babies frighten me. And there are a great deal of them at the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Lille. They feature in an exhibition called Settecento: Tiepolo's Century, which consists of 122 Italian paintings from the 18th century drawn from French collections. It is a show of rococo art, with all the pinks, Prussian blues, clouds and crowds that word implies. This is an historical display, not simply of Italian art at a time when it was being eclipsed by French and Dutch competition, but of what French collectors of the time bought. Settecento has, then, the promise of more than a few mediocre paintings. This may explain why staff outnumbered me by at least five to one when I went around the exhibition. But I was entranced by most of what I saw. There are two main kinds of paintings here - horizontal and vertical. In the former, usually by Canaletto and often involving a view of a Venice building, the horizontal plane is exaggerated, and the effect is profoundly melancholy and inert. For instance, there are two depictions by Canaletto of Notre-Dame-de-la-Salute church in Venice. One is sunny, the other gloomy. But even the sunny view makes you feel extremely miserable - which, on a wet February day in Lille, is not what you need at all. One hurries on to Francesco Guardi's depictions of Venice, because they don't play this melancholy game. Their blue remembered skies and waters are more vivid than Canaletto's, their canal scenes more jaunty. Guardi dabs his Venice into being, like a proto-impressionist, but charges his paintings with powerful lines, like a vorticist. There's a particularly energetic Guardi painting called The Doge Carried Around St Mark's Square, with the lines of two terraces racing to converge on the cathedral at the centre of the canvas, and the Campanile thrusting upwards to the right. There's no melancholy here, just compositional verve and power. In the middle of Guardi's canvas, a rough old vignette is played out: the doge is there high on his throne, while his henchmen beat back the thronging plebs with big sticks. The Venetian authorities don't do that sort of thing any more. The doge is also the focus of the Guardi canvas laboriously entitled The Doge on Board Bucentaure Leaving for the Lido on Ascension Day. Everything converges on this small but extremely powerful Venetian - the sky swoops down, the coastline hems in the action, the boats on the water and assorted riff-raff on the quay all turn obligingly towards him. Even the boat's oars point at the right angle. One can't quite suppress two thoughts: what a ponce, and what a lot of fuss for a journey of a few miles across calm waters. As for the vertical paintings in this exhibition, they work like this. Heaven is up and the Earth is down. Earthlings crane their necks skywards in some trepidation, and the heavens are filled with winged humanoids, mostly naked. In Antonio Guardi's Emmaus's Supper, for example, Jesus looks up from his meal at a skyful of writhing cherubs. He has a doleful expression that says, \"Don't look now, but they're back again,\" while Emmaus and his friend, looking at Christ, raise their arms in disbelief. \"Jesus,\" they all but say. \"Always making with the funny stuff.\" In the Levitation of Thomas De Cori by Antonio Cavallucci, a monk suddenly rises, cassock a-flap, towards the cherubic heavens. The polite society below avert their eyes, apart from one who can't resist trying to catch a peek of what's up theholy man's skirt.

He soon came to the fore on the national scene with a flurry of high scoring, which included 100 for Bengal against Uttar Pradesh on his Ranji Trophy debut in 1946-47. In his first international series in 1951-52, he scored 140 against England at Bombay and 111 at Madras when India achieved their first ever Test Match victory.</p> <p>In his first overseas tour, to England in 1952, hopes that he would be a successor to Vijay Merchant and Mustaq Ali, who had delighted crowds in England six years earlier, were shattered during his first exposure to England's fast bowlers - to Freddie Trueman in particular. Roy's seven innings in that series contained five ducks - four in consecutive innings.</p> <p>The Bengali owed his continued selection to high scoring in domestic competition and, in the interest of regional balance, to the selectors' reluctance to omit the East Zone's only cricket hero. After a West Indies tour in 1953 came the Test series - against New Zealand in 1955 that guaranteed his place in the record books.</p> <p>But it began badly. In the opening match, he scored a further duck and was dropped from the team. It was at this point, too, that he had an eye test and began to wear glasses. He fought his way back into the team, scored 100 at Calcutta and then, in the fifth Test Match at Madras, came his triumph. Hesitant at first, he and Vinoo Mankad survived the first day and progressed cautiously into the second. The two passed the then record Test Match first-wicket partnership of 359, set by Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook of England against South Africa in 1948/49 in Johannesburg. Then, on receiving a note from his captain, Polly Umrigar, to increase the scoring-rate, he was out after lunch for 173. The partnership stood at 413 runs.</p> <p>In spite of his reputed frailty against fast bowling, Roy defied West Indians Roy Gilchrist and Wesley Hall for 444 minutes to score a match-saving 90 at Bombay in 1958. Thereafter, the West Indies pace attack swept through the country, before they were halted again by Roy with 58 in a 93-runs stand with Dattu Gaekwad in the fifth Test match at Delhi.</p> <p>To Pankaj's disappointment, the aristocratic Gaekwad was appointed captain for the tour to England in 1959 with himself as vice-captain. Roy's performance there, though still disappointing, was better than it had been in 1952. He hit top-score in each innings (54 and 49) of the first Test match at Nottingham, and captained his country at Lord's.</p> <p>Wisden, which noted that his batting was vulnerable because of his stance and practice of playing off the back-foot, appreciated his captaincy quality: \"The side showed better form when he took over in Gaekwad's absence and his frequent consultation with other senior members of the side obviously helped in this improvement\". India, however, were outplayed and lost the series 5-0.</p> <p>Roy was dropped again after the first Test match against Pakistan in 1960, and, surprisingly, was never recalled. He served later on the national selection committee, and was proud that both his son, Pranab, and nephew, Ambar, played for India.

      "body": "<p>Perfumes and make-up clutter a shelf, a cheerful red and yellow duvet covers the bed and Titanic and Wu Tang Clan posters hide the stains on the wall. Layla Almualla's room could belong to any young university fresher but for one incongruous photograph: a shot of the squaddies from 27 Transport Regiment on exercise in Cyprus. Amid the mass of camouflage-clad masculinity, it is just possible to pick out Almualla in her battle dress.</p> <p>If the army wants to argue that it is no longer a bastion of beer-soaked yobs, Almualla could be its model 21st-century soldier. A former secretary and self-confessed \"girlie girl\", the 20-year-old is not only an experienced and professional soldier with a stint in Kosovo under her belt; she is also female, mixed race and living evidence that the force is finally changing.</p> <p>The British army has women in its sights. This is more than politically correct window dressing; it is genuinely keen to recruit women, for the simple reason that it has little choice. With a shortfall of 8,000 soldiers, the army has realised it must welcome those it once tended to shun: women, members of ethnic minorities and gay people. If it is true that a revolution is taking place in our armed forces, it is being driven less by demands for equal opportunities than by a desperate shortage of personnel.</p> <p>\"They are having recruitment problems because the traditional pool of white, working-class northern males has dried up - or doesn't want to join up,\" says Dr Rachel Woodward of the University of Newcastle, who is researching the armed forces' response to changing gender roles.</p> <p>Happily for the force, applications from women are surging. They make up 8% of the total armed forces, but 13% of new recruits. When women were first admitted they were strictly segregated, but in 1992 the Women's Royal Army Corps was disbanded, and 70% of the force is now fully gender-mixed. Even the combat units may succumb; a wide-ranging study into combat effectiveness and gender is due this year.</p> <p>\"The army is at an absolutely crucial point,\" says Woodward. \"It's a huge institution built on many years of pretty strong ideas about gendered identities, but all that is being challenged.\"</p> <p>Steering a 32,000 litre fuel tanker around the regimental base at Aldermaston, Almualla says that male colleagues soon get used to working with - and being outdone by - women. Perhaps inevitably, however, inclusion remains very much on male terms. Overtly feminine servicewomen, she says, are dismissed as \"combat Barbies\", and in order to fit in, women tend to act like one of the boys.</p> <p>\"We work and live so closely with them it's second nature,\" says Lance Corporal Diana Ryder, a colleague and friend of Almualla.</p> <p>These women are fortunate, all the same, to work in one of the more enlightened areas of the vast army machine. Women are so well integrated into the Transport Regiment that even the accommodation blocks are mixed sex. \"They don't bat an eyelid if you walk down the corridor in a towel from the shower,\" says Ryder.</p> <p>But the army is beginning to recognise that persuading women to apply for the job is not, in itself, enough. Faced with a significant retention problem, the force is taking a hard look at working conditions in an attempt to hang on to them. It is improving accommodation, trying to support soldiers better, and modernising many of the archaic and idiosyncratic regulations that staff find irksome. For instance, the ban on unmarried couples sharing soldiers' quarters is likely to be lifted, the MoD admitted last month.</p> <p>Even single mothers have their place. \"My friend's got pregnant and she's staying in,\" says Ryder. \"Her mates couldn't believe it - but this way her baby will always have security, a house, food on the table. Her pay goes up a bit. What's the alternative? Move back to Rotherham and get a council flat in a run down area?\"</p> <p>Second Lieutenant Mitch Wollaston of the Royal Engineers says she has few anxieties about commanding men when she finishes training. \"You can tell a bloke to get an effing move on and he won't hold it against you like a woman might,\" she says. She believes that despite their macho image, soldiers are so used to accepting orders that they will obey a woman with far less reluctance than many civilian men.</p> <p>But while there are certainly reasons to be cheerful, the army still has a long way to go. Harassment and discrimination still exist, and for those ambitious to move to the very top, female role models remain scarce. There are no female generals yet and virtually no brigadiers.</p> <p>And while some regiments have adopted an enlightened approach to women's recruitment, there are others that remain stubborn bastions of testosterone-charged intransigence. The different regiments that make up the army have highly distinctive identities which are often jealously guarded. Combat units, in particular, ban female recruits - and they ultimately form the core of the service.</p> <p>\"Combat effectiveness is not about cuddling babies and delivering tea,\" observed General Sir Charles Guthrie, chief of the defence staff, in a recent speech indicating his opposition to letting women fight. \"We must ensure that nothing, I repeat, nothing, damages the effectiveness of the British armed forces.\"</p> <p>The argument is not about whether women should serve on the frontline (they already do - Royal Engineers often precede the infantry) but whether they should be there to fight. Few women, goes the argument, have the physical strength required for a combat unit - although Germany, which opened up all its regiments to women last month, has taken on 224 female recruits in combat divisions.</p> <p>Yet it seems to be tacitly accepted that it is only a matter of time before a legal challenge under European law or the Human Rights Act ushers the admission of women through all ranks. Army top brass are publicly discussing preparations for their inclusion, as much to give the troops time to get used to the idea as because of an immediate need to do so.</p> <p>Woodward is exasperated by claims that the inclusion of women and introduction of a more female-friendly environment will ruin the army's fighting capabilities. \"There's this argument that we will have chaos and it will become all pink and fluffy,\" she says. \"It's incredibly reactionary; no one can suggest that tolerance automatically leads to chaos.\"</p> <p><b>'Killing is what we do' Private Noa Berman, one of the first Israeli women to serve in combat, is described by her fellow soldiers as a 'natural warrior'. </b> <br> <b> Ewen MacAskill </b></p> <p>Private Noa Berman stands on a lonely outpost on the Golan Heights, Israel's key strategic defensive position in the north of the country. The enemy, Syria, is visible across the flat scrubland. She knows that a Syrian observer probably has his binoculars trained on her, one of the few women combat soldiers in the world.</p> <p>Berman is one of only three women soldiers among 70 men at the base. She joined up in August, training for four months before arriving at the artillery battalion in December.</p> <p>Berman is 19 and has dreamed of becoming a combat soldier since childhood. \"I saw movies about war. There were no women and I wanted to be first to be there. I liked GI Jane when I was 16,\" she says, referring to the film starring Demi Moore as the first woman to join an elite US military unit.</p> <p>Israel is far ahead of Britain - and most other countries - in allowing women to serve in frontline units. It is also just about the only country where women are likely to see active combat.</p> <p>National service is compulsory for everyone in Israel, male and female. But until recently, women have been given jobs well back from the frontline: some working in areas like intelligence, but many others filling in time as secretaries.</p> <p>Private Berman did not want a soft life behind the lines. Instead, according to Israeli Defence Force terminology, she is a \"combat soldier\", expected to go out on patrol with the men. Her unit could be swapping shells with enemy artillery at any time and even hand-to-hand fighting is possible, should the base be attacked.

      "bodyText": "Perfumes and make-up clutter a shelf, a cheerful red and yellow duvet covers the bed and Titanic and Wu Tang Clan posters hide the stains on the wall. Layla Almualla's room could belong to any young university fresher but for one incongruous photograph: a shot of the squaddies from 27 Transport Regiment on exercise in Cyprus. Amid the mass of camouflage-clad masculinity, it is just possible to pick out Almualla in her battle dress. If the army wants to argue that it is no longer a bastion of beer-soaked yobs, Almualla could be its model 21st-century soldier. A former secretary and self-confessed \"girlie girl\", the 20-year-old is not only an experienced and professional soldier with a stint in Kosovo under her belt; she is also female, mixed race and living evidence that the force is finally changing. The British army has women in its sights. This is more than politically correct window dressing; it is genuinely keen to recruit women, for the simple reason that it has little choice. With a shortfall of 8,000 soldiers, the army has realised it must welcome those it once tended to shun: women, members of ethnic minorities and gay people. If it is true that a revolution is taking place in our armed forces, it is being driven less by demands for equal opportunities than by a desperate shortage of personnel. \"They are having recruitment problems because the traditional pool of white, working-class northern males has dried up - or doesn't want to join up,\" says Dr Rachel Woodward of the University of Newcastle, who is researching the armed forces' response to changing gender roles. Happily for the force, applications from women are surging. They make up 8% of the total armed forces, but 13% of new recruits. When women were first admitted they were strictly segregated, but in 1992 the Women's Royal Army Corps was disbanded, and 70% of the force is now fully gender-mixed. Even the combat units may succumb; a wide-ranging study into combat effectiveness and gender is due this year. \"The army is at an absolutely crucial point,\" says Woodward. \"It's a huge institution built on many years of pretty strong ideas about gendered identities, but all that is being challenged.\" Steering a 32,000 litre fuel tanker around the regimental base at Aldermaston, Almualla says that male colleagues soon get used to working with - and being outdone by - women. Perhaps inevitably, however, inclusion remains very much on male terms. Overtly feminine servicewomen, she says, are dismissed as \"combat Barbies\", and in order to fit in, women tend to act like one of the boys. \"We work and live so closely with them it's second nature,\" says Lance Corporal Diana Ryder, a colleague and friend of Almualla. These women are fortunate, all the same, to work in one of the more enlightened areas of the vast army machine. Women are so well integrated into the Transport Regiment that even the accommodation blocks are mixed sex. \"They don't bat an eyelid if you walk down the corridor in a towel from the shower,\" says Ryder. But the army is beginning to recognise that persuading women to apply for the job is not, in itself, enough. Faced with a significant retention problem, the force is taking a hard look at working conditions in an attempt to hang on to them. It is improving accommodation, trying to support soldiers better, and modernising many of the archaic and idiosyncratic regulations that staff find irksome. For instance, the ban on unmarried couples sharing soldiers' quarters is likely to be lifted, the MoD admitted last month. Even single mothers have their place. \"My friend's got pregnant and she's staying in,\" says Ryder. \"Her mates couldn't believe it - but this way her baby will always have security, a house, food on the table. Her pay goes up a bit. What's the alternative? Move back to Rotherham and get a council flat in a run down area?\" Second Lieutenant Mitch Wollaston of the Royal Engineers says she has few anxieties about commanding men when she finishes training. \"You can tell a bloke to get an effing move on and he won't hold it against you like a woman might,\" she says. She believes that despite their macho image, soldiers are so used to accepting orders that they will obey a woman with far less reluctance than many civilian men. But while there are certainly reasons to be cheerful, the army still has a long way to go. Harassment and discrimination still exist, and for those ambitious to move to the very top, female role models remain scarce. There are no female generals yet and virtually no brigadiers. And while some regiments have adopted an enlightened approach to women's recruitment, there are others that remain stubborn bastions of testosterone-charged intransigence. The different regiments that make up the army have highly distinctive identities which are often jealously guarded. Combat units, in particular, ban female recruits - and they ultimately form the core of the service. \"Combat effectiveness is not about cuddling babies and delivering tea,\" observed General Sir Charles Guthrie, chief of the defence staff, in a recent speech indicating his opposition to letting women fight. \"We must ensure that nothing, I repeat, nothing, damages the effectiveness of the British armed forces.\" The argument is not about whether women should serve on the frontline (they already do - Royal Engineers often precede the infantry) but whether they should be there to fight. Few women, goes the argument, have the physical strength required for a combat unit - although Germany, which opened up all its regiments to women last month, has taken on 224 female recruits in combat divisions. Yet it seems to be tacitly accepted that it is only a matter of time before a legal challenge under European law or the Human Rights Act ushers the admission of women through all ranks. Army top brass are publicly discussing preparations for their inclusion, as much to give the troops time to get used to the idea as because of an immediate need to do so. Woodward is exasperated by claims that the inclusion of women and introduction of a more female-friendly environment will ruin the army's fighting capabilities. \"There's this argument that we will have chaos and it will become all pink and fluffy,\" she says. \"It's incredibly reactionary; no one can suggest that tolerance automatically leads to chaos.\" 'Killing is what we do' Private Noa Berman, one of the first Israeli women to serve in combat, is described by her fellow soldiers as a 'natural warrior'. Ewen MacAskill Private Noa Berman stands on a lonely outpost on the Golan Heights, Israel's key strategic defensive position in the north of the country. The enemy, Syria, is visible across the flat scrubland. She knows that a Syrian observer probably has his binoculars trained on her, one of the few women combat soldiers in the world. Berman is one of only three women soldiers among 70 men at the base. She joined up in August, training for four months before arriving at the artillery battalion in December. Berman is 19 and has dreamed of becoming a combat soldier since childhood. \"I saw movies about war. There were no women and I wanted to be first to be there. I liked GI Jane when I was 16,\" she says, referring to the film starring Demi Moore as the first woman to join an elite US military unit. Israel is far ahead of Britain - and most other countries - in allowing women to serve in frontline units. It is also just about the only country where women are likely to see active combat. National service is compulsory for everyone in Israel, male and female. But until recently, women have been given jobs well back from the frontline: some working in areas like intelligence, but many others filling in time as secretaries. Private Berman did not want a soft life behind the lines. Instead, according to Israeli Defence Force terminology, she is a \"combat soldier\", expected to go out on patrol with the men. Her unit could be swapping shells with enemy artillery at any time and even hand-to-hand fighting is possible, should the base be attacked. In May, during the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon, her battalion saw action against Hizbullah, the Islamic fundamentalist guerilla group. Berman carries her rifle with her all the time, either on her lap or slung over her back. \"I have thought about killing people. That is the purpose of the army. That is what we do. The people we kill are against us.\" Caressing the gunbutt, she says: \"At first it was weird and hard to have a gun.\" She is, says a fellow woman soldier, a \"natural warrior\". War is not a new experience for Berman. She was brought up in Kiryat Shmona, the most northerly town in Israel, close to the Lebanese border and frequently under bombardment from Katyusha rockets fired by Hizbullah. Both her mother and father, who had been a sergeant in the army, were supportive of her decision to go into a combat unit. She had a boyfriend before joining the army, but they have broken up. A factor in the split was that she spent so much time away from home, allowed back only one weekend in two. When she leaves the army, Berman wants to be a psychologist and have children. She talks about how she and her two female comrades dug out their dresses when they went home on leave. There was nothing then to identify them as soldiers, except for the bootmarks round their ankles. Private Alon Weinstein, 18, who joined the battalion only a week before Berman and her two female colleagues, is relaxing in the sun. How does he find working alongside female soldiers? \"I do not think it matters. The commander called us and told us that if there was any trouble with the women, the punishment will be severe. So no one will mess with them. We treat them as soldiers. She is fighting alongside me. She is protecting me and I am protecting her. We are soldiers.\"",

      "body": "<p>He spent one Christmas morning trying to steal crack cocaine from a dealer who pulled a gun on him. But that wasn't enough to get him out of the junkie's life. Nor was the time another dealer put a knife to his throat. Nor even when a 300lb fellow inmate strung out on PCP chased him around a Manhattan holding pen singing the theme from I Love Lucy. Not until July 1997, when Stephen Gaghan had been a drug user for more than a decade, did he finally realise that he would have to change his life or die. </p> <p>\"Over one long, five-day weekend, I had three separate heroin dealers get arrested,\" Gaghan recalls. \"My dealer, my backup dealer and my backup-backup dealer. I was left alone, and I hit that place, that total incomprehensible demoralisation. That was the end of it; up five days straight, locked in the bathroom, convinced there was nowhere else to go. I had to kill myself.\" </p> <p>You may have spotted Gaghan during the Golden Globe awards broadcast recently, grinning when he won the best screenplay award for Steven Soderbergh's Traffic, a drama set in the world of drug smugglers, dealers and users. Next, it's thought, he could be nominated for an Oscar. </p> <p>Gaghan, who is 35, thin, with a rough-edged look, says he has been clean for three and a half years. But when he won his Emmy in 1997 (as one of the writers for an episode of NYPD Blue), he was in the thick of heroin and cocaine addiction. Now it is time to come clean about his past, a slow spiral that started at a private school in Louisville, Kentucky. </p> <p>\"People were asking me where I got the characters and situations for Traffic, and I found myself starting to speak in code,\" he says. He would talk about research he had done in the drug culture, about unnamed acquaintances, but he never admitted that a lot of it came from his own life. </p> <p>\"Part of the recovery process is a commitment to truth, and I began to feel that I was not being truthful,\" he says. \"The shame of drug addiction is part of what makes it difficult for people to ask for help, and I felt that I was perpetuating that stigma. If there is a message to the movie, I guess it's that drugs should be a health care issue rather than a criminal issue.\" </p> <p>He started, as young people often do, with alcohol and marijuana. \"I remember, when I was writing Traffic, talking to top federal drug-enforcement officials and having them say they read it and found it very good and believable, except the scene where the girl describes her resum\u00e9,\" he says. In that scene a private-school student, arrested for drug possession, ticks off her academic and athletic achievements to a disbelieving social worker. </p> <p>\"They said to me, 'There is no way this girl could be achieving at the level you have her achieving at and be using cocaine,' \" Gaghan says. \"I didn't tell them that the resum\u00e9 was my resum\u00e9 exactly, at a time when I was drinking every day and smoking marijuana and taking cocaine.\" </p> <p>The point, he says, is that drug addiction can attack anyone, even a high-achieving private-school student from a solid middle-class family. Many of Gaghan's school friends experimented with drugs, but for most of them it was a brief affair. But for him, it became fascinating. </p> <p>\"It was always just a point of trying to take it a little bit further than everybody else,\" he says. \"You end up finding lower and lower companions. People fall out, and you end up with people who are right on the edge of criminals, people who can procure for you the various things you need.\" </p> <p>He was thrown out of school but eventually got into a small business college in Massachusetts. There he hooked up with some venture capitalists and started a catalogue company, Fallen Empire Inc, hoping to earn enough to support his writing career and to buy booze and drugs. </p> <p>One of his stories, The Year With No Winter, was published in the Iowa Review in 1990. But the business was a disaster. When he had lost everyone's money, he simply ran away to New York: \"I'd get in trouble in one place, so I'd flee to someplace else.\" </p> <p>Most of the time he was using drugs. He shifted steadily toward cocaine and eventually the sniffable heroin that became popular in the early 1990s. \"It was just the thing to do,\" he says. \"You'd walk around the East Village in your hipster boots, listening to grunge music and being the prototypes of heroin chic. It's so embarrassing.\" </p> <p>By this time he was an addict, but he didn't know it: \"I thought I was having this literary adventure, that I was really fine.\" There were seizures, bouts of incontinence, a steady descent into mental and physical squalor. The amazing thing, he says, is that beyond his drug friends he was able to keep it a secret. \"I worked very hard on the mask. The one thing that I couldn't disguise was that I was getting arrested all the time.\" </p> <p>There were 20 or 30 arrests, mostly on minor charges. And then he made a mistake. \"I used to buy drugs from these 14-year-old kids who ran their operation out of an apartment in Manhattan. I went over there one day in late 1992. I had maybe $4 worth of heroin in my pocket, and I wanted to buy a half-gram of cocaine.\" </p> <p>He bought the cocaine and left the building, but was arrested around the corner, caught in a police sting. This was no petty offence: this was heroin and cocaine. But Gaghan borrowed from friends, used all his savings and hired a good lawyer. He pleaded guilty to possession and was given a conditional discharge. Then he acted the way he always did when backed into a corner. He fled to Los Angeles. </p> <p>It was 1993, and the worst was yet to come. He worked for a while answering phones for a production company. Then he stalked off on his own, hoping to make it as a movie writer. \"I got 10,000 rejections,\" he says. He lived the west Hollywood life of a struggling writer, getting odd jobs, up all night, high or strung out. </p> <p>\"It starts out that you have a bunch of people around you, living the same drug life, and then people start to drop off,\" Gaghan says. \"They die. They go into rehab. They disappear. Until finally you're down to a real hardcore, the iron men. After a while they're gone, too. And it's just you, locked in the bathroom. I honestly believe I spent three of the last 10 years locked in the bathroom.\" </p> <p>There is a scene in Traffic in which Michael Douglas, playing the addict's father, breaks into the bathroom where she has locked herself. It had to be in the film, Gaghan says, because the bathroom was in his life. </p> <p>By the mid-1990s, he began to get work. He had jobs on various movie lots, wrote some television shows, even shared an Emmy. But he was a drug addict the whole time. \"I smoked crack in my office on the Universal lot, always with some heroin to even it out,\" he says. </p> <p>And then came the day, in July 1997, he hit the wall. A friend led him to therapists, substance-abuse programmes and what he hopes will be a whole new life. Gaghan declines to give the name of the person who saved his life: it is a writer and actor, he says, who deserves his anonymity. He met a woman in recovery named Michael McCraine, and now they have a 9-month-old son, Gardner. It's been 43 months, he says, since he found the way out of the drug life. </p> <p>\"I'm happy now. No one who saw me a few years ago could believe I would be here. I don't know if drug addiction is genetic. I don't even know if it's a disease.

The enemy, Syria, is visible across the flat scrubland. She knows that a Syrian observer probably has his binoculars trained on her, one of the few women combat soldiers in the world. Berman is one of only three women soldiers among 70 men at the base. She joined up in August, training for four months before arriving at the artillery battalion in December. Berman is 19 and has dreamed of becoming a combat soldier since childhood. \"I saw movies about war. There were no women and I wanted to be first to be there. I liked GI Jane when I was 16,\" she says, referring to the film starring Demi Moore as the first woman to join an elite US military unit.

But Tate could also be an exciting, hard-swinging player too, and his control of the horn in its upper register predated many of the technical advances in saxophone playing that were made by the modernists in hard bop and the avant garde.</p> <p>Tate came up in the 1930s when swing ruled popular music and instrumental stars were heroes whose reputations were not far behind those of singers. But the connection between the song and the sound of a saxophone, trumpet or clarinet was closer then. Bebop, with its intricate, cliffhanging melody lines and unpredictable resolutions had not yet arrived to launch a jazz sound very different to the shapely lyricism of vocalised instrumental methods that mimicked singing. Tate therefore learned from the examples of saxophonists Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young and Herschel Evans.

He worked with McCloud's Night Owls, the St Louis Merrymakers and a band led by Terrence Holder that was later to be taken over by the celebrated Andy Kirk.</p> <p>Tate worked briefly for Count Basie on Lester Young's temporary departure, but this early incarnation of the Basie band soon broke up for want of bookings. But Basie's chance came again when swing became a national craze around the mid 1930s, and in 1939 Tate got his big break when was invited to join the now successful Basie orchestra following the sudden death of tenorist Herschel Evans. The two had been old friends and Tate maintained later that he had dreamed Evans had died before he ever heard the news, and was sure that a call from Basie would come. For Basie's part, the bandleader said in his autobiography: \"Buddy was enough like Herschel, so he could take care of that business, but he also had his own thing, which meant we still had two different styles, tones, and everything.\" Tate stayed with Basie for nine years, until postwar economics forced changes in the line-up and the saxophonist decided to look for work that would keep him closer to New York. Tate played for bandleaders Lucky Millinder and Hot Lips Page, and in Basie singer Jimmy Rushing's Savoy band.

Food safety watchdogs say millions of passengers a year need assurance that crews are following proper hygiene rules. A legal loophole means that standards of food preparation and service on air and sea transport are not subject to the same checks as land-based eating places. Environmental health officials covering ports and airports believe some outbreaks go unreported because travellers may not be struck down until hours after their flight, while holidaymakers suffering diarrhoea or upset stomachs on cruises are often reluctant to pay for a visit to the ship's doctor. Officials who receive complaints have no right of entry to check whether airlines or ship owners are observing safety rules. Peter Rotheram, of the association of port health authorities, said: \"It is very difficult to find out how big the problem is. Some of the airlines are quite cooperative, some are not. Officials monitor preparation of food before it is taken \"airside\" to aircraft but after that airlines can decide whether to allow on-board checks. Meals are sometimes transported for hours in aircraft holds, cooling as the plane cruises at high altitudes and warming as it lands, before being switched to galleys and prepared for passengers. The public health laboratory service recently suggested that 9% of water samples taken from drinking fountains and taps in airports and on aircraft might be contaminated. US officials regularly publish the results of hygiene checks on cruise ships, and these are believed to influence bookings. The food standards agency plans to consult on changes. It suggests that these would \"meet consumers' expectations that food hygiene standards can be enforced in all food businesses\".

More than 50 protesters broke into Eli Lilly &amp; Co in Basingstoke, Hampshire, and demonstrated outside the company's research centre in Windlesham, Surrey, and Novartis Pharmaceuticals in Camberley, Surrey.

      "body": "<p>Last year the Almeida revived Sartre's Les Main Sales (1948) under the title of The Novice. Now Erica Whyman starts her tenancy at the Gate with a rare sighting of Camus's Les Justes (1949), in a new translation by Gillian Hanna. Both plays deal with the ethics of political murder; but it is Camus, to my surprise, who treats it in a more complex and gripping manner. </p> <p>He starts with the advantage of historical truth. \"All my characters,\" he wrote, \"really existed and behaved in the way I describe.\" His subject is the plan by a group of Russian revolutionary socialists to assassinate the Tsar's uncle, Grand Duke Serge, in 1905. The initial failure of the poet, Kaliayev, to hurl the bomb, because of the children in the Grand Duke's carriage, prompts a fierce debate among the conspirators with the hardline Stepan arguing that violence should have no limits. But Kaliayev's eventual success leads to his imprisonment and exposure to the temptations of betraying his comrades and succumbing to Christian forgiveness at the hands of the Grand Duchess. </p> <p>Camus and Sartre quarrelled in the early 1950s and you can see why.

      "bodyText": "Last year the Almeida revived Sartre's Les Main Sales (1948) under the title of The Novice. Now Erica Whyman starts her tenancy at the Gate with a rare sighting of Camus's Les Justes (1949), in a new translation by Gillian Hanna. Both plays deal with the ethics of political murder; but it is Camus, to my surprise, who treats it in a more complex and gripping manner. He starts with the advantage of historical truth. \"All my characters,\" he wrote, \"really existed and behaved in the way I describe.\" His subject is the plan by a group of Russian revolutionary socialists to assassinate the Tsar's uncle, Grand Duke Serge, in 1905. The initial failure of the poet, Kaliayev, to hurl the bomb, because of the children in the Grand Duke's carriage, prompts a fierce debate among the conspirators with the hardline Stepan arguing that violence should have no limits. But Kaliayev's eventual success leads to his imprisonment and exposure to the temptations of betraying his comrades and succumbing to Christian forgiveness at the hands of the Grand Duchess. Camus and Sartre quarrelled in the early 1950s and you can see why. Sartre argued that in the cause of revolution, one must be willing to get one's hands dirty; Camus warns against the sacrifice of moral principles in the attack on absolutism. But Camus's strength is that he dramatises the argument in clear human terms. It is a classic revolutionary antithesis that haunts drama from Julius Caesar to Danton's Death, and it is one that Camus explores with genuine dialectical urgency. Given the emphasis on historical truth - the bereaved Grand Duchess really did visit the assassin in his cell - one wishes Camus supplied even more detail: he never makes it clear that the Grand Duke was notorious for his brutality towards dissent. And the conflict between passion and politics leads to some oddly mixed metaphors, as when Dora, who worships Kaliayev, tells him \"Love is a yoke, Jankek, however sweet.\" But as a study in the morality of political murder the play recalls the dark power of Dostoevsky's The Possessed, which Camus adapted for the stage in 1959.

As resident artist at the town's Paradise Mill (which was operational until 1981), Ben Cook has drawn upon this heritage to develop his project of Found Paintings. Taking flawed textiles, he stretches them across a wooden frame to give the appearance of a painted canvas in an approach that is somewhere between ready-made and revisionist. And now he's gone a step further, or rather, back. </p> <p>After selecting early hand-painted designs from the mill's textile design archive, Cook scanned them into a computer, played with them, and had them digitally printed on silk, and mounted on 6ft by 4ft wooden frames. It's an ingenious concept, for in taking the process back to its source and then bringing in computer-aided design, Cook is utilising design skills that are more than 100 years apart. The results are stunning. </p> <p>Taking as its reference point the coloured line-blocks of the famous Macclesfield Stripe design, Cook's Study for A Macclesfield Stripe immediately challenges the barcode-like formality of the original. From a distance, the silk looks like a vivid canvas, and Cook's softened lines seem like a sketch of shimmering blinds, or diffracted rays, blurring from the centre outwards. Strikingly, the print achieves a three-dimensional effect as the lines reach towards the viewer to create the illusion of a step. </p> <p>Such is the allure of these strange slats of colour that they seem to hail and hold the viewer. Painting the Void is no exception. The starting point here is an old block design of thin red, black and blue lines crossing in a kind of intense circuit diagram. Cook has exploded this into a print with a searing, cinematic feel. Like a photograph of a speeding object, the edges are wildly out-of-focus, a concrete spin with mere traces of colour. Staring at the more defined white-blue-pink lines at the centre, you feel like you're playing a computer game in which you steer a hapless vessel between ever-narrowing walls, as Cook traps the viewer in a landscape of frantic motion and space. An ideal pattern, then, for a 21st-century silk scarf or tie. </p> <p>\u0095 Until February 18. Details: 01625 619831.</p>",

Taking as its reference point the coloured line-blocks of the famous Macclesfield Stripe design, Cook's Study for A Macclesfield Stripe immediately challenges the barcode-like formality of the original. From a distance, the silk looks like a vivid canvas, and Cook's softened lines seem like a sketch of shimmering blinds, or diffracted rays, blurring from the centre outwards. Strikingly, the print achieves a three-dimensional effect as the lines reach towards the viewer to create the illusion of a step. Such is the allure of these strange slats of colour that they seem to hail and hold the viewer. Painting the Void is no exception. The starting point here is an old block design of thin red, black and blue lines crossing in a kind of intense circuit diagram. Cook has exploded this into a print with a searing, cinematic feel. Like a photograph of a speeding object, the edges are wildly out-of-focus, a concrete spin with mere traces of colour. Staring at the more defined white-blue-pink lines at the centre, you feel like you're playing a computer game in which you steer a hapless vessel between ever-narrowing walls, as Cook traps the viewer in a landscape of frantic motion and space. An ideal pattern, then, for a 21st-century silk scarf or tie. \u0095 Until February 18. Details: 01625 619831.",

That was the backdrop to this visit with the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, with a programme devoted to Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington. It was always going to be one of the box-office draws of the jazz year, and one of its exasperating conundrums. </p> <p>As always, the stagey informality of the banter between the players sounded as if its intention was to massage hip-jazzbo stereotypes in the expectations of an upmarket mainstream audience, rather than reveal the truly wayward spontaneous impulses among the players that brought jazz into being in the first place. </p> <p>But the music certainly represented what Marsalis always protests is his intention - to recast the early music with a contemporary spin. The first part of the programme was devoted to Louis Armstrong's early work, and the orchestra adopted a policy with this almost eight-decade-old music of shifting between the two-beat chug-chug of an early swing rhythm and a more contemporary feel. The soloists correspondingly operated in a crossover territory between the raw, blues-rooted directness of the old improvising styles, and a more complex and intricate post-John Coltrane, post-Miles Davis manner. </p> <p>Marsalis himself delivered some masterly instances of this. At the close of Tight Like This, with the orchestra recapping the tune in its authentic tempo, the trumpeter repeated a single note instead of the theme, but kept varying its duration and placement with the deceptive effect that the repeating undertow seemed to be constantly changing shape. Mahagony Hall Stomp was peppered with the kind of bebop sax solos still 15 years away when it was first conceived (tenorists Victor Goines and Walter Blanding Jnr swerved divertingly into Lady Be Good during their duet variations on it), and Marcus Printup confirmed that Marsalis wasn't the only trumpeter who could combine the bravura 1920s manner and postbop's capricious melodies without losing the plot. </p> <p>An uptempo train-rhythm swinger was one of the concert's few originals, and the musical and conceptual success of Marsalis's music for the 1994 Blood on the Fields oratorio (it remains a high point for him) was confirmed by the swaggering Mingus-like roar of Back to Basics, with its barging, colliding brass lines and wheeling, yelping sax melodies. Marsalis's solo of wah-wah effects, indignant, grimacing slurs, manic giggles, and deft, dancing runs was his solo of the night.

It doesn't have to be either-or, but there is a point to the saying. A Figaro that is equally sublime as music and as comedy is a blue moon event. </p> <p>There was no blue moon shining over Cardiff on the opening night of Welsh National Opera's new production of Figaro. As comedy it was excellent. You could hear people laughing all the way through - real laughter, not polite opera-house titters. The acting was lively, fresh, and on the whole well-staged. Nicola Ulivieri and Nuccia Focile made a genuinely likable Figaro and Susanna. Gidon Saks's Count Almaviva was outstanding - a great big testosterone-enriched baby, swinging between lecherous ecstasy and furious desire for vengeance, and finally repenting like a chastened three-year-old. </p> <p>All the characters sparked off each other continuously. The action was taut, never limp. Full marks for comedy then. But the music was more variable, even though good singing wasn't lacking. Saks's round, fruity bass-baritone and nicely over-the-top phrasing heightened his triumph as the Count. Focile's clear, bright Susanna always sounded secure and alive. Marcellina even emerged as a creature with some depth of feeling, thanks to Anne Mason's impassioned singing. </p> <p>Ulivieri's Figaro, however wasn't quite as charming to the ear as he was to the eye. And Geraldine McGreevy's Countess was a disappointment. She had her moments, but her two great numbers, Porgi amor and Dove sono, weren't among them. Conductor Rinaldo Alessandrini sounded as though he couldn't decide whether to set the tempo or follow McGreevy, with the result that the rhythmic glue sometimes came unstuck. Generally speaking, the Welsh National Orchestra played cleanly and enthusiastically for Alessandrini, but faltering voice-orchestra ensemble and unsteady tempo were recurring problems. </p> <p>Somehow though, spirit won out over technical imperfections - and over passing oddities in Neil Armfield's production, such as the Countess's 1960s industrial hair-drier in the corner of her baroque boudoir, and the first scenes of the first and third acts, which look as though they take place inside a half-unpacked IKEA furniture kit. In the end WNO's Figaro is a thoroughly enjoyable evening's theatre. And for those who still need to be convinced that classic opera can actually be alive and funny, this might just be a conversion experience. </p> <p>\u0095 In rep until March 2.

      "body": "<p>Can a cartoon mouse hole be art? Drawn on a piece of white card and propped at the foot of the wall, it would fool no gallery visitor, mouse or human. The mouse would pass it by without another thought. For some reason, some of us humans stop and wonder. </p> <p>The recurrent theme of art of the past 100 years has been: what is it? Innovative artists see how far they can push art towards non-art. Non-art, when placed in a gallery, is art with a bit of edge to it. How far before it goes over the edge and leaves us as indifferent as the mouse? Ceal Floyer is an artist worth noticing because she makes such well-worn questions seem once again intriguing and amusing. </p> <p>Floyer's consumer minimalism aims for meaningful irreverence rather than transcendence. The catalogue quotes a Ceal Floyer joke: \"A woman walks into a bar, goes up to the barman, and asks him for a double entendre. So he gives her one.\" Her visual jokes are on the gallery and on the visitor. It's hard to say where the art is. What little there is is obviously not what it seems. A light switch is a projection of a light switch. Light seeping under a door is also a projection. Floyer makes no effort to hide the projectors. Disbelief is stressed rather than suspended. The sound of water dripping into a bucket comes from a CD player in a bucket. The label reads Bucket, 1999, CD player, CD. Garbage Bag, 1996, is a black plastic bin bag filled with thin air. </p> <p>Many of these pieces have a room all to themselves. Floyer makes you see just how empty a virtually empty gallery can be. Maybe the gallery space, filled with the cultural unease brought to it by the half-amused visitor, becomes the artwork more than the artworks themselves. Here's Monochrome Till Receipt (White), 2001. It's what it says on the label. It doesn't take long before you notice that Floyer's purchases are all on a theme of white: Polo Mints, Salt, Single Cream, Lard, Dove Bar. Untitled (Twin Decks), 1999, is two record decks holding two revolving records. From two speakers comes the sound of two scratches, repeating with monotonous regularity. Is this minimalist enchantment? No. Is it silly bugger stuff? Not entirely. If it's not art what is it? Nothing. So it must be art, then. </p> <p>\u0095 Until March 25. Details: 0121-248 0708.</p>",
