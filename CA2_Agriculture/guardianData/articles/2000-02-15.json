Players have got to accept some direct responsibility. </p> <p>\"We are particularly saddened by the behaviour of certain players who ought to know better. Threatening to deduct points, unless there are specific charges made and proven, is not the answer.\" </p> <p>Lee said the PFA had an important part to play and called on managers to clearly spell out what is unacceptable. The PFA agrees, though it feels the weekend's unsavoury events will have had an instant effect. </p> <p>\"I don't think players want to see themselves behaving like that in the cold light of day,\" said Taylor's deputy Brendan Batson. \"Don't forget they've got families and mums and dads. They will think 'Christ, was that me?' </p> <p>\"But what's important is how they control themselves in the heat of competition. Certainly the responsibility is on the players. No one is looking to absolve them of that. But how you get that across to them rests solely with the clubs. </p> <p>\"Players at the top end are very bright in taking on board instructions from their manager. And in the same way that you practise all the time so things become instinctive, the manager has to be saying to all the players from the first team to the academy on a continual basis what their responsibilities are.\" </p> <p>Batson believes it would help to apply rugby's 10-yard rule as a penalty for dissent. That will be an idea discussed by the International Board, football's law-making body, at a meeting on Friday and Saturday. </p> <p>What seems clear is that a recent move advising referees to show more restraint in handing out red and yellow cards has made life more difficult for officials. </p> <p>Gerald Ashby, the Premier League referees' assessor, says players have exploited the leniency by stepping up the crude challenges and abuse. </p> <p>\"You only have to look at the mass dissent shown by the Manchester United players in recent games towards Andy d'Urso and Steve Lodge,\" he said. \"I am not picking on Manchester United - there have been plenty of other examples of similar things I have seen from other sides - but is that the image of football we want to portray? </p> <p>\"Then, using just one example, some of the challenges I saw on television in the Leeds-Tottenham game at the weekend were appalling. People will get badly injured by some of the tackles I have seen creep back into the game since the refs were told to ease up on the cards.\" </p> <p>Incessant references to United's behaviour have angered Sir Alex Ferguson, who believes his players are being victimised \"when the whole country is the same\". </p> <p>But he admitted it was time for his squad to learn: \"Our players are going to have to be perfect in their behaviour to keep the hounds at bay because one blemish and we are slaughtered.\" </p> <p>Many would argue that as role models they have a responsibility in any case. \"What is seen on a Saturday and Sunday is certainly reflected during the week in some of our schools football,\" said Malcolm Berry, the chief executive of the English Schools FA. \"It's prevalent in schools football when it didn't used to be and it's definitely proving to be difficult for us.\"</p>",

The former Arsenal and England striker has moved from Parkhead on a free transfer after Kenny Dalglish told him he could not be guaranteed first-team football. </p> <p>Wright was signed for Celtic by the former head coach John Barnes as a replacement for Henrik Larsson but, after scoring on his debut in a 5-1 win over Kilmarnock, managed only two further goals. The 36-year-old insists he will retire at the end of the season.</p> <p>Wright is still facing disciplinary action from the Scottish Football Association after he was sent off at Kilmarnock last month following a post-match confrontation with the fourth official. The SFA confirmed last night that any suspension he receives will apply at Burnley.</p> <p>His push on the official and a subsequent unrepentant attitude in a newspaper column could lead to a heavy fine and a lengthy ban.</p> <p>\"Part of his clearance certificate to join Burnley will be that any outstanding disciplinary action will remain against him,\" said an SFA spokesman. \"He may still be required to attend a hearing and, if he has to serve any suspension, the Scottish FA will notify the English FA accordingly. Normal practice is that any ban will still apply.</p> <p>\"There have been several cases like this before, the most high-profile being Duncan Ferguson. It happens from time to time that players move and, if they do so, they take any suspensions with them.\"</p> <p>Wright will almost certainly go straight into the starting line-up for Burnley's match against their fellow promotion hopefuls Wigan at Turf Moor on Saturday as the Clarets' striker Andy Payton begins a three-match suspension.</p> <p>Jonathan Gould has also decided to leave Parkhead after losing his place as the first-choice goalkeeper to Dmitri Kharine but Celtic have turned down an offer from West Ham to take the Scottish international on loan.

      "bodyText": "Ian Wright will finish his career in the Nationwide Second Division after leaving Celtic to join Burnley until the end of the season. The former Arsenal and England striker has moved from Parkhead on a free transfer after Kenny Dalglish told him he could not be guaranteed first-team football. Wright was signed for Celtic by the former head coach John Barnes as a replacement for Henrik Larsson but, after scoring on his debut in a 5-1 win over Kilmarnock, managed only two further goals. The 36-year-old insists he will retire at the end of the season. Wright is still facing disciplinary action from the Scottish Football Association after he was sent off at Kilmarnock last month following a post-match confrontation with the fourth official. The SFA confirmed last night that any suspension he receives will apply at Burnley. His push on the official and a subsequent unrepentant attitude in a newspaper column could lead to a heavy fine and a lengthy ban. \"Part of his clearance certificate to join Burnley will be that any outstanding disciplinary action will remain against him,\" said an SFA spokesman. \"He may still be required to attend a hearing and, if he has to serve any suspension, the Scottish FA will notify the English FA accordingly. Normal practice is that any ban will still apply. \"There have been several cases like this before, the most high-profile being Duncan Ferguson. It happens from time to time that players move and, if they do so, they take any suspensions with them.\" Wright will almost certainly go straight into the starting line-up for Burnley's match against their fellow promotion hopefuls Wigan at Turf Moor on Saturday as the Clarets' striker Andy Payton begins a three-match suspension. Jonathan Gould has also decided to leave Parkhead after losing his place as the first-choice goalkeeper to Dmitri Kharine but Celtic have turned down an offer from West Ham to take the Scottish international on loan. Gould was dropped after Celtic's 3-1 Scottish Cup defeat to Inverness Caledonian Thistle, during which he was involved in a dressing-room argument with Eyal Berkovic. Newcastle's manager Bobby Robson has been angered by Nolberto Solano's appearance for Peru in the Gold Cup nine days after he left Tyneside with medical reports ruling him out of the competition with thigh trouble. Robson, who had ruled out the midfielder for three weeks, said: \"Has anybody heard from him? Because I haven't.

Forget even more quickly the absurd reports that South Africa's hopes have been wiped out by the chaos that plagued the African Nations Cup, 3,000 miles away in Nigeria. It may have taken place on the same continent but it had as much to do with the South African bid as, say, the unrest in Kosovo has to do with England's. </p> <p>No amount of rhetoric emanating from England, Germany, South Africa, Morocco and Brazil between now and summer will provide a definitive picture of who will vote for whom until the crunch comes. </p> <p>But several potentially crucial trends are emerging. None of the five candidates is likely to win with an overall majority in the first round of balloting, making secondary voting - when Fifa officials switch their votes once their preferred candidate is eliminated - vital. This is why England's campaign leader Alec McGivan, backed by the 2006 special envoy Tony Banks and Bobby Charlton, has clocked up 330,000 miles, much of it targeting areas of the globe which, on paper, would not consider backing England first time round but might thereafter. </p> <p>McGivan, who returned yesterday from Paraguay, where he made a presentation to the Conmebol Congress of South American nations, knows Fifa's three South American officials are certain to support Brazil. But what if Brazil, as could well happen, is asked to withdraw from the bidding because of inadequate facilities? And, should they remain in the campaign, what if they are eliminated in the first ballot? </p> <p>McGivan said last night he was \"very well received\" in Paraguay, where most of his rivals were also canvassing. </p> <p>So far, only four of the 24 Fifa officials have said openly which way they will vote - two of them going for England. Fifa's Scottish vice-president David Will was an unyielding supporter from the outset and New Zealand's Charles Dempsey has also opted publicly for England. Uefa's president Lennart Johansson, still the most staunch advocate of the highly contentious \"gentleman's agreement\" said to have promised full European support for Germany in exchange for giving England Euro 96, will stay loyal to Franz Beckenbauer and his team. Ricardo Teixeira, of Brazil, will back his own country - as long as they are still part of the campaign. </p> <p>Blatter was initially a supporter of South Africa. But he recently softened that stance, under political pressure not to show bias too early. How he will vote is now less certain. </p> <p>More certain is that the campaign is shaping up as a three-horse race between England, for whom support is growing, Germany and South Africa. What worries all three most is that they are unable to canvass entire support within their own continents. Half the eight European Fifa members will probably vote for England, the other half for Germany. This split-vote scenario could, as many predict, benefit South Africa, still marginally favourites. Yet they, too, could lose in exactly the same way, having been unable to persuade Morocco to stand down. </p> <p>English officials believe Morocco's defiance is far more significant than any trouble at the African Nations Cup. \"What happened in Nigeria will have little effect on why South Africa don't win,\" said one source close to the English bid. \"The Morocco question is far more important. In the last two months there has been a definite feeling that the thing is moving away from South Africa.\" </p> <p>Will believes that although South Africa has a stronge emotional pull, the argument that it is Africa's turn may not, in itself, be enough. He does not subscribe to the view of many influential Fifa figures, including Blatter and his predecessor Joao Havelange, that rotation is democratically essential, especially given the many logistical problems facing Japan and South Korea in 2002. </p> <p>\"There is still a strong body of opinion which thinks that Europe should have the World Cup every other time,\" said Will. \"Coming to Europe every 24th year is not correct given where the strength lies in world football. Having said that, South Africa still remains the main challenge to England. Most people are keeping their voting cards to their chests but there is a general belief that it will boil down to South Africa, England andGermany.\" </p> <p>Will is particularly surprised that the Brazilian bid has hardly launched, fuelling the idea that they are saving their powder until 2010. He thinks one candidate will get only two votes - he probably means Morocco - and that England will pick up steam as the process unfolds on July 6. </p> <p>\"I feel England may start quite low in the voting but that they will grow in strength and pick everyone's second vote as others drop away. If Brazil withdraws or comes last in the ballot, for instance, we would have a strong chance of getting the three South American votes.\" </p> <p>The Argentine FA president Julio Grondona, another Fifa executive committee member, will be heavily courted when England meet Argentina at Wembley next week. </p> <p>But for England it could all end in tears if the hooligans get their way at Euro 2000. Just as crime in South Africa continues to hinder their crusade, so street riots a couple of weeks before the voting could scupper England's hopes.

The partner schools are Catholic St Malachy's in Castlewellan and integrated Slemish College in Ballymena. </p> <p>Two other projects, in Birmingham and North Yorkshire, received \u00a35,000 each. Similar amounts will be paid out each half-term in a procedure that is entirely electronic, with schools filling in online application forms and judges assessing them by e-mail. A spokesperson for BT said the judges were unanimous in giving the top award to the Northern Ireland schools. As well as meeting the criteria of having a curriculum focus and promoting communication between schools, the proposal had \"a political and social ambition\" which other applications lacked. Promoting good community relations was very important in the decision. </p> <p>That is where the queasy stomach came in. Could it be a case of British-based judges who know little about good practice in cross-community work in Northern Ireland being overawed by the declared intention to promote trust and understanding? Or were ICT fanatics funding electronic technology when a few bus trips might do more for community relations? </p> <p>Teachers in the schools quickly put these fears to rest. Laurelhill is already closely linked with its local Catholic neighbour, St Patrick's, in curriculum projects, and there are shared activities through Laurelhill Youth Centre. Arnold Carton, head of ICT, who got the project going, is active in cross-community work and devotes a lot of his own time to activities. In July he ran a web summer school for young people from several Catholic and Protestant schools. \"This project is an extension of our existing community relations work,\" he points out. \"Visits are a thing you can have once a term, and we are planning for pupils and teachers at the three schools to meet soon, but with video conferencing we can have contact every fortnight.\" </p> <p>His colleague at St Malachy's, ICT co-ordinator Paddy McElhinney, agrees that it is important for pupils and teachers to meet up from time to time to supplement electronic links. \"I don't want to see pupils on a machine in contact with others without seeing them.\" </p> <p>St Malachy's shares activities with a Protestant school, Glastry, in the Ards Peninsula, but it also has electronic links with schools across the world and hopes to build on these with the new facilities. </p> <p>Cross-community contact will be built into the project in another way. In the first phase, the three schools will create web sites on \"A Young Person's Guide to Lisburn\" or Ballymena or Castlewellan. Pupils will be encouraged to include information on all schools and youth centres in their town, for which they will have to approach the \"other side\". This immediately raises issues about different sports, languages and cultural traditions in the different sectors. The organisers know that these differing experiences of Catholics and Protestants must be handled sensitively. </p> <p>Paul McHugh, senior manager at Slemish College, thinks the task will be easier at his school because pupils have links with all sections of the community. But it will still be a challenge, and even more so in the segregated schools. Paddy McElhinney says a team of pupils at St Malachy's has been discussing the issue: \"We want to involve different ages and religions and I want the pupils to come up with the ideas.\" </p> <p> As the web site develops, pupils in the three schools will use video conferencing to share ideas and offer constructive criticism and support. At the end they will give their impressions of each other's sites. </p> <p>In the second phase, the pupils will link up by video conferencing to agree a joint area of research, and will draw up a questionnaire to find out the views of young people. The findings will be analysed and the results displayed on their web sites. </p> <p>Phase three is expected around November/December of this year, when the schools had hoped to mark the first anniversary of the setting up of the Northern Ireland Executive. The idea can go ahead even if the executive has not been resurrected. Each school will arrange for a local politician to come to the school and be interviewed on what the new political arrangements offer young people. </p> <p>This offers the opportunity for real dialogue among the schools on delicate political issues. The host school will make their politician available to the other schools by video conference, and the interview will be reported on their web site. </p> <p>The project has a strong community relations theme, but its main focus is English. \"This project will encourage communication, both written and verbal,\" says Arnold Carton. \"It will encourage data-handling and develop interpersonal skills. Pupils will gain communications skills not available in English lessons: e-mail, video conferencing and web site production. </p> <p>\"Video conferencing will be important in business in years to come,\" says Pat McHugh. \"We are skilling them up.\"</p>",

In July he ran a web summer school for young people from several Catholic and Protestant schools. \"This project is an extension of our existing community relations work,\" he points out. \"Visits are a thing you can have once a term, and we are planning for pupils and teachers at the three schools to meet soon, but with video conferencing we can have contact every fortnight.\" His colleague at St Malachy's, ICT co-ordinator Paddy McElhinney, agrees that it is important for pupils and teachers to meet up from time to time to supplement electronic links. \"I don't want to see pupils on a machine in contact with others without seeing them.\" St Malachy's shares activities with a Protestant school, Glastry, in the Ards Peninsula, but it also has electronic links with schools across the world and hopes to build on these with the new facilities. Cross-community contact will be built into the project in another way. In the first phase, the three schools will create web sites on \"A Young Person's Guide to Lisburn\" or Ballymena or Castlewellan. Pupils will be encouraged to include information on all schools and youth centres in their town, for which they will have to approach the \"other side\". This immediately raises issues about different sports, languages and cultural traditions in the different sectors. The organisers know that these differing experiences of Catholics and Protestants must be handled sensitively. Paul McHugh, senior manager at Slemish College, thinks the task will be easier at his school because pupils have links with all sections of the community. But it will still be a challenge, and even more so in the segregated schools. Paddy McElhinney says a team of pupils at St Malachy's has been discussing the issue: \"We want to involve different ages and religions and I want the pupils to come up with the ideas.\" As the web site develops, pupils in the three schools will use video conferencing to share ideas and offer constructive criticism and support. At the end they will give their impressions of each other's sites. In the second phase, the pupils will link up by video conferencing to agree a joint area of research, and will draw up a questionnaire to find out the views of young people. The findings will be analysed and the results displayed on their web sites. Phase three is expected around November/December of this year, when the schools had hoped to mark the first anniversary of the setting up of the Northern Ireland Executive. The idea can go ahead even if the executive has not been resurrected. Each school will arrange for a local politician to come to the school and be interviewed on what the new political arrangements offer young people. This offers the opportunity for real dialogue among the schools on delicate political issues. The host school will make their politician available to the other schools by video conference, and the interview will be reported on their web site. The project has a strong community relations theme, but its main focus is English. \"This project will encourage communication, both written and verbal,\" says Arnold Carton. \"It will encourage data-handling and develop interpersonal skills. Pupils will gain communications skills not available in English lessons: e-mail, video conferencing and web site production. \"Video conferencing will be important in business in years to come,\" says Pat McHugh. \"We are skilling them up.\"",

      "bodyText": "In what appeared to be a decisive rejection of President Robert Mugabe's proposals to reform Zimbabwe's constitution, early results yesterday indicated overwhelming \"No\" votes in Harare and Bulawayo, the country's two largest cities. Other cities were also reporting rejection of the changes, which include prolonging Mr Mugabe's term and giving the government authority to seize mostly white-owned farms without compensation to resettle blacks. A low turnout in rural areas, which hold 70% of Zimbabwe's 12m people, means that the urban vote could decide the results of the referendum. Heavy rain has delayed the transport of ballot boxes from rural areas and final results are expected today. The state-controlled media have already begun reporting partial results that indicate a negative vote, after weeks of campaigning for a \"Yes\" vote. Lovemore Madhuku, the spokesman for the National Constitutional Assembly (NCA), which opposes the constitutional changes, said: \"People are showing they are opposed to this undemocratic constitution.\" He added that the Mugabe government \"did not anticipate the magnitude of the No votes in the urban areas. Now that they have been taken by surprise, they will find it hard to cheat enough to win this referendum. They cannot announce Yes votes from the cities, and not enough people voted in the rural areas to outweigh the urban votes.\" The government has begun blaming the white minority for the No vote. The state Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation and the Herald newspaper yesterday reported that large numbers of whites had encouraged their employees to vote against the constitution. \"They are trying to promote racial tensions where there are none,\" Mr Madhuku said. \"The government thinks the Zimbabwean people are so foolish they will think that the whites are demons. But the government misjudged the situation. Whites are no longer seen as responsible for the people's suffering.\" Others were more cautious about the results. \"We have not won yet, and we know the government does not want to lose this,\"' said Isaac Maphosa, NCA chairman. \"We had monitors in most urban centres, but many rural voting areas did not have monitors. There are reports of irregularities in many rural areas. The government could still try to pull off a victory.\" Human rights lawyer Tendai Biti, women's activist Priscilla Misihairabwi and seven other opposition supporters remained in jail for a second night. They were arrested on Sunday while campaigning in Harare's Highfields township. The opposition ran a lively campaign on a shoestring budget, tying posters on to trees and handing out leaflets in workplaces. Thousands of monitors were mobilised to watch polling stations. As counting continued last night, arguments broke out between monitors and government officials over the appearance of ballot boxes which had not been monitored. Government officials seemed shocked that the referendum would be defeated. \"This is a decisive day for Mugabe, it appears to be a decisive defeat,\" said Iden Wetherell, deputy editor of the Zimbabwe Independent. \"The early results indicate a massive rejection not only of the draft constitution, but of Mugabe's rule and mismanagement. Things will never be the same.\"",

Social workers, care home staff, local authorities, police and the Welsh office were severely criticised by the report into the UK's worst welfare scandal. Speaking in the Commons today, Welsh secretary Paul Murphy said the victims were subject to \"appalling suffering\". Mr Murphy told MPs: \"In its report the tribunal has named many people: alleged abusers, convicted abusers, local government officers and elected members and Welsh office officials.\" The report concluded that there was widespread sexual abuse of boys, and to a lesser extent of girls, in local authority and privately-run children's residential establishments and schools and in a NHS psychiatric unit in Clwyd between 1974 and 1990. Children at the homes were also subjected to a \"climate of violence\" by staff who used \"impermissable force\" and condoned and even encouraged bullying, the report said. Mr Murphy said there was no evidence of persistent sexual abuse in children's residential establishments in Gwynedd, but that sexual and physical abuse did occur in a small number of children's homes in the county. But there was a paedophile ring in the Wrexham and Chester areas that preyed on teenage boys, he said. These children were especially vulnerable because they were in care. In total, the long-awaited report of the tribunal of inquiry into abuse at the children's homes runs to 500,000 words and makes 72 recommendations about how some of the country's most vulnerable youngsters should be protected. The inquiry also found that children were also being abused by the people appointed to deal with their complaints.

The three-strong inquiry panel, headed by former High Court judge Sir Ronald Waterhouse, strongly criticised the \"cult of silence\" which allowed the abuse to continue for years, despite repeated allegations and half-hearted investigations by police and social services. Children had complained as early as 1978 about abuse, but four damning reports in the early eighties about the state of homes in Clwyd were suppressed by the council. It was only in 1996, after a string of high-profile prosecutions of former staff at the children's homes, that the then Welsh secretary, William Hague, ordered the public inquiry. One of the victims told today how he was abused both physically and sexually within a week of arriving at Bersham Hall. Steven Messham, now chair of Norwas (North Wales Abuse of Survivors), said the abuse lasted for three-and-a-half months.

      "body": "<p>After working as a GP in south London for a few years, with the constant stresses and strains that come with life in a big city, I decided to move to the provinces. I chose the west country, where I'd long dreamed of living. </p> <p>Finding the right practice to join is always difficult, so since I had no knowledge of GPs in the area, I decided to work as a locum at first. I thought I'd get to know the different partnerships before applying for a permanent position. </p> <p>Locuming is the equivalent of working freelance. You fill in for other doctors who are away, say, or off sick or on study leave. It is usually on a very short-term basis, commonly just a morning or afternoon, and you can be booked in at the last minute. </p> <p>I began by sending out my curriculum vitae with the names of two referees to all the practices in the district. Five came back with offers of work. Before taking up any of them, I asked my referees how many had been in contact. To my surprise, they reported that nobody had asked for a reference. </p> <p>On the day of my first locum job - by chance, the day that Harold Shipman was found guilty - I was due to be the only working doctor in a nearby practice. I loaded my bag with medical items, but also copies of my certificates from the General Medical Council, the joint committee on postgraduate training for general practice, and for medical indemnity. </p> <p>Never having worked as a locum before, I imagined that I would have to produce them before seeing patients. I also thought that the practices would contact the relevant bodies to confirm the certificates were genuine. As an extra precaution, I took along my passport, expecting to show it as positive proof of identity. </p> <p>But when I got there, no checks were made. It's fair to say I was extremely concerned. I wasn't asked to show any documentation at all, even when I informed them that I had brought it all with me. In that practice I did meet the partners, who asked a little about me - who I was, where I was living and why I had left London - but then, with no further formalities, I was given a room, shown how to use the computer and presented with my first patient. </p> <p>Within 10 minutes of starting my surgery, an urgent house call was requested. As with all calls for home visits, I prioritised it - was it urgent, or could it wait a little while? As the request was to visit a woman with diarrhoea and vomiting, I decided to delay the visit until after my surgery was finished. The woman's husband agreed, but few minutes later was back on the phone saying his wife was getting worse. I had no choice but to leave the patients in the waiting room and visit the woman immediately. </p> <p>By the time I got there, however, the woman had died. I tried to resuscitate her, but it was too late. </p> <p>The day had hardly begun, and of the two patients I'd seen, one was already dead. As the dead woman had not been seen by a doctor from the surgery for three months, her death was referred to the coroner and a post-mortem was arranged. </p> <p>To my relief this meant I was not asked to issue the death certificate for a patient I had never previously met. (I assume the post-mortem has shown a natural cause of death.) I spent the rest of the day concerned that the practice would wonder whether I had done something I should not have done, and was relieved when the day ended with everything else running smoothly. </p> <p>In the last two weeks, I've gone on to work in a further five practices, and only two have asked to see my certificates. </p> <p>Another cause for concern is that each of the practices has given me a prescription pad in case I cannot use the computer to print one out. Last year the government introduced new prescriptions to try and counter fraudulent use. These pads are supposed to be signed out for use by the relevant doctor, to ensure each one is accounted for. But not once have I been asked to sign for the pack and only in one practice have I had to make a record of what I have used. </p> <p> It would be extremely easy to pocket a few empty scripts for use at a later date, which would mean I could easily obtain controlled drugs such as diamorphine - the drug Shipman used to kill his patients. </p> <p>In one of the practices I have covered, the only member of staff I met was a receptionist. I found it very worrying that the partners were willing to entrust the care of their patients to a complete stranger, without even saying hello. It seems to show a lack of respect to their patients, and to me, as well as a disregard for their livelihood. If I'd made a bad mistake, they'd be dealing with the consequences of it for years to come. </p> <p>Interested in finding out how common my experience was, I spoke to doctors locuming in other parts of the country. They all reported similar circumstances. Some practices do ask for copies of all certificates before offering work, but a substantial number ignore such precautions. </p> <p>There appears to be no legal duty on general practices to check certificates, although some health authorities are beginning to tighten up. Oxfordshire for example, has recently written to all GPs strongly advising them to obtain certificates from locums, and ring the General Medical Council for verification. </p> <p>In the wake of the Shipman case, and numerous cases of impersonation of medical professionals, surely there is a need for a firm set of rules on how to hire a locum? I would suggest a minimum of GMC, JCPTGP, indemnity certificates and passport or birth certificate to be supplied by the locum before they turn up, so that they can be checked with the relevant authorities. The practice should also have copies of suitable references on file. </p> <p>This may not prevent another Shipman, but would present better cover for the practice and its patients, and a feeling of working in an organised and safe atmosphere for the locum.

Last April, a report entitled Looking to the Future was published, identifying the discrepancy in the amount of heart disease suffered by low and high-income brackets.

In 1999, that figure was more than 30%. </p> <p>\"I'm worried about people thinking we are a healthy-eating nation,\" says Professor Klim McPherson, who contributed to the study. \"It has been apparent for quite a long time that we're high up in the coronary heart disease stakes - even in comparison with America and Australia.\" The study highlighted not only the relationship between diet and health, but between health and habit. </p> <p>\"The problem is that in some European countries you just eat a more healthy diet because it's how you are brought up: to eat more fruit and vegetables and to drink wine, which is of course very good for your coronary arteries. Your attitude is dominated by where you're born and brought up and what is made available to you.\" </p> <p>This question of attitude might be linked to the vague British resentment of interference from the busy-body state and a suspicion of scientists who appear to change their minds every other week. \"In the past, we've had some adverse influences from people saying cholesterol didn't matter,\" says Poulter, \"and there have been arguments about the harmfulness of salt in this country, when everyone else in the world acknowledges that there's too much salt and it's not necessary.

But Dr Elizabeth Dowler, of Warwick University's department of social policy and social work, is doubtful that unhealthy eating has much to do with the public's distrust of nutritionists: \"There is a strong view that the trouble with nutritionists is they are always changing their minds, and I don't think it is particularly true.

      "body": "<p>I am lying face down on a fold-out couch in my front room under a towel, wearing only knickers and bra, wishing I'd turned the heating up. Guy Mitchell, Bowen technique practitioner, is crouched outside the door. After getting me to strip off and lie down, he has prodded my lower leg then left the room. He is, he says, putting himself outside my \"energy field\". We wait like this for a minute while my body allegedly \"resets and heals itself\". </p> <p>The Bowen technique was developed in Australia in the 1950s by Tom Bowen, who modestly said his healing power was \"simply a gift from God\". Word spread and soon people were struggling across Australia to him with their untreatable ailments. Most of those who turn to the technique suffer from persistent complaints such as backache that conventional medicine hasn't healed. Bowen practitioners say, though, that it will cure anything from asthma to PMT, from bunions to anxiety. </p> <p>Bowen is a less worrying therapy than bone-crunching osteopathy. There are no sudden moves or uncomfortable noises. Instead, the practitioner performs a series of light prods on various muscles which are, apparently, fine-tuned to channel \"natural energy\" into problem areas. They will, says Mitchell, \"empower the body's own resources to heal itself\". How, exactly, this takes place is a divine mystery. But with a claimed 9,000 practitioners world wide it must work for someone. </p> <p>Mitchell himself discovered Bowen after a car crash left both his shoulders locked. He was told by doctors that he'd always be in pain, but after a course of Bowen, he was a new man. </p> <p>I am hoping the treatment will heal my niggling lower back pain and pep me up generally. Mitchell claims it will, and suggests a \"body balance\". This takes about 30 minutes and is what most people having Bowen for the first time can expect: a series of gentle pokes to the back, knees, shoulders and neck.

      "bodyText": "I am lying face down on a fold-out couch in my front room under a towel, wearing only knickers and bra, wishing I'd turned the heating up. Guy Mitchell, Bowen technique practitioner, is crouched outside the door. After getting me to strip off and lie down, he has prodded my lower leg then left the room. He is, he says, putting himself outside my \"energy field\". We wait like this for a minute while my body allegedly \"resets and heals itself\". The Bowen technique was developed in Australia in the 1950s by Tom Bowen, who modestly said his healing power was \"simply a gift from God\". Word spread and soon people were struggling across Australia to him with their untreatable ailments. Most of those who turn to the technique suffer from persistent complaints such as backache that conventional medicine hasn't healed. Bowen practitioners say, though, that it will cure anything from asthma to PMT, from bunions to anxiety. Bowen is a less worrying therapy than bone-crunching osteopathy. There are no sudden moves or uncomfortable noises. Instead, the practitioner performs a series of light prods on various muscles which are, apparently, fine-tuned to channel \"natural energy\" into problem areas. They will, says Mitchell, \"empower the body's own resources to heal itself\". How, exactly, this takes place is a divine mystery. But with a claimed 9,000 practitioners world wide it must work for someone. Mitchell himself discovered Bowen after a car crash left both his shoulders locked. He was told by doctors that he'd always be in pain, but after a course of Bowen, he was a new man. I am hoping the treatment will heal my niggling lower back pain and pep me up generally. Mitchell claims it will, and suggests a \"body balance\". This takes about 30 minutes and is what most people having Bowen for the first time can expect: a series of gentle pokes to the back, knees, shoulders and neck. These pokes are called \"cross-fibre muscle manipulations\", and feel like a thumb pressed down deep into the muscle, twiddled slightly, then released. Once I've got used to Mitchell slinking in and out of the room, and have stopped worrying about whether it's going to hurt, the treatment turns out to be quite relaxing. The whole 30 minutes is carried out in companionable silence, and I assume my body must be doing something, as I feel less cold and my muscles even buzz a little.

Well, I didn't: I ate a salad, drank water, watched a movie, read the New Yorker from cover to cover, and was moved by Horowitz playing Schubert's Serenade in a recording made in his New York flat when he was over 80.

I spend 10 minutes on a walking machine that simulates cross- country skiing (no problem); 10 minutes running on a treadmill (enjoyable - my heart rate shoots up worryingly before it stabilises) and six minutes on a bike (very dull).

All these are designed to get the heart working and improve stamina levels, but I will also need to do some running outside the gym. </p> <p>The other half of each one-hour session is spent on weights.

If you can simultaneously increase your muscle tissue and reduce your body weight, this becomes a cinch.

It all ends in blood, sweat and tears (not necessarily in that order). Why are you doing it, someone asks the Spacey character - to increase strength or stamina? To look good naked, he replies with admirable candour. My motives are of course far less crudely physical: I want to be a productive worker, a good citizen, a well-rounded (metaphorically speaking) human being; I'm not doing this for me, but for mankind. </p> <p>My first report produced a lot of reasonably good-natured abuse from friends and colleagues, and two letters. The first, from the head of leisure services at Fenland District Council, told me that if an investment of \u00a3600-plus a month on a personal trainer became too much, I could join a Fenland leisure centre for \u00a328. Well worth considering, although I have become rather hooked on my trainer Sam's psychological support.

And how many grapes?\" demanded my correspondent. Just for the record: one piece of fruit includes a whole apple, banana or pear, or a cupful of grapes or something similar. The same correspondent thought two litres of water a day impossible and said I must have to get up throughout the night. Well, I haven't been measuring the quantity precisely, but I have been drinking a great deal more water, without so far having my sleep disturbed. I am drinking a lot during the intensive one-hour exercise session, and making sure I drink cups of water throughout the day in our hot, unhealthily dehydrated office. It's really a question of substituting water for tea, coffee, cola and booze, so the overall quantity of liquid is not much changed. </p> <p>I am keen to be a bit of a force for collective change, so I asked Sam for some healthy tips that everyone can follow. You see, he's your personal trainer, too. Here goes: </p> <p><strong>1 </strong> Reduce fat intake to 20% of your total calories. Cut down the fatty foods - fried foods, chips and cakes. </p> <p><strong>2 </strong> Eat more fruit and veg. </p> <p><strong>3 </strong> Eat natural foods rather than processed foods, which are filled with sugar, salt and chemicals. </p> <p><strong>4 </strong> Drink lots of water and cut down on tea and, especially, coffee. Drink two cups of coffee a day, max. (My gym is right next to a Starbucks with a comfy armchair and this is proving a bit of a problem; my motto at the moment appears to be better latte than never. Sorry, Sam.) </p> <p><strong>5 </strong> Do a minimum of 20 minutes of cardio-vascular exercise three times a week - running, biking, rowing, walking at a pace fast enough to get your heart rate up (don't overdo it though, especially at first). </p> <p><strong>6 </strong> Exercise will also reduce stress: a brisk 30-minute walk will do you a lot of good mentally and physically. (Apparently, it produces endorphins in the brain, and that is good for you.) </p> <p><strong>7 </strong> Try weight training at home: cans of beans can make perfect dumb-bells (but don't drop one of the family-sized cans on your foot). </p> <p><strong>8 </strong> Try some push-ups (extremely hard work) and squats. </p> <p><strong>9 </strong> Do regular stretching exercises - hamstrings, calves, chest, shoulder blades. </p> <p><strong>10 </strong> Swim regularly - good cardio-vascular exercise and, since it isn't weight-bearing or impactive, excellent for people with sore joints. </p> <p>I'd like to add one more tip. Make some time for yourself, turn off the lights, sit alone in a darkened room and put on a CD of Horowitz playing Schubert or Chopin. There, you feel better already. </p> <p>\u0095 Stephen Moss is working out at Matt Roberts at One, a health club at 1 Aldwych, London WC2 (tel: 0171 300 0600).</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> How to keep kids asleep </strong></p> <p> <strong> Q:</strong> I've got three kids and none of them have managed to sleep through the night until they reach the age of five. Cumulatively, I've been sleep-deprived for nearly a decade now. I have to admit that I resort to dosing my two-year-old with a couple of liberal teaspoons of Piriton syrup, since my GP told me that's what she did with her kids. Is that OK and is there anything better? </p> <p> <strong> A: </strong> When my first child finally slept through the whole night (aged about six), my mother-in-law warned me: \"You'll never sleep properly again, you know!\" And she was right. One in five under-threes and one in 10 four to five-year-olds sleep badly enough for their parents to seek help, often from a health visitor or GP. It makes mums feel ill, and relationships suffer. Sedation with antihistamines or more powerful prescription drugs is a common response, but it doesn't work in the long term: it can buy you one night's sleep, but won't have any impact after four weeks. </p> <p>Giving drugs to children is not ideal - they might become drowsy during the day or you might be one of the unlucky minority whose child becomes more active when given antihistamines. A recent report in the British Medical Journal confirms the benefits of a 20-minute wind-down routine which is begun five to 10 minutes earlier each week until you arrive at the desired bedtime. This needs to be coupled with ignoring bedtime tantrums for preset time intervals. </p> <p>For kids who wake several times a night, waking the child 15 to 60 minutes before they usually wake, then resettling them, can help. No one behavioural strategy works better than any other, but all are better than drugs in the long term. </p> <p><strong> Q:</strong> About a year ago, after prolonged breathlessness, I was diagosed as having an irregular heartbeat. My GP referred me to a specialist and I was prescribed amiodarone and warfarin for six weeks. When this had no effect I had cardioversion. This resulted in a regular pulse but when the amiodarone was stopped I reverted to the irregular heartbeat. The specialist said that nothing else could be done and that I should come back when I get worse. My GP is \"not worried\". I continue to take warfarin plus beta blockers and train regularly at a fitness centre. I do not push myself, but my pulse varies wildly: up or down 10-15 bpm is not unusual. Should I be worried? </p> <p><strong> A:</strong> It sounds as though you had an irregular heartbeat known as atrial fibrillation (AF). The upper chambers of the heart (atria) fire off ineffective, chaotic, irregular and rapid bursts of electrical activity. It can cause palpitations, breathlessness or merely an irregular pulse, often picked up by chance. AF can be a sign of underlying heart disease, high blood pressure or an overactive thyroid. </p> <p>If there's no underlying cause, as in your case, it's known as \"lone AF\". Cardiologists usually suggest one go at giving the heart a big electric shock to try to tip it into normal electrical activity (cardioversion). Your blood is thinned with an anticoagulant, warfarin, before and after cardioversion because there's a small risk that when the heart changes from AF to normal rhythm or vice versa, small clots can be thrown out of the heart, which may cause a stroke. A lot of people slip back into AF after cardioversion. </p> <p>Drugs such as amiodarone, digoxin or beta blockers (eg sotalol) may not return the heart to normal rhythm but they make it beat more slowly so you get fewer symptoms, and there is less strain on the heart. </p> <p> <strong> Foreskin trouble </strong></p> <p><strong> Q:</strong> My foreskin keeps adhering to the lower part of the glans of my penis. It becomes itchy and feels painful during sexual intercourse. To counteract the effects, I pull it away, which hurts and causes bleeding, but gradually it sticks again. Circumcision has been recommended, but at the age of 54 I do not wish to have surgery if a less radical solution can be found. Is there one? </p> <p><strong> A:</strong> Your unfortunate condition is called a paraphimosis and tends to happen if the foreskin is a bit tight. As you say, the retracted foreskin gets trapped behind the glans, especially when the penis is erect. The glans gets engorged and swollen so it becomes even harder to slide the foreskin forward again. You can squeeze the glans for half an hour to reduce the swelling (ouch!) or soak a piece of gauze in a sugar solution and hold over the glans for an hour. But if it happens time and again, circumcision may be the best option. </p> <p> \u0095 These answers are intended to be as accurate and full as possible, but should never be used as a substitute for visiting a doctor and seeking medical help.

The specialist said that nothing else could be done and that I should come back when I get worse. My GP is \"not worried\". I continue to take warfarin plus beta blockers and train regularly at a fitness centre. I do not push myself, but my pulse varies wildly: up or down 10-15 bpm is not unusual. Should I be worried? A: It sounds as though you had an irregular heartbeat known as atrial fibrillation (AF). The upper chambers of the heart (atria) fire off ineffective, chaotic, irregular and rapid bursts of electrical activity. It can cause palpitations, breathlessness or merely an irregular pulse, often picked up by chance. AF can be a sign of underlying heart disease, high blood pressure or an overactive thyroid. If there's no underlying cause, as in your case, it's known as \"lone AF\". Cardiologists usually suggest one go at giving the heart a big electric shock to try to tip it into normal electrical activity (cardioversion). Your blood is thinned with an anticoagulant, warfarin, before and after cardioversion because there's a small risk that when the heart changes from AF to normal rhythm or vice versa, small clots can be thrown out of the heart, which may cause a stroke. A lot of people slip back into AF after cardioversion. Drugs such as amiodarone, digoxin or beta blockers (eg sotalol) may not return the heart to normal rhythm but they make it beat more slowly so you get fewer symptoms, and there is less strain on the heart. Foreskin trouble Q: My foreskin keeps adhering to the lower part of the glans of my penis. It becomes itchy and feels painful during sexual intercourse. To counteract the effects, I pull it away, which hurts and causes bleeding, but gradually it sticks again. Circumcision has been recommended, but at the age of 54 I do not wish to have surgery if a less radical solution can be found. Is there one? A: Your unfortunate condition is called a paraphimosis and tends to happen if the foreskin is a bit tight. As you say, the retracted foreskin gets trapped behind the glans, especially when the penis is erect. The glans gets engorged and swollen so it becomes even harder to slide the foreskin forward again. You can squeeze the glans for half an hour to reduce the swelling (ouch!) or soak a piece of gauze in a sugar solution and hold over the glans for an hour. But if it happens time and again, circumcision may be the best option. \u0095 These answers are intended to be as accurate and full as possible, but should never be used as a substitute for visiting a doctor and seeking medical help.

      "trailText": "The most pressing problem facing the countryside is not the hunting issue, but the increasing lack of resources - something the Countryside Alliance needs to address if it is to have an impact on country life, says <B>David McKie</B>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Although Tony Blair believes that the traumas of rural life are sometimes exaggerated, his government does not dispute that country-dwellers, and especially farmers, have problems, and it hopes to do something about them. To this end it is busy consulting some of the relevant organisations. Some, but not others - the most striking exclusion being one of the best supported: the Countryside Alliance.</p> <p>It was the Countryside Alliance which mustered thousands of people of every county and every class to demonstrate in London, so being shunned in this way is making it very cross. But its protests will go unheeded. Ministers think the alliance is simply a clever front for defenders of hunting. Aware that large majorities, even in country areas, support the banning of hunting, its inventors constructed the alliance to make hunting appear to be part of a wider countryside cause, taking in poverty, unemployment, the decline of the rural school, the death of the rural shop, and so on.</p> <p>The alliance likes to pretend that all these issues are seamlessly interwoven. That is the case its officials make, and it is also made in various newspapers by various notable country-dwellers sympathetic to hunting. John Mortimer, for instance - playwright, novelist, creator of Rumpole and general good egg. He wrote a sizeable piece in the Observer about the village in the Chilterns where he has lived for 70 years. He did not name this village, but it sounds to me suspiciously like Turville, Bucks, whose inhabitants also include such gnarled straw-chewing rustics as Jeremy Paxman.</p> <p>When he was a child, he wrote, the village had three pubs, three shops, a post office, two schools, two churches, a chapel and a bus into town. Now it has no shops, no post office and no bus, and - most fatal of all - no school. One of the pubs has gone and a second is soon to become a commuter residence. People who grew up in the village cannot afford homes of their own when they marry because the commuters have driven up prices beyond their means. One local farmer, hit as so many have been by the crisis in the industry, is making a profit of \u00a39 a week to keep himself and his family.</p> <p>The philosopher Roger Scruton marshalled a similar case for his village in Wiltshire. But each of these pieces slipped in a significant thought at the end. John Mortimer did it almost in passing: the fox-hunting issue, he said, simply confirmed rural suspicions that urban MPs do not understand the countryside. Roger Scruton pitched his defence on a higher plane. Yes, schools and churches and pubs bound rural communities together; but what united them most of all, he maintained, was the hunt.</p> <p>When philosophers speak, we tend to listen in awe. They are not mere polemicists, but seekers after the truth. And yet this conclusion is tosh. There are many harmonious country communities scattered across the land where the hunt is never seen. If you made a map of Britain and coloured in the areas where hunts operate, howling great gaps would be left. And while it's true that the threat to hunting leaves even some non-hunters in villages baffled, its disappearance would hardly make the dent in their lives which the loss of church and chapel, pub, post office and school inflicts on their communities.</p> <p>The moral for the Countryside Alliance is obvious.

      "bodyText": "Although Tony Blair believes that the traumas of rural life are sometimes exaggerated, his government does not dispute that country-dwellers, and especially farmers, have problems, and it hopes to do something about them. To this end it is busy consulting some of the relevant organisations. Some, but not others - the most striking exclusion being one of the best supported: the Countryside Alliance. It was the Countryside Alliance which mustered thousands of people of every county and every class to demonstrate in London, so being shunned in this way is making it very cross. But its protests will go unheeded. Ministers think the alliance is simply a clever front for defenders of hunting. Aware that large majorities, even in country areas, support the banning of hunting, its inventors constructed the alliance to make hunting appear to be part of a wider countryside cause, taking in poverty, unemployment, the decline of the rural school, the death of the rural shop, and so on. The alliance likes to pretend that all these issues are seamlessly interwoven. That is the case its officials make, and it is also made in various newspapers by various notable country-dwellers sympathetic to hunting. John Mortimer, for instance - playwright, novelist, creator of Rumpole and general good egg. He wrote a sizeable piece in the Observer about the village in the Chilterns where he has lived for 70 years. He did not name this village, but it sounds to me suspiciously like Turville, Bucks, whose inhabitants also include such gnarled straw-chewing rustics as Jeremy Paxman. When he was a child, he wrote, the village had three pubs, three shops, a post office, two schools, two churches, a chapel and a bus into town. Now it has no shops, no post office and no bus, and - most fatal of all - no school. One of the pubs has gone and a second is soon to become a commuter residence. People who grew up in the village cannot afford homes of their own when they marry because the commuters have driven up prices beyond their means. One local farmer, hit as so many have been by the crisis in the industry, is making a profit of \u00a39 a week to keep himself and his family. The philosopher Roger Scruton marshalled a similar case for his village in Wiltshire. But each of these pieces slipped in a significant thought at the end. John Mortimer did it almost in passing: the fox-hunting issue, he said, simply confirmed rural suspicions that urban MPs do not understand the countryside. Roger Scruton pitched his defence on a higher plane. Yes, schools and churches and pubs bound rural communities together; but what united them most of all, he maintained, was the hunt. When philosophers speak, we tend to listen in awe. They are not mere polemicists, but seekers after the truth. And yet this conclusion is tosh. There are many harmonious country communities scattered across the land where the hunt is never seen. If you made a map of Britain and coloured in the areas where hunts operate, howling great gaps would be left. And while it's true that the threat to hunting leaves even some non-hunters in villages baffled, its disappearance would hardly make the dent in their lives which the loss of church and chapel, pub, post office and school inflicts on their communities. The moral for the Countryside Alliance is obvious. If it really wants to halt and then reverse the steady decay of traditional rural life, let it campaign on the issues that really matter. If it dropped its commitment to what it calls field sports and others call blood sports, it would find official doors opening, right up to Number 10's. But it won't, of course, since trying to save hunting is its very essence, its raison d'\u00eatre, and the rest is merely convenient cover.

Der Grund: Viele f\u00fcrchten sich vor der Macht der Freiheitlichen Partei \u00d6sterreichs (FP\u00d6). Ihr Chef, J\u00f6rg Haider, f\u00e4ll zu oft auf. Seine rechtspopulistischen \u00c4u\u00dferungen rufen Argwohn hervor. Nicht nur in \u00d6sterreich, sondern auch im Ausland. Die Europ\u00e4ische Union will die diplomatischen Beziehungen zu \u00d6sterreich abbrechen. Israels Botschafter ist aus dem Land abgereist. Die \u00d6sterreicher gehen gegen die Koalition auf die Stra\u00dfe. Doch Haider und sein Partner Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel (\u00d6VP) arbeiten an ihrem Programm. Unbeirrt versuchen sie, ihr Land voranzubringen. Viele Leute sind skeptisch, ob dies gelingen wird. Sie bef\u00fcrchten, da\u00df Haider die ausl\u00e4ndischen Investoren vertreiben wird.

His teacher and friend Yvor Winters described him as having \"the temperament of a mystical Calvinist\" though with \"too good a mind to accept the Calvinist faith or any other\". He was, indeed, brought up as a Presbyterian. </p> <p>Bowers experienced a brief period of prominence in the early 1960s. In Britain, for instance, he was anthologised both by Donald Hall and by Thom Gunn and Ted Hughes, but today, even among committed readers of poetry, his name is little known. </p> <p>Yet the list of his admirers is impressive, including Robert Lowell, Richard Wilbur, Geoffrey Hill, Tony Tanner and Harold Bloom, who placed him in his tally of modern immortals in the western canon. Winters thought the poems in his early books \"among the best American poems\" of the 20th century. He was the recipient of several important prizes and fellowships, including the prestigious Bollingen prize. </p> <p>Born in Rome, Georgia, Bowers matriculated at the University of North Carolina in 1942, but was called up for military service the following year. In 1945, at 21, he travelled across the ruins of Europe to be stationed for a year in Hitler's retreat at Berchtesgaden, where he was active in the de-Nazification campaign. The impact of these sights and experiences on a sensitive and ethical consciousness can be felt throughout his Collected Poems (1997). </p> <p>At the end of the war, Bowers returned to his studies, then in 1947, drawn by the reputation of Yvor Winters, departed for California. He studied under Winters at Stanford University, attended its celebrated writing programme and completed his doctorate on the poems of Yeats's friend and contemporary, T Sturge Moore. A conventional academic career followed: jobs at Duke University, Harpur College and the University of California at Santa Barbara, from 1958 to 1991. </p> <p>Bowers was an effective and sometimes charismatic teacher, but he was never wholly at home in an English faculty. He fought against political compromises (over Vietnam, for instance) and the exploitation of young, untenured teachers. He sometimes suffered from sneering suggestions about his homosexuality, and, despite being the most radical and egalitarian of men, stood accused of elitism. </p> <p>His poetry falls into roughly two periods. The Form Of Loss (1956) and The Astronomers (1965) consist mainly of poems in immaculately constructed, rhymed stanzas, in which the influence of Val\u00e9ry, and perhaps of Wallace Stevens, is noticeable. The mood is tragic. Among his masterpieces is The Astronomers Of Mont Blanc, in which his protagonists gaze from their \"icy tower\" into \"the colder distances\": </p> <p> It is your hope that you will </p> <p>know the end </p> <p>And compass of our </p> <p>ignorant restraint </p> <p>There in lost time, where </p> <p>what was done is done </p> <p>Forever as a havoc </p> <p>overhead. </p> <p>Aging, you search to master </p> <p>in the faint </p> <p>Persistent fortune that you </p> <p>gaze upon </p> <p>The perfect order trusted to </p> <p>the dead. </p> <p>The sombre dignity of this - with its language slightly removed from everyday usage - has been characterised by the critic Gordon Harvey as \"newness of sense, antiquity of voice\". </p> <p>In his second phase, Bowers's manner is less antique. From 1965 to the mid-1980s he wrote little, perhaps inhibited by bouts of depression and alcoholism. When the clouds lifted, however, he entered his most sustained creative phase. </p> <p>For Louis Pasteur, and most of the new pieces in his Collected Poems, are more relaxed in manner. Almost all are in a supple and subtly musical blank verse. This is a medium mostly associated with longer works of narrative or description, but these are short meditations, hospitable to casual observation, bits of quirky humour and conversational phrases. They are sometimes allusive and appear discontinuous. But closer reading reveals the same Jamesian feeling for elaborations of syntax, and an underlying thread of rational argument. The emphasis is more social than personal, in particular a concern for the fragmentation and casual nihilism of post-modern society. </p> <p>But Bowers was not a pessimist by nature. To British friends, he exemplified a pattern of American openness and practicality. He retained a hint of his old accent, and a certain southern courtliness of manner.

      "bodyText": "Robert Mugabe appeared to be heading for defeat in Zimbabwe's constitutional referendum, in what would be the biggest electoral rebuff for the country's president after two decades of virtually unchallenged rule. With three-quarters of the votes counted, the state's Elections Directorate said 56.5% were opposed to the constitutional changes, which would allow Mr Mugabe to stay in power for another 12 years and permit his government to seize land owned by white settlers without paying compensation. Opposition leaders claimed victory: \"We are heading for a win unless they manipulated the vote from the rural areas in a big way,\" said Lovemeore Madhuku, deputy chairman of the National Constitutional Assembly, a coalition of civic and opposition groups that campaigned against the new constitution. Independent monitors provided by civic groups and churches have said they could reach only about two-thirds of voting stations because the Elections Directorate only announced each voting location on Friday, raising fears of electoral irregularities. Over the weekend, police arrested a top opposition leader and eight supporters in the western Harare township of Highfields for alleged illegal campaigning and incitement to violence. The group are still being held in police cells and are expected to appear in court today. The vote is an indication of Mr Mugabe's waning popularity as Zimbabwe faces its worst economic crisis since independence from British colonial rule in 1980. The Zimbabwe leader's party could now face another defeat in parliamentary elections to be held in early April. It has won landslide victories in every poll since independence and currently holds all but three seats in the 150-member parliament. \"No\" votes dominated 49 districts, many of them in towns, in results declared after overnight counting, chief elections officer Tobaiwa Mudede reported. In 89 of the nation's 120 voting districts, opponents of the new constitution posted 532,800 ballots. Supporters of Mr Mugabe polled 409,380 votes and took the majority in 40 mostly rural areas. Mr Mugabe's largest defeat came in central Harare, where 16,882 voters rejected adoption of the new constitution and 4,821 favoured it. Analysts expect the \"yes\" campaign to claw back some ground in rural areas where the ruling ZANU-PF party commands a large following. During polling on Saturday, lines for scarce kerosene, used by the poor for cooking, lighting and heating, were longer than those at polling booths. Shortages of gasoline and power blamed on economic mismanagement by the government have crippled transport, agriculture and industry in recent months. Inflation and unemployment have soared to record levels.",

In a damaging intervention which will overshadow Mr Hague's launch today of his Save the Pound tour of Britain, former frontbencher John Maples paints a picture of the Conservative leader holed up in his \"bunker\" at central office, surrounded by inexperienced junior officials but \"almost completely cut off\" from his own shadow cabinet. Mr Maples, sacked by Mr Hague as shadow foreign secretary in a reshuffle two weeks ago, warns of the \"danger\" that rightwingers are now shadowing most government departments, while moderates are in lower profile backroom jobs. And he reveals that, despite \"several attempts\", he never managed to have a serious discussion of foreign policy with his party leader, nor to convince him that Jeffrey Archer would \"get us into trouble\" as mayoral candidate. The critique, though presented as comradely advice from a colleague now \"outside the bunker\", amounts to one of the most outspoken assaults on Mr Hague's political judgment and leadership ability during his career as leader. Though the party leadership is certain to play down the remarks, contained in an open letter to Mr Hague in the Times, as the revenge of an embittered former front bencher, the criticism will be seen as reflecting unease among other moderates in the Conservative party.

      "bodyText": "Tory leader William Hague is today warned that his party faces certain electoral defeat unless it reverses a shift to the right and promotes mainstream one-nation policies. In a damaging intervention which will overshadow Mr Hague's launch today of his Save the Pound tour of Britain, former frontbencher John Maples paints a picture of the Conservative leader holed up in his \"bunker\" at central office, surrounded by inexperienced junior officials but \"almost completely cut off\" from his own shadow cabinet. Mr Maples, sacked by Mr Hague as shadow foreign secretary in a reshuffle two weeks ago, warns of the \"danger\" that rightwingers are now shadowing most government departments, while moderates are in lower profile backroom jobs. And he reveals that, despite \"several attempts\", he never managed to have a serious discussion of foreign policy with his party leader, nor to convince him that Jeffrey Archer would \"get us into trouble\" as mayoral candidate. The critique, though presented as comradely advice from a colleague now \"outside the bunker\", amounts to one of the most outspoken assaults on Mr Hague's political judgment and leadership ability during his career as leader. Though the party leadership is certain to play down the remarks, contained in an open letter to Mr Hague in the Times, as the revenge of an embittered former front bencher, the criticism will be seen as reflecting unease among other moderates in the Conservative party. Some may feel the intervention - including a warning not to be seen as too anti-European - is particularly timely as Mr Hague today appears to pull his party towards a still tougher line on Europe, publishing five reasons to oppose the euro which indicate that the party will never join the single currency under his leadership. While Mr Maples did not shine in his foreign affairs brief, he is regarded as a grounded \"voice of reason\" in his party. His warning that Mr Hague has dragged his party too far to the right echoes similar claims made over Christmas by former prime minister John Major and Kenneth Clarke, and privately dismissed by senior party figures as the grumblings of yesterday's men. Mr Maples urges his party leader to \"use\" his shadow cainbet more. He writes: \"You have got some very bright people with real experience of government and policy both inside it and outside. Kids do not know everything and grey hairs have their part to play.\" Highlighting what he calls \"significant weaknesses\" in the Conservative central office \"war room\" operation, he warns: \"You have surrounded yourself with a private office which is almost completely cut off from the shadow cabinet and the parliamentary party. You have got the loyalty and commitment of your staff, but none of them has actually been a minister or responsible for policy.\" While the shadow cabinet has been \"extraordinarily well behaved\", some central office staff have \"constantly\" briefed the press against frontbenchers, he adds. On policy, Mr Maples endorses the party's Save the Pound message, but warns against any further talk of renegotiation of the European Union treaty rather than simply flexibility. \"Our policies and our tone must be mainstream and speak to the whole nation,\" he writes, stressing: \"We cannot win the election through private health insurance and being tough on asylum seekers\". Mr Hague, meanwhile, is still pinning his hopes on public opposition to the euro as a key plank of his election strategy. Launching the Tories' Save the Pound campaign at St Albans in Hertfordshire on his much-hyped customised truck, Mr Hague will issue reasons for keeping sterling in cluding higher taxes; a European superstate and a single European interest rate \"which will nearly always be wrong for us\". The pro-European pressure group Britain in Europe, which will hand out its own leaflets at today's rally, described the Tory leader's tour as a \"secondhand idea which fell of the back of a lorry\". Simon Buckby, the group's director, said: \"The van will embarrass the anti-Europeans and amuse the public wher ever it goes.\" The Conservatives' failure to be seen as a credible alternative to Labour is all the greater when the results of the Guardian ICM monthly \"euro\" referendum question are studied.

But when the off button is flicked, some of the gobbiness returns.</p> <p>\"That Hitler sounds dead dodgy,\" says Mark, 13, with a smirk.

Citizenship is Blunkett's baby. After the rosy glow of Labour's 1997 landslide turned a little pallid when a MORI poll revealed the lowest postwar electoral turnout, with a 43% abstention rate in the 18-24 age group, the Secretary of State turned to his old tutor, Bernard Crick, to dream up ways of reversing the tide of political indifference, illiteracy and cynicism. Crick hooked up with the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority and a few other interested schools and organisations to devise a gameplan, and late last year the National Curriculum for Citizenship was published. </p> <p>When the orders to make citizenship a statutory subject in 2002 were passed by parliament last Wednesday, Blunkett was in effusive, optimistic spirits. \"It is one of the most important steps in developing and understanding our democracy and encouraging active citizenship that has been introduced for a very long time,\" he said. \"I hope this will engage young people in their community and in their understanding of the subject.\" </p> <p>He went on to suggest that in those schools where citizenship was already being taught as part of personal and social education, attainment levels in other subjects had increased. One of the schools that Blunkett may have had in mind is Mill Chase Community School in Bordon, Hampshire, which he singled out as a shining example of best citizenship practice in a speech at the Institute of Education Citizenship Conference in July last year. </p> <p>Mill Chase Community School is a strange hybrid - a rural school with urban problems. The area is top-heavy with single-parent families, travellers and the military, there's no railway station, bus links are poor, there's no pub or cinema and there's a tangible sense of frustration and neglect. The school has a higher than average number of free school dinners and an A-C GCSE pass rate of 40%. </p> <p>Understandably the headteacher, Tony Philpott, isn't one for grandiose attainment statements; but he is more than happy to let me sit in on some citizenship lessons that he and PSE teacher Chris Waller were instrumental in introducing into the school in the early 1990s. </p> <p>\"Years 7, 8 and 9 get one hour of citizenship per week,\" says Waller, himself an adviser to the Crick report, \"and years 10 and 11 get two. We felt it was a really important way of getting the children to understand that they do have a voice and that their opinions can make a difference.\" So Waller has incorporated issues such as democracy, bullying, community action, xenophobia, racism, refugees and human rights into the personal and social education syllabus. </p> <p>Which is why year 9 are talking about the Holocaust. For some, the lesson is just an opportunity to switch off and chill out. Others struggle and fail to see the point. Ben sees it perfectly. \"It's a bit like Kosovo, isn't it?\" Leanne reckons it would be easier to get away with the Holocaust now because of nuclear weapons; Tanya reckons it would be harder because everyone could see what was going on. There's a similar range of ignorance and insight when the debate moves on to voting. John doesn't have a clue what you do, Nick reckons his mum and dad take a card to the newsagent, while Rebecca knows all about booths and ballot boxes. </p> <p>\"I'm introducing the children to some of the big questions,\" continues Waller, \" and getting them to see there may not be any obvious answers.\" Questions without answers is a mind-blowing concept for most children; it is also a mind-blowing concept for most educationalists, who like to measure everything in marks out of 100. And predictably, citizenship has drawn fire from many traditionalists who see citizenship as a return to the woolly liberalism of much of the teaching in the 1970s. </p> <p>Bizarrely, one of citizenship's fiercest critics turns out to be none other than that renowned 1970s reactionary, Ken Livingstone, who said on Radio 4's Question Time that \"it would be the most bunked-off subject on the school timetable\". </p> <p>Even though its advocates swear blind that citizenship is about the practicalities of life, the only practicalities that many schools are interested in are GCSE results. And although Blunkett has said that citizenship teaching will be assessed - though there are no details at present - unless a last-minute rabbit is produced out of the hat, there are going to be no league table ranking points at stake. So some schools, struggling to cram the latest literacy and numeracy initiatives into an already overcrowded timetable, may well see citizenship as an edict too far. </p> <p> Cynics suspect that some schools will subvert citizenship into extra history and politics lessons, and that for others it will be the graveyard shift for which teachers will need a machine gun to ensure attendance. It has even been suggested that some schools will fulfil their statutory hours by declaring one day a \"citizenship day\" in which everyone can run around like mad doing fantastically good works in the community for eight hours before reverting to their preferred, introverted, GCSE-obsessed state. </p> <p>Chris Waller is perfectly well aware of the potential for disaster, not least over the question of assessment. \"You can't have people failing citizenship,\" he says. \"So the only way you can measure what someone knows is by talking to them. And that is extremely time-consuming\". </p> <p>Waller is clearly prepared to invest the effort; his inference is that others will not be so willing. Indeed, one can't help feeling that citizenship teaching as a whole will stand or fall on the amount of enthusiasm and effort that schools are prepared to make. Mill Chase School has worked hard to ensure that citizenship is not a bolted-on adjunct to other curricular activities.</p> <p>\"I want the staff and students to realise there is a structure and to see where they are all heading,\" says Waller. \"So when they learn about the same issue in different classes, they don't just think this is daft and that the teachers don't talk to one another. The idea is to create a spiral of connected learning that feeds off itself. For instance, with human rights, the art and design teacher this year decided to do a project on freedom and captivity.\" </p> <p>Mill Chase School is not alone in good practice. The Institute for Citizenship has been working with 13 schools from Derby, Halton, Leicester and London to develop ways of delivering citizenship and some London schools are actively engaged on a Mayor for London project. The Citizenship Foundation has been working on a Primary Citizenship Project, developing stories for key stages 1 and 2 that explore themes of friendship, laws and rules, respecting differences, property and power and community and environment. Save the Children has given Roundhay School in Leeds an award for its work in the area. </p> <p>One doesn't want to knock this work, but there is a residual feeling of atavism. Of schools scrabbling around to find ways to incorporate citizenship into their curriculum, rather than a collective response to a central initiative. The finger inevitably points back to the Department for Education and Employment. The published national curriculum for citizenship looks very plush, but is actually rather vague. It is long on worthy statements about understanding rights and responsibilities and developing skills, but desperately short on how to implement them. </p> <p>Nor can we expect much more practical information. The QCA has just published schemes of work for history, geography, design and technology, ICT and science, which include areas that may be linked to citizenship, but there are no schemes of work for citizenship per se. Nor, we are told, are there plans for any. In other words, everyone will continue to make it up as they go along. </p> <p>As far as Mill Chase School is concerned, that means more of the same, with greater emphasis on advance planning so that every teacher knows what is going on elsewhere to deliver a holistic curriculum. It also means teaching by stealth; keeping the dreaded citizenship word, with its pious overtones, off the agenda. Part of Blunkett's vision is of a syllabus that includes voluntary work in the community, a concept that goes down like wet sick with many teenagers. The only trouble is that if you make voluntary work compulsory, then it's obviously not voluntary. I grab a group of year 11 pupils away from their PSE lesson on pressure groups and ask them about community work. \"It's boring and babyish,\" they chorus in unison. \"We did it at primary school but we wouldn't do it now.\" </p> <p>\"That's interesting,\" says Waller, a little later over a sandwich lunch, \"because in the last few years they were all involved in work outside the school. Some went to talk to other schools, they have written letters to the high commissioner to Malawi about conditions in a prison, others have written to Tony Blair about world debt, and some conducted an all-night vigil for Human Rights Day. It's how you sell the projects that counts. If they feel it is a continuation of what they are doing in school, it makes sense to them and they are happy to go along with it. If you just say, 'do some voluntary service,' they won't bother.\" </p> <p>Back in the year 11 PSE class, the work on pressure groups is scaled down from a general look at who holds what power to local interests. The skate park. Or the lack of it, to be precise. Waller suggests ways they could make a difference by getting involved with the local authority. He is met by faces of defeat. \"It's just not worth it,\" says Dazza. \"No one listens to us.\" </p> <p>Teaching citizenship is an uphill struggle. It's not like other subjects, which rely on the imparting of knowledge. To be effective, citizenship has to change attitudes, which is a much tougher call. Waller reckons it could take over 10 years to generate a feeling of empowerment amongst a generation of children who have grown up feeling life has little to offer them. I ask year 11 if they feel that anything they have learnt has changed a strongly held attitude. They think before replying. \"No, not really\". Eventually Scott chirps up, helpfully. \"I dunno,\" he says, \"I reckon I've become more tolerant of queers and lesbians.\" </p> <p>So what do they all think of citizenship? A few will admit to enjoying it and to it having made a difference. The reaction of most is that it's a bit of a doss, a second-class citizen, in effect, that is nowhere near as important as subjects such as maths, English and science. \"It's not going to help us get a job, is it?\" says Andrea, speaking for them all. </p> <p>\"Ah,\" says Waller, \"if it's such an unimportant subject, how come they all turn up? Their lessons are either just before lunch or just after - the ideal time to cut class. But they don't. My classes are better attended than many core subjects.\" </p> <p>Waller believes that if he can shift the attitudes of just two students he has been successful. If so, he may be able to find some victories in unlikely places. As I leave, Ashley, year 11's professional bad boy, chips in. \"You know, the teachers here are sexist,\" he says. \"If the girls get caught smoking or swearing they're always given a warning. I get into trouble just for saying shite\".</p>",

The QCA has just published schemes of work for history, geography, design and technology, ICT and science, which include areas that may be linked to citizenship, but there are no schemes of work for citizenship per se. Nor, we are told, are there plans for any. In other words, everyone will continue to make it up as they go along. As far as Mill Chase School is concerned, that means more of the same, with greater emphasis on advance planning so that every teacher knows what is going on elsewhere to deliver a holistic curriculum. It also means teaching by stealth; keeping the dreaded citizenship word, with its pious overtones, off the agenda. Part of Blunkett's vision is of a syllabus that includes voluntary work in the community, a concept that goes down like wet sick with many teenagers. The only trouble is that if you make voluntary work compulsory, then it's obviously not voluntary. I grab a group of year 11 pupils away from their PSE lesson on pressure groups and ask them about community work. \"It's boring and babyish,\" they chorus in unison. \"We did it at primary school but we wouldn't do it now.\" \"That's interesting,\" says Waller, a little later over a sandwich lunch, \"because in the last few years they were all involved in work outside the school. Some went to talk to other schools, they have written letters to the high commissioner to Malawi about conditions in a prison, others have written to Tony Blair about world debt, and some conducted an all-night vigil for Human Rights Day. It's how you sell the projects that counts. If they feel it is a continuation of what they are doing in school, it makes sense to them and they are happy to go along with it. If you just say, 'do some voluntary service,' they won't bother.\" Back in the year 11 PSE class, the work on pressure groups is scaled down from a general look at who holds what power to local interests. The skate park. Or the lack of it, to be precise. Waller suggests ways they could make a difference by getting involved with the local authority. He is met by faces of defeat. \"It's just not worth it,\" says Dazza. \"No one listens to us.\" Teaching citizenship is an uphill struggle. It's not like other subjects, which rely on the imparting of knowledge. To be effective, citizenship has to change attitudes, which is a much tougher call. Waller reckons it could take over 10 years to generate a feeling of empowerment amongst a generation of children who have grown up feeling life has little to offer them. I ask year 11 if they feel that anything they have learnt has changed a strongly held attitude. They think before replying. \"No, not really\". Eventually Scott chirps up, helpfully. \"I dunno,\" he says, \"I reckon I've become more tolerant of queers and lesbians.\" So what do they all think of citizenship? A few will admit to enjoying it and to it having made a difference. The reaction of most is that it's a bit of a doss, a second-class citizen, in effect, that is nowhere near as important as subjects such as maths, English and science. \"It's not going to help us get a job, is it?\" says Andrea, speaking for them all. \"Ah,\" says Waller, \"if it's such an unimportant subject, how come they all turn up? Their lessons are either just before lunch or just after - the ideal time to cut class. But they don't. My classes are better attended than many core subjects.\" Waller believes that if he can shift the attitudes of just two students he has been successful. If so, he may be able to find some victories in unlikely places. As I leave, Ashley, year 11's professional bad boy, chips in. \"You know, the teachers here are sexist,\" he says. \"If the girls get caught smoking or swearing they're always given a warning. I get into trouble just for saying shite\".",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>After long years of rejection and straitened budgets, happy days are here again for researchers in the social sciences. In Whitehall corridors the buzz is \"evidence\". In the Cabinet Office the Social Exclusion Unit and the Performance and Innovation Unit have proved to be avid consumers of academic work. Social scientists are regular visitors to Gordon Brown's policy seminars at Number 11. </p> <p>The government seems determined to ensure that social research fits with its policy priorities, especially in education. There, ministers and their special advisers seem to have been convinced by criticism levelled by Professors David Hargreaves of Cambridge and James Tooley of Newcastle University at academic colleagues for failing to address such practical questions as how children might perform better in the classrooms. </p> <p>To secure more knowledge, money is flowing out to economists, sociologists and those in related disciplines working in the universities and research units. The Department for Education and Employment is doubling its research budget; the Home Office's crime reduction programme includes \u00a325m for research and evaluation; health is spending \u00a330m on policy research while the annual budget of the arm's length Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) will increase from \u00a370m to \u00a373m by 2001-2002. </p> <p>But government largesse does not come cost-free. And the nature of the bargain Whitehall is offering was spelled out recently by education secretary David Blunkett. He said policy is better if informed by empirical evidence. \"Too often in the past, policy has not been informed by good research,\" said Blunkett. \"A former permanent secretary once ruefully described the old department of education and science as a \"knowledge free-zone\". </p> <p>\"Too many academics want to address issues other than those that are central and directly relevant to the political and policy debate.\" </p> <p>They focus on questions that fail to take reality into account. Sometimes, he said, research is \"setting out with the sole aim of collecting evidence that will prove a policy wrong rather than genuinely seeking to evaluate or interpret impact\". </p> <p>Blunkett is not alone. Lord (David) Lipsey was speaking for the New Labour establishment when he told a recent meeting of the Association of Research Centres in the Social Sciences that academics had to try harder to communicate their work to the wider public, who paid for it. </p> <p>Lord Sainsbury, the science minister, is conducting a review of how well public money spent on science gets translated into commercial opportunity as part of the treasury's year 2000 comprehensive spending review. There will be renewed determination to make sure the research council consults \"users\" in business and government before it allocates research contracts. </p> <p>But academic social scientists don't accept their primary purpose is to service Whitehall. Gordon Marshall, the Oxford sociologist and new head of the research council, has said only work of the highest intellectual quality will get funded. </p> <p>Janet Lewis, research director at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which commissions a large-scale programme of work from universi ties, worries that \"evidence led\" may mean \"what we want for our own political purposes\". </p> <p>With the Higher Education Funding Councils and the ESRC, Blunkett's department is putting \u00a312.5m into a five-year teaching and learning initiative. Sir Michael Peckham from the school of public policy at University College, London, is chairing a new national educational research forum \"to achieve greater coherence and agreement between funders, researchers and users of research\". </p> <p>The idea is that academics and policy-makers share knowledge faster - and improve consensus on what is important.

      "bodyText": "After long years of rejection and straitened budgets, happy days are here again for researchers in the social sciences. In Whitehall corridors the buzz is \"evidence\". In the Cabinet Office the Social Exclusion Unit and the Performance and Innovation Unit have proved to be avid consumers of academic work. Social scientists are regular visitors to Gordon Brown's policy seminars at Number 11. The government seems determined to ensure that social research fits with its policy priorities, especially in education. There, ministers and their special advisers seem to have been convinced by criticism levelled by Professors David Hargreaves of Cambridge and James Tooley of Newcastle University at academic colleagues for failing to address such practical questions as how children might perform better in the classrooms. To secure more knowledge, money is flowing out to economists, sociologists and those in related disciplines working in the universities and research units. The Department for Education and Employment is doubling its research budget; the Home Office's crime reduction programme includes \u00a325m for research and evaluation; health is spending \u00a330m on policy research while the annual budget of the arm's length Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) will increase from \u00a370m to \u00a373m by 2001-2002. But government largesse does not come cost-free. And the nature of the bargain Whitehall is offering was spelled out recently by education secretary David Blunkett. He said policy is better if informed by empirical evidence. \"Too often in the past, policy has not been informed by good research,\" said Blunkett. \"A former permanent secretary once ruefully described the old department of education and science as a \"knowledge free-zone\". \"Too many academics want to address issues other than those that are central and directly relevant to the political and policy debate.\" They focus on questions that fail to take reality into account. Sometimes, he said, research is \"setting out with the sole aim of collecting evidence that will prove a policy wrong rather than genuinely seeking to evaluate or interpret impact\". Blunkett is not alone. Lord (David) Lipsey was speaking for the New Labour establishment when he told a recent meeting of the Association of Research Centres in the Social Sciences that academics had to try harder to communicate their work to the wider public, who paid for it. Lord Sainsbury, the science minister, is conducting a review of how well public money spent on science gets translated into commercial opportunity as part of the treasury's year 2000 comprehensive spending review. There will be renewed determination to make sure the research council consults \"users\" in business and government before it allocates research contracts. But academic social scientists don't accept their primary purpose is to service Whitehall. Gordon Marshall, the Oxford sociologist and new head of the research council, has said only work of the highest intellectual quality will get funded. Janet Lewis, research director at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which commissions a large-scale programme of work from universi ties, worries that \"evidence led\" may mean \"what we want for our own political purposes\". With the Higher Education Funding Councils and the ESRC, Blunkett's department is putting \u00a312.5m into a five-year teaching and learning initiative. Sir Michael Peckham from the school of public policy at University College, London, is chairing a new national educational research forum \"to achieve greater coherence and agreement between funders, researchers and users of research\". The idea is that academics and policy-makers share knowledge faster - and improve consensus on what is important. Malcolm Wicks, minister for continuing education is chairing a series of seminars where researchers can put their ideas directly to David Blunkett, Sir Michael Bichard, the permanent secretary and their colleagues. The research preferred by government involves longitudinal studies - moving pictures of how people's lives and livelihoods change, eg how children with special educational needs fare through their final years of schooling into the world of work, training and further study. To ensure it gets what it wants Whitehall is setting up six dedicated centres within the universities, including the London School of Economics and Birkbeck College and a new Centre for Evidence Informed Policy and Practice at the Institute of Education. This is meant to collect together examples of \"what works\" among policy recommendations and ensure the message is conveyed to ministers. The research council is also putting \u00a33m into a new initiative \"to improve the knowledge base for policy and practice\". What was that old adage about pipers and tunes?",

      "body": "<p>Ralph Tabberer is just three days into his new job as chief executive of the Teacher Training Agency, and he has already made his mark. While his predecessor, Anthea Millett, was no great fan of grey boxes, his personal computer and laptop - which he considers essential tools of the trade - are up and running in his 13th-floor office in Victoria, London. Within the agency itself, his colleagues welcome the prospect of a wind of change. </p> <p>The fortysomething former humanities teacher, local education authority adviser and \"classroom researcher\" (his own rather modest description) has moved just down the road from the Department for Education and Employment, where he worked as a civil servant from 1997, initially as a senior adviser in Michael Barber's Standards and Effectiveness Unit and most recently heading the National Grid for Learning division. </p> <p>Tabberer has landed arguably one of the most important jobs in education, leading a high-profile drive to recruit teachers as the profession faces the biggest modernisation programme in its history. But he is under no illusion that ministers, teaching unions and providers - ie the teacher training colleges - expect the agency to become one of the most successful graduate recruitment bodies, in competition with industry. And he is also well aware of the strong personal interest of the prime minister, who even appeared in the first phase of the \u00a31.5m national recruitment campaign alongside one of his former teachers. </p> <p>\"The most important thing is that we get involved in promoting the profession, while making sure that we are one of the most effective graduate recruiters, on a par with the banks and big businesses,\" Tabberer says. \"We have got to be that good\". </p> <p>Strong partnership with teacher training colleges is also key to the drive to raise standards, by offering top quality courses. Interestingly, he sees the slimming down of the role of the agency - the result of a government review into the agency's first five years - as a positive development rather than a setback.</p> <p>Last spring, education secretary David Blunkett rejected calls for the agency to be scrapped at the end of the review, despite strong criticism over its failure to meet government recruitment targets. But he decreed that if the agency was to remain, it would have a reduced remit allowing it to concentrate only on key areas. Now, as Tabberer explains, the agency's responsibility is to oversee the recruitment and training of teachers, up to the point when they arrive in the classroom. Thereafter, the fledgling General Teaching Council will take over as the voice for the profession, once teachers have registered with it. \"The whole organisation is now much more focused,\" he explains. </p> <p>Inevitably, his first week was packed with meetings with ministers and other senior education figures. But while Tabberer expects to spend the first weeks of his new job simply listening, a priority is to listen to new entrants to the profession - young entrants as well as older \"returners\" - in order to find out about their expectations. As he puts it himself: \"If I can get a sense of the voice of teachers, and find out if we are delivering what they want, that will be a good starting point.\" He has also promised a root-and-branch review of the organisation itself, examining every process it carries out, although top quality research will be key to its work. </p> <p>Despite the continued public perception of a so-called recruitment crisis, Tabberer believes the corner has been turned, and points out that inquiries from potential trainees have leaped by 30% as a result of the advertising campaign. Recent research shows - surprisingly - that teaching is the fourth most popular option for graduates after broadcast and media, marketing and public relations, and communications. The profession also continues to attract around 30,000 new trainees every year. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the national vacancy rate continues to hover at around 0.7%, with proportionately even more jobs unfilled in London. And there remain serious shortages in some subjects, despite the introduction of the \"golden hello\" incentive scheme for graduates in maths, science and languages. Another depressing trend is the huge number of trainees who never set foot in the classroom, or who quit soon after qualifying. </p> <p>All these conflicting signals suggest the need for a definitive picture of recruitment and supply. School standards minister Estelle Morris has asked Tabberer for a detailed report by Easter, which will be critical to the next phase of implementing the reforms in the Green Paper. </p> <p>Inevitably, pay has dominated much of the recent debate, and the government has tried to counter concerns about poor remuneration with the introduction of performance-related pay, which will provide significant rewards for talented teachers who qualify to pass through the \"threshold\". But Tabberer believes pay must be considered within the broader context of professional development. \"Research shows that what graduates want are 'prospects', which includes the chance to progress within a clearly defined framework,\" he says. He is also keen to allay the National Union of Teachers' worries about forthcoming numeracy, literacy and ICT (information and communications technology) tests, which he believe will help teachers to do their jobs better. </p> <p>Aware of the need to meet tough targets to attract more male, ethnic minority and disabled teachers, Tabberer would like to see more classroom-based initiatives to emphasise the attractiveness of teaching early on. \"We need to make more of the fact that we have a captive audience, with every youngster spending around 15,000 hours in the classroom between the age of five and 16,\" he says. </p> <p> One possibility, he explains, might be getting older children to try their hand at the front of the class. He described how as a sixth-former he stepped in to teach a class American politics, and experienced the buzz and thrill of being at the front of the class. Keen to stamp out the myth that teaching is unexciting or \"cissy\", he says: \"There is absolutely nothing cissy about teaching. All those of us who have taught know it is challenging and exciting and an incredibly responsible job. For me it is also a great passion.\" </p> <p>That first taste of teaching as a Plymouth schoolboy led him, after Cambridge, to a postgraduate certificate in education at Brunel University, and thence to the classroom as a humanities teacher. He then moved into research with the National Foundation for Educational Research. He believe his own career shows how teaching can lead to other interesting education jobs that may not necessarily be classroom-based. </p> <p>Barriers need to be broken down, he says, and older entrants need to be encouraged. Similarly, there is no reason why younger teachers should not move on after, say, 10 years. \"We have to recognise that the whole nature of work and careers is changing beyond recognition,\" he stresses. He quotes, for example, the influx into the jobs market of around 3,000 BT workers, whose skills would be invaluable for teaching design and technology and ICT. The next phase of the advertising campaign, which will be rolled out over the coming weeks, will emphasise the many skills involved in teaching. </p> <p>Education department colleagues who have worked with Tabberer describe him as thoughtful and hard-working, passionate about ICT and \"a bit off the wall, not your typical civil servant,\" according to one.

      "body": "<p>The government is refusing to boost college governors' legal protection from being sued for all they possess if their institutions hit the skids and they are held to blame. </p> <p>Baroness Blackstone, the further education minister, has rejected a call from colleges for a clause in the Learning and Skills Bill guaranteeing their governors safety from being held personally liable, provided they acted in good faith. </p> <p>She says governors are \"protected by existing law against any risk to their own assets\" so long as they are honest and show common sense. </p> <p>But existing law is inadequate and the lack of proper safeguards can only exacerbate a current serious shortage of volunteers to become governors, according to the Association of Colleges.

      "bodyText": "The government is refusing to boost college governors' legal protection from being sued for all they possess if their institutions hit the skids and they are held to blame. Baroness Blackstone, the further education minister, has rejected a call from colleges for a clause in the Learning and Skills Bill guaranteeing their governors safety from being held personally liable, provided they acted in good faith. She says governors are \"protected by existing law against any risk to their own assets\" so long as they are honest and show common sense. But existing law is inadequate and the lack of proper safeguards can only exacerbate a current serious shortage of volunteers to become governors, according to the Association of Colleges. The association is calling for college governors to get the same statutory protection as is enjoyed by school governors, company directors and charitable trustees. In January it wrote to the minister reminding her that a study commissioned two years ago by the Committee on Standards in Public Life established that there was a need for legislation to ensure equal legal protection for all appointees to responsible bodies of \"public service organisations\" (PSOs). The study concluded that this safeguard should be equivalent to that bestowed by the 1925 Trustee Act and the 1985 Companies Act on charitable trustees and on company directors. This gives courts discretion to grant relief on those individuals who have acted honestly and reasonably but nonetheless find themselves facing potential liability. The 1998 study - Personal Liability in Public Service Organisations -looked at the position of college governors among other people serving PSOs.

I do not believe that is the answer.

      "body": "<p>Could do better. Despite considerable government investment and commitment to information and communications technology over the past few years, Ofsted's conclusion is that ICT teaching across the country is still patchy and uneven.</p> <p>It's a verdict confirmed by Becta, the government's ICT and education agency. According to its schools director, Niel McLean, there are two populations - those schools that know what to do with ICT and those that don't: \"It's not so much that they do it badly as they don't do it at all. It's as stark as that.\" </p> <p>While at one time many schools could plead lack of funding as the reason for their prevarication, that excuse is nearing the end of its shelf life. The government has now stumped up a total of \u00a31.7bn in funding for equipment and teacher training. \"We wouldn't be spending money like that if everything was hunky dory,\" admits McLean. </p> <p>Certainly Willow Tree Primary in Ealing has benefited from the extra cash. Getting ICT right comes down to money, believes headteacher Deryn Harvey. \"Three years ago we were faced with real budgetary constraints. I had a lot of vision for ICT but my hands were tied because I had no spare money for hardware.\" </p> <p>Since then she has tapped into NGfL and industry support and leapt ahead - her teachers have their own training suite, pupils have two machines in every classroom and there's an interactive whiteboard for every lesson. \"To do well you do need to keep your eyes open for funding, keeping in contact with the right organisations, and the local authority,\" she concludes. </p> <p>But how much is enough? Geoff Brookes, deputy headteacher with responsibility for the curriculum at Easingwold School, a comprehensive with 1,200 pupils in North Yorkshire, is trapped with outmoded hardware. \"One problem is that we've been locked into the BBC and Archimedes computers. Like many schools, we were geared up to using these machines and their software; they were very good, but PCs became the common currency and it costs an awful lot to change over.\" </p> <p>His school is in the second phase of NGfL funding and has not yet received cabling. \"Although we're very grateful for what we're getting, funding is still a key issue because the technology is still so expensive. For \u00a3500, for instance, you can buy 50 textbooks, but only one PC. There's never enough to do everything you want to do - if there were, we could all provide excellent resources for both pupils and staff.\" </p> <p>Money is not the only issue. Even those schools that have won Ofsted's praise for their ICT teaching acknowledge the difficulty facing others. Three years ago Ofsted criticised Ifield Special School in Kent for not making enough use of its technology - more recently Ofsted described it as outstanding. </p> <p>\"No matter how much money you throw at it, it takes a long time to get the structure in place, and then you need time to consolidate it,\" says headteacher Simon Harrison. And getting it right means getting everyone on board, he believes. \"Ultimately it depends on the commitment of the head and the entrepreneurial enthusiasm of the staff. If they are computer literate and committed then the school can develop things and move forward very quickly, looking for cost-effective and creative solutions for developing ICT further.\" </p> <p>Keith Parry, director of ICT at Hyde Technology School in Tameside, also believes the solution is to win over hearts and minds. \"ICT here is not just a separate subject but something used by all our departments. Each has its own computer suites and facilities to manage and control,\" he explains. </p> <p>\"It's important that ICT is seen as a strategic issue for the whole school, as something underpinning the whole curriculum to improve teaching across the board. Only then will it be seen as an area for strong investment and commitment, and a lot of the perceived problems will simply melt away.\" </p> <p> But therein lies the rub, according to Tony Poulter, ICT co-ordinator at Hugo Meynell CofE Primary in Shropshire, which has had ICT highlighted as an area of strength by Ofsted. \"Some teachers are resistant to ICT even now. It probably comes down to unwillingness to change, fear of technology, or being threatened by the fact that the children are so red hot on it. Older teachers winding down a career may think they don't have to get to grips with it. </p> <p>\"While the extra training is a step forward, it's not compulsory and there's no accreditation at the end of it. It's a question of how you make some people actually switch on the computer in the first place, let alone use it effectively in the classroom.\" </p> <p>But many teachers may simply need time to catch their breath, argues Geoff Turrell, headteacher at St Peter's CofE Junior School in Birmingham, also rated by Ofsted as exemplary. \"For some schools the introduction of the numeracy and literacy strategies has put ICT on a backburner, and there has been no clear support for using ICT in these contexts. The government is now sending out the right signals that ICT has to be a priority.\" </p> <p>His advice to struggling schools is to carry out an audit of teacher confidence in ICT. \"You can then link that with training opportunities and ensure a good match between the two.\" And as schools feel more confident, they need to set themselves a challenge. \"Pick an area like video-conferencing where you can become really leading edge, and that confidence will trickle down into all sorts of areas.\" </p> <p>One area that needs attention is content, says Kevin Satchwell, headteacher at Thomas Telford School in Shropshire, a technology college which has developed its own online curriculum: \"If you haven't got exciting, stimulating material you're stuck, because if it doesn't impact upon the quality and standard of teaching and learning, what's the point?\" </p> <p>While there are lots of good CD-roms and websites, these need to be gathered and cross-referenced to the curriculum for easy access and use, and teachers haven't got time to develop their own software or surf the web, he argues. \"Getting the content right is a bigger challenge than putting cabling in. What we need is a whole series of exemplary curriculum for ICT that teachers can pick and mix from.\" </p> <p>McLean agrees: \"The trouble is we've turned it into too big a challenge for many teachers. Telling them they need to rethink their approach is not that good a message.\" </p> <p>But at least most now recognise ICT as an issue that has to be addressed. \"There's been a number of passing fads over the past 20 years and it can be tricky working out which are here to stay,\" he says. \"But this one is not going away.\"</p>",

If telly cameras in the kitchen put people off the catering profession, the vignettes shown of bouncers' work could well deter most people. </p> <p>For the last few years, councils up and down the country have been setting up registration schemes for door staff, to weed out the problem thug. This has, in many areas, been supplemented with compulsory training covering the law, licensing, basic first aid, drugs awareness and people control. </p> <p>The work has led to a newly announced British Standard for door staff and two awarding bodies offering national certificates and even the possibility of an NVQ (National Vocational Qualification). </p> <p>Here in Carlisle the local bouncers were extremely sceptical of people being able to teach them anything, but, slowly, a rapport has been built between the doorman, the council and the local police. To such a point that they now find that there are certain local characters they would rather not work with. </p> <p>The New Year's Eve after our first course, the Carlisle Police reported there wasn't any trouble in any club in Carlisle - what an achievement! </p> <p>The local doormen, and let's not forget the increasing number of women, are well aware that they have a dangerous and unenviable job - acting as support for the police, making sure that the general public have a good and safe time, but, at the same time, having only a split second to make the right decision. </p> <p>We are living in an increasingly violent world, the old style fisticuffs will no longer do. The public is often going out on drink and drugs. Full of aggression. Sometimes armed. </p> <p>To cope with this, not only doormen, but all people dealing with the public - witness recent events at a hospital where a nurse was attacked - are having to learn a whole range of complex aggression control and people management skills and how to put them into effect very rapidly. </p> <p>Look at the work of the Suzy Lamplugh trust in raising the profile of this problem. This is not a job for the stereotype bouncer, but for someone who is skilled. </p> <p>Let's hope that television and the critics have done nothing to spoil this perception. There are another five weeks of the series to go. </p> <p>Spare a thought for the poor person working on the door tonight.</p> <p>\u0095 Norman Gentry is the course organiser for the door supervisor programme at Carlisle College and a freelance consultant.</p>",

      "bodyText": "For years we have been trying to improve the image of our occupation, which is currently featuring on a late night BBC series. If telly cameras in the kitchen put people off the catering profession, the vignettes shown of bouncers' work could well deter most people. For the last few years, councils up and down the country have been setting up registration schemes for door staff, to weed out the problem thug. This has, in many areas, been supplemented with compulsory training covering the law, licensing, basic first aid, drugs awareness and people control. The work has led to a newly announced British Standard for door staff and two awarding bodies offering national certificates and even the possibility of an NVQ (National Vocational Qualification). Here in Carlisle the local bouncers were extremely sceptical of people being able to teach them anything, but, slowly, a rapport has been built between the doorman, the council and the local police. To such a point that they now find that there are certain local characters they would rather not work with. The New Year's Eve after our first course, the Carlisle Police reported there wasn't any trouble in any club in Carlisle - what an achievement! The local doormen, and let's not forget the increasing number of women, are well aware that they have a dangerous and unenviable job - acting as support for the police, making sure that the general public have a good and safe time, but, at the same time, having only a split second to make the right decision. We are living in an increasingly violent world, the old style fisticuffs will no longer do. The public is often going out on drink and drugs. Full of aggression. Sometimes armed. To cope with this, not only doormen, but all people dealing with the public - witness recent events at a hospital where a nurse was attacked - are having to learn a whole range of complex aggression control and people management skills and how to put them into effect very rapidly. Look at the work of the Suzy Lamplugh trust in raising the profile of this problem. This is not a job for the stereotype bouncer, but for someone who is skilled. Let's hope that television and the critics have done nothing to spoil this perception. There are another five weeks of the series to go. Spare a thought for the poor person working on the door tonight. \u0095 Norman Gentry is the course organiser for the door supervisor programme at Carlisle College and a freelance consultant.",

      "bodyText": "Thirteen men appeared in court yesterday accused of seizing the Boeing 727 at the centre of the Stansted airport hijack drama, while 73 of the freed passengers voluntarily returned to Aghanistan, apparently calling Britain a damp and \"infidel\" nation. The accused men, all Afghan nationals aged between 18 and 36, appeared at Southend magistrates court and were charged under section one of the Aviation Security Act 1982. The charge said that \"within the jurisdiction of the central criminal court they unlawfully and by use of force or threat seized aircraft Boeing 727 YA-FAY and its passengers\". In an hour-long hearing they appeared in three separate groups, all bearded and wearing 1970s-style prison-issue track suits in navy, marine blue or green, and slippers. At least one man was said to have a wife and child on board the plane, and all are believed to be seeking political asylum. The men, including two sets of brothers, heard the proceedings through Farsi and Pashtoo interpreters, although some of the accused answered \"yes\" in English to the magistrate. None applied for bail. The stipendiary magistrate Kevin Gray remanded the 13 in custody and adjourned the committal proceedings until March 13 at 9.45am. Earlier yesterday, half of the freed Afghan hostages, trapped in the aircraft from February 6-10, landed at Afghanistan's spiritual capital Kandahar, and spoke of their ordeal and of \"infidel\" Britain. Despite stopping at the Stansted Hilton, one said: \"It is not a Muslim country, how could we stay? The weather was depressing and the food was awful.\" Mohammed Latif Nasri, a ground engineer who was on board the plane, added: \"They requested that they stay in the United Kingdom. That was their only demand.\" Another said: \"They have nothing to do with politics.\" The Taliban foreign minister, Wakil Ahmad Mutawakil, looked embarrassed as he met the freed hostages at Kandahar airport. He has sought to play down the idea that those on the plane were trying to escape the Taliban's strict Islamic government. The defendants appearing at Southend were named as Muhammad Sediqui, 36; Abdul Showaib, 20; Mohammad Safi, 32; Ali Safi, 34; Mohammad Sediqui, 30; Khalil Ullah, 30; Muhammad Kazem, 27; Waheed Lufti, 22; Reshad Ahmodi, 18; Nazamuddin Mohammidy, 26; Mohammed Showaib, 25; Taimur Shah, 28; and Ghayur Abdul, 24. The charged men were represented in court by three barristers and six solicitors. Kenneth Carr, acting for two of the defendants but supported by all counsel, made an application in camera for the men's names to be withheld from publication under section 11 of the Contempt of Court Act. After hearing arguments for about two hours, the magistrate rejected the request. The men are understood to fear that their families in Afghanistan will be persecuted by the Taliban once their names are made public.

It got enough votes in a fair election to become a player in a coalition government. Why not wait until the Freedom party does something intolerable, before making its mere presence in the government of Austria a cause for ostracism? When the Austrian foreign minister met her peer-group in Brussels yesterday she was, at least, listened to. Having made their point, perhaps European leaders are prepared to put her on parole.</p> <p>But the British were slow off the mark. For two days, they appeared more fastidious towards Austrian voters than European values. Though Robin Cook gets irritable with anyone who asks him questions about this, and has now placed himself in the European mainstream, the early hesitation was noted. It was specifically British - and in the wrong sense. Here is a case where, if one looks at the Haider problem in the round, this country has the opportunity, indeed duty, not to be a reluctant follower but a certain kind of leader.</p> <p>This is not the obvious place from which to take J\u00f6rg Haider seriously, or understand why others do so. For Britain is not threatened by a party like Haider's. To many Brits, the reaction against him looks like another example of the EU over-reaching in pursuit of dubious uniformity. Who will be next, even respectable BBC voices inquire, in the Euro-purge of political incorrectness? Might Portillo follow, where Haider fell?</p> <p>But to Belgium, Haider is a real and immediate threat. The Flemish separatist party, Vlaams Blok, pursues the same racist, anti-immigrant agenda as the Austrian Freedom party, but has so far been studiously excluded from power both in the nation and the cities. The VB is homing in on Antwerp in October's municipal elections, having been kept out for six years by a coalition of the orthodox left and right. In other words, neo-fascism - and there's no doubt that the Haider programme, however smarmily dressed up, deserves the epithet - is seen in Belgium for what it is, and the other parties have treated it as the prime enemy against which they must organise their country's politics.</p> <p>Another place where Haiderism is more than academic is France. In the 1998 elections, the National Front made gains which put it in line for a role in coalitions. In three of the 22 regions, it is part of government, thanks to breakaway centre-rightists. But the official parties of the right have denounced the NF unequivocally. President Chirac's RPR forbade any coalitions, and the UDF did the same. Like Vlaams Blok, the Front attacks immigrants and favours blood-purity tests for family allowances, along with a host of other extreme racist positions. Both parties take jubilant comfort in the legitimation J\u00f6rg Haider has received from the Austrian political establishment. So it is as much to defend their own political stability as to advance pan-Europeanism that France and Belgium are trying to fix a cordon sanitaire around him. For them this is no small or theoretical question.</p> <p>Having a different history and different politics, Britain has different preoccupations. Yet we face similar social issues, in particular migration in all its forms. The seeds of Haider's appeal lie in the stoked-up fears he excites about Austria's identity and Austrians' jobs being destroyed by foreigners. It's a potent line, difficult to contest at the same demagogic level. But the same line is now being pumped out in Britain. The country happens to have the opportunity to test its vaunted political system against the weakness that allowed the Blok, the Front and Herr Haider to advance.</p> <p>We can see Haideresque language in the reaction of many British newspapers to the Afghan asylum hijacking. There are the same metaphors of swamping, the same recklessness with facts, the same populist terror, the same impression of a country that's a soft touch for invaders of every bloodsucking kind: Austria from its exposed borders, Britain from its allegedly lenient immigration laws. The world, we've been told for a week, is full of hijackers with immigrant cargo and a global intelligence service homing in on Stansted. Where will it all end, unless Jack Straw makes good his promise to send every manjack of them home to Afghanistan?</p> <p>These are not easy decisions for the British government. Hijacking cannot be allowed to become the new weapon of asylum-busting. On the other hand, we have international obligations, and a plain moral duty not simply to return, unverified, every unwilling Afghan citizen to the brutal mercies of the Taliban. If asylum has serious origins, Afghanistan is prominent among them, as is shown by its position at the top of the global list of regimes people are trying to get away from, and the fact that of 805 applications from Afghanis in Britain adjudicated in the first half of 1999, 800 were accepted.</p> <p>As Straw addresses the choices, however, it's becoming more common to hear Haiderism brought into play.

      "bodyText": "The demonising of J\u00f6rg Haider is something the British find hard to understand. He leads, after all, a democratic party. It got enough votes in a fair election to become a player in a coalition government. Why not wait until the Freedom party does something intolerable, before making its mere presence in the government of Austria a cause for ostracism? When the Austrian foreign minister met her peer-group in Brussels yesterday she was, at least, listened to. Having made their point, perhaps European leaders are prepared to put her on parole. But the British were slow off the mark. For two days, they appeared more fastidious towards Austrian voters than European values. Though Robin Cook gets irritable with anyone who asks him questions about this, and has now placed himself in the European mainstream, the early hesitation was noted. It was specifically British - and in the wrong sense. Here is a case where, if one looks at the Haider problem in the round, this country has the opportunity, indeed duty, not to be a reluctant follower but a certain kind of leader. This is not the obvious place from which to take J\u00f6rg Haider seriously, or understand why others do so. For Britain is not threatened by a party like Haider's. To many Brits, the reaction against him looks like another example of the EU over-reaching in pursuit of dubious uniformity. Who will be next, even respectable BBC voices inquire, in the Euro-purge of political incorrectness? Might Portillo follow, where Haider fell? But to Belgium, Haider is a real and immediate threat. The Flemish separatist party, Vlaams Blok, pursues the same racist, anti-immigrant agenda as the Austrian Freedom party, but has so far been studiously excluded from power both in the nation and the cities. The VB is homing in on Antwerp in October's municipal elections, having been kept out for six years by a coalition of the orthodox left and right. In other words, neo-fascism - and there's no doubt that the Haider programme, however smarmily dressed up, deserves the epithet - is seen in Belgium for what it is, and the other parties have treated it as the prime enemy against which they must organise their country's politics. Another place where Haiderism is more than academic is France. In the 1998 elections, the National Front made gains which put it in line for a role in coalitions. In three of the 22 regions, it is part of government, thanks to breakaway centre-rightists. But the official parties of the right have denounced the NF unequivocally. President Chirac's RPR forbade any coalitions, and the UDF did the same. Like Vlaams Blok, the Front attacks immigrants and favours blood-purity tests for family allowances, along with a host of other extreme racist positions. Both parties take jubilant comfort in the legitimation J\u00f6rg Haider has received from the Austrian political establishment. So it is as much to defend their own political stability as to advance pan-Europeanism that France and Belgium are trying to fix a cordon sanitaire around him. For them this is no small or theoretical question. Having a different history and different politics, Britain has different preoccupations. Yet we face similar social issues, in particular migration in all its forms. The seeds of Haider's appeal lie in the stoked-up fears he excites about Austria's identity and Austrians' jobs being destroyed by foreigners. It's a potent line, difficult to contest at the same demagogic level. But the same line is now being pumped out in Britain. The country happens to have the opportunity to test its vaunted political system against the weakness that allowed the Blok, the Front and Herr Haider to advance. We can see Haideresque language in the reaction of many British newspapers to the Afghan asylum hijacking. There are the same metaphors of swamping, the same recklessness with facts, the same populist terror, the same impression of a country that's a soft touch for invaders of every bloodsucking kind: Austria from its exposed borders, Britain from its allegedly lenient immigration laws. The world, we've been told for a week, is full of hijackers with immigrant cargo and a global intelligence service homing in on Stansted. Where will it all end, unless Jack Straw makes good his promise to send every manjack of them home to Afghanistan? These are not easy decisions for the British government. Hijacking cannot be allowed to become the new weapon of asylum-busting. On the other hand, we have international obligations, and a plain moral duty not simply to return, unverified, every unwilling Afghan citizen to the brutal mercies of the Taliban. If asylum has serious origins, Afghanistan is prominent among them, as is shown by its position at the top of the global list of regimes people are trying to get away from, and the fact that of 805 applications from Afghanis in Britain adjudicated in the first half of 1999, 800 were accepted. As Straw addresses the choices, however, it's becoming more common to hear Haiderism brought into play. On this view, Haider is a caution to us all, and the best way to avoid the contagion is for Britain to toughen is own immigration and asylum regime. Such is the high moral ground on which our domestic xenophobia can be heard coming to rest. To draw a line in the channel, beyond which neo-fascism shall not pass, it's the solemn task of government to harden its line against refugees and send them back the other way. If this turns out to be the lesson Britain takes from Haider, it will be a shameful one. It's not only inhumane, it would repudiate the kind of lead that Britain is uniquely placed to give.

A clear profile of the Kremlin's new Harry Lime is unlikely to emerge until well after he takes power. Which worries the manhole-watchers no end.</p> <p>A few facts are known. V. Putin, born 1952, studies law in Leningrad, joins the KGB in the early '70s. He spends several years in Erich Honecker's East Germany where his job, reportedly, is to recruit and run agents against the west. Later he becomes an \"aide\" to Anatoly Sobchak, pro-Yeltsin mayor of St Petersburg. In foreign intelligence for 17 years, he rises to the modest rank of lieutenant-colonel. Even during the 1991 coup attempt and the turbulent early post-Soviet years, he makes no unambiguous political commitments. He remains a backroom boy, an undercover man. In the mid-'90s, he disappears altogether. And then something surprising happens. Emerging on the Kremlin's security staff, he suddenly pops up - those manhole covers again - as boss of the FSB (the reorganised KGB) in 1998. In August, 1999, he is Mr Yeltsin's dark-horse choice as prime minister. Then comes the biggest shock of all. Less than six months later, Mr Yeltsin quits early and mysteriously, and he is named acting president and heir apparent. Russians and Russia-watchers unite in asking: how could this happen? Surely, it is argued, his ruthless prosecution of the Chechnya war cannot alone explain this extraordinary rise. The key question, covertly asked, is no longer \"who is Vladimir Putin?\" but rather \"what does Vladimir Putin know?\"</p> <p>From his earliest KGB days, Mr Putin's job seems to have involved spying on his own side as much as on the west. In Dresden, according to published accounts, he worked with Honecker's Stasi in keeping tabs on reformers. In 1987 the East German security apparatus awarded him a medal of thanks. After the wall fell, Mr Putin followed the tide but appears to have maintained close ties to the security services (which he had ostensibly left around 1991). As in the past, his strengths seem to be toughness, discretion and, like Yuri Andropov before him, his sources of information. As a failing Mr Yeltsin lost his grip amid damaging disclosures of financial scandal, the knowledgeable, perhaps all-knowing, Mr Putin finally took over the front office. Perhaps he was invited; perhaps he could no longer be resisted.</p> <p>In recently published comments, Mr Putin declined to condemn the role of the NKVD, a KGB forerunner, in Stalin's 1937 purges. \"One must not keep pretending that that we do not need state security bodies,\" he went on. \"One needs to understand what makes them work against their own people.\" He seems to understand only too well. Sinister questions about Mr Putin will persist. But the interim sit-rep for western spooks is: Do not under-estimate; treat with great care.</p>",

A clear profile of the Kremlin's new Harry Lime is unlikely to emerge until well after he takes power. Which worries the manhole-watchers no end. A few facts are known. V. Putin, born 1952, studies law in Leningrad, joins the KGB in the early '70s. He spends several years in Erich Honecker's East Germany where his job, reportedly, is to recruit and run agents against the west. Later he becomes an \"aide\" to Anatoly Sobchak, pro-Yeltsin mayor of St Petersburg. In foreign intelligence for 17 years, he rises to the modest rank of lieutenant-colonel. Even during the 1991 coup attempt and the turbulent early post-Soviet years, he makes no unambiguous political commitments. He remains a backroom boy, an undercover man. In the mid-'90s, he disappears altogether. And then something surprising happens. Emerging on the Kremlin's security staff, he suddenly pops up - those manhole covers again - as boss of the FSB (the reorganised KGB) in 1998. In August, 1999, he is Mr Yeltsin's dark-horse choice as prime minister. Then comes the biggest shock of all. Less than six months later, Mr Yeltsin quits early and mysteriously, and he is named acting president and heir apparent. Russians and Russia-watchers unite in asking: how could this happen? Surely, it is argued, his ruthless prosecution of the Chechnya war cannot alone explain this extraordinary rise. The key question, covertly asked, is no longer \"who is Vladimir Putin?\" but rather \"what does Vladimir Putin know?\" From his earliest KGB days, Mr Putin's job seems to have involved spying on his own side as much as on the west. In Dresden, according to published accounts, he worked with Honecker's Stasi in keeping tabs on reformers. In 1987 the East German security apparatus awarded him a medal of thanks. After the wall fell, Mr Putin followed the tide but appears to have maintained close ties to the security services (which he had ostensibly left around 1991). As in the past, his strengths seem to be toughness, discretion and, like Yuri Andropov before him, his sources of information. As a failing Mr Yeltsin lost his grip amid damaging disclosures of financial scandal, the knowledgeable, perhaps all-knowing, Mr Putin finally took over the front office. Perhaps he was invited; perhaps he could no longer be resisted. In recently published comments, Mr Putin declined to condemn the role of the NKVD, a KGB forerunner, in Stalin's 1937 purges. \"One must not keep pretending that that we do not need state security bodies,\" he went on. \"One needs to understand what makes them work against their own people.\" He seems to understand only too well. Sinister questions about Mr Putin will persist. But the interim sit-rep for western spooks is: Do not under-estimate; treat with great care.",

      "bodyText": "A housing survey undertaken for John Prescott's department of the environment is set to strongly challenge the prime minister's claim that the north-south divide is a myth. The findings of the largest survey of housing demand undertaken in England will confirm the existence of a poor north and an increasingly wealthy south. A week ago Tony Blair angered councillors at Labour's local government conference by attacking leftwingers peddling the \"myth\" of a prosperous south and a poor north. \"It's not true, and it is a false illusion that the answer to the problems of the north is somehow to punish the south,\" he said. But the report, produced by housing and planning specialists from Edinburgh's Heriot-Watt university, finds inescapable evidence of a widening gulf. After examining the housing market throughout the coun try for over a year, it says: \"Low demand (for houses) is concentrated in northern England and the contrast between north and south has increased over the recent period.\" It says two thirds of an estimated 380,000 council homes blighted by low demand are in the north, while there is little evidence of a similar problem in the south. The report draws a distinction between low demand for housing and unpopular neighbourhoods, which can occur in London where demand for low cost housing outstrips supply. Claims of a widening north-south divide, which Downing Street sought to rubbish in a recent report produced for Mr Blair by the cabinet office, will clearly embarrass the prime minister. With northern backbenchers increasingly uneasy over falling support in the party's core areas, the prime minister last week accused his critics of promoting division and setting north against south. One official close to the report challenged a central assertion of the prime minister that divisions within regions themselves were wider than any north-south split. \"While that might be true on one level, there are hardly any areas in the south where there is a significant level of low demand for public housing - or abandoned private houses on the scale of the north,\" he said. \"Inescapably, there is a big problem in the north, fuelled by unemployment and people moving away.\" Labour backbenchers close to Downing Street appear increasingly concerned that the prime minister's rhetoric is not matched by the reality on the ground. In a new study flagging up Labour's achievements in the north-east, the Blairite MP for Houghton and Washington, Fraser Kemp, underlines the north-south divide. He points to lower levels of wealth - and says northern household income is the lowest in the UK and unemployment the highest.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Rupert Murdoch yesterday moved to counter critics who have complained that News Corp has been too slow in embracing new media. Like Bill Gates at Microsoft, Mr Murdoch has found himself outpaced by younger, more nimble rivals who have been quicker to capitalise on the potentially vast opportunity of the internet. Like Mr Gates, News Corp has taken on the appearance of a company desperately hedging its bets by making investments and striking deals wherever it can because the two moguls who were once regarded as visionaries appear to have no real idea of what happens next. </p> <p>The decision to pool News Corp's satellite television businesses into a single company certainly gives the appearance that Mr Murdoch is thinking bigger and has started by leveraging some of the group's assets. </p> <p>The argument is that with a single business News Corp would be better placed to build on its international network by doing deals with internet service and content providers that were born thinking global. </p> <p>Ploughing cash into websites which use existing media brands is the accepted way of old media firms to adopt the new - often without any sense of when they will make any money. This latest move from News Corp gives it control of a potentially lucrative infrastructure for other internet providers to exploit - or thinking bigger without much risk. </p> <p>Interestingly, Mr Murdoch's big idea draws on the ideas of two inspirational and far-sighted individuals. </p> <p>The first is science fiction writer Arthur C Clarke, who has long figured in the thinking of the media mogul. It was Mr Clarke who popularised the notion of a global information network created by a world encircled by satellites. The other is Netscape's Jim Clark, who talked of interactive TV as being the way to get into everybody's living room. Time Warner, one of Mr Murdoch's rivals, spent a fortune trying to make the system work. It failed. Mr Murdoch has been warned. </p> <p><strong> Wake-up.call </strong><br> </p> <p> Everything about Finelist says heartlands. The midlands-based company is involved in parts distribution for the auto industry, about as traditional as you can get. It is involved in a real business involving real products and employs real people. By any yardstick a firm that employs 7,000 and has a turnover of \u00a3400m is an outfit to be reckoned with, and in normal circumstances you would expect that a publicly quoted company like Finelist would attract plenty of interest among investors in the City when it expressed a desire to expand into Europe. </p> <p>But these are not normal circumstances. Companies which sell motor exhausts and clutches are of little interest to investors obsessed only with the latest internet flotation. As such, Finelist is to be swallowed up by French rival Autodistribution in a private venture capital deal. </p> <p>Like many other better known companies, from British Airways to Marks &amp; Spencer, Finelist found that its paper simply was not in demand. It was trading at five times earnings at a time when most of the internet start-ups would be on a price to earnings ratio of around 1000:1 - assuming that they actually had any earnings in the first place. </p> <p>What is happening, both in the City and on Wall Street, is the development of a two tier market, with a handful of internet stocks doing amazingly well and the rest languishing in the doldrums. For much of the stock market, this is already a bear market and has been for some time.

      "bodyText": "Rupert Murdoch yesterday moved to counter critics who have complained that News Corp has been too slow in embracing new media. Like Bill Gates at Microsoft, Mr Murdoch has found himself outpaced by younger, more nimble rivals who have been quicker to capitalise on the potentially vast opportunity of the internet. Like Mr Gates, News Corp has taken on the appearance of a company desperately hedging its bets by making investments and striking deals wherever it can because the two moguls who were once regarded as visionaries appear to have no real idea of what happens next. The decision to pool News Corp's satellite television businesses into a single company certainly gives the appearance that Mr Murdoch is thinking bigger and has started by leveraging some of the group's assets. The argument is that with a single business News Corp would be better placed to build on its international network by doing deals with internet service and content providers that were born thinking global. Ploughing cash into websites which use existing media brands is the accepted way of old media firms to adopt the new - often without any sense of when they will make any money. This latest move from News Corp gives it control of a potentially lucrative infrastructure for other internet providers to exploit - or thinking bigger without much risk. Interestingly, Mr Murdoch's big idea draws on the ideas of two inspirational and far-sighted individuals. The first is science fiction writer Arthur C Clarke, who has long figured in the thinking of the media mogul. It was Mr Clarke who popularised the notion of a global information network created by a world encircled by satellites. The other is Netscape's Jim Clark, who talked of interactive TV as being the way to get into everybody's living room. Time Warner, one of Mr Murdoch's rivals, spent a fortune trying to make the system work. It failed. Mr Murdoch has been warned. Wake-up.call Everything about Finelist says heartlands. The midlands-based company is involved in parts distribution for the auto industry, about as traditional as you can get. It is involved in a real business involving real products and employs real people. By any yardstick a firm that employs 7,000 and has a turnover of \u00a3400m is an outfit to be reckoned with, and in normal circumstances you would expect that a publicly quoted company like Finelist would attract plenty of interest among investors in the City when it expressed a desire to expand into Europe. But these are not normal circumstances. Companies which sell motor exhausts and clutches are of little interest to investors obsessed only with the latest internet flotation. As such, Finelist is to be swallowed up by French rival Autodistribution in a private venture capital deal. Like many other better known companies, from British Airways to Marks &amp; Spencer, Finelist found that its paper simply was not in demand. It was trading at five times earnings at a time when most of the internet start-ups would be on a price to earnings ratio of around 1000:1 - assuming that they actually had any earnings in the first place. What is happening, both in the City and on Wall Street, is the development of a two tier market, with a handful of internet stocks doing amazingly well and the rest languishing in the doldrums. For much of the stock market, this is already a bear market and has been for some time. The FTSE 100 was off another 2% yesterday. E-commerce is undoubtedly an important business development, but some of the stock market valuations placed on the dot.com tigers only appear to be sustainable if all 58m of us are to spend 24 hours a day for the rest of our lives surfing the internet and buying books, insurance, air fares and last minute Valentine's day bouquets. Looking at the stock market it is hard to avoid arriving at the conclusion that investors are gripped by a collective speculative madness which will end in tears when the high-flyers crash into a reality checkpoint. One look at the balance sheet of Amazon.com - where cash and securities were more than four times current liabilities in June last year but less than current liabilities by December - is an indication of how hard it is going to be for many of the darlings of the stock market to turn good ideas into profits. It may be tempting for the cheerleaders of the new economy to assume that we will spend all our money with lastminute.com.

      "body": "<p>Oasis, Blur, Pearl Jam and Sheryl Crow will all vouch for the ability of Borderline, a small basement club in London's Soho, to give the careers of aspiring rock bands a kick-start. </p> <p>Tonight four teenagers from Derby who make up the punk band Stumble hope to emulate them by taking to the stage in front of an audience heavily populated with record industry executives to perform their catchily named single \"How many times do I have to kill you before I die?\" </p> <p>The budding guitar-wreckers' chance has come not because they have been grinding their way around the regional circuit of pubs and clubs but because of their popularity on the internet. Over the past six months Stumble has consistently been one of the most listened to bands on <a href=\"[http://www.peoplesound.com/home_index.htm]\">Peoplesound.com</a>, a website that allows users to listen to and download music for free. </p> <p>Peoplesound.com showcases 3,500 unsigned artists on its site, attracting 60,000 regis tered users and 750,000 visits a month. Surfers use MP3 technology to download the music, a phenomenon which many in the record industry believe will soon make compact discs obsolete. </p> <p>Ernesto Schmitt, Peoplesound's president and founder, claims that sites such as his could revolutionise the way new bands are signed and listened to. The music industry writes off $5bn (\u00a33.1bn) in unrecoverable investment each year mainly because 95% of debut albums fail, according <a href=\"[http://www.bcg.com/homepage/default.asp]\">Boston Consulting Group </a>research. </p> <p>Mr Schmitt believes that the user data Peoplesound generate could significantly reduce that wastage. \"A&amp;R men have an unenviable job trying to choose which bands are going to be a commercial success,\" he said. \"Traditionally they have relied on gut feeling but through Peoplesound an artist's popularity relative to their peer group, the demographics and geographic location of the listeners can all be measured at the click of a button. We hope to become the <a href=\"[http://acnielsen.com/]\">AC Nielsen</a> [television ratings organisation] of the record industry.\" </p> <p>Mr Schmitt hopes that major labels will soon use Peoplesound to test market bands for which they have high hopes. \"After a month or so on the site the label will have a fairly clear idea what sort and how many people the artist will appeal to. Then they can decide whether to invest in them. It will be like a nursery school for artists.\" </p> <p>Peoplesound is not alone in offering new artists exposure to a global audience on the internet. <a href=\"[http://www.mp3.com/]\">MP3.com</a> in the United States is the world's largest site with 50,000 artists. Web music, MP3, is so popular that it has overtaken sex as the most commonly entered internet search term. </p> <p>Peoplesound is Europe's largest site showcasing unsigned talent and is three times bigger than its nearest rival Vitaminic, Mr Schmitt claims. <a href=\"[http://www.musicunsigned.com/]\">Musicunsigned.com</a> and <a href=\"[http://www.popwire.com/]\">Popwire.com</a> are smaller rivals. </p> <p>Mr Schmitt says Peoplesound differentiates itself by filtering out poor quality artist submissions before they are posted on-line. \"We get rid of the crap early on. Some sites will post recordings of kids singing in the bath but we have a dedicated team of ex-A&amp;R men deciding which artists will make it onto Peoplesound. </p> <p>\"Songs are categorised by genre but we also have a facility whereby the user can enter the names of the bands he or she likes and we will point them in the direction of acts with similar style and sounds.\" </p> <p>Peoplesound has a number of different revenue streams. Providing consumer research data to major labels is potentially one of the most lucrative. The same demographic-rich research can be offered to advertisers. Sales of compilation albums which users put together themselves also account for a significant proportion of revenues. </p> <p>LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault's internet investment group Europe@web has backed Peoplesound to succeed and Mr Schmitt is looking for strategic investment from some of the Europe's leading internet service providers. </p> <p>Though revenues are small at the moment and Mr Schmitt is working to make downloading music less confusing and time consuming for new internet users, it would be no surprise if Peoplesound floated in the summer. </p> <p>By then Stumble could be thrashing its way to the top of the charts.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Oasis, Blur, Pearl Jam and Sheryl Crow will all vouch for the ability of Borderline, a small basement club in London's Soho, to give the careers of aspiring rock bands a kick-start. Tonight four teenagers from Derby who make up the punk band Stumble hope to emulate them by taking to the stage in front of an audience heavily populated with record industry executives to perform their catchily named single \"How many times do I have to kill you before I die?\" The budding guitar-wreckers' chance has come not because they have been grinding their way around the regional circuit of pubs and clubs but because of their popularity on the internet. Over the past six months Stumble has consistently been one of the most listened to bands on Peoplesound.com, a website that allows users to listen to and download music for free. Peoplesound.com showcases 3,500 unsigned artists on its site, attracting 60,000 regis tered users and 750,000 visits a month. Surfers use MP3 technology to download the music, a phenomenon which many in the record industry believe will soon make compact discs obsolete. Ernesto Schmitt, Peoplesound's president and founder, claims that sites such as his could revolutionise the way new bands are signed and listened to. The music industry writes off $5bn (\u00a33.1bn) in unrecoverable investment each year mainly because 95% of debut albums fail, according Boston Consulting Group research. Mr Schmitt believes that the user data Peoplesound generate could significantly reduce that wastage. \"A&amp;R men have an unenviable job trying to choose which bands are going to be a commercial success,\" he said. \"Traditionally they have relied on gut feeling but through Peoplesound an artist's popularity relative to their peer group, the demographics and geographic location of the listeners can all be measured at the click of a button. We hope to become the AC Nielsen [television ratings organisation] of the record industry.\" Mr Schmitt hopes that major labels will soon use Peoplesound to test market bands for which they have high hopes. \"After a month or so on the site the label will have a fairly clear idea what sort and how many people the artist will appeal to. Then they can decide whether to invest in them. It will be like a nursery school for artists.\" Peoplesound is not alone in offering new artists exposure to a global audience on the internet. MP3.com in the United States is the world's largest site with 50,000 artists. Web music, MP3, is so popular that it has overtaken sex as the most commonly entered internet search term. Peoplesound is Europe's largest site showcasing unsigned talent and is three times bigger than its nearest rival Vitaminic, Mr Schmitt claims. Musicunsigned.com and Popwire.com are smaller rivals. Mr Schmitt says Peoplesound differentiates itself by filtering out poor quality artist submissions before they are posted on-line. \"We get rid of the crap early on. Some sites will post recordings of kids singing in the bath but we have a dedicated team of ex-A&amp;R men deciding which artists will make it onto Peoplesound. \"Songs are categorised by genre but we also have a facility whereby the user can enter the names of the bands he or she likes and we will point them in the direction of acts with similar style and sounds.\" Peoplesound has a number of different revenue streams. Providing consumer research data to major labels is potentially one of the most lucrative. The same demographic-rich research can be offered to advertisers. Sales of compilation albums which users put together themselves also account for a significant proportion of revenues. LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault's internet investment group Europe@web has backed Peoplesound to succeed and Mr Schmitt is looking for strategic investment from some of the Europe's leading internet service providers. Though revenues are small at the moment and Mr Schmitt is working to make downloading music less confusing and time consuming for new internet users, it would be no surprise if Peoplesound floated in the summer. By then Stumble could be thrashing its way to the top of the charts.",

      "body": "<p>A young woman whose cervical cancer was not spotted in spite of regular smear tests is facing a prolonged and expensive legal battle for compensation because of a dispute as to which of three NHS trusts and health authorities should pay up. </p> <p>Experts agree that Ruth Tudor was let down by the NHS cervical smear programme. Screeners failed to spot her cancer in 1989, 1991 and 1995. By the time her cancer was finally diagnosed, in 1998, when she was 35 and about to try for a baby, it was very serious. She had to undergo a radical hysterectomy which removed not only her womb but her ovaries. </p> <p>Forest Healthcare NHS trust has admitted liability for the third smear which was misreported by the cytology lab at Whipps Cross hospital in east London. But instead of agreeing to pay Ms Tudor's compensation, Forest is arguing that the lawyers must decide which of the three bodies responsible for the screening of Ms Tudor's smears - Forest, Redbridge and Waltham Forest health authority or St George's NHS Trust - should foot the bill. </p> <p>Ms Tudor says that whoever pays, the money will ultimately come from NHS funds, and legal wranglings over responsibilities between the separate firms of solicitors representing the different authorities will increase the bill to the taxpayer. </p> <p>Forest's case is that the damage had been done by the time its screeners wrongly reported the smear test in 1995 as clear, and that Ms Tudor would have had to have had a hysterectomy even if they had got it right. Its lawyers have told her solicitors that they should pursue Redbridge and Waltham Forest health authority, which was responsible for the lab that misreported the 1991 smear. </p> <p>Ms Tudor, a tax consultant, said: \"They are saying because I can't prove that the cancer wasn't invasive in 1991, it probably was invasive, so although they were negligent in 1995 I'd already suffered the damage so it isn't their problem.\" </p> <p>\"I decline their invitation to sue another health authority. If I was to do that, it not only leads to my costs increasing but to the legal costs the NHS will have to pay increasing.\" </p> <p>The expert employed by Forest to report on Ms Tudor's cancer, John Monaghan, a consultant gynaecological oncologist, says in his report that all three smears showed cancerous changes to the cervix. </p> <p>Ms Tudor said: \"I feel comprehensively let down.

      "bodyText": "A young woman whose cervical cancer was not spotted in spite of regular smear tests is facing a prolonged and expensive legal battle for compensation because of a dispute as to which of three NHS trusts and health authorities should pay up. Experts agree that Ruth Tudor was let down by the NHS cervical smear programme. Screeners failed to spot her cancer in 1989, 1991 and 1995. By the time her cancer was finally diagnosed, in 1998, when she was 35 and about to try for a baby, it was very serious. She had to undergo a radical hysterectomy which removed not only her womb but her ovaries. Forest Healthcare NHS trust has admitted liability for the third smear which was misreported by the cytology lab at Whipps Cross hospital in east London. But instead of agreeing to pay Ms Tudor's compensation, Forest is arguing that the lawyers must decide which of the three bodies responsible for the screening of Ms Tudor's smears - Forest, Redbridge and Waltham Forest health authority or St George's NHS Trust - should foot the bill. Ms Tudor says that whoever pays, the money will ultimately come from NHS funds, and legal wranglings over responsibilities between the separate firms of solicitors representing the different authorities will increase the bill to the taxpayer. Forest's case is that the damage had been done by the time its screeners wrongly reported the smear test in 1995 as clear, and that Ms Tudor would have had to have had a hysterectomy even if they had got it right. Its lawyers have told her solicitors that they should pursue Redbridge and Waltham Forest health authority, which was responsible for the lab that misreported the 1991 smear. Ms Tudor, a tax consultant, said: \"They are saying because I can't prove that the cancer wasn't invasive in 1991, it probably was invasive, so although they were negligent in 1995 I'd already suffered the damage so it isn't their problem.\" \"I decline their invitation to sue another health authority. If I was to do that, it not only leads to my costs increasing but to the legal costs the NHS will have to pay increasing.\" The expert employed by Forest to report on Ms Tudor's cancer, John Monaghan, a consultant gynaecological oncologist, says in his report that all three smears showed cancerous changes to the cervix. Ms Tudor said: \"I feel comprehensively let down. I feel cheated because what's hap pening now is that we are being told cervical cancer screening is not 100% reliable. They are saying that we always knew that. But they are re-writing the past.\" She says that suing the NHS as a taxpayer feels like \"robbing Peter to pay Paul\", but she is doing it because \"money talks\". The NHS needs to see there is a cost attached to negligence, she says. A spokesman for Forest Healthcare trust said they admitted negligence on the 1995 smear but confirmed they were looking at the role of the other authorities. \"The trust has made an admission of a breach of duty regarding the smear in 1995 but as there could be other defendants, we have to await the advice of the NHS litigation authority.\" The worst of several scandals over the misreporting of cervical smears by cytology labs was at Kent and Canterbury hospital in the early 1990s. At least eight women died and 30 underwent major surgery because cell changes were not spotted. Sarah Harman, the solicitor for the Kent and Canterbury victims who is representing Ms Tudor, says it took Forest at least 16 months to admit liability and is impatient at the further delay.",

The question is why. Abortion has never decided the outcome of a primary vote or a federal election. A recent poll found only 14% of Americans want abortion banned. So why the great debate?</p> <p>\"Abortion has become the new litmus test for presidential candidates,\" explains New York political columnist Danielle Crittenden. \"If you declare yourself pro-life, what it means is you are solid on social conservative issues, you respect the family - all these issues the pro-life movement has tied to the abortion issue. And if you declare yourself pro-choice, you are saying you are sound on women's issues. Abortion has become symbolic beyond the actual procedure.

It was the women's vote that put Bill Clinton into office - twice - and all the candidates need women at the polls. So the conservatives are appealing to pro-life women and the democrats are appealing to pro-choice women, hoping the single issue will draw them out on primary day.\"</p> <p>Wolfe says it certainly will draw pro-choice women to the ballot box because the next president will in all likelihood appoint up to five new judges to the Supreme Court (a number are due to retire). \"Pro-choice women are taking this primary season very seriously because there is a real danger that Roe vs Wade [the 1973 decision legalising abortion] could be reversed if pro-life judges are appointed.\"</p> <p>The fact that abortion has come to dominate this primary campaign might have caught some off-guard, but seasoned campaign watchers say they saw it coming. In 1992, after the Supreme court reaffirmed Roe vs Wade, pro-life Republicans, the majority of whom live in the Bible Belt, demanded that their party beef up its commitment to overturning abortion rights.</p> <p>By 1996, the pro-life wing had organised in an attempt to influence the election agenda.

The real problem for Republican candidates in South Carolina on Saturday will be pulling off the trick of appealing to hardcore right-to-lifers who swing primary votes, without alienating voters, the majority of whom are pro-choice, come November.</p> <p>For John McCain, who in 86 votes in Congress voted 82 times against any abortion funding, this dilemma is acute. Despite his voting record, he now declares himself a pro-lifer who would not, however, overturn Roe vs Wade, because \"outlawing abortion would drive women to illegal and dangerous operations\".</p> <p>While dismissed as a sellout by the extreme rightwing, McCain's blatant attempt to appeal to pro-choice conservative and independent women worked.

Bradley, who has so far suffered defeats in Iowa, New Hampshire and Delaware, is trailing with female voters and the pressure to lure them and keep his candidacy alive is intense. As he and Gore differ on so little else, Bradley has settled on abortion to sabotage Gore's nomination chances. Seizing on Gore's voting record during 1977-1984, when he opposed federal funding for abortions, and an old letter in which Gore said: \"Abortion is arguably the taking of a human life,\" Bradley has hammered the vice president in South Carolina, damaging his credibility with pro-choice women.</p> <p>Gore, who says he would \"no longer use that phrasing today\", is furious that Bradley is insinuating that he is simply trawling for votes. \"For far too long, some politicians have been willing to play with the issue of choice for their own personal political ambition,\" Gore said last week at a fund-raiser organised by women activists. \"So I say to Senator Bradley, stop trying to divide us on the issue of choice. It's time to join hands and fight the real enemy in the Republican party.\" But Bradley, having found Gore's weak spot, just keeps pressing it.</p> <p>\"The struggle between Bradley and Gore is ridiculous because they are both as pro-choice as politicians get,\" Wolfe says. \"The good thing is that, come November, this issue will not loom so large because we will have one clear pro-choice and one pro-life candidate, and they can move on to other issues.\"</p> <p>On Saturday, South Carolinians will decide whether they want Bush or McCain to be their next president. While McCain is being touted to women as the lesser of two evils in the abortion debate, Wolfe is not so sure. \"What would be worse for women, McCain or Bush? The answer is both of them.

An article attacking the moderate gay rights campaigner Angela Mason is thought to have been the deciding factor, and last week the contract was awarded to the publishers of Gay Times. </p> <p>At the weekend the weekly gay Pink Paper attacked Associated for \"hypocrisy\" in discussing the deal while its flagship paper was taking such an anti-gay line. </p> <p>Associated said yesterday its contract publishing division, which would have produced the magazine and two \"gay pride\" editions of the London Evening Standard's Hot Tickets listings, was separate from its newspapers. </p> <p>It pointed out that the Mail and the Standard had taken different editorial stances on section 28. </p> <p>The Mail denies that its campaign is homophobic. Matt Wells</p> <p><b>Pub design panel finds little cheer</b></p> <p>For the 14th time in the past 15 years, the judges in the Camra real ale pub design awards have failed to find any new pub to which they could bear to award a prize. </p> <p>The prize had never been presented until the Wharf, the ultra modern pub beside Walsall's new art gallery, took the honour last year. </p> <p>The judges say the upheaval in recent years, with thousands of pubs changing hands as small traditional pub groups were snapped up by the brewery giants, has led to the construction of fewer new pubs of real design quality. </p> <p>The judges were equally depressed by the upkeep of venerable pubs: the English Heritage conservation award will not be presented either. \"Many of the 1999 entries seemed to equate the concept of conservation with wholesale gutting and the reinvention of history,\" said Steve Parissien, chairman of the judging panel. </p> <p>The JD Wetherspoon chain will score a first by having two of its pubs jointly win the pub conversion prize: the Half Moon, a former fringe theatre at Mile End in east London, which was itself originally converted from a derelict chapel, and the Billiard Hall, in West Bromwich, which was originally an exuberant art nouveau billiard and snooker hall. </p> <p>\"We're delighted with ourselves,\" spokesman Eddie Gershon said. \"We've got a bit of a love-hate relationship with Camra.\" </p> <p>The judges praised the Half Moon as \"a most encouraging and impressive renewal of a building which three years ago seemed to have little future\", and admired the striking contrast in the Billiard Hall between the conservation of the exterior and the \"strikingly modern language\" of the interior. </p> <p>Cains brewery will take the best pub refurbishment award for the Dispensary in Liverpool which the judges said had \"an appalling local reputation\" before the Victorian restoration. </p> <p><b>Rally victim wanted to be a driver</b></p> <p>The young spectator killed in a rallying tragedy at the weekend was described yesterday as a \"most lovely boy\", who had cheered and waved as his father sped past only moments before another driver went out of control and somersaulted his car into a knot of onlookers. </p> <p>Marc Taylor, 11, was itching to be a \"real rally driver like his dad\", according to his primary school headteacher. </p> <p>An off-duty policeman was credited with saving the life of Marc's eight-year-old cousin Christopher Hymers. He gave first aid to Christopher, who had stopped breathing, until paramedics arrived. </p> <p>Christopher, from Winlaton, Gateshead, remained on the critical list yesterday with severe head and internal injuries, along with his father Ian, 39, who has broken ribs, and his grandfather, also Ian, 60, who suffered head injuries. Two other spectators were recovering from less serious injuries. </p> <p>Police are studying amateur video of the tragedy at the annual Apex Cheviot rally on Otterburn army ranges in Northumbria. The driver of the car, Alyn Stockton of Oulston, near Chester-le-Street, county Durham, is to be interviewed by police. </p> <p>Colin Wilson, of rallying's governing body, the Motor Sports Association, said Mr Stockton had held a competitor's licence for five years.

But Mr Howarth said it was of such aesthetic value that time should be allowed for the painting to be saved for the nation. </p> <p>The small-scale canvas shows shows the goddess Diana stripping and denouncing her handmaiden Callisto, a luckless wench made pregnant by Jupiter, who came to her in the guise of Diana herself. </p> <p>Lemoyne, a favourite of Louis XV, was a key figure in the decoration of the palace at Versailles and taught Boucher. The only two other Lemoynes in the country are housed in the Wallace Collection, London: Perseus and Andromeda (1723), and Time Saving Truth from Falsehood and Envy (1737). The bar on export holds until August.</p>",

At the weekend the weekly gay Pink Paper attacked Associated for \"hypocrisy\" in discussing the deal while its flagship paper was taking such an anti-gay line. Associated said yesterday its contract publishing division, which would have produced the magazine and two \"gay pride\" editions of the London Evening Standard's Hot Tickets listings, was separate from its newspapers. It pointed out that the Mail and the Standard had taken different editorial stances on section 28. The Mail denies that its campaign is homophobic. Matt Wells Pub design panel finds little cheer For the 14th time in the past 15 years, the judges in the Camra real ale pub design awards have failed to find any new pub to which they could bear to award a prize. The prize had never been presented until the Wharf, the ultra modern pub beside Walsall's new art gallery, took the honour last year. The judges say the upheaval in recent years, with thousands of pubs changing hands as small traditional pub groups were snapped up by the brewery giants, has led to the construction of fewer new pubs of real design quality. The judges were equally depressed by the upkeep of venerable pubs: the English Heritage conservation award will not be presented either. \"Many of the 1999 entries seemed to equate the concept of conservation with wholesale gutting and the reinvention of history,\" said Steve Parissien, chairman of the judging panel. The JD Wetherspoon chain will score a first by having two of its pubs jointly win the pub conversion prize: the Half Moon, a former fringe theatre at Mile End in east London, which was itself originally converted from a derelict chapel, and the Billiard Hall, in West Bromwich, which was originally an exuberant art nouveau billiard and snooker hall. \"We're delighted with ourselves,\" spokesman Eddie Gershon said. \"We've got a bit of a love-hate relationship with Camra.\" The judges praised the Half Moon as \"a most encouraging and impressive renewal of a building which three years ago seemed to have little future\", and admired the striking contrast in the Billiard Hall between the conservation of the exterior and the \"strikingly modern language\" of the interior. Cains brewery will take the best pub refurbishment award for the Dispensary in Liverpool which the judges said had \"an appalling local reputation\" before the Victorian restoration. Rally victim wanted to be a driver The young spectator killed in a rallying tragedy at the weekend was described yesterday as a \"most lovely boy\", who had cheered and waved as his father sped past only moments before another driver went out of control and somersaulted his car into a knot of onlookers. Marc Taylor, 11, was itching to be a \"real rally driver like his dad\", according to his primary school headteacher. An off-duty policeman was credited with saving the life of Marc's eight-year-old cousin Christopher Hymers. He gave first aid to Christopher, who had stopped breathing, until paramedics arrived. Christopher, from Winlaton, Gateshead, remained on the critical list yesterday with severe head and internal injuries, along with his father Ian, 39, who has broken ribs, and his grandfather, also Ian, 60, who suffered head injuries. Two other spectators were recovering from less serious injuries. Police are studying amateur video of the tragedy at the annual Apex Cheviot rally on Otterburn army ranges in Northumbria. The driver of the car, Alyn Stockton of Oulston, near Chester-le-Street, county Durham, is to be interviewed by police. Colin Wilson, of rallying's governing body, the Motor Sports Association, said Mr Stockton had held a competitor's licence for five years. Martin Wainwright Sale halted by bar on export of old master The arts minister Alan Howarth yesterday stepped in to stop an erotically charged old master painting from leaving the country, writes Fiachra Gibbons. Fran\u00e7ois Lemoyne's Diana and Callisto, a work that hits three perennial raw nerves at once - sex, hypocrisy and the plight of single mothers - has been sold to an unnamed foreign buyer for \u00a31.6m. But Mr Howarth said it was of such aesthetic value that time should be allowed for the painting to be saved for the nation. The small-scale canvas shows shows the goddess Diana stripping and denouncing her handmaiden Callisto, a luckless wench made pregnant by Jupiter, who came to her in the guise of Diana herself. Lemoyne, a favourite of Louis XV, was a key figure in the decoration of the palace at Versailles and taught Boucher. The only two other Lemoynes in the country are housed in the Wallace Collection, London: Perseus and Andromeda (1723), and Time Saving Truth from Falsehood and Envy (1737). The bar on export holds until August.",

Colin Whittall, 35, from Oxford, was featured on the motoring show in August 1996 with his Dash Master device - a hand-held computer which enabled car mileage to be clocked by changing the odometer reading. He claimed it could alter readings on expensive cars including BMWs, Jaguars and Mercedes. The programme was seen by trading standards officials in Shrewsbury who decided to prosecute Whittall. They raided his company in Telford, Shropshire, but could only find leaflets advertising the Dash Master, which costs between \u00a3450 and \u00a3750. Whittall pleaded guilty at Shrewsbury crown court to inciting the public to commit offences under the trade descriptions act and an offence of evading a liability by deception. Sentencing him, Judge Michael Mander described the Dash Master as a diabolical device which was plainly intended to incite customers to behave illegally. \"Clocking cars is an enormous evil,\" he said. \"One of its consequences is to deprive decent, honest, hardworking people from money they can ill afford. \"If you or anyone else thinks that this court will deal with this offence with anything other than a custodial sentence, you are not living in the real world.\" He ordered Whittall to pay \u00a36,000 costs.

Ms Rose, an accounts clerk, met Mr Wilson in their home town of Sale, Greater Manchester, when she was 15 and he was 17. Three years later he gave her a ring, and in 1994 they had a large white wedding. Conubial bliss began to fade as soon as the confetti had been thrown. \"I suppose things were okay for six months,\" said Mr Wilson, \"but we just got married too young. It's quite sad really, but I feel ecstatic today.\" Ms Rose believed that they should have lived together longer to learn about each other. \"I decided to enter the competition but never thought we'd get anywhere,\" she said. \"I thought it would be a giggle.\" The pair beat off strong competition by a couple from Gorton in Manchester: the wife complained her husband had a habit of putting on his underpants inside-out so that he could get a second day's wear. A station spokesman denied any bad taste. \"Divorce is a reality,\" he said. \"We are just trying to help one couple get on with the rest of their lives.\"",

Sylvia Paterson, 54, complained that her husband, Kenneth, handed over a controlling interest in his metal business to his son Paul without informing her. She also blamed her stepson and his wife, Sarah, for a deterioration in her own marriage, Anthony Gee QC, prosecuting, told Manchester crown court. Paterson, of Wilmslow, Cheshire, is accused of conspiring with John Holmes, 43, a businessman friend, to murder Paul and Sarah Paterson last April. The prosecution claims that they hired Paul Thurslog, a criminal who also worked as a clown called Banjo, as a hitman. The price agreed was \u00a320,000 for Paul and \u00a320,000 for Sarah. Paterson and Holmes deny conspiracy to murder and Holmes denies a further charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice. Mr Gee said Paterson wanted her stepson and his wife, who have two young children, killed when they were celebrating their wedding anniversary. Paterson allegedly told Thurslog that her stepson had caused a lot of problems and that she wanted him and his wife to go missing. \"Their bodies would never be found and after seven years they would be declared dead and the business would go back to Kenneth,\" Mr Gee said. \"The motive lying behind the conspiracy appears to have been spite or a desire for revenge with the hope of possible financial benefit on the part of Sylvia Paterson.

Since the church's funding crisis eight years ago when commissioners lost more than \u00a3500m through ill-judged property speculation in an attempt to fund clergy wages and pensions, shortfalls in funding for ordinands have been met from central reserves. The report warns that reserves are now down to \u00a31m - the equivalent of six weeks' expenditure - and that other means must be found to pay for fluctuations in student numbers. There are currently about 1,450 ordinands in training at 11 colleges, producing 320 stipendiary and 200 non-stipendiary candidates for ordination each year. About three-quarters of the church's \u00a38.5m annual training budget goes in course fees with most of the remainder allocated in allowances.

Mr Brown is fond of quoting the precise increases in weekly incomes for those benefiting from the minimum wage, the WFTC and the new 10p starting rate of income tax. Critics Critics of the chancellor argue that it was a betrayal of Labour principles to rule out an increase in both the basic and top rates of tax during this parliament. Mr Brown and his advisers say that even without putting up income tax, they still have another 200 or so revenue raising options at their disposal. The rich may still be paying marginal tax at 40%, but they have been hit in other ways. After 20 years in which the tax system became more regressive, the main beneficiaries of Labour's tax changes have been those at the bottom. It is Mr Brown's record of delivering with his nitty-gritty policies that has left his stock high, both inside and outside the party. When William Hague appointed Michael Portillo to be the opposition treasury spokesman, the spin from central office was that the Conservatives needed their top gun to match the government's heaviest hitter. Yet Mr Portillo arrives at an awkward time for his party. There will be more money for the poor in the budget, more money for schools and hospitals in the summer. Economy The economy has performed well since the election; whatever other problems the prime minister has, they do not include rising unemployment, soaring inflation, a collapsing pound or the arrival in Britain of planeloads of hard men from the International Monetary Fund.",

Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, who will formally present the government's position to MPs, said in Brussels last night that Britain's priority was to secure a change in voting weights in the council of ministers when the EU expands to take in up to 13 extra members. \"Without these treaty changes it will be very difficult to proceed with enlargement,\" Mr Cook warned.

As part of an overall package of reforms, he will also agree to give up one of Britain's two commissioners - currently Neil Kinnock and Chris Patten. Britain enters these talks - formally an intergovernmental conference (IGC) - more in tune with its EU partners than ever before, though with the crucial exception of its lukewarm attitude towards the single currency. But it can still expect some hard bargaining from those who seek to remove the national veto over some tax issues. There is also pressure from the European commission president, Romano Prodi, to erode the number of issues on which a unanimous vote is required. Whitehall is also worried about calls for flexibility, which would allow more integrationist countries to forge ahead with policies of their choice, leaving others behind. Britain's increasingly lonely position on the euro has boosted concerns about formally permitting a so-called two-speed Europe, even though opt-outs already exist on the single currency, border controls and other issues. All the proposed changes are highly technical but of huge political sensitivity, and will be codified in a treaty of Nice under the French EU presidency in December.

That changed my mind and set the ball rolling.\" </p> <p>That was back in 1995; logically, once the script - complete with new alien language - was written, Grant's first port of call was the BBC (his previous home with the hugely successful Red Dwarf). Except, as Miles Bullough - MD of Absolutely Productions, co-producers of The Strangerers with Grant's own Taken For Granted - explains, the Beeb had \"just bought Third Rock From The Sun, which queered that pitch.\" </p> <p>Hence the move to Sky - but why not simply take the idea to another, more established, channel? Bullough admits he was \"very suspicious\" when he heard Sky were looking to do home-grown comedy; at least ntil being won over by what Grant calls their \"sheer unremitting enthusiasm\". And, yes, James Baker, Head Of Network Programming at Sky, is certainly enthusiastic. </p> <p>\"I think it's absolutely a flagship show\", he gushes. \"If we're going to be serious about creating original programming, we've got to set down a marker to our intentions. And The Strangerers is a perfect marker.\" </p> <p>So far so good. Except it's still not clear what (other than vast sums of money) is in it for the talent? According to Grant, Sky's aforementioned eagerness is in stark contrast with other channels where, he claims \"you can often feel invisible\". For Docherty, meanwhile - coming off the disappointment of his short-lived Channel 5 chat show - \"I'm always interested in doing stuff that hasn't been done before. That said, money is a consideration as well - let's say they've got a decent enough budget!\" </p> <p>Indeed, aside from star salaries, a \u00a3300,000 per episode budget, also means The Strangerers could be shot on film, with quality special effects.\"I'm not trying to be arty about it,\" remarks Baker, \"but if you spend the time and money you build something better.\" Sky's hands-off approach is, he believes, appealing to the talent largely because \"second-guessing the creators is a disease across a lot of television.\" </p> <p>Yet something jars about Sky's new identity as a benevolent patron of the arts.

For John Thoday, MD of Avalon (which represents Baddiel and Murray), it's got more to do with the channel simply having \"gone as far as it can with football and acquired product\". </p> <p>The effusive Baker freely admits that \"if you want people to become emotionally involved with a channel, you've got to provide programming that's relevant to them. We're making Sky more British, more relevant and more recognisable. And The Strangerers is a good way to start doing that.\" Or, as the slightly more sceptical Docherty laughs, \"17 </p> <p>It's true that giving the shows the potential to \"travel\" is one of the keys to Sky's new comedies: The Strangerers has ten parts, while forthcoming shows will have an internationally standard 13 or 22 episodes, instead of the usual six typical of British sitcoms. This six-part format, Thoday argues, not only prevents shows from being sold abroad, but means they can't even compete on home turf with imports: \"The viewer likes to see Friends every week, but then again I'm sure they would have liked to have seen Absolutely Fabulous every week.\" </p> <p>\"Making six episodes\", he continues, \"is like making a film so it won't fit in the projector - it's just not going to get shown.\" </p> <p>Apart from making their own comedy product more marketable abroad, the general hope seems to be that other broadcasters will follow Sky's lead.

Thoday, meanwhile, simply knows good business </p> <p>\"A 22-episode sitcom costs about \u00a35 million\", he points out. \"With the \u00a3100 million-odd that Channel 4 spent on Friends you could make 20 original shows, and of those 20, however bad you were at choosing them, you'd probably have a few hits.\" </p> <p>Whether or not The Strangerers will be a hit for Sky remains to be seen. But the channel's longterm plan must include luring new customers with its original shows, and a series of 10 gives the show enough time to pull in fresh viewers. Baker envisages the show stirring interest - the masterplan is for people to notice Sky's output \"and then go and get it\". Yet, as Thoday says, \"You can't hide with a long-running sitcom - by the end of the run its either successful or its not.

They are now reaching the age when long-term adoption is a remote chance, but even getting them mentally prepared for fostering is a long and painful process. Rikki, 12, has finally come round to the idea, but sister Roxanne, 11, still pitifully pines for her mother. Ten-year-old Curtis also wouldn't mind being fostered, but his sister Leanda is having problems with their mother's fortnightly visits.

Vince, at 30, feels he's ready to grow up and act responsibly, but Stuart is still up for partying hard in Manchester's gay area. Yet even he can't fail to notice that the competition is getting younger. The developing \"will they, won't they\" element between the two best friends certainly steps up a gear, with everyone, bar Stuart, wishing they would just get on with it and settle down together. But Stuart has another problem to deal with, notably a nasty little blackmailer. It might be time to tell his parents about his sexuality. </p> <p> <strong>Black, Bent And Beautiful </strong> 11.20pm, C5<br> While the Queer As Folk boys large it in Canal Street, Trevor Nelson narrates more sobering experiences from a group of gay Londoners who, because they are also black, find life doubly difficult. All four participants readily admit that they get the most grief from their own community. Tariano left his native Jamaica because he feared for his life; his neighbours had a habit of lynching gay men. Rap artist Adeshola Idowu felt she had to leave Nigeria, as homosexuality is illegal there. And Femi desperately wants to be more involved in his church but his sexuality, according to a local pastor, is against the Christian religion.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Kids Alone 9pm, C4 Rikki, Roxanne, Curtis and Leanda are all in care because their mothers couldn't cope. They are now reaching the age when long-term adoption is a remote chance, but even getting them mentally prepared for fostering is a long and painful process. Rikki, 12, has finally come round to the idea, but sister Roxanne, 11, still pitifully pines for her mother. Ten-year-old Curtis also wouldn't mind being fostered, but his sister Leanda is having problems with their mother's fortnightly visits. This is the grim reality behind the oft-used words \"in care\", and it makes for uncomfortable yet thought-provoking viewing. Queer As Folk 2 10pm, C4 The lively and engaging drama returns, but, unfortunately, only for a two-part finale. Vince, at 30, feels he's ready to grow up and act responsibly, but Stuart is still up for partying hard in Manchester's gay area. Yet even he can't fail to notice that the competition is getting younger. The developing \"will they, won't they\" element between the two best friends certainly steps up a gear, with everyone, bar Stuart, wishing they would just get on with it and settle down together. But Stuart has another problem to deal with, notably a nasty little blackmailer. It might be time to tell his parents about his sexuality. Black, Bent And Beautiful 11.20pm, C5 While the Queer As Folk boys large it in Canal Street, Trevor Nelson narrates more sobering experiences from a group of gay Londoners who, because they are also black, find life doubly difficult. All four participants readily admit that they get the most grief from their own community. Tariano left his native Jamaica because he feared for his life; his neighbours had a habit of lynching gay men. Rap artist Adeshola Idowu felt she had to leave Nigeria, as homosexuality is illegal there. And Femi desperately wants to be more involved in his church but his sexuality, according to a local pastor, is against the Christian religion.",

The manoeuvre successfully completed a four-year odyssey that included a failed attempt to rendezvous with the rock last year. </p> <p>\"The NEAR spacecraft is in orbit around the asteroid Eros,\" mission director Robert Farquhar announced minutes after engineers received a signal that a rocket had fired with an error of less than 1 percent. </p> <p>\"We are very happy and very excited,\" said Farquhar. </p> <p>Automatic instructions stored aboard the craft triggered the rocket firing at 10:33am (15:33 GMT) and engineers waited tensely in Mission Control for almost 20 minutes before success was confirmed. They broke into applause when it was clear that NEAR had reached its target. </p> <p>Farquhar said the rocket firing aimed for an Eros orbit of about 200 miles by 299 miles (320 by 480 kilometers) and the craft hit that target within 30 to 40 miles (50 to 65 kilometres). This is considered excellent \"shooting\" for such a small object that is 160 million miles (260 million kilometres) away.</p> <p>Eros is so far out that a radio signal takes 14.5 minutes to reach Earth. Project scientist Andrew Cheng said the success thrilled scientists eager to get an unprecedented close-up view of an asteroid and gather data with five different instruments. </p> <p>\"Today may be Valentine's Day for most people, but its Christmas Eve for me and all the presents are piled about, waiting to be opened,\" said Cheng. </p> <p>NEAR will spend a year orbiting Eros, dropping in stages to lower orbits. It will gather basic research that one day may help humans defend the Earth against a \"killer asteroid\" like the one thought to have wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. </p> <p>\"Understanding the physical characteristics of asteroids will be very important if we are ever called on to deflect one coming at the Earth,\" said Nasa's Carl Pilcher. </p> <p>Although Eros itself poses no threat to Earth, a dangerous asteroid could be discovered at any time, Cheng said. </p> <p>\"This is something humanity needs to be concerned about,\" said Cheng. \"It has happened before on Earth.\" In 1989, an asteroid a quarter-mile wide missed the Earth by just 400,000 miles (640,000 kilometres). Astronomers said the space rock and Earth passed the same point in space just six hours apart. </p> <p>Scientists also hope to learn more about the formation of planets, such as Earth, since Eros may be leftover material from the creation of the solar system. </p> <p>Eros is 21 miles long and eight miles wide; by comparison, New York's Manhattan Island is about 13.5 miles long and 2.5 miles wide. </p> <p>The $224 million NEAR mission was launched February 17, 1996. The craft was supposed to have gone into an orbit of Eros in January 1999, but it malfunctioned after a rocket firing - intended to aim the spacecraft at the asteroid - shut down automatically. </p> <p>NEAR sped past Eros and then went into wild gyrations, cutting its contact with Earth. When engineers again captured the NEAR signal, they found the craft had burned about 20 percent of its fuel. </p> <p>Engineers let NEAR circle the sun for a year, guiding it with fuel-saving small rocket firings toward a Valentine's Day rendezvous with Eros. This time the spacecraft performed without a problem. </p> <p>\"Another perfect day,\" Farquhar announced. </p> <p>During its mission, as NEAR descends closer and closer to Eros, the craft late in the year may actually brush the asteroid's surface with a solar panel and photograph the mark it leaves. </p> <p>NEAR was built under Nasa contract at John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. Scientists from Cornell University and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory also participated. </p> <p>NEAR has five instruments, including a camera that will map and probe every surface inch of Eros. The instruments will measure density, chemical composition and magnetic fields. The camera will send photos in different spectra, in black and white and colour.</p>",

Farquhar said the rocket firing aimed for an Eros orbit of about 200 miles by 299 miles (320 by 480 kilometers) and the craft hit that target within 30 to 40 miles (50 to 65 kilometres). This is considered excellent \"shooting\" for such a small object that is 160 million miles (260 million kilometres) away. Eros is so far out that a radio signal takes 14.5 minutes to reach Earth. Project scientist Andrew Cheng said the success thrilled scientists eager to get an unprecedented close-up view of an asteroid and gather data with five different instruments. \"Today may be Valentine's Day for most people, but its Christmas Eve for me and all the presents are piled about, waiting to be opened,\" said Cheng. NEAR will spend a year orbiting Eros, dropping in stages to lower orbits. It will gather basic research that one day may help humans defend the Earth against a \"killer asteroid\" like the one thought to have wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. \"Understanding the physical characteristics of asteroids will be very important if we are ever called on to deflect one coming at the Earth,\" said Nasa's Carl Pilcher. Although Eros itself poses no threat to Earth, a dangerous asteroid could be discovered at any time, Cheng said. \"This is something humanity needs to be concerned about,\" said Cheng. \"It has happened before on Earth.\" In 1989, an asteroid a quarter-mile wide missed the Earth by just 400,000 miles (640,000 kilometres). Astronomers said the space rock and Earth passed the same point in space just six hours apart. Scientists also hope to learn more about the formation of planets, such as Earth, since Eros may be leftover material from the creation of the solar system. Eros is 21 miles long and eight miles wide; by comparison, New York's Manhattan Island is about 13.5 miles long and 2.5 miles wide. The $224 million NEAR mission was launched February 17, 1996. The craft was supposed to have gone into an orbit of Eros in January 1999, but it malfunctioned after a rocket firing - intended to aim the spacecraft at the asteroid - shut down automatically. NEAR sped past Eros and then went into wild gyrations, cutting its contact with Earth. When engineers again captured the NEAR signal, they found the craft had burned about 20 percent of its fuel. Engineers let NEAR circle the sun for a year, guiding it with fuel-saving small rocket firings toward a Valentine's Day rendezvous with Eros. This time the spacecraft performed without a problem. \"Another perfect day,\" Farquhar announced. During its mission, as NEAR descends closer and closer to Eros, the craft late in the year may actually brush the asteroid's surface with a solar panel and photograph the mark it leaves. NEAR was built under Nasa contract at John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. Scientists from Cornell University and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory also participated. NEAR has five instruments, including a camera that will map and probe every surface inch of Eros. The instruments will measure density, chemical composition and magnetic fields. The camera will send photos in different spectra, in black and white and colour.",

The Fire Brigades Union vote, taken by more than 3,000, nets about 0.5% for the Brent East MP. The FBU result, decided by a secret workplace ballot on a 60% turnout, has given Mr Livingstone his highest share of the vote, beating Mr Dobson by a margin of nearly 40 to one - pushing the Labour leadership's candidate into third place, as happened in last month's transport union poll.

The scale of Mr Livingstone's victory is likely to have been boosted by official FBU endorsement, but it also reflects a pattern of strong support among public service workers in London. An indicative vote by members of the Rail Maritime and Transport union - excluded from the contest because of late payment of Labour affiliation fees - gave Mr Livingstone a similar level of backing, as did the Transport and General Workers' Union ballot.

The career of Ji Pengfei, who has died aged 90, performed a similar great leap.</p> <p>Born in the rural heartland of China, he spent the years of the second world war as a political commissar fighting the Japanese, and then the Chinese nationalists. Soon after liberation he left the country for the first time, to become the new China's ambassador to East Germany.</p> <p>No one could have guessed then, at the height of the cold war, the circumstances in which Ji's name would become familiar to the outside world two decades later. He is enshrined in the 1972 Shanghai communiqu\u00e9 concluded by the US president Richard Nixon and the Chinese premier Zhou Enlai. Nixon and the premier, it says, held \"earnest and frank discussions\" on normalising US-China relations. In addition, US secretary of state William Rogers and Chinese foreign minister Ji \"held talks in the same spirit.\"</p> <p>Ji went on, as head of the Chinese Hong Kong and Macau office, to play a key role in the negotiations over the future of the British colony. He was a tough negotiator in 1983-84 as Mrs Thatcher reluctantly came to accept the inevitability of an eventual handover. He then oversaw the drafting of the Chinese basic law, which governs the one-country-two-systems relationship between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland.</p> <p>After the 1984 agreement, Ji intervened several times during the rocky transition process, visiting Hong Kong three times with varying degrees of cordiality. He made clear China's dislike of speedy political reform in the territory and put forward a doctrine of convergence, which proposed that political change under the British should not outstrip the post-1997 model set out in the basic law.</p> <p>But Ji also insisted that Hong Kong's courts should have the \"final right of adjudication\" because the former colony's social and legal systems were different from the mainland. This is now in question after a court of final appeal decision last year was undermined when Beijing delivered a new \"interpretation\" of the relevant part of the basic law.</p> <p>No one would ever have accused Ji of being either impulsive or particularly affable. Britain's then foreign secretary Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe, describing the critical events of 1984, recalled a stilted Peking duck banquet \"with Ji Pengfei as our less than sparkling host.\" But he was sufficiently trusted to have been called back, at the age of 73, to join the negotiations.</p> <p>Ji came from Linyi, Shanxi province, deep in northern China near a remote bend of the Yellow river. In 1926, at the age of 16, he went to school in an army college - like many young men in those warlord years - to study medicine. Following a revolt by his unit, he transferred his skills to the Red Army and joined the long march.</p> <p>Pursuing politics in the beleaguered communist movement soon left no time for medicine. Ji spent the war as a political commissar in the 3rd field army, led by Marshall Chen Yi. After liberation Chen also shifted to the diplomatic track, becoming China's foreign minister in 1958 and a prime target of the red guards in the cultural revolution 10 years later. Ji, by then a deputy foreign minister, managed to keep his head down.</p> <p>He finally retired in the 1990s, joining a group known as the \"new eight elders\" - to distinguish themselves from the really old veterans headed by the late Mr Deng. He adopted their characteristic lifestyle, however, and he and his entourage were well provided for in housing and transport. He was apparently still consulted on Hong Kong issues, but kept out of the public eye.</p> <p>His son, General Ji Shengde, has been more conspicuous. As head of China's military intelligence, he is alleged to have secretly channelled funds from Beijing to the shadowy Democratic fundraiser Johnny Chung before President Clinton's last election.</p> <p><b> John Gittings</b></p> <p>Ji Pengfei, politician, born 1910; died February 10 2000</p>",

He is enshrined in the 1972 Shanghai communiqu\u00e9 concluded by the US president Richard Nixon and the Chinese premier Zhou Enlai. Nixon and the premier, it says, held \"earnest and frank discussions\" on normalising US-China relations. In addition, US secretary of state William Rogers and Chinese foreign minister Ji \"held talks in the same spirit.\" Ji went on, as head of the Chinese Hong Kong and Macau office, to play a key role in the negotiations over the future of the British colony. He was a tough negotiator in 1983-84 as Mrs Thatcher reluctantly came to accept the inevitability of an eventual handover. He then oversaw the drafting of the Chinese basic law, which governs the one-country-two-systems relationship between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland. After the 1984 agreement, Ji intervened several times during the rocky transition process, visiting Hong Kong three times with varying degrees of cordiality. He made clear China's dislike of speedy political reform in the territory and put forward a doctrine of convergence, which proposed that political change under the British should not outstrip the post-1997 model set out in the basic law. But Ji also insisted that Hong Kong's courts should have the \"final right of adjudication\" because the former colony's social and legal systems were different from the mainland. This is now in question after a court of final appeal decision last year was undermined when Beijing delivered a new \"interpretation\" of the relevant part of the basic law. No one would ever have accused Ji of being either impulsive or particularly affable. Britain's then foreign secretary Geoffrey (now Lord) Howe, describing the critical events of 1984, recalled a stilted Peking duck banquet \"with Ji Pengfei as our less than sparkling host.\" But he was sufficiently trusted to have been called back, at the age of 73, to join the negotiations. Ji came from Linyi, Shanxi province, deep in northern China near a remote bend of the Yellow river. In 1926, at the age of 16, he went to school in an army college - like many young men in those warlord years - to study medicine. Following a revolt by his unit, he transferred his skills to the Red Army and joined the long march. Pursuing politics in the beleaguered communist movement soon left no time for medicine. Ji spent the war as a political commissar in the 3rd field army, led by Marshall Chen Yi. After liberation Chen also shifted to the diplomatic track, becoming China's foreign minister in 1958 and a prime target of the red guards in the cultural revolution 10 years later. Ji, by then a deputy foreign minister, managed to keep his head down. He finally retired in the 1990s, joining a group known as the \"new eight elders\" - to distinguish themselves from the really old veterans headed by the late Mr Deng. He adopted their characteristic lifestyle, however, and he and his entourage were well provided for in housing and transport. He was apparently still consulted on Hong Kong issues, but kept out of the public eye. His son, General Ji Shengde, has been more conspicuous. As head of China's military intelligence, he is alleged to have secretly channelled funds from Beijing to the shadowy Democratic fundraiser Johnny Chung before President Clinton's last election.

      "body": "<p>The Iranian general election on Friday will be crucial - not just for the Islamic republic, but for Islamism everywhere. Islamic fundamentalism was initially perceived by the west as a global threat comparable to that other great messianic ideology of the 20th century, communism, and Ayatollah Khomeini's revolution gave the threat an immense boost.</p> <p>The election will decide whether, in its main stronghold, Islamism is capable of the reform needed for its survival. Even if the outcome of the elections is not decisive, the polls will have highlighted the contradiction that besets Islamism everywhere, between the \"sacred\", reflecting God's sovereignty over people's affairs; and the \"popular\", the people's sovereignty.</p> <p>In Iran's power struggle, President Mohammed Khatami and his reformist camp believe that the popular has precedence over the sacred. The arch-conservatives, headed by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, insist on the reverse.</p> <p>The conservatives will lose this struggle: either peaceably and constitutionally, for in any fair election, the reformists will take control of parliament; or violently, for if they falsify the results the people will eventually turn to insurrection.</p> <p>The conservatives' defeat will reverberate through fundamentalism everywhere. Just as, at its birth, the republic dramatically strengthened a movement then in general ascent, so, now, the republic will accelerate its decline.</p> <p><b> Hardline excesses</b></p> <p>There is much to suggest that Islamism is on the increase. Islam has undergone a revival almost everywhere. And the notion that religion should dominate public life has put down deep roots; most governments have responded to this sentiment with pious gestures, from the prohibition on bank interest imposed by the new military rulers of Pakistan to the Egyptian parliament's retreat from new legislation on women's rights.

      "bodyText": "The Iranian general election on Friday will be crucial - not just for the Islamic republic, but for Islamism everywhere. Islamic fundamentalism was initially perceived by the west as a global threat comparable to that other great messianic ideology of the 20th century, communism, and Ayatollah Khomeini's revolution gave the threat an immense boost. The election will decide whether, in its main stronghold, Islamism is capable of the reform needed for its survival. Even if the outcome of the elections is not decisive, the polls will have highlighted the contradiction that besets Islamism everywhere, between the \"sacred\", reflecting God's sovereignty over people's affairs; and the \"popular\", the people's sovereignty. In Iran's power struggle, President Mohammed Khatami and his reformist camp believe that the popular has precedence over the sacred. The arch-conservatives, headed by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, insist on the reverse. The conservatives will lose this struggle: either peaceably and constitutionally, for in any fair election, the reformists will take control of parliament; or violently, for if they falsify the results the people will eventually turn to insurrection. The conservatives' defeat will reverberate through fundamentalism everywhere. Just as, at its birth, the republic dramatically strengthened a movement then in general ascent, so, now, the republic will accelerate its decline. Hardline excesses There is much to suggest that Islamism is on the increase. Islam has undergone a revival almost everywhere. And the notion that religion should dominate public life has put down deep roots; most governments have responded to this sentiment with pious gestures, from the prohibition on bank interest imposed by the new military rulers of Pakistan to the Egyptian parliament's retreat from new legislation on women's rights. Bigotry and extremism are rampant still. On the 11th anniversary of the fatwa against Salman Rushdie yesterday, the hardline Islamist Khordad foundation increased its bounty for any Muslim who executes the British author. In Indonesia, once a bastion of inter-communal tolerance, 100,000 demonstrators riot in Jakarta. Addressing them, Amien Rais, the speaker of the people's consultative assembly, says \"tolerance is absurd\", giving the green light for Christians to be massacred by Muslims. Moderate Islamists are the most powerful opposition force in most Muslim countries. From Malaysia, where in recent elections they greatly increased their parliamentary representation, to Nigeria, where one federal state has adopted the sharia , or \"holy law\", they continue to make gains. In Chechnya, that most bloody front line of the \"clash of civilisations\", a small band of Islamists, infused with extraordinary valour, are keeping the might of Orthodox Russia at bay. More spectacular Islamist triumphs may lie ahead. The \"Talibanisation\" of Pakistan now looks a possibility. Failure of Islamist rule Yet the evidence points to the fact that Islamism is in decline. At first, Islamism thrived ideologically on the failure of secular-modernist credos which Muslim societies borrowed from the west. Its natural constituency was the middle and lower classes, which should have benefited most from the secular-modernist order, but actually suffered most. Its rank and file in the vast new urban slums from Jakarta to Cairo sought social justice and political representation, but using religious, not discredited leftwing, means to achieve them. Its activists were often former communists. While bent on \"renewal\", these early Islamists looked for it in asala - back-to-roots cultural authenticity - and found it in the 7th century Koran. The literal interpretation of the holy book reduced human freedom to a minimum. Islamists had two alternative routes to political power.

A total of 18 private firms are involved in the running of local jails, private prisons and immigration detention centres. It is estimated that firms such as Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch write between $2-3bn in prison constructions bonds every year. This has led some commentators to suggest that the United States is effectively creating a prison-industrial complex in much the same way as the military-industrial complex operates. Critics of the system suggest that so much money is invested in incarceration that politicians would find it difficult to reverse the trends against the wishes of their financial backers and lobbyists. In his study Christian Parenti suggests: \"In many ways the incarceration binge is simply the policy byproduct of rightwing electoral rhetoric.\" With the economic restructuring of America, politicians found it necessary to address domestic anxieties, Parenti suggests and this \"required scapegoats, a role usually filled by new immigrants, the poor and people of colour\".

Today's vigils are being held near jails, courthouses and prisons and span the US from Spokane in Washington state to Gainesville in Florida, from Austin in Texas to Newhaven in Connecticut. In 1985, the then Chief Justice Warren Burger said: \"What business enterprise could conceivably succeed with the rate of recall of its products that we see in the 'products' of our prisons?\" The demonstrators today are hoping to make the same point count, if not with the politicians, then at least with the voters who will be called in to endorse such penal policies in the coming months.

      "bodyText": "Two teenagers who attended Columbine high school - the scene of the biggest classroom massacre in American history - were found shot dead yesterday in a sandwich shop. The bodies of a boy of 15 and a 16-year-old girl were discovered less than a mile from the school in a suburb of Denver where two teenagers, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, shot dead 12 pupils and a teacher before turning the guns on themselves last April. At least one of yesterday's victims worked at the shop. \"As far as a motive, I think it will be a while before we can establish that,\" said Steve Davis, a police spokesman. The new killings coincided with the disclosure that Harris and Klebold were much more heavily armed than was previously realised. The pair were equipped with 95 explosive devices, enough to destroy the buildings and kill hundreds of pupils.",

At the heart of the dispute is a 1996 report by the magazine, Consumer Reports - the American equivalent of Which? magazine - in which the testers claimed that the Isuzu Trooper sports utility vehicle (SUV) had a tendency to roll over while taking very sharp turns. \"If you already own one, drive it only when necessary and use extreme caution,\" the report said of the Trooper.

The SUV is one of the most popular vehicles for young, affluent Americans, but it has drawn criticism from environmentalists for its bulk, fuel consumption and the damage it can do when driven off-road.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>I stared at the body, blinking in disbelief. We were in the shadow of the First Step, so the light was dull. The body lay about 10 metres from where I stood and was angled away from me. It jerked - a horrible movement, like a puppet being pulled savagely by its strings.</p> <p>We had been on a well-organised and, so far, successful trail towards the summit of Everest, worrying only about ourselves. Now a stranger lay across our path, moaning. Lhakpa shouted down at me and waved me to move on, to follow him up onto the Step. I looked back at the raggedly jerking figure.</p> <p>Each team or solo climber did, or should, arrive at the mountain self-sufficient. Anyone who turned up assuming they could borrow food, clothing or tentage would receive short shrift. Similarly, you could not climb yourself to a standstill then expect other teams to risk their lives to save you.</p> <p>Saving someone was not straightforward. There was no emergency number to call, no mountain rescue to whom the problem could be handed over. We would not be able to walk away, feeling we had done our civic duty and that \"the experts\" were now in charge. Anyone who becomes immobile on a mountain as large and remote as Everest is probably going to die. On this side of the mountain, we would have to get the victim all the way back to base camp before we could contemplate trying to find a helicopter. If they had to be carried, that would require a number of teams, dozens of people, and at least three days climbing.</p> <p>Whoever it was on the rocks in front of me was so badly incapacitated that they had spent the night out on the mountain rather than crawl down. Life lay in keeping moving, as that generated body heat and, with every metre of descent, moved you into thicker air. I suspected we had virtually no chance of saving this climber.</p> <p>We stood to throw away an entire expedition: the money, the time, the thousands of vertical feet of physical and mental effort. We had sponsors who expected us to go for the summit. We had personal ambitions that pointed in the same direction. We were only 240 vertical metres from the top, only four or five hours in climbing time. We were so close to fulfilling everything we had set out to do.</p> <p>Should we throw it all away for some rescue attempt that was doomed? The body was lying in a ghastly inverted V. It looked as if the climber's spine might be broken. If they couldn't walk they were probably condemned. Why waste time, stand around getting cold and demoralised, when the attempt was futile? Why not just turn away and climb on? This all ran through my head in the space of a few seconds. But all the debates, the issues, the logical analysis were useless. I simply could not do it. I could not put the summit of a mountain ahead of a human life. I would not want to live with myself if I could. However hopeless this person's situation might be, I had to try. I walked back to Ian, who was standing with Jangbu, watching Lhakpa climbing the First Step.</p> <p>\"That body's alive. I'm going to have a look.\" It took him a moment to understand what I was talking about. \"We can't just leave,\" I insisted.</p> <p>He nodded and I stepped down from the trail and walked across the loose shale towards the body. I thought it might be one of the Russian team. The person was lying with their harness clipped to a line of fixed rope, stomach uppermost, head and legs dangling down on either side. I knelt down cautiously next to the body and saw it was a woman.</p> <p>\"Don't leave me,\" she said. Her skin was milky white, and totally smooth. It was a sign of severe frostbite and it made her look like a porcelain doll. Her eyes stared up at me, unfocusing, pupils huge dark voids. \"Don't leave me,\" she murmured again.</p> <p>I felt sick. With her long, dark hair, she looked like me. For a shocked second, I felt as if I was glimpsing a possible future for myself. The fact that she was conscious both encouraged and appalled me. It might be possible to save her - or we might yet have to leave her.</p> <p>\"I need to fetch the rest of my team,\" I said to her. \"We have several people here. We will try and help you. I will come back, I promise.\"</p> <p>\"Why are you doing this to me?\" she asked.</p> <p>Ian and Jangbu came back with me. Lhakpa, Pemba and Ci Luo, seeing the turn events had taken, began to descend towards us. The woman had no visible trauma injuries and her bizarre position turned out to be the result of complete muscular limpness. She was as helpless as a rag doll. It looked as if someone had clipped her harness to the end of a fixed rope, presumably so she would not slip down the slope, and had then left her to go for help. Next to her was an orange bottle of oxygen, of Russian make, and a mask. The bottle was empty.</p> <p>While Ian and Jangbu pulled her straight, I collected her down gloves, which had been thrown to one side. Her jacket was over her shoulders but her arms were not in the sleeves. Our bodies can react bizarrely to trauma. A fairly common occurrence with severe hypothermia is a sensation of extreme warmth. The victim may start tearing off clothing; it looked as if she had done this.</p> <p>The men tried to replace her clothing. Her hands were swollen masses, her arms limp. She had no motor control. As Ian tried to get her arms into her sleeves, she gave no resistance and no assistance. Jangbu was trying to give her hot juice from his thermos. Then they each grabbed her under one arm and tried to pull her into a sitting position against a boulder. She was a dead weight. The two strong men took several heaves to get her sitting, and then both doubled over, gasping for breath. It showed us what it would take to try to actually carry her anywhere, let alone carry her or drag her for days down the mountain.</p> <p>We had no capacity for giving her oxygen. Her mask would not fit our bottles. We carried spare bottles but no spare masks. For the oxygen to have any effect, she would have to be put on high flow, and stay on for hours. A few whiffs would have no effect. One of us would have to go off oxygen permanently to give her a mask, which would exhaust our spare supplies very quickly. Until we established that we had a real chance of saving her, the risk was too great.</p> <p>We had no means of communication with the outside world. Pemba tried calling base camp, but their set was not switched on.</p> <p>\"I am an American. I am an American,\" the climber suddenly said.</p> <p>American? But the American team was below us, a full day behind. My mind wandered back to what I had seen the day before: two tiny figures at the foot of the First Step, one still, one moving around.</p> <p>Could she be Fran, the bubbly American woman who had sat in our ABC kitchen tent one night, passing the hours while she waited for her husband, the Russian climber, Serguei? That might make sense. She and Serguei were climbing as a twosome. They had no Sherpas, no oxygen. They would not be in radio contact with others on the mountain. But that did not explain how she came to have an oxygen bottle lying next to her. Nor did it explain where he had gone. Three Uzbek climbers were approaching.</p> <p>\"Will you help us?\" I asked. \"This woman is dying. We might be able to carry her down. Would you help?\"</p> <p>The leader of the three looked down at me reluctantly. \"We tried to help yesterday. We left her with oxygen. She is too far gone to help.\"</p> <p>He spoke into his radio, presumably talking to his base camp. However, they did stay, watching Ian and Jangbu to see what decision they took. Ian had the climber by both shoulders and was speaking directly at her, his face only inches from hers. \"You have to help us. If you can help us, we can try and move you down the mountain. If you don't you are going to die.\" He was staring into her face, looking for some reaction. There was nothing. She knew we were there, but she was not mentally coherent. It was difficult to know what was left in her head.</p> <p>I noticed her other crampon a few feet below us and took a tentative step down the slope to retrieve it, but immediately thought better of it. The slope was covered in loose rock shards, like a million smashed dinner plates. They were slipping away under my feet, rolling down the slope towards the Rongbuk glacier 4,300 metres below us. It was like trying to move across ball-bearings. I could see how a climber, having lost their balance, would not be able to stop the downward momentum. Had that happened to Serguei?</p> <p>Ian and Jangbu had been trying to pull the woman into an upright position. Ian thought that if she could take some of her weight on her feet, even if she could not actually walk, it might be possible to move her down the mountain with a climber at each shoulder. However, her legs simply crumpled under her weight, as useless as strands of spaghetti.</p> <p>We had been with Fran for nearly an hour, standing still in temperatures of around -30 C. Perched perilously on the steep, unstable slope, I could not even stamp my feet for warmth. I was beginning to feel profoundly cold. My fingers were almost totally numb. I had full-body shivers and my teeth were chattering behind my oxygen mask.</p> <p>The decision to leave Fran came upon us without much discussion. The Uzbek climbers and Lhakpa had long been of that opinion. What hope I had faded in the face of her incoherence, her physical incapacity. Now Ian and Jangbu straightened up and turned away. She had stopped talking and seemed to have sunk into unconsciousness. The thought of going on was intolerable. I had lost the will to reach the summit. Besides the physical drain of the cold, I was emotionally shattered. I had never encountered anything like this. I had passed bodies, I had had friends not come back, but I had never watched anyone die. Nor had I had to decide to leave them.</p> <p>It was harder for me because she was female.

      "bodyText": "I stared at the body, blinking in disbelief. We were in the shadow of the First Step, so the light was dull. The body lay about 10 metres from where I stood and was angled away from me. It jerked - a horrible movement, like a puppet being pulled savagely by its strings. We had been on a well-organised and, so far, successful trail towards the summit of Everest, worrying only about ourselves. Now a stranger lay across our path, moaning. Lhakpa shouted down at me and waved me to move on, to follow him up onto the Step. I looked back at the raggedly jerking figure. Each team or solo climber did, or should, arrive at the mountain self-sufficient. Anyone who turned up assuming they could borrow food, clothing or tentage would receive short shrift. Similarly, you could not climb yourself to a standstill then expect other teams to risk their lives to save you. Saving someone was not straightforward. There was no emergency number to call, no mountain rescue to whom the problem could be handed over. We would not be able to walk away, feeling we had done our civic duty and that \"the experts\" were now in charge. Anyone who becomes immobile on a mountain as large and remote as Everest is probably going to die. On this side of the mountain, we would have to get the victim all the way back to base camp before we could contemplate trying to find a helicopter. If they had to be carried, that would require a number of teams, dozens of people, and at least three days climbing. Whoever it was on the rocks in front of me was so badly incapacitated that they had spent the night out on the mountain rather than crawl down. Life lay in keeping moving, as that generated body heat and, with every metre of descent, moved you into thicker air. I suspected we had virtually no chance of saving this climber. We stood to throw away an entire expedition: the money, the time, the thousands of vertical feet of physical and mental effort. We had sponsors who expected us to go for the summit. We had personal ambitions that pointed in the same direction. We were only 240 vertical metres from the top, only four or five hours in climbing time. We were so close to fulfilling everything we had set out to do. Should we throw it all away for some rescue attempt that was doomed? The body was lying in a ghastly inverted V. It looked as if the climber's spine might be broken. If they couldn't walk they were probably condemned. Why waste time, stand around getting cold and demoralised, when the attempt was futile? Why not just turn away and climb on? This all ran through my head in the space of a few seconds. But all the debates, the issues, the logical analysis were useless. I simply could not do it. I could not put the summit of a mountain ahead of a human life. I would not want to live with myself if I could. However hopeless this person's situation might be, I had to try. I walked back to Ian, who was standing with Jangbu, watching Lhakpa climbing the First Step. \"That body's alive. I'm going to have a look.\" It took him a moment to understand what I was talking about. \"We can't just leave,\" I insisted. He nodded and I stepped down from the trail and walked across the loose shale towards the body. I thought it might be one of the Russian team. The person was lying with their harness clipped to a line of fixed rope, stomach uppermost, head and legs dangling down on either side. I knelt down cautiously next to the body and saw it was a woman. \"Don't leave me,\" she said. Her skin was milky white, and totally smooth. It was a sign of severe frostbite and it made her look like a porcelain doll. Her eyes stared up at me, unfocusing, pupils huge dark voids. \"Don't leave me,\" she murmured again. I felt sick. With her long, dark hair, she looked like me. For a shocked second, I felt as if I was glimpsing a possible future for myself. The fact that she was conscious both encouraged and appalled me. It might be possible to save her - or we might yet have to leave her. \"I need to fetch the rest of my team,\" I said to her. \"We have several people here. We will try and help you. I will come back, I promise.\" \"Why are you doing this to me?\" she asked. Ian and Jangbu came back with me. Lhakpa, Pemba and Ci Luo, seeing the turn events had taken, began to descend towards us. The woman had no visible trauma injuries and her bizarre position turned out to be the result of complete muscular limpness. She was as helpless as a rag doll. It looked as if someone had clipped her harness to the end of a fixed rope, presumably so she would not slip down the slope, and had then left her to go for help. Next to her was an orange bottle of oxygen, of Russian make, and a mask. The bottle was empty. While Ian and Jangbu pulled her straight, I collected her down gloves, which had been thrown to one side. Her jacket was over her shoulders but her arms were not in the sleeves. Our bodies can react bizarrely to trauma. A fairly common occurrence with severe hypothermia is a sensation of extreme warmth. The victim may start tearing off clothing; it looked as if she had done this. The men tried to replace her clothing. Her hands were swollen masses, her arms limp. She had no motor control. As Ian tried to get her arms into her sleeves, she gave no resistance and no assistance. Jangbu was trying to give her hot juice from his thermos. Then they each grabbed her under one arm and tried to pull her into a sitting position against a boulder. She was a dead weight. The two strong men took several heaves to get her sitting, and then both doubled over, gasping for breath. It showed us what it would take to try to actually carry her anywhere, let alone carry her or drag her for days down the mountain. We had no capacity for giving her oxygen. Her mask would not fit our bottles. We carried spare bottles but no spare masks. For the oxygen to have any effect, she would have to be put on high flow, and stay on for hours. A few whiffs would have no effect. One of us would have to go off oxygen permanently to give her a mask, which would exhaust our spare supplies very quickly. Until we established that we had a real chance of saving her, the risk was too great. We had no means of communication with the outside world. Pemba tried calling base camp, but their set was not switched on. \"I am an American. I am an American,\" the climber suddenly said. American? But the American team was below us, a full day behind. My mind wandered back to what I had seen the day before: two tiny figures at the foot of the First Step, one still, one moving around. Could she be Fran, the bubbly American woman who had sat in our ABC kitchen tent one night, passing the hours while she waited for her husband, the Russian climber, Serguei? That might make sense. She and Serguei were climbing as a twosome. They had no Sherpas, no oxygen. They would not be in radio contact with others on the mountain. But that did not explain how she came to have an oxygen bottle lying next to her. Nor did it explain where he had gone. Three Uzbek climbers were approaching. \"Will you help us?\" I asked. \"This woman is dying. We might be able to carry her down. Would you help?\" The leader of the three looked down at me reluctantly. \"We tried to help yesterday. We left her with oxygen. She is too far gone to help.\" He spoke into his radio, presumably talking to his base camp. However, they did stay, watching Ian and Jangbu to see what decision they took. Ian had the climber by both shoulders and was speaking directly at her, his face only inches from hers. \"You have to help us. If you can help us, we can try and move you down the mountain. If you don't you are going to die.\" He was staring into her face, looking for some reaction. There was nothing. She knew we were there, but she was not mentally coherent. It was difficult to know what was left in her head. I noticed her other crampon a few feet below us and took a tentative step down the slope to retrieve it, but immediately thought better of it. The slope was covered in loose rock shards, like a million smashed dinner plates. They were slipping away under my feet, rolling down the slope towards the Rongbuk glacier 4,300 metres below us. It was like trying to move across ball-bearings. I could see how a climber, having lost their balance, would not be able to stop the downward momentum. Had that happened to Serguei? Ian and Jangbu had been trying to pull the woman into an upright position. Ian thought that if she could take some of her weight on her feet, even if she could not actually walk, it might be possible to move her down the mountain with a climber at each shoulder. However, her legs simply crumpled under her weight, as useless as strands of spaghetti. We had been with Fran for nearly an hour, standing still in temperatures of around -30 C. Perched perilously on the steep, unstable slope, I could not even stamp my feet for warmth. I was beginning to feel profoundly cold. My fingers were almost totally numb. I had full-body shivers and my teeth were chattering behind my oxygen mask. The decision to leave Fran came upon us without much discussion. The Uzbek climbers and Lhakpa had long been of that opinion. What hope I had faded in the face of her incoherence, her physical incapacity. Now Ian and Jangbu straightened up and turned away. She had stopped talking and seemed to have sunk into unconsciousness. The thought of going on was intolerable. I had lost the will to reach the summit. Besides the physical drain of the cold, I was emotionally shattered. I had never encountered anything like this. I had passed bodies, I had had friends not come back, but I had never watched anyone die. Nor had I had to decide to leave them. It was harder for me because she was female. It is not that I thought women immune to the risk, but it was such a male-dominated environment. Everywhere you turned, everyone you talked to was male. I climb because I enjoy it. I climb for the pleasure of the activity, of the surroundings. There was no pleasure left. I wanted to be down, to be off the mountain, to have both feet on flat ground. \u0095 After abandoning that attempt, O'Dowd went on, in 1999, to become the first woman to reach the summit from both south and north.

      "body": "<p>In the ever-shifting landscape of US politics, there have been a few enduring shibboleths, none more so than the overwhelming public support for the death penalty. No serious candidate for national office even dares to raise it as an issue. That was the conventional wisdom until a few days ago, when something remarkable happened: America started to think again about execution.</p> <p>On January 31, a moratorium was declared in Illinois by a Republican governor, George Ryan, who had formerly been an enthusiastic supporter of lethal injection as punishment for capital crimes. That shocking announcement opened the floodgates - 15 of 38 states with the death penalty quickly declared their policies would be re-examined.</p> <p>Last Friday, the attorney-general, Janet Reno, launched a justice department investigation into whether capital punishment is inflicted disproportionately on black people. On the same day, a bill designed to improve defendants' chances of proving their innocence was presented to the senate. This week, President Clinton is considering arguments for a federal moratorium and the presidential candidates, pro-death penalty all, are being persistently questioned about their stand.</p> <p>This is an extraordinary turnaround for an issue which - as recently as last month - was considered politically dead. But even more extraordinary is that this accelerating chain of events was set in motion by an undergraduate journalism class in Chicago.</p> <p>For their class projects, students at Northwestern university's Medill school of journalism re-examined a string of capital convictions built on minimal evidence and dubious confessions. Their investigations have so far led to the exoneration of three convicts on death row, and the freeing of five others serving long jail terms. Their work raised the spectre that convicts, usually black men, were being put to death for crimes they did not commit. No one was more surprised than the students themselves - who, like most people, had assumed that their fellow citizens would not be sentenced to death without cast-iron proof. Overturning one case after another, they found nothing could be further from the truth. \"If I'm 21 and skipping class to do work, and at the same time manage to prove that a convicted man is totally innocent, then it shows how fallible the system is,\" says Shawn Armbrust, a former Medill student.</p> <p>The case Armbrust studied was the latest in the Medill class's string of successes. The convict they managed to free, Anthony Porter, had spent 16 years in jail and been within 50 hours of lethal injection. But the class proved the case against him was a brittle edifice of lies, incompetence and malice. The media uproar accompanying Porter's release last February led eventually to Governor Ryan's change of heart over the death penalty.</p> <p>When the Porter case was first handed to Armbrust and a group of fellow students as a class assignment in 1998, they were at best agnostic on his guilt or innocence. Their teacher, David Protess, is a meticulous investigator and campaigner who had a track record overturning miscarriages of justice, but his critics said he was too passionate about the cause to be entirely objective.</p> <p>Porter was jailed in 1972 for the murder of two teenagers in a Chicago park. He consistently protested his innocence and there was no direct physical evidence tying him to the crime, but an eyewitness testified he had seen Porter fire the shots and that was enough to convict him. Protess told his students to go through the entire court record and trace the case back to its roots. So, in autumn 1998, Armbrust and her friends found themselves wandering around the south Chicago park, examining the scene of the crime - four white college kids in a poor, mainly black neighbourhood.</p> <p>\"We had no idea what we were going to find,\" Armbrust says. \"I stood where the murder happened. Others stood where the witness was, and couldn't see a thing. A wrought-iron fence was in the way.\"</p> <p>One of the class then went to visit the eyewitness, William Taylor, accompanied by Paul Ciolino, a private investigator and former policeman who had befriended Protess and helped out with the students' investigations. Within 20 minutes, Taylor recanted his testimony, saying that the police had \"threatened, harassed and intimidated\" him into identifying Porter. Protess, however, knew the retraction would never be enough to overturn Porter's death penalty. \"I knew that only a confession by the actual murderer would do,\" he says.</p> <p>His students devoted themselves full-time to the investigation, cancelling holidays and missing other classes as they pored over old transcripts and tapes of the trial, which had clearly been a travesty of justice. \"There were a couple of times I could hear the judge telling someone to wake up the defence counsel after he'd fallen asleep,\" Armbrust says.</p> <p>The class's attention was drawn to two local residents, Alstory Simon and his wife Inez Jackson, who had been questioned by the police after the murders and who had left town two days later. They tracked Jackson down in Milwaukee, where she was sick with Aids, and took her out for a meal in a local restaurant.</p> <p>\"She said Alstory had abused her, and that he had once pulled a gun on her, but she was now free of him,\" Armbrust says. \"She was looking at me the whole time and there seemed to be something there. And then suddenly David [Protess] said: 'We know what happened in the park that night.' She turned silent. She said she had heard shots next to her and then Alstory dragged her away telling her to shut up or he would kill her. My family lived in Milwaukee, so we took her to my parents' house and Paul [Ciolino] taped her confession in my mum's dining room. She said it was a burden off her soul.\"</p> <p>With Jackson's testimony in their files, the class trooped off to South Chicago to find Alstory Simon. \"Looking back on it, it was a pretty stupid thing to do, but it seemed the right thing at the time,\" Armbrust says. Simon talked to the students, sounding them out for what they knew, but denied any involvement. But Ciolino sensed him wavering and went back to see him at the crack of dawn two weeks later. \"I got him up at five in the morning and said I was in a hurry. I just showed him the affidavits, and he confessed pretty quickly,\" Ciolino says.</p> <p>Porter was free two days later. Emerging into the Chicago winter light after 16 years on death row, he ran straight to Protess and lifted him off the ground. Then he did the same thing to Armbrust and the rest of the students who had gathered outside the jail. \"I'm just overwhelmed,\" Porter said at the time. \"I been down so long, I been trying to fight for my life for so long. And these people trying to kill me. Them crooked cops framed me. They didn't care nothing for the truth. It hurt me so much. My life is torn apart.\"</p> <p>Porter has the right to sue for wrongful imprisonment, but despite the evidence of his innocence, the bureaucratic obstacles to redress are daunting. The only financial help he has received to help rebuild his life has been $5,000 (\u00a33,000) - a down-payment from a film producer interested in the rights to his story. \"Only in America would we depend on a Hollywood producer to give money as recompense for a man who had been falsely imprisoned,\" Protess points out.</p> <p>Since the death penalty was reintroduced in Illinois in 1977, 13 inmates on death row have been proved innocent - more than have been executed.

      "bodyText": "In the ever-shifting landscape of US politics, there have been a few enduring shibboleths, none more so than the overwhelming public support for the death penalty. No serious candidate for national office even dares to raise it as an issue. That was the conventional wisdom until a few days ago, when something remarkable happened: America started to think again about execution. On January 31, a moratorium was declared in Illinois by a Republican governor, George Ryan, who had formerly been an enthusiastic supporter of lethal injection as punishment for capital crimes. That shocking announcement opened the floodgates - 15 of 38 states with the death penalty quickly declared their policies would be re-examined. Last Friday, the attorney-general, Janet Reno, launched a justice department investigation into whether capital punishment is inflicted disproportionately on black people. On the same day, a bill designed to improve defendants' chances of proving their innocence was presented to the senate. This week, President Clinton is considering arguments for a federal moratorium and the presidential candidates, pro-death penalty all, are being persistently questioned about their stand. This is an extraordinary turnaround for an issue which - as recently as last month - was considered politically dead. But even more extraordinary is that this accelerating chain of events was set in motion by an undergraduate journalism class in Chicago. For their class projects, students at Northwestern university's Medill school of journalism re-examined a string of capital convictions built on minimal evidence and dubious confessions. Their investigations have so far led to the exoneration of three convicts on death row, and the freeing of five others serving long jail terms. Their work raised the spectre that convicts, usually black men, were being put to death for crimes they did not commit. No one was more surprised than the students themselves - who, like most people, had assumed that their fellow citizens would not be sentenced to death without cast-iron proof. Overturning one case after another, they found nothing could be further from the truth. \"If I'm 21 and skipping class to do work, and at the same time manage to prove that a convicted man is totally innocent, then it shows how fallible the system is,\" says Shawn Armbrust, a former Medill student.

      "body": "<p>As the debate rages on in Japan about how to reform the country's outdated management model, all eyes are on the two cities which have come to represent the beauty and the beast of the alternatives. </p> <p>Toyota City, the headquarters of Japan's biggest carmaker, and Musashi Murayama, the site of a huge Nissan plant west of Tokyo, were once mentioned in the same breath as the shining lights of the Japanese economic miracle. </p> <p>Foreign businessmen would flock there to learn about lifetime employment, seniority-based promotion and other pillars of an economic system that was the envy of the world. </p> <p>But that system, which worked so well to achieve success and expansion, has proved ill equipped to cope with the failure and contraction of the past 10 years, now known in Japan as the \"lost decade\". </p> <p>The decline is symbolised by the plight of the town of Musashi Murayama, threatening to wreck the lives of its 60,000 citizens. Nissan once employed 6,000 people here and contributed 60% of the municipal budget. But the shabby city hall is evidence of the fact that the company, which has posted losses for the last five years, has not paid full taxes for some time. </p> <p>The town is bracing itself for the closure of the plant, which is part of the most brutal restructuring program ever undertaken by a Japanese manufacturer. The Nissan revival plan, announced in October, axes five plants, 21,000 jobs and links with more than half Nissan's suppliers. </p> <p>Local people blame the decline on the arrogance of Nissan's former executives, who believed cross-shareholdings and close ties with bankers and politicians would protect them from a crisis they refused to acknowledge until it was too late. </p> <p>But there is also anger with the man behind the revival plan, Carlos Ghosn, who became chief operating officer of Nissan after France's Renault took a life-saving 37% stake in the ailing company last year. </p> <p>In the Japanese press, Ghosn is known as \"le cost cutter\", and there are constant references to ruthless \"western\" methods. It is not quite true: the job cuts will be made through natural attrition and workers at Musashi Murayama have been offered alternative employment hundreds of miles away with incentives of up to 3m yen, or \u00a316,800, to relocate. </p> <p>But his methods have stunned employees who took out home loans from Nissan on the understanding that they were had a job for life. A third have still not decided whether to move. </p> <p>\"In the Japanese way of thinking, Ghosn's plan is unforgivable,\" said Shigeki Sakai of the all-Japan metal and information machinery workers' union, which joined a recent protest of 8,000 workers against the closure. \"There has never been anything like this before. Companies have gone bankrupt rather than do this.\" </p> <p>Another fierce critic is Hiroshi Okuda, chairman of Toyota and head of the Japanese employers' federation, who champions a \"third way\" between Japan's traditional corporate culture and no holds barred global capitalism. </p> <p>This has made Toyota City a beacon of hope for those - probably the majority in Japan - who balk at western management techniques. </p> <p>Filled with gleaming buildings of marble and glass, the company's home town could hardly offer more of a contrast with Musashi Murayama. A fifth of its 350,000 population is directly employed at more than a dozen local Toyota factories, where the average annual wage for union workers is 6m yen.

      "bodyText": "As the debate rages on in Japan about how to reform the country's outdated management model, all eyes are on the two cities which have come to represent the beauty and the beast of the alternatives. Toyota City, the headquarters of Japan's biggest carmaker, and Musashi Murayama, the site of a huge Nissan plant west of Tokyo, were once mentioned in the same breath as the shining lights of the Japanese economic miracle. Foreign businessmen would flock there to learn about lifetime employment, seniority-based promotion and other pillars of an economic system that was the envy of the world. But that system, which worked so well to achieve success and expansion, has proved ill equipped to cope with the failure and contraction of the past 10 years, now known in Japan as the \"lost decade\". The decline is symbolised by the plight of the town of Musashi Murayama, threatening to wreck the lives of its 60,000 citizens. Nissan once employed 6,000 people here and contributed 60% of the municipal budget. But the shabby city hall is evidence of the fact that the company, which has posted losses for the last five years, has not paid full taxes for some time. The town is bracing itself for the closure of the plant, which is part of the most brutal restructuring program ever undertaken by a Japanese manufacturer. The Nissan revival plan, announced in October, axes five plants, 21,000 jobs and links with more than half Nissan's suppliers. Local people blame the decline on the arrogance of Nissan's former executives, who believed cross-shareholdings and close ties with bankers and politicians would protect them from a crisis they refused to acknowledge until it was too late. But there is also anger with the man behind the revival plan, Carlos Ghosn, who became chief operating officer of Nissan after France's Renault took a life-saving 37% stake in the ailing company last year. In the Japanese press, Ghosn is known as \"le cost cutter\", and there are constant references to ruthless \"western\" methods. It is not quite true: the job cuts will be made through natural attrition and workers at Musashi Murayama have been offered alternative employment hundreds of miles away with incentives of up to 3m yen, or \u00a316,800, to relocate. But his methods have stunned employees who took out home loans from Nissan on the understanding that they were had a job for life. A third have still not decided whether to move. \"In the Japanese way of thinking, Ghosn's plan is unforgivable,\" said Shigeki Sakai of the all-Japan metal and information machinery workers' union, which joined a recent protest of 8,000 workers against the closure. \"There has never been anything like this before. Companies have gone bankrupt rather than do this.\" Another fierce critic is Hiroshi Okuda, chairman of Toyota and head of the Japanese employers' federation, who champions a \"third way\" between Japan's traditional corporate culture and no holds barred global capitalism. This has made Toyota City a beacon of hope for those - probably the majority in Japan - who balk at western management techniques. Filled with gleaming buildings of marble and glass, the company's home town could hardly offer more of a contrast with Musashi Murayama. A fifth of its 350,000 population is directly employed at more than a dozen local Toyota factories, where the average annual wage for union workers is 6m yen. With the company and its affiliates providing everything from sports facilities to marriage counselling and funeral services, it is more like a socialist utopia than the hub of one of capitalism's biggest empires. But change is on the way - not least because the company listed last year on the London and New York stock exchanges, where investors will be looking for higher profit margins than Toyota offers now. Last year the company avoided full-time job losses despite a 25% cut in domestic production to 3.1m units. Executives admit, however, that if production falls below 3m, the pressure to trim the workforce will be hard to resist. The uncertainty of the times is illustrated by the fact that the company now talks of \"long-term employment\", rather than the \"lifelong employment\" of the past. It is also gradually shifting from a seniority to a merit-based pay system. This is vital, as the company has five middle managers for every two at General Motors, which means big salary costs and slow decision-making. \"There is a big movement to reform traditional Japanese business practices but not necessarily towards western-style capitalism,\" said Mitsuo Kinoshita, director of human resources at Toyota. \"The Japanese system has its strong points. As long as we make improvement on a daily basis, we don't need major surgery.\" Whether to adopt domestic remedies or western-style amputation remains the subject of fierce debate. The public would undoubtedly prefer Toyota's \"new Japanese way\", but few companies are strong enough to take such a long term view. At the same time there is a reluctance to follow Ghosn, whose ability to save Nissan is still far from certain - last week its credit rating was cut to junk status.

Phillip Tarsh, the company's most senior non-executive director, has become acting chairman until a new figurehead is appointed. </p> <p>The Ghanaian government, which holds a 20% stake and a golden share in Ashanti, has called for a meeting with shareholders this week to discuss ways forward for the problem-stricken group. </p> <p>The courts have ruled that Ashanti cannot enter into new financial transactions until after the meeting. </p> <p>But the company had been due to sign a $100m loan agreement last Thursday, and needs cash quickly to pay for work on the attractive Geita gold project in Tanzania.

      "bodyText": "Hard-pressed Ashanti Goldfields fired its finance director, Mark Keatley, yesterday and confirmed that the chairman, Ghanaian finance minister Richard Kwame Peprah, had resigned. Africa's third-largest gold producer had been under pressure to dismiss Mr Keatley following massive losses on its gold hedging book which brought the Accra-based group to the brink of default. Ashanti last week was ordered to hold an extraordinary general meeting on March 3 to consider demands for board changes from disgruntled investors led by Swiss-based Adryx Mining and Metals. Ashanti has proposed that Mr Keatley steps down formally after completing the final accounts for 1999, although it wants him to stay on until a successor is found. Mr Kwame Peprah has left with effect from last week to concentrate on his governmental role. Phillip Tarsh, the company's most senior non-executive director, has become acting chairman until a new figurehead is appointed. The Ghanaian government, which holds a 20% stake and a golden share in Ashanti, has called for a meeting with shareholders this week to discuss ways forward for the problem-stricken group. The courts have ruled that Ashanti cannot enter into new financial transactions until after the meeting. But the company had been due to sign a $100m loan agreement last Thursday, and needs cash quickly to pay for work on the attractive Geita gold project in Tanzania. It aims to sell a 50% stake there to raise money in the future. Ashanti has blamed its financial difficulties on a sudden rise in the gold price following the announcement in September that 15 central banks had decided to limit sales of gold into the market. The gold price rose $86 in the next 11 days while Ashanti's hedge book was geared to prices continuing a steady decline. Other gold producers have seen their stocks hit by the price spike but Ashanti's margin-free limits were lower than its peers in north America because of its Ghanaian base. Ashanti's woes also hit Lonmin, Britain's fourth biggest mining company and Africa's third biggest platinum producer, which owns 32% of Ashanti.

      "bodyText": "The future of Airbus, the European aircraft-maker, came under a renewed cloud yesterday when BAE Systems threatened to veto a top-level executive appointment. The European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (Eads), being formed from the merger of France's Aerospatiale Matra, Germany's Dasa and Spain's Casa, overrode BAE's objections and named Noel Forgeard as head of its Airbus operations. Mr Forgeard is already chief executive of the four-nation consortium running Airbus, and BAE made plain that his proposed dual role created an immediate conflict of interest. BAE, which has a 20% stake in the consortium compared with the 80% holding controlled by Eads, is determined to resist Franco-German efforts to push it into accepting a new corporate structure for Airbus. The row is the latest in a series of tensions between BAE and its European partners since the British group walked out of a proposed marriage with Dasa in December 1998 and took as its merger partner the Marconi defence business of the then GEC. That prompted Manfred Bischoff, the Dasa chief executive now set to become co-chairman of Eads, to refuse point-blank to talk with John Weston, BAE chief executive, for several months. Relations, though now formally cordial, have scarcely improved since. Mr Forgeard's nomination as chief executive of Eads' Airbus division came as Dr Bischoff and Jean-Luc Lagard\u00e8re, his co-chairman, named 52 top managers to run the company - if and when its formation is approved by regulators. Eads will have two chief executives, Philippe Camus, Aerospatiale Matra's current chief, and Rainer Hertrich, now in charge at Dasa. They will be based in Paris and Munich respectively. The management structure - 25 French, 23 German and four Spanish executives but, officially without any national quota - was greeted by British industry sources as \"a complete dog's breakfast\" that Anglo-Saxon shareholders would throw out and \"a typical Franco-German political fudge\". There was ridicule that Eads, in its official communiqu\u00e9 posted in Amsterdam where it is to be incorporated, said: \"Eads will have an integrated central organisation with functions in Amsterdam, Madrid, Munich and Paris.\" But it was Mr Forgeard's dual role that prompted quiet rage, even though BAE sources went out of their way to stress that discussions continued with a view to finding a solution. \"This is not a closed subject.

BAE, which makes the wings for the Airbus fleet, is seeking a bigger stake in the eventual company because it contributes up to 30% of profits.

      "body": "<p>It could be a Sherlock Holmes story - The Mystery of the Phantom Stores. Last week culture secretary Chris Smith proudly told the Guardian that museums are opening their jealously guarded storerooms to the public, with the Tate Gallery leading the way. </p> <p>\"Under our access schemes, anyone can go down to the Tate's warehouse and rummage around,\" said the minister.Yet call the Tate demanding to exercise your right of access and you'll be told that, while the Tate does indeed have a \"fantastic new storage space\" in south London, which curators \"hope in due course people will be able to visit\", this is not possible at the moment. </p> <p>The department of culture, media and sport had \"absolutely no idea\" of the confusion's source. Instead they offered other examples of good practice: the Museum of London is sending objects in boxes to school programmes; various community groups are being encouraged to delve into the stores of Newcastle's Laing Art Gallery. </p> <p>The opening of museum stores is one of a raft of proposals to improve access in a policy paper issued by the DCMS last year. Museums for the Many says that museums directly funded by the department must set targets for access in their new three-year funding agreements. </p> <p>There's nothing new here. If you want to see backstage at the Science Museum, you can book a visit to its stores at Wroughton, an airfield on the outskirts of Swindon, where hangars hold a treasure trove of engineering history. The site dates back to the 70s. When the Tate stores were at Millbank they could be visited on request - so it's ironic that the Tate is currently alone among major London museums in not rushing to open its stores to the public. </p> <p>The V&amp;A has its own plans to open public-access stores at Wroughton, and guarantees anyone can see any objects in its collection on request. National museums are gradually moving their collections out of shared storage at Blythe House to more public facilities.

      "bodyText": "It could be a Sherlock Holmes story - The Mystery of the Phantom Stores. Last week culture secretary Chris Smith proudly told the Guardian that museums are opening their jealously guarded storerooms to the public, with the Tate Gallery leading the way. \"Under our access schemes, anyone can go down to the Tate's warehouse and rummage around,\" said the minister.Yet call the Tate demanding to exercise your right of access and you'll be told that, while the Tate does indeed have a \"fantastic new storage space\" in south London, which curators \"hope in due course people will be able to visit\", this is not possible at the moment. The department of culture, media and sport had \"absolutely no idea\" of the confusion's source. Instead they offered other examples of good practice: the Museum of London is sending objects in boxes to school programmes; various community groups are being encouraged to delve into the stores of Newcastle's Laing Art Gallery. The opening of museum stores is one of a raft of proposals to improve access in a policy paper issued by the DCMS last year. Museums for the Many says that museums directly funded by the department must set targets for access in their new three-year funding agreements. There's nothing new here. If you want to see backstage at the Science Museum, you can book a visit to its stores at Wroughton, an airfield on the outskirts of Swindon, where hangars hold a treasure trove of engineering history. The site dates back to the 70s. When the Tate stores were at Millbank they could be visited on request - so it's ironic that the Tate is currently alone among major London museums in not rushing to open its stores to the public. The V&amp;A has its own plans to open public-access stores at Wroughton, and guarantees anyone can see any objects in its collection on request. National museums are gradually moving their collections out of shared storage at Blythe House to more public facilities. In 2003 the British Museum is to open a new study centre in a former Bloomsbury post office to make its vast collection of artefacts more accessible. The real mystery is not why the Tate has not opened its stores, but why the others have. Museums have a double function: they are centres of display and places of conservation. Do the roles really need to be integrated?

      "body": "<p>The flying saucer lies on the gallery floor like a gigantic infant's discarded toy. Next to it is a huge zeppelin, a bloated, patched and discoloured envelope of air, wedged between floor and ceiling, taking up almost an entire room in the Hayward Gallery. It appears to have been uncomfortably inserted into the space like a vast, nightmarish suppository. An air-pump keeps the thing inflated, but it isn't going anywhere. Nor is the spaceship, nor any of the other flying machines, hovercrafts, back-pack levitation devices and solar-powered prehistoric birds, in this first British survey of the work of Panamarenko, one of Belgium's leading artists. </p> <p>One might, uncharitably, think of Panamarenko as an entertainer, a sort of continental Heath-Robinson, but that would be a mistake. This singular artist, whose work is influenced by the poetics of the great avant-gardist Marcel Broodthaers and the idealistic notions of Joseph Beuys, has, since the 60s, been preoccupied by ideas of escape. In a way, he is a real-life equivalent of Russian artist Ilya Kabakov's fictional character, who dreamt of escaping the confines of his wretched Moscow flat, constructing a craft from the things he had about him. Panamarenko also recalls those Colditz prisoners who hoped to escape in a glider built from paper, cocoa tins and stolen scraps. </p> <p>A self-styled \"artist/technologist\" who long ago abandoned his original name, Panamarenko lives and works in Antwerp. His pseudonym conflates Pan American Airlines with a Russian-sounding suffix, as though to weld together east and west. The word Panama also reminds us of the canal that links the Pacific to the Atlantic. But Panamarenko's aspirations go beyond the global: he envisions outer space as his next frontier. His flying saucer, however, is made of fibre-glass, and runs on compressed air. Nasa does not call him for advice. </p> <p>Surrounded by his experimental machines and a flock of parrots, Panamarenko dreams of flight but rarely travels outside the city of his birth. It's a Belgian thing, according to Jon Thompson, curator of the Hayward's show. Another of Belgium's foremost (and equally reclusive) artists, Thierry de Cordier, appears to want to bury himself in the dark, damp earth. </p> <p>Out on one of the top-floor sculpture courts, a submarine squats in the sunshine, the London Eye slowly turning behind it. What is the submarine doing up here? Maybe Panamarenko has anticipated a greater rise in the sea level than global warming suggests. Like all his machines, the submarine looks as if it ought to work and is clearly the product of thousands of hours of labour. The stubby body, though, appears too small for the conning tower. \"It has to have a conning tower that size,\" its inventor has said, \"so that no one who saw it coming would think that it was only as big as a kitchen.\" </p> <p>Panamarenko is one of art's - and nature's - originals. His fantasies of gravity-defying, pedal-powered flight, of electromagnetic levitation, of lawnmower-engine powered jet propulsion, have driven most of his working life. He's been trying to get off the ground since the mid-60s. His failure is, at least in part, intended and ironical. His is a tragicomic aspiration. His earliest machine was bicycle-powered. Beckett's Molloy travelled by bike (though he wasn't really going anywhere), and Godot, who never arrives, was named after a Tour de France cyclist. There's a thesis in there somewhere. </p> <p>Panamarenko sometimes dresses in an ill-fitting military garb. His hat is on display at the Hayward: a Soviet-looking kepi with a badge bearing the artist's name. He's painted the top of the cap in gold, and on it rest two little plastic trout. \"With a hat like this you could enter the best hotel and they would immediately give you the best suite,\" Panamarenko once said. \"I know because I have tried it.\" </p> <p>Panamarenko seems so laden with eccentricities, and his work so wayward, that one is more than merely amused. There is something awesome about him. He has his own theories of physics - mish-mashes of Newton, Einstein, quantum mechanics, ironical wit and gobbledygook. But before you dismiss him as a dotty \"character\" or a mad professor, remember that Newton never lost his interest in alchemy, and suffered a monumental crack-up; that Einstein cultivated a somewhat eccentric persona; and that some of the terms of quantum physics come from James Joyce's Finnegans Wake. </p> <p>Call his machines what you will - sculptures, utopian models, proposals, follies - they reflect a will to succeed. Yet their failure is certain. Take his balsa-wood, one-man V1 rocket, of which he says \"This is the fastest way to get to New York_ you would have to wear goggles, otherwise your eyes would be gouged out by the force of the speed\". Or the Flymo-engine powered back-packs, which would almost certainly burn the wearer to death, or propel him forcefully into the ground. The Aeromodeller, that vast zeppelin-shaped balloon, with its wickerwork basket and asbestos suits, was originally designed as an airborne house that would impress Brigitte Bardot when it landed on her front lawn and whisked her away from the paparazzi. </p> <p> Panamarenko admits that the earliest work in the exhibition, Das Flugzeug, which he made just after he left art school in 1967, isn't successful. A racing bike's pedals, handlebars and seat are positioned in the middle of long steel tubes, held together with gaffer tape. The pedals power two sets of propellers, held in place by a filigree of wires. The handlebars are set low to prevent the rider being decapitated. Das Flugzeug takes up an entire gallery. It is delicate, beautiful and utterly impractical. \"I discovered all that stuff about art being an unconscious thing,\" said Panamarenko. \"You thought that something was great but you didn't know why. I think this aeroplane is great but I don't know why.\" </p> <p>I think it's great too, and I don't know why either. It's useless. It'll never get off the ground by pedal-power alone. Only a supreme act of mental will could get it airborne. This is the point, I think. </p> <p>The exhibition is exhilarating, alarming and frustrating. Exhilarating because Panamarenko's inventions are so charming, so clunky, so very nearly plausible. Alarming because of both the effort that has gone into their construction, and their inherent mechanical dangers. Frustrating, because nothing works, nothing moves. None of the devices are set in motion. No records of his attempts at flight, no test-bed films of his machines actually working, however disastrously, are in the show. We can watch a couple of videos of Panamarenko lecturing before a blackboard, in Flemish, but these excerpts unhinge his claims to science, as he grapples, incoherently and unpersuasively, with his very personal take on the laws of physics. </p> <p>A few years ago I saw Panamarenko's solar-powered Archaeopterix perched on a tree trunk in the Middelheim sculpture park on the outskirts of Antwerp. As I approached the trunk, something seemed to be scrabbling and jumping about on it. It was a mechanical prehistoric chicken, programmed to leap into life when anyone approached, activated by a sensor buried in the trunk. Every time the weather turned nasty, one of the park staff had to run out of their shed to rescue the poor creature from the rain. </p> <p>This encounter with Panamarenko's imagination was wonderful, and a little scary. Some of these solar-powered creatures are in the Hayward, but they're lifeless, static, pinned down by little vices and clamps. </p> <p>In his illuminating essay in the exhibition catalogue, Jon Thompson invokes Pieter Bruegel the Elder's Icarus, distantly crashing into the sea, unnoticed by the ploughman on the cliff-top. We look on from a slightly elevated position, as though we ourselves were levitating, seeing everything. As though, in fact, the entire world were within our compass. It is a haunting, dream-like painting, in which we are given a kind of omnipotence. Everyone dreams of flying. We've all had nightmares of falling.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It is close to midnight and Gerard Schwarz has had a tough week. But you would never know it. Immaculately dressed and sipping a brandy, he rattles off the reasons he has taken on Liverpool's ailing orchestra. He was originally a trumpet player from New York - and you can't get much lippier than that. </p> <p>Like almost every British regional orchestra, the Royal Liverpool Phil harmonic has had a sticky few years. Its deficit stands at \u00a32.5m and, according to spokesman Ed Jones, \"had it not been for an understanding bank manager, we might easily have gone under\". Audiences average 75-80% but are in gentle decline, and attracting younger concertgoers is proving tricky. </p> <p>The outgoing music director, Petr Altrichter, can't be blamed for the deficit - its origins lie further back than his arrival in 1996. But he has not proved popular and - an odd complaint, perhaps - has been deemed too preoccupied with the music. Liverpool is seeking a conductor who offers vision as well as sound. </p> <p>Enter Schwarz, who was last week named as the RLPO's new music director and hence chief conductor. Does he mind the management presenting him as a sort of corporate executive? \"Orchestras hire a music director for their ability to conduct,\" he says. \"But a music director has a lot of other responsibilities: dealing with the personnel, dealing with guest conductors and guest soloists, building a season, dealing with the orchestra's position in its community. If you're not willing to take them on, you shouldn't take the job.\" </p> <p>Schwarz, 52, was first trumpet with the New York Philharmonic under Bernstein and Boulez, but left in the 70s to concentrate on conducting. \"I loved playing and I was pretty good,\" he says, \"but it wasn't what I ultimately wanted to do with my life.\" </p> <p>He has transformed the Seattle Symphony Orchestra, where he has been music director for the past 15 years. \"When I went to Seattle, there was a lot of work to do,\" says Schwarz. \"The city was not particularly affluent or cultured. The Seattle Symphony was a decent orchestra, but it didn't have a very strong staff or a strong board. But it had the makings of a first-class orchestra. Now Seattle is the richest city in the country and the orchestra is phenomenal. We have a great hall, and a recital hall, and do 150 concerts a year. Ticket sales are 92% of capacity and next year our ticket income will be $9m. What's happened is a miracle.\" </p> <p>How does Liverpool compare? \"It's a little better placed than Seattle was 15 years ago,\" says Schwarz. \"Everyone in Liverpool is on the same path and they are open to almost anything.\" </p> <p>Even sackings? \"I don't do that,\" he insists. \"In all my time in Seattle I've fired two people. I've moved a few people around and encouraged a lot of retirements, but I'm not a firer. You work with the people you have.\" </p> <p>Schwarz has run the summer Mozart festival at New York's Lincoln Center for the past 20 years and, more recently, spent time in Japan with the Tokyo Philharmonic. His stint with Tokyo has now ended and next year he relinquishes the Mozart festival, leaving him commuting between Seattle and Liverpool, where he will spend 14 weeks a year. </p> <p>Is that enough to make a difference? \"It's a lot of presence,\" he says. \"If you're there too much, it would drive everybody crazy. Conductors need to get out of town - Karajan said that. But I will be involved the whole time and I'll shape the programme. If you don't like the programme, blame me; if you don't like the soloists or the guest conductor, it's my fault, even if I'm not there.\" </p> <p>So what are the priorities? \"Financial stabilisation is crucial. We have to raise our earned income and make sure the community sees us as an important part of civic life. I want to make it possible to do concerts at different times, on weekday afternoons say, to attract people who can't get to evening concerts.\" </p> <p>There will also be occasional pay-what-you-can concerts for those unable to afford the \u00a310-\u00a315 ticket prices. \"Every once in a while you have to give back to your community,\" he says. \"You have to say, 'We love you and we want you to know that we are not an elite organisation.' \"</p>",

The outgoing music director, Petr Altrichter, can't be blamed for the deficit - its origins lie further back than his arrival in 1996. But he has not proved popular and - an odd complaint, perhaps - has been deemed too preoccupied with the music. Liverpool is seeking a conductor who offers vision as well as sound. Enter Schwarz, who was last week named as the RLPO's new music director and hence chief conductor. Does he mind the management presenting him as a sort of corporate executive? \"Orchestras hire a music director for their ability to conduct,\" he says. \"But a music director has a lot of other responsibilities: dealing with the personnel, dealing with guest conductors and guest soloists, building a season, dealing with the orchestra's position in its community. If you're not willing to take them on, you shouldn't take the job.\" Schwarz, 52, was first trumpet with the New York Philharmonic under Bernstein and Boulez, but left in the 70s to concentrate on conducting. \"I loved playing and I was pretty good,\" he says, \"but it wasn't what I ultimately wanted to do with my life.\" He has transformed the Seattle Symphony Orchestra, where he has been music director for the past 15 years. \"When I went to Seattle, there was a lot of work to do,\" says Schwarz. \"The city was not particularly affluent or cultured. The Seattle Symphony was a decent orchestra, but it didn't have a very strong staff or a strong board. But it had the makings of a first-class orchestra. Now Seattle is the richest city in the country and the orchestra is phenomenal. We have a great hall, and a recital hall, and do 150 concerts a year. Ticket sales are 92% of capacity and next year our ticket income will be $9m. What's happened is a miracle.\" How does Liverpool compare? \"It's a little better placed than Seattle was 15 years ago,\" says Schwarz. \"Everyone in Liverpool is on the same path and they are open to almost anything.\" Even sackings? \"I don't do that,\" he insists. \"In all my time in Seattle I've fired two people. I've moved a few people around and encouraged a lot of retirements, but I'm not a firer. You work with the people you have.\" Schwarz has run the summer Mozart festival at New York's Lincoln Center for the past 20 years and, more recently, spent time in Japan with the Tokyo Philharmonic. His stint with Tokyo has now ended and next year he relinquishes the Mozart festival, leaving him commuting between Seattle and Liverpool, where he will spend 14 weeks a year. Is that enough to make a difference? \"It's a lot of presence,\" he says. \"If you're there too much, it would drive everybody crazy. Conductors need to get out of town - Karajan said that. But I will be involved the whole time and I'll shape the programme. If you don't like the programme, blame me; if you don't like the soloists or the guest conductor, it's my fault, even if I'm not there.\" So what are the priorities? \"Financial stabilisation is crucial. We have to raise our earned income and make sure the community sees us as an important part of civic life. I want to make it possible to do concerts at different times, on weekday afternoons say, to attract people who can't get to evening concerts.\" There will also be occasional pay-what-you-can concerts for those unable to afford the \u00a310-\u00a315 ticket prices. \"Every once in a while you have to give back to your community,\" he says. \"You have to say, 'We love you and we want you to know that we are not an elite organisation.' \"",

      "body": "<p>Was music a major part of your life when you were a child? Yes, it was an obsession. My mother played the piano and my father was a tenor; my mother also played the cornet in father's band. I had piano lessons from the age of six, which I didn't like to start with. But gradually I became obsessed: my parents were very religious and the piano became an inner world I could escape into. I hadn't thought about composing then; I was fascinated by the sounds but I didn't know how to put them together, and certainly never knew how to write them down. </p> <p>From the age of nine I was writing pieces, and improvising before that. I used to pretend to my parents that I was playing the pieces that were set, but really I was improvising and distorting them. That's how I discovered composition, by distorting other people's music out of boredom. </p> <p>None of my early pieces (they were very ambitious - symphonies and concertos) made sense. I remember they had lots of notes - nothing's changed in that way! I had a list of the works I wanted to write in the future - I was obsessed with the idea of being a composer. You can imagine that coming from a fairly working-class background, the idea of being a composer was very strange - certainly to my school friends. Not to my parents, they were very supportive. But I had a lot of resistance from school; I had a music teacher who was very dismissive, but I was determined. </p> <p><strong>What did you hear at home? </strong><br> My mother listened to Beethoven, the symphonies and concertos. That's what I grew up with, as well as Haydn and Mozart. I bought records when I was quite young, before I started composing, and I became fascinated by the lives of the composers. I had my Top Ten - my school-friends thought I was very eccentric - I remember Nielsen was number one at one stage; later it was Shostakovich. I was about 11 then. I didn't know anything about pop music; obviously there were The Beatles but my parents considered them... evil is too strong a word, but their music was thought to be corrupting, and so I never listened to it. </p> <p>I listened to Radio 3 continually. There was loads of contemporary music broadcast then. I was resistant to it at first, but it's how I got to know about composers like Stockhausen. My musical education at school was so poor I thought I could learn much more by listening to the radio. </p> <p><strong> At the age of 14 you were accepted by the junior department of the Royal College of Music. When did you begin to study with Oliver Knussen? </strong><br> After I had been there about a year my composition teacher left, and I received a card that just said, \"You're studying with Oliver Knussen.\" I thought this was fantastic - he was a composer I'd actually heard of. He was astonished because I had recognised him and that immediately started our friendship. Olly had to do a lot to instil confidence in me. </p> <p>Without Olly's brilliant teaching, I would never have written Night Dances. People ask me how I was able to write such an assured orchestral piece when I was 20; well, that's because of Olly. Even now, I take new pieces to him and he knows instinctively what works in my music. </p> <p><strong> By the time you wrote Night Dances you were studying full-time at the RCM, weren't you? </strong><br> Yes. During that time too I was discovering another type of music, which actually was pretty much peculiar to Essex, where there was an incredible following for fusion. It's very much black American fusion - Herbie Hancock, Freddie Hubbard, Donald Byrd. At the other extreme, there was soul as well - Funkadelic, George Clinton. It was a really rich time, but I think if I'd been living in Somerset, for instance, it would never have happened. </p> <p><strong> When did you discover Miles Davis? </strong><br> That was later. I found out about Miles Davis through Herbie Hancock; I'd probably heard a few things by Miles, and so I went back to Kind of Blue. I didn't actually know about Bitch's Brew, although the things I was listening to were more close to Bitch's Brew. I was listening to all this but of course my music sounded nothing like it, though jazz obviously did find its way in, because the second movement of Night Dances is a tribute to Davis. </p> <p>I then became obsessed with this music. Those influences are still there in my music because it was a key time in my development. </p> <p><strong> You composed your opera Greek between 1986 and 1988. How long had you wanted to write an opera? </strong><br> I didn't want to write an opera at all. I agreed with Pierre Boulez about burning down opera houses. I had a real antipathy to it from my background. I'd seen some opera - I think I saw La Boh\u00e8me on a school trip - I just found it irritating. I needed to be persuaded by composer Hans Werner Henze to write Greek. </p> <p>It's always so hard to find subject matter for an opera, really almost impossible. Henze's first suggestion was that I look at Edward Bond's The Pope's Wedding. I was a bit nervous and so it took me quite a while to write to such a famous writer. He didn't reply immediately, so I gave up and approached Steven Berkoff. Berkoff did reply, saying that he thought Greek was the most operatic of his works. I wasn't convinced at first but the more I got submerged in the project the more convinced I became. </p> <p><strong> How did you set about adapting the text of Greek?</strong><br> I just got stuck into cutting Berkoff's play and setting the lines almost as soon as I'd cut them. It was a strange way of working. Greek is a very wordy play, and the language is unbelievable - the opera libretto's tame by comparison. I had to match that language, that extraordinary combination of Shakespeare, colloquial English and cockney, and the sort of seaside humour that suddenly becomes incredibly lyrical. But I was so terrified of writing an opera; the very word scared me and almost made me freeze up. So I tried to fool myself - I remember thinking, well, I'll just begin it; I'll mess around, I'll do the pub scene at the beginning, and this won't be in the final version. The football rhythm at the beginning - it's not from BBC Grandstand as a lot of people think, incidentally, it's actually from ITV's World of Sport from years ago - I thought was just too ridiculous and that I couldn't possibly use it in the opera, but I just put it in because I was having fun. Basically I tried to relax. And of course the rhythm did end up in the final version. </p> <p>I wanted the score to be direct and I felt too that all the bad language couldn't be set to music. I think it's ridiculous when you hear it set elaborately by certain composers. You have to figure out another way of dealing with it. So there is a lot of speech in Greek, which I wouldn't do now. </p> <p> <strong>You received the commission for The Silver Tassie from English National Opera in 1989, so when did you find the subject you wanted? Had you already fixed on that Sean O'Casey play before you began working with librettist Amanda Holden? </strong></p> <p>I thought The Silver Tassie was remarkable, especially the second act, which is set in the trenches of the first world war. But I sat on the idea for a year before I met Amanda Holden. She gave me the confidence to think that this project could work. </p> <p> <strong>Presumably you realised at an early stage that The Silver Tassie would have to be a very different kind of opera from Greek - much bigger in scale?</strong><br> Yes. If I'm really honest, I was disappointed when I first got the commission for Greek that I was only allowed an ensemble of 18 players. But for The Silver Tassie I felt that it would be great to write something that made a big noise on stage - hence I was attracted to using a male chorus in the second act. I love Benjamin Britten's opera Peter Grimes, especially the section when the villagers are shouting out his name, and I had seen all those big shows at ENO like Britten's Grimes, Billy Budd and Shostakovich's Lady Macbeth, which were very impressive, so I thought, yes, if I'm going to do another opera it's going to be big. </p> <p>\u0095 The Silver Tassie opens at the London Coliseum tomorrow.

      "body": "<p>It has no sex, no stars and it was made without even using a camera. Toy Story 2, the computer-animated film that broke all the Hollywood rules, topped the charts yesterday after the biggest weekend in British box office history. </p> <p>The adventures of Woody, Buzz Lightyear and the dumb dinosaur Rex surpassed Star Wars: The Phantom Menace - the most hyped film of all time - and put the biggest human star on the planet in the shade, too. </p> <p>Leonardo DiCaprio may have brought hundreds of screaming fans out on to the streets of London last week for the premiere of The Beach, but it made less than one-third of the \u00a37.75m that Toy Story 2 took in its first three days. Toy Story 2's performance was all the more astonishing because most of those who went to see it were children, paying only half price. </p> <p>The Beach's strong showing, based on the twin appeal of the \"dream team\" of DiCaprio and Trainspotting director Danny Boyle, plus a bevy of new \"British\" films led by American Beauty and The End of the Affair, helped to push the total weekend take to a record-breaking \u00a314.2m. That is more than \u00a31m up on the previous high, when cinemagoers queued to see the no-budget horror film The Blair Witch Project at Halloween. </p> <p>It has been a terrific week for British films, with no fewer than six movies in the top 10 either shot here or made by homegrown film-makers - The Beach, American Beauty, The End of the Affair, Angela's Ashes, Sleepy Hollow and East is East. </p> <p>Mary Scott, of Screen International, who compiles the figures, said that even allowing for the period covering half-term in many schools, the statistics were staggering. </p> <p>\"It's just amazing how Toy Story 2 has crossed over,\" she said. \"To get such figures it can't just be children - adults must be going as well. </p> <p>\"It's a unique film in many ways, not least in being a sequel that is even better than the original.\" </p> <p>Toy Story was the first computer-animated feature film, and Toy Story 2 is another technological first, with digital projecters being used to show it. </p> <p>Already they are plans for a second sequel which will pick up from where Buzz Lightyear, the superhero with a 40-watt intellect, rescues his cowpoke buddy Woody from the clutches of an evil toy collector. </p> <p>\"It's a landmark in many ways,\" said Ms Scott. \"It's just a good film. People really like it. On any other week, The Beach would have topped the charts on what it did this weekend.\" </p> <p>While Toy Story 2 has just sneaked into the American all-time 20 top-grossing films, it still has a long way to go to match the success of Stars Wars and Titanic. </p> <p>But it has one big advantage on them, said Scott: \"It's far shorter, so cinemas can squeeze in seven or eight showings a day while they could only get in maybe five of Titanic.\" </p> <p><strong>Best performances</strong></p> <p><strong> 1 Toy Story 2</strong> \u00a37.75m </p> <p><strong> 2 The Beach</strong> \u00a32.41m </p> <p><strong> 3 American Beauty</strong> \u00a31.65m </p> <p><strong> 4 The End of the Affair</strong> \u00a3754,419 </p> <p><strong> 5 House on Haunted Hill</strong> \u00a3547,879 </p> <p><strong> 6 Double Jeopardy</strong> \u00a3414,946 </p> <p><strong> 7 Angela's Ashes</strong> \u00a3229,347 </p> <p><strong> 8 Sleepy Hollow</strong> \u00a3132,703 </p> <p><strong> 9 The Sixth Sense</strong> \u00a3128,028 </p> <p><strong> 10 East is East</strong> \u00a3111,337 </p> <p> (Source: Screen International)</p>",

      "bodyText": "It has no sex, no stars and it was made without even using a camera. Toy Story 2, the computer-animated film that broke all the Hollywood rules, topped the charts yesterday after the biggest weekend in British box office history. The adventures of Woody, Buzz Lightyear and the dumb dinosaur Rex surpassed Star Wars: The Phantom Menace - the most hyped film of all time - and put the biggest human star on the planet in the shade, too. Leonardo DiCaprio may have brought hundreds of screaming fans out on to the streets of London last week for the premiere of The Beach, but it made less than one-third of the \u00a37.75m that Toy Story 2 took in its first three days. Toy Story 2's performance was all the more astonishing because most of those who went to see it were children, paying only half price. The Beach's strong showing, based on the twin appeal of the \"dream team\" of DiCaprio and Trainspotting director Danny Boyle, plus a bevy of new \"British\" films led by American Beauty and The End of the Affair, helped to push the total weekend take to a record-breaking \u00a314.2m. That is more than \u00a31m up on the previous high, when cinemagoers queued to see the no-budget horror film The Blair Witch Project at Halloween. It has been a terrific week for British films, with no fewer than six movies in the top 10 either shot here or made by homegrown film-makers - The Beach, American Beauty, The End of the Affair, Angela's Ashes, Sleepy Hollow and East is East. Mary Scott, of Screen International, who compiles the figures, said that even allowing for the period covering half-term in many schools, the statistics were staggering. \"It's just amazing how Toy Story 2 has crossed over,\" she said. \"To get such figures it can't just be children - adults must be going as well. \"It's a unique film in many ways, not least in being a sequel that is even better than the original.\" Toy Story was the first computer-animated feature film, and Toy Story 2 is another technological first, with digital projecters being used to show it. Already they are plans for a second sequel which will pick up from where Buzz Lightyear, the superhero with a 40-watt intellect, rescues his cowpoke buddy Woody from the clutches of an evil toy collector. \"It's a landmark in many ways,\" said Ms Scott. \"It's just a good film. People really like it. On any other week, The Beach would have topped the charts on what it did this weekend.\" While Toy Story 2 has just sneaked into the American all-time 20 top-grossing films, it still has a long way to go to match the success of Stars Wars and Titanic. But it has one big advantage on them, said Scott: \"It's far shorter, so cinemas can squeeze in seven or eight showings a day while they could only get in maybe five of Titanic.\" Best performances 1 Toy Story 2 \u00a37.75m 2 The Beach \u00a32.41m 3 American Beauty \u00a31.65m 4 The End of the Affair \u00a3754,419 5 House on Haunted Hill \u00a3547,879 6 Double Jeopardy \u00a3414,946 7 Angela's Ashes \u00a3229,347 8 Sleepy Hollow \u00a3132,703 9 The Sixth Sense \u00a3128,028 10 East is East \u00a3111,337 (Source: Screen International)",

For someone tackling only his second opera it is a real ordeal by fire, and one that has badly burnt the Catalan director Calixto Bieito at Welsh National Opera. His production of Calderon's Life is a Dream, at the Edinburgh Festival two summers ago, suggested that Bieito's eye for theatrical imagery and sense of dramatic pacing might be powerfully transferred to the operatic stage. However, this Cosi Fan Tutte turns out to be a horrible disappointment, a disaster partially redeemed by the dependable conducting of Robert Spano and promising performances from some of the principals. Bieito has new shows (Don Giovanni and A Masked Ball) scheduled at English National Opera in coming seasons; they will need to be far, far better. </p> <p>Bieito's inadequate response to the almost insoluble dramatic problems of Cosi - the debatably effective disguises; the emotional switchback that the two pairs of lovers experience; the ambiguous conclusion - is to turn everything into a brittle, hyperactive romp. He dodges the challenge of the ending by playing the final ensemble in front of the curtain, with no one relating to anyone else, or giving a hint of how these strange events might have changed their relationships. </p> <p>Alfons Flores's handsome set places the action in a present-day Italian bar, with mirrored back wall and lots of chrome chairs and tables; these, and the unremarkably contemporary costumes (by Merc\u00e9 Paloma), provide plenty of opportunity for distracting business. When extras aren't re-arranging furniture, the protagonists are rearranging each other's clothes: some of Mozart's most beguiling numbers are sung against a counterpoint of fumbling hands and awkward unbuttonings. </p> <p>Bieito renders everyone pretty repellent.

      "bodyText": "Mozart's troubling comedy of manners is an exacting test for the most experienced of operatic hands. For someone tackling only his second opera it is a real ordeal by fire, and one that has badly burnt the Catalan director Calixto Bieito at Welsh National Opera. His production of Calderon's Life is a Dream, at the Edinburgh Festival two summers ago, suggested that Bieito's eye for theatrical imagery and sense of dramatic pacing might be powerfully transferred to the operatic stage. However, this Cosi Fan Tutte turns out to be a horrible disappointment, a disaster partially redeemed by the dependable conducting of Robert Spano and promising performances from some of the principals. Bieito has new shows (Don Giovanni and A Masked Ball) scheduled at English National Opera in coming seasons; they will need to be far, far better. Bieito's inadequate response to the almost insoluble dramatic problems of Cosi - the debatably effective disguises; the emotional switchback that the two pairs of lovers experience; the ambiguous conclusion - is to turn everything into a brittle, hyperactive romp. He dodges the challenge of the ending by playing the final ensemble in front of the curtain, with no one relating to anyone else, or giving a hint of how these strange events might have changed their relationships. Alfons Flores's handsome set places the action in a present-day Italian bar, with mirrored back wall and lots of chrome chairs and tables; these, and the unremarkably contemporary costumes (by Merc\u00e9 Paloma), provide plenty of opportunity for distracting business. When extras aren't re-arranging furniture, the protagonists are rearranging each other's clothes: some of Mozart's most beguiling numbers are sung against a counterpoint of fumbling hands and awkward unbuttonings. Bieito renders everyone pretty repellent. Ferrando and Guglielmo (Gregory Turay and Neal Davies) are simply macho and loutish young men; Dorabella and Fiordiligi (Imelda Drumm and Cara O'Sullivan) seem to be girls who want nothing out of life apart from a good time. Alfonso's misogyny is so caricatured in Donald Maxwell's ranting performance that you half expect him to turn into a serial killer.

If the events of Cosi Fan Tutte are turned into nothing more than an opportunity for a bit of extra-mural groping and none of the characters seems even momentarily sympathetic, the opera is hardly worth staging at all. \u0095 Further performances: tomorrow, February 19 and March 2 - box office, 01222 878889 - then touring",

      "bodyText": "Long hours and growing job insecurity have helped fuel an epidemic of workplace bullying, with one in four employees saying they have been bullied in the past five years, according to the first comprehensive survey of the problem, published yesterday. Almost half of employees have experienced or seen bullying and one in 10 say they have been bullied in the past six months, the study by Manchester university's institute of science and technology found - response rates significantly higher than elsewhere in Europe. The survey of 5,300 workers, the largest of its kind ever carried out, and supported by both the TUC and CBI, defined bullying as long-term and persistent negative behaviour, ranging from abuse, humiliation and ridicule to the imposition of unmanageable workloads, unreasonable deadlines and continual fault-finding. The authors, Cary Cooper and Helge Hoel, found that victims were spread across all levels from senior managers to shopfloor workers, but that 75% of bullies were managers. Bullying was reported to be most rife in teaching, the prison service, post and telecommunications and the performing arts, and worse in the public than private sector. The TUC general secretary, John Monks, called for \"zero tolerance\". John Cridland, human resources director of the CBI, described the extent of workplace bullying as morally unacceptable and bad for business because of its effect on morale, absenteeism, staff turnover and productivity. The Umist survey, funded by the British Occupational Health Research Foundation, estimated that victims took an extra seven days off a year compared with other workers. It also uncovered higher levels of physical and mental ill health among victims and even among those who had only witnessed bullying. One victim yesterday described how incessant bullying by a manager drove her out of her job in a software firm and landed her in hospital for three weeks with acute stress. \"The atmosphere at work was terrible,\" she said. \"She would yell and scream at us and undermine everything we did. We weren't able to take responsibility for our own work and we were never given any training. After two years of almost constant bullying, I just felt I couldn't take any more.\" Prof Cooper linked the higher incidence compared with other European countries to the growth of long hours, job insecurity and the effects of \"downsizing\" on workloads. \"Bullying then becomes a management style in the face of unmanageable workloads,\" he said, adding that overworked and overstressed managers were now replacing psychopathic bosses as the most common workplace bully. Typical bullying managers were identified as autocratic and divisive with a tendency to punish on an arbitrary basis. The authors recommended mechanisms for victims to report bullying without fear of retribution, effective procedures for dealing with complaints, training of managers, and stress audits to avoid work environments which contributed to bullying.",

      "body": "<p>Virginia Woolf, musing on militarism and fascism, famously said that as a woman she had \"no country\". No nation to defend, no country to die for. </p> <p>Isabel Wright's short, sharp shock of a play, The Waiting Room, extends this feminist perspective into the present day to look at the lives of two women caught in a modern military conflict. The location is unspecified (though atrocities in Kosovo are referred to in the programme notes), the external conflict serving only as an intense backdrop to their internal drama. This is the psychological torment of war as seen from the private, cramped space the women share. The atmosphere in their safe house is cell-like, with just a bed and a window; the relationship between the two women, Naomi (Anita Vettesse) and Marah (Vivienne de Caris) - a young woman and her dead lover's mother - is like that of prisoners forced together. </p> <p>They clash and spar, their differences magnified by their predicament. This is convincing writing, showing both women as unlikeably self-obsessed and equally deluded in their contrasting ways of coping. The younger woman dreams her lover is the best of men and still alive; she gets by through fantasising about \"men, food and the amazing bath I'll have\". Marah, with a weary realism about the evil that men do, is shut down, broken by it all, intolerant of hope. </p> <p>The drama is the fight between them, the furious, mad, suspicious way they behave with one another, and the gradual realisation that all they have is each other. At little over an hour, it is an uphill struggle to get that sense of locked-in, pent-up resentment but also absolute reliance running between them; it's also hard on a set that might be cramped and basic but, all in new wood, looks like a minimalist Ikea interior. There is also too much walking in circles in an I'm-on-the-verge-look-I'm-pulling-at-my-hair way. </p> <p>But by the end, this physical and mental torture feels real enough, as Marah reveals the secrets she knows. These are tragic and cruel but, cathartically, free the women from the tyranny of the past and present and maybe release them from the waiting room. A promising offering from this young playwright. </p> <p>\u0095 At the Paisley Arts Centre - box office, 0141-887 1010 - tonight.</p>",
