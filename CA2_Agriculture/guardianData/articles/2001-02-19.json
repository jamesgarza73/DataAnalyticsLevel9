Lee Hughes might have equalised as they threw in the kitchen sink. \" It was the only time in the second half I was really concerned,\" said Francis. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "byline": "David Lacey  at Highbury",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>If winning a league demands a consistent knack for cracking safe combinations then winning a cup is often all about the art of picking pockets. Certainly Arsenal are in the quarter-finals because in Sylvain Wiltord they have found the French answer to Jack Dawkins, the artful dodger. </p> <p>Yesterday Wiltord came off the bench here to score twice in the last quarter-hour and win a sixth-round tie that Chelsea briefly threatened to steal from under Arsenal's noses. With five goals in the competition so far Wiltord is fast becoming the talisman who could take Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's team over the Severn Bridge to this season's final in Cardiff. </p> <p>At times it was difficult to believe that Chelsea had come to Highbury as FA Cup holders. For much of the game they performed with the world-weary passivity of players who had long since given up the idea of winning even a raffle on the road. </p> <p>Chelsea's sole victory away from Stamford Bridge this season remains their fourth-round Cup win at Gillingham. Yesterday Claudio Ranieri sent out a team to contain Arsenal and by the time his attack had acquired the extra pace of Eidur Gudjohnsen and Jesper Gronkjaer it was merely to chase the game. </p> <p>Though Arsenal were well worth their victory Wenger will be relieved to have got away with having to pick a defence that, at least on paper, appeared to be made more of straw than bricks. With Martin Keown and Silvinho injured and Tony Adams suspended the Arsenal manager was forced to play Oleg Luzhny, a full-back, at centre-back alongside the ponderous Igor Stepanovs. </p> <p>At Dynamo Kiev Luzhny was called \"the horse\" and though it is not known if Latvians ever christened Stepanovs \"the cart\" the potential danger this pair faced in the speed of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink appeared Chelsea's best chance of taking an early grip on the tie. </p> <p>Ranieri, however, seemed more concerned initially with holding the opposition in midfield. Given Patrick Vieira's dominance between the penalty areas the Chelsea coach did have a case but with the suspended Ray Parlour another Arsenal absentee Ranieri might have done worse than start with Gronkjaer, especially on the form the Dane had shown against Manchester United a week earlier. </p> <p>The delayed introduction of Gudjohnsen also eased the pressure on Arsenal's odd couple at centre-back, a point emphasised when the Icelander struck a post with a bicycle kick two minutes after Hasselbaink had brought the scores level with the best goal of the afternoon. </p> <p>\"That was the turning point,\" Ranieri shrugged afterwards. \"If we had scored then I think we would have won. Arsenal would have been forced to come forward more and we would have hit them on the break.\" </p> <p>True perhaps, although the feeling persisted that Chelsea would have done better had their coach's second thoughts been his first. Then again the last two coaches to win the FA Cup at Chelsea, Ruud Gullit and Gianluca Vialli, have both been sacked so maybe Ranieri knew what he was doing. </p> <p>The way Wenger's players were consistently first to the ball and raced forward in large numbers to support an attack when they were not defending in depth did not suggest a team due to play a Champions League game against Lyon in midweek with a visit to Manchester United four days later. </p> <p>With Lauren feeding off Vieira and both looking to release Robert Pires on the left Chelsea were on the back foot from the outset and rather fortunate that Dennis Bergkamp had a goal disallowed in the second minute for a push after Pires had taken the ball off Albert Ferrer. Not until the approach of half-time did Chelsea achieve anything of note, if one can call bookings notable. </p> <p>Celestine Babayaro soured the game by fouling Fredrik Ljungberg and kicking out at Bergkamp. Dennis Wise then became involved in confrontations with Vieira and Pires which led to a minute or two of massed shoving before Hasselbaink, Wise and Thierry Henry were cautioned. </p> <p>\"I felt there were certain moments when a number of players were happy to stay on the pitch,\" Wenger observed diplomatically. \"They needed to put on boxing gloves,\" Ranieri smiled, but apparently did not see Babayaro taking a swing at Lauren. Fortunately for Babayaro neither did the referee Graham Barber. </p> <p>Having replaced Sam Dalla Bona, Gronkjaer's first significant act was to give away a penalty by pushing Lauren away from Henry's centre, Henry himself putting Arsenal ahead with the kick. Until then Chelsea had done nothing to suggest they might be capable of drawing level, but just past the hour Gustavo Poyet and Gudjohnsen worked the ball to Hasselbaink, who from the penalty arc beat David Seaman with a superb right-footed shot. </p> <p>Gudjohnsen's near-miss followed, whereupon Wenger replaced Pires with Wiltord, who proceeded to win the tie. In the 73rd minute he flicked a long ball from Stepanovs, which Marcel Desailly had failed to intercept, past the advancing Carlo Cudicini and in the 85th the dodger scored simply after Lauren had left Babayaro and Gronkjaer in all of a twist to set up the chance. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

For much of the game they performed with the world-weary passivity of players who had long since given up the idea of winning even a raffle on the road. Chelsea's sole victory away from Stamford Bridge this season remains their fourth-round Cup win at Gillingham. Yesterday Claudio Ranieri sent out a team to contain Arsenal and by the time his attack had acquired the extra pace of Eidur Gudjohnsen and Jesper Gronkjaer it was merely to chase the game. Though Arsenal were well worth their victory Wenger will be relieved to have got away with having to pick a defence that, at least on paper, appeared to be made more of straw than bricks. With Martin Keown and Silvinho injured and Tony Adams suspended the Arsenal manager was forced to play Oleg Luzhny, a full-back, at centre-back alongside the ponderous Igor Stepanovs. At Dynamo Kiev Luzhny was called \"the horse\" and though it is not known if Latvians ever christened Stepanovs \"the cart\" the potential danger this pair faced in the speed of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink appeared Chelsea's best chance of taking an early grip on the tie. Ranieri, however, seemed more concerned initially with holding the opposition in midfield. Given Patrick Vieira's dominance between the penalty areas the Chelsea coach did have a case but with the suspended Ray Parlour another Arsenal absentee Ranieri might have done worse than start with Gronkjaer, especially on the form the Dane had shown against Manchester United a week earlier. The delayed introduction of Gudjohnsen also eased the pressure on Arsenal's odd couple at centre-back, a point emphasised when the Icelander struck a post with a bicycle kick two minutes after Hasselbaink had brought the scores level with the best goal of the afternoon. \"That was the turning point,\" Ranieri shrugged afterwards. \"If we had scored then I think we would have won. Arsenal would have been forced to come forward more and we would have hit them on the break.\" True perhaps, although the feeling persisted that Chelsea would have done better had their coach's second thoughts been his first. Then again the last two coaches to win the FA Cup at Chelsea, Ruud Gullit and Gianluca Vialli, have both been sacked so maybe Ranieri knew what he was doing. The way Wenger's players were consistently first to the ball and raced forward in large numbers to support an attack when they were not defending in depth did not suggest a team due to play a Champions League game against Lyon in midweek with a visit to Manchester United four days later. With Lauren feeding off Vieira and both looking to release Robert Pires on the left Chelsea were on the back foot from the outset and rather fortunate that Dennis Bergkamp had a goal disallowed in the second minute for a push after Pires had taken the ball off Albert Ferrer. Not until the approach of half-time did Chelsea achieve anything of note, if one can call bookings notable. Celestine Babayaro soured the game by fouling Fredrik Ljungberg and kicking out at Bergkamp. Dennis Wise then became involved in confrontations with Vieira and Pires which led to a minute or two of massed shoving before Hasselbaink, Wise and Thierry Henry were cautioned. \"I felt there were certain moments when a number of players were happy to stay on the pitch,\" Wenger observed diplomatically. \"They needed to put on boxing gloves,\" Ranieri smiled, but apparently did not see Babayaro taking a swing at Lauren. Fortunately for Babayaro neither did the referee Graham Barber. Having replaced Sam Dalla Bona, Gronkjaer's first significant act was to give away a penalty by pushing Lauren away from Henry's centre, Henry himself putting Arsenal ahead with the kick. Until then Chelsea had done nothing to suggest they might be capable of drawing level, but just past the hour Gustavo Poyet and Gudjohnsen worked the ball to Hasselbaink, who from the penalty arc beat David Seaman with a superb right-footed shot. Gudjohnsen's near-miss followed, whereupon Wenger replaced Pires with Wiltord, who proceeded to win the tie. In the 73rd minute he flicked a long ball from Stepanovs, which Marcel Desailly had failed to intercept, past the advancing Carlo Cudicini and in the 85th the dodger scored simply after Lauren had left Babayaro and Gronkjaer in all of a twist to set up the chance. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>Labour's three-day rally in Glasgow at the weekend effectively launched the party's election campaign with a string of policy announcements designed to reassure Labour activists and the country that it is ready for a second term.</p> <p>Tony Blair and eight cabinet ministers set out plans for reforming public services, spreading prosperity and making the country a \"more civilised place\".</p> <p>Mr Blair highlighted policy initiatives on drugs, unemployment and paternity leave.</p> <p>Acknowledging that Labour still needs to do more on law and order, Mr Blair promised to create a register of hard drug dealers.</p> <p>Based on an idea first set out by the Scottish MP Derek Brown, he said the courts would have powers to place on a register anyone leaving prison and liable to deal in drugs.</p> <p>The register, which would not be available to the public, would help police keep track of suspects.</p> <p>The idea will be included in a package of proposals to tackle crime which will be published during the next fortnight. The home secretary, Jack Straw, told the conference there would be new rights for crime victims. He said they would be kept informed of the progress of their case through the courts and provided with explanations about the key decisions affecting them.</p> <p>He also promised to punish more effectively the 100,000 hard-core of persistent offenders \"with sentences which both properly take account of their offending record and do more to reduce reoffending when they return to the community\".</p> <p>On the unemployed, Mr Blair promised changes on the New Deal programme. He said: \"In future any jobless claimant will not just be expected to take work but also if they lack skills to take up a state offer to pay to improve their skills.</p> <p>\"As a condition of benefit we will establish basic skills tests for newly unemployed adults. We will pay for them to read, write and do basic maths\".</p> <p>The programme, in part modelled on the successful employment action zones, would be part of a wider drive to help the 7m adults with inadequate basic reading skills.</p> <p>Mr Blair also promised that paternity leave would be paid by the state. Two weeks pay is the likely amount on offer and it could be set at the same level as maternity pay, which is \u00a360.70 a week.</p> <p>The proposal will be condemned as another regulatory burden by business, but employers will be relieved that Mr Blair has rejected proposals that mothers should be able to return to their former employment with a statutory right to part-time work.</p> <p>In a separate speech the employment minister Tessa Jowell held out the prospect of a big increase in the provision of child care, admitting that at present there is only one place for every seven children aged under eight.</p> <p>She also presaged a drive on pay equality, drawing on figures showing that between a quarter and half of the pay gap between men and women is caused by \"employers' discrimination against women\".</p> <p>In a development which will lift the spirits of northern activists, John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, revealed that he had won the backing of Mr Blair to publish a green paper after the election setting out plans for elected regional assemblies in England. Mr Blair has been convinced that the regions can act as economic power houses and also raise, overall, British productivity.</p> <p>At present the regional development agencies in England are monitored by non-statutory and unelected groups of councillors working in regional chambers. The green paper is likely to propose that referendums on elected assemblies should be triggered either by these chambers or by a petition from a fixed proportion of the electorate within each region.</p> <p>He drew loud cheers when he said: \"Regional chambers are a start to decentralisation in the English regions. Our next step must be to deepen regional accountability.</p> <p>\"I believe the time is right to take the next steps to publish a green paper on empowering our regions to strengthen the accountability of regional chambers, and where people vote for it to move to directly elected regional assemblies.\"</p> <p>The move was welcomed by many northern councillors who will be crucial in getting out the core Labour vote at the coming election.</p> <p>Throughout the weekend ministers went out of their way to promise greater freedom to local councillors. The chancellor, Gordon Brown, even held out the prospect of 150 councils being given greater freedom to spend money, so long as they negotiated with the Treasury on a common set of targets.</p> <p>Efforts were also made to appease pensioners, many of whom were infuriated by the 75p rise in the state pension last year. Mr Prescott promised to equalise the age for concessionary fares, saying it would help an extra 1m people at 60 years of age.</p> <p>The health secretary Alan Milburn also highlighted measures likely to please NHS workers. Besides offering extra cash and new targets to cut down health inequalities between poor and rich, he said it was time to \"shift the centre of gravity to the NHS frontline\".</p> <p>He promised ward sisters would control ward budgets so that they would have \"the power to stop payments to privately run cleaning firms which are failing to keep our hospitals clean\".</p> <p>He said that as services improved, so more devolution would take hold. The best hospitals would be free to use extra cash to pay bonuses to the best teams of staff. Poor services would get cash to improve them.</p> <p>It was a consistent theme of ministers that after two years of tight spending controls at the start of Labour's first term, the benefits of extra cash were starting to flow.</p> <p>Mr Blair told his audience that his government had matured in office and he was proud that there had been no breakdown in the relationship between the party and government that had disfigured previous Labour administrations.</p> <p>\u0095 Debate Labour's record with Polly Toynbee and David Walker at 2pm today at theguardian.com</p>",

The register, which would not be available to the public, would help police keep track of suspects. The idea will be included in a package of proposals to tackle crime which will be published during the next fortnight. The home secretary, Jack Straw, told the conference there would be new rights for crime victims. He said they would be kept informed of the progress of their case through the courts and provided with explanations about the key decisions affecting them. He also promised to punish more effectively the 100,000 hard-core of persistent offenders \"with sentences which both properly take account of their offending record and do more to reduce reoffending when they return to the community\". On the unemployed, Mr Blair promised changes on the New Deal programme. He said: \"In future any jobless claimant will not just be expected to take work but also if they lack skills to take up a state offer to pay to improve their skills. \"As a condition of benefit we will establish basic skills tests for newly unemployed adults. We will pay for them to read, write and do basic maths\". The programme, in part modelled on the successful employment action zones, would be part of a wider drive to help the 7m adults with inadequate basic reading skills. Mr Blair also promised that paternity leave would be paid by the state. Two weeks pay is the likely amount on offer and it could be set at the same level as maternity pay, which is \u00a360.70 a week. The proposal will be condemned as another regulatory burden by business, but employers will be relieved that Mr Blair has rejected proposals that mothers should be able to return to their former employment with a statutory right to part-time work. In a separate speech the employment minister Tessa Jowell held out the prospect of a big increase in the provision of child care, admitting that at present there is only one place for every seven children aged under eight. She also presaged a drive on pay equality, drawing on figures showing that between a quarter and half of the pay gap between men and women is caused by \"employers' discrimination against women\". In a development which will lift the spirits of northern activists, John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, revealed that he had won the backing of Mr Blair to publish a green paper after the election setting out plans for elected regional assemblies in England. Mr Blair has been convinced that the regions can act as economic power houses and also raise, overall, British productivity. At present the regional development agencies in England are monitored by non-statutory and unelected groups of councillors working in regional chambers. The green paper is likely to propose that referendums on elected assemblies should be triggered either by these chambers or by a petition from a fixed proportion of the electorate within each region. He drew loud cheers when he said: \"Regional chambers are a start to decentralisation in the English regions. Our next step must be to deepen regional accountability. \"I believe the time is right to take the next steps to publish a green paper on empowering our regions to strengthen the accountability of regional chambers, and where people vote for it to move to directly elected regional assemblies.\" The move was welcomed by many northern councillors who will be crucial in getting out the core Labour vote at the coming election. Throughout the weekend ministers went out of their way to promise greater freedom to local councillors. The chancellor, Gordon Brown, even held out the prospect of 150 councils being given greater freedom to spend money, so long as they negotiated with the Treasury on a common set of targets. Efforts were also made to appease pensioners, many of whom were infuriated by the 75p rise in the state pension last year. Mr Prescott promised to equalise the age for concessionary fares, saying it would help an extra 1m people at 60 years of age. The health secretary Alan Milburn also highlighted measures likely to please NHS workers. Besides offering extra cash and new targets to cut down health inequalities between poor and rich, he said it was time to \"shift the centre of gravity to the NHS frontline\". He promised ward sisters would control ward budgets so that they would have \"the power to stop payments to privately run cleaning firms which are failing to keep our hospitals clean\". He said that as services improved, so more devolution would take hold. The best hospitals would be free to use extra cash to pay bonuses to the best teams of staff. Poor services would get cash to improve them. It was a consistent theme of ministers that after two years of tight spending controls at the start of Labour's first term, the benefits of extra cash were starting to flow. Mr Blair told his audience that his government had matured in office and he was proud that there had been no breakdown in the relationship between the party and government that had disfigured previous Labour administrations. \u0095 Debate Labour's record with Polly Toynbee and David Walker at 2pm today at theguardian.com",

The little-known rules, which came into force last Friday, were briefed to party activists during a series of behind-closed-doors training sessions at Labour's spring conference in Glasgow over the weekend. Under rules passed in the Political Parties Act, voters will be entitled to a postal vote without having to meet complex qualification procedures. Some Labour organisers believe it could boost turnout by as much as 2% in some areas. Activists were told that if only one in six Labour voters in 1997 does not vote Labour this time, then 60 Labour seats will be lost and the party's majority cut by 120. Senior party figures have for months been expressing concern over cynicism among the general electorate and apathy among party activists. The postal polling drive follows a Home Office experiment during last spring's local elections, which showed that the most successful way to boost turnout was to ease all the restrictions on postal balloting. Until now, postal votes have only been available if the voter is certain to be abroad or is ill. An applicant has to apply to their local council or returning officer.

It was socialism by stealth and limited, for this was done by distribution of new wealth, never taxed directly away from the better off.</p> <p>Early on Tony Blair said he would fail if he did not leave a fairer society behind. The gap between rich and poor has not lessened - the distribution of wealth has probably got even more skewed - yet the lot of the poor has improved more sharply than at any time since the founding of the welfare state. A quarter of the 4m poor children have been lifted out of poverty. Weekly income for the poorest pensioners will have risen in April from \u00a368.80 in 1997 to \u00a392.15.</p> <p>The basic state pension will be up for rich and poor alike by \u00a35 plus the \u00a3200 fuel allowance. The working families' tax credit now helps 1m poor working families, none now living on less than \u00a3214 a week. Income support for children rose by 72% in real terms, child benefit for all by 25%. In April every household with children where earnings are under \u00a340,000 gets \u00a3520 a year instead of the old married couples' allowance of \u00a3285.</p> <p>Yet curiously none of this is the story Labour tells about itself. For this has also been a deeply conservative government, dogmatically attached to private finance and privatisation, for the tube and air traffic control. On the same side of the ledger Jack Straw pushed the population in prison up by 6,000 at a time crime has been falling and no more criminals were being caught. Asylum seekers were ritually abused (though few got sent back). There was pandering to Murdoch and the Mail, who still kicked them in the teeth.</p> <p>Labour, the neo-conservative party, promised no rise in income tax. It even cut the basic rate by 1%, perpetuating the Tory myth that voters can have low tax and good public services. Labour talked rights and responsibilities but no one breathed a word about the obligation on the rich or business to contribute more as wealth soared, while capital gains tax was cut and inheritance tax withered to virtually nil.</p> <p>How people rate the Blair government depends critically on their view of its first two years, when Labour accepted the Tories' punitive spending plans, lone parent cuts and all. This delayed the rolling out of Labour's best projects, action on the 2,000 worst housing estates, better treatment of young offenders, Sure Start for babies and a national programme for childcare. The spending pledge postponed improvements in health and education, which in turn led to public disappointment.</p> <p>But was that severe early restraint necessary? Even as the crowds were still celebrating on May 2 1997, inside No 10 the Blairites were reining in expectation, damping down excitement. They never quite believed in their victory, fearing the vanquished Tory foe would still rise from its grave. Full of folk memories of City panic on Harold Wilson's arrival in power, they feared a run on the pound, a flight of capital, spiralling inflation, all the Labour ghosts. Remember, too, that in spring 1997 the economy was predicted to turn down by October: the Bank of England pondered only whether it would be a hard or soft landing. In the event nothing happened. So with hindsight, it is easy now to see the first two years as a sorry waste. But who could have guessed then that the coffers would overflow?</p> <p>But now the money is in there can be no excuse for timidity in a second term. Labour's fearfulness postponed a decision on the euro that could have been taken at a gallop in the flush of their election victory. Yet Tony Blair was brave over Kosovo when he did the right thing for its own sake. On Labour's watch the world took a few stumbling steps towards greater mutual responsibility for human rights and human welfare: perhaps the very facility with which Labour resorted to the language of rights was itself progress. Labour led in cutting third world debt. Arms sales continued but at least more transparently than anywhere else, with details and destinations of shipments published for the first time.</p> <p>Constitutional reform brought representative government to the nations of the UK, the routing of old ermines from the Lords and a mayor and assembly for London. Devolution was badly done by a leader loath to let go, but done it was. Nothing much was done about the Commons. The promised strong draught of freedom of information was watered down as Labour ministers succumbed to a bad case of executive-mindedness. No coherent constitutional template was formed and critical questions of public sector morale and organisation dodged - which Labour will regret if it gets another term. Proportional representation for Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and European parliament elections sparked no enthusiasm for electoral reform at Westminster. The Blair vision of realigning the parties through PR, so making the 21st century safe for progressive government, got nowhere.</p> <p>So what is the final tally? If money in the pocket measures a government's success, the prosperous have prospered but so have the poor. If it is public confidence in the state and the services it supplies, then those two years of Tory spending were an error, which is being compounded by Labour's refusal to tax more. On present policies, there will never be enough to raise UK provision to European standards.</p> <p>As we trawled through departments examining what Labour did, we were puzzled by how a government famous for glossy annual reports and permanent spin had failed to communicate so much of what it was really up to. This has been a remarkably busy government. But unless a policy becomes a battle, a scandal or a joke it vanishes into the ether, virtually unreported. Our book ignores the Westminster soap opera in favour of hard evidence on change accomplished, outcomes measured. On that basis we have to conclude it has been a good government, blessed with fortunate circumstance. Had Labour been less afraid of its own shadow, less in thrall to a dead Thatcherite past, how much better it could have been - and might yet be.</p> <p>Extracted from Did Things Get Better? by Polly Toynbee and David Walker published by Penguin Books on 22 February at \u00a36.99.</p>",

Early on Tony Blair said he would fail if he did not leave a fairer society behind. The gap between rich and poor has not lessened - the distribution of wealth has probably got even more skewed - yet the lot of the poor has improved more sharply than at any time since the founding of the welfare state. A quarter of the 4m poor children have been lifted out of poverty. Weekly income for the poorest pensioners will have risen in April from \u00a368.80 in 1997 to \u00a392.15. The basic state pension will be up for rich and poor alike by \u00a35 plus the \u00a3200 fuel allowance. The working families' tax credit now helps 1m poor working families, none now living on less than \u00a3214 a week. Income support for children rose by 72% in real terms, child benefit for all by 25%. In April every household with children where earnings are under \u00a340,000 gets \u00a3520 a year instead of the old married couples' allowance of \u00a3285. Yet curiously none of this is the story Labour tells about itself. For this has also been a deeply conservative government, dogmatically attached to private finance and privatisation, for the tube and air traffic control. On the same side of the ledger Jack Straw pushed the population in prison up by 6,000 at a time crime has been falling and no more criminals were being caught. Asylum seekers were ritually abused (though few got sent back). There was pandering to Murdoch and the Mail, who still kicked them in the teeth. Labour, the neo-conservative party, promised no rise in income tax. It even cut the basic rate by 1%, perpetuating the Tory myth that voters can have low tax and good public services. Labour talked rights and responsibilities but no one breathed a word about the obligation on the rich or business to contribute more as wealth soared, while capital gains tax was cut and inheritance tax withered to virtually nil. How people rate the Blair government depends critically on their view of its first two years, when Labour accepted the Tories' punitive spending plans, lone parent cuts and all. This delayed the rolling out of Labour's best projects, action on the 2,000 worst housing estates, better treatment of young offenders, Sure Start for babies and a national programme for childcare. The spending pledge postponed improvements in health and education, which in turn led to public disappointment. But was that severe early restraint necessary? Even as the crowds were still celebrating on May 2 1997, inside No 10 the Blairites were reining in expectation, damping down excitement. They never quite believed in their victory, fearing the vanquished Tory foe would still rise from its grave. Full of folk memories of City panic on Harold Wilson's arrival in power, they feared a run on the pound, a flight of capital, spiralling inflation, all the Labour ghosts. Remember, too, that in spring 1997 the economy was predicted to turn down by October: the Bank of England pondered only whether it would be a hard or soft landing. In the event nothing happened. So with hindsight, it is easy now to see the first two years as a sorry waste. But who could have guessed then that the coffers would overflow? But now the money is in there can be no excuse for timidity in a second term. Labour's fearfulness postponed a decision on the euro that could have been taken at a gallop in the flush of their election victory. Yet Tony Blair was brave over Kosovo when he did the right thing for its own sake. On Labour's watch the world took a few stumbling steps towards greater mutual responsibility for human rights and human welfare: perhaps the very facility with which Labour resorted to the language of rights was itself progress. Labour led in cutting third world debt. Arms sales continued but at least more transparently than anywhere else, with details and destinations of shipments published for the first time. Constitutional reform brought representative government to the nations of the UK, the routing of old ermines from the Lords and a mayor and assembly for London. Devolution was badly done by a leader loath to let go, but done it was. Nothing much was done about the Commons. The promised strong draught of freedom of information was watered down as Labour ministers succumbed to a bad case of executive-mindedness. No coherent constitutional template was formed and critical questions of public sector morale and organisation dodged - which Labour will regret if it gets another term. Proportional representation for Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and European parliament elections sparked no enthusiasm for electoral reform at Westminster. The Blair vision of realigning the parties through PR, so making the 21st century safe for progressive government, got nowhere. So what is the final tally? If money in the pocket measures a government's success, the prosperous have prospered but so have the poor. If it is public confidence in the state and the services it supplies, then those two years of Tory spending were an error, which is being compounded by Labour's refusal to tax more. On present policies, there will never be enough to raise UK provision to European standards. As we trawled through departments examining what Labour did, we were puzzled by how a government famous for glossy annual reports and permanent spin had failed to communicate so much of what it was really up to. This has been a remarkably busy government. But unless a policy becomes a battle, a scandal or a joke it vanishes into the ether, virtually unreported. Our book ignores the Westminster soap opera in favour of hard evidence on change accomplished, outcomes measured. On that basis we have to conclude it has been a good government, blessed with fortunate circumstance. Had Labour been less afraid of its own shadow, less in thrall to a dead Thatcherite past, how much better it could have been - and might yet be.

Leeds is to offer a club-specific WAP mobile phone package through a deal with mobile phone operator BTCellnet and WAP software and service developer WAP Integrators. The move is likely to be replicated by other sports clubs. Leeds is offering its 1.7 million fans a free Siemens handset, free BTCellnet connection and one month's free line rental when they sign up for a 12-month contract. The cost of the monthly contract has not yet been decided. As well as betting and gaming via the handset, fans will be able to play football quizzes and lotteries and catch up on club and football news, including statistics and history. A \"push\" service, for fans who cannot watch a Leeds United game, will inform them on a real-time basis via SMS messaging when the team scores, wins a penalty or corner. The service will also offer email and online chat facilities, and exclusive purchasing opportunities via the phone for club tickets and merchandise. WAP Integrators believes the potential earnings from this type of deal are significant. In addition to the betting, revenues will accrue from SMS, location services, quizzes and lotteries. The club's directors believe there are 50,000 ardent fans who will be keen to have the service. It will be promoted through the club's official shop, mailings to the supporter database and in match programmes. The betting service will be trialled initially with approximately 100 Leeds United supporters before going out to a wider audience. The concept is highly applicable to other sporting and leisure communities. WAP Integrators will target football clubs in the Premier and Nationwide leagues once the concept has been tested with Leeds United. The company will also be targeting European and Latin American clubs as well as other mainstream sports, such as rugby union and Superleague clubs.",

      "body": "<b>Why do we need new anti-terror laws?</b> <br> The government believes that Britain is being used as a haven by groups intent on subverting the international order by violence. Among them are radical Islamist organisations, shadowy European revolutionary cells, and an assortment of liberation armies from the developing world. The old Prevention of Terrorism Act specifically targeted Irish militant groups. <p><b>What new powers will the government have?</b><br> The Home Secretary will be able to proscribe organisations, making membership or support of them illegal. The list starts with 14 groups, all Irish. It is likely to expand rapidly, though the Home Office says that ministers have yet to decide which groups will be added. </p> <p><b>They must have some idea?</b><br> The organisations most mentioned are mostly Islamist ones. They include the al-Qaida movement headed by Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, which is dedicated to the establishment of strict Islamist states around the world. Then there is Hizbollah in Lebanon, the Armed Islamic Group in Algeria, Al-Gama'at al-Islamiyya in Egypt, and a clutch of Palestinian armed groups, some Islamist and some secular. </p> <p><b>Is it an anti-Arab thing?</b><br> The militant groups say it is, and have issued bellicose warnings that the legislation could make Britain a target. In fact, the net is likely to spread far beyond the Arab and Islamic world.

Once an organisation is proscribed, it will be illegal to belong to it, support it financially, or even to be present at a meeting of three people or more if one of those people is a member. </p> <p><b>Is the Act restricted to those groups which commit crimes here?</b><br> No. It will be an offence to incite, or call for, militant acts abroad. Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, says the government is determined that the UK will not be used as a base \"for the planning and preparation of terrorism here or abroad\". </p> <p><b>How is terrorism defined?</b><br> It used to be, roughly speaking, violence with political motivation. From now on the definition will include anyone serving a \"political, religious or ideological\" cause, who uses violence or the threat of violence against people or property. </p> <p><b>But terrorism still has to involve violence?</b><br> The new Act has an interesting new IT-age dimension. It targets so-called cyber-terrorists who hack into computer networks to undermine governments or threaten lives. </p> <p><b>Who is in favour of the Act?</b><br> Our government and governments everywhere, both repressive and otherwise. Egypt, under threat from the Muslim Brotherhood, is very keen for Britain to clamp down on alleged conspirators here. Sri Lanka takes a similar view. The USA also appproves - the State Department maintains a list of nearly 40 organisations it deems to be subversive. </p> <p><b>And who is against?</b><br> Militant groups, of course, hate it. So do civil libertarians, who are aghast at the sweeping powers given to ministers and officials.

The figure, higher than for the whole of the year 2000, reflected a broader intensification of Iraqi offensive activity since the New Year, a spokesman said. It is believed to be linked to Baghdad's acquisition of a new fibre optic aircraft detection system, which was targeted in Friday's air strikes. The strikes have led to a torrent of international condemnation, headed by the Arab League, Russia, China and France. Baghdad said two civilians died in the raids which, said Britain and the US, were necessary to defend the safety of Allied air crew patrolling no-fly zones in the north and south of the country. Last year, Allied planes took action on 34 occasions in the northern no-fly zone and 44 in the south.

      "body": "<p>February in Hollywood is the annual equivalent of bin-night, when the studios throw out the trash they think nobody with a brain is ever likely to want. And it has certainly been a dumpster of a month so far. First there was Valentine, which cried out for a stake through its heart, then Hannibal and Saving Silverman, both of which were better left for dead. Instead they were smeared across 3,000 screens nationwide. </p> <p>This weekend, in the place of trash, we got Hollywood's version of recycling. I always understood this was a process whereby rubbish was reconfigured into something usable, but movie-makers seem to think it's a reverse-alchemical process for turning gold into base metal. There were two new releases - Down to Earth and Sweet November - and both were dime-store remakes of only marginally better movies. </p> <p>There were high hopes for Down to Earth, the debut star vehicle for comedian Chris Rock. Rock joined the cast of Saturday Night Live the same season as Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, Rob Schneider and David Spade, with whom he shared a cramped office. All of them put Rock in their own SNL spinoff movies but it has taken him nearly seven years to get his own name above the title. Meanwhile, he has increased his reputation with The Chris Rock Show on HBO and two blistering stand-up specials. The first of them, Bring the Pain, marked the first time a young, hip, black American male had expressed his detailed contempt for some of the idiocies of gangsta-rap culture.</p> <p>Down to Earth was nothing like as funny or harsh as Bring the Pain, and it is hard to imagine what Rock saw in this project about a black comedian who is called to heaven 44 years too early, then returns to earth in the body of a 55-year-old white capitalist pig. Which brings us back to recycling. Down to Earth is the umpteenth remake of the 1941 comedy Here Comes Mr Jordan, and this version comes courtesy of the people who gave us American Pie. Most assume that it is just a remake of 1978's Heaven Can Wait - whose writers, Warren Beatty and Elaine May, are credited as source material. Here Comes Mr Jordan was based on a play by Harry Segall called Halfway to Heaven, and was so popular that it spawned a rash of wartime imitators. There was A Guy Named Joe (boringly remade by Spielberg as Always), The Horn Blows at Midnight, and Jordan's own musical semi-sequel, called - well, fancy that - Down to Earth. Add Powell and Pressburger's superficially similar A Matter of Life and Death and you've got one well-trodden stairway to heaven. </p> <p>Is the bumbling, shapeless Heaven Can Wait worth remaking? If I want Warren in his Julie Christie period and Julie in her perm period I'll take the mighty mighty McCabe and Mrs Miller any day. Down to Earth certainly does nothing to invigorate the material, which originally flourished in the more god-fearing world war two era when heaven was on a lot more people's minds than it is now. </p> <p>Sweet November, on the other hand, brought hell right to the front of my mind. It is a remake of a 1968 weepie of the same title with the unlikely starring duo of Sandy Dennis (a byword for irritatingly \"kooky\") and Anthony Newley. This time the roles are taken by Charlize Theron and Keanu Reeves. She's a free spirit (you can tell by all the cartwheels she does) who lives with a different man for successive 30-day periods, then sets them free after showing them how great life really is. Of course Keanu's businessman falls for her, but then she catches one of those photogenic terminal diseases that wastes free spirits away but leaves no outward trace. Theron goes through the cutesy motions with some efficiency, but Keanu is all adrift. He can do clear and simple - as in Point Break and The Matrix - but deep and complex defeat him. In Sweet November he looks quite lost playing the yuppie who regains his soul but loses the love of his life. In the auditorium, meanwhile, the audience is losing its collective lunch, as it prays for an end to Hollywood recycling - or regurgitation - and inwardly howls, \"Roll on, March!\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "February in Hollywood is the annual equivalent of bin-night, when the studios throw out the trash they think nobody with a brain is ever likely to want. And it has certainly been a dumpster of a month so far. First there was Valentine, which cried out for a stake through its heart, then Hannibal and Saving Silverman, both of which were better left for dead. Instead they were smeared across 3,000 screens nationwide. This weekend, in the place of trash, we got Hollywood's version of recycling. I always understood this was a process whereby rubbish was reconfigured into something usable, but movie-makers seem to think it's a reverse-alchemical process for turning gold into base metal. There were two new releases - Down to Earth and Sweet November - and both were dime-store remakes of only marginally better movies. There were high hopes for Down to Earth, the debut star vehicle for comedian Chris Rock. Rock joined the cast of Saturday Night Live the same season as Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, Rob Schneider and David Spade, with whom he shared a cramped office. All of them put Rock in their own SNL spinoff movies but it has taken him nearly seven years to get his own name above the title. Meanwhile, he has increased his reputation with The Chris Rock Show on HBO and two blistering stand-up specials. The first of them, Bring the Pain, marked the first time a young, hip, black American male had expressed his detailed contempt for some of the idiocies of gangsta-rap culture. Down to Earth was nothing like as funny or harsh as Bring the Pain, and it is hard to imagine what Rock saw in this project about a black comedian who is called to heaven 44 years too early, then returns to earth in the body of a 55-year-old white capitalist pig. Which brings us back to recycling. Down to Earth is the umpteenth remake of the 1941 comedy Here Comes Mr Jordan, and this version comes courtesy of the people who gave us American Pie. Most assume that it is just a remake of 1978's Heaven Can Wait - whose writers, Warren Beatty and Elaine May, are credited as source material. Here Comes Mr Jordan was based on a play by Harry Segall called Halfway to Heaven, and was so popular that it spawned a rash of wartime imitators. There was A Guy Named Joe (boringly remade by Spielberg as Always), The Horn Blows at Midnight, and Jordan's own musical semi-sequel, called - well, fancy that - Down to Earth. Add Powell and Pressburger's superficially similar A Matter of Life and Death and you've got one well-trodden stairway to heaven. Is the bumbling, shapeless Heaven Can Wait worth remaking? If I want Warren in his Julie Christie period and Julie in her perm period I'll take the mighty mighty McCabe and Mrs Miller any day. Down to Earth certainly does nothing to invigorate the material, which originally flourished in the more god-fearing world war two era when heaven was on a lot more people's minds than it is now. Sweet November, on the other hand, brought hell right to the front of my mind. It is a remake of a 1968 weepie of the same title with the unlikely starring duo of Sandy Dennis (a byword for irritatingly \"kooky\") and Anthony Newley. This time the roles are taken by Charlize Theron and Keanu Reeves. She's a free spirit (you can tell by all the cartwheels she does) who lives with a different man for successive 30-day periods, then sets them free after showing them how great life really is. Of course Keanu's businessman falls for her, but then she catches one of those photogenic terminal diseases that wastes free spirits away but leaves no outward trace. Theron goes through the cutesy motions with some efficiency, but Keanu is all adrift. He can do clear and simple - as in Point Break and The Matrix - but deep and complex defeat him. In Sweet November he looks quite lost playing the yuppie who regains his soul but loses the love of his life. In the auditorium, meanwhile, the audience is losing its collective lunch, as it prays for an end to Hollywood recycling - or regurgitation - and inwardly howls, \"Roll on, March!\"",

      "bodyText": "One of Lord Birt's closest allies, Margaret Salmon, is leaving the BBC where she held a \u00a3230,000-a-year job. Ms Salmon, 53, was head of BBC resources the unit responsible for studio hire and outside broadcasts. A spokesman said she had decided to take \"early retirement\". Ms Salmon was a close colleague of Lord Birt during his years as director-general of the BBC. She was responsible for implementing some of his most unpopular policies. \"She had a difficult time with staff, axing thousands of jobs and introducing the reviled producer choice for Birt,\" said one colleague. Ms Salmon's departure follows the exit of two other senior executives who were close to Lord Birt - head of policy Patricia Hodgson and news chief Tony Hall. Today, Lord Birt's successor Greg Dyke said Ms Salmon had planned to retire in 1999 but had been persuaded to stay for another two years. \"I've enjoyed working with Margaret for the past year,\" said Mr Dyke. \"She has done a great job in getting the business into a position where we expect it will make its first profits next year,\" he added. She said: \"Working for the BBC for 10 years as director of personnel and chief executive of resources has been a tremenduous privilege. \"My personnel years involved supporting colleagues through some ecxciting times and I am pleased as I leave resources the business in such good shape to support the BBC in future.\" Ms Salmon's appointment as head of resources was greeted with surprise two years ago. Many believed she was being promoted as a reward for her loyalty to the BBC chief. However, she won the support of staff unions, who had clashed heavily with her predecessor Rod Lynch over his suspected privatisation ambitions. Under his stewardship, the main BBC TV studios were available to all comers. These included businesses who wanted to entertain corporate clients on sets such as that for Noel Edmonds' House Party. In a reverse of Mr Lynch's policy, Ms Salmon reintegrated resources into the BBC and, in the process, reduced the number of staff working under her from 6,000 to 2,000.",

We are delighted with the alliance because it introduces even more e-commerce professionals to the IDM,\" said IDM managing director Professor Derek Holder. E-command.co.uk co-founder Sharon Smith added: \"This partnership means we can ensure our members receive the best possible direct and interactive marketing training to build on the knowledge base they acquire at our evening seminars.\" Last month IDM announced a similar strategic relationship with Phoenix Network, formerly known as e-women, an organisation for women in e-commerce, which also forms a council of the Direct Marketing Association. Both agreements mean preferential rates and treatment for each organisation's members when making use of the other's events.",

Now and then its presence is felt - when an architect adds a sudden burst of warm colour to brighten up the otherwise essentially cool, neutral aesthetic of much of today's European design. </p> <p>Among buildings designed over the past decade alone, the delightful houses that John Pawson and Claudio Silvestrin built for a German art dealer in Majorca and Seth Stein for himself in Knightsbridge owe more than a little to Barragan. So, too, does some of the work of the inspired Japanese architect Tadao Ando. Barragan's name is hallowed - and deservedly so. His work, celebrated in a new exhibition at London's Design Museum, reminds architects worldwide that the best architecture has spirit and soul. </p> <p>That soul is present in every post-1945 Barragan project: his own house and studio (Tacubaya, 1947), the San Cristobal stud farm (Los Clubes, 1968), the chapel of the Capuchinas Sacramentarias del Purismo Corazon de Maria (1955), all in and around Mexico City. It is even present in the astonishing abstract eruption of the Satellite City tower (1957), a public artwork on a scintillating scale alongside the Queretaro highway. </p> <p>Each building, garden or artwork lifts the spirit. The life-enhancing chapel is achingly beautiful inside. Yet, like so many Barragan buildings, it is ultra-modern, while realised in the simplest materials - in this case adobe, timber and limewash. When Barragan uses the strictest rules of geometry, it feels as if Mies van der Rohe has come out on holiday to Mexico, knocked back a few tequilas, relaxed, coated his steel-framed buildings in thick mud walls and then painted them pink. </p> <p>These two names are not linked by chance. Barragan, raised on a ranch near Mazamitra, Guadalajara, was educated by Marists and Jesuits before training as an engineer. After graduating in 1924, he decided to become an architect. He taught himself partly by setting off on a highly personalised grand tour of Europe and north Africa. Although profoundly moved by the Moorish Alhambra in Granada, Spain, and the mud architecture of north Africa, he was equally impressed by lectures he attended in Paris given by Le Corbusier and by some of the best early Modern movement architecture. </p> <p>I'm not sure if he ever saw it in the flesh, so to speak, but Mies van der Rohe's German pavilion, built for the 1929 Barcelona World Fair, must have been a significant influence. When, as at the breathtaking San Cristobal stud farm where he kept his own horses, Barragan plays with elemental geometric forms he seems to be arriving at the same point as Mies did at Barcelona, but under an even harder sun. </p> <p>Both architects, Prussian and Mexican, understood the mollifying play of water when set closely against the clean lines of modern buildings. Both, whatever Mies might have said in public, remained Catholics. Both proved that spirituality and modern architecture could inhabit the same abstract realm. </p> <p>Where they differed was in the plans of their buildings: where Mies became the champion of the open-plan, of indeterminate space, Barragan's houses, especially those he built in his property-developing days in the 1930s and 1940s, were based around individual rooms. Tradition tugged at Barragan's sensibilities all his life: he was, at heart, a horseman, a gentleman rancher. He was never a Modern iconoclast or utopian dreamer as were so many of his European contemporaries. </p> <p>Barragan was normally a generous man. When he was asked to rebuild and extend a convent in Tlalplan not far from his own home, he paid for the extra work needed to give the resident nuns a special design far and above what they had expected. The result was a sensual, spiritual place influenced by the Court of the Myrtles at the Alhambra. </p> <p>Just as the Moors sought to create oases mediated by rich and subtle architecture in north Africa and southern Spain, so Barragan aimed to re-create echoes of the Garden of Eden in many of his projects. Aside from the Alhambra, he was much taken by the French gardens of artist Ferdinand Bac in Provence, and particularly by the Les Columbiers near Menton. </p> <p>The essential architecture of Barragan, in its mature post-1945 phase, is a very particular brand of Mies and Le Corbusier-influenced European modernism, with a touch of north Africa, the Alhambra and the sunny gardens of Ferdinand Bac. The use of gloriously touchy-feely local materials, plus a generous use of water (\"In fountains,\" he liked to say, \"silence sings\") and colour, completes the picture. </p> <p>\"Any work of architecture that does not express serenity is a mistake,\" said Barragan, when accepting the Pritzker prize for architecture in 1980. He went on to remind his audience of the other words that ought to matter. These were not \"orthogonal\", \"postmodern\", \"net-to-gross\" or \"neoprene\", but \"spellbound\", \"magic\", \"enchantment\", \"intimacy\" and \"amazement\". It is essential, he said, for architects to \"see in such a way that [their] vision is not overpowered by rational analysis\". </p> <p>Barragan's are buildings that don't disappoint. But don't, having seen the Design Museum show, imagine that a charter flight to Mexico will find you in a world designed according to Barragan. If not exactly a prophet without honour in his own country, Barragan still cuts a lone figure in Mexico as elsewhere: so many architects and clients must want to overcome \"rational analysis\", but the danger of going the way of colourful kitsch and over-sentimentality is always there. Invoking the spirit of Luis Barragan is much harder than it looks. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Luis Barragan: the Quiet Revolution is at the Design Museum, London SE1 (020-7940 8790), from March 9 to July 8.</p>",

But lawyers across the political spectrum drew back from endorsing the demand made by Michael Howard QC, the former Tory home secretary, that Lord Irvine's act of \"fundamental corruption\" required his instant resignation from Tony Blair's cabinet. \"Not the way to behave, but not a resignation matter,\" said one former Conservative government law officer. He reflected widespread dismay that a man in Lord Irvine's position should lay himself open to complaints that he has abused his \"heavy powers of patronage\" over the appointment of judges and QCs. Another prominent QC, Anthony Scrivener, who gave Labour \u00a36,000 in the past - and was tipped as a potential lord chancellor - but is now disillusioned by its policies, accused Lord Irvine of throwing away the centuries-old impartiality of his office. Mr Scrivener said: \"I cannot think how anyone in their right mind could have thought it right. He has thrown away the impartiality of the lord chancellor, which everybody has been able to maintain for hundreds of years.\" But other lawyers said many recipients of Lord Irvine's invitation to a West End dinner did not stand to suffer or benefit in any way from his attitude. The offending letter, on Labour party (not Whitehall) notepaper, was sent to senior barristers whom the lord chancellor is empowered to make QCs or judges, as well to leading solicitors, whose body the Law Society is in conflict with him over legal aid reforms. The letter was an invitation to a fund-raising dinner on February 7 hosted by Lord Irvine at the Atlantic Bar and Grill in central London. The guest of honour was the prime minister's wife, Cherie Booth QC, and the attorney general, Lord Williams of Mostyn, was the guest speaker. The event has been held annually for the past three years, Lord Irvine's letter said. \"There is no ticket price this year.

Opponents in the Tory party have accused Lord Irvine, who is a close friend of the prime minister, Tony Blair, of abusing a traditionally neutral office for party political gain. Others have called for his office to be reformed to prevent such conflicts of interest. The lord chancellor is the head of the judiciary, Britain's most senior judge and responsible for appointing new judges from the lawyers' ranks. Many of those he lobbied could be potential candidates. Michael Howard, the former home secretary, said Lord Irvine's fund-raising activities were \"a fundamental corruption\" of the office of lord chancellor and demanded his resignation. \"This is the man who appoints QCs, who appoints judges, and he writes a letter to the very people who are candidates for those positions saying: 'Come to this dinner, you don't need to pay anything but you are expected to contribute at least \u00a3200 to the Labour Party',\" he said. Tory MP Michael Fabricant, a member of the Commons home affairs select committee, said he would urge the committee to hold an inquiry into the matter. \"The idea that someone who appoints judges ... should now be trawling for party funds is reminiscent of the worst days of the Clinton White House,\" he said. Downing Street said Lord Irving had done nothing wrong and maintained that the row was contrived. The prime minister's official spokesman said it was no secret that Irvine was a Labour supporter, \"therefore hosting a fundraising dinner for the Labour party is not terribly newsworthy\". Liberal Democrat peer Lord Lester said the lord chancellor's role should be reformed, something he claimed Lord Irvine supported before taking office. \"When he was in Opposition he was in favour of changing the system but while in office he has held on to his empire. \"It says in the Bible that no man should serve two masters.

He said Israel would keep a close watch on developments in the Gulf and would remain in contact with the United States for updates.\" Email dbrown445@aol.com Related articles 19.2.2001: Doubts over Iraq air strikes 19.2.2001: Raid shows Bush-Blair bond on Iraw 19.2.2001: No contest in the battle for Arab hearts and minds 19.2.2001: US sights turn to Iraqi oil lifeline 19.2.2001, leader: This man is dangerous Useful links The Children of Iraq International Action Centre Campaign Against Sanctions Iraq and the sanctions",

Radi Antic axed his latest signing from the squad that travelled to Zaragoza on Sunday, accusing him of lacking fitness. </p> <p>\"Stan's been left out of the squad because he's a long way from the fitness level he should be at,\" Antic explained, apparently unaware whose job it is to organise training. \"I haven't been happy with his performances so far, and he needs to prove he's better than that\". But just as the hacks were gleefully penning yet another football obituary for the Brummie bad boy, Antic insisted that Stan still has a future at the club, claiming: \"He's a great asset for us\".</p> <p>Despite Collymore's absence, something truly amazing happened on Sunday - Oviedo scored. It was the 33rd minute when the ball fell to French centre back Federic Danjou, who emphatically smashed home the glory goal (OK, OK, he kneed it over the line from a few yards) - Oviedo's first away all season.</p> <p>Typical: like the L2 that runs from calle Ur\u00eda to the home of Gris\u00fa C.F. in Cerde\u00f1o, oventenses wait months for one and two turn up at the same time - Jamie Fern\u00e1ndez got another twenty minutes from full time</p> <p>Not that it made any difference - Radi Antic's side might have scored two, but they conceded five.

Perhaps not - la Real had more than a little help from an Espanyol side apparently desperate to gift them the points, and referee Bueno Grimal also seemed to be in on the conspiracy. An own goal from Sergio Gonz\u00e1lez set John Benjamin's boys on their way, and Oscar de Paula scored the winner from the spot after a shocking dive from Aitor Rekarte - which was outside the box anyway - somehow impressed the ref. </p> <p>Numancia weren't much better in beating Malaga 3-2, their winner coming from a Ruben Navarro penalty in the dying moments.</p> <p><strong>Real roll on</strong></p> <p>There are those people - cynics and liars, the lot of them - who think that I've been sabotaging the Marca website. Last week, Steve McManaman found his way onto the site's Quinta del Buitre/Ra\u00fal Madrid \"dream team\". And this week, following Madrid's superb 3-2 win against Lazio in the Champions League, Madrid fans voted Macca their side's most on-form player, ahead of Ivan Helguera, Luis Figo and Roberto Carlos. </p> <p>At the bottom of the list was Iker Casillas, whose shocking blunder against Lazio was his third balls-up in consecutive games. And poor Iker felt it, too. Tears running down his cheeks, he was inconsolable after the Lazio match, despite the best efforts of Aitor Karanka, Fernando Hierro and, oddly enough, the press - who rather than give the teenage keeper a justified slating, reminded him that he is in good company, including Zubizarreta, Busquets and David \"Sheaman\".</p> <p>So Casillas must have felt at least a twinge of sympathy this weekend as he watched Racing Santander keeper Jos\u00e9 Ceballos's outrageous howler hand an uninspiring (and Macca-less) Real Madrid all three points at the Bernab\u00e9u. </p> <p>With the three points in the bag (just), Real's players trotted off happily enough. And they left the Bernab\u00e9u happier yet, having seen Barcelona fall eleven points behind with a 3-2 defeat at the hands of Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a in the Nou Camp. A bit short-sighted perhaps, with Depor just four points behind and Real Madrid travelling to the Riazor next weekend. </p> <p>Only the Man in the Moustache seemed to realise as much. He admitted before the weekend's games that he'd have rather see Bar\u00e7a win than Depor, and he's since said he'd sooner beat Javier Irureta's side this weekend than Serra Ferrer's the following week. </p> <p><strong>Deportivo break Nou Camp duck</strong></p> <p>Depor went 1-0 up in the sixth minute through Djalminha, but Bar\u00e7a were certainly the better side in the first half, with Luis Enrique flying on the right side of midfield. And they soon got their reward with Rivaldo scoring a penalty and Luis Enrique adding a second with a fine header.</p> <p>It was all to no avail, though. V\u00edctor scored two superb second-half goals for Depor to clinch their first ever win at the Nou Camp. His dramatic injury-time winner proved once again that Javier Irureta is the king of cunning free-kicks - a short ball fooled the Bar\u00e7a wall, which comically tried to shuffle sideways like a bunch of red-necked yokels at a line-dancing competition, and V\u00edctor smashed in an unstoppable shot. </p> <p>V\u00edctor then dropped to his knees and prayed. Afterwards he revealed that he had been \"deeply affected\" by news of an accident on Friday which had killed Spanish cyclist Ricardo Otxoa and left his brother Javier in a coma. V\u00edctor, who admitted to having barely slept, dedicated his goals to the brothers who ride for Kelme. \"It was very emotional,\" said V\u00edctor, \"I had loads of things swimming round in my mind and had spoken to lots of friends during the week\". \"One even told me I was going to score the winner.\" he revealed. \"I'm going to ask him for his lottery numbers this week\".</p> <p>There were emotions of a different kind in the Bar\u00e7a dressing room. Manu Petit didn't appreciate being asked to warm up only to watch Gerard and Dani get sent on instead. Throwing his boots down, Petit - who still hasn't fulfilled his promise to shoot comedy keeper Richard Dutruel - tried to storm off but was persuaded (not for the first time this season) to stay on the bench and fester instead. </p> <p>Petit's not alone, either. The Dutch old guard have lost the privileged position they held under Van Gaal and rumours abound of clashes between \"General\u00edsimo\" Lorenzo Serra Ferrer (a ridiculously harsh title given its connotations in Spain) and de Boer, Zenden and Patrick Kluivert. </p> <p>Serra Ferrer, whose only successful signing has been Marc Overmars, is becoming ever more unpopular and looks unlikely to be in the hotseat next season. As if to emphasise the point, Bar\u00e7a director \u00c1ngel Fern\u00e1ndez offered that old favourite - the insincere vote of confidence: \"We still have confidence in Serra Ferrer, but results dictate things\". </p> <p>With Fabio Capello already turning the job down (apparently he'd rather lose against Liverpool) and the rumours surrounding H\u00e9ctor C\u00faper subsiding, one name looms large. Even larger - if that's possible - than it has done for the last five years. Yep, Johan Cruyff could be back - if, that is, he can bury his differences (which include legal action) with the club and its president, Joan Gaspart.</p> <p><strong>Aimar impresses again</strong></p> <p>Barcelona might look for a new boss even sooner if they slip out of the Champions League positions, and that's certainly a possibility now. Pablo Aimar impressed again (and scored) as Valencia beat Las Palmas 2-0 to go above Bar\u00e7a into third. And Villarreal and Mallorca are also closing in (both are two points behind) after wins against Valladolid (2-1) and Athletic Bilbao (1-0) respectively. </p> <p>Below them lie Rayo Vallecano and Alav\u00e9s, whose midweek Uefa Cup excitements were quickly forgotten in dull encounters - Alav\u00e9s beat Osasuna 1-0, while Rayo drew 1-1 against Celta in Vigo.</p> <p>But while Lorenzo Serra Ferrer might not have the top job pretty soon, another opening is on the cards - the Catalan giants have just opened the first of thirty FC Barcelona petrol stations at L'Estartit in Gerona. \"Pump 4?

      "bodyText": "The local government and regions minister, Hilary Armstrong, is being asked to brighten up the beacon council scheme by offering greater financial freedoms to make it more attractive to local authorities. The influential beacon council advisory panel, which is made up of leading local government, trade union and business leaders, has called for the introduction of new \"whole-council beacons\" and says local authorities should be offered more freedom from government control. There is real concern that the beacon council scheme - which is designed to celebrate excellence in local service delivery - attracted only 179 applications from 123 local authorities this year compared with a total of 269 applications from 211 councils in its first year of operation. Ministers and the advisory panel had hoped that they could attract more entries by increasing the number of service areas covered by the beacon awards from seven to 11 but the result has been doubly disappointing with a sharp fall in entries in just the second year of the scheme. Both the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the Improvement and Development Agency have launched an evaluation of the effectiveness of the beacon awards, which was originally seen as one way of allowing councils greater financial autonomy in setting business rates and council tax levels. So far beacons have only proved popular among county councils with 76% applying for awards this year, but the advisory panel says local government would welcome a clear statement on the future of the scheme \"including the introduction of whole-council beacons and the availability of additional freedoms and flexibilities\". Many local government leaders believe that the beacon scheme has been bypassed by the development of new-style local public service agreements. They also point out that councils are already subject to several inspection regimes and able to highlight service improvements through a range of schemes that includes charter marks and other awards. The advisory panel, which is chaired by Lord Filkin, has close links with the best value inspectorate forum. It has stressed the value of the beacon scheme \"as a tool for service improvement under best value\" and is urging councils to take part in the nationwide programme of workshops and open days to promote best practice. It suggest that ministers should do more to meet the costs of bidding for beacon status which could be \u00a380,000 or more for some authorities, and it argues that this may help attract more applications, especially from many of the smaller district councils. In its report on the second year of the scheme it also acknowledged that there are limits to the value of beacon status and says: \"Quite clearly excellence in local government is not restricted to those councils we are recommending for beacon status.

The Golden Bear went to Patrice Chereau's Intimacy, a Franco-Italian co-production made in London and culled from Hanif Kureishi's autobiographical novel of the same name. Not only that, but the Best Actress award went to the Australian actress Kerry Fox, the lead with Mark Rylance in the film.</p> <p>This was a considerable shock since it was generally thought that Steven Soderbergh's Oscar-nominated Traffic would win the main award as the best of the big American movies on view, and that British actress Emma Thompson deserved the Best Actress award for a magnificent performance in Mike Nichols' Wit, an adaptation of an American play in which she plays a successful academic taken to hospital with terminal ovarian cancer.</p> <p>Intimacy split its audiences, if not the jury, into two parts - the larger of which thought this tale of sexual obsession was both portentous and unsatisfactory. It's the story of two married people who meet each Wednesday for sex, scarcely speaking to each other and forming no kind of relationship other than in bed. One of them (Rylance) has left his wife and children and the other (Fox) is an actress with a loquacious taxi-driver husband (Timothy Spall).</p> <p>Gradually, however, the man gets intrigued by his sexual partner and decides to attempt to discover something about her. Then the fun begins, since the taxi driver is not best pleased by what he finds out and the woman herself wants to give up the relationship. The moral of the film clearly is that sex alone is not enough - fairly obvious, in fact. But done with this intensity it's at least capable of forging a tale of amour fou to be remembered.</p> <p>Unfortunately, this is a French director's film which means that the screenplay, written by Chereau himself with an accomplice and not by Kureishi, sits oddly on its English setting. Added to that, the sex, which includes an unsimulated fellatio sequence for the first time in an openly commercial film, gets boringly repetitive. You can't have much sympathy for anyone in the picture except perhaps the taxi driver whom Spall paints with all his familiar near-to-caricature skill.</p> <p>Traffic, however, was not totally ignored. Benicio Del Toro rightly won the Best Actor award for his performance in a film that at least proves that Hollywood isn't totally bereft of anything but obvious talent these days. Wit, however, was, and most people couldn't understand why.</p> <p>This clever and moving adaptation of Margaret Edson's prize-winning play gave Thompson the chance, in her first film part for three years, to give a stunning performance as a woman whose whole life has been a success until she is forced to confront failure for the first time. Told by her doctors that the only hope is the heaviest dose of chemotherapy, she decides to take the chance and suffers accordingly.</p> <p>Added to that, she also faces the members of an American medical establishment who, in order not to involve themselves emotionally, deliberately distance themselves from their patients, and it is left to the black nurse (Audra MacDonald, also very good) and her old tutor (Eileen Atkins) to help her through the final stages.</p> <p>Such a film, made for Home Box Office, the American television channel, is not an easy one to look at since it makes very few of the usual compromises and refuses a feelgood ending. But Thompson's often humorous performance - she helped to write the screenplay with Nichols - leavens it a little. And anyway such acting, put completely to the service of the material and in no sense a star turn, is very rare indeed.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the festival, which finally said farewell to Moritz de Hadeln, its director for some 20 years, and a controversial figure since he is half Swiss and half English, unleashed upon us so many films in each of its three sections that it proved impossible to see more than a tenth of them.</p> <p>One of the most popular films in the competition was Italian for Beginners, the first Danish Dogma film to be directed by a woman. Lone Sherfig's film adheres to most of the Dogma rules, such as no artifical light, hand-held cameras (and no sex during the shooting), but does so with enough skill to make its watchers scarcely notice the difference between this and an ordinary production.</p> <p>It's a light-hearted piece about a group of Danes from a dreary Copenhagen suburb who go to Italian classes and get romantically mixed up with each other. But its skill lies not in its effervescence but in the natural characterisation and unaffected acting. The film received a rousing reception from both the critical audience and the general public. The International Critics Jury gave the film its prize for the competition and even the main jury admitted its charm by according Italian for Beginners its minor Jury Prize.</p> <p>As usual, the East, always given a good showing in Berlin, also came into the reckoning. Wang Xiaoshuai's Beijing Bicycle, a sympathetic and skilful Chinese film about the travails of a courier from the countryside in the big city, won the Grand Jury Prize, virtually the second best award in the festival, and, more surprisingly, the Best Director prize went to Lin Cheng-sheng for his work on Betelnut Beauty, a rather meandering Taiwanese film about young people growing up in Taipeh.</p> <p>Some of the best films were shown in the Forum and Panorama sections. The Forum, also under new management next year since Ulrich and Erika Grigor, who built this radical section up from nothing, are also retiring, produced several outstanding documentaries and bravely included 10 features from Vietnam which had never been seen in Europe before. Most of them were not exactly masterpieces. But one, The Scent of Guavas, certainly deserved the considerable praise it gathered.</p> <p>In all, the Berlin programme, now housed in the most modern and luxurious cinemas on the festival circuit, and blessed with enough money to expand even further, could be called a qualified success this year. There were just enough good movies to suggest that world cinema isn't yet totally defeated by the money and star-power of Hollywood, if not quite enough to give that much hope that America will cease to be the be-all and end-all of commercial film-making.

The definition of terrorism in the bill includes \"the use or threat, for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, or ideological cause, of action which involves serious violence against any person or property\". This could embrace not only armed extremists but also environmental activists attacking GM crops.</p> <p>For the first time, the term \"terrorism\" will apply to domestic groups which can be proscribed by the home secretary. It will be an offence to \"provide money or other property\" which may be used \"for the purposes of terrorism\" and not tell the police when you suspect others of doing so.</p> <p>It will be a criminal offence to speak at the same meeting as someone from a proscribed organisation.</p> <p>This will have the peculiar result of making it a criminal offence to oppose such an organisation. The meeting could be of no more than three people, private or public. It could be an informal gathering or a discussion in a pub.</p> <p>The Act also introduces a criminal offence of \"incitement\" - an offence which could catch, for example, anyone calling for the overthrow of undemocratic regimes abroad. It would have caught Nelson Mandela and other ANC leaders who supported armed struggle against the apartheid regime in South Africa.</p> <p>The Act gives the police an array of sweeping new powers and in effect sets up a parallel criminal justice system wide open to abuse and far beyond the provisions of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. It gives them stop and search powers on the basis of \"expediency\" and of \"suspicion\", not of committing any offence, but of being connected, or potentially connected, to the bill's vague description of \"terrorism\".</p> <p>The Act, says Wadham, \"creates a two-tier system - in which people suspected of a criminal act for moral or political reasons will have less rights than someone who commits a similar crime for reasons of lust, greed or viciousness\".</p> <p>By concentrating on motivation, it includes activity which the vast majority of the public would not regard as terrorism, while excluding gangs of racketeers or drug-runners, for example, engaged in serious criminal activities.</p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/crime/0,2759,339240,00.html\">Policing crime</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/humanrights/0,7368,367207,00.html\">Human rights in the UK</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4137654,00.html\">17.2.2001: Defector lifts lid on the business of terror</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4135880,00.html\">14.2.2001: Suspected Islamic terrorists arrested</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/\">Home Office</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/20000011.htm\">Terrorism Act 2000</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "From today there will be hundreds, perhaps even thousands more \"terrorist suspects\" in Britain. As John Wadham, director of Liberty, the civil rights group, has pointed out, under the new Terrorism Act, protesters and activists, with no interest in overthrowing the state or harming the general public, could find themselves falling under the Act's expanded definition of terrorism. Under the Act it is a criminal offence to possess any \"article\" or \"information\", including photographs, in circumstances which give rise to a \"reasonable suspicion\" they would be used for \"terrorist\" purposes - a clause which has serious implications, not least for journalists. The Act reverses the burden of proof - it will be up to the accused to prove their innocence, in other words, to prove a negative. That is not all. The definition of terrorism in the bill includes \"the use or threat, for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, or ideological cause, of action which involves serious violence against any person or property\". This could embrace not only armed extremists but also environmental activists attacking GM crops. For the first time, the term \"terrorism\" will apply to domestic groups which can be proscribed by the home secretary. It will be an offence to \"provide money or other property\" which may be used \"for the purposes of terrorism\" and not tell the police when you suspect others of doing so. It will be a criminal offence to speak at the same meeting as someone from a proscribed organisation. This will have the peculiar result of making it a criminal offence to oppose such an organisation. The meeting could be of no more than three people, private or public. It could be an informal gathering or a discussion in a pub. The Act also introduces a criminal offence of \"incitement\" - an offence which could catch, for example, anyone calling for the overthrow of undemocratic regimes abroad. It would have caught Nelson Mandela and other ANC leaders who supported armed struggle against the apartheid regime in South Africa. The Act gives the police an array of sweeping new powers and in effect sets up a parallel criminal justice system wide open to abuse and far beyond the provisions of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. It gives them stop and search powers on the basis of \"expediency\" and of \"suspicion\", not of committing any offence, but of being connected, or potentially connected, to the bill's vague description of \"terrorism\". The Act, says Wadham, \"creates a two-tier system - in which people suspected of a criminal act for moral or political reasons will have less rights than someone who commits a similar crime for reasons of lust, greed or viciousness\". By concentrating on motivation, it includes activity which the vast majority of the public would not regard as terrorism, while excluding gangs of racketeers or drug-runners, for example, engaged in serious criminal activities.

Egg has struggled to prove that web-based banking can work and has failed to make an advantage of the \"first mover\" status it acquired when it launched three years ago. Despite adding insurance, mortgages and joint credit-card ventures to its services, Egg today reported a full-year pre-tax loss of \u00a3155.3m, up from \u00a3149.7m in 1999. However, Egg emphasised its customer base had soared from 790,000 to 1.35m, while the UK is falling further in love with the net. \"A recent study by MORI estimates 23 million people will be online by the middle of 2001 and 14 million are expecting to use a new technology product for the first time,\" said Paul Gratton, chief executive of Egg. Egg has gained a high profile with an off-the-wall advertising campaign, which drew a series of complaints from the public. People claimed the commercials, which featured a man jumping into bed with a customer, were sinister. However, analysts were looking for a more old-fashioned approach to business in the results, and they got it with a statement about the company's timescale for reaching profitability. Egg said it would reach profit by the end of 2001 and will seek continental partners for an aggressive expansion into Europe. \"We fully intend to become a global business,\" said Mr Gratton. \"We are exploring commercial partnerships with a number of significant European businesses.\" Rival operations such as Co-op's Smile and Abbey National's Cahoot have stolen some of Egg's thunder. However, Egg is growing fast - it added 100,000 customers in 2001. \"We have the strength of proposition, speed of delivery and stamina of management team to ensure Egg will be a winner in the digital economy,\" said Mr Gratton.",

      "bodyText": "BBC1's latest Sunday evening drama, Best of Both Worlds, failed to dent the ratings of ITV's London's Burning last night. The long running ITV fire-service drama was watched by 10m, while Best of Both Worlds managed only 5.3m, according to unofficial overnights. The BBC drama, written by acclaimed Cracker scriptman Paul Abbott, centred on the woes of an air stewardess with husbands in both London and Bologna. The protagonist is played by rising star Alice Evans. But the first instalment of a three-part drama mustered just a 21% share, yet again demonstrating the stranglehold ITV has on Sunday night family viewing. London's Burning clinched a 41% share between 9pm and 10pm. Viewing figures for the long-runnng ITV drama were up 300,000 week on week. The Sunday night schedules also played host to that rare beast, a home-grown Channel 5 drama. Hotel - which went out over 90 minutes from 9pm - starred Paul McGann, Art Malik and Lee Majors in a tale of incompetent terrorists who take the US president hostage in a suburban English hotel. It notched up a respectable 1.2m viewers and a 5% share. Channel 4 also scored last night with the terrestrial premiere of controversial Las Vegas lap-dance extravaganza Showgirls from 10pm. The movie gained 2.4m viewers and a 21% share.",

The biggest selling teen magazines have sold astronomically well, with Attic Futura's Sugar peaking at over 420,000.

Los primeros a\u00f1os ped\u00eda papeles para ser legal, pero despu\u00e9s se cans\u00f3 de intentarlo. Trabajaba de barrendero en un mercado. Hace unos d\u00edas fue la polic\u00eda al mercado y lo mand\u00f3 de vuelta a Marruecos\", explica el joven inmigrante Joumad. Desde finales de enero la ley espa\u00f1ola permite expulsar en cuarenta y ocho horas a los inmigrantes ilegales o sin papeles en el pa\u00eds. Y trabajar sin permiso es, con la nueva ley, una infracci\u00f3n grave. Miles de inmigrantes en Espa\u00f1a viven ahora con la amenaza de la expulsi\u00f3n. Sonia, Joumad y Jos\u00e9 estudian en la escuela Miquel Tarradell, de Barcelona. Un setenta por ciento de los estudiantes de esta escuela son inmigrantes. Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 ense\u00f1a espa\u00f1ol a inmigrantes en Algeciras. \u00bfCrees que la inmigraci\u00f3n es un problema para Espa\u00f1a? Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 (Tiene 16 a\u00f1os y es de Algeciras): S\u00ed, porque existen prejuicios. La gente dice que quitan empleo, que ensucian las calles... Compa\u00f1eras de clase hablan de la invasi\u00f3n de los \"moros\". A ellos no les gusta la palabra \"moro\", sino marroqu\u00ed o \u00e1rabe. Algeciras es una ciudad de paso de los inmigrantes que cruzan el estrecho con pateras desde Marruecos. Por eso desde hace dos a\u00f1os soy voluntaria de Andaluc\u00eda Acoge. Algunos se aprovechan de nosotros, pero otros realmente lo necesitan. Jos\u00e9 (Tiene 15 a\u00f1os y es de Barcelona): La gente cree que los de fuera har\u00e1n algo malo. Pero la mayor\u00eda de inmigrantes no crean problemas. Pagan justos por pecadores. Sonia (Tiene 15 a\u00f1os y es de India. Lleg\u00f3 a Barcelona hace tres a\u00f1os): El problema es para los que llegan sin papeles. \u00bfQu\u00e9 opini\u00f3n tienes de la nueva Ley de Extranjer\u00eda? Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9: Hasta ahora los inmigrantes primero buscaban trabajo y despu\u00e9s ped\u00edan los papeles. Ahora ya no es posible. Joumad (Tiene 17 a\u00f1os y es de Marruecos): Para tener papeles necesitas trabajo, y para tener trabajo necesitas papeles. Es un pez que se muerde la cola. Sonia: Hay inmigrantes que viven aqu\u00ed desde hace a\u00f1os y no les dan papeles. La nueva ley les obliga a volver a sus pa\u00edses, pero no quieren. Por eso han empezado una huelga de hambre.

Go beat your head on Jerusalem's Wailing Wall. A fresh generation of fighters - radicalised by the TV pictures they see of dead kids in Baghdad or Gaza - is taking over.

Of course the oil made intervention more self-serving than it would have been in, say, the Congo, but the world beyond America guzzles gas as well. And, whatever Dick Cheney may believe, Bush was right to stop the carnage when he did. The cost of visible slaughter had simply grown too great.</p> <p>What was wrong - inevitable, but wrong - was the way that this half-victory turned to domestic politicking and froze into intellectual immobility. Saddam became a satanic totem in a personalised standoff, the man who could be given no quarter and no fresh thought. He could be bombed by a successor president in an impeachment jam. (A missile a day keeps Gallup pollsters at bay). He could be bombed by a new president wanting to show his mettle.</p> <p>As he was demonised, though, his shadow grew longer. Military machines and lapdog defence contractors used him and his like to burnish their budgets. So Son of Star Wars arises with the son of George.</p> <p>The difficulty here, the root of all difficulty, is not rooted in cynicism, however. Examine what George W Bush says and reckon that, for the most part he believes it and speaks for most his nation's citizens. \"Our world, shaped by American courage, power and wisdom, today echoes with American ideals. We won a victory not just for a country, but for a vision: a vision of freedom and individual dignity. For us, this is a time of unrivalled military power, economic promise and cultural influence. It is, in Franklin Roosevelt's phrase, 'the peace of overwhelming victory'. Our noble challenge [now] is to turn these years of influence into decades of peace.\"</p> <p>But what, once the rhetoric of his most magisterial pre-election speech on foreign affairs had ended, was the first pre-condition he cited? \"Building a durable peace,\" he said, \"will require strong alliances.\" It would, in sum, require a meeting of minds and a pooling of interests. And the devilish difficulty, as he looks around the globe this morning, is that \"strong\" alliances grow weaker.</p> <p>The Tony Blair who turns up in Washington this week seeking his own pre-election moment in the sun, is the only one left (bar Ariel Sharon) playing inflexible friend. The rest of Europe grows restive; Russia and China scowl; Japan and India frown; the Middle East is in anxious uproar. That isn't just because Saddam got zapped this time with (as opposed to without) publicity: it is because America, with power but too little wisdom, has begun to see its \"ideals\" and \"cultural influence\" as the only shows in town. There's no strength to alliances built that way.</p> <p>Inevitably, this week, British commentators writing in British newspapers will bang on about the \"special relationship\" and Mr Blair's anxiety (like the anxiety of his predecessors) to play governor of the 51st state, always there, always agreeable. That, bobbing back and forth between Brussels and Washington, is our self-appointed \"special\" role and special cross. But what shrieks to be on the agenda now is more than PR spin. Blair needs to be the interpreter of Europe to America, not the bearer of mere messages back.</p> <p>The better agenda was conveniently laid out last month in a policy brief - A Transatlantic New Deal - for the Foreign Policy Centre. What is the \"burden sharing\" that the US bangs on about? Is it troops and firepower alone or overseas development assistance? EU countries give $27bn a year to overseas projects: the US gives $9bn (just 0.1% of GDP to the ODA). Is it curbing greenhouse gases and global warming?</p> <p>The plain fact is that there is already far more sharing of the global burden than George W (or his Pentagon) realise. The future fact is that - interpreted beyond mere missile counts - better balances and partnerships are there for the building. But partnerships only come between free and equal partners. What the new boy in the White House and his ancient advisers need to realise is that a partnership which excludes everyone but London and Tel Aviv is no partnership at all. What Tony Blair needs to realise is that standing mutely by his man is a recipe for strife - and for another Saddam, and another, waiting to strike.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:peter.preston@theguardian.com\">peter.preston@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Military machines and lapdog defence contractors used him and his like to burnish their budgets. So Son of Star Wars arises with the son of George. The difficulty here, the root of all difficulty, is not rooted in cynicism, however. Examine what George W Bush says and reckon that, for the most part he believes it and speaks for most his nation's citizens. \"Our world, shaped by American courage, power and wisdom, today echoes with American ideals. We won a victory not just for a country, but for a vision: a vision of freedom and individual dignity. For us, this is a time of unrivalled military power, economic promise and cultural influence. It is, in Franklin Roosevelt's phrase, 'the peace of overwhelming victory'. Our noble challenge [now] is to turn these years of influence into decades of peace.\" But what, once the rhetoric of his most magisterial pre-election speech on foreign affairs had ended, was the first pre-condition he cited? \"Building a durable peace,\" he said, \"will require strong alliances.\" It would, in sum, require a meeting of minds and a pooling of interests. And the devilish difficulty, as he looks around the globe this morning, is that \"strong\" alliances grow weaker. The Tony Blair who turns up in Washington this week seeking his own pre-election moment in the sun, is the only one left (bar Ariel Sharon) playing inflexible friend. The rest of Europe grows restive; Russia and China scowl; Japan and India frown; the Middle East is in anxious uproar. That isn't just because Saddam got zapped this time with (as opposed to without) publicity: it is because America, with power but too little wisdom, has begun to see its \"ideals\" and \"cultural influence\" as the only shows in town. There's no strength to alliances built that way. Inevitably, this week, British commentators writing in British newspapers will bang on about the \"special relationship\" and Mr Blair's anxiety (like the anxiety of his predecessors) to play governor of the 51st state, always there, always agreeable. That, bobbing back and forth between Brussels and Washington, is our self-appointed \"special\" role and special cross. But what shrieks to be on the agenda now is more than PR spin. Blair needs to be the interpreter of Europe to America, not the bearer of mere messages back. The better agenda was conveniently laid out last month in a policy brief - A Transatlantic New Deal - for the Foreign Policy Centre. What is the \"burden sharing\" that the US bangs on about? Is it troops and firepower alone or overseas development assistance? EU countries give $27bn a year to overseas projects: the US gives $9bn (just 0.1% of GDP to the ODA). Is it curbing greenhouse gases and global warming? The plain fact is that there is already far more sharing of the global burden than George W (or his Pentagon) realise. The future fact is that - interpreted beyond mere missile counts - better balances and partnerships are there for the building. But partnerships only come between free and equal partners. What the new boy in the White House and his ancient advisers need to realise is that a partnership which excludes everyone but London and Tel Aviv is no partnership at all. What Tony Blair needs to realise is that standing mutely by his man is a recipe for strife - and for another Saddam, and another, waiting to strike. peter.preston@theguardian.com",

The hit ITV show's ratings dropped by almost 2m viewers when up against the BBC chatshow king. Mr Parkinson opened a 10-week run of his evergreen chatshow with an all-female guest line-up of Tracey Ullman, Denise Lewis and Dolly Parton, between 9.05pm and 10.50pm. Parkinson had 6.8m viewers and a 29% share, according to unofficial overnights Last week, in the same BBC1 slot, a Jonathan Creek repeat managed just 4.7m viewers. Popstars ran between 9.15pm and 10pm on ITV and looked back at the events of January, when the tabloids began to run stories about the five band members' private lives. The reality show slipped a little from the stellar-ratings of the previous two Saturdays, posting 7.9m viewers and a 34% share. The week before, at 7.30pm on Saturday night, Popstars had pulled in 9.7m - two in five viewers. BBC2 again won the weekly Saturday night nostalgia battle with Channel 4. The BBC's I Love 1984 attracted nearly three times as many viewers as Top Ten Eighties Soul between 9.15pm and 10.50pm. I Love 1984, hosted by Frankie Goes to Hollywood singer Holly Johnson, had 3.1m and a 15% share. Channel 4's archive-fest pulled in just 1.1m. Following on at 10.50pm, BBC2's repeated John Hughes bratpack movie the Breakfast Club proved more popular than the 101 Rent Boys documentary on Channel 4. The Breakfast Club had 1.6m viewers and a 14% share from 10.50pm to 12.20am. Channel 4's 101 Rent Boys, which focused on the male prostitutes plying their trade on LA's Santa Monica Boulevard, had 1.1m between 10.50 and 11.50pm.",

The move comes as technology and computing titles across the board have reported depressing ABC circulation figures for the second half of 2000. And on Friday technology publisher Future Network announced it was to cut 350 jobs worldwide. \"The information needs of the home internet user are not being met,\" said Sylvia Auton, managing director of IPC's Country and Leisure Media group. IPC said it believed that the market for a magazine targeted at internet users in the 25-50 age group is as large as 7m. Project Spider is to be edited by Jim Lennox, the former editor of Computeractive. The Project Spider magazine will have an initial print run of 250,000. Mr Lennox rebuffed suggestions that Project Spider could fall prey to the same market conditions that caused the Future Network magazine Project Click to be scrapped before launch. He said Project Spider was launching into a \"completely different market\" from Computeractive and Future's Project Click. He also said that Project Spider was likely to target more female readers. Technology and computing magazines have been badly hit in the latest ABCs, with many titles reporting double-digit circulation drops.",

The 40-year-old boot brand owned by Northamptonshire company R Griggs appointed advertising agency Mustoe Merriman Herring Levy to its account 18 months ago. But MMHL new business director Damian Horner said the new campaign was the first big push the agency has created for the brand. Mr Horner added that previous work has been of a more tactical nature. In April Dr Martens will take over Covent Garden underground station for the whole month, with blanket advertising on poster sites. The brand's flagship London store is situated in the heart of Covent Garden. Exposure, the PR agency appointed to the brand's account in September, will launch a guerrilla marketing campaign in and around Covent Garden. Email viral marketing is also believed to form another strand of the brand's new marketing push. A print advertising campaign by MMHL will run in style press magazines including The Face and iD. R Griggs has also appointed PR agency DLA Upstream to handle its corporate, financial and political affairs. The \u00a36.25m Dr Martens international media account was moved out of Manning Gottlieb Media and into Starcom Motive last June without a pitch.

The broadcaster has secured exclusive live and highlights coverage of the premier rally competition, starting in 2002. Channel 4's \u00a320m investment will cover the cost of buying the rights, plus production and marketing costs. Two years ago, Channel 4 swiped the rights to England's home cricket tests from the BBC. Channel 4 went on to win numerous awards for its new approach to covering the sport. \"Just as we have with cricket, we aim to give the viewers a greater understanding and appreciation of rallying - the techniques, tactics and sheer nerve required to become the best driver in the world,\" said David Kerr, Channel 4 editor of sport. Channel 4 chief executive Michael Jackson added: \"The World Rally Championship has always been a thrilling and hugely popular event. \"However, new technology means we can now transform the coverage of this classic sport and make it accessible to a wider audience.\" The World Rally Championship has 14 rounds, culminating in the British leg, the Rally of Great Britain. Channel 4's coverage will be produced by Chrysalis Television, which makes World Rally programming for international distribution. Chrysalis is also involved in the production of ITV's formula one programming, through the MACh1 joint venture. Channel 4 was awarded the rights contract by World Rally Championship rights holder International Sportsworld Communicators. ISC was recently bought by David Richards from formula one boss Bernie Ecclestone. \"Channel 4's plans include wide-ranging joint marketing initiatives,\" said Mr Richards. \"I am certain that as we develop the programme offering, they will become a benchmark by which other broadcasters are judged.\"",

      "trailText": "<p>As Labour plays down its plans to fight the next election in cyberspace, <strong>Matthew Tempest</strong> shows how all British parties can learn the lessons of US political campaigning on the internet</p>",
      "byline": "Matthew Tempest",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>For a contest that was supposed to herald online political campaigning, the US presidential election was more like a return to the industrial revolution. Its enduring images were of mechanical machines counting pile after pile of disputed ballot papers and pregnant chads. </p> <p> But before the dark days of Florida, the US did offer web evangelists a taste of future elections. And since the US is five years ahead of the world with anything web-related, the results are being studied by party strategists in the UK. </p> <p>Both Democrats and Republicans invested heavily in web campaigning during the election. But a survey by America's e-Voter institute - a non-partisan company promoting the use of the internet as a political tool for campaigning and analysis - found that their investment yielded disappointing results. Gore's adverts enticed Republican supporters to vote for Bush, and vice versa: 60% of Democrats who saw online adverts for Bush voted for Gore. </p> <p>From the industry's point of view, the only good news was that swing voters who identified themselves as Democrats were 18% more likely to vote for Gore once they had seen an online advert. The same figure for swing voters who identified themselves as Republicans was 4%.</p> <p> The survey tracked 40,000 customers of Juno Online Services, a free ISP in the US that required users to allow their surfing habits to be tracked, from June to November 2000. Participants registered their sympathies before the study began and their exposure to advertising was then monitored, and voting behaviour tracked after the election.</p> <p> The apparent adverse reaction threw Labour's Millbank appratchiks into a tizzy two weeks ago as they rushed to deny reports that they would abandon a top-secret internet advertising blitz. </p> <p>But Dennis Kavanagh, professor of politics and communication studies at Liverpool University, believes they have had a rethink. </p> <p> \"The Labour party was intending to use this general election as a prototype for five years' time where we really could see some proactive marketing on the web,\" he says. \"That's now on the back burner as strategists realise that these ads, especially the pop-up-style ones, are very potent but need to be handled with care because people find them irritating.\" </p> <p> That view is partially borne out by the latest findings from Forrester Internet User Monitor, which shows that 51% of British net users object to pop-up banners or internet advertising. American online strategist Steve Clift, who runs Web, White and Blue - a consortium of American political portals - believes much of the time and effort of website designers was misguided and that a simple email list was often the best form of online campaigning. </p> <p>He says: \"The key element is to register email details and create an electronic loop of information. The Gore website was beautiful to look at and very features-rich, whereas the Bush site was more message-orientated with a 2m sign-up target for emails.\" </p> <p>Clift's own research shows that while just 15% of the American online public visited a political site, 50% sent or received a political email. That fact is not lost on Conservative Central Office, which last week launched a William Hague audio-email urging supporters to save the pound - and forward the email. </p> <p> Labour denies shelving its internet campaign (the official line being that since no details of what it had planned had been released, no change of direction had taken place) and is now keen to play up a policy of letting webmasters put \"Labour party sign up email\" boxes on their sites. A spokesman for its election strategy team says:</p> <p> \"It's something we've been studying carefully for years. There are so many styles of internet advertising - banners on non-political websites, pop-ups, email lists, click through, region-specific ads - but you have the same dilemmas in the new medium as you do in the old. You know what they say, 'In advertising, half the money you spend is wasted, it's a question of which half.'

      "bodyText": "For a contest that was supposed to herald online political campaigning, the US presidential election was more like a return to the industrial revolution. Its enduring images were of mechanical machines counting pile after pile of disputed ballot papers and pregnant chads. But before the dark days of Florida, the US did offer web evangelists a taste of future elections. And since the US is five years ahead of the world with anything web-related, the results are being studied by party strategists in the UK. Both Democrats and Republicans invested heavily in web campaigning during the election. But a survey by America's e-Voter institute - a non-partisan company promoting the use of the internet as a political tool for campaigning and analysis - found that their investment yielded disappointing results. Gore's adverts enticed Republican supporters to vote for Bush, and vice versa: 60% of Democrats who saw online adverts for Bush voted for Gore. From the industry's point of view, the only good news was that swing voters who identified themselves as Democrats were 18% more likely to vote for Gore once they had seen an online advert. The same figure for swing voters who identified themselves as Republicans was 4%. The survey tracked 40,000 customers of Juno Online Services, a free ISP in the US that required users to allow their surfing habits to be tracked, from June to November 2000. Participants registered their sympathies before the study began and their exposure to advertising was then monitored, and voting behaviour tracked after the election. The apparent adverse reaction threw Labour's Millbank appratchiks into a tizzy two weeks ago as they rushed to deny reports that they would abandon a top-secret internet advertising blitz. But Dennis Kavanagh, professor of politics and communication studies at Liverpool University, believes they have had a rethink. \"The Labour party was intending to use this general election as a prototype for five years' time where we really could see some proactive marketing on the web,\" he says. \"That's now on the back burner as strategists realise that these ads, especially the pop-up-style ones, are very potent but need to be handled with care because people find them irritating.\" That view is partially borne out by the latest findings from Forrester Internet User Monitor, which shows that 51% of British net users object to pop-up banners or internet advertising. American online strategist Steve Clift, who runs Web, White and Blue - a consortium of American political portals - believes much of the time and effort of website designers was misguided and that a simple email list was often the best form of online campaigning. He says: \"The key element is to register email details and create an electronic loop of information. The Gore website was beautiful to look at and very features-rich, whereas the Bush site was more message-orientated with a 2m sign-up target for emails.\" Clift's own research shows that while just 15% of the American online public visited a political site, 50% sent or received a political email. That fact is not lost on Conservative Central Office, which last week launched a William Hague audio-email urging supporters to save the pound - and forward the email. Labour denies shelving its internet campaign (the official line being that since no details of what it had planned had been released, no change of direction had taken place) and is now keen to play up a policy of letting webmasters put \"Labour party sign up email\" boxes on their sites. A spokesman for its election strategy team says: \"It's something we've been studying carefully for years. There are so many styles of internet advertising - banners on non-political websites, pop-ups, email lists, click through, region-specific ads - but you have the same dilemmas in the new medium as you do in the old. You know what they say, 'In advertising, half the money you spend is wasted, it's a question of which half.' The main website is a fantastic resource for getting your message across unmediated by the press and broadcasters, and for telling constituencies exactly what cuts the Tories are planning in their home town. We would be silly not to enlarge it in the years to come - especially if you look at projected rates of growth and penetration.\" David Walter, head of communications and chief strategist for the Liberal Democrats, agrees: \"For the LibDems, everything has to come back to finances.

But one minute he was Radio 1's hottest property, the next he was off the airwaves and disappearing in to obscurity. </p> <p>Ten years on from his Radio 1 heyday, most people will only be familiar with him because his name has been raked through the mud by his ex-girlfriend, the publicity-paramour Anthea Turner, who decided to tell the world that their relationship was no bed of roses. </p> <p>Brookes is understandably bitter, but shrugs off the chance to get even (in this interview at least). \"The public made their own mind up about that one. It's best to leave it in the past,\" he says, unable to resist adding: \"And I haven't seen her in the media since.\" Perhaps he is smiling inwardly when he says this, but his expression never changes from dead-pan business Bruno; the serious Bruno who now runs a digital broadcast company which employs 40 people. </p> <p>We meet at his London office in swanky New Bond Street, where the walls are plastered with platinum records and the latest in technology sits around begging to be played with. I recognise him straight away. He's the same diminutive, button nosed, clean shaven man that I grew up with. The only difference is a well-fed waistline and a receding hairline, framed by a halo of inch-long hair where once sat his trademark bouffant. </p> <p>First things first, he says, I have to smoke a rollup. He seems to like the fact that previous profiles of him have always kicked off with reference to his Golden Virginia habit. We then get down to the business of the interview. He tells me about his internet radio station, StormLive, and his growing business empire, Storm Digital Music, that he hopes to float on the stock market later this year. </p> <p>Bruno (real name Trevor) comes from the Smashy and Nicey days of Radio 1; the old-school fraternity which counts Tony Blackburn, Peter Powell, Gary Davies, Dave Lee Travis and Simon Bates among its paid-up members. They were the glory days of Radio 1, days that have never been seen since. </p> <p>It must have been something of a comedown. </p> <p>Brookes laughs off this suggestion - he doesn't care if people don't recognise him. \"Being in the limelight can be a pain in the arse,\" he says. \"It's not what turns me on anymore. What turns me on now is getting results in a different way.\" </p> <p>When he left London for Berkshire after his unceremonious departure from Radio 1, Brookes began his show Bruno at the Mill House and kitted out the whole house with microphones - even in the toilet and bedroom - so he could move around while presenting it. Each week, he broadcast 14 shows on Emap's regional radio stations. </p> <p>Eventually, the business outgrew the house so he moved into studios at Newbury, and expanded into broadcast training and design. He'd already come across the internet a few years before, and it had got him thinking of ways to take the business online. </p> <p>Like most entrepreneurial tales, Storm came from an idea on a napkin in a restaurant. It was early 1999 and, with three music industry friends, he mapped out his future: radio across all emerging platforms. </p> <p>Brookes is now the managing director of Storm Digital Broadcasting, a role that seems to satisfy him. \"I get a serious buzz out of taking this forward but there's never enough hours in every day at the moment,\" he says. He also presents a weekly fishing show on Sky Sports. </p> <p>The core of Storm's current strategy is to partner with other companies, such as portals, to bring a ready-made audience to the StormLive station. It is distributed on, among others, Freeserve, Sky Digital, MyKindaplace.com and Newsoftheworld.com. </p> <p>The next step is to expand into new territories. He's firming up plans to roll out Storm Sweden and move into India and South Africa. Plans are also in place to start selling licensed music by digital download. </p> <p>Another direction is to develop Reality Radio, Brookes' take on Reality TV. Installing moviecams into StormLive's studios was the first step, he says, but he's not very forthcoming with further details. </p> <p>\"That would be giving the game away,\" he says, \"If I talk about it I'll give ideas away and the shareholders will rip me apart. It's premature to say what they are, all I can say is it's 'where marketing meets media'.\" </p> <p>Brookes is also unwilling to talk about the number of listeners his new station has attracted. Three times I ask for the figures, only for my question to be neatly evaded: \"We will let you know at the end of the month when we get our audit through. At the moment I don't know myself.\" Unlikely, but then he's being guarded, playing the shrewd businessman, and all will be revealed when it suits the company. </p> <p>Brookes plays the role well. He speaks in the latest techno-jargon and comes across as a man who actually understands what he's talking about. He's excited about 3G and what it can mean for digital radio; he's watching Japanese mobile operator NTT DoCoMo, and he follows market developments on ADSL and unmetered access. </p> <p>Very early on in his career, even when he was still at Radio 1, Brookes recognised that he wasn't going to be a DJ forever and began thinking of other ways of taking his life forward. \"To not start educating myself would have been a mistake. No disrespect, but I knew all along I was not going to end up like Tony Blackburn or Fluff. They didn't have anything else to fall back on.\" </p> <p>\"Thank God we've moved forward,\" says Brookes. He's also glad that radio is no longer just about FM and AM frequencies. \"Radio, to me, has become a little bit format-oriented. But new technologies open it all up.\" It's at this point he throws in Storm's tagline: \"Different not Dangerous. The future has no frequency.\" I hastily change the subject. </p> <p>What does he think of radio in the UK? \"There's some great radio in this country, but there's also some bloody bad radio.\" What's his relationship like with that other Radio 1 DJ turned media entrepreneur, Peter Powell? \"We're both busy blokes. It's mostly media bullshit between me and Peter. One thing's for certain, though, Worldpop [Powell's music website] should carry Stormlive. Peter, call me...\" </p> <p>The impression I leave Storm with is that Bruno Brookes is incredibly driven to achieve his ambition: to build a big broadcasting company. The only thing he won't do for his company, however, is go back into the studio - despite being asked many times by Storm's programme director to do a show. \"I won't go anywhere near that studio,\" he says, adding quite resolutely, \"I'm a crap DJ now.\"</p>",

At the moment I don't know myself.\" Unlikely, but then he's being guarded, playing the shrewd businessman, and all will be revealed when it suits the company. Brookes plays the role well. He speaks in the latest techno-jargon and comes across as a man who actually understands what he's talking about. He's excited about 3G and what it can mean for digital radio; he's watching Japanese mobile operator NTT DoCoMo, and he follows market developments on ADSL and unmetered access. Very early on in his career, even when he was still at Radio 1, Brookes recognised that he wasn't going to be a DJ forever and began thinking of other ways of taking his life forward. \"To not start educating myself would have been a mistake. No disrespect, but I knew all along I was not going to end up like Tony Blackburn or Fluff. They didn't have anything else to fall back on.\" \"Thank God we've moved forward,\" says Brookes. He's also glad that radio is no longer just about FM and AM frequencies. \"Radio, to me, has become a little bit format-oriented. But new technologies open it all up.\" It's at this point he throws in Storm's tagline: \"Different not Dangerous. The future has no frequency.\" I hastily change the subject. What does he think of radio in the UK? \"There's some great radio in this country, but there's also some bloody bad radio.\" What's his relationship like with that other Radio 1 DJ turned media entrepreneur, Peter Powell? \"We're both busy blokes. It's mostly media bullshit between me and Peter. One thing's for certain, though, Worldpop [Powell's music website] should carry Stormlive. Peter, call me...\" The impression I leave Storm with is that Bruno Brookes is incredibly driven to achieve his ambition: to build a big broadcasting company. The only thing he won't do for his company, however, is go back into the studio - despite being asked many times by Storm's programme director to do a show. \"I won't go anywhere near that studio,\" he says, adding quite resolutely, \"I'm a crap DJ now.\"",

Mr Holt, a former news director at New York station 1010WINS, which pioneered rolling radio news, was the launch manager of the ITN rolling news service on News Direct. He will work with ITN marketing director David Robinson and Richard Tait in developing ITN World News, the ITN service sold to the US's PBS network that has made a star out of presenter Daljit Dhaliwal. Stuart Thomas, editor of LBC 1152AM, will take over as editor of News Direct. The two stations are owned by London News Radio, in which ITN is a major shareholder. Mr Holt's move follows reports that News Direct was forced to make a u-turn on a strategy that would have seen it replacing live programming with a feed from ITN News Channel overnight and at weekends. It is understood that the plans were shelved following objections from the Radio Authority. An ITN spokesman denied Mr Holt had been moved as a result of the change in strategy at News Direct on substituting the News Channel feed for live programmes. \"With Steve's knowledge and experience, he is by far the best candidate to take on this role in what is a major area of growth for ITN,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "Foreign policy analysts in the US said the air strikes on Iraqi radar installations around Baghdad had, by suppressing the immediate threat to allied aircraft, given the new administration a breathing space to decide how to fulfil George Bush's campaign promise to \"get tougher\" with Saddam Hussein's regime. But with Iraqi opposition groups as weak as ever and the raft of sanctions springing new leaks with every passing day, it is clear there will be no easy way to break the 10-year deadlock with Baghdad. US defence officials said that US and British pilots patrolling the no-fly zones had noticed a sharp increase in anti-aircraft fire in the past six weeks. On average last year, the Iraqis fired one surface-to-air missile at coalition planes a month. This year they had already fired 13, and there had been a significant increase in anti-aircraft shells. Furthermore, an increasing number of near-misses suggested that the Iraqis' aim was improving. \"It was really only a matter of time before they got lucky, and one of our pilots was shot down. It was not a sustainable situation,\" a Pentagon official said. The air strikes reflected an increasing reliance on a new generation of long-range precision-guided air-to-ground missiles, the AGM-130 and the navy's AGM-154A, which allow US planes to hit distant targets without exposing themselves to close anti-aircraft fire. Shooting down an allied pilot would be a public relations triumph for President Saddam in the Arab world, where he is portraying himself as a bastion of resistance to Israel and the US. It would also push the US administration into fulfiling its election pledge to \"do something\" about Saddam sooner before it had agreed on a feasible policy. Mr Bush's foreign policy team is currently pursuing two main policy tracks. The secretary of state, Colin Powell, favours tightening the use of sanctions, and his first foreign trip at the end of this week is to be a tour of the Middle East, in an attempt to persuade other Arab states to help enforce the UN restrictions on the export of Iraqi oil. The embargo is showing increasing signs of wear. Walid Khadduri, editor of the Middle East Economic Survey, estimates that Iraq is selling more than 400,000 barrels of oil a day outside the UN oil-for-food programme, of which 150,000 barrels are passing through a Syrian pipeline reopened in November with Iraqi help. The Iraqi regime is pocketing more than $1bn (\u00a3700m) a year from the smuggling, and is raising more money by imposing a surcharge of 25 to 30 cents a barrel on oil traders handling Iraq's legal exports under the oil-for-food programme. Mr Powell is due to visit Syria and plans to raise US concern about the pipeline, but it will be hard to persuade Damascus to comply, after the collapse of Israeli-Syrian peace talks and the election in Israel of Ariel Sharon, who is reviled in the Arab world. The other policy track being explored is increasing support for Iraqi resistance groups, in the hope of undermining President Saddam's regime from within Iraq. The policy is most fiercely advocated by the new defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, and his deputy, Paul Wolfowitz, who were behind the 1998 Iraq Liberation Act, earmarking $97m (\u00a367m) in aid, mostly for the Iraqi National Congress (INC) coalition. Very little of it was disbursed by the Clinton administration, which had little confidence in the faction-ridden opposition movement. On Friday, while the bombing raid was under way, the INC leader, Ahmed Chalabi, was meeting Edward Walker, the assistant secretary of state for Near East affairs. Mr Chalabi said later that he had been given the green light to spend more than $30m, much of it for operations inside Iraq. But most Iraq analysts believe the aid is of mainly symbolic importance and have serious doubts about the effectiveness of the INC and other opposition groups.

Every bomb that falls strengthens the Iraqi dictator's claim to pan-Arab leadership in defiance of a supposedly hostile western imperialism. Every long-range cruise or \"stand-off\" air-launched missile merely emphasises Washington's fear of sustaining casualties or losing hostages in an unwinnable war fought at a safe distance. Saddam knows very well that a large-scale land invasion of Iraq by allied ground troops like that begun and halted in 1991, the only sure way to unseat him, is no longer feasible. How amusing he must find current US talk of funding and infiltrating Iraqi opposition groups more accustomed to sipping coffee in well-appointed London apartments. Every raid increases the discomfort of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, squirmingly reluctant hosts to the allied planes. Far from reminding Saddam of his enemies' power and resolve, every sortie reminds a watching world of America's bankrupt policy of bombs and sanctions.</p> <p>All of which is deeply worrying for Britain given its uniquely close association with this US policy which many European allies, as well as Russia and China, fiercely oppose. Tony Blair says he acted to defend RAF pilots against an increased threat in the no-fly zones. But, legally speaking, their presence there has no specific UN or other authorisation. Robin Cook says Britain has a humanitarian mission to protect the southern Shia and the Kurds against Saddam's depredations. But this justification relates to the situation 10 years ago. Saddam suppressed the Shia long ago; and the biggest threat to the Kurds is the Turks (and other Kurds). The government has a duty to protect our armed forces. But it has an equal duty not to put them in harm's way unnecessarily. Paradoxically, Britain recently warned the US that the no-fly zone patrols were becoming unacceptably hazardous, even pointless. But instead of taking the rational course and ending them, George Bush decided to use new, secretly agreed rules of engagement to expand them.</p> <p>The resulting, highly escalatory attacks on targets near Baghdad cannot be supported as a matter of law or common sense. They do absolutely nothing to help end Saddam's undoubtedly dangerous tyranny. They diminish the chances that imminent UN talks with Iraq on a resumption of weapons inspections will succeed. They will do nothing to curb the rampant oil smuggling upon which Saddam is once again growing strong. They undermine the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, who may have hoped to rally support for less indiscriminately punitive, arms-focused sanctions during his Middle East visit this week. They increase tension and instability in a region already reeling from the Palestinian intifada and Ariel Sharon's triumph in Israel. Oddly, the attacks did not target chemical and biological weapons facilities that the US says Saddam is rebuilding. Since the proliferation of such mass terror weapons is America's principal stated security concern, why were these alleged factories not bombed? That at least would have been understandable.</p> <p>Worrying for Britain, too, is what this irresponsible action says about the insecure, aggressive mindset of the new administration in Washington. In a sense Mr Bush was testing Mr Blair's loyalty, sucking him back into a conflict he has no mandate to fight. When the two men meet for the first time later this week, the president is likely to want more oaths of fealty, seeking British acquiescence in his globally destabilising missile defence plans, for example, in his intention to disengage in the Balkans and in his apparent belief that Nato has a right of veto over the EU's military aspirations. Increasingly, this domineering American security agenda does not serve Britain's interests, nor that of Britain's European partners. This latest episode in Iraq starkly demonstrates that. Seeking to be special friends with Mr Bush is all very well. But not at any price, Mr Blair.

      "byline": "Belinda Archer",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>This Thursday, Levi's unveils its latest advertising campaign - the third burst of activity to back the groovy new \"twisted\" Engineered Jeans. Typically for a brand which made a fortune through its ads in the 80s, the TV work is visually striking, set to a funky soundtrack and by one of the hottest directors around, Frank Budgen. And at \u00a35m it is the most expensively post-produced campaign Levi's has ever made. </p> <p>But despite the money, the great look and the kicking track, the crux of the ad is in the final frame. In the last split-second the camera focuses fleetingly on a hairy gonk, sporting his own, mini Engineered Jeans, dangling from the rear-view mirror of a car. This creature, my friends, is Twisted Boy and, believe me, he is going to be big. </p> <p>From later this week he will have his own website and online game, will feature on in-store promotional material and will be the subject of a comprehensive viral campaign. Surfers in possession of a closely-guarded password will be able to log on, play about with his twisty limbs - developing the creative idea from the commercial - and watch him jig about to various tracks. To get the password punters will have to be one of a tight circle of opinion-leaders who have already been sent a mystery email (a j-peg of a limb, in fact) incorporating the website address and key word. The eagle-eyed will also be able to spot the microsite address written on a wall somewhere in the actual commercial itself. </p> <p>Other activity is planned for our new friend, but the fact that Levi's, the gold standard in knock-em-dead TV executions, is turning to the internet to extend the impact of its advertising reflects a key trend among advertisers for using the web to give their commercials extra clout. </p> <p>In December, John West Salmon had a minimal airing of a TV spot featuring a John West worker fighting a bear for a salmon. This tiny spend was magnified by the ad being sent round virally, cropping up in Asia and Australasia and other far-flung markets. Lowe Lintas' \"belly\" spot for Reebok, depicting a giant inflated belly hotly pursuing a jogger, has similarly been spun off onto the web, featuring on Reebok's official website but also being emailed to 100 key target-group consumers. Nike has also experimented with inviting viewers to vote for the ending of several TV commercials on its website, while Budweiser's whassup has so far triggered 38 unofficial spoofs that are still being emailed around the globe. </p> <p>Websites which focus on advertising are doing much to fan the flames of this trend, in particular the increasingly popular US site adcritic.com which showcases worldwide TV commercials and enables people to download them and send them on. </p> <p>Gwyn Jones, managing director of Bartle Bogle Hegarty, the Levi's ad agency, says: \"Media is fragmenting so much now and delivering an audience is so much harder. It is simply not enough to do a Nick Kamen and have exposure in one channel - you've got to cut through more than that, so your digital strategy is key: you've got to engage them on the internet too.\" </p> <p>The jeanswear giant has, of course, dabbled with the net before: think of the phenomenon that was Flat Eric in 1999. Eric was launched on the web a few weeks before the TV campaign began. But Twisted Boy is a more subtle and sophisticated concept, being just one, digital element of a much larger campaign that embraces traditional posters (starring top models Liberty Ross and Tyson Ballou, no less), plus press and cinema. </p> <p>In short, viral emailing is becoming the new word of mouth - the 21st century equivalent of getting your advertising slogan repeated down the pub - and advertisers are all trying to harness this new potential for the benefit of their own brands. But not all TV campaigns readily lend themselves to such development. </p> <p>Jeremy Bowles, deputy managing director of Lowe Lintas, Reebok's agency, cautions: \"A lot of people think about doing viral marketing but you can't do anything if the idea isn't good enough, otherwise people won't pass it on. And they have to feel rewarded by it, or else they will be irritated and it will backfire.\" </p> <p>In many ways the internet serves as an acid test of how successful a TV ad has been in engaging its audience: the extent to which people take it up and play with it themselves is an indicator of the ad's impact. With whassup, for example, consumers enthusiastically created their own versions, from a Northern \"ey-up\" spoof to a version featuring rabbis exchanging shaloms and a posh variation in which toffee-nosed actors sipped cups of tea instead of downing Buds. </p> <p>Jones adds: \"On the web the test is simply 'do people send it on?'. The intention with Levi's is not to extend its presence online - it's about the pass-on ability of what we've created.\" </p> <p>Many advertisers are actively using the internet as an extension of their TV work, but others are having it done for them - something which can be beneficial but involves losing creative control. </p> <p>Kate Howe, the deputy managing director of John West's agency Leo Burnett, says: \"Our ad actually gained a life for itself around the world.

      "bodyText": "This Thursday, Levi's unveils its latest advertising campaign - the third burst of activity to back the groovy new \"twisted\" Engineered Jeans. Typically for a brand which made a fortune through its ads in the 80s, the TV work is visually striking, set to a funky soundtrack and by one of the hottest directors around, Frank Budgen. And at \u00a35m it is the most expensively post-produced campaign Levi's has ever made. But despite the money, the great look and the kicking track, the crux of the ad is in the final frame. In the last split-second the camera focuses fleetingly on a hairy gonk, sporting his own, mini Engineered Jeans, dangling from the rear-view mirror of a car. This creature, my friends, is Twisted Boy and, believe me, he is going to be big. From later this week he will have his own website and online game, will feature on in-store promotional material and will be the subject of a comprehensive viral campaign. Surfers in possession of a closely-guarded password will be able to log on, play about with his twisty limbs - developing the creative idea from the commercial - and watch him jig about to various tracks. To get the password punters will have to be one of a tight circle of opinion-leaders who have already been sent a mystery email (a j-peg of a limb, in fact) incorporating the website address and key word. The eagle-eyed will also be able to spot the microsite address written on a wall somewhere in the actual commercial itself. Other activity is planned for our new friend, but the fact that Levi's, the gold standard in knock-em-dead TV executions, is turning to the internet to extend the impact of its advertising reflects a key trend among advertisers for using the web to give their commercials extra clout. In December, John West Salmon had a minimal airing of a TV spot featuring a John West worker fighting a bear for a salmon. This tiny spend was magnified by the ad being sent round virally, cropping up in Asia and Australasia and other far-flung markets. Lowe Lintas' \"belly\" spot for Reebok, depicting a giant inflated belly hotly pursuing a jogger, has similarly been spun off onto the web, featuring on Reebok's official website but also being emailed to 100 key target-group consumers. Nike has also experimented with inviting viewers to vote for the ending of several TV commercials on its website, while Budweiser's whassup has so far triggered 38 unofficial spoofs that are still being emailed around the globe. Websites which focus on advertising are doing much to fan the flames of this trend, in particular the increasingly popular US site adcritic.com which showcases worldwide TV commercials and enables people to download them and send them on. Gwyn Jones, managing director of Bartle Bogle Hegarty, the Levi's ad agency, says: \"Media is fragmenting so much now and delivering an audience is so much harder. It is simply not enough to do a Nick Kamen and have exposure in one channel - you've got to cut through more than that, so your digital strategy is key: you've got to engage them on the internet too.\" The jeanswear giant has, of course, dabbled with the net before: think of the phenomenon that was Flat Eric in 1999. Eric was launched on the web a few weeks before the TV campaign began. But Twisted Boy is a more subtle and sophisticated concept, being just one, digital element of a much larger campaign that embraces traditional posters (starring top models Liberty Ross and Tyson Ballou, no less), plus press and cinema. In short, viral emailing is becoming the new word of mouth - the 21st century equivalent of getting your advertising slogan repeated down the pub - and advertisers are all trying to harness this new potential for the benefit of their own brands. But not all TV campaigns readily lend themselves to such development. Jeremy Bowles, deputy managing director of Lowe Lintas, Reebok's agency, cautions: \"A lot of people think about doing viral marketing but you can't do anything if the idea isn't good enough, otherwise people won't pass it on. And they have to feel rewarded by it, or else they will be irritated and it will backfire.\" In many ways the internet serves as an acid test of how successful a TV ad has been in engaging its audience: the extent to which people take it up and play with it themselves is an indicator of the ad's impact. With whassup, for example, consumers enthusiastically created their own versions, from a Northern \"ey-up\" spoof to a version featuring rabbis exchanging shaloms and a posh variation in which toffee-nosed actors sipped cups of tea instead of downing Buds. Jones adds: \"On the web the test is simply 'do people send it on?'. The intention with Levi's is not to extend its presence online - it's about the pass-on ability of what we've created.\" Many advertisers are actively using the internet as an extension of their TV work, but others are having it done for them - something which can be beneficial but involves losing creative control. Kate Howe, the deputy managing director of John West's agency Leo Burnett, says: \"Our ad actually gained a life for itself around the world. We didn't set out to spread it virally, it just happened, but it is good that the ad in totality is being spread. Spoofs can be good, and imitation is a form of flattery, although we would rather control the creative integrity of the brand ourselves.\" But do these internet spin-offs really aid awareness and drive sales, or do they simply serve to entertain a tiny minority of folk (adfolk even) who plainly have time on their hands to fool around with such things? Michele Norman, in-house PR manager for Budweiser, is happy. She says: \"The unofficial whassup spoofs made us seem innovative and creative among our target audience. They built awareness and brand image, as well as adding huge value in terms of column inches to our initial TV campaign.

But that's advertising, and without the surrounding lavish TV campaign Twisted Boy simply could not exist.",

      "byline": "James Meikle, health correspondent",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Death rates from alcohol-related liver disease rose by nearly half in a decade in the United Kingdom, according to World Health Organisation advisers worried by the binge-drinking epidemic in parts of Europe. </p> <p>In England and Wales alone, 33,000 people a year are dying from drink-induced causes, including ill-health, road crashes, violence, alcohol poisoning and other accidents. </p> <p>The advisers report that as many as one in eight deaths among young men across western Europe is related to drink and condemn the \"little bit does you good\" health messages of recent years - saying moderate drinking only helps middle-aged and older people, if any one at all. </p> <p>Tougher advertising rules and higher taxation may be needed to curb consumption, according to papers prepared for a WHO conference opening in Stockholm today. It is being attended by representatives from 51 European countries. </p> <p>These comments reinforce many concerns voiced recently by British doctors worried by a rise in drinking among women, their growing need for hospital treatment for chronic liver disease, and the wider after-work and binge-drinking culture to which young Britons appear increasingly addicted. </p> <p>Overall consumption in the UK has remained fairly constant - with a 1% drop in 10 years - compared with many European neighbours and drink-driving laws have helped bring significant falls in deaths from road accidents. </p> <p>Deaths from cirrhosis and other liver problems - which caused about eight deaths per 100,000 people in 1998, 47% more than in 1988 - are still low compared with most countries. But the rate of increase is worrying and only exceeded by former Eastern bloc states. </p> <p>In addition, a quarter of all people arrested are drunk and half of all violent crime, two-thirds of suicide attempts and 75% of assaults are committed by people under the influence of alcohol. </p> <p>The WHO figures measure consumption in terms of pure alcohol per litre per person, when in reality beers usually range from around 3.5% to 6% alcohol by volume, wines between 10.5% and 13%, and spirits around 40%. The average Briton consumes 7.5 litres a year of alcohol. </p> <p>The WHO is also suspicious about the unrecorded levels of consumption, which may in places such as Hungary be bigger than official figures. But it believes even EU countries such as Austria, France, Italy and Sweden may have slightly higher levels than recorded. </p> <p>Overall alcohol-related deaths among 15- to 29-year-olds will be presented in four main groups of countries by WHO officials. Those for Britain, EU partners and other more developed European states, suggest one in eight male and one in 12 female deaths are drink-related. But in a group including Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, the drink-related toll is one in three male and one in eight female deaths - across the whole of Europe, it is one in four male deaths in the age group. </p> <p>There is mounting concern too about drinking among children. </p> <p>Britain, with few abstainers even in its adult population, is notable for the low numbers of adolescents who have never tried a drink. Well under 10% of 13-year-olds say they have never had alcohol. In addition, one in seven English boys aged 11, one in four Welsh boys of 13 and around a half of 15-year-old boys in England and Wales drink wine, spirit or beer once a week, putting them among the highest youthful consumers in Europe. </p> <p>Cees Goos, WHO regional adviser for alcohol, drugs and tobacco, said: \"We are receiving signals from all across the region that many young people are turning to alcohol as a drug. There is an increase in high-risk drinking, such as binge-drinking and drunkenness.\" </p> <p>The regime of voluntary advertising and sponsorship codes, which Britain relies on to a greater extent than many other countries, is being increasingly called into question by the advisers and voluntary or ganisations. They are concerned at marketing ploys used by such drink giants as Carlsberg and Budweiser during the 1998 World Cup which link drink to sport. The pressure for change is already demonstrated by football's Premier League, which is desperately trying to find a non-alcohol sponsor to replace Carling. </p> <p>There is also concern that the non-stop hedonistic party culture promoted in centres like Ibiza, Spain, Ayia Napa, Cyprus, and Ios in Greece - made easier to attend for young Britons by cheap holiday deals - is storing up trouble. </p> <p>Griffith Edwards, of the Institute of Psychiatry, London, among the authors of the WHO papers, said: \"Within stable and saturated markets, the main role of advertisements is to ensure that old consumers are replaced by new ones and that educational messages do not diminish alcohol consumption...

      "bodyText": "Death rates from alcohol-related liver disease rose by nearly half in a decade in the United Kingdom, according to World Health Organisation advisers worried by the binge-drinking epidemic in parts of Europe. In England and Wales alone, 33,000 people a year are dying from drink-induced causes, including ill-health, road crashes, violence, alcohol poisoning and other accidents. The advisers report that as many as one in eight deaths among young men across western Europe is related to drink and condemn the \"little bit does you good\" health messages of recent years - saying moderate drinking only helps middle-aged and older people, if any one at all. Tougher advertising rules and higher taxation may be needed to curb consumption, according to papers prepared for a WHO conference opening in Stockholm today. It is being attended by representatives from 51 European countries. These comments reinforce many concerns voiced recently by British doctors worried by a rise in drinking among women, their growing need for hospital treatment for chronic liver disease, and the wider after-work and binge-drinking culture to which young Britons appear increasingly addicted. Overall consumption in the UK has remained fairly constant - with a 1% drop in 10 years - compared with many European neighbours and drink-driving laws have helped bring significant falls in deaths from road accidents. Deaths from cirrhosis and other liver problems - which caused about eight deaths per 100,000 people in 1998, 47% more than in 1988 - are still low compared with most countries. But the rate of increase is worrying and only exceeded by former Eastern bloc states. In addition, a quarter of all people arrested are drunk and half of all violent crime, two-thirds of suicide attempts and 75% of assaults are committed by people under the influence of alcohol. The WHO figures measure consumption in terms of pure alcohol per litre per person, when in reality beers usually range from around 3.5% to 6% alcohol by volume, wines between 10.5% and 13%, and spirits around 40%. The average Briton consumes 7.5 litres a year of alcohol. The WHO is also suspicious about the unrecorded levels of consumption, which may in places such as Hungary be bigger than official figures. But it believes even EU countries such as Austria, France, Italy and Sweden may have slightly higher levels than recorded. Overall alcohol-related deaths among 15- to 29-year-olds will be presented in four main groups of countries by WHO officials. Those for Britain, EU partners and other more developed European states, suggest one in eight male and one in 12 female deaths are drink-related. But in a group including Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, the drink-related toll is one in three male and one in eight female deaths - across the whole of Europe, it is one in four male deaths in the age group. There is mounting concern too about drinking among children. Britain, with few abstainers even in its adult population, is notable for the low numbers of adolescents who have never tried a drink. Well under 10% of 13-year-olds say they have never had alcohol. In addition, one in seven English boys aged 11, one in four Welsh boys of 13 and around a half of 15-year-old boys in England and Wales drink wine, spirit or beer once a week, putting them among the highest youthful consumers in Europe. Cees Goos, WHO regional adviser for alcohol, drugs and tobacco, said: \"We are receiving signals from all across the region that many young people are turning to alcohol as a drug. There is an increase in high-risk drinking, such as binge-drinking and drunkenness.\" The regime of voluntary advertising and sponsorship codes, which Britain relies on to a greater extent than many other countries, is being increasingly called into question by the advisers and voluntary or ganisations. They are concerned at marketing ploys used by such drink giants as Carlsberg and Budweiser during the 1998 World Cup which link drink to sport. The pressure for change is already demonstrated by football's Premier League, which is desperately trying to find a non-alcohol sponsor to replace Carling. There is also concern that the non-stop hedonistic party culture promoted in centres like Ibiza, Spain, Ayia Napa, Cyprus, and Ios in Greece - made easier to attend for young Britons by cheap holiday deals - is storing up trouble. Griffith Edwards, of the Institute of Psychiatry, London, among the authors of the WHO papers, said: \"Within stable and saturated markets, the main role of advertisements is to ensure that old consumers are replaced by new ones and that educational messages do not diminish alcohol consumption... Through its messages, it maintains the social desirability of drinking, overshadows the risk of alcohol use to individual and public health, and contradicts prevention initiatives. These indirect effects alone are sufficient to justify the need to control the volume and content of alcohol advertising.\" He said evidence from countries that ban spirit advertising suggested they had 16% lower alcohol consumption than countries with no bans and those with bans on beer and wine advertising had 11% lower alcohol consumption than those with bans only on spirit advertising. The benefits of drinking to protect against heart disease \"if they exist, are likely to be limited to men over 40 years of age and to post-menopausal women and are not population-wide\". The alcohol industry in Britain operates codes meant to stop advertisements suggesting alcohol enhances masculinity or femininity, and insists advertising is to increase brand awareness not consumption. Many other countries ban or restrict advertising - although there are not even voluntary arrangements in Greece, Hungary and Romania. Junior health minister Gisela Stuart is attending the conference that will not be forcing new moves on WHO members. The Department of Health, which will publish its own plans to tackle alcohol abuse this summer, said: \"It is not so much advertising as drinking patterns we want to tackle.\" This would include new measures to tackle under-age drinking and buying of alcohol.

      "bodyText": "The government's insistence that the US and British air strikes against Iraq are justified under international law is less firmly endorsed in Whitehall than ministers admit publicly, informed sources said last night. Private doubts about the legal basis of the no-fly zones over Iraq resurfaced as angry Labour MPs, MEPs and union leaders gave Tony Blair clear signals that they will be much more sceptical about intimate military cooperation with Washington now that a Republican administration is back in power - even though a general election is just weeks away. In public Mr Blair and his senior colleagues argue that the threat to the west from \"rogue states\" such as Iraq is real and leaves Britain and the US \"perfectly entitled to deter aggression\" as the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, put it. Allied arguments have cut little ice around the world as Arab leaders united in opposition to the air strikes and allowed the Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein, to portray himself as victim rather than aggressor. Under the Tories, successive legal advisers, including Lord Williams of Mostyn, the attorney-general, have reassured ministers that the no-fly zones are sanctioned by international law. However authoritative sources said last night: \"They are less confident in private.\" Labour's rank and file is also more sceptical. Bill Morris, leader of the Transport and General Workers' Union, and Glenys Kinnock MEP expressed doubts about Friday night's bombings and the 10-year policy of sanctions which have failed to bring President Saddam to heel. George Galloway, the arabist Labour MP, flew to Baghdad and likened Friday's attack to \"Hitler marching into Czechoslovakia\" in 1939. \"What the British and American governments are doing is reckless, lawless and murderous. If they are not already working for Saddam Hussein then they might as well be because for every bomb that is dropped, Saddam is getting stronger,\" the Glasgow Kelvin MP said. More than 2,000 people - including Iraq's deputy foreign minister, Nabil Najim - protested against the bombings in Baghdad and at least 1,000 other protesters gathered near the offices of the ruling al-Ba'ath party. \"This dangerous aggression shows how much the Americans and Britons hate Iraqis and do not respect any international law,\" Mr Najim told the demonstrators. \"This aggression must be condemned.\" Mr Blair and the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, led a platoon of ministers in defending the US-UK action as necessary to protect their air sorties from anti-aircraft attack by President Saddam's forces - and thereby to save the Kurds of northern Iraq and the southern Shi'ites from his murderous revenge. That is the legal basis which ministers invoke when challenged: the right under international law to intervene to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe such as the use of chemical weapons to kill 5,000 Kurdish villagers in the 1980s when the west still tilted towards President Saddam in his war with Iran. But, the no-fly zones are not specifically sanctioned by any UN security council resolution. Four days before Mr Blair flies into Washington to meet President George Bush, it emerged that Friday's air strikes were cleared by both leaders after requests from military commanders, the RAF as much as the USAF.

The editor will jump at the chance of talking about how the unusual sales curve was the plan all along and how they were just waiting for the rest of the world to catch up with their genius. I won't be doing that. Cos I'd be lying. It's been hell. No, really. </p> <p>Two years ago today Emap put a new magazine out on the shelves of Britain's newsagents. For the next week most of those magazines stayed there - many in the industry reckoned they were actually nailed to those shelves. </p> <p>Post-mortems went on behind the scenes. There were too many words in it. It was too serious. There weren't enough pictures. It was too intense. It was too old.

A year ago we weren't. </p> <p>It's no exclusive that Heat nearly closed. For a while we were the story. We very boldly said from the off that we were aiming for a settle-down figure of 100,000. We had to, about six months after launch, admit we weren't doing anything like that (the figure was more like 65,000). Even the Daily Mirror said we were about to close. </p> <p>Now, 24 months from launch and it's a different tale - a student with a preposterous beard who sings Britney Spears songs in an over-the-top manner is on the cover and people seem to be buying it. I'm not telling you what our secret is, because every magazine has to look at their own market situation and come up with their own. Every magazine's way out of it will be different. But what we can say is that Heat's method involved a brilliant, loyal team working hard every single day, a management team that has allowed me, as boss for the last year, to do my job in peace (it's all about trust) and an MD and editor-in-chief who have been nothing short of inspirational (if the editorial team are in opposition to the management you're buggered sooner or later). But mostly it's about knowing what the reader really wants week in week out. Every editor will tell you there's no bigger thrill than seeing people reading it on buses, raving about it to their friends, talking about it on the radio, writing about us in the papers. Over the past 12 months I genuinely believe we've had more of all of that than any other magazine in Britain. </p> <p>The very best moment of my last 12 months happened while I was walking down New Oxford Street last week. It was a Tuesday and the new issue had just come out. A woman was on her way to work, smoking a fag and reading our transcript of Ali G's hilarious interview with Posh and Becks. I watched her walking along the street smoking and laughing. I also watched helplessly as she walked into a lamp-post. It was at that point that I realised the magazine had become everything we wanted it to be. An unputdownable, sexy, glamorous, must-read. We had become for her - and many like her - utterly irresistible. This year we'd like to think Heat will be causing a lot more people to walk into lamp-posts. We can only apologise in advance.</p>",

      "byline": "John Dugdale",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Are magazine publishers mad? Looking at the latest six-monthly average sales figures, it seems the only feasible explanatory hypothesis. Take, for example, the girls' market, where most editors will have spent the whole night after the ABC stats came out sobbing into their Robbie Williams duvets. A few titles are up, but the vast majority are down - from market leader Sugar's 1.90% year-on-year loss to Live &amp; Kicking's horrendous 29.80% drop, largely attributable to the decline in the Saturday morning show it's linked to. </p> <p>Reasons for the slump are not hard to find: the pop scene is dull, with clone boy bands giving way to clones of clones of clones, and there's a limit to the number of Steps or Britney covers any girl will splash out on; but above all teenagers and tweenagers are spending an increasing amount of time online, finding the kind of celebrity gossip, features and personal experience pieces that mags can provide, alongside the chat rooms and opportunities to meet boys they can't. </p> <p>The number of defectors to the net is bound to increase, and common sense would suggest this is a sector to steer clear of if you're planning a new launch. Yet last year the BBC brought out the teen title Star, the recent debut of Mad About Boys created as big a sensation as the first girl in the playground with a bra, and CosmoGirl! and Elle Girl are both due to arrive this year. Bonkers or what? </p> <p>Seemingly equally demented are publishers eager to add even more titles to the women's monthly sector, described as \"mature\" and \"congested\" for about as long as anyone can remember. For the umpteenth period in succession, sales are generally down, with good results for Company and Elle the only significant exceptions; otherwise publishers are reduced to hailing zero change as success \"in a very competitive market\" and tiny gains as triumphs. The \"Full up\" sign is there for all to see, you'd imagine. Nevertheless, the BBC's Eve and IPC's resuscitated Nova wedged themselves into the crush during 2000, Time Warner premiered In Style last week, and Cond\u00e9 Nast's Glamour will shortly follow. Nurse! </p> <p>And yet. And yet. The possible method in their madness can be discerned if you look at the women's weekly sector, where stale old-style mags with titles beginning with the word 'Woman' have been in decline since at least the 1980s, as elderly readers - wondering on foul wintry mornings whether they feel up to tottering to the newsagent for their copy of Woman's Own - vote with their Zimmer frames. Publishers could easily have looked at the relentlessly dropping ABC figures and stayed well away from the sector. They didn't, though. They saw opportunities. First came the German invasion led by Take a Break and Bella, then magazines such as Now (up 20% in the latest figures) combined tabloid stories with better pictures. </p> <p>Above all, the success of Hello! and OK! revitalised the whole sector, and their impact has spread well beyond it. Without their demonstration of an endless public appetite for celebs, it's hard to imagine publishers nerving themselves to launch such titles as Star, In Style and Heat, all centred on the lifestyles of the rich and famous. </p> <p>Up by a flabbergasting 137.60%, Heat (see box opposite) was far and away the stand-out performer in the July-Dec 2000 ABCs, and its owner Emap had other reasons to be cheerful. FHM, which once looked to have peaked, put on 2% and at 716,679 retains its place in the top 10 of all titles ranked by the number of copies \"actively purchased\" (ie not the result of club membership, etc). Elle added 6.80%, almost identical to its year-on-year gain in the previous period, and It's Bliss, up 4.30%, was one of the few teen titles to post gains. </p> <p>But Smash Hits, down 8.20%, fell victim to the slump in pop-based titles, and of the sinking Wagadon titles acquired by Emap, only the Face (up 8.20%) has recovered. Death Row surely beckons for Arena (down 21.30 to a meagre 37,080); and it's surprising that the publisher which last year deleted Select and Minx has not already put Sky (down 35.20%) out of its misery. Also sliding are the once-healthy women's title Red (down 14%) and teen mag J-17 (13%), suffering double-digit decline for the second consecutive period. </p> <p>IPC had a bit of a stinker, hit by demoralising losses in such prestige titles as Marie Claire (down 11%) and Loaded (5.40%), with further whopping drops at men's mag Later (22.40%) and women's glossies Woman's Journal (14.80%), Essentials (10.50%) and Woman and Home (8.70%). Attempts to reboot NME have so far been in vain, and if it continues to lose 8.20% of its readership every six months it could be heading for the same rock graveyard as its former stablemate Melody Maker. Nova debuted with 75,142, said to be \"on target with launch expectations\". </p> <p>Besides Now's performance, IPC could take some consolation from TV and Satellite Week (up 22.40%) and What's On TV's loss of only 2.30% - far from contemptible in a volatile listings sector recently reinforced by Bauer's 732,259-selling TV Choice - which preserves its position as the No 1 actively purchased title with a monstrous ABC of 1,701,064. </p> <p>But this goodish news was offset by grim figures from TV Times, which shed 12.90% of its circulation. Its longstanding rival Radio Times (down 5.40%) also drooped, scarcely improving the glum mood at BBC Worldwide. The Beeb's magazines were the worst hit by girls getting bored by pop, with Top of the Pops chasing Live and Kicking downwards in losing 17.20%. </p> <p>Cond\u00e9 Nast experienced mixed fortunes, achieving significant rises at Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller (19.70%) and Vanity Fair (8%), but falls at Tatler (3.60%) and GQ (1.40%). As did National Magazines, where the outstanding result was Company's 8% gain, strikingly reversing the previous period's 4.80% year-on-year loss. The slippage at Marie Claire meant that NatMags' Cosmopolitan was able to extend its lead at the head of the sector despite itself losing 2%. </p> <p>Less welcome results came in the publisher's Home and Lifestyle Group, where its former Gruner &amp; Jahr titles were hit by the distribution dispute which has caused their absence from the shelves of Tesco: Best fell by 9%, Prima by 6%. And still haemorrhaging readers with an unstaunchability suggesting haemophilia is Esquire, doggedly pursuing its \"keep your tits in for the lads\" policy of eschewing the pin-ups used by other men's mags as reader bait. </p> <p>With the babe-free monthly plummeting 40% to 61,271, NatMags' gloss that Esquire is \"creating a totally new men's market where others are now beginning to follow\" should win every PR award going in the \"innova tion in spinning pants\" category. And it drew from editor Peter Howarth's old foe James Brown - whose film title Hotdog posted a \"very respectable\" debut ABC of 39,247 - the comment that \"if Howarth was the captain of the Titanic, he'd be saying 'We may be drowning, but look at the fantastic views of underwater life'\". </p> <p>You will naturally want to know whether OK! beat Hello! in the gripping and increasingly bitter contest in which the two celebrity titles vie for supremacy, with OK! on top this time last year but Hello! regaining the lead six months ago. And the answer is some much-needed good news for Northern &amp; Shell boss Richard Desmond. </p> <p>A period in which Desmond acquired the cross-promotional muscle of the Express titles and spent \u00a31m on photos of the Michael Douglas/Catherine Zeta-Jones wedding - triggering a feral courtroom battle over Hello!'s spoiler snaps - saw his OK! boost its circulation by 6.20% to 586,176. With Hello! up only 1.50%, new editor Phil Hall now has an 84,000 deficit to make up. </p> <p><strong> How the mags compare</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Men's Lifestyle</strong> </p> <p>FHM: 716,679 <br> Loaded: 351,353 <br> Maxim: 328,463 <br> Men's Health: 235,851 <br> Front: 150,693 <br></p> <p><strong> Women's Lifestyle/Fashion</strong> </p> <p>Cosmopolitan: 460,086 <br> Good Housekeeping: 404,476 <br> Marie Claire: 400,543 <br> Prima: 395,164 <br> New Woman: 281,828 </p> <p><strong> Celebrity Weeklies</strong> </p> <p>OK!

A few titles are up, but the vast majority are down - from market leader Sugar's 1.90% year-on-year loss to Live &amp; Kicking's horrendous 29.80% drop, largely attributable to the decline in the Saturday morning show it's linked to. Reasons for the slump are not hard to find: the pop scene is dull, with clone boy bands giving way to clones of clones of clones, and there's a limit to the number of Steps or Britney covers any girl will splash out on; but above all teenagers and tweenagers are spending an increasing amount of time online, finding the kind of celebrity gossip, features and personal experience pieces that mags can provide, alongside the chat rooms and opportunities to meet boys they can't. The number of defectors to the net is bound to increase, and common sense would suggest this is a sector to steer clear of if you're planning a new launch. Yet last year the BBC brought out the teen title Star, the recent debut of Mad About Boys created as big a sensation as the first girl in the playground with a bra, and CosmoGirl! and Elle Girl are both due to arrive this year. Bonkers or what? Seemingly equally demented are publishers eager to add even more titles to the women's monthly sector, described as \"mature\" and \"congested\" for about as long as anyone can remember. For the umpteenth period in succession, sales are generally down, with good results for Company and Elle the only significant exceptions; otherwise publishers are reduced to hailing zero change as success \"in a very competitive market\" and tiny gains as triumphs. The \"Full up\" sign is there for all to see, you'd imagine. Nevertheless, the BBC's Eve and IPC's resuscitated Nova wedged themselves into the crush during 2000, Time Warner premiered In Style last week, and Cond\u00e9 Nast's Glamour will shortly follow. Nurse! And yet. And yet. The possible method in their madness can be discerned if you look at the women's weekly sector, where stale old-style mags with titles beginning with the word 'Woman' have been in decline since at least the 1980s, as elderly readers - wondering on foul wintry mornings whether they feel up to tottering to the newsagent for their copy of Woman's Own - vote with their Zimmer frames. Publishers could easily have looked at the relentlessly dropping ABC figures and stayed well away from the sector. They didn't, though. They saw opportunities. First came the German invasion led by Take a Break and Bella, then magazines such as Now (up 20% in the latest figures) combined tabloid stories with better pictures. Above all, the success of Hello! and OK! revitalised the whole sector, and their impact has spread well beyond it. Without their demonstration of an endless public appetite for celebs, it's hard to imagine publishers nerving themselves to launch such titles as Star, In Style and Heat, all centred on the lifestyles of the rich and famous. Up by a flabbergasting 137.60%, Heat (see box opposite) was far and away the stand-out performer in the July-Dec 2000 ABCs, and its owner Emap had other reasons to be cheerful. FHM, which once looked to have peaked, put on 2% and at 716,679 retains its place in the top 10 of all titles ranked by the number of copies \"actively purchased\" (ie not the result of club membership, etc). Elle added 6.80%, almost identical to its year-on-year gain in the previous period, and It's Bliss, up 4.30%, was one of the few teen titles to post gains. But Smash Hits, down 8.20%, fell victim to the slump in pop-based titles, and of the sinking Wagadon titles acquired by Emap, only the Face (up 8.20%) has recovered. Death Row surely beckons for Arena (down 21.30 to a meagre 37,080); and it's surprising that the publisher which last year deleted Select and Minx has not already put Sky (down 35.20%) out of its misery. Also sliding are the once-healthy women's title Red (down 14%) and teen mag J-17 (13%), suffering double-digit decline for the second consecutive period. IPC had a bit of a stinker, hit by demoralising losses in such prestige titles as Marie Claire (down 11%) and Loaded (5.40%), with further whopping drops at men's mag Later (22.40%) and women's glossies Woman's Journal (14.80%), Essentials (10.50%) and Woman and Home (8.70%). Attempts to reboot NME have so far been in vain, and if it continues to lose 8.20% of its readership every six months it could be heading for the same rock graveyard as its former stablemate Melody Maker. Nova debuted with 75,142, said to be \"on target with launch expectations\". Besides Now's performance, IPC could take some consolation from TV and Satellite Week (up 22.40%) and What's On TV's loss of only 2.30% - far from contemptible in a volatile listings sector recently reinforced by Bauer's 732,259-selling TV Choice - which preserves its position as the No 1 actively purchased title with a monstrous ABC of 1,701,064. But this goodish news was offset by grim figures from TV Times, which shed 12.90% of its circulation. Its longstanding rival Radio Times (down 5.40%) also drooped, scarcely improving the glum mood at BBC Worldwide. The Beeb's magazines were the worst hit by girls getting bored by pop, with Top of the Pops chasing Live and Kicking downwards in losing 17.20%. Cond\u00e9 Nast experienced mixed fortunes, achieving significant rises at Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller (19.70%) and Vanity Fair (8%), but falls at Tatler (3.60%) and GQ (1.40%). As did National Magazines, where the outstanding result was Company's 8% gain, strikingly reversing the previous period's 4.80% year-on-year loss. The slippage at Marie Claire meant that NatMags' Cosmopolitan was able to extend its lead at the head of the sector despite itself losing 2%. Less welcome results came in the publisher's Home and Lifestyle Group, where its former Gruner &amp; Jahr titles were hit by the distribution dispute which has caused their absence from the shelves of Tesco: Best fell by 9%, Prima by 6%. And still haemorrhaging readers with an unstaunchability suggesting haemophilia is Esquire, doggedly pursuing its \"keep your tits in for the lads\" policy of eschewing the pin-ups used by other men's mags as reader bait. With the babe-free monthly plummeting 40% to 61,271, NatMags' gloss that Esquire is \"creating a totally new men's market where others are now beginning to follow\" should win every PR award going in the \"innova tion in spinning pants\" category. And it drew from editor Peter Howarth's old foe James Brown - whose film title Hotdog posted a \"very respectable\" debut ABC of 39,247 - the comment that \"if Howarth was the captain of the Titanic, he'd be saying 'We may be drowning, but look at the fantastic views of underwater life'\". You will naturally want to know whether OK! beat Hello! in the gripping and increasingly bitter contest in which the two celebrity titles vie for supremacy, with OK! on top this time last year but Hello! regaining the lead six months ago. And the answer is some much-needed good news for Northern &amp; Shell boss Richard Desmond. A period in which Desmond acquired the cross-promotional muscle of the Express titles and spent \u00a31m on photos of the Michael Douglas/Catherine Zeta-Jones wedding - triggering a feral courtroom battle over Hello!'s spoiler snaps - saw his OK! boost its circulation by 6.20% to 586,176. With Hello! up only 1.50%, new editor Phil Hall now has an 84,000 deficit to make up.

      "body": "<p>Given his girth, Andrew Neil has a remarkable ability to pat himself on the back. He was at it again earlier this month at the Dorchester on London's Park Lane, at a party to celebrate the circulation of the Scotsman bursting through 100,000 for the first time. </p> <p>There was an air of bewilderment around the room, filled with senior staff from across the Press Holdings newspaper group where Neil carries the title of publisher-in-chief - a newspaper business owned by the Monaco-based Barclay family, which spans Sunday Business and Scotland on Sunday, as well as the Scotsman. This bewilderment had little to do with the extraordinary fact that Neil was celebrating the Scotsman's supposed success in a fussy, expensive London hotel - several hundred miles from the grittily competitive world of Scottish publishing. </p> <p>It was concern over what Neil was actually saying which was causing a stir. Last year's relaunch of the Scotsman, accompanied by a slashing of its cover price and forced through despite a dramatic exodus of staff, had been an unqualified success, the publisher declared. Neil had rescued the Scotsman. And now that his job north of the border was done, the former Sunday Times editor was promising to devote \"100%\" of his time to Sunday Business. </p> <p>This young newspaper, acquired by the Barclays three years earlier and relaunched by Neil's one-time News International colleague, Jeff Randall, had been an unqualified editorial success, Neil observed. Now it was his duty to turn it into a commercial success. In the past 12 months, sales of Sunday Business have fallen alarmingly by 33% to just 37,600 excluding bulks. </p> <p>Nils Pratley, who succeeds Randall this week, is young and exceptionally well-versed in the black arts of City journalism, yet his colleagues doubt he has the stature or experience to stand up to the ebullient and over-bearing Neil. </p> <p>On one side of the Dorchester room, a few Scotsman stalwarts were suppressing their titters. But across the room, the gloom was descending on the Sunday Business contingent. \"It was napkin-biting stuff,\" recalls one of Neil's guests. \"Here was a man who, having already poleaxed the paper's circulation, was now promising to ride to the rescue.\" </p> <p>\"When Andrew Neil starts saying this is the year of Sunday Business, then you start to worry. I don't envy Nils,\" added another. </p> <p>Being financial journalists, those working on Sunday Business claim an ability to add up. They were also well aware that in his relatively short career as a businessman, Neil has only ever been associated with numbers which are big and red. </p> <p>From time to time, at the Scotsman's office in Edinburgh and the London headquarters on High Holborn, Neil's senior editors sit back, tot up the money their publisher has lost their proprietor (Aidan Barclay, son of the reclusive Barclay twins) and quietly wonder just how Neil has managed to retain his job. </p> <p>Getting an exact take on the losses run up by the Barclays in their bid to establish a newspaper empire is not easy. For a start, the umbrella newspaper company, Press Holdings, is based off-shore in Jersey and consolidated accounts are not public. But it is possible to burrow down through the individual publishing subsidiaries registered in Britain, an exercise which paints a financial picture of a potentially unstable group which is almost entirely reliant on cash injections and loans from the Barclays and their bankers. </p> <p>The most eye-watering figures which come to light are those associated with the European, the Maxwell venture which the Barclays rescued in 1992 and where Neil took over stewardship in 1997 before eventually closing the publication down in late 1999 - despite promises of funding for at least five years. The Barclays pumped \u00a374m into this particular piece of vanity hackery, which built up cumulative losses of \u00a379m. </p> <p>The Scotsman, purchased for \u00a385m by the Barclays in 1995, has always looked a more healthy business proposition. With a reasonable history of profitability - by newspaper standards - the brothers had to loan the business only \u00a34.3m by the end of 1999. But already profitability was slipping - from \u00a36.9m to \u00a35.8m that year at the Scotsman group. </p> <p>Neil became publisher on July 1 1999 and from being a disengaged editor-in-chief he adopted a very hands-on role - taking a punishing attitude to costs, to show he had the ability to successfully manage a business. Budgets were slashed across the board. </p> <p>Most importantly, promotional spend was curbed as was the print run. By the end of his first year, profitability at the papers was improving and Neil had proved his point - he had made the company commercially robust. The effect of the short term gain, however, was to destabilise the titles to the point where the sales had slumped to 72,000 and he was forced to cut the cover price to get the title back on its feet. That, as Neil himself points out, has cost the company up to \u00a35m. </p> <p>\"No one really knows or asks hard questions about the finances. They only look at the circulation figures where he can happily, with the Scotsman, say that it is successful. But what does it cost to get there? Other people's money doesn't factor into it. He simply craves the attention and the accolades of his peers. He is financially illiterate in many ways,\" says one former executive. </p> <p>Then there is Sunday Business Publishing, whose last filed accounts (for 1999) show accumulated losses of \u00a319m. Including an associate company, Sunday Business Printing, filed accounts suggest that until 14 months ago, the Barclays had already pumped almost \u00a326m into the paper. </p> <p>Sunday Business is still haemorrhaging cash. Three years ago when Randall, armed with a serious chequebook, threw together a team of 36 financial journalists to re-invent a newspaper which had previously been treated with derision in the City, \"break even\" was projected to be reached when circulation hit 80,000. This figure was attained for one month, early last year, when a growing base of regular business readers was suddenly swelled by the excitement surrounding the short-lived dot.com boom. </p> <p>This was fantastic news for Randall. It was widely believed that when Neil had hired Randall, the former Sunday Times city editor had been promised a \u00a31m bonus if he could make the paper profitable within the three years. </p> <p>But the euphoria was short-lived. Bizarrely, Neil, while wrapped up in the editorial antics at the Scotsman and busy slashing the cover price of his flagship publication north of the border, suddenly decided that the moment had arrived to double the cover price of Sunday Business. Aghast at the timing of the move, Randall and his team begged for an immediate round of marketing/advertising to support sales as the price of the paper jumped from 50p to \u00a31. </p> <p>Neil refused. Instead, he began to dismantle the countrywide distribution system painfully constructed over the previous two years and abandoned plans to print Sunday Business on the Scotsman's presses, so depriving the paper of a chance of targeting the important Scottish business community. As sales fell, the print run was slashed from 130,000 to 80,000. </p> <p>With only a limited base of subscription sales, circulation collapsed as the paper disappeared from news-stands outside London and the south east. The latest figures, for January this year, show full-rate sales of just 37,600, topped up with 16,000 bulk sales, sold to hotels for a nominal sum. </p> <p>Given that recent experience, the Sunday Business editorial team had little reason to feel any confidence in Neil's promise, delivered at the Dorchester, to pull them out of the mire. He had, after all, thrown them into trouble in the first place. </p> <p>\"Take a look at the strategic decision to double the price of Sunday Business - the sales fall through the floor,\" says one former Press Holdings executive. \"And this is at the same time that he is more than halving the Scotsman cover price to get a 25% lift. But he doesn't think like that. There is no five-year plan in place, he is always thinking of how what he does will play in London to his peers.\" </p> <p>Taking the established figures from the newspaper operations, and then guesstimating the as-yet unquantified losses from a string of aborted internet ventures which Neil had backed enthusiastically (mainly through a company called the Net Media Group, which has yet to file accounts with Companies House), senior figures at the group reckon the Barclays are so far wearing losses of about \u00a3120m racked up during Neil's tenure. </p> <p>The Barclays, of course, can afford this sort of pain, having built a fortune in commercial property during the 1970s and 1980s. The family are traditionally long-term \"value investors\" - buying assets which are out of fashion, financing them through the hard times and then selling when they return to vogue. Their patience with their cash-consuming newspaper business fits with this financial model. </p> <p>Press Holdings' newspaper assets clearly carry a certain value. The Scotsman and Scotland on Sunday, purchased for \u00a385m six years ago, were together valued at \u00a3135m in 1998 by the directors, and then revalued at \u00a3170m a year later. But in doing so the directors were attributing a higher rating to the business than that currently placed on the Daily Mail group by the stock market. Neil says the Scotsman group is now worth more than \u00a3200m. </p> <p>Putting a valuation on Sunday Business is more difficult, since the business has yet to prove itself as a viable commercial entity - some insiders suggest \u00a350m. The Barclays are believed to have had approaches from both News International and Pearson, the publisher of the Financial Times.

      "bodyText": "Given his girth, Andrew Neil has a remarkable ability to pat himself on the back. He was at it again earlier this month at the Dorchester on London's Park Lane, at a party to celebrate the circulation of the Scotsman bursting through 100,000 for the first time. There was an air of bewilderment around the room, filled with senior staff from across the Press Holdings newspaper group where Neil carries the title of publisher-in-chief - a newspaper business owned by the Monaco-based Barclay family, which spans Sunday Business and Scotland on Sunday, as well as the Scotsman. This bewilderment had little to do with the extraordinary fact that Neil was celebrating the Scotsman's supposed success in a fussy, expensive London hotel - several hundred miles from the grittily competitive world of Scottish publishing. It was concern over what Neil was actually saying which was causing a stir. Last year's relaunch of the Scotsman, accompanied by a slashing of its cover price and forced through despite a dramatic exodus of staff, had been an unqualified success, the publisher declared. Neil had rescued the Scotsman. And now that his job north of the border was done, the former Sunday Times editor was promising to devote \"100%\" of his time to Sunday Business. This young newspaper, acquired by the Barclays three years earlier and relaunched by Neil's one-time News International colleague, Jeff Randall, had been an unqualified editorial success, Neil observed. Now it was his duty to turn it into a commercial success. In the past 12 months, sales of Sunday Business have fallen alarmingly by 33% to just 37,600 excluding bulks. Nils Pratley, who succeeds Randall this week, is young and exceptionally well-versed in the black arts of City journalism, yet his colleagues doubt he has the stature or experience to stand up to the ebullient and over-bearing Neil. On one side of the Dorchester room, a few Scotsman stalwarts were suppressing their titters. But across the room, the gloom was descending on the Sunday Business contingent. \"It was napkin-biting stuff,\" recalls one of Neil's guests. \"Here was a man who, having already poleaxed the paper's circulation, was now promising to ride to the rescue.\" \"When Andrew Neil starts saying this is the year of Sunday Business, then you start to worry. I don't envy Nils,\" added another. Being financial journalists, those working on Sunday Business claim an ability to add up. They were also well aware that in his relatively short career as a businessman, Neil has only ever been associated with numbers which are big and red. From time to time, at the Scotsman's office in Edinburgh and the London headquarters on High Holborn, Neil's senior editors sit back, tot up the money their publisher has lost their proprietor (Aidan Barclay, son of the reclusive Barclay twins) and quietly wonder just how Neil has managed to retain his job. Getting an exact take on the losses run up by the Barclays in their bid to establish a newspaper empire is not easy. For a start, the umbrella newspaper company, Press Holdings, is based off-shore in Jersey and consolidated accounts are not public. But it is possible to burrow down through the individual publishing subsidiaries registered in Britain, an exercise which paints a financial picture of a potentially unstable group which is almost entirely reliant on cash injections and loans from the Barclays and their bankers. The most eye-watering figures which come to light are those associated with the European, the Maxwell venture which the Barclays rescued in 1992 and where Neil took over stewardship in 1997 before eventually closing the publication down in late 1999 - despite promises of funding for at least five years. The Barclays pumped \u00a374m into this particular piece of vanity hackery, which built up cumulative losses of \u00a379m. The Scotsman, purchased for \u00a385m by the Barclays in 1995, has always looked a more healthy business proposition. With a reasonable history of profitability - by newspaper standards - the brothers had to loan the business only \u00a34.3m by the end of 1999. But already profitability was slipping - from \u00a36.9m to \u00a35.8m that year at the Scotsman group. Neil became publisher on July 1 1999 and from being a disengaged editor-in-chief he adopted a very hands-on role - taking a punishing attitude to costs, to show he had the ability to successfully manage a business. Budgets were slashed across the board. Most importantly, promotional spend was curbed as was the print run. By the end of his first year, profitability at the papers was improving and Neil had proved his point - he had made the company commercially robust. The effect of the short term gain, however, was to destabilise the titles to the point where the sales had slumped to 72,000 and he was forced to cut the cover price to get the title back on its feet. That, as Neil himself points out, has cost the company up to \u00a35m. \"No one really knows or asks hard questions about the finances. They only look at the circulation figures where he can happily, with the Scotsman, say that it is successful. But what does it cost to get there? Other people's money doesn't factor into it. He simply craves the attention and the accolades of his peers. He is financially illiterate in many ways,\" says one former executive. Then there is Sunday Business Publishing, whose last filed accounts (for 1999) show accumulated losses of \u00a319m. Including an associate company, Sunday Business Printing, filed accounts suggest that until 14 months ago, the Barclays had already pumped almost \u00a326m into the paper. Sunday Business is still haemorrhaging cash. Three years ago when Randall, armed with a serious chequebook, threw together a team of 36 financial journalists to re-invent a newspaper which had previously been treated with derision in the City, \"break even\" was projected to be reached when circulation hit 80,000. This figure was attained for one month, early last year, when a growing base of regular business readers was suddenly swelled by the excitement surrounding the short-lived dot.com boom. This was fantastic news for Randall. It was widely believed that when Neil had hired Randall, the former Sunday Times city editor had been promised a \u00a31m bonus if he could make the paper profitable within the three years. But the euphoria was short-lived. Bizarrely, Neil, while wrapped up in the editorial antics at the Scotsman and busy slashing the cover price of his flagship publication north of the border, suddenly decided that the moment had arrived to double the cover price of Sunday Business. Aghast at the timing of the move, Randall and his team begged for an immediate round of marketing/advertising to support sales as the price of the paper jumped from 50p to \u00a31. Neil refused. Instead, he began to dismantle the countrywide distribution system painfully constructed over the previous two years and abandoned plans to print Sunday Business on the Scotsman's presses, so depriving the paper of a chance of targeting the important Scottish business community. As sales fell, the print run was slashed from 130,000 to 80,000. With only a limited base of subscription sales, circulation collapsed as the paper disappeared from news-stands outside London and the south east. The latest figures, for January this year, show full-rate sales of just 37,600, topped up with 16,000 bulk sales, sold to hotels for a nominal sum. Given that recent experience, the Sunday Business editorial team had little reason to feel any confidence in Neil's promise, delivered at the Dorchester, to pull them out of the mire. He had, after all, thrown them into trouble in the first place. \"Take a look at the strategic decision to double the price of Sunday Business - the sales fall through the floor,\" says one former Press Holdings executive. \"And this is at the same time that he is more than halving the Scotsman cover price to get a 25% lift. But he doesn't think like that. There is no five-year plan in place, he is always thinking of how what he does will play in London to his peers.\" Taking the established figures from the newspaper operations, and then guesstimating the as-yet unquantified losses from a string of aborted internet ventures which Neil had backed enthusiastically (mainly through a company called the Net Media Group, which has yet to file accounts with Companies House), senior figures at the group reckon the Barclays are so far wearing losses of about \u00a3120m racked up during Neil's tenure. The Barclays, of course, can afford this sort of pain, having built a fortune in commercial property during the 1970s and 1980s. The family are traditionally long-term \"value investors\" - buying assets which are out of fashion, financing them through the hard times and then selling when they return to vogue. Their patience with their cash-consuming newspaper business fits with this financial model. Press Holdings' newspaper assets clearly carry a certain value. The Scotsman and Scotland on Sunday, purchased for \u00a385m six years ago, were together valued at \u00a3135m in 1998 by the directors, and then revalued at \u00a3170m a year later. But in doing so the directors were attributing a higher rating to the business than that currently placed on the Daily Mail group by the stock market. Neil says the Scotsman group is now worth more than \u00a3200m. Putting a valuation on Sunday Business is more difficult, since the business has yet to prove itself as a viable commercial entity - some insiders suggest \u00a350m. The Barclays are believed to have had approaches from both News International and Pearson, the publisher of the Financial Times. But any potential buyer will have been aware that the newspaper still required sustained investment. Any valuation discussed in the past will have been dramatically higher when circulation was above 80,000, than now, when the core readership has dwindled to little more than 30,000. Throwing heavy money at a business whose revenues are falling fast requires real bravery and there are doubts over whether Aidan Barclay, to whom Neil reports, still has the stomach to deal with the losses his newspapers keep hitting him with. Something of a relaunch is planned at Sunday Business next month, with a colour magazine being introduced. Rather than cranking up investment, cost-cutting on the editorial side at Sunday Business is expected in the short term - with Neil replicating his actions at the Scotsman. At the same time, there has to be an assumption that Neil will avoid the editorial approach he adopted first at the European and then the Scotsman - adopting a broadly anti-European line with the former and loudly opposing Scottish devolution while running the latter. An anti-City stance by Sunday Business would, of course, put the paper out of business. As for Neil's future as an effective chief executive, the jury is still out. He would only say on Friday: \"We have a strong newspaper group here which is going forward.\" \"He must know that if this was a normal quoted company, shareholders would be baying for his blood,\" says one of his lieutenants. \"Aidan, on the other hand, is prone to long periods of managerial neglect, punctuated by tantrums. Andrew, in truth, could go at any moment. But given the Barclays' pride and the depth of their pockets, just stating as much will probably extend his stewardship here.\" Full disclosure by Guy Adams Andrew Neil was educated at his local Paisley Grammar School and Glasgow University.

If there is confusion, British travellers on the continent will surely be as confused as anybody.</p> <p>In Britain itself, the euro has come down to earth. When Tony Blair announced in parliament that he would decide whether to put the euro to referendum in the first two years of the next parliament, he was telling no secrets. It was a statement of intent that ensures that the euro can now be processed through the political operations of this country, like regional devolution or school reform. With a general election expected in May, the euro will be one of the main issues of substance before the electorate.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the European reprimand to Ireland last week revealed, for the first time, the vast political scope of the single currency. European finance ministers (including, I regret to say, the British) told the Irish government that it should not cut taxes and raise spending in its 2001 budget because that might lead to inflation and destabilise the euro.</p> <p>Economic and monetary union since the Maastricht treaty in 1992 has been a story of coercion, threat and pointless bustle, but to tell the most successful economy in the union how to conduct its budgetary business is overdoing it. In its transition from an agricultural to a commercial economy, Ireland was bound to generate inflation. The continental economies should welcome a little inflation in Ireland to dull that sharp Irish competitive edge. The Irish economy is still far too small to have any influence on the external value of the euro.</p> <p>Modern economies are hundred-billion-dollar engines fuelled by money. To manipulate them, governments can only increase or decrease the supply of money. They can raise or drop the cost of money through the rate of interest or take money from people through taxes or return it to them through rebates.</p> <p>In 1999, the Irish government abandoned for all time its monetary sovereignty to the European central bank but still thought it could tax and spend as it pleased. Last week's events suggest that the proponents of European federation in Germany and the Benelux countries may get what they always wanted: the euro will slowly reduce national governments, at least in their economic activities, to ciphers.</p> <p>For the first two years of its existence, the euro had no friends on the foreign exchange markets. Its supporters in Britain were consigned to a sulky silence. It is hard to promote a currency in the throes of falling 30% against the US dollar.</p> <p>At the end of last year, the dollar began to drop and the euro to rise in response to steady economic growth in Europe and alarming signs of a slump in the US. As of last week, it was a suckers' rally. For the moment, the US is off the critical list. Bulls of the euro have lost so much money that they are very reluctant to accept the European economic story. The decision by the European central bank on Thursday not to follow the Anglo-Saxon central banks - the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England - into taking down market rates of interest was the last straw. The euro fell another 3% last week. It is even falling against the yen, the currency of the world's most troubled major economy.</p> <p>The euro debate is beset by historical irony. Sterling, which has been on the slide since the early 1930s and on the skids since the early 1970s, is now back in business. The markets for long-term capital believe that inflation will be lower in the UK over the next 30 years than in euroland. (A loan to a borrower in sterling offers lower interest than the equivalent loan in Deutschmarks, but compensates the creditor by the greater apparent solidity of the principal.)</p> <p>For the generation now on the threshold of middle age, who watched in agony while postwar Labour and Tory governments demolished sterling, the present stability of the pound is near miraculous. Eight and a half years of economic prosperity and currency stability is a short time in the life of a long-lived commercial nation such as Britain, but it is a good chunk of a lifetime. It has taken half a century to restore the prestige of sterling - just in time, it seems, to see it abolished.</p> <p>For all Labour governments but that of Tony Blair, sterling has been a disaster. Ramsay MacDonald in 1931, Clement Attlee in 1947, Harold Wilson in 1967, James Callaghan in 1976: each presided over a sterling crisis. It was no wonder that the Labour party despaired of the damn thing.</p> <p>On coming to power in 1997, Labour seemed to be saying: since we can't manage sterling, let's abolish it or give it to the Europeans to run. Instead, Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the Exchequer, gave the management of sterling to the Bank of England. It is hard to imagine Mr Brown saying at referendum time two years from now, \"I made a mistake - Labour can't manage the UK economy and currency, nor can the Tories. We must let the continentals do it.\"</p> <p>The chief complaint is that sterling is too strong against the euro. Yet a strong currency, as the Germans found from 1948 until they gave up the Deutschmark for the euro, is a powerful business discipline. As an official of the old German Bundesbank said to me in Frankfurt in 1990: \"You British should try a strong currency - it's not as bad as it sounds.\"</p> <p>For all the strength of the currency in which it prices its exports, the UK still managed to run a small surplus in its trade with euroland in the third quarter of last year (the last for which figures have been published). There may be something in the theory that currency depreciation was just a bolthole for unsuccessful managers.</p> <p>In Britain, there are supporters of the single currency, but there are no enthusiasts. There are none of those shining young people you meet at the annual congresses of the German political parties, who tell you that the euro is a scheme of federation and will be good not just for Europe but for humanity in general.</p> <p>Instead, the arguments for joining the euro have become tedious by repetition. By eliminating movements in individual currencies, a single currency lifts some of the fog from doing business so that goods and services should become cheaper and better. Creditors face no risk of their loans translating into less of their home currency, so rates of interest can fall, and thus the rate of profit to pay the interest. Investors are emboldened and employ more people, who will pay more taxes and receive less in benefits, so public finances improve.</p> <p>At the end of the rainbow, the conversion of the European Union into a true common market will ensure that the power and wealth of individual states, at present dissipated, can combine into an entity more powerful than the US.</p> <p>The political version of those arguments is Mr Brown's five tests of British suitability.

      "bodyText": "Sportswear company Reebok is looking at extending its brand by developing a range of drinks. Reebok International has signed a licensing deal with the Clearly Canadian Beverage Corporation to produce an \"innovative\" branded drink for the US, Canada and Caribbean markets. The agreement lasts for nine years but CCBC would not give details of either the type of drink or the launch timescale. The initiative fits in with Reebok's determination to capitalise on its reputation for quality sportswear by venturing into new business areas. Last November it emerged the company was planning an assault on the European health and fitness club market and was looking at sites in Canary Wharf, London and other European capitals. Reebok may well be planning to use its sports pedigree to target the fast-growing sports drink market dominated by brands such as Gatorade and Lucozade. However, it is unlikely to launch a beer considering its TV advertising, which has highlighted the problems of giant beer bellies. Rival sportswear firm Adidas has stretched its brand by launching a range of male grooming products. Meanwhile Nike has set its stall on retail, opening a chain of the giant Nike Town outlets.",

The vicious briefing against Peter Mandelson - which kept the Hinduja affair on the boil when it should have been cooled down - was a major misjudgment.

Was \"bog standard\" a phrase which suddenly came to mind, or was it carefully constructed to accommodate the lowest common denominator of politics? It certainly encouraged the Sun to support Labour's new education policy. But it also alienated several hundred thousand teachers who heroically work in the schools at which they believe the metaphor was directed.

      "bodyText": "The government's insistence that the US and British air strikes against Iraq are justified under international law is less firmly endorsed in Whitehall than ministers admit publicly, informed sources said last night. Private doubts about the legal basis of the no-fly zones over Iraq resurfaced as angry Labour MPs, MEPs and union leaders gave Tony Blair clear signals that they will be much more sceptical about intimate military cooperation with Washington now that a Republican administration is back in power - even though a general election is just weeks away. In public Mr Blair and his senior colleagues argue that the threat to the west from \"rogue states\" like Iraq is real and leave Britain and the US \"perfectly entitled to deter aggression\" as the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, put it. Under the Tories, successive legal advisers, including Lord Williams of Mostyn, the attorney-general, have reassured ministers that the zones are sanctioned by international law. However authoritative sources said last night: \"They are less confident in private\". Labour's rank and file is also more sceptical. Bill Morris, leader of the TGWU union, and Glenys Kinnock MEP expressed doubts about Friday night's bombings and the 10-year policy of sanctions which have failed to bring Saddam Hussein to heel. George Galloway, the arabist Labour MP, flew to Baghdad and likened Friday's attack to \"Hitler marching into Czechoslovakia\" in 1939. \"What the British and American governments are doing is reckless, lawless and murderous. If they are not already working for Saddam Hussein then they might as well be because for every bomb that is dropped, Saddam is getting stronger,\" the Glasgow Kelvin MP said. More than 2,000 people - including Iraq's deputy foreign minister, Nabil Najim - protested against the bombings in Baghdad and at least 1,000 other protesters gathered near the offices of the ruling al-Ba'ath party. \"This dangerous aggression shows how much the Americans and Britons hate Iraqis and do not respect any international law,\" Mr Najim told the demonstrators. \"This aggression must be condemned.\" Only a handful of countries have joined that condemnation, said the foreign secretary, Robin Cook. Mr Blair and Mr Cook led a platoon of ministers in defending the US-UK action as necessary to protect their air sorties from anti-aircraft attack by Saddam's forces - and thereby to save the Kurds of northern Iraq and the southern Shi'ites from his murderous revenge. That is the legal basis which ministers invoke when challenged: the right under international law to intervene to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe like the use of chemical weapons to kill 5,000 Kurdish villagers in the 1980s when the west still tilted towards Saddam in his war with Iran. It was also the legal basis used to justify the 1999 Kosovo intervention. But, the no-fly zones are not specifically sanctioned by any UN security council resolution. Four days before Mr Blair flies into Washington to meet President, George Bush, it emerged that Friday air strikes were cleared by both leaders after requests from military commanders, the RAF as much as the USAF. They were increasingly worried about threats to their aircraft posed by new Iraqi radar and missile systems, defence sources explained. Their requests were passed up the chain of command and were focused on Iraq's new integrated air defence system, including a growing number of SA-6 surface-to-air missiles supplied, according to intelligence sources, by Serbia and Ukraine.",

Two leading British barristers will battle it out in the courtroom in the capital, Suva, where the security forces are preparing for potential civil unrest when the court gives its ruling. Nicholas Blake QC, a member of the recently formed Matrix Chambers in London, will represent the interim regime of Laisenia Qarase, put in power by the military and indigenous chiefs after the coup last May.

One observer said the outcome would have \"long-term and far-reaching signal effects, in the South Pacific and beyond, for government respect for the rule of law, human rights and the independence of the judiciary\". Some human rights activists in Britain have criticised the Matrix Chambers, in which Cherie Booth QC is a partner, for taking on a case which sets Fiji's unelected and racially biased interim regime against a poor sugar farmer. The appeal has been described by Amnesty International as rattling the fundamentals of human rights, being a struggle between the rule of law and rule by force. The Matrix Chambers described itself as one of the top human rights practices when it was formed last year. Its fee from the Fijian government for the task of challenging last year's decision upholding the multiracial constitution is estimated to be \u00a3100,000. An Amnesty International spokesman said: \"The fundamental principles of human rights and democracy will be on trial and this will be a landmark human rights case. \"Amnesty is concerned about the safety of Chandrika Prasad and hundreds of other Indo-Fijians, because of recent threats by coup supporters, should the administration's appeal be rejected by the courts.\" The previous constitution was torn up after Mr Speight, a disgruntled Fijian business man, staged his coup on May 19 last year. He and his gang stormed the parliament building in Suva and took hostage dozens of MPs - including Fiji's first ethnic Indian prime minister, Mahendra Chaudhry, and his cabinet. Campaigning to make indigenous Fijians paramount, he and his henchmen demanded the scrapping of the multiracial constitution and the dismissal of the democratically elected Mr Chaudhry The army agreed, temporarily took control, and put the interim administration in place. The Indian Fijians, whose forebears were brought to the islands by British colonialists more than a century ago, make up 44% of the population, although 67,000 fled overseas after two coups in 1987. Indigenous Fijians make up 51%. After the coup, the divisions between the ethnic groups worsened. Chandrika Prasad's family suffered a series of racist attacks and threats. His home was looted by coup rebels and their sympathisers.

The protest comes as a leaked document outlines US-backed plans for shipping spent nuclear fuel from eight Taiwanese reactors to Russia for disposal. The lower house of parliament, the duma, is due to debate the second reading of a bill to end Russia's long-standing ban on the importation of nuclear waste. Minatom, the state nuclear company sponsoring the bill, believes it can earn \u00a315bn by importing waste from overseas. The advanced stage of the plans became apparent at the weekend when a US energy department document was leaked to the anti-nuclear organisation Ecodefence in Moscow. The report, \"Foreign Spent Fuel Storage and Geologic Disposal in Russia\", produced by the department and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, outlines the plan for shipping Taiwanese nuclear waste to Russia. The US involvement in the scheme stems from the control Washington exercises over nuclear proliferation. Spent fuel can be reprocessed and used for nuclear weapons, so, from the building of the first reactors in Taiwan, the US has insisted on controlling the disposal route for the nuclear waste if any of the material originated in America, as much of it does. This has proved an embarrassment to Washington, since until now no country has been willing to take another's spent nuclear fuel, least of all America.

      "bodyText": "The government last night sought to reassure users of the new anti-smoking drug Zyban after it emerged that 18 Britons had died after taking it. The deaths, among more than 270,000 people prescribed the drug, have all occurred over the eight months since the nicotine addiction treatment was launched in June last year. The Department of Health is also believed to have received notice from GPs of 3,450 other patients suffering possible side-effects, including insomnia, chest pains, dry mouth, rashes, nausea and depression. Officials said there would be continued close monitoring of Zyban's safety record, as already required through the reporting of suspected adverse reactions to new treatments, but gave no indication that extra measures were needed. The manufacturers, GlaxoSmithKline, also insisted there was no indication the drug was unsafe and it could play a big part in reducing the 120,000-a-year death rates from smoking-related diseases in Britain. Zyban seeks to regulate chemicals in the brain thought to be linked to nicotine addiction and its makers last night said that its main ingredient bupropion) was used in 5m anti-smoking treatments worldwide. It was also used in a different formula by 10m people, though not in Britain, as an antidepressant. Advice by the government's medical controls agency (MCA) to doctors warns them not to prescribe it to patients with a record of seizures or epileptic fits, where there is thought to be a risk affecting one in every 1,000 patients. It says the contribution of Zyban to any deaths is unproven and suspected reactions \"are not necessarily caused by the drug and may relate to other factors such as nicotine withdrawal, other illnesses or other medicines taken concurrently\". The health department added yesterday: \"It should be noted that patients may be required to stop smoking because of underlying diseases and these may well explain some of the reported deaths of patients taking Zyban.\" Any widely prescribed drug would have a high number of reports from GPs about suspect reactions. The Mail on Sunday yesterday reported that among the 18 who had died, four had heart attacks, two committed suicide, four died from brain disorders and one had acute asthma. A coroner in Sunderland last week referred to the MCA the case of Alan Ridley, a 46-year-old father of four, who died two days after starting a course of Zyban. An open verdict was recorded at the inquest. GlaxoSmithKline said: \"Zyban is generally well tolerated ... and there is no evidence of increased risk associated with the use of this medicine.\" The reports by GPs had raised no additional safety issues. Manchester GP Chris Steele, who has prescribed the drug for 400 patients, said the 270,000 patients who had used Zyban by the end of December may now have risen to nearly a third of a million. \"These are people at high risk of serious events like heart attacks or strokes happening anyway because of smoking. Zyban is not a miracle cure but one in three users will stop smoking and still not be smoking in a year. That is twice as effective as a nicotine patch.\" Patients on Zyban are usually prescribed one tablet for the first few days of their course and then go on to two tablets, but periods of treatment should not last more than nine weeks. Dr Steele said: \"If a patient is disturbed by any side-effects, I have reduced them from two tablets a day to one a day, and they have continued their course of medication.\"",

In a call to arms to 3,000 party activists in Glasgow, the prime minister claimed New Labour had grown up in office and that Britain was on the brink of \"the biggest progressive political advance for a century\". With one eye on election day - which many political observers believe will fall on May 3 - he called on party workers to go out to the country with heads held high, spelling out the message of the government's successes. \"Whenever this fight comes, go into it with confidence, go into it knowing we have won the intellectual and political debate in this country,\" he said. As if to kickstart activists he gave them a series of new policies to sell to families, the unemployed and announced a further crackdown on crime. Eyecatching among the raft of measures was a drugs register which all convicted dealers will be forced to sign. Like the paedophile register, it would be open only to police.

The ruling Zanu-PF party is trying to block the popular opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, from running for president next year by bringing criminal charges designed to bar him from office. It is also packing the courts with compliant judges, unlikely to overturn any sentencing on appeal. While Mr Tsvangirai's disqualification would be a blow to his party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), it could also prove highly destabilising, given the government's deep unpopularity and Zimbabwe's burgeoning economic crisis; economists warn that it will face a shortage of staple foods within six months. Harare is also trying to limit the damage to its image overseas. The information minister, Jonathon Moyo, said the government felt no obligation to abide by a Harare high court decision yesterday blocking the authorities from expelling Joseph Winter of the BBC, and Mercedes Sayagues, who works for the Guardian's sister paper in Johannesburg, the Mail and Guardian. On another front, Zanu-PF is trying to force the leaders of the overwhelmingly white Commercial Farmers Union to resign, warning that more farmers will die if they do not side with the government. The ruling party's main target, however, is Mr Tsvangirai. Last week he was belatedly charged with incitement to violence - five months after a speech in which he warned Mr Mugabe that if he did not go peaceably he could be removed by force. The government claims that the MDC leader was advocating revolution. Mr Tsvangirai says he was just warning of the likely consequences of an increasingly unpopular president trying to cling on to power at all costs. The MDC believes that the government waited to charge its leader because it was manipulating the courts to ensure that a conviction would be upheld on appeal. Earlier this month, Zimbabwe's justice minister told the country's independent supreme court judges that their safety could not be guaranteed unless they resigned immediately. The chief justice bowed to the pressure and quit, but four other judges have refused to step down. The MDC's legal affairs chief, David Coultard, sees a pattern in the recent events. \"It's quite clearly part of a coordinated plan to make sure [Tsvangirai] is convicted and cannot run for president,\" he said. \"If that happens Mugabe will go for an early election.\" Intimidation has not been restricted to those in the courts and opposition figures, however.

Take a look at the coverage of Baroness Jay of Paddington last week. Following her decision to leave the cabinet, the high-achieving, 61-year-old peer is still being defined as the daughter of prime minister James Callaghan, rather than the woman who, among other things, successfully presided over stage one of the reform of the second chamber of the Lords.

My brother, who is 18 months older than me, laboured under the usual expectations of an older son, but he was never expected to grow up to be beautiful, glamorous and on TV.</p> <p>If my brief love affair with the stage had lasted a lifetime, I'm pretty convinced I would have earned more money by taking a pound for every time someone said: \"Don't you look like your mum?\" than I would for the actual acting. For a while I did cherish a vague ambition to follow in my mother's footsteps, but one too many experiences with some unpalatable actors convinced me it wasn't my vocation.</p> <p>There may even have been an inkling that I would not be able to replicate her success and I knew comparison would be inevitable.

Take the Dahl effect - passed down two generations from Roald to Tessa to her now notorious daughter Sophie. The unspoken suggestion lingers as to whether she would have made it as a size 14 model had she not had a famous second name. And would she? Conveniently, nobody can say. And inconveniently for Dahl, she will never be able to prove that she could to do it on her own.</p> <p>For women growing up burdened with the assumptions of parental influence, there is an inevitable quandary to address before they even embark on one type of career.

Hudson appears to have accepted the inevitability of inheriting her mother's mantle. She may have felt there was no point trying to do otherwise, which is why she didn't embargo journalists' inevitable questions about her family. A few Oscar nominations down the road, though, she might just want to call upon the woman's prerogative to change her mind.",

The emeritus professor of social administration at Lancaster University, he was best known as co-author of a series of books on the role of the state and social services that promoted the concept of decentralisation. Born in East Hoathly, Sussex, Roger was brought up in Surrey: the atmosphere of freedom, kindness and humanity in his rural childhood home, and at Frensham Heights school, Farnham, contrasted greatly with what he was to find in the wider world - and it had a lasting effect on him. Following national service, he took a BSc in economics at the London School of Economics (1952-55), and the focus of his concern developed from a belief in world government - as the way to world peace - to the sharper focus of people's lives in the workplace. He set about this with characteristic energy and enthusiasm, and, after graduation, worked for two years in factories in Britain, Canada and America, where workers' lack of fulfilment and feelings of powerlessness made a big impact on him. He took a post-graduate diploma in industrial sociology (1957-59), and research for his doctorate on self- governing firms (1965-71) took him to the common-ownership firm Scott Bader Commonwealth, which he advised on personnel and training, writing several pamphlets about the benefits of industrial democracy. In 1966, he became a lecturer in Professor Richard Titmuss's groundbreaking social administration department at the LSE, where he was first exposed to social service organisation and practice - to which his ideas on industrial organisation and democracy naturally transferred themselves. In 1974, Roger was appointed to the chair of the newly-founded department of social admini- stration at Lancaster, where he pursued the idea of the \"patch\", or neighbourhood, approach to service provision, working with projects in social services departments in Normanton, East Sussex, Tyneside and Salford, which had moved away from centralised control. During the 1980s, he co-authored a series of books and monographs which advocated the decentralisation of local authority social services, notably Going Local: Neighbourhood Social Services (1981), When Social Services Are Local (1984), Decentralising Social Services: A Model For Change (1984), A Community Social Worker Handbook (1987) and Creating A Responsive Public Service (1990).

      "bodyText": "The Australian Labor party was re-elected by a landslide in Queensland on Saturday as the mainstream conservative parties collapsed under pressure from the rightwing One Nation party. It won an estimated 69 of the state parliament's 89 seats, overcoming last year's vote-rigging scandal which prompted the premier, Peter Beattie, to call the election. If the 10.4% swing to Labor in Queensland is repeated in the the federal elections due by November, Labor will easily regain power from John Howard's conservative coaltion of Liberal and National parties, and One Nation's leader, Pauline Hanson, could win a much-coveted senate seat. One Nation, which is pledged to stop Asian immigration and Aboriginal state aid, took about 9% of the total vote and up to 40% in the constituencies it contested, taking three seats. \"It is a clear indication that One Nation is not finished. We are well and truly still here and we will work towards the next election,\" Ms Hanson said. She announced plan to transform One Nation within three years into a party capable of forming a government. The party won 11 seats in the 1998 Queensland election, but it virtually collapsed after it was abandoned by all its Queensland MPs and deregistered in several states. A year ago Ms Hanson tearfully admitted that she was on the verge of bankruptcy; a month ago, the party was polling just 4%. Its fortunes were revived by a week of aggressive campaigning in which Ms Hanson condemned asylum seekers as \"queue jumpers\" who were \"bringing diseases\" into Australia and argued that a formal apology to Aborigines for the way white settlers treated them would lead to a rash of compensation claims. Analysts believe its revival is due to rural voters' increasing disillusionment with the mainstream right rather than support for Ms Hanson's extreme policies. Paul Reynolds of the University of Queensland said the party had toned down its racist utterances and become much more focused on domestic issues. It concentrated its attacks on petrol prices, the 10% goods and services tax, market reforms which have hurt rural areas,and Canbarra politician's neglect of rural voters. The result was not a shift away from the mainstream parties, Dr Reynolds said.\"It's not a de-alignment, it's a realignment, as conservative voters have moved to Labor.\" Half its 1998 supporters had switched to Labor, he added. One Nation's impact on the federal elections will depend on the success of its strategy of directing its supporters to put sitting MPs last on their preferential ballot papers. The tactic unseated several conservative politicians in Western Australia on February 10, and is deeply troubling Mr Howard's Coalition, which has a slender federal majority.",

It causes hardening of the skin on the hands and face, and pain in the joints. In some forms it hardens internal tissue, causing organ failure and death.",

Who could possibly replace the man who had represented their community for 22 years? In a nation still recovering from civil war, Shamseddin (the name means \"sun of religion\" in Arabic) championed reconciliation between Christian and Muslim, and between Shi'ite and Sunni.</p> <p>Shamseddin wrote some 25 books, on issues ranging from Shi'ite history and social ethics to the status of women in Islam. He epitomised a scholastic tradition that had flourished quietly for centuries in Lebanon's most impoverished and neglected region, the southern Jabal Amil. But the imam found himself dragged willy-nilly into politics and, as patron of a strong Shi'ite bloc in Lebanon's national assembly, he made enemies. Would-be assassins targeted him twice - once, near his home in 1990, and again, in 1997, while he was praying at a Beirut mosque.</p> <p>Shamseddin was born to Lebanese parents in Najaf, southern Iraq, the spiritual cradle of Shi'ism. There he studied Arab sciences and Islamic jurisprudence, and argued for divine governance according to sharia law. However, returning to a religiously heterogeneous Lebanon in 1968 changed his views. In 1985, he coined the term adadiyya, or dialogue between the Abrahamic faiths.</p> <p>Initially, he basked in the reflected glory of his charismatic mentor, Imam Sayid Musa Sadr. He served as Sadr's deputy on the higher Shi'ite council and promoted Sadr's new movement, Amal, which galvanised the Shi'ite downtrodden. For while Shi'ites represented the largest single sect in Lebanon, they played third fiddle to Beirut and Tripoli's Christian and Sunni elites.</p> <p>Three events in 1978 irrevocably altered Shamseddin's life. First came the disappearance of Musa Sadr in Libya. This mysterious affair played to the archetypal Shi'ite motif of a hidden imam, who would return victorious on some unspecified day of judgment. For Shamseddin to claim Sadr's throne was obviously unthinkable. Only in March 1994 was he named president of the higher council. Yet as Musa Sadr's de facto successor, he gained renewed authority.</p> <p>Also in 1978 came Ayatollah Khomeini's Islamic revolution in Iran. Lebanese Shi'ites were elated and Shamseddin welcomed Tehran's subsequent patronage. All the same, he cherished his community's autonomy, and realised that Iranian-style velayat e-faqih (or rule by religious jurists) would alienate his more worldly adherents.</p> <p>Finally, Israeli incursions in 1978 exacerbated Shi'ite animosity towards Palestinians, whom they blamed for these reprisals. Four years later, though, a much larger invasion displaced thousands of Shi'ites, leading the imam to demand \"total civil resistance against Israel\". Paradoxically, this campaign also spawned Hizbullah, a rival to Amal.</p> <p>Shamseddin rejected zionism, yet grudgingly accepted the reality of Israel. Just prior to the 1973 Geneva talks, he implored Arabs to adopt a \"new style\" to protect themselves against the \"dangers of peace with the Jews\". Hizbullah may have later boasted of marching on Jerusalem, but Shamseddin was more circumspect. \"If Israel withdraws from Lebanon,\" he told an American audience in 1995, \"our differences would be over. There would be no more bullets between us.\"</p> <p>He also fought against corruption and injustice. He highlighted the plight of poverty-stricken farmers, railed against \"monstrous\" government institutions and protested about human rights abuses. Last May, he condemned the absence of an independent judiciary in Lebanon, a body \"trusted by the weak, not an object of whispers and accusations\".</p> <p>He opposed sectarianism with equal virulence. \"There is no Lebanon without its Christians\", he once declared. When Hizbullah threatened to wreak vengeance on Jezzine, a largely Christian stronghold from which Israeli forces withdrew in 1998, the imam ordered the guerrillas to respect residents as fellow Lebanese. In 1999, he warned against \"returning Lebanon to partition in the guise of decentralisation\".</p> <p>Never fond of secularism, he argued against using civil marriage as a tool for fostering inter-communal harmony. Increasingly, his gratitude to Damascus as \"a guarantor of civil peace\" irritated those Lebanese who yearned to see Syrian troops leave.</p> <p>Ultimately, Shamseddin will be remembered for two major successes: indirectly ensuring the departure of Israeli troops from Lebanon last year, and winning a place at the high table for Lebanon's Shi'ites. He is survived by a second wife and three sons.</p> <p>Mohammed Mahdi Shamseddin, Shi'ite religious leader, born 1933; died January 11 2001</p>",

All the same, he cherished his community's autonomy, and realised that Iranian-style velayat e-faqih (or rule by religious jurists) would alienate his more worldly adherents. Finally, Israeli incursions in 1978 exacerbated Shi'ite animosity towards Palestinians, whom they blamed for these reprisals. Four years later, though, a much larger invasion displaced thousands of Shi'ites, leading the imam to demand \"total civil resistance against Israel\". Paradoxically, this campaign also spawned Hizbullah, a rival to Amal. Shamseddin rejected zionism, yet grudgingly accepted the reality of Israel. Just prior to the 1973 Geneva talks, he implored Arabs to adopt a \"new style\" to protect themselves against the \"dangers of peace with the Jews\". Hizbullah may have later boasted of marching on Jerusalem, but Shamseddin was more circumspect. \"If Israel withdraws from Lebanon,\" he told an American audience in 1995, \"our differences would be over. There would be no more bullets between us.\" He also fought against corruption and injustice. He highlighted the plight of poverty-stricken farmers, railed against \"monstrous\" government institutions and protested about human rights abuses. Last May, he condemned the absence of an independent judiciary in Lebanon, a body \"trusted by the weak, not an object of whispers and accusations\". He opposed sectarianism with equal virulence. \"There is no Lebanon without its Christians\", he once declared. When Hizbullah threatened to wreak vengeance on Jezzine, a largely Christian stronghold from which Israeli forces withdrew in 1998, the imam ordered the guerrillas to respect residents as fellow Lebanese. In 1999, he warned against \"returning Lebanon to partition in the guise of decentralisation\". Never fond of secularism, he argued against using civil marriage as a tool for fostering inter-communal harmony. Increasingly, his gratitude to Damascus as \"a guarantor of civil peace\" irritated those Lebanese who yearned to see Syrian troops leave. Ultimately, Shamseddin will be remembered for two major successes: indirectly ensuring the departure of Israeli troops from Lebanon last year, and winning a place at the high table for Lebanon's Shi'ites. He is survived by a second wife and three sons. Mohammed Mahdi Shamseddin, Shi'ite religious leader, born 1933; died January 11 2001",

      "body": "<p>Gordon Brown achieved a breakthrough in the fight against global poverty when he secured backing from the world's richest nations to deliver universal primary education, cut infant mortality by two-thirds and halve the number of poor people by 2015. </p> <p>These are the UN's international development targets and for the first time finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven nations - the US, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada - made an explicit commitment to reach the goals set by the UN in 1995. </p> <p>In the G7's first summit of the year, Mr Brown led the development part of the discussion on Saturday with strong support from his Italian hosts. Speaking at a press conference later, the chancellor said: \"The agreement here today that we are going to make it a priority to get resources channelled to social services - health and education - is very important.\" </p> <p>G7 sources said the UN targets had long been regarded as outside the domain of finance ministers and the responsibility of the development community and UN agencies. </p> <p>But now that the people in charge of the finances of some of the world's richest countries were on record as wanting to achieve them, there was every prospect that they would become more than aspirations. </p> <p>A programme of work has begun which it is hoped will lead to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund being required to spell out exactly how the UN targets will be achieved in the countries they lend to and supervise. </p> <p>Mr Brown's initiative will be taken forward in London next Monday when he and Clare Short, the international development secretary, host a conference on child poverty, which will be attended by UN secretary general Kofi Annan, Jim Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, Horst Koehler, managing director of the IMF, and addessed by video link by Nelson Mandela. </p> <p>It wil be followed up by the Budget on March 7, when the chancellor is expected to announce a tax credit to encourage pharmaceuticals companies to devote more resources to developing drugs for eradicating preventable diseases such as malaria and TB. </p> <p>The spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank and the G7 leaders' summit in Genoa in the summer will also be focal points. </p> <p>Mr Brown and his G7 counterparts discussed progress of debt relief, noting that 22 of the 41 countries originally identified were receiving assistance under the enhanced, heavily indebted poor countries initiative and that many of the rest were prevented from doing so by armed conflicts. </p> <p>But they did not talk in any detail about a proposal from Drop the Debt, successor to the Jubilee 2000 campaign, to call in outside auditors to see whether the IMF and World Bank could afford to write off more debt. </p> <p>Jamie Drummond, spokesman for Drop the Debt, said: \"The poorest countries cannot fight poverty when scarce cash, which could go towards health care and education, is instead going on payments to the IMF and World Bank. The G7 are on dangerous ground and the 2015 poverty alleviation targets will remain a pipe dream until they agree to deeper debt cancellation and a new deal on debt for the Genoa summit.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown achieved a breakthrough in the fight against global poverty when he secured backing from the world's richest nations to deliver universal primary education, cut infant mortality by two-thirds and halve the number of poor people by 2015. These are the UN's international development targets and for the first time finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven nations - the US, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada - made an explicit commitment to reach the goals set by the UN in 1995. In the G7's first summit of the year, Mr Brown led the development part of the discussion on Saturday with strong support from his Italian hosts. Speaking at a press conference later, the chancellor said: \"The agreement here today that we are going to make it a priority to get resources channelled to social services - health and education - is very important.\" G7 sources said the UN targets had long been regarded as outside the domain of finance ministers and the responsibility of the development community and UN agencies. But now that the people in charge of the finances of some of the world's richest countries were on record as wanting to achieve them, there was every prospect that they would become more than aspirations. A programme of work has begun which it is hoped will lead to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund being required to spell out exactly how the UN targets will be achieved in the countries they lend to and supervise. Mr Brown's initiative will be taken forward in London next Monday when he and Clare Short, the international development secretary, host a conference on child poverty, which will be attended by UN secretary general Kofi Annan, Jim Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, Horst Koehler, managing director of the IMF, and addessed by video link by Nelson Mandela. It wil be followed up by the Budget on March 7, when the chancellor is expected to announce a tax credit to encourage pharmaceuticals companies to devote more resources to developing drugs for eradicating preventable diseases such as malaria and TB. The spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank and the G7 leaders' summit in Genoa in the summer will also be focal points. Mr Brown and his G7 counterparts discussed progress of debt relief, noting that 22 of the 41 countries originally identified were receiving assistance under the enhanced, heavily indebted poor countries initiative and that many of the rest were prevented from doing so by armed conflicts. But they did not talk in any detail about a proposal from Drop the Debt, successor to the Jubilee 2000 campaign, to call in outside auditors to see whether the IMF and World Bank could afford to write off more debt. Jamie Drummond, spokesman for Drop the Debt, said: \"The poorest countries cannot fight poverty when scarce cash, which could go towards health care and education, is instead going on payments to the IMF and World Bank. The G7 are on dangerous ground and the 2015 poverty alleviation targets will remain a pipe dream until they agree to deeper debt cancellation and a new deal on debt for the Genoa summit.\"",

      "body": "<p>Labour loves a target. It has targets for teachers, targets for pupils, targets for hospitals, targets for the police, targets for court clerks, targets for traffic wardens. Targets have not been this popular since Henry V told his archers to twang off a few practice arrows ahead of Agincourt. </p> <p>In the circumstances, it is only natural that the Bank of England should have a target - to keep inflation at the level laid down by the chancellor of the exchequer when he handed over control of interest rates. Gordon Brown was precise - the target was not 2% or 3%, but 2.5% - it would be for inflation excluding mortgage interest payments, and he would be just as cross if inflation were too low as he would be if it came in too high. </p> <p>That, at least, was the theory. The purpose of targets is that performance can be measured, and it is easy to see how the Bank has fared. Because it takes around 18 months for monetary policy to have full effect, we can only judge the monetary policy committee since the beginning of 1999, in which time inflation has been consistently below 2.5%. Last week's figures showed that the underlying inflation rate had dropped to 1.8%, its lowest level since the series began in 1976. What is more, according to the Bank's own projections, it will stay below 2.5% for the next two years, climbing back to its target level only at the very end of the Bank's two-year forecasting period. </p> <p>Actually, regular readers of the Bank's quarterly inflation report will not be surprised by the notion that inflation will back at 2.5% in two years' time, because that is what the Bank always says. Tucked away in the inflation report there is a paragraph that says inflation has come in a bit lower than was expected three months ago but that over the medium term price pressures will build up, thus returning inflation to its target without the MPC having to do anything about it. </p> <p><strong>Oblique reference</strong><br> </p> <p>Mervyn King, the Bank's deputy governor, said last week that, given the lags involved in monetary policy, there was no point doing anything now artificially to return to the target because that would risk inflation going too high, which would necessitate harmful remedial action. </p> <p>If Mr King thought this oblique reference to the risks of returning to boom and bust would be enough to deter any criticism from our hawkish chancellor, he was almost certainly right. However, the deputy governor's argument raises a number of interesting points. First, if monetary policy only works with a lag - which it does - and inflation is well below 2.5%, this seems conclusive proof that the MPC was wrong 18 months ago to have tightened policy so aggressively. Logically, if the Bank was wrong about inflationary risks 18 months ago, it might be wrong about inflationary risks again now. That certainly seems to be what another member of the MPC, Sushil Wadhwani, thinks. He said last Friday that the Bank should publish the inflation forecasts made by individual members of the committee, a move that would lift the lid on one of the world's worst kept economic secrets - that Sushil thinks Mervyn has got it wrong. </p> <p>Secondly, there seems to be an asymmetry in the Bank's thinking, such that when inflation is below target it is invariably a temporary phenomenon that will be reversed automatically at some point in the future (two years) but when inflation is above target it will go on rising unchecked unless the MPC steps in and does something about it. </p> <p>Finally, when you think about it, this state of affairs could carry on pretty much indefinitely, with the Bank saying every quarter that inflation has somehow turned out to be lower than expected three months earlier but that all will be hunky-dory 24 months hence. </p> <p>However, let us be fair. Attempting to hit a precise inflation target with one policy weapon is supremely difficult, perhaps impossible. The fact that the Bank has managed to keep inflation within spitting distance of 2.5% for so long is no mean feat and, given Britain's recent economic record, it is understandably concerned about recidivist behaviour. There are plenty of reasons, fully documented in the inflation report, for thinking that there could be problems ahead.

Part of this has to do with a low-inflation environment which people expect to persist, and the Bank may have played its part in engendering the new mood.

      "bodyText": "Labour loves a target. It has targets for teachers, targets for pupils, targets for hospitals, targets for the police, targets for court clerks, targets for traffic wardens. Targets have not been this popular since Henry V told his archers to twang off a few practice arrows ahead of Agincourt. In the circumstances, it is only natural that the Bank of England should have a target - to keep inflation at the level laid down by the chancellor of the exchequer when he handed over control of interest rates. Gordon Brown was precise - the target was not 2% or 3%, but 2.5% - it would be for inflation excluding mortgage interest payments, and he would be just as cross if inflation were too low as he would be if it came in too high. That, at least, was the theory. The purpose of targets is that performance can be measured, and it is easy to see how the Bank has fared. Because it takes around 18 months for monetary policy to have full effect, we can only judge the monetary policy committee since the beginning of 1999, in which time inflation has been consistently below 2.5%. Last week's figures showed that the underlying inflation rate had dropped to 1.8%, its lowest level since the series began in 1976. What is more, according to the Bank's own projections, it will stay below 2.5% for the next two years, climbing back to its target level only at the very end of the Bank's two-year forecasting period. Actually, regular readers of the Bank's quarterly inflation report will not be surprised by the notion that inflation will back at 2.5% in two years' time, because that is what the Bank always says. Tucked away in the inflation report there is a paragraph that says inflation has come in a bit lower than was expected three months ago but that over the medium term price pressures will build up, thus returning inflation to its target without the MPC having to do anything about it. Oblique reference Mervyn King, the Bank's deputy governor, said last week that, given the lags involved in monetary policy, there was no point doing anything now artificially to return to the target because that would risk inflation going too high, which would necessitate harmful remedial action. If Mr King thought this oblique reference to the risks of returning to boom and bust would be enough to deter any criticism from our hawkish chancellor, he was almost certainly right. However, the deputy governor's argument raises a number of interesting points. First, if monetary policy only works with a lag - which it does - and inflation is well below 2.5%, this seems conclusive proof that the MPC was wrong 18 months ago to have tightened policy so aggressively. Logically, if the Bank was wrong about inflationary risks 18 months ago, it might be wrong about inflationary risks again now. That certainly seems to be what another member of the MPC, Sushil Wadhwani, thinks. He said last Friday that the Bank should publish the inflation forecasts made by individual members of the committee, a move that would lift the lid on one of the world's worst kept economic secrets - that Sushil thinks Mervyn has got it wrong. Secondly, there seems to be an asymmetry in the Bank's thinking, such that when inflation is below target it is invariably a temporary phenomenon that will be reversed automatically at some point in the future (two years) but when inflation is above target it will go on rising unchecked unless the MPC steps in and does something about it. Finally, when you think about it, this state of affairs could carry on pretty much indefinitely, with the Bank saying every quarter that inflation has somehow turned out to be lower than expected three months earlier but that all will be hunky-dory 24 months hence. However, let us be fair. Attempting to hit a precise inflation target with one policy weapon is supremely difficult, perhaps impossible. The fact that the Bank has managed to keep inflation within spitting distance of 2.5% for so long is no mean feat and, given Britain's recent economic record, it is understandably concerned about recidivist behaviour. There are plenty of reasons, fully documented in the inflation report, for thinking that there could be problems ahead. Last week's labour market data, for example, showed that unemployment is coming down while earnings are starting to nudge up. Skill shortages are becoming more common, threatening to bid up the price of labour. Figures from the high street show that consumer demand - buoyed by high levels of employment - is strong.

To crown it all, investment performance has been poor, underlining an age-old defect in the economy - the failure of supply potential to rise in line with strong consumer demand. So, while the trade-off between the four big macro-economic indicators - growth, unemployment, inflation and the balance of payments - is as good as it has been since the early 1960s, some on the MPC are concerned that the future could be a carbon copy of the past and that after eight years of growth this is the time for maximum vigilance.

Since the Commission will only be auditing the accounts retrospectively, party strategists are hoping to draw up an informal cross-party memorandum of understanding to ensure that all parties adhere to the same rules - but don't hold your breath. As Dr Stephen Coleman, director of the e-democracy programme at the Hansard Society, warns: \"The big issue of the election after this will be breaches of campaign spending. The parties have barely thought this through, from the simple fact that MPs will have to take down their personal websites as soon as an election is called, to buying up bogus websites and the costs of companies which create partisan links to the parties.\" Creative accounting - always a part of election campaigns - will surely spread to the net. \u0095 Matthew Tempest is a politics reporter",

According to Welt am Sonntag, the prosecutors have information from a former flat mate of Mr Fischer's that his flat was a shelter for urban guerrillas, particularly the RAF. Last week another witness claimed that the radical group to which Mr Fischer belonged was used by the RAF as a channel through which to recruit members. According to the magazine Focus, Ms Schiller stands firmly by her claim, in an update of her autobiography, that she stayed in the future foreign minister's flat. Mr Fischer said he could not rule out the possibility that she had stayed in a different flat in the same building, and acknowledged that he might have met her over breakfast, but during the time before she was sought by the police.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Markus Lupfer</strong> </p> <p> Markus Lupfer, 30, probably the best known of the designers featured here, is a series of contradictions. He is a German with a giggly sense of humour. He claims to work in fashion \"just to have a good time for myself\" but later reveals dreams of starting a fashion empire similar to LVMH. His forthcoming collection - \"Let's say kind of romantic hi-tech\" - sounds an improbable clash, yet when he elaborates, it seems logical: \"I mix strong spectrum colours, like black and red, and strong materials, like Chinese cashmere and silk.\" Finally, his clothes are uniquely attention-grabbing, but you and I could wear them every day. Even the American fashion press, who tend towards the conservative, have taken him to their hearts. </p> <p>After fashion college, Lupfer worked for two years at Clements Ribeiro and the collection he is showing today, \"Proper Little Madam\", marks his fifth season. His show is now a recognised highlight of London fashion week, but will we lose him to Europe, as we have so many of our talented designers? \"Oh no! I would find it so boring back in Germany! This is my home.\" </p> <p><strong>David Wyatt</strong> </p> <p> For the past two seasons, David Wyatt, 29, has been the true darling of the British fashion press. His simple yet desirably cool clothes had at least one fashion editor standing on her seat and cheering at his show last season - and this from a profession in which a raised eyebrow is seen as an extreme emotional response. </p> <p>Wyatt trained with that other fashion pet, Marc Jacobs, while the New York designer was consulting for Iceberg and Wyatt says the two share a sense of aesthetics. \"I have always liked that clean-cut American thing, clean and simple sportswear, which is why I wanted to work for him in the first place.\" Certainly Wyatt's spring/summer 2001 collection - one of last season's most eagerly awaited - recalled elements of Jacobs: low hipster trousers were slouchy and elegant, short shift dresses were classic and simple. </p> <p>For autumn/winter 2001, Wyatt has found a new kind of touchstone. \"This time, the look is a mix of English schoolgirls and The Great Gatsby - white tights and simple jackets - with a real washed-out, dreamy, summery feel to it. And because it's winter, there are some really dramatic, rich, almost Austrian pieces - I just love that really decadent, luxurious look.\" </p> <p><strong>Marcus Constable</strong></p> <p> \"You know, I had tickets for the McQueen show last season, but I didn't go. I'd had enough of fashion by that point.\" Gosh, the young are hard to please these days, aren't they? But the coolness of Marcus Constable, 32, is excusable. His collection for spring/summer 2001, which was his second, was widely praised. The asymmetric tops and sexy pleated mini-skirts dovetailed perfectly with fashion's return to the new and improved 80s. He also designs a capsule collection for Top Shop which, in London, is about as big an honour as a young designer can get. </p> <p>He describes his style as \"strict and prim\", by which he means the focus is on tailoring. In his forthcoming collection, there is, as ever, an Edwardian feel to the clothes, but with a twist. He cites this season's dual inspirations as \"a felt sculptor and the manta ray, in that I have slit and draped big pieces of felt, then cut them into jackets borrowing the shape of the ray\". The flirty little fishtails on the back of the skirts give an aquatic feel to this collection coming from a most English designer. </p> <p><strong>Sara Berman</strong></p> <p> It is a strange fact of fashion journalism that \"wearable\" is often read as a euphemism for \"boring\". Such instinctive reinterpretation should not be applied to the following sentence: Sara Berman's clothes are deliciously wearable. </p> <p>Berman, 25, won the Marks &amp; Spencer New Generation Award last season. She was one of the highlights of fashion week - and it was her first collection on schedule. She designs sweetly elegant 1950s-inspired clothes that flatter. There are no self-indulgent forays into extremist, unwearable designs: \"I don't understand this whole slashing the top of the dress to symbolise the rape of the woman, or whatever. Fashion should be about making a woman feel sexy, cute and good.\" </p> <p>Her autumn/winter 2001 collection sticks with the 50s theme (\"Fashion was so romantic then but grown-up\"). But the clothes are not anachronistic: \"A-line skirts with pleats make your bum look big, so my skirts are straight down the hips, then pleat out.\" Other stand-out pieces are tops with enormous knitted corsages - \"Not as ridiculous as those on Sex and the City!\" </p> <p><strong>Tracey Mulligan</strong></p> <p> Light, airy and elegant is probably the best way to describe clothing from Mulligan. Skirts tend to be A-line with sweet but not cloying patterns, while the men's clothing is fitted but comfortable. Going to a Mulligan show in the middle of London fashion week can feel like taking a breath of crisp air after leaving a smoky, crowded pub. </p> <p>Tracey Mulligan's collection for autumn/winter 2001 uses the 50s as a touchstone in terms of styles (capri trousers, boat-necks) and prints (abstract art reinterpreted and a \"Scribble Print\" inspired by the original cover of The Naked Lunch). </p> <p>In contrast with the lightness of her designs, Mulligan, 37, is trenchant in her views, particularly on the problems faced by British designers. \"The press is only interested in the new, the sensational or the popstars, and I won't use Posh Spice just to get in the papers [as British designer Maria Grachvogel did last year].\" </p> <p>Despite such problems, Mulligan has won Marks &amp; Spencer New Generation sponsorship three seasons in a row and has been nominated for the British Fashion Awards New Generation Award.</p>",

Such instinctive reinterpretation should not be applied to the following sentence: Sara Berman's clothes are deliciously wearable. Berman, 25, won the Marks &amp; Spencer New Generation Award last season. She was one of the highlights of fashion week - and it was her first collection on schedule. She designs sweetly elegant 1950s-inspired clothes that flatter. There are no self-indulgent forays into extremist, unwearable designs: \"I don't understand this whole slashing the top of the dress to symbolise the rape of the woman, or whatever. Fashion should be about making a woman feel sexy, cute and good.\" Her autumn/winter 2001 collection sticks with the 50s theme (\"Fashion was so romantic then but grown-up\"). But the clothes are not anachronistic: \"A-line skirts with pleats make your bum look big, so my skirts are straight down the hips, then pleat out.\" Other stand-out pieces are tops with enormous knitted corsages - \"Not as ridiculous as those on Sex and the City!\" Tracey Mulligan Light, airy and elegant is probably the best way to describe clothing from Mulligan. Skirts tend to be A-line with sweet but not cloying patterns, while the men's clothing is fitted but comfortable. Going to a Mulligan show in the middle of London fashion week can feel like taking a breath of crisp air after leaving a smoky, crowded pub. Tracey Mulligan's collection for autumn/winter 2001 uses the 50s as a touchstone in terms of styles (capri trousers, boat-necks) and prints (abstract art reinterpreted and a \"Scribble Print\" inspired by the original cover of The Naked Lunch). In contrast with the lightness of her designs, Mulligan, 37, is trenchant in her views, particularly on the problems faced by British designers. \"The press is only interested in the new, the sensational or the popstars, and I won't use Posh Spice just to get in the papers [as British designer Maria Grachvogel did last year].\" Despite such problems, Mulligan has won Marks &amp; Spencer New Generation sponsorship three seasons in a row and has been nominated for the British Fashion Awards New Generation Award.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Being an air stewardess is bound to drive you to drink or madness. Dishing out frigid meals you know no one likes is bad enough, but having to go through that safety demonstration - faux blowing into the whistle to attract attention and everything - when passengers either aren't remotely interested or else regard you as some performing animal must gnaw away at your sanity. </p> <p>This must be - in part at least - the explanation for Diane's decision in <strong> Best Of Both Worlds</strong> (BBC1, Sunday) to take up with and then marry Italian Mark while her other husband baked bread in Wales. That, and the inevitable personality disorder which must result from looking a bit like Daryl Hannah and a bit like a newsreader on a regional news programme. </p> <p>For really there is little else to explain Diane's actions. Unusually for writer Paul Abbott, Best Of Both Worlds' characters are sketchy and hollow, while the plot hurtled along with the elegance and measure of a runaway rickshaw. </p> <p>Occasionally sensitive and true, Best Of Both Worlds too often errs on the side of unrealistic clumsiness. There are gloriously accurate details - Diane's mischievous streak is apparent, as is her d\u00e9tente with her mother-in-law - but the whole fails to convince. Apart from a vague reference to her being an orphan, there isn't a hint of her motivation for beginning to lead a double life. </p> <p>Of course, there need not be one event which acts as a catalyst to spur Diane onwards, but there does need to be an empathetic character whom we can understand having a moment of madness. </p> <p>Unfortunately, there isn't. Diane is simply too blank and too shallow to be worth caring about. Indeed, the only time I felt slightly concerned for Diane was when she got into a blue taxi and out of a white one on the same trip. They must have magic cabs in Bologna. </p> <p>With James Cosmo popping up in a quarry as if he were hewn from the mountainside (which he may well have been), Best Of Both Worlds wasn't without its moments, but its opening episode was a thorough disappointment. Taking a holiday from your real life never seemed so uninspiring. </p> <p>One hundred rent boys in a weekend is enough for anyone (except, perhaps, Liberace) so <strong> 101 Rent Boys</strong> (Channel 4, Saturday) was simply overkill. </p> <p>Why film-makers Randy Barbato and Fenton Bailey settled on 101 male escorts to interview about their lives and not a round 100 is anyone's guess. (Personally, I think 99 Rent Boys sounds better than 101 but that's probably because I can imagine it being sung along to the tune of Ninety-Nine Red Balloons by Nena). </p> <p>Perhaps Randy (insert obvious joke here) and Fenton simply wanted to pay homage to 101 Dalmatians, though what rent boy and spotty dog have in common is beyond me. Aside from the fact that old men in country houses have a fondness for both. </p> <p>So in their keenness to commemorate Dodie Smith, not to mention dazzle us with tens of ten men who did it for money, Randy and Fenton forgot the practicalities of having over 100 subjects. Hence some of the rent boys only appeared to say \"I love my ass\" and \"my foreskin is very popular\". Hardly profound insight into the world of the male prostitute. But at least this gimmickry gave a hint of the documentary style-over-content approach. Rather than make sincere, intelligent points about the sex industry, the documentary opted for butt shots, muscled lads peeling off their T-shirts and speeded up footage of a drive down Santa Monica Boulevard, clich\u00e9-blurred neon and all. </p> <p>Still, once you got past all of that - and worked out exactly how much Randy and Fenton had spent paying each of the participants $50 for their time - 101 Rent Boys revealed some interesting stories. There was Bobby, who was 12 when he started having sex for money with the man in the lawn-mower shop. Dustin, meanwhile, told of how he watched his mother overdose on heroin. And a peculiar fellow named Dominic J Shufelino III was adamant that \"no one touches my hair\". Not even a hairdresser, by the looks of things. </p> <p>All peachy bottoms and tweaked nipples, 101 Rent Boys came over as titillation masquerading as a serious documentary. It should have been a lot cleverer: serious documentary disguised as cheap thrills. If only.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Being an air stewardess is bound to drive you to drink or madness. Dishing out frigid meals you know no one likes is bad enough, but having to go through that safety demonstration - faux blowing into the whistle to attract attention and everything - when passengers either aren't remotely interested or else regard you as some performing animal must gnaw away at your sanity. This must be - in part at least - the explanation for Diane's decision in Best Of Both Worlds (BBC1, Sunday) to take up with and then marry Italian Mark while her other husband baked bread in Wales. That, and the inevitable personality disorder which must result from looking a bit like Daryl Hannah and a bit like a newsreader on a regional news programme. For really there is little else to explain Diane's actions. Unusually for writer Paul Abbott, Best Of Both Worlds' characters are sketchy and hollow, while the plot hurtled along with the elegance and measure of a runaway rickshaw. Occasionally sensitive and true, Best Of Both Worlds too often errs on the side of unrealistic clumsiness. There are gloriously accurate details - Diane's mischievous streak is apparent, as is her d\u00e9tente with her mother-in-law - but the whole fails to convince. Apart from a vague reference to her being an orphan, there isn't a hint of her motivation for beginning to lead a double life. Of course, there need not be one event which acts as a catalyst to spur Diane onwards, but there does need to be an empathetic character whom we can understand having a moment of madness. Unfortunately, there isn't. Diane is simply too blank and too shallow to be worth caring about. Indeed, the only time I felt slightly concerned for Diane was when she got into a blue taxi and out of a white one on the same trip. They must have magic cabs in Bologna. With James Cosmo popping up in a quarry as if he were hewn from the mountainside (which he may well have been), Best Of Both Worlds wasn't without its moments, but its opening episode was a thorough disappointment. Taking a holiday from your real life never seemed so uninspiring. One hundred rent boys in a weekend is enough for anyone (except, perhaps, Liberace) so 101 Rent Boys (Channel 4, Saturday) was simply overkill. Why film-makers Randy Barbato and Fenton Bailey settled on 101 male escorts to interview about their lives and not a round 100 is anyone's guess. (Personally, I think 99 Rent Boys sounds better than 101 but that's probably because I can imagine it being sung along to the tune of Ninety-Nine Red Balloons by Nena). Perhaps Randy (insert obvious joke here) and Fenton simply wanted to pay homage to 101 Dalmatians, though what rent boy and spotty dog have in common is beyond me. Aside from the fact that old men in country houses have a fondness for both. So in their keenness to commemorate Dodie Smith, not to mention dazzle us with tens of ten men who did it for money, Randy and Fenton forgot the practicalities of having over 100 subjects. Hence some of the rent boys only appeared to say \"I love my ass\" and \"my foreskin is very popular\". Hardly profound insight into the world of the male prostitute. But at least this gimmickry gave a hint of the documentary style-over-content approach. Rather than make sincere, intelligent points about the sex industry, the documentary opted for butt shots, muscled lads peeling off their T-shirts and speeded up footage of a drive down Santa Monica Boulevard, clich\u00e9-blurred neon and all. Still, once you got past all of that - and worked out exactly how much Randy and Fenton had spent paying each of the participants $50 for their time - 101 Rent Boys revealed some interesting stories. There was Bobby, who was 12 when he started having sex for money with the man in the lawn-mower shop. Dustin, meanwhile, told of how he watched his mother overdose on heroin. And a peculiar fellow named Dominic J Shufelino III was adamant that \"no one touches my hair\". Not even a hairdresser, by the looks of things. All peachy bottoms and tweaked nipples, 101 Rent Boys came over as titillation masquerading as a serious documentary. It should have been a lot cleverer: serious documentary disguised as cheap thrills. If only.",

      "body": "<p>Your article (Germans knew of Holocaust horror, February 17) is a timely reminder, following Holocaust memorial day, that there was popular support for and knowledge of the camps. Dachau (1933-45) opened by interning 15,000-20,000 Bavarians, mainly socialist and communist workers. Was this known in Britain?</p> <p>Churchill's response to Jewish requests to bomb Auschwitz in 1944 was answered in a memo he sent to Eden on July 7: \"Get anything out of the Air Force that you can and invoke me if necessary.\" This was subverted by officials at the Foreign Office.</p> <p>Robert Gellately's new book may reveal the extent of German knowledge. I suggest that future studies broaden the scope to analyse the international decision-making process.

      "bodyText": "Your article (Germans knew of Holocaust horror, February 17) is a timely reminder, following Holocaust memorial day, that there was popular support for and knowledge of the camps. Dachau (1933-45) opened by interning 15,000-20,000 Bavarians, mainly socialist and communist workers. Was this known in Britain? Churchill's response to Jewish requests to bomb Auschwitz in 1944 was answered in a memo he sent to Eden on July 7: \"Get anything out of the Air Force that you can and invoke me if necessary.\" This was subverted by officials at the Foreign Office. Robert Gellately's new book may reveal the extent of German knowledge. I suggest that future studies broaden the scope to analyse the international decision-making process. A first step would be to open our government archives to enable historians to study why Dachau was able to operate for so long. Popular support for and knowledge of the camps was not confined to Germany. Responsibility lies with all citizens of all countries who had knowledge of the camps but did not act to halt them.

In his church, the Sunday School choir - children between the ages of five and 11 - sing hauntingly of Aids, the new tragedy. Once again, as was for so long under apartheid, only hope, a diminishing glint, sustains the congregation. It is enough, somehow.",

      "body": "<p>If we are honest about why Caspar David Friedrich has become Germany's best-loved painter and an icon of Germanness, it is because when we look at his landscapes we can smell the brimstone. We know, before the historians tell us, that Hitler liked his paintings. The emptiness and mysticism of Friedrich's vistas, populated only by the ghosts of German heroes, have made him the visual equivalent to Wagner: a grimly scarred anti-hero in the hall of cultural giants. Not that this has stood in his way. This Romantic landscape painter, all but forgotten after his death in 1843, has been rediscovered in the last 30 years. </p> <p>In the 1970s, German artists and film-makers returned to the charred forest of their cultural heritage to re-imagine a landscape shattered by Nazism, then muffled in felt by postwar blandness in the west and supranational Stalinism in the east. They went looking for Germany and what they found was Friedrich. </p> <p>In a series of performances called Occupations, the German painter Anselm Kiefer had himself photographed in Friedrichesque landscapes, with his back to us like the figures in Friedrich's paintings, giving a Nazi salute. His rival, Gerhard Richter, has also revisited Friedrich's landscape, but painted it blurred, as if seen through a car window on the autobahn on a rainy day. </p> <p>When Werner Herzog remade FW Murnau's film Nosferatu in 1979, he turned the story of a vampire invading a north German town into an essay on Romanticism. Characters ride across mist-covered hills straight out of Friedrich and, at the end, the vampire disappears into a vast, empty vista of sand and sky like the black-robed figure in Friedrich's greatest painting, The Monk by the Sea (c1809). Herzog sees the German landscape through Friedrich's paintings as a cursed place; the vampire is Hitler, and Friedrich. He might also be Joseph Beuys, whose face was as wasted as Klaus Kinski's in Nosferatu, and whose visionary performances and sculptures repeat Friedrich's appropriation of landscape as symbol. </p> <p>Beuys's installation of giant basalt pillars lying flat on the floor at Tate Modern, The End of the 20th Century (1983-5), is chillingly similar to the shattered blocks of Friedrich's The Sea of Ice (1823-4). It goes on, this fatal attraction to Friedrich. The British-based German artist Mariele Neudecker restages his landscapes as dioramas in glass vitrines, the liquid filling the tanks evoking the airlessness of Friedrich's forests and mountains. His paintings appear on the cover of almost any classic book connected to German Romanticism or the Gothic (a cursory inspection reveals him adorning both Goethe's Elective Affinities and Bram Stoker's Dracula). </p> <p>When the National Gallery's exhibition of 19th-century German paintings from collections in Berlin, opens next month there is one name who will pull in the crowds: Friedrich. Yet when the National Gallery bought Friedrich's Winter Landscape (c1811) in 1987, it was the first of his paintings to be acquired by a museum outside Germany. </p> <p>Friedrich has conquered the world, but at a price - a radical misunderstanding of who he was and what his art attempts to do. Friedrich has become the supreme icon of the German romantic visionary, the artist as mountain climber, throwing away his oxygen to get a better taste of the sublime, in love with the void, an image of German history. We love him like we love Dracula, because he makes us shudder. </p> <p>But Friedrich was not an operatic megalomaniac, but a man who participated in his own times rationally and with a politically astute eye. His letters, some of which are reprinted in Werner Hofmann's new study of the artist, might disappoint connoisseurs of Germanic nuttiness. Friedrich emerges as a critic of authority, a rebellious sympathiser with students jailed for protesting against autocratic regimes in the divided mini-states of Germany after the Congress of Vienna in 1815, and a passionate advocate of change - in short, a 19th- century liberal. </p> <p>The true father of Romantic landscape painting was Napoleon. The self-crowned Emperor's apparently invincible armies made the landscape of Europe visible in a new way as they marched across the continent. Friedrich saw the German statelets defeated humiliatingly by Napoleon, just as Goya experienced the annexation of Spain, and Turner saw Britain turn its sea into a defensive wall. </p> <p>But what made Friedrich see the danger of landscape was Napoleon's fall. Napoleon was brought down by space, weather, nature. His march on Russia ended in the empty wastes of a northern winter. Romantic landscape painting is convulsed by the Napoleonic wars; in Turner's Snowstorm: Hannibal and his Army Crossing the Alps (1812), Boney is personified by the ancient Carthaginian general dwarfed by the might of mountains and weather. </p> <p>In Friedrich's paintings he suffers a far worse fate. In 1814, the year after the retreat from Moscow, Friedrich painted The Chasseur in the Woods. A French soldier, cut off from his comrades, stands in a narrow clearing in a forest he will obviously never escape. A massing of brown firs rise as high as towers above him, sealing him inside. He seems to have given up, is resigned, letting his sword drag at his side, awed by the impenetrable, irresistible darkness that engulfs him. </p> <p>This Napoleonic Blair Witch Project figures Napoleon as one of his doomed soldiers, but instead of the Russian steppe it is the German forest that defeats him. This painting is often seen as a nationalist statement. Germany, suggests Friedrich, is a tangled, deathly forest that will swallow up its enemies. </p> <p>To see any of Friedrich's paintings as simply nationalist is, however, mistaken. His paintings are not celebrations of German mysticism so much as examinations of it. Friedrich uses the emptiness of the Baltic shore and the Thuringian forest to suggest the hubris of empire. He is not the prophet of German territorial ambition but its satirist. </p> <p>Friedrich's theme is the unconquerability of space. Human beings are tiny interlopers in a world they can never hope to rule. He exposes authority - of the monarchical states, Prussia and the rest, from which German liberals felt so alienated - as a cosmic vanity. In 1810 he sent his most famous pair of paintings, The Monk by the Sea and The Abbey in the Oak Wood, to be shown in the Prussian capital, Berlin; Prussia had been crushingly defeated by Napoleon in 1806. </p> <p>The paintings were a sensation and bought by the royal family; but are they assertions of national greatness, visions of the Teutonic eagle avenging itself? On the contrary, they are melancholy acceptances that defeat is not just temporary, but the human condition. </p> <p>Friedrich's landscape is a place where you cannot get a foothold. Try to conquer it, and you fall through the ice. Napoleon is doomed by this landscape, and so is Hitler. This art is not irrational; it is about the irrational. In his painting Woman at the Window (1822), coming to the National Gallery, a woman with her back to us - his wife, Caroline - looks out of a secluded interior, at a boat's mast on a canal outside the house. </p> <p>The house is the safe realm of bourgeois domesticity, which Friedrich aspired to and achieved; outside is the ship, an ominous presence, coming into town out of the German landscape.

      "body": "<p>Some of the most radical traffic control measures ever used in Britain may be tested on the M62 in a bid to prevent gridlock on a route vital to the economy of the north.</p> <p>The motorway, England's most northerly, runs from the outskirts of Liverpool to Humberside, crosses wild Pennine hill country and during blizzards is often the only east-west road link to remain open. New measures may include lanes reserved either for lorries or for vehicles with one or more passengers.</p> <p>The M62 now carries up to 190,000 vehicles a day on some of its busiest sections (compared with 225,000 on the M25) and drivers are plagued by long snarl-ups and unpredictable journey times.</p> <p>Forecasts show that traffic will increase by an average of 35% by 2010 and almost doubling on the busiest sections. Congestion around junctions 26 and 27 near Leeds and Bradford will increase from three hours a day to nine hours.</p> <p>If nothing is done, the average time for the 53-mile trip from the junction with the M6 west of Manchester to the M1 south of Leeds will rise from 1hr 31min to 1hr 55min.</p> <p>The journey from Liverpool to Hull would take 3hr 14min, making a mockery of the brave predictions made in a brochure published when the Queen opened the M62 in 1971: \"By the mid 1970s, the 100-mile journey from Liverpool to Hull will be cut from five exhausting hours to an easy cruise of less than two hours.\"</p> <p>Although ministers have done a u-turn on road-building, relief schemes for the M62 are unlikely after disastrous proposals for a new six-lane highway around north-west Manchester were abandoned in the mid-1990s.

      "bodyText": "Some of the most radical traffic control measures ever used in Britain may be tested on the M62 in a bid to prevent gridlock on a route vital to the economy of the north. The motorway, England's most northerly, runs from the outskirts of Liverpool to Humberside, crosses wild Pennine hill country and during blizzards is often the only east-west road link to remain open. New measures may include lanes reserved either for lorries or for vehicles with one or more passengers. The M62 now carries up to 190,000 vehicles a day on some of its busiest sections (compared with 225,000 on the M25) and drivers are plagued by long snarl-ups and unpredictable journey times. Forecasts show that traffic will increase by an average of 35% by 2010 and almost doubling on the busiest sections. Congestion around junctions 26 and 27 near Leeds and Bradford will increase from three hours a day to nine hours. If nothing is done, the average time for the 53-mile trip from the junction with the M6 west of Manchester to the M1 south of Leeds will rise from 1hr 31min to 1hr 55min. The journey from Liverpool to Hull would take 3hr 14min, making a mockery of the brave predictions made in a brochure published when the Queen opened the M62 in 1971: \"By the mid 1970s, the 100-mile journey from Liverpool to Hull will be cut from five exhausting hours to an easy cruise of less than two hours.\" Although ministers have done a u-turn on road-building, relief schemes for the M62 are unlikely after disastrous proposals for a new six-lane highway around north-west Manchester were abandoned in the mid-1990s. The plan blighted hundreds of homes. Neil Hewitt, the highways agency's area manager for the north-west, said: \"We are testing the water on how we manage traffic growth without major road improvements.\" Mr Hewitt and his team have outlined two possible lane segregation schemes, both of which would involve widening the motorway to four lanes on the most congested sections. Under one scheme, two lanes would be reserved for lorries; with the so-called HOV scheme (high occupancy vehicles), two lanes would be reserved for vehicles with two or more occupants (cars, buses, taxis). If HOV lanes - common in US cities - were introduced, a driver with one or more passengers could speed from Manchester to Leeds in 43 minutes in 2010, five minutes quicker than now. But drivers of other vehicles would find that their journeys took eight minutes longer. If lorry lanes were created, truckers could make the same trip in just 49 minutes in 2010. But other drivers, confined to just two lanes, would find that their journey time had increased to 72 minutes. A preliminary sift of consultation forms suggests a preference for lorry lanes - but that could mean more forms were completed by truckers than other drivers.",

Arthur de Sousa, 33, was last night described as being \"critical but stable\" after being hit by an automatic pistol in Pangbourne. But the wealthy businessman's bodyguard, Al El-Hachadi, 27, was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital after being shot several times in the stomach. Thames Valley police issued an all ports alert and warned the public to report sightings of a red Audi saloon, which was believed to contain the woman and two children, and a blue Range Rover seen speeding away from the scene of the shootings just after 9pm. Last night armed police swooped on a house in Reading and detained a 23-year-old man in connection with the shootings.

Nevertheless, the society eventually sent Henry Morton Stanley to find him, leading to the most famously stiff upper lip exchange in the history of exploration. The compass, together with Livingstone's sketches of the Victoria Falls and Stanley's notes and journals, is at the society in Kensington, London. Today the society will announce a \u00a36m lottery-backed project to open its archive of the history of exploration to the public for the first time. It was to this building, since the Royal Geographical Society was formed in 1830, that explorers and scientists, including Richard Burton, Lord Hunt, Edmund Hillary, Sherpa Tenzing, Wilfred Thesiger, Thor Heyerdahl, Chris Bonington and Ranulph Fiennes, came to report on their adventures. Scholars come from all over the world to consult the archive, which holds, at a conservative estimate, 2m maps, drawings, photographs, charts and books - and includes Livingstone's flat black cap which still bears the rips from a lion's claw, and 22,000 photographs of Mount Everest. The society also owns a magnificent 1486 atlas, which was owned by William Morris and influenced his recreation of medieval styles of typography and book illumination. It also has the pocket sextant which Charles Darwin took on the Beagle expedition. Ranulph Fiennes's polar sledge is in the basement and Captain Scott's sledge is on temporary loan to the South exhibition at the Maritime Museum. The development scheme, which is 75% lottery funded, will add an elegant light glass entrance, designed by Studio Downie, leading to new exhibition and reading room areas, 6 built under the remaining garden. Putting the card index catalogues and other material on the internet is as important to the project as the building. Rita Gardner, director of the society, said: \"We have been very aware of a responsibility to share this extraordinary collection with the public, but it has been impossible in the present building.\" The library also includes records of 1,000 years of exploration and adventure, including Captain Sharp's Journal over the Isthmus of Darien and Expedition into the South Seas written by himself, which begins: \"That which often spurs men on to the undertakings of the most difficult adventures is the sacred hunger of Gold; and 'twas Gold was the bait that tempted a Pack of merry boys of us, near Three Hundred in number.\" In April 1680, the \"merry boys\" were briefly distracted from their quest: \"The inhabitants for the most part are very handsome especially the Femail sex who are also exceeding loving and free to the embraces of Strangers.

      "bodyText": "With Queens Park Rangers sitting at the bottom of the table, being up for sale with no rush of takers and now finding themselves trying to find a new manager, the chant of \"One Gerry Francis\" that filled the stadium after only six minutes spoke volumes. Quite what the reaction would have been if QPR's director of football for the past 2 seasons had delivered another fifth-place Premiership finish, which he had in his first spell as recently as 1993, or even matched the runners-up spot they achieved in the old First Division as a player in 1975-76, is anybody's guess. But to mark his last appearance in the home dugout Francis's players rose to the occasion and produced only their fifth league win of the season, a result that lifted them out of the bottom three and left the majority to head home with very mixed emotions. \"It's been a very sad and an emotional day,\" said Francis, who announced on Friday that he will be taking a back seat for the rest of the season - but who has been offered a seat on the board in the summer and has been asked to stay on as director of football until then to assist with the academy and contractual matters. He will take the team for tomorrow's trip to Gillingham if a successor - Ian Holloway, who was in the director's box, and Graham Rix are the favourites - is not named in time. \"I've got 20-odd contracts up at the end of the season and I don't think I should be deciding on their futures and livelihoods as someone who's not going to be here,\" Francis said. \"This had to happen. Now is the time to bring players in too, certainly Bosmans, but how can I do that if I am not going to be around?\" QPR's most pressing problem right now is trying to stay in the First Division, if only to help smoke out a buyer for the owner Chris Wright and to allow the board to finalise a budget for next term. Safety is worth \u00a33m from the improved TV deal compared with the current \u00a3750,000, while for clubs in the Second Division the fee is \u00a31.4m, up from \u00a3350,000. It is a problem Barnsley are aware of, too, and after falling away here despite a bright opening their manager Nigel Spackman, five games in and still looking for a win, is already flirting with disaster. \"You mustn't lose games to teams who are around you in the table but the announcement about Gerry Francis was always going to have a knock-on effect on us,\" he said later.

People encourage one another, giving out genuine compliments and lending an ear to each other's difficulties. They like to share a good joke. No one is having an extramarital affair, because they have genuine integrity. You can practically see the energy flowing between the desks. </p> <p>Is this where you work? The odds are, it's not. Many people view their careers as an isolated operation, with colleagues seen for the most part as rivals. I once worked at a small company where three of the (married) directors were having affairs with the staff. The atmosphere was viperous and loaded with jealousy. And yet, strangely enough, people never flirted in the office. On the surface it was a cold, tense place to work, with lots of fake enthusiasm, while under the surface it festered. </p> <p>Peta Heskell, whose book The Flirt Coach has just been published, says flirting with integrity can not only enhance the atmosphere in the office, but also further one's career. Disguised under a garish pink cover, and peppered with heart-shaped bullet points, the book claims to be about the beauty of human interaction, describing how to \"put the fun and joie de vivre into communication to get success at work and relationships.\" It promises that \"flirting [can be] a way of life . . . for you. It is simply about feeling great about who you are and spreading it to other people, which makes them feel great too. When people feel great they are open to suggestions, opportunities and invitations. Their hearts, minds and support become available to you because you give genuine value to them.\" </p> <p>Heskell, a petite, bubbly woman, explains effusively that the key to flirting is to \"aim to make every place you work a place where people are really having a good time because you're around\". She advises me to list all the things I like about myself. If I find it difficult to think of good qualities, then I need to start learning to love myself, \"to start working on myself\". </p> <p>Flirting is titillating people and having them enjoy being with you, she maintains. Flirts tantalise and tease everyone, giving off signals of desirability and interest. Learn how to \"glow\" from inside, she says, and become a \"sunshiner\" - a positive, genuine person who faces challenges and notices possibilities in all situations. Then make eye contact, smile, and say hello. Give plenty of genuine compliments, and learn how to accept them gracefully and with thanks. </p> <p>According to Heskell, this is not a superficial thing, but a process that comes from \"giving out the fizz that everyone has inside them.\" It means \"being who you are and liking yourself, finding the best in yourself, the steel core that's really you so that on the outside you can be flexible and go with the flow.\" Once you begin to do that, she says, people are automatically drawn in. </p> <p>Somehow flirting has a slightly dubious image. An old friend of mine is a very strict French evangelical Protestant. She once said to me solemnly, \"I must try not to charm people.\" She genuinely considered flirting to be underhand, and tried to go through life in Paris without ever flirting with anyone - an admirable feat in a city where flirting is the currency of life. </p> <p>Heskell raves about the French. \"Flirting makes you feel good. The French have turned it into a fine art and a national pastime. What a shame the British haven't done the same. Over here we are so reserved that we have forgotten how to flirt.\" </p> <p>Some people deeply believe they cannot flirt, or that they are bad at it. Looking at me firmly, Heskell says: \"These are all self-imposed. We bad-mouth ourselves so much.\" </p> <p>She teaches people how to \"trigger their best flirting states\" by recalling a positive moment from their past. \"Your body changes as you imagine that moment, and you become more attractive,\" she says. </p> <p>However, in the current climate where even the mildest of personal compliments about a woman's looks can be construed as sexual harass ment, flirting can be like the 80s cult game of Mousetrap - you can go so far but after a certain point you are simply on the hell train. \"You have to learn to listen to yourself and to others and be aware of the effect your behaviour is having and gauge the mood of other,\" says Heskell. </p> <p>Alternatively, advises writer and consummate flirt, Dan Griffiths, \"Try noticing shoes and hair. It doesn't suggest that you're coming on to them, but it does say you are interested and plugged in because you noticed.\" </p> <p>Clarity is crucial for Heskell. \"There are too many women who say yes when they mean no.\" If you overdo the flirting, then you may well end up with your own personal stalker. It's important not to flirt with someone who could get the wrong idea. Remember that some people can be easily misled, so be careful how you behave with them. The best strategy is to flirt with everyone, indiscriminately, and then no one can take it the wrong way. </p> <p>Heskell tells the story of a married man who came to her for counselling. After some weeks he announced that he had fallen in love with his colleague. \"I told him to take back that energy to his wife and sort out the relationship. Instead he wrote the colleague a love letter, left his wife and moved in with her in a week. People won't be told.\" </p> <p>The idea of being nice to your colleagues is hardly revolutionary, but I really don't think I could go through life flirting relentlessly with everyone I meet - it sounds exhaustingly superficial. Nevertheless, Heskell does have a knack of opening doors and helping people to interact in a more positive and less restrained way. So, if you can overlook the little heart-shaped bullet points and the psychobabble, not to mention the exhortation to \"love yourself\" through masturbation, I would recommend that you have a look at The Flirt Coach. It might just improve the atmosphere in the office - and we all need a little of that. </p> <p><strong>10 ways to a more flirtatious you</strong></p> <p><strong> 1)</strong> Seek out \"sunshiners\" and stay way from \"black-clouders\". Surround yourself with things that make you feel good, like quotes and pictures that motivate you. Post them on your walls and use them as a screensaver. </p> <p><strong> 2)</strong> Are you laughing enough? Watch TV programmes and read books that make you laugh. Subscribe to a daily joke list. </p> <p><strong> 3)</strong> Whenever you stand in front of the mirror ask yourself: \"What's true of me when I am at my best? What am I like when I'm being the word that best describes me?\" Aim for that emotion/feeling. </p> <p><strong> 4)</strong> Ask yourself the following questions when you wake up each morning: What am I happy about in my life? What am I excited about in my life? What am I proud about in my life? What am I grateful about in my life? Who do I love? Who loves me? </p> <p><strong> 5)</strong> As you go about your business, take in the world through each individual sense. Notice the different information that becomes available . </p> <p><strong> 6)</strong> Choose the animal that is your symbol. Learn all about that animal and discover which of its qualities you need. </p> <p><strong> 7) </strong> Decide that each day you will do something in a different way. </p> <p><strong> 8)</strong> Every day write down three pages of whatever comes into your head. This will open you up to recognition of what you have learned and to new ideas. </p> <p><strong> 9)</strong> Start smiling at strangers.

Joe Jackson, who claimed to have retired from pop music in the 1990s, has a reputation for putting on good shows, hiring the best musicians, giving good value and playing smart new arrangements of his old hits. That's exactly what he did - playing for nearly two and a half hours with encores. He has always been one of the most musicianly of pop singer-bandleaders: unlike many of his peers in the late 1970s, he seemed to arrive with a fully developed musical language. He's more like a composer who writes his own libretto than a songwriter who sticks lyrics over chords and riffs. Each song's melodic figures, rhythms, structures and words are woven into a coherent whole, with the result that you can often identify a Joe Jackson song from just a couple of chords or a drumbeat. </p> <p>For the current tour he extended the style of one of his most successful and enduring albums for a new set of Broadway lullabies and nightmare vignettes. The original Night and Day used a Latin American backline crowned by acoustic piano and overdubbed keyboards. Whatever the tempo or subject-matter the rhythm section remained rock steady. For this tour, to promote his new album Night and Day II, Jackson employed the brilliant Sue Hadjopoulos (percussion) and old friend Graham Maby (bass) from the earlier album, plus the great Roberto Rodriguez (who drummed with Marc Ribot's Prosthetic Cubans at the Jazz Cafe last June). Jackson's arrangements were fleshed out by Andy Ezrin (keyboards) with cellist Catherine Bent and Allison Cornell (violin and keyboards), who also took the lead vocal for Glamour and Pain. </p> <p>Starting with Prelude's looped hi-hats and solo spotlit cello, then crashing into Hell of a Town, the band began to explore the leader's large back catalogue with songs such as Fools in Love and Another World. A confident reinvention of Becker and Fagen's Reeling in the Years threw the band's many qualities into sharp relief. For Breaking Us in Two, Cornell played a trill-perfect transcription of the original synth solo. </p> <p>The second set began with four solo numbers, including It's Different For Girls and the Beatles' For No One. Then came Jackson's \"seven-minute opera\", Love Got Lost, sung by Marianne Faithfull on his recording, but here given a tender and grandiose rendition by the man himself. In a dramatic version of Real Men the angry final verse was accompanied by the three women musicians - just strings, percussion and Joe. Energy levels continued to rise, with Mahavishnu-like flourishes for Target and neurotic Steve Reich-ish strings for Just Because ... until the set ended with Stay, a new song coupled with the old hit Stepping Out. After a frenetic encore number they closed with Slow Song - bass and treble in perfect harmony. </p> <p>\u0095 Joe Jackson plays the Symphony Hall, Birmingham, tonight, the Apollo, Manchester, tomorrow, the Royal Concert Hall, Glasgow, on Wednesday, then tours.

The work itself, however, remains a puzzle, and has provoked considerable diversity of approach. Written in 1840, it ostensibly formed Schumann's wedding gift to his wife, though lurking beneath the surface of its 26 songs is a disparity between subject and intent. The tone is often dark. A wide spectrum of sexual experience is examined, from marital consummation and gay desire to sibling incest. There is also a divergence of opinion as to whether it forms an integrated whole. Is it a genuine song cycle, dependent for its impact on jolting emotional and stylistic contrast rather than linear narrative? Or is it simply an arbitrarily assembled collection? </p> <p>Christiane Oelze and Wolfgang Holzmair seemingly took the latter view on this occasion, plonking an interval in the middle of it, which seriously weakened its cumulative effect. They also proved an oddly ill-matched pair. Holzmair's voice has thickened a bit of late. His once velvety tone has now become a tangy, opulent bronze, though he has also mercifully lost his old habit of occasionally sacrificing pitch for verbal nuance. Sound, sense and line are now immaculately welded in his singing. The words bite. Each song is sharply characterised. Aus Den Hebr\u00e4ischen Ges\u00e4ngen has a rapt, mystic flow. He turns the seducer of the Venetian songs into a world-weary rou\u00e9. The final invocation to \"my sister, my bride\" is urgently sexual, though he tried to duck the homoerotic implications of Aus Den Schenkenbuch by portraying its narrator as an out-of-control drunk. </p> <p>Oelze is markedly different. Her voice has an easy, silvery shimmer, appealing in itself, but placing her next to Holzmair reveals an absence of subtlety. There's an emotional sameness in her singing and a chastity of utterance that sits uneasily with the innuendo and eroticism in the texts: you miss the seditious undertones of the Highland Lullaby; her Bride, hankering after physical pleasure before the wedding, seems merely coy. </p> <p>Myrthen was flanked by two sets of Schumann's vocal duets - gorgeous works that still seem avant-garde. The chromatic probings of the Lullaby at the Bedside of a Sick Child, for instance, are years ahead of their time. Schumann's fondness, however, for pitting the upper extremes of the baritone voice against the lower registers of the soprano can lead to problems of balance, and even though Holzmair scaled his tone down, there were moments when he almost swamped Oelze completely. The pianist, Roger Vignoles, is one of the finest of all Schumann accompanists, playing with emotional density and limpidity throughout.</p>",

But, it says, \"a handful of centres becoming staff-friendly isn't good enough.

      "body": "<p>The past 12 months have seen some interesting shifts in the ranks of the Royal Ballet, with an influx of talent that has been altering our perception of who will be leading the company in the next decade. One of the first new arrivals was Alina Cojocaru, a Romanian dancer who had spent six months in the Royal Ballet School, moved to Kiev Ballet to dance principal roles, then applied to join the Royal. Hardly anyone noted her arrival in the corps de ballet until she suddenly appeared in the lead role of Symphonic Variations - replacing an injured dancer at short notice. </p> <p>She was startlingly good, displaying an instinct for the music and stillness of the choreography that belied her 18 years. Subsequent performances of Clara in The Nutcracker confirmed she was a force to be reckoned with. Then, to add a touch of instant glamour, Cojocaru made an unscheduled debut as Juliet this Saturday, learning the role in eight days after the advertised Leanne Benjamin sustained an injury. </p> <p>This came straight after Tamara Rojo, another outsider, made her own debut in the same role. Rojo, 26, is less of an unknown - she was a principal with English National Ballet before transferring to the Royal this season. But the timing is still delicious. The two women tipped to become the Royal's next-generation ballerinas have both taken on one of the company's most prized roles within the same week. </p> <p>Rojo's debut was entirely engrossing. Her opening scenes play Juliet as a very sweet, naive child and, while there are moments when she verges on the cute, these are cancelled by glimpses of a visceral intensity. During the Capulet ball Rojo's Juliet darts confused glances down at Paris's hands as he partners her - trying to follow his lead but also resenting his touch. This man doesn't feel right to her but she doesn't yet know why. When she first meets Romeo she's girlish still, yet with heady rushes of energy that prefigure her capacity to gamble everything for love. </p> <p>And Rojo steadily intensifies this energy throughout. She is unlucky in having Inaki Urlezaga as her Romeo - a good dancer but a limited actor - and their pas de deux don't generate real heat. Rojo's own dancing, however, gets more sweeping and dangerous in its phrasing and her instincts more naked and fierce. She peels away layers of prettiness and in the final death scene her grief is a silent howl, wrenched so painfully from her guts that it shatters the air. </p> <p>Given Cojocaru's limited rehearsal time it is not surprising that her Juliet is less dramatically articulate - never quite travelling the full distance from virginal modesty to tragedy. But that barely matters given the drama of her dancing. Cojocaru may be tiny but her body encompasses a huge range - a luxuriant adagio that seems to stretch a phrase into white space, an allegro so light she skims the stage and a dazzling variety of nuances in between. By the end we're weeping, less for Juliet's fate than for the thrill that Cojocaru, being this good at 19, is going to be extraordinary at 30. </p> <p>Her Romeo on Saturday was Johan Kobborg. He too started out with a conventional reading of the role, but became mesmerising in acts two and three - his dancing and acting both registering the anguish of a heart and intelligence trapped by fate. Ricardo Cervera as Mercutio performed one of the most credible death scenes I've seen in ages, agony that made us flinch, and Luke Heydon was a fine Tybalt handling his sword with the kind of brute purpose that made you believe he was a grim familiar of death. </p> <p>\u0095 In repertory until April 18.

This broad listening is shown through the variety of line-ups he has used, but also through his improvisation at the piano. At the Barbican, this was best heard when the 15-piece band dropped back to a quartet with Mark Mondesir (drums), Bosco D'Oliveira (percussion) and Alec Dankworth (bass). It's not just a case of left-hand accompaniment, right-hand tune with Tyner. He wades in with both at the lower end of the keyboard, creating rich clusters that somehow don't become muddy and unclear - partly because of his sensitivity to dynamics and balance. He is famed for his power, but that is partly because he knows how to frame dramatic explosions with lightness of touch. And that drumming-like approach to the keyboard is always ready to burst free, one hand darting to the top of the keyboard and trickling down, dazzlingly, before feeding back into the chords chugging away below. </p> <p>In the middle of the first set, he pushed this sound effortlessly, in a solo number, through more traditional piano styles (such as stride) right through to a bracing modal ending with an impressionistic, almost classical close. In the bold funky numbers this approach worked: there was an elemental excitement - a kind of smooth power - that made you feel you could take on the world. </p> <p>Mondesir's drumming, constantly filling and flirting with the beat (more like rhythm than beating) helped the sound have weight without becoming bogged down. There were great opportunities to hear different musical characters at work during the solos though sadly not from the tuba (Andy Grappy) or French horn (Jim Ratigan). There was squealing showmanship from Claude Deppa (trumpet); focused melodic bass from Dankworth; Andy Sheppard's trademark honk; and Jason Yarde's richly influenced ideas. </p> <p>The trouble was that often the group sounded like a collection of individuals rather than a band, and there were quite bad lapses of ensemble in the less strident moments. \"If the music's working,\" Tyner once said, \"then in a way the players love each other. Maybe not always off the bandstand, but in the music itself\". It didn't feel like that was always the case here. That's one of the problems of the all-star big band, which gets together only occasionally, perhaps with limited rehearsal time.

Economists usually leave questions about value to others - if someone is prepared to pay \u00a31m for his works, then the market has determined that that is its worth.
