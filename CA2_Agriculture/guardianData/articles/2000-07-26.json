      "byline": "Matthew Engel",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Cricket clubs throughout the country have just received a little brochure from Lord's, entitled Clean Bowl Racism. It contains 17 policies and 28 action plans which the England and Wales Cricket Board wants introduced to further racial equality in cricket. </p> <p>Most of these suggestions are pious, unobjectionable and cheap (Policy 3 (iv): Season and match-day tickets to bear an anti-racism statement). Unfortunately, the one significant move the ECB could have made to encourage new spectators into cricket grounds - holding back a few tickets for sale on the day, Wimbledon-style - was rejected. As the brochure explains with unusual frankness, \"commercial considerations\" were considered more important. </p> <p>None the less, the board has made its views clear (Policy 6: ECB to introduce and implement regulations to eliminate racist comments and actions, with appropriate penalties) - but not clear, apparently, to everyone. </p> <p>The Bradford League is at the very heart of English cricket. Its geography also places it in one of cricket's most racially sensitive areas. But first and foremost it is the most traditional, the toughest and arguably the best league in Yorkshire. </p> <p>Even in the second-team second division, the cricket is rarely of the jolly-good-show-and-let's-have-a- cucumber-sandwich variety. This goes particularly for matches between Idle II and Lightcliffe II. It was against this background that one of the Idle players last month allegedly called a Lightcliffe batsman both \"a black bastard\" and \"a black cunt\". </p> <p>The batsman, Tony Bowry, originally from St Kitts, had been given not out after an appeal for caught behind. The Idle captain, Paul Wiseman, did not hear the remarks but admits that one of his team-mates has told him these words were used. The square-leg umpire, Tom Priestley, also apparently heard them, but chose to take no action. He said later he had dealt with the situation on the field. </p> <p>All this incensed the Lightcliffe captain, Bob Furness, who afterwards told Priestley what he thought of him. \"The red mist came down, I admit it,\" said Furness. \"I might have said he was fucking useless, but I'm sticking my hand up to that, and I told him to get out of our dressing room.\" </p> <p>Priestley reported Furness to the league, and he is now banned for a month for verbally abusing an official. Nothing else from this match was reported, and no one else has been punished. It is germane at this point to mention Furness's profession: he is a constable in the West Yorkshire police, a body which more than most has had to confront allegations of racism. </p> <p>Furness is still incensed, and wrote to Wisden. The case is interesting because the Bradford League's attitudes have come under scrutiny before. No one suggests the league is inherently racist, and many of the teams are increasingly integrated. But there is a strong smack of that unthinking set of attitudes known as \"institutionalised racism\". Asian players have complained before that they find clubs unwelcoming, and there remains considerable mutual suspicion. </p> <p>I have had the strong impression over the years that league officials are simply bored by the subject, and they appear not to have changed. Normally, the league puts out press releases announcing disciplinary findings; this time it did not. \"We didn't consider it of much interest,\" said Graham Reid, the chairman. </p> <p>\"We do not condone any sledging or verbal abuse irrespective of racism,\" he said. \"What was said on the field was not reported, so we can't take any action. The umpire said he never considered it a racial matter. Whatever was said doesn't justify what Mr Furness did.\" </p> <p>Reid says the Bradford League has not yet formulated a policy on racial abuse as such; it has not received the ECB document, which has apparently gone to clubs and not leagues. However, incidents such as this go beyond cricketing policy and touch the borders of what might, under the last Criminal Justice Act, now be construed as a criminal offence. </p> <p>Furness says the disciplinary panel asked: \"Don't you think you're going over the top with this racism thing?\" </p> <p>\"There's sledging and there's personal,\" he says, \"and there's a line you don't go over. I'm 43 and I came up before a lot of white males, most of them old enough to be my father, all mates together. Do they want us to go on to the field and start arresting people, or is the league going to deal with it?\" </p> <p> Throughout Yorkshire cricket there are people working like crazy to build racial harmony, with considerable success. But I sense that there are still people in authority who have not yet got the message. </p> <p>The Headingley Test, with its history of racial unpleasantness, is coming up next month. After that, they will be getting rid of the awful Western Terrace; perhaps they could also demolish the last of the attitudes it represents.</p>",

None the less, the board has made its views clear (Policy 6: ECB to introduce and implement regulations to eliminate racist comments and actions, with appropriate penalties) - but not clear, apparently, to everyone. The Bradford League is at the very heart of English cricket. Its geography also places it in one of cricket's most racially sensitive areas. But first and foremost it is the most traditional, the toughest and arguably the best league in Yorkshire. Even in the second-team second division, the cricket is rarely of the jolly-good-show-and-let's-have-a- cucumber-sandwich variety. This goes particularly for matches between Idle II and Lightcliffe II. It was against this background that one of the Idle players last month allegedly called a Lightcliffe batsman both \"a black bastard\" and \"a black cunt\". The batsman, Tony Bowry, originally from St Kitts, had been given not out after an appeal for caught behind. The Idle captain, Paul Wiseman, did not hear the remarks but admits that one of his team-mates has told him these words were used. The square-leg umpire, Tom Priestley, also apparently heard them, but chose to take no action. He said later he had dealt with the situation on the field. All this incensed the Lightcliffe captain, Bob Furness, who afterwards told Priestley what he thought of him. \"The red mist came down, I admit it,\" said Furness. \"I might have said he was fucking useless, but I'm sticking my hand up to that, and I told him to get out of our dressing room.\" Priestley reported Furness to the league, and he is now banned for a month for verbally abusing an official. Nothing else from this match was reported, and no one else has been punished. It is germane at this point to mention Furness's profession: he is a constable in the West Yorkshire police, a body which more than most has had to confront allegations of racism. Furness is still incensed, and wrote to Wisden. The case is interesting because the Bradford League's attitudes have come under scrutiny before. No one suggests the league is inherently racist, and many of the teams are increasingly integrated. But there is a strong smack of that unthinking set of attitudes known as \"institutionalised racism\". Asian players have complained before that they find clubs unwelcoming, and there remains considerable mutual suspicion. I have had the strong impression over the years that league officials are simply bored by the subject, and they appear not to have changed. Normally, the league puts out press releases announcing disciplinary findings; this time it did not. \"We didn't consider it of much interest,\" said Graham Reid, the chairman. \"We do not condone any sledging or verbal abuse irrespective of racism,\" he said. \"What was said on the field was not reported, so we can't take any action. The umpire said he never considered it a racial matter. Whatever was said doesn't justify what Mr Furness did.\" Reid says the Bradford League has not yet formulated a policy on racial abuse as such; it has not received the ECB document, which has apparently gone to clubs and not leagues. However, incidents such as this go beyond cricketing policy and touch the borders of what might, under the last Criminal Justice Act, now be construed as a criminal offence. Furness says the disciplinary panel asked: \"Don't you think you're going over the top with this racism thing?\" \"There's sledging and there's personal,\" he says, \"and there's a line you don't go over. I'm 43 and I came up before a lot of white males, most of them old enough to be my father, all mates together. Do they want us to go on to the field and start arresting people, or is the league going to deal with it?\" Throughout Yorkshire cricket there are people working like crazy to build racial harmony, with considerable success. But I sense that there are still people in authority who have not yet got the message. The Headingley Test, with its history of racial unpleasantness, is coming up next month. After that, they will be getting rid of the awful Western Terrace; perhaps they could also demolish the last of the attitudes it represents.",

They have played each other 104 times and are level pegging with 37 wins each. Brazil (probable): Dida; Evanilson, Antonio Carlos, Roque Junior, Roberto Carlos, Emerson, Vampeta, Ze Roberto, Alex, Ronaldinho, Rivaldo. Argentina (probable): Bonano; Ayala, Sensini, Samuel, Zanetti, Simeone, Veron, Kily Gonzalez, Ortega, Claudio Lopez, Crespo.

The framework will set out how to establish a local \"compact\", or agreed way of working, and it represents a development of the national compact between government and the voluntary sector, launched in 1998. </p> <p>Adam Gaines, director of public affairs at the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO), says that as 70% of voluntary activity takes place at a local level, the guidelines will be a way of putting local partnerships on a formal footing. Hilary Armstrong, local government minister, asserts: \"Local compacts will help create the conditions for healthy partnerships between local government and the voluntary and community sectors, based on shared values and mutual respect.\" </p> <p>But critics say the guidelines are absurdly late, as many local voluntary agencies have already developed compacts. Carole Howells, director of Newcastle-upon-Tyne Council for Voluntary Services (CVS) says: \"Any CVS worth its salt has done this already; the guidelines would have been helpful a year ago.\" </p> <p>The guidelines could well have proved useful in Newcastle's case, as they will stress the importance of involving local councillors throughout the compact process. Newcastle CVS wrote its compact in consultation only with the voluntary and community sector, and then passed it to the local authority. It is still waiting for the authority to sign up to it. </p> <p>Howells claims it is not easy to reach agreement within the voluntary and community sector and argues: \"It is best to get your side to agree before going to the other side.\" Paul Barasi, compact development officer at the NCVO, says compacts are all about building relationships. \"We know how much time one-to-one relationships take to establish, so those between a number of organisations are bound to be more complicated.\" </p> <p>Barasi explains that it has taken a year for the guidelines to be published because of extensive consultation. \"This is the first time we have had a joint steering group of this nature to produce something which enables local people to take things forward,\" he says. </p> <p>In keeping with the theme of relationships, the guidelines are being published jointly by the voluntary and community sector's working group on government relations and the Local Government Association. Carol Clinton, policy officer at the association, says the document was circulated to local authorities for comment and has been refined as a result. It should now be a useful tool to review compacts that are already in train. \"Having a compact is not about having a document which sits on a shelf; it is about an ongoing and developing relationship.\" </p> <p>Barasi is particularly encouraged by the participation of local government in drawing up the detail of the guidelines. He refers to section 3.22 which says that when making funding decisions, government departments may take into account whether there is an effective local compact. \"This could result in a colossal shift in goodies to the sector,\" he claims. </p> <p>Appendix 1 of the document sets out the basic elements of a compact, including a government undertaking to give three months' notice of funding decisions and allowing 12 weeks for consultation. And under a section entitled \"partnerships and joint working\", the document states: \"The voluntary and community sector is now seen as local government's key partner in an era where partnership is increasingly becoming the working pattern for public authorities.\" </p> <p>However the section goes on to acknowledge: \"Within local government, it is now generally felt that a real shift in culture is needed for local authorities to understand and accept the voluntary and community sector's role.\" </p> <p>Lis Pritchard, director of the National Association of Councils for Voluntary Service, says the next year will be a telling time for compacts. \"Compacts may say the right things, but what will happen if one side doesn't comply?\" She claims this is an issue at both national and local level. \"So far the experience has been mixed, there is varied awareness of compacts and in some areas they haven't heard of them.\" </p> <p>Hilary Russell, deputy director of the European Institute for Urban Affairs at Liverpool's John Moores University, was on the Deakin commission into the future of the voluntary sector in 1996, which first floated the concept of compacts. She says the idea reflects the shifting ground in society in the past 20 years. \"There has been a redrawing of boundaries between the state, market place and third sector. Hopefully local compacts will boost awareness of the contribution of the voluntary sector to the economy.\" </p> <p>However, there are dilemmas. Russell says: \"As opportunities for funding and contracting with the public sector are growing, we don't want to see the voluntary sector becoming so colonised that it loses its cutting edge and capacity to criticise.\"</p> <p>\u0095 The Local Compact Guidelines will be launched tomorrow by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions.

And under a section entitled \"partnerships and joint working\", the document states: \"The voluntary and community sector is now seen as local government's key partner in an era where partnership is increasingly becoming the working pattern for public authorities.\" However the section goes on to acknowledge: \"Within local government, it is now generally felt that a real shift in culture is needed for local authorities to understand and accept the voluntary and community sector's role.\" Lis Pritchard, director of the National Association of Councils for Voluntary Service, says the next year will be a telling time for compacts. \"Compacts may say the right things, but what will happen if one side doesn't comply?\" She claims this is an issue at both national and local level. \"So far the experience has been mixed, there is varied awareness of compacts and in some areas they haven't heard of them.\" Hilary Russell, deputy director of the European Institute for Urban Affairs at Liverpool's John Moores University, was on the Deakin commission into the future of the voluntary sector in 1996, which first floated the concept of compacts. She says the idea reflects the shifting ground in society in the past 20 years. \"There has been a redrawing of boundaries between the state, market place and third sector. Hopefully local compacts will boost awareness of the contribution of the voluntary sector to the economy.\" However, there are dilemmas. Russell says: \"As opportunities for funding and contracting with the public sector are growing, we don't want to see the voluntary sector becoming so colonised that it loses its cutting edge and capacity to criticise.\" \u0095 The Local Compact Guidelines will be launched tomorrow by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions.

On Monday Mr Justice Hooper discharged the jury when it failed to reach a verdict on retired chief superintendent David Duckenfield, of Torquay, Devon, the match commander on the day, who also faced two manslaughter charges. During the trial, the families heard the familiar arguments about what happened during what the prosecution described as \"eight calamitous minutes on a wonderful sunny spring day\" when Liverpool were due to play Nottingham Forest in an FA cup semi-final. The families had heard those events described many times before: during Lord Taylor's inquiry, which reported in 1990, and again during the inquest in 1991: it lasted 80 days and was the longest in British legal history. On Tuesday July 18, after hearing 20 days of evidence, the jury of four women and eight men retired to consider their verdicts and the families could do nothing but wait.

And even when it does it's often more hassle than it's worth, with those members wearing sensory deprivation suits getting lost around Lancaster Gate, and others being refused entrance to the meeting by their dominatrix until they eat some raw chicken. However there's nothing that quite brings the committee together like a new set of stringent punishment guidelines, and so it has proved again today.</p> <p>From the beginning of the new season, anyone who manhandles a referee will receive at least, that's at least, a 12 match suspension. If they do it again, they'll be banned for a year. Any Premiership club involved in a mass confrontation, whether with officials or the opposition, faces a fine of \u00a3250,000. Any club with six bookings or more in a game faces a fine of \u00a325,000 (both sets of fines will be scaled down for lower leagues). All sneaky offences will be liable to be punished by video evidence, to be monitored by a new advisory panel. And finally, anyone who flobs during a match is liable to be flogged.</p> <p>It may seem harsh to you, but it sure tastes good to the FA's new chief executive, Adam Crozier. \"The new disciplinary system provides the clarity, consistency and transparency that everyone in the game demands,\" he rejoiced this afternoon. \"It is designed to be hard but fair in the way that it treats every player, club and manager in the same way. We all hope that it contributes to improving standards of behaviour throughout the game.\" So does the Fiver, and we're sure the boys and girls in discipline will agree.

      "bodyText": "In her valedictory speech to Parliament today, Betty Boothroyd spoke of her pride and enjoyment in her eight-year role as speaker of the House of Commons. But she warned that the key role of parliament, that of legislative and executive scrutiny, must be upheld. Giving her retirement speech after prime minister's question time this afternoon, she said: \"Being speaker has afforded me a unique opportunity to serve parliament, for which I am immensely grateful.\" She added; \"The function of parliament is to hold the executive to account. We should never overlook the primacy of parliament.\" She went on to express disappointment at what she termed \"slow progress\" in the development of question time, and described legislative scrutiny as \"an area ripe for improvement\". The speaker added: \"The high reputation of Westminster abroad is not entirely reflected at home.\" She spoke of increasing political disillusionment and cynicism amongst the public, especially the young. \"Their alienation from the democratic process is troubling,\" she commented. She ended by urging members to rejoice in their inheritance: \"Defend your rights, and remember that the privilege of this house was dearly won.\" In spite of calls in parliament yesterday for her to defer her retirement until a successor is elected, Ms Boothroyd will step down as speaker and as MP for West Bromwich West before the Commons returns from its summer recess in October, as she announced in parliament on July 12. As parliament's first female speaker, she has served since 1992. In the Commons yesterday Tam Dalyell, MP for Linlithgow, raised concerns over the election procedure. He called for Ms Boothroyd to postpone her departure until November to help MPs elect her successor to \"enable the House to make up its mind in a sensible fashion\". With at least a dozen candidates in the running for the post, the election, which will be held in a free vote on the opening of parliament after the summer recess, looks wide open. Although tradition dictates that the chair should alternate between Conservatives and Labour, it is expected that a Labour or Liberal Democrat MP will win the vote. Rumoured to enjoy the support of the prime minister, Tony Blair, Liberal Democrat veteran Menzies Campbell may be a favourite. If elected, Mr Campbell would be the first Liberal speaker since 1924.",

Then David Ripley, who had been batting with a runner, fell for 33 (fair enough). Michael Strong followed first ball (mild irritation), and Darren Cousins was stumped for 0 (angry cursing). In the next over Tony Penberthy was caught for 57 (tears of rage). The last four wickets had fallen without addition and Glamorgan needed 309.

Since then they've underperformed horribly. </p> <p> The curse is continuing. The captain Matthew Hayden, one of seven Australian left-handers on the county circuit, has passed 30 on 17 occasions in all competitions. Only once has he gone on to make a century.

Two years ago he was voted cricketer of the year by his fellow professionals, and he began last season as next in line for an England spot. He duly had a shocker (302 Championship runs at 16.77) and everyone agreed he wasn't strong enough mentally. This year he's shown an alarming tendency to get off to a flyer before throwing it away. David Sales has been even more annoying. He either gets in and stays in or doesn't get in at all: either side of his 276 against Notts were scores of 0, 5, 1, 25, 3, then 30, 1, 2, 2, and 18.</p> <p> Penberthy is dependable but dour and Swann can't be trusted to make the most of a good start. The only unqualified success has been the Sydney-born but English-qualified Jeff Cook, who hit <a href=\"http://www.wisden.com/Story_Co_Brand/0,5642,344262,00.html\">137 at Cheltenham recently</a>, yet he's only played three Championship games. It all adds up to a worrying lack of stability at the top of the order. So far, so Northants.</p> <p> The bowling has been even more infuriating.

Verdict: No Dorit Braun Chief executive of Parentline Plus helpline for parents Many parents who contact us work and find it hard to balance the needs of their children, themselves and their partner. But when you talk the issues through, it often becomes clear that the idea of not working simply isn't financially feasible, and work also gives them a life of their own, which they both want and need.

Verdict: No John Coe Spokesman, the National Association for Primary Education From an educational point of view you see huge benefits from quality time with parents, which includes trips to museums and days out. As teachers, we often find that children with problems are insecure, which may come from not having had enough regularity and continuity in their lives. By adolescence a child inevitably breaks away from his or her parents, and at that point it's crucial that the child has had both quality of care and quantity of care from their parents if they're to survive the turbulence. Verdict: They need both Jan Parker Co-author of Raising Happy Children (Hodder &amp; Stoughton) This is a complicated debate - it's not as simple as quality time, bad; at-home parents, good. Of course working long hours isn't good for family life, and of course children and their parents benefit hugely from time spent together. But our country still has the longest working hours in Europe, and you can't chastise British parents without taking account of that.

Keeping later nights, she seems to be surviving on little sleep and is generally vague and irritable when you ask her how things are. You can't be sure, but hasn't your 15-year-old son lost a little weight recently? Not wolfing down the food with quite his customary gusto? Aren't you worried? </p> <p>Judging by the alarm bells ringing at Surescreen Diagnostics Ltd, your child could actually be a walking, mumbling repository for any number of drugs doing the rounds in the pubs and clubs where he spends so much time losing himself. Between 40% and 50% of young people in Britain today have tried one substance or another, so who knows? But don't panic; Surescreen has the answer: if you can get your recalcitrant teenager to give you a urine sample before he crawls into bed, the Derby firm's home drug-screening kit will do the rest. </p> <p>Currently obtainable by mail order and due to be marketed nationally in the next few weeks by a chain of major chemists, the At Home Drug Test is the first screening kit in the UK that has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Costing \u00a324.99, the one-use kit offers a 99% accurate test for amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy and heroin. Surescreen's principal scientific officer, Jim Campbell, insists that the test has a beneficial role to play for both parents and children. </p> <p>\"Whether referred to us by their GP or an NHS trust treatment centre, an increasing number of anxious parents have contacted us over the last two years to buy the test. There is a very real demand.\" </p> <p>The kit comprises a urine cup, gloves, an instruction manual and five test strips. Once armed with your urine sample (this one will surely stump most parents) you dip the test strips into it; if you get a positive result you then send the strips and urine to Surescreen, who will run further tests to determine which drug has been used. The presence of prescription drugs won't trigger an inaccurately positive reading. </p> <p>\"When the parent rings us for the results, the interpretations of a positive result, in terms of the drug's effects and its health risks, are discussed,\" says Campbell. Simple. </p> <p>However, many drugs experts are sceptical about the benefits of the kits. Home testing can establish whether a drug has or has not been recently taken, but it cannot determine previous or future use. And the effects on the parent-child relationship, they say, could be devastating. </p> <p>\"I'll give you a gold clock if you can show me a relationship between a 15-year-old and a parent where such testing would help,\" says Gerv McGrath, director of Addaction, a drug counselling group in Derby. The kit, he says, is simply a cynical exploitation of parents which has no therapeutic value in the home. </p> <p>\"It's not conducted in an informed way by the parent as it doesn't recognise that alcohol is the main entry point to drug abuse. The test can't show this. And how could a parent possibly use it in a trusting relationship? Working from the position that says, 'I don't trust you,' it has no benefit whatsoever. It certainly won't help a difficult relationship.\" </p> <p>What's more, he adds: \"If the test is negative, it doesn't tell you much. Your child might not have been using drugs today or last week, but what about three months ago or next year?\" </p> <p>McGrath advises worried parents to spend the \u00a325 on taking the child out for a meal and talking things through. \"Testing won't prevent drug abuse and is a complete waste of time and money. And how parents with three or four children are expected to shell out for it is anyone's guess.\" </p> <p>Dr Harry Markantonakis, a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist at West Bromwich's Edward Street hospital, insists that trust has been broken once a child tries drugs. But while he would consider using the test on his own children, he is also aware of the risks he would be running. </p> <p>\"If a parent were to suddenly ask a child to take the test, without any prior dialogue, that would be very wrong. Otherwise, how you do it is crucial, but in good relationships I'm not convinced that it would always necessarily cause conflict. </p> <p>\"But a parent could overreact to symptoms that are typical in teenagers. Seeing your daughter flushed and bleary-eyed on occasions is nothing to worry about, and if you're asking me if that represents a case for this test, I'd say forget it.\"</p>",

They seem to be of two completely different people. </p> <p>I was extremely healthy throughout my pregnancy. Complications could not have been further from my mind. Like Cherie, I too had three older children, two boys and a girl, and this, my fourth baby, was a lovely surprise, coming seven years after our youngest son. The fact that according to my notes I was of advanced maternal age seemed insignificant. I had always given birth swiftly and easily. </p> <p>My consultant at the hospital had recommended that I should be induced there so as not to run the risk of giving birth precipitately, at home or elsewhere. And so I was induced, albeit reluctantly, at the Chelsea and Westminster hospital on October 2 1996, a week before she was due, though she was not \"engaged\". </p> <p>I was put on a syntocin drip and wired up to a monitor. Just after midnight, when I was close to giving birth, the monitor registered acute foetal distress. It was decided that I needed to deliver the baby quickly but it became apparent that she was facing the wrong way, possibly as a consequence of the induction process. A decision was made not to use forceps, but to go for an emergency caesarean section. When she was finally delivered she had suffered massive brain damage due to asphyxia contracted in that period. </p> <p>Up until the moment of birth I was unaware of the true gravity of the situation, but as soon as she was born I knew something was terribly wrong. She was limp and silent. I had never realised how tuned a mother is to the cry of her newborn. \"Why doesn't she cry?\" I called out in panic. \"Oh God, please not brain damage,\" but no one was prepared to commit themselves to anything more than that she was poorly. I wanted to hold her and see her but instead I was wheeled back to the labour ward and left there for seven hours with the eerie sounds of women giving birth in the twilight hours and the terrible feeling that I had failed to do what other women all around were able to do. </p> <p>As dawn rose over London we stared out of the window in utter desolation. In a brusque fashion the midwife came back to ask after my \"wound\". No mention of my baby. I looked at her strangely. The pain in my abdomen from an emergency caesarean was as nothing to the real wound in my heart. </p> <p>She died a week later. I found it unbearable to give her up to be taken from my arms to the cold mortuary. We took her away to be buried in the Devon countryside. Milk was pouring from my breasts at the funeral. </p> <p>The obstetric team seemed elusive and defensive. Richard Smith, the consultant, arrived in the morning following the birth. My husband pointed out that the notes had been annotated after the event, times clumsily crossed out and rewritten, but the consultant claimed that \"these small changes\" were not significant, as he felt there was only a 10-minute period which could be disputed and there was, after all, a CTG trace [of the foetal heartbeat] as a record. </p> <p>With extraordinary difficulty, we tried to gather together all those responsible for the delivery. The midwife was not available until four days after the birth. She was newly qualified and complained when summoned that she had had a terrible few days and it was not fair to question her. Another midwife present could not be traced at all. We were told that she had left the hospital to work in the community. We tried to get the head of midwifery to come to see us but she never came, despite many requests. </p> <p>Other departments were left to pick up the pieces. Hospital officialdom lurched into action. A reverend Brenda was sent to sit by my bed and told me she was very good at listening. I felt that good manners obliged me to say something, but there was nothing I could think of to say so we lapsed into an uncomfortable silence. A leaflet was handed to me entitled \"Complaints: listening ... acting ... improving\". We registered our complaint and were sent a letter a month later from someone we had never met on behalf of the chief executive to say that they were \"extremely sorry at the sad loss\" but ... it was nothing to do with them. As an exercise in public relations this letter badly misfired. It smelt of bureaucracy and amounted to an insult. What was missing was any real sense of sorrow. We seemed instead to be part of some sort of hideous bereavement package. We were offered a \"precious memory booklet\" which included Stella's handprints, footprints and identity bracelet. Hospital counsellors made soothing noises; we felt fobbed off and most emphatically did not want to hear their platitudes on grief. </p> <p>Last year and quite by accident I found myself face to face with Richard Smith, the consultant. He failed to recognise me, despite prompting. </p> <p>We had decided not to sue because we believed at the time that suing the hospital would achieve nothing. It could not bring her back and we would be forced to relive the circumstances of her birth and death time and time again, and to what end? Even if a court found that someone was to blame, the law cannot properly compensate for a broken heart. However, it is not sufficient for the medical staff to turn away while counsellors clear up the mess. This had the effect of redoubling our sense of injustice and grief. </p> <p>Of course mistakes are made. We made the mistake of being taken in by the glamorous exterior of the Chelsea and Westminster. All those big clean breezy spaces and art on the walls. Anyone who has ever been there knows that it bears little resemblance to other NHS hospitals, and we were impressed. Interestingly the Blairs chose it in preference to the scruffy but excellent St Thomas's hospital, which is much closer to Downing Street. What we failed to realise then was that this glossy exterior means nothing. The hospital is paradoxically a classic product of Thatcherism. Much of the labour has been contracted out. The cleaners, for instance, seemed sloppy and demoralised. The word \"team\" to describe those in the obstetric department responsible for me seemed to us to be a complete misnomer. As we struggled to gather them together after the event, we formed the strong impression that they didn't work as regularly together as the word implies. There was no consultant in the ward that night, and the only senior doctor present seemed very overstretched. The night of Leo Blair's birth I gather that Cherie was attended by her consultant, with four other senior doctors waiting in a nearby room. In other words she was better attended than at any private hospital. Delightful and happy outcome but not, of course, a standard NHS delivery. More a royal birth.</p>",

I repeat: are you a ticklish little girl?\" </p> <p>I tickled and tickled and tickled: terrible, merciless tickling, and with cruel variations too. Sometimes I'd suddenly stop tickling, raise my fingers above her in a ready-to-tickle position, growl like an agitated Yorkshire terrier - or maybe a Scottish one, I never can decide - then, after letting the tension rise to an unbearable peak, launch myself into further tickling, making Estelle squeal with delight. </p> <p>Other times I simply feigned these wicked lunges and instead of resuming tickling planted a huge, rude raspberry upon her tummy, hoping that, in her helplessness, she wouldn't pee on the upholstery. </p> <p>\"I give you this stern pledge, Miss Stone: if there is ticklishness in this house, I won't rest until it's rooted out!\" </p> <p>How we adore this stupid game, though not for wholly the same reasons. Of course, it's mostly an expression of her total trust in me, my sheer delight in her, our excited exploration of a shared sense of the sensual, the scary, the absurd and - should it need pointing out - an expression of our deep mutual love. </p> <p>But while Estelle experiences Tickling Terror as a hysterical adventure, for me it is piquantly nostalgic. </p> <p>Tickling Terror is a family tradition, one of several I'm determined to preserve. Others include the handing down of those few sentimental items of children's clothing that Dilys, my dear ex, didn't abscond with when she left me for the atrocious Chris the Pillock; and the stern ejection of monsters discovered hiding in tots' wardrobes come bedtime. </p> <p>Gloria, my eldest, was especially taken with this last one when she was about four, joining in excitedly as I stood there, hand on hip, wagging my index finger at imaginary trolls and tigers lurking among the frocks and socks, and insisting that they disperse into the garden (\"I've told you before: this is no place for beasties with big teeth. And close the door behind you!\"). </p> <p>Dilys used to enjoy this kind of nonsense, too, though she'd never admit it now, being utterly insistent that no man alive is more fluently conversant with his Inner Infant than Chris.

The government is due to publish its response to the report today, and there has been speculation that the prime minister, Tony Blair, will reject the recommendations. </p> <p> <b>What is all the fuss about?</b><br> The escalating number of special advisers under Labour has provoked accusations that Tony Blair is building up a presidential-style power base, giving him unprecedented control over Whitehall. Senior civil servants have expressed alarm that special advisers are controlling the link between ministers and civil servants. The special advisers have also been accused of using spin to influence the media to support their minister, often briefing against members of the cabinet. Charlie Whelan, former adviser to Gordon Brown, was forced to resign after being accused of briefing against Peter Mandelson over his home loan from Geoffrey Robinson - a charge Mr Whelan has always denied. In his report Lord Neill said that while the committee had not concluded that the growth in the use of advisers had led to the civil service being \"politicised\", he believed it was time to \"take stock\" of the situation. </p> <p> <b>How does Lord Neill plan to do that?</b><br> The report said a new code of conduct should be introduced, making it clear that special advisers had a specific duty to uphold the impartiality of the civil service as well as regulating their contacts with the media.</p> <p><b>How many special advisers are there?</b><br> The number of ministerial aides has jumped from 35 to 77 since Labour was elected, while the number in Downing Street has risen from eight to 28 in two years. </p> <p><b>What do they get paid?</b><br> The cost of special advisers to the taxpayer has risen from \u00a31.8m in 1997 to \u00a33.9m today, of which \u00a31.5m is concentrated in Downing Street. Salaries range from \u00a326,000 to \u00a380,000 for most special advisers, although there are exceptions: Alastair Campbell, the prime minister's press secretary, and Jonathan Powell, Mr Blair's chief of staff, each earn \u00a393,000. </p> <p> <b>Did Lord Neill make any other recommendations?</b><br> In his report he called on the government to make good its promise to turn the bribery of MPs and peers into a criminal offence. He also recommended sweeping changes in the appeal procedures for MPs facing misconduct charges in the wake of the cash for questions scandal, in which Sir Gordon Downey, the former parliamentary commissioner for standards, found \"compelling\" evidence that former minister Neil Hamilton had accepted \u00a325,000 from Mohamed Al Fayed to ask questions in the Commons. </p> <p><b>Anything else?</b><br>The report has called for curbs on task forces set up by the Labour government; the recording of all formal meetings with lobbyists and ministers; and the disclosure of sponsorship of government events above \u00a35,000.</p>",

How does Lord Neill plan to do that? The report said a new code of conduct should be introduced, making it clear that special advisers had a specific duty to uphold the impartiality of the civil service as well as regulating their contacts with the media. How many special advisers are there? The number of ministerial aides has jumped from 35 to 77 since Labour was elected, while the number in Downing Street has risen from eight to 28 in two years. What do they get paid? The cost of special advisers to the taxpayer has risen from \u00a31.8m in 1997 to \u00a33.9m today, of which \u00a31.5m is concentrated in Downing Street. Salaries range from \u00a326,000 to \u00a380,000 for most special advisers, although there are exceptions: Alastair Campbell, the prime minister's press secretary, and Jonathan Powell, Mr Blair's chief of staff, each earn \u00a393,000. Did Lord Neill make any other recommendations? In his report he called on the government to make good its promise to turn the bribery of MPs and peers into a criminal offence. He also recommended sweeping changes in the appeal procedures for MPs facing misconduct charges in the wake of the cash for questions scandal, in which Sir Gordon Downey, the former parliamentary commissioner for standards, found \"compelling\" evidence that former minister Neil Hamilton had accepted \u00a325,000 from Mohamed Al Fayed to ask questions in the Commons. Anything else? The report has called for curbs on task forces set up by the Labour government; the recording of all formal meetings with lobbyists and ministers; and the disclosure of sponsorship of government events above \u00a35,000.",

      "body": "<p>Betty Boothroyd, who makes her valedictory speech today, has been an outstanding speaker who has earned respect and affection from the whole House, not only for her personal qualities, but for the firm stand she has taken in the defence of parliament.</p> <p>The speaker has, over the centuries, been the voice of the Commons in a centralised political system in which the crown sought to control everything. Even today the powers of the crown remain unaltered, although they are now exercised by the prime minister who can, using the royal prerogatives, take us to war, sign treaties, make laws in Brussels and exercise immense powers of patronage, appointing bishops, judges, peers, ministers, European commissioners all without getting parliamentary consent.</p> <p>The slow advance towards democracy in this country, by the extension of the franchise, only gave every man and woman a vote at the same age in my lifetime. This conferred on them a power no MP dare ignore, although the people of this country are still denied the right to elect their head of state or members of the second chamber.</p> <p>There are likely to be more changes in the future, as new centres of power seek to dominate the political agenda. Today Britain, as a member of the EU, can have its laws repealed if they are found to conflict with legislation made by the Council of Ministers, in secret, in Brussels. The Commons has no say in the matter. And if Britain were to join the single currency all major economic decisions would be automatically excluded from any form of democratic accountability through parliament to the electors.</p> <p>Today the US has military bases in Britain entirely outside our control, from which nuclear strikes can be launched anywhere in the world. These are controlled by the president in Washington without any role for the Commons in Westminster.</p> <p>The mass media, occupying the position once held by the medieval church, are now very influential and the grand forum of the nation has moved from the chamber to the TV studios. Globalisation has produced multinational corporations which are more powerful than many nation states, currency speculation can inflict serious damage and the IMF, World Bank and WTO, all unelected, have in effect become a world government with no claim to democratic legitimacy.</p> <p>Set against those new power structures many people ask how their own interests can be effectively represented and indeed what is the future for democracy itself. Tight centralised executive control from Downing Street has replaced cabinet government and transformed parliamentary democracy into a spectator sport, a practice which is unlikely to change, even under a Conservative government.</p> <p>If we are to be expected to accept a president instead of a prime minister then we need a house of representatives, free to support, amend or reject proposals that come from the government of the day - a genuinely independent legislative assembly. A determined new speaker, armed with the authority of the House and absolutely free from executive control could raise these questions and hand down rulings from the chair which upheld the role of MPs as representing their constituents' interests, making ministers more accountable.</p> <p>There is no doubt that unless we can restore the vitality of representative democracy more and more people will conclude that they are just pawns in an unending political game to be managed and manipulated for the convenience of those at the top. This may help explain the falling turnout in elections, the growth of apathy and the sense of disenchantment with politics and parliament.</p> <p>Sooner or later this erosion of democracy has to be faced and corrected if we are to avoid the danger that some rightwing demagogue could come along, as happened in Europe in the 30s and has re-appeared recently in Austria.</p> <p>Over the centuries all real progress has come from below and parliament has usually been the last place to get the message. Any resumption of the campaign for democracy will have to start outside.

      "bodyText": "Betty Boothroyd, who makes her valedictory speech today, has been an outstanding speaker who has earned respect and affection from the whole House, not only for her personal qualities, but for the firm stand she has taken in the defence of parliament. The speaker has, over the centuries, been the voice of the Commons in a centralised political system in which the crown sought to control everything. Even today the powers of the crown remain unaltered, although they are now exercised by the prime minister who can, using the royal prerogatives, take us to war, sign treaties, make laws in Brussels and exercise immense powers of patronage, appointing bishops, judges, peers, ministers, European commissioners all without getting parliamentary consent. The slow advance towards democracy in this country, by the extension of the franchise, only gave every man and woman a vote at the same age in my lifetime. This conferred on them a power no MP dare ignore, although the people of this country are still denied the right to elect their head of state or members of the second chamber. There are likely to be more changes in the future, as new centres of power seek to dominate the political agenda. Today Britain, as a member of the EU, can have its laws repealed if they are found to conflict with legislation made by the Council of Ministers, in secret, in Brussels. The Commons has no say in the matter. And if Britain were to join the single currency all major economic decisions would be automatically excluded from any form of democratic accountability through parliament to the electors. Today the US has military bases in Britain entirely outside our control, from which nuclear strikes can be launched anywhere in the world. These are controlled by the president in Washington without any role for the Commons in Westminster. The mass media, occupying the position once held by the medieval church, are now very influential and the grand forum of the nation has moved from the chamber to the TV studios. Globalisation has produced multinational corporations which are more powerful than many nation states, currency speculation can inflict serious damage and the IMF, World Bank and WTO, all unelected, have in effect become a world government with no claim to democratic legitimacy. Set against those new power structures many people ask how their own interests can be effectively represented and indeed what is the future for democracy itself. Tight centralised executive control from Downing Street has replaced cabinet government and transformed parliamentary democracy into a spectator sport, a practice which is unlikely to change, even under a Conservative government. If we are to be expected to accept a president instead of a prime minister then we need a house of representatives, free to support, amend or reject proposals that come from the government of the day - a genuinely independent legislative assembly. A determined new speaker, armed with the authority of the House and absolutely free from executive control could raise these questions and hand down rulings from the chair which upheld the role of MPs as representing their constituents' interests, making ministers more accountable. There is no doubt that unless we can restore the vitality of representative democracy more and more people will conclude that they are just pawns in an unending political game to be managed and manipulated for the convenience of those at the top. This may help explain the falling turnout in elections, the growth of apathy and the sense of disenchantment with politics and parliament. Sooner or later this erosion of democracy has to be faced and corrected if we are to avoid the danger that some rightwing demagogue could come along, as happened in Europe in the 30s and has re-appeared recently in Austria. Over the centuries all real progress has come from below and parliament has usually been the last place to get the message. Any resumption of the campaign for democracy will have to start outside. That is why, after 50 years in the Commons, I have decided not to stand again so as to be free to devote more time to politics. What is needed now is a deliberate strategy to make political power accountable and to use democracy to protect us from the abuse of global economic power, which we are told we have to accept. Such a sustained public campaign would have overwhelming public support, especially from those active people who are working for progress but despair at the way the political system excludes them. If the Commons elects another strong speaker it would be a good start in shifting the balance back in our favour. Tony Benn is a former cabinet minister. He will stand down as MP for Chesterfield at the next election. comment@theguardian.com",

Russia wants to build 29 new reactors and consume 33,000kg of former warhead plutonium in its controversial new atomic programme. But in its anxiety to solve the plutonium problem, the west and Russia are turning a blind eye to past practices and Pirogov's current problems. He had a chilling tale to tell. </p> <p>All his life, save some time as a military mercenary, Pirogov had lived in the village of Atomanova on the eastern banks of the mighty Yenisei River - at nearly 3,500km long, the greatest in Siberia. Atomanova is 5km downstream from a vast nuclear complex formerly called Krasnoyarsk-26, now called the Mining Chemical Combine (MCC), at Zhelenzngorsk, one of three Sellafield-type nuclear combines in Russia. </p> <p>Built in 1950, it houses a reprocessing plant, nuclear waste stores, a part-built fast breeder plutonium fuel reactor, called RT-2, and a unique plutonium production reactor constructed entirely underground in a vast rock cavern to protect it against US nuclear attack in the Cold War. Zhelenzngorsk is one of 10 former Zatos - secret and closed military cities in Russia - now opened up. </p> <p>Pirigov said that, before 1988, the villagers of Atomanova did not even suspect that such a nuclear complex existed so close to their homes. But when they noticed large pipes being laid by the far bank of the Yenisei from their village, they inquired what was happening. Soon they discovered the pipes were for liquid nuclear waste disposal. </p> <p>Officials from the MCC gave the villagers a briefing about radiation effects on humans. With curiosity - and no little fear - aroused, the villagers put questions to the local administration, who knew little more than Pirigov and his neighbours. </p> <p>Angered but undeterred, the villagers petitioned the Krasnoyarsk Krai, the regional territory government responsible for an area 10 times the size of Britain. Even the professors at the city's university were in the dark about the Zato. </p> <p>Pirigov said that with the help of Vladimir Mikheev, director of the Krasnoyarsk citizen centre on non-proliferation, the Atomanova villagers finally discovered the pipes were for chanelling the nuclear waste deep underground. </p> <p>In all, the MCC planned to discharge over 25m cubic metres of plutonium-contaminated wastes deep into the earth. Pirigov was later pestered by the MCC security police, and told: \"You are helping the damned Americans with your fuss.\" </p> <p>On the nearby bank of the Yenisei, young girls would swim in the unusually warm water. It became clear to the villagers that the warmth had come from nuclear discharges at the MCC. As belated compensation, in 1996, Atomanova was offered 5m roubles to improve the village infrastructure. Two ambulances were bought for 520,000 roubles, yet the village failed to benefit from electricity generated at the reactors across the river. </p> <p>In support of Pirigov's claims, Dr Irina Osokina, chief of the endocrinology department at the Insititute for Medical Problems of the North, in Krasnoyarsk, unveiled research demonstrating that plutonium contamination in the area around the \"special protection zone\" at the MCC was between eight and 17 times the measurable plutonium from atmospheric weapons tests. </p> <p>Radioactive contamination has been found as far as 1,400km downstream on the Yenisei, which pours nearly 20,000 cubic metres of water per second into the Arctic. Expeditions by the Siberian Institute of Biophysics have found \"hot\" radioactive particles in many spots along the Yenisei riverbank, even at a forest campsite. The institute scientists estimate that the ill-fated campers would have unknowingly received a year's radiation dose in just three hours as they had fun in the forest. </p> <p>The worst radioactive contamination has been found on Gorodskoi island, near Atomanova, close to the radioactive effluent discharge pipe. Other surveys by the Siberian branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences have found contamination on the island, and at the nearby downstream village of Bolshoi Balchung, up to 1,000 times the caesium-137 discharged in the Chernobyl accident in 1986. Hot particles have also been found in the Yenisei flood plain and at Yeniseik City, nearly 400km north of MCC. </p> <p>German Kukashin, a former senior nuclear fuel scientist at the Mayak Chemical Combine nuclear complex, told of a serious accident at research reactors at the State Scientific Centre Research Insititute of Atomic Reactors, at Dimitrovgrad, in the Ulyanovsk region east of Moscow. Kukashin was later sacked for his attempts to publicise the accident risks. </p> <p>The Mayak complex is one of the most polluted places on the planet. In 1957, a nuclear waste storage tank exploded, scattering highly toxic waste over the local villages. They were not evacuated for two weeks, despite the Soviet atomic authorities knowing people had to be moved within 36 hours to ensure protective measures might work. </p> <p>One village has never been evacuated. Despite being in the centre of the danger zone, the 4,500 people of Muslumova have stayed for decades because it is the local railway halt. Every summer children still flock to the village by rail to see their grandparents.

As somebody who fosters troubled teenagers, I have to say the experience has shattered my idealism and faith in the system. </p> <p>We all know teenagers can be difficult. Even those from \"normal\" families put their parents through hell at times. It goes without saying that young people who have been traumatised by negative experiences, then suffered the consequences of being in care, are bound to be problematic. </p> <p>I recently watched a television chat show obviously designed to promote the government's drive to recruit more foster carers. Unfortunately, the programme reinforced the old- fashioned, sentimental stereotype of fostering, instead of awaking the public to the fact that, if we are to accommodate the growing numbers of adolescents in need of placements, we must change our traditional views of the role of fostering. </p> <p>Our society is ever more complex and confused, and the teenagers who, for whatever reason, cannot remain with their own families reflect this in their behaviour. Is it not naive to expect well-meaning but untrained people to give up their time, energy and - most importantly - their quality of life in return for pin money, and then wonder why the drop-out rate in fostering is so high? </p> <p>I foster for an agency which provides experienced carers for what are euphemistically labelled \"challenging\" youngsters aged 11-18. This scheme promised to \"change the face of fostering\". We would be seen as equal, full-time workers, receiving a weekly salary in addition to the care allowance. We would be given regular training on different aspects of behaviour management and there would be 24-hour emergency support. </p> <p>When I first joined, I was fired with enthusiasm. I felt that, at last, steps were being taken towards valuing foster carers as skilled, knowledgeable professionals, and I saw my new job as a career I could really put my heart into. I fully understood that, owing to all the cases of abuse by carers that have come to light, very thorough assessments and monitoring of placements were necessary. What I failed to realise was that the checks were as much about covering the backs of the management as about protecting the children. </p> <p>Now, two years later, I am disillusioned and very pessimistic about fostering. This is not because of the young people who have been placed with me during this time - although I have had more than my fair share of challenging behaviour to cope with - but because of the unrealistic and unreasonable restrictions placed on myself and my family, and the fact that young people in care do not receive the consideration they deserve. </p> <p>Nobody, for example, is allowed to stay overnight under my roof unless they have been police checked. (Abuse, apparently, only happens at night). These checks take two to three months, so as soon as I was accepted by the project - and knowing I would have little opportunity to go out to socialise from then on - I got all friends and family members who stay overnight occasionally with us to submit forms for police checks. </p> <p>Shortly after, a memo was circulated to all carers, stating that unless a person had \"substantial, unsupervised contact\" with our foster children the agency would not agree (for financial reasons) to carry out the checks. When we pointed out we would never leave our young people in the care of visitors, we were told to say - in order to get the checks done - that we did. I refused because I did not want to portray myself as somebody who leaves her foster children with all and sundry. </p> <p>So until the project manager agreed, months later, to accept \"subject access\" police checks, which are not as thorough but can be applied for at police stations, I could not see many of my friends or family who did not live locally. Even my mother and elder daughter were not allowed to sleep at my house. When my sister, who lives abroad, needed to stay with me in a sudden emergency, I was told that if she did I would be classed as \"unavailable\" and my salary would be stopped. </p> <p>When my partner's daughter and her family became homeless, he moved in with me temporarily so that they could use his flat. I explained this to my link worker and was informed that, even though my partner had already been investigated as stringently as myself, he would have to move out until a six-month assessment of our relationship had been completed, leaving him homeless. </p> <p>Then there is discipline. I am expected to teach my foster children social behaviour and acceptance of boundaries, yet I am not allowed to punish them in any way. Even when one of my foster children threatened, \"I'll show you who can play games,\" and then made allegations against me, I was told not to let her feel responsible for what she had done. On one occasion, I needed to phone for help because a 13-year-old girl I was fostering had trashed my house and was attempting to break down my bedroom door. The \"emergency assistance\" I received was advice to ask friends to come over to give me moral support. </p> <p> Worst of all is the peremptory treatment of carers and those they care for. I formed a particular bond with a 16-year-old girl during the four months she was with me, only for her to be moved to another carer because our relationship was seen as \"too close\" and not politically correct - being between a white carer and a mixed-race child. She and I were led to believe the move was to give me \"respite\", whereas her new (black) carer was aware she would not be returning to me but was instructed not to say so. </p> <p>I do not regret having returned to fostering. It has been what they call \"an experience\", and I am convinced it should be redefined as a full-time, decently paid profession - particularly for fostering adolescents. I have heard all the rubbish about this not being a good idea because it would attract people \"for the wrong reasons\". But why is that logic never applied to doctors or social workers? </p> <p>Now I've had enough. I am tired of being owned, body and soul, and of having to ask permission for anything I want to do. I am fed up with being expected to put my foster children before the needs of my own family. And I am sick of feeling continually stressed in my own house. In short, I want my life back. </p> <p>\u0095 Jenny Sinclair is the pseudonym of a foster carer in the south of England.</p>",

Even when one of my foster children threatened, \"I'll show you who can play games,\" and then made allegations against me, I was told not to let her feel responsible for what she had done. On one occasion, I needed to phone for help because a 13-year-old girl I was fostering had trashed my house and was attempting to break down my bedroom door. The \"emergency assistance\" I received was advice to ask friends to come over to give me moral support. Worst of all is the peremptory treatment of carers and those they care for. I formed a particular bond with a 16-year-old girl during the four months she was with me, only for her to be moved to another carer because our relationship was seen as \"too close\" and not politically correct - being between a white carer and a mixed-race child. She and I were led to believe the move was to give me \"respite\", whereas her new (black) carer was aware she would not be returning to me but was instructed not to say so. I do not regret having returned to fostering. It has been what they call \"an experience\", and I am convinced it should be redefined as a full-time, decently paid profession - particularly for fostering adolescents. I have heard all the rubbish about this not being a good idea because it would attract people \"for the wrong reasons\". But why is that logic never applied to doctors or social workers? Now I've had enough. I am tired of being owned, body and soul, and of having to ask permission for anything I want to do. I am fed up with being expected to put my foster children before the needs of my own family. And I am sick of feeling continually stressed in my own house. In short, I want my life back. \u0095 Jenny Sinclair is the pseudonym of a foster carer in the south of England.",

      "body": "<p>Looking at Coto Do\u00f1ana in this year's sunshine, it's hard to believe only two years ago it was the site of Europe's worst toxic spill. The lagoons and marshes, now drying up for summer, teem with wildlife. Flamingos move in the shallows among wading birds. There are storks' nests on buildings and every so often a black shadow moves across the marshes; usually it's a black kite but occasionally it's a massive, imperial eagle. Do\u00f1ana looks like the world heritage site it is, designated thus because its complex wetland ecology sustains an astonishing variety of plant, bird and animal species, including Europe's most endangered carnivore, the Iberian lynx. </p> <p>Late in April 1998, the wall of the tailings pool of Los Frailles mine in Aznalcollar broke, spilling millions of tons of toxic sludge including cadmium, lead, zinc and mercury, into the river Guadiamar, which in turn feeds into the waters of Do\u00f1ana national park. The effect was catastrophic. All life was destroyed in that river stretch, including 37 tons of dead fish. Many species have disappeared for good. </p> <p>The enormous scale of the clean-up operations shows the extent of the disaster. Three dams were built, one after another, to prevent the slick's deadly journey. It finally stopped at the entrance to the national park, spreading out on to surrounding land. Affected farmland, stretching for 15,000 acres, has been permanently decommissioned and for two years bulldozers and trucks have been razing up the surface of the land, ferrying their poisonous load back to Aznalcollar. So far the cost, split between the local council, central government and Boliden, the mine's owners, is estimated at 30,000 pesetas (\u00a3112m). </p> <p>Only one village (successfully) opposed the lorries passing through. Most, whose inhabitants work in the mining industry, downplayed the disaster. Now they prove their confidence by eating the local shellfish again. There's some basis for their optimism. Soil pollution levels are back below danger level after the clean up and initial fears that poisons would enter the groundwater have not been confirmed. But sub-lethal effects of these chemicals are long term and evidence so far is unsettling. </p> <p>Very high zinc concentrations have been found in plants known for their resistance to pollution; these plants are the main food for several bird species on Do\u00f1ana. This year, scores of white stork have beak deformities never before seen in Andalusia. Local environmentalists are horrified that after such a near miss the mine is coming back into use without new safeguards and guarantees. </p> <p>Far from overstating the problem, the disaster has highlighted Do\u00f1ana's extreme vulnerability. In spite of its undisputed ecological importance, the area is under extreme pressure not only from mining. Spain's rapid development, underscored by European Union subsidies, is just as threatening. Where the national park previously merged ambiguously into scrubland, there is now intensive development. On one approach, field on field of strawberries and other vegetables grow under acres of plastic. On another, Matalascanas has grown up, a concrete jungle of apartments for sand and sea tourism. All around, the old cork forests are disappearing and the European Union is financing new roads in the area. </p> <p>Do\u00f1ana biologist, Miguel Delibes describes the area as \"uniquely threatened\". He says: \"Most areas of such exceptional environmental value are fixed landscapes, already defined. But technical advances mean people can use this land now so they want to reclaim and transform it.\" Delibes, the son of another Miguel Delibes, one of Spain's best known novelists, has been working on Do\u00f1ana for 30 years studying the Iberian lynx which, although protected there and sometimes used as the region's symbol, now borders on extinction. \"The lynx's plight is symbolic of the area's problems,\" he says. </p> <p>The Iberian lynx is a beautiful animal, resembling the American bobcat in shape and fluid movement but with a more dramatically spotted coat and a distinctive beard around the face. Although smaller than the African big cats, it is bigger than the European wildcat and more savage. Yet in spite of its charisma, it is now the world's most endangered feline species. There are only 600 in Spain and Portugal. On Do\u00f1ana, there are only 50 and, even with full protection, they are still illegally hunted and trapped. </p> <p>It's the lynx's isolation in small, scarcely viable populations that puts them at risk. Like all cats, they are territorial and before they reach a year old the cubs set out to find their own territory, but there's no way out to new mates. One radio-tracked lynx managed to travel 200 miles but turned back to be killed on one of Do\u00f1ana's fast roads. There's only one healthy captive lynx in the world, at the Do\u00f1ana Biological Research Centre. Researchers are not allowed to trap her a wild mate, but when one jumped into her enclosure permission was given to extract sperm. </p> <p>The lynx can survive only within a network of viable habitats. Above all that means the dehesa, the traditional cork forests of Iberia. These give the lynx shelter and its main food, rabbits. When a cork forest falls out of use, due among other things to the increased use of plastic corks, depopulation follows. Then big landowners move in, availing themselves of EU grants for fast-growing timber. Between the late 70s and early 90s vast swathes of eucalyptus were planted. In Portugal, where the entire population of Iberian lynxes is now estimated at only 60, this has been nothing short of an ecological catastrophe. </p> <p> The Iberian lynx's fate says everything about the failures of European environmental legislation. The 1992 habitats directive was meant to ensure \"favourable conservation status\" of highly endangered species by making countries provide a network of \"Natura 2000\" sites. Like all other EU countries, Spain is hopelessly behind with proposals for this while happily channelling EU funds and subsidies into projects which undermine the chance of the lynx's survival. </p> <p>Ironically, the last best chance for Do\u00f1ana's lynxes has emerged from the mining accident. For years, the local council heard arguments about the lynxes' need for ecological corridors to other lynx populations. Last year it announced that the decommissioned land around the disaster area would become a \"green corridor\", land permanently set aside to revert to nature and link up with the Sierra Morena, the other lynx area in Spain. </p> <p>Although environmentalists worry the corridor might not \"hit\" the Sierra Morena at the right place, they have still thrown themselves into this project. It's popular with locals for providing alternative employment and promising to attract new tourism. And if it offers hope to Do\u00f1ana's lynx population, perhaps the toxic spill won't have been a total disaster.</p>",

Brought up on a farm in Worcestershire, he studied geography at Nottingham University, before taking a well-paid job with good prospects at Barclays bank. The wider problems of society passed him by. So when the 23 year old, who works as an assistant to a corporate director at Barclays' Birmingham offices, walked though the main gates of Pentonville prison in London earlier this month, he was understandably nervous. </p> <p>Orgee already had firm views on law and order. \"I was under the impression that all nasty people should be banged up and if they reoffended they should be banged up for longer,\" he says. A morning behind bars, touring Pentonville's gaunt Victorian corridors and bare 13x6 cells, rounded off by a chat about the judicial system with an inmate who is serving time for drug offences and whose parents are both crack addicts, gave him pause for thought. </p> <p>Even more significant in making him rethink his opinions was the chance to discuss his reactions with other young people on the tour from a mixed bag of jobs in the private, public and voluntary sectors. </p> <p>\"It has challenged my views. I see things in 3D instead of 2D now,\" he says in the wake of the prison visit. Now, he thinks, he understands why people may become mixed up in crime. He no longer believes prison is the sole answer. \"If someone has done a crime I don't think they should just be locked up, but should be looked at as an individual,\" says the enlightened Orgee. </p> <p>The transformation is the result of a week-long programme, Navigator, run by charity Common Purpose. Aimed at high-fliers under 30 in their first careers in the private, public and voluntary sectors, it offers a crash course in how modern urban society works. The hope is to grow informed, active citizens for the future. </p> <p>As well as touring a prison, participants visit a housing regeneration scheme, a hospital and a drugs project; undertake exercises which challenge their attitudes; and get a chance to question panels of leading movers and thinkers from government, the arts, business and caring professions. At the end of the course, each participant produces a project, with help from a leading expert in the field, which they later present to top executives at their own organisation. And ultimately, each course graduate is asked to say what they plan to do personally as a result of their investigations. </p> <p>The idea, explains programme director Lucy Aspinall, is to encourage people to look beyond themselves and their organisations to see the interconnecting pieces of the city jigsaw. \"It changes their lives,\" she says. \"Several have said they will never look at the world in the same way as they did.\" One civil servant on last year's programme was so impressed by a school visit that she is now training to become a teacher. </p> <p>Crucially, by throwing together people from public, private and voluntary areas, the programme challenges preconceived notions about those sectors. \"It is a big eye-opener for the private sector to find out not everyone in the voluntary sector knits yoghurt at lunchtime,\" says Aspinall. One past member from business came away astonished to find voluntary sector staff were \"almost good enough to work in the private sector\". But learning is not all one way. Those in the public and voluntary spheres learn \"corporate speak\" from their business counterparts and discover that their aims and skills are not necessarily at odds. </p> <p>Navigator is one of several programmes run by Common Purpose, an educational charity founded little more than a decade ago. Other schemes, with the same general theme, are aimed at senior professionals, people over 50 and school pupils, and the principle has since been exported abroad. The charity's income comes from course fees, with businesses generally subsidising voluntary groups, and private sector sponsorship. Navigator, which has been dubbed the \"street-smart MBA\", was launched last year and now runs annually in London, Edinburgh and Belfast. </p> <p>Not everyone on the Navigator programme has such a cathartic experience as Orgee, who disarmingly admits that he began each day with a \"narrow set of views\" which had changed by the evening. But most of the 22 participants, from organisations including the police, NHS, BBC, Thames Water and Refugee Council, come away somewhat wiser. </p> <p>\"It helps knowing what some of the people I talk to have been through,\" says Clare Riches, 25, a fundraiser with a London housing association, after meeting Ron, a gently spoken young man about to be released from Pentonville under the experimental tagging scheme. </p> <p>Stephen Cave, a 26-year-old solicitor with the Department of Environment, Transport and Regions, says the week has highlighted how social issues cannot be seen in isolation. \"If you have a reasonable upbringing and reasonable support it is so much easier to achieve what we have achieved,\" he says. \"Perhaps these people haven't had that.\" </p> <p>Bhavin Patel, 22, who also works for Barclays after graduating from King's College London last year, says the programme has convinced him that education is the key to changing society. \"I never really knew about the poverty that happened in London,\" says Patel, after visiting an east end housing estate. He is now writing a project on child poverty which he will present to Barclays' managers. He believes many companies have too narrow a view on life and aims to keep in touch with people, such as staff from the Refugee Council, he has met during the week. </p> <p>Previous Navigator participants have generated valuable contacts. Paula Ross, 27, chief executive of the medical charity Bart's City Life Saver, keeps in touch with the Department of Health civil servant she met on last year's London programme and they each agreed to shadow the other to gain insight into their different worlds. Similar partnerships have emerged from other Common Purpose courses. A senior partner in a law firm, which was asked to help with the bursary for a black headteacher, now meets regularly with the teacher to talk through common issues, like budgeting and personnel. </p> <p>Magistrate Sandie Blandford, who has helped Navigator participants muddle their way through the criminal justice maze, is herself a Common Purpose graduate. \"I just found it so valuable,\" says Blandford, who works as a chief immigration officer at Heathrow. \"It gives you a chance to look at areas you don't know anything about.\" She forged links with another participant working with a charity for people with learning disabilities and now helps out by staging mock job interviews for his clients. </p> <p>Certainly as far as William Orgee is concerned, life will never be the same again.

Paula Ross, 27, chief executive of the medical charity Bart's City Life Saver, keeps in touch with the Department of Health civil servant she met on last year's London programme and they each agreed to shadow the other to gain insight into their different worlds. Similar partnerships have emerged from other Common Purpose courses. A senior partner in a law firm, which was asked to help with the bursary for a black headteacher, now meets regularly with the teacher to talk through common issues, like budgeting and personnel. Magistrate Sandie Blandford, who has helped Navigator participants muddle their way through the criminal justice maze, is herself a Common Purpose graduate. \"I just found it so valuable,\" says Blandford, who works as a chief immigration officer at Heathrow. \"It gives you a chance to look at areas you don't know anything about.\" She forged links with another participant working with a charity for people with learning disabilities and now helps out by staging mock job interviews for his clients. Certainly as far as William Orgee is concerned, life will never be the same again. He reflects: \"I shall certainly be a lot more open-minded.\" Changing hearts and minds Common Purpose is an apolitical educational charity launched in 1989 to bring together key workers in private, public and voluntary sectors in an effort to improve cities. More than 10,000 people have been through its programmes. It runs a range of events, with the same general aim, targeted at different groups. They include: Matrix runs in more than 30 cities, over 11 days during one year; aimed at senior policy makers. Profile offers a two-day briefing on what makes a city tick; for experienced leaders new to the city. 20/20 a five-day programme just starting to work at national level; for emerging leaders. Your Turn brings together 14 year olds from different schools, to learn about their city. Navigator five-day programme for \"rising stars\" under 30. What Next designed for older people looking to change the way they live or work.",

      "body": "<p>A copy of David Starkey's book on Elizabeth I lies on a long stool, next to one of the author's feet. He needs to take the weight off it, having just returned from a visit to hospital. A physiotherapist has apparently been working on an area which some of his adversaries in academia and the media have been trying to discover for years: his achilles heel. </p> <p>Starkey's waspish wit and trenchant libertarian-Conservative views have guaranteed him plenty of air time and review space to supplement his day job as a historian at the London School of Economics. Channel 4 recently broadcast the televisionseries to go with his book on Elizabeth. And on August 6 he will pop up again, on BBC1 this time, as an interviewee in Peter Jay's series on the history of money. </p> <p>Starkey's appearance in The Road to Riches is little more than a cameo role, or \"vignette\" as he prefers to call it. But he is characteristically disruptive, thrusting the equivalent of a stick into the wheels of Jay's stately, linear progress through the history of the industrial revolution. Starkey points out that the technological change that transformed this country's economy would never have happened without a massive demand for household goods. </p> <p>\"We've got to stand the idea of the industrial revolution on its head. Market first, smoke-stack industry second,\" he tells Jay as they travel around Bath on a bus. The city beyond the window is, he says, the first designed just to attract the consumer. Back home in his elegant mid-Victorian house in Highbury, north London, he rests his other foot on the stool, leans back and warms to his theme. \"Bath was the Bluewater of the 18th century,\" he says, \"only with better taste. It worked because of the extraordinarily wide distribution of wealth in England, compared with continental Europe. Look at the substantial number of Georgian houses, items of furniture and silverware which have survived and you begin to appreciate the scale of this middling prosperity.\" </p> <p>On screen and at home, he quotes approvingly from Dr Bernard de Mandeville, a Dutch \u00e9migr\u00e9 who came to England in the early 18th century and put himself at odds with the Church. It was not virtue and self-restraint but vice that drove a powerful economy, he maintained. And Starkey agrees. </p> <p>\"Suppose we practised charity, self- denial and honesty, women were chaste and we didn't fight wars,\" he muses, paraphrasing de Mandeville. \"The entire economy would collapse. What happened in the 18th century was a revolution in the appurtenances of living. A significant number of people had bigger houses with more rooms for possessions. I would argue that there's a straight line from there to the America of the 21st century.\" </p> <p>What about the UK? \"We're getting there,\" he says. \"The economies that thrive are the consuming economies.\" </p> <p>Ironically enough, it was winning the environmental studies prize at primary school in 1956 that set him off on this train of thought. He was handed a book called The History of Everyday Things in England and it seems to have had a profound effect on him. Indeed, he removes both feet from the stool and limps over to pluck it lovingly from one of his crowded shelves. Then - irony upon irony - this avowed rightwinger goes on to recommend that I re-read English Journey by that old socialist, JB Priestley. </p> <p>\"As long ago as the 1930s, Priestley could see that the North was in decline and the Midlands were drifting,\" he says. \"Even then the future lay in the new America: those art deco factories around the North Circular Road [in London], turning out vacuum cleaners and cameras.\" </p> <p>Starkey proudly proclaims himself to be a supporter of the \"candyfloss economy\", being acutely conscious that \"shopping matters\". The old smoke-stack industries, he feels, were allowed to outstay their sell-by date because of the second world war and the trend of post-war governments to buck the markets with the help of a civil service \"designed to administer an empire rather than an entrepreneurial society\". </p> <p>The coming of Margaret Thatcher in 1979 began \"the long march\" away from all that. But if Starkey has his way, we'll be marching back towards the 18th century in search of a solution to the social problems thrown up by our 21st-century consumer economy. What we need, apparently, is a return to craft working and domestic service. </p> <p>\"We should recognise that only around a third of the population can be in internationally competitive jobs,\" he says. \"So we need to develop a middle-band craft economy like the one the French have so cleverly maintained. The wealthy are bored with mass-produced goods. But to meet the growing demand for craftsmanship there would have to be a reinstatement of apprenticeships. </p> <p>\"At the same time we should be thinking about reconstituting a genuine service economy. The mere mention of domestic service brings some people out in spots of outrage, but there is a crying need for relatively low-level employment. It's ridiculous that people at the top are killing themselves in demanding jobs and then coming home to mow their own lawns. </p> <p>\"If Blair and Brown are serious about cutting long-term benefits then those at the bottom are going to have to be found work. Floating the idea that every kid in Brixton can become a whizkid at information technology is dishonest.\" </p> <p>If there seems to be a whiff of racism about that remark, then perhaps it's misleading. Whatever else you might think about David Starkey, he does appear to be an enthusiastic champion of minorities - by race, religion and sexual orientation - albeit as vital contributors to a dynamic economy. \"Often excluded from the normal processes of government and mainstream society, they've had no alternative but to work hard and make money,\" he says, citing the Jews, the Huguenots, the Quakers, many modern Asians and \"increasing numbers of West Indian women\". </p> <p>Starkey himself has links with two minority groups. He's openly gay and he was brought up a Quaker. Not that he has much time for the Quakers. \"When I was growing up, they had lost their hard-headed commercial edge and become rather socialist, like the Guardian at prayer.\" It's evident that the young David was only too happy to escape from his rather stiflingly austere upbringing in the north of England - first to Cambridge University and then to London. \"You could say that my life since has been a sustained act of luxurious rebellion,\" he confides with a mischievous smile. </p> <p>He looks on his fellow homosexuals as a very significant economic force, not only as creators in fields like fashion and interior design but also as above-average spenders. \"We don't have children,\" he says, \"and a large percentage of us tend to be in high- income jobs. The level of disposable income is enormous\". </p> <p>No wonder Starkey looks pleased with himself, despite his achilles heel. He's in demand as author, pundit and critic, boosting his income from academia and enabling him to fulfil what he would deem a vital social role - as a rampant consumer.</p> <p><strong>A nation of shop assistants?</strong></p> <p>Is David Starkey right to suggest that consuming things matters more than making them? It's certainly the case that Britain, like most advanced economies, is shifting from an industrial economy to a services-based economy, writes Charlotte Denny . </p> <p>Twenty years ago, manufacturing accounted for about a quarter of the economy; today, it has shrunk to just over a fifth. Jobs in manufacturing now account for 16% of total employment; 20 years ago, it was 28%. The new jobs are all in the service sector, such as retailing, business services and call centres. </p> <p>Conventional economic thinking has always portrayed this shift as a natural progression - a sort of economic version of the theory of evolution. Advanced economies will find their industrial base is gradually eroded by competition from low-wage economies in the developing world. The US, as always, is seen to be the leader; manufacturing there accounts for just 15% of jobs. </p> <p>So does it matter if we end up as a nation of shoppers and shopkeepers? The problem is that many of the new jobs in the service economy are just not that attractive in terms of pay and conditions. The advantage of the manufacturing sector is that it provides relatively well paid jobs for a wide range of abilities. </p> <p>Eamonn Fingleton, author of In Praise of Hard Industries, points out that the countries with the highest per capita incomes - Germany, Switzerland, Japan - all have strong manufacturing bases. \"This is a reflection of the fact that [manufacturing] workers are typically backed by large amounts of capital and proprietary production know-how,\" he says. \"These greatly enhance workers' productivity, and greater productivity is the royal road to higher wages.\" </p> <p>Britain could become a nation of shop assistants and domestic service workers - with a lucky few employed in the professions, able to enjoy the fruits of the consumer economy. But as personal service and retail jobs are among the worst paid occupations, there is a strong case for seeking to remain a nation of producers rather than sellers.</p> <p>\u0095 The Road to Riches is on BBC1 on Sunday week (August 6) at 8pm</p>",

Derek Bodell Chief executive National Aids Trust Alien context It is an interesting experience when you read your own words in a major newspaper in a context that implies something entirely alien. I was quoted as \"admitting\" that relatively few psychologists work in the field of schizophrenia (It's good to talk, June 28). Psychologists are actively working in the field of \"serious mental illness\" and have much to offer in terms of scientific understanding and psychological therapy.

At the conference, an elderly white person was talking about the needs of the Bangladeshi immigrants in Tower Hamlets. She said 500 had no school places. I thought: 'I need to know more.'\" </p> <p>Through that contact, she began work in London's east end, initially in Tower Hamlets at Central Foundation, a girl's school with mainly Muslim pupils. Central Foundation put her in touch with Langdon Park in Poplar, east London, the state comprehensive in which the schools' fund, which runs home-school liaison and truancy services, had started in 1977. </p> <p>The fund's founder director, Bridget Cramp, recruited her as the sixth worker and she became director on Cramp's retirement in 1995. The charity then worked in 25 schools. Now it has 83 schools on its books, a staff of 100, and it offers consultancy to other charities. </p> <p>Sister Mary's first job as director was to set up a professional financial administration. A year ago, she handed on the administrative directorship to become development director, setting up the consultancy, School Home Support UK, and running staff mentoring and a welfare fund for families. These arms, she says, help the administrators stay in touch with grassroots needs. </p> <p>\"The issue is always the same - attendance. It is the underlying causes that change. Every application is different. We have just had a sixth-form student living alone and working in McDonald's who wanted a month off for revision.\" </p> <p>Her directorship might seem a far cry from her religious life, but it is, she says, in the tradition of Mary Ward, founder of her order. She was a 17th-century Yorkshire woman who went to prison for her right to educate. </p> <p>Mary Walmsley was born in Hertfordshire, daughter of a teacher mother and a father who worked for London Midland and Scottish railways. The family spent annual holidays in Yorkshire. \"One day, my parents said why don't we live in York,\" she recalls. </p> <p>For the young Mary, 15 and working for O-levels, moving was disruptive. \"But I survived.\" She returned south to train as a primary teacher, then taught for two years before going as a novice nun to a convent in Ascot, Berkshire. \"In the first year, we did the washing up and sorting clothes for our boarding school. In the second year, I did some teaching. We did everything, made meals, played games, put them to bed.\" </p> <p>In 1976, she was sent to York when the city was going comprehensive and her order realised the Bar Convent school had to amalgamate. It was a time of religious upheaval, with nuns moving out of the walled institution into the community. Two of her closest friends left the order, but she did not have that struggle. \"I work better from a community,\" she says. </p> <p>At the grammar school, she was put in charge of year seven. On amalgamation, she applied for the headship of All Saints lower school. It was her first experience of applying, previous moves having been directed by the order. \"When I went to York, I was just summoned to the parlour and told,\" she says </p> <p>All Saints was, she says, \"a lovely school, truly comprehensive\". But it did not prepare her for London. When she said she needed a break, her \"provincial\" - the head of the order in Britain - suggested she move to a small house being established in north London. Until the Leeds conference, six weeks after she moved, she had no idea what work she might do in the capital. </p> <p>The Central Foundation school put her on \"the steepest learning curve\", she says. \"The Muslim families were a revelation. They were so hospitable, but it was so sensitive. I felt very helpless. I had done some work in York on inter-faith, but it was all from books, totally head stuff.\" </p> <p>Now, a decade of sharp-end experience later, Sister Mary is about to return to York to become superior of the 400-year-old Bar convent, running its conference and resource centres. She will, she says, be going back a much rounder person. She found the administration of the schools' fund sometimes tedious, dealing with payrolls and pensions. \"One of the hardest things is to be a good employer,\" she acknowledges. \"The interests are totally mixed.\" </p> <p>Now it is time to put something back into the order. As superior, she says, the buck will stop with her. But after the east end, it will be like stepping back in time. \"There are still very few non-white faces.

It signifies a fresh start in the government's modernisation campaign, designed to boost confidence in the ability of the NHS to raise standards to levels our fellow Europeans take for granted. But in the light of hard experience, people will wonder, understandably, whether once again they are being handed a false prospectus. They will need some convincing that this latest overhaul is superior to all those past efforts that governments would rather like them to forget. </p> <p>The historical record confirms that such scepticism is justified. The 20th century was littered with botched refits of the service, with the time intervals between them growing progressively shorter. This galloping instability of policy has been damaging to morale within the NHS and to public confidence. </p> <p>The characteristics of the healthcare problem have long been familiar. As far back as 1920, the Dawson report identified the challenge and provided a cogent outline of a scheme for a modern health service. Dawson acknowledged that \"insufficiency of organisation\" was already preventing the advantages of modern medical knowledge reaching the people. </p> <p>That report proposed a remarkably far-sighted plan for a co-ordinated system of primary, secondary and tertiary care, based on a system of health centres and involving the unification of preventive and curative medicine. Despite the acknowledged wisdom of this scheme, in major respects it still remains largely unrealised. </p> <p>Tragically, the Dawson scheme was left to gather dust, with the important consequence that already during the interwar period, Britain was begin ning to slip down the league tables of healthcare. Even at the start of the second world war, when action to modernise healthcare was inescapable, the government failed to take decisive action. Its hand was finally forced by William Beveridge, who insisted that his scheme for social security must be underpinned by his \"assumption B\", entailing commitment to a comprehensive health service. </p> <p>This broke the log jam, but the government squandered its opportunity and spent the rest of the war squabbling with the British Medical Association over the shape of a future health service. Horsetrading ended with a blueprint of impossible complexity that was incapable of implementation. By supreme good fortune, however, the health portfolio of the 1945 Labour government went to Aneurin Bevan, the youngest member of Clem Attlee's cabinet. Bevan had the audacity to scrap the previous plans and adopt an entirely different framework. Although his scheme was very much a hasty contrivance, involving some important concessions to vested interests, it proved an adequate working arrangement that persisted for some 25 years. </p> <p>The main problem during this period was resource starvation, a difficulty that set in at an early stage and famously led to Bevan's resignation from the government. </p> <p>From the mid-60s on, a decade of deliberation over reorganisation represented a staggering record of ineptitude on the part of both Labour and Conservative governments. The result was a worst-of-worlds blueprint in the form of the 1974 reorganisation. </p> <p>This promised \"a fully integrated health service\" capable of making up for lost time and realising the ambitious humanitarian objectives adopted in 1948. This goal was to be attained through imposition of a \"sound management structure created at all levels\". Governments were initially confident that the management solution would clear up the problems of the NHS without calling for additional resources. And, at least initially, the new system attracted a positive response from within the service. </p> <p>However, outside critics were sceptical, seeing the reforms as what the independent office of health economics called a \"political device intended not to alter standards of health care but to impress the public with merely symbolic changes\". At first, the government and NHS establishment fought to preserve the essence of the new system, but support melted away and it soon became evident that the 1974 reorganisation was a gigantic mistake. </p> <p>This was a watershed. From the 70s on, every year was dogged by crisis. Cosmetic changes were tried, but under the relentless pressure of resource starvation it became evident the creaking system was under intolerable strain. Despite growing public alarm, however, no attempt was made to achieve a new consensus on the way forward. Instead, as a response to the winter crisis of 1987, the Thatcher government embarked on a confidential review, which launched the NHS into its \"internal market\" reforms. </p> <p> Announced as the biggest overhaul of the NHS since its creation, these offered all the benefits that had been claimed for the 1974 reorganisation. The internal market blueprint was sold in 1991 with a far more sophisticated public relations campaign than that used 17 years previously, and an appearance of success was achieved by a short-lived burst of additional spending. This secured temporary relief from the relentless cycle of crisis, but the spending controls were soon reapplied and no amount of public relations spin was able to prevent collapse of public confidence. </p> <p>The Labour opposition deftly exploited the public mood and in this undoubtedly contributed to its massive electoral success in 1997. Within a matter of months, the new government - with Frank Dobson at the helm of health - came up with its own blueprint for the future. Conscious of the momentous changes it was introducing, the white paper of December 1997, The New NHS, borrowed its title from Bevan's leaflet describing the NHS in 1948. </p> <p>Dobson announced that his scheme was a 10-year programme of modernisation. And Labour invested so much confidence in its own form of \"integrated care\" that it felt able to commit itself to the Tories' parsimonious spending plans - with the inevitable consequence that the NHS once more plunged back into its cycle of crisis. Now, with Dobson thrown overboard, health secretary Alan Milburn is starting afresh with yet another 10-year modernisation programme, promising a more radical approach than previously adopted. </p> <p>Milburn, however, possesses one incomparable advantage denied all of his predecessors. For the first time in the history of the health service, he is promised that the level of resources will rise commensurately with the massive scale of the task to which he is committed.

      "body": "<p>With many young, single women facing motherhood while living in hostels for the homeless, a report this week reveals confusion among agencies there to help them - and explodes the myth that the easy way for a teenager to get council housing is to become a mum. </p> <p>One in four women residents of London hostels in the 16 to 24 age range was pregnant last year, says the report by Health Action for Homeless People, part of the charity Crisis. Launched yesterday by Tessa Jowell, minister for women, the report says that with most such women choosing not to have an abortion, their problems are compounded by wrangles over accommodation when the baby is due. Some hostels evict women late in their pregnancy; staff at other hostels have to go to court to force local authorities to fulfil their duty to house single mums-to-be. </p> <p>Some councils put these women in B&amp;Baccommodation, a stop-gap arrangement which often lasts months. This compounds the problems of women who may have ended up in hostels because of abuse and neglect within their own families, and raises the odds that infants brought up in such circumstances will ultimately be taken into care. </p> <p>At the heart of the muddle lies confusion over what hostels should be doing. The report, Homeless Young Woman and Pregnancy, says hostels should adopt policies on the provision of information, advice, support and training for residents. This would cover sexual health (condoms should be provided), rela tionships (fathers-to-be should be allowed to stay the night); self-esteem (often low among female hostel residents), and on parenting. \"It would be helpful if managers clarified for staff what their role is in relation to these issues, and offered ongoing support to project workers who are dealing with the stressful circumstances of their tenants,\" the report suggests. </p> <p>The government should make a commitment to ending the use of bed-and-breakfast facilities for pregnant women with young children, the report argues. Local housing authorities, for their part, should accept that young women who are pregnant and homeless, including those in hostels, are priority cases from the time an accommo- dation request is made. </p> <p>There needs to be more cooperation between housing authorities and hostels; and councils should draw up plans over the next three years to provide semi-supported accommodation for young single mothers. Social services are called on to make \"prompt and proper\" assessments of the needs of these vulnerable mothers-to-be, recognising that long waits and uncertainty adds to their stress. </p> <p>Shaks Ghosh, Crisis's chief executive, says: \"A future without hope can destroy an already low sense of self-worth and this is when the risk of pregnancy becomes very real.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Homeless Young Women and Pregnancy is available at \u00a36 from Health Action for Homeless People on 020-7655 8392</p>",

      "bodyText": "With many young, single women facing motherhood while living in hostels for the homeless, a report this week reveals confusion among agencies there to help them - and explodes the myth that the easy way for a teenager to get council housing is to become a mum. One in four women residents of London hostels in the 16 to 24 age range was pregnant last year, says the report by Health Action for Homeless People, part of the charity Crisis. Launched yesterday by Tessa Jowell, minister for women, the report says that with most such women choosing not to have an abortion, their problems are compounded by wrangles over accommodation when the baby is due. Some hostels evict women late in their pregnancy; staff at other hostels have to go to court to force local authorities to fulfil their duty to house single mums-to-be. Some councils put these women in B&amp;Baccommodation, a stop-gap arrangement which often lasts months. This compounds the problems of women who may have ended up in hostels because of abuse and neglect within their own families, and raises the odds that infants brought up in such circumstances will ultimately be taken into care. At the heart of the muddle lies confusion over what hostels should be doing. The report, Homeless Young Woman and Pregnancy, says hostels should adopt policies on the provision of information, advice, support and training for residents. This would cover sexual health (condoms should be provided), rela tionships (fathers-to-be should be allowed to stay the night); self-esteem (often low among female hostel residents), and on parenting. \"It would be helpful if managers clarified for staff what their role is in relation to these issues, and offered ongoing support to project workers who are dealing with the stressful circumstances of their tenants,\" the report suggests. The government should make a commitment to ending the use of bed-and-breakfast facilities for pregnant women with young children, the report argues. Local housing authorities, for their part, should accept that young women who are pregnant and homeless, including those in hostels, are priority cases from the time an accommo- dation request is made. There needs to be more cooperation between housing authorities and hostels; and councils should draw up plans over the next three years to provide semi-supported accommodation for young single mothers. Social services are called on to make \"prompt and proper\" assessments of the needs of these vulnerable mothers-to-be, recognising that long waits and uncertainty adds to their stress. Shaks Ghosh, Crisis's chief executive, says: \"A future without hope can destroy an already low sense of self-worth and this is when the risk of pregnancy becomes very real.\" \u0095 Homeless Young Women and Pregnancy is available at \u00a36 from Health Action for Homeless People on 020-7655 8392",

Earlier this month, it staged the first, three-day Kilburn arts festival.

This pot of government money is more usually devoted to training, employment, health, housing, capital improvement and attracting inward investment. But SRB cash underwrote the Kilburn event to the grand sum of \u00a3115,700. And even more is promised for an equivalent festival in 2001: over the two years together, up to \u00a3264,000 is being made available. </p> <p>The rationale of this is that the disparate communities of Kilburn, coming from the boroughs of Camden and Brent and straddling the Kilburn High Road, will be brought together under the all-embracing banner of regeneration.

Although the festival lasted only three days, the intention is that work towards these objectives will be continued all year round in community programmes. </p> <p>This year's festivities showcased the work of local groups and businesses and, in doing so, promoted the local arts and entertainment sector.

Glenda Jackson, Labour MP for Hampstead and Highgate, holds a monthly surgery in Kilburn. She says: \"For a time, Kilburn has been seen as a danger area. The SRB money will go a long way to improving things and the festival was an ideal opportunity for Kilburn to celebrate its diversity.\" </p> <p>For Fiona Kilkelly, festival director, a great strength of the event was its rooting in the local community. \"Wherever possible we engaged local performers and involved local businesses,\" she says.

I had applied to study politics and really wanted to go to Nottingham.</p> <p>\"I was very excited when they made me a conditional offer but then they said they\u0092d made a mistake - they wrote and asked if I\u0092d consider a new European Union course instead. There was nothing about it in the prospectus and I really wasn\u0092t sure so I said no. So I accepted conditional offers from Leeds and Sheffield. I needed three Bs and got an A and two Cs. When both universities said they couldn\u0092t take me I panicked, but Mum was really calm and sent me out to buy the newspaper with all the clearing tables. </p> <p>\"I rang all the old universities and eventually started on the old polys, but Mum said stick with the ones you really want. So I rang Nottingham. The politics department admissions tutor said they only had places left... on a new course called European Union studies! He explained the course was very similar to politics and I could do German too. I really should\u0092ve found out about it sooner!

So I changed my mind again! </p> <p>\"Before the results came out I looked around universities in the Midlands - London was just too big.

But then Ucas told me that if I got the points I would have to take the place. I\u0092ve never really been very interested in IT and only applied because I was undecided, so a friend and I pulled out and waited for clearing. I wanted to do something I enjoyed. </p> <p>\"When clearing came around I ended up taking a place to do computing at Westminster. Then I changed my mind and my degree a couple more times! I wanted to be happy with my choice - I didn\u0092t want to get half way through and drop out, so I took social sciences.</p> <p>\"My friend stuck with the computer course but is now unhappy and is thinking about dropping out. In hindsight I made the right decision changing when I did.</p> <p>\"Clearing is perfectly easy if you prepare yourself and do some research.

If you plan you won\u0092t need to make decisions on instinct. </p> <p>\"The biggest hurdle everybody faces is the engaged tone - you need to get to the phones early and persevere, else you could miss out on a course. I went down to my local library as soon as the results came out because they had the paper and prospectuses there. I had to wait 40 minutes before I got through to Westminster but I had my place by midday.

They both wanted 20 A-level points, but I only got 18, and as it was the year before tuition fees were implemented - both oversubscribed and couldn\u0092t give me a place. I was gutted. I\u0092d been prepared though and had bought a paper earlier that morning - just in case! </p> <p>\"I looked up all the unis which still had places for pharmacology and Southampton grabbed my attention. I got through to them first time and they said I should come to visit and see if I liked it. I did both so I handed in my Ucas clearing form to the department.</p> <p>\"It was a relief - I hadn\u0092t planned on not going to university that September and don\u0092t know what I would\u0092ve done otherwise. I was given advice by my school to take any place at clearing just so I could go to uni, but there was nothing else I wanted to do. Go for the course you want to do. It\u0092s also important to go to look around and don\u0092t just choose a course out of desperation. Now I\u0092ve got one of only 30 places in the country to study audiology so coming through clearing has never held me back academically.

I hadn\u0092t backed myself up with a decent insurance offer of three Cs. </p> <p>\"The night before the results came out I went to the pub with all my friends. We decided that it would be a good idea to camp in tents on the school field, so we\u0092d be there the next morning. The police visited us twice during the night and the next morning the teachers came out to have a look but none of them minded too much! It was unnerving when I got my results because I wasn\u0092t quite sure what to do. I\u0092d read all the leaflets but hadn\u0092t really considered clearing.</p> <p>\"So we all went back to the pub. After one drink I called my Mum who metaphorically slapped me around the face because I wasn\u0092t doing anything about clearing. So I went back down to school where there were teachers around to help. I checked all the courses that did philosophy and politics and I saw that Sussex had a place. I knew that it was my friend\u0092s first choice and I trusted his judgement so I took a leap of faith and rang. </p> <p>\"Before you can take your place through clearing you must be released from your original choices. LSE, my second choice, released me immediately but Warwick, my first choice, took four days. Luckily Sussex still had the place and so I applied for my clearing form and sent it off to them. It was all fairly stressful, but I had a fair amount of help from my family and teachers and the formal part of the process was fairly clear.</p> <p>\"My best piece of advice was from my Mum who told me to get off my arse and do something.

Lords Justices Nourse, Kennedy and Rix dismissed Mr Fayed's appeal that Mr Straw had been biased when he refused Mr Fayed citizenship and his decision should be quashed. Michael Beloff QC, representing Mr Fayed, had told the court of appeal that Mr Straw did not treat his client's application for citizenship \"with an open mind\" when he refused it on the grounds that he was not satisfied that Mr Fayed was of \"good character\". Mr Straw had based his views on two events - Mr Fayed's admitted presence when the safe deposit box belonging to his business rival Tiny Rowland was opened and his payment of money to MPs to ask questions on his behalf in the House of Commons. Lord Justice Nourse, giving his judgment today, said of the deposit box break-ins: \"The home secretary's view was that it constituted more than a minor blemish on Mr Al Fayed's character and that it 'illustrated' a serious want of probity on his part; in other words, that it was indicative of a general defect in his character. \"In my judgment it is plain that that was a view which could reasonably be taken in the circumstances and, once taken, that that in itself was enough to justify the home secretary's inability to be satisfied that Mr Al Fayed was of good character.\" The judges refused permission to take the case to the House of Lords. Mr Fayed said in a statement after the ruling: \"While I am disappointed with the decision I am not surprised. \"The establishment and judiciary have long shown bias against me unlike the majority of the great British public who have been nothing but supportive. \"My legal advisers are reviewing the situation.\"",

      "body": "<p>Housing minister Nick Raynsford this week set out his vision of a reformed, lower-cost rental market with potential tenants becoming consumers with a wide variety of choices, rather than recipients of welfare. </p> <p>Bolstered with an extra \u00a31.6bn for social housing by 2003-04, and the prospect of up to 100,000 new, affordable homes in areas of high demand, Raynsford spoke of a radical overhaul of the way housing is delivered to offer \"quality and choice\" to people on low and average incomes. </p> <p>Outlining his radical plan, the minister insisted that competition for social housing underpinned his revolution for affordable properties. \"We've left behind the 20th century framework where, on the whole, the ethos was based on assumptions that the state would provide and people should be grateful for being allocated the benefit of a home,\" he said. \"We're moving to a century where people in housing, as in every other field of their life, want to exercise some choice and not be told you can have this on a take it or leave it basis.\" </p> <p>His comments will be underlined tomorrow in a major report from the Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) - the result of a year-long study by leading housing experts - which calls for a reinvention of social housing under a \"community homes\" label and more private investment to match public resources. </p> <p>It suggests the national adoption of a \"gold award\" scheme, being pioneered by Irwell Valley Housing Association in Greater Manchester, which rewards tenants who pay rent on time and keep to tenancy agreements. This includes special bonuses as well as discounts for insurance, household goods, and other services. </p> <p>With the government now pledged to tackling a \u00a319bn repairs backlog in council housing within 10 years, Raynsford told the Guardian that ministers were determined to ensure a radical overhaul of the way services are delivered with a wider range of social housing providers. </p> <p>To meet the repairs backlog, this means driving through the transfer of council houses to housing associations, special trusts and new social companies. So far, 450,000 have been hived off in England alone - with a further 165,000 likely to go in this financial year - although 3.2m properties remain in council hands. </p> <p>John Perry, policy director of the Institute of Housing, said the government could quite clearly meet its 10-year repairs target provided 200,000 homes are annually transferred from council ownership - thus allowing the new landlords to borrow on the open market to fund a massive improvement programme. Birmingham, England's largest social landlord, is negotiating with Whitehall in the hope of transferring its 90,000 properties to a series of community companies over the next year or so. </p> <p>But contrary to earlier expectations, councils keen to hang on to their housing stock will be allowed to form new hands-off companies - also with powers to borrow on the open market - provided they are approved by a new national housing inspectorate. More than 20 councils have now told the government they want to go down this route. </p> <p>Raynsford insisted he was determined to avoid the creation of new \"monopoly landlords\" once houses were transferred. \"There'll be more choice. We want competition between the providers of social housing and choice in terms of lettings and allocations. People should be able to go to a source of housing... and told not simply where they're going to be allocated, but should be free to express a choice.\"</p>",

Bolstered with an extra \u00a31.6bn for social housing by 2003-04, and the prospect of up to 100,000 new, affordable homes in areas of high demand, Raynsford spoke of a radical overhaul of the way housing is delivered to offer \"quality and choice\" to people on low and average incomes. Outlining his radical plan, the minister insisted that competition for social housing underpinned his revolution for affordable properties. \"We've left behind the 20th century framework where, on the whole, the ethos was based on assumptions that the state would provide and people should be grateful for being allocated the benefit of a home,\" he said. \"We're moving to a century where people in housing, as in every other field of their life, want to exercise some choice and not be told you can have this on a take it or leave it basis.\" His comments will be underlined tomorrow in a major report from the Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) - the result of a year-long study by leading housing experts - which calls for a reinvention of social housing under a \"community homes\" label and more private investment to match public resources. It suggests the national adoption of a \"gold award\" scheme, being pioneered by Irwell Valley Housing Association in Greater Manchester, which rewards tenants who pay rent on time and keep to tenancy agreements. This includes special bonuses as well as discounts for insurance, household goods, and other services. With the government now pledged to tackling a \u00a319bn repairs backlog in council housing within 10 years, Raynsford told the Guardian that ministers were determined to ensure a radical overhaul of the way services are delivered with a wider range of social housing providers. To meet the repairs backlog, this means driving through the transfer of council houses to housing associations, special trusts and new social companies. So far, 450,000 have been hived off in England alone - with a further 165,000 likely to go in this financial year - although 3.2m properties remain in council hands. John Perry, policy director of the Institute of Housing, said the government could quite clearly meet its 10-year repairs target provided 200,000 homes are annually transferred from council ownership - thus allowing the new landlords to borrow on the open market to fund a massive improvement programme. Birmingham, England's largest social landlord, is negotiating with Whitehall in the hope of transferring its 90,000 properties to a series of community companies over the next year or so. But contrary to earlier expectations, councils keen to hang on to their housing stock will be allowed to form new hands-off companies - also with powers to borrow on the open market - provided they are approved by a new national housing inspectorate. More than 20 councils have now told the government they want to go down this route. Raynsford insisted he was determined to avoid the creation of new \"monopoly landlords\" once houses were transferred. \"There'll be more choice. We want competition between the providers of social housing and choice in terms of lettings and allocations. People should be able to go to a source of housing... and told not simply where they're going to be allocated, but should be free to express a choice.\"",

      "body": "<p>On screen three in Star City, a bride-to-be breaks into song. With a wiggle of her hips, replicated by the 30 or so dancers behind her, she sways with just a hint of sensuality, leaving the gushing water fountains that surround her to do the rest. On screen 13, a transsexual is finding love, identity and homophobia in the American midwest with the help of vicious beatings and a gruesome inspection of her genitalia. On screen 19, John Cusack is having trouble with commitment and mulling over the direction his life is taking to a breezy soundtrack spanning three decades of pop. </p> <p>In this 30-screen multiplex cinema on the outskirts of Birmingham globalised culture has been carved into celluloid slots and sold with popcorn. Bichoo, Boys Don't Cry and High Fidelity are just a few of the films showing within a few hundred metres of each other, but those who are watching exist alongside each other as in a parallel universe. This is where Hollywood meets Bollywood (to which six screens have been dedicated) and where different ethnicities congregate but rarely coalesce - a segregated experience within an integrated space. </p> <p>Star City announces itself with a swirl of neon and a 30ft model of Batman, standing tall against a backdrop of the brownfield suburban desolation just off the A47. Its opening last week was as surreal as its appearance. Far away from the red carpets of Leicester Square, accompanied by the roar of traffic on the nearby Spaghetti Junction and the shrieks of adoring women, George Clooney arrived for the premiere of The Perfect Storm. Geographically, Star City may be only a few miles from Birmingham, but economically and culturally it occupies a territory all its own. It is the largest multiplex in Britain, an enormous commercial monument to the disparate, competing and, at times, contradictory forces that are shaping British culture. </p> <p>From abroad comes the inexorable drift towards Americana; from home come the commercial and cultural influences of our own multi-ethnicity. The American influence goes way beyond Clooney and Gotham City's favourite son to the site itself, which already houses sev eral restaurants, bars and a megabowl and, when completed, will include a huge gym as well. By that stage it will be not be a multiplex but a leisure park. An opportunity to spend at every turn. \"You don't think it's going to be too expensive when you set out,\" says Gavin Palmer, who came to see Chicken Run with his two boys. \"But by the time you've bought the popcorn and cokes before you go in, had a go on the computer games when you come out and then had a Burger King it soon adds up. They love it so it's great, but it's more like going to the funfair than going to the cinema really.\" </p> <p>This is not just a huge indoor shopping centre but a signifier of an all-embracing philosophy with its roots in the US, whereby retail provides the starting point for much of human interaction. \"If the shopping centre becomes a place that not only provides suburbanites with their physical living requirements, but simultaneously serves their civic, cultural and social community needs,\" said Victor Gruen, the man who built the first mall in Minnesota in 1956, \"it will make a most significant contribution to the enrichment of our lives.\" </p> <p>This puts going to the cinema on a par with going to a football match or a demonstration. It is a mass, anonymous experience. Projections for Star City's Warner Village cinema are that it should attract 1.5m visitors per year - more than 4,000 a day. </p> <p>While malls are nowhere near as prevalent here as they are in the US, they will none the less soon dominate our consumer culture. It is only 24 years since Britain got its first air-conditioned mall in Brent Cross, north London. Today the top three retail sites in Britain, judged by turnover and profitability per square foot, are all malls - the MetroCentre in Gateshead, Meadowhall, near Sheffield, and Merry Hill in the West Midlands. Oxford Street came 11th and Princes Street in Edinburgh 12th. And while public transport is available Star City is built for the car, as is the case in most of the US. </p> <p>The building was designed by US architect Jon Jerde a man with a portfolio that reads like a roll call of the world's more flamboyant malls, including the Universal City Walk in Los Angeles, Canal City Hakarta in Japan and the Fremont experience in Las Vegas. The huge counters selling ice creams and popcorn bear the names not of British or Indian stars but Americans - Errol Flynn, Humphrey Bogart and Clint Eastwood. The huge murals inside the foyer were hand-painted in California and then shipped to Britain. </p> <p>The Asian influence is far more subtle. For several years now Bollywood films have attracted a huge following in Britain. We are now the biggest export market for Bollywood. There are cinemas dedicated to Bollywood films all over the country, from Glasgow to Southall. Over the last two years four Indian films - Dil Se, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Biwi Number One and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam - have broken box-office records and entered the UK top 20 on release. Last month the Indian equivalent of the Oscars was held in the Dome, hosted by the Indian Miss World, Yukta Mookhey. The most popular foreign location for filming Bollywood films outside India is Scotland. </p> <p>Central to their attraction is that with no sex, only cartoonish violence, simple plots and plenty of dancing, they span generations. No ethical quandaries here. Good always triumphs over evil; love always conquers all.\"When a Bollywood film is on it becomes a real family outing,\" says Andy Stone, the manager of the Warner Village cinema. \"Mum, dad, grandma, the kids - they all come along. The films have very traditional values which make for proper family entertainment.\" </p> <p>There are few areas where this would be a bigger hit than Birmingham, where Asians comprise 14% of the population. With Star City hoping to provide a day out for people from Leicester, Derby, Nottingham and Wolverhampton, which also have large Asian populations, there is plenty of scope to expand. \"I'm amazed it took them so long,\" says Manjit Singh, visiting Star City with his wife, mother and three children. \"There's so much money in Indian films and none of the big names were really taking advantage of it. We used to go sometimes to one of the cinemas in town or watch videos at home. But this seems much better. There's more for everyone to do. More of an atmosphere.\" </p> <p>Bollywood has started to respond to its British audience in kind. While the films at Star City are in Hindi, subtitles are becoming more widespread; films, well known for being epic in length, are getting shorter; and many of the actors and storylines are becoming more western in their orientation. </p> <p>But it is the area's industrial history, rather than its ethnic diversity, that convinced Jerde that this small patch of the depressed Midlands was an ideal venue for his latest creation. \"Birmingham's rich tradition as the birthplace of the industrial revolution has shaped Star City - a new generation of urban entertainment. Nearby masonry and steel warehouse buildings and transportation canals have been an inspiration for the design of the project.\" </p> <p>None of this is obvious to the naked eye, but even Jerde's aspiration tells a tale. Built on the site of a former power station, Star City stands as a marker of the shifts that are taking place in the British economy; a thriving service industry is taking the place of ailing heavy industry. A culture of consumption is taking over from a tradition of production. </p> <p>In truth, were it not for the accents, you would have little idea that you were anywhere near Birmingham. The mall is embossed with a collection of national and global imprints. Burger King, Warner Bros, Baskin Robbins, New Orleans, Nando's, MVC, Megabowl, Books etc and a New Orleans Restaurant. These are brands you can see everywhere, which gives you the sense that you could be anywhere. You are essentially divorced from any definite sense of place. Consumption has not only replaced production; it has trumped location. The consumers may be diverse, but the outlets are standardised. </p> <p>Back in the mall the parallel universes remain equidistant and shows few signs of converging. None of the white people that the Guardian spoke to there were aware that the multiplex even showed Bollywood films. That is not surprising. For, while the Warner Brothers may have discovered a niche market in Bollywood that has drawn more Asians to Star City, there seems scant evidence that anyone else has spotted a business opportunity in directing their trade specifically towards the large number of Asians that come here. Of the several posters advertising films in the entrance of the multiplex, none is for Bollywood movies. There is not even an Indian restaurant, let alone an ambala sweet store or a sari shop. </p> <p>It shows how much more there is to integration than geography. Like Birmingham itself there are a lot of people of different ethnicities - Asian, Afro-Caribbean, and white British - milling around. They knock down skittles in adjacent lanes at the megabowl, eat at adjoining tables in Burger King and stand one behind the other in the queues for tickets, hotdogs and ice cream. But with the exception of the odd mixed-race couple or mixed group of teens, there is very little interaction between them. There are no non-Asian people watching the Bollywood films - not surprising, given that they are in Hindi - and only a handful of Asians going to watch Hollywood films. What interaction there is is between whites and Asians or whites and Afro-Caribbeans, but very rarely between Afro-Caribbeans and Asians. Old women in saris walk past young women in short skirts as though invisible to each other. Divided by ethnicity; united by consumption.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A British Airways Concorde took off from London's Heathrow airport today - less than 24 hours after one of the supersonic aircraft crashed in Paris killing 113 people. BA took the decision to go ahead with the flight to New York after carrying out extensive checks overnight on its fleet. \"We have complete confidence in our Concorde aircraft and we believe there is no technical, safety or operational evidence to suggest that Concorde should not operate safely into the future,\" said BA's customer services and operations director Mike Street. Today's flight was believed to be half full. A least one passenger opted for a subsonic flight in the wake of the crash, but many more turned down offers of a refund or alternative flights. BA had cancelled its two evening Concorde services last night in the immediate aftermath of yesterday's crash of an Air France Concorde moments after take-off from Paris. All 100 passengers and nine crew on board the flight were killed. The plane had been chartered by a German tour operator and was taking tourists to New York to link up with a cruise ship. Four people on the ground were killed when the plane crashed in the grounds of a hotel in Gonesse just outside Paris. Alice Brooking, 21, a student from Hildenborough, near Tonbridge, in Kent, managed to escape from the first floor of the hotel. She told London's Evening Standard: \"I just keep saying to myself over and over again: 'I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive'.\" Air France said today that it would not be flying its Paris-New York Concorde services, but BA confirmed that it was business as usual less than one hour before the first Concorde of the day - BA001 from Heathrow to New York - was due to leave. Mr Street said: \"BA's first concern is always safety. All our aircraft are subject to continuing and exhaustive safety checks. \"We have complete confidence in our Concorde aircraft.

Mr Street added: \"Meantime, our thoughts and sympathies remain with our colleagues at Air France, and those involved in this tragedy. We have been in touch with Air France regularly since yesterday's tragedy and offered any assistance we can provide.\" BA operates four Concordes a day between London and New York. The other America-bound supersonic flight leaves Heathrow at 7pm. The two flights which depart from New York's John F. Kennedy airport take off at 8.30am and 5.25pm US time, landing in London at 5.25pm and 10.25pm British time respectively. Speaking at Heathrow today where he was checking in for the supersonic London-New York flight with BA, Brian Pople, 60, said he was determined to fly on Concorde. He went on: \"Lightning doesn't strike twice. From what I can see on the news it was probably something that happened on the ground. There was nothing wrong with its design. They've been using them long enough. It's only happened once in 30 years.\" Electrical contractor Mr Pople, from Watford in Hertfordshire, was travelling to the US with his wife Wendy for a five-day break. But the president of US TV network CNBC told how he could not face the emotional ordeal of a flight back to New York on Concorde. Bill Bolster, 56, who transferred to a subsonic flight, said: \"This is nothing to do with anything other than an emotional response. I am going to satisfy my emotions and go on another plane. \"I have total confidence in the engineers and pilot of this Concorde but I just can't face it.\"",

It was the first serious accident involving Concorde, which has been flying for 30 years. The Queen has sent messages of sympathy to the French president, Jacques Chirac, and the German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der.

He spent years trying to come up with an idea for a sequel and couldn't.

All the questions we have about why someone ended up as they did are answered - although perhaps not in the way we expected them to be. </p> <p>Christopher Bigsby is the author of Hester: A Romance, a prequel to Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter. Bigsby says he wrote the book because Hawthorne's original left certain mysteries open and he wanted to know the answers to the various questions that were implied but never answered. He admits Hawthorne himself probably wouldn't have come up with the same solution, but says that isn't a problem. \"I'm working with characters given to me,\" he says. \"And I'm trying to be consistent. I'm not damaging or destroying the existing book. If anything I'm doing this out of respect for it. It could bring others to the original.\" </p> <p>Bringing people back to the original could be said of all prequels, not least John Updike's Gertrude and Claudius. Updike's not scared of taking on established characters and giving them a past, though it may not be the one Shakespeare had in mind. And the book may surprise some, as it more or less absolves Claudius of guilt. </p> <p>\"Putting aside the cover-up of the murder,\" Updike writes in his afterword - although surely the point of Hamlet is that you can't just \"put aside\" that murder - \"Claudius seems a capable king, Gertrude a noble queen, Ophelia a treasure of sweetness, Polonius a tedious but not evil counsellor, Laertes a generic young man. Hamlet pulls them all into death.\" </p> <p>With Gertrude and Claudius, Updike is practising something that has lately been much in the news - spinning. By creating a new \"back story\" to the play, he can start the characters off however he wants. All he has to do is make sure the book ends ready for Shakespeare's play to begin. One of the most famous prequels - Wide Sargasso Sea, a prequel to Jane Eyre - similarly plays with Charlotte Bront\u00eb's characters, explaining why the first Mrs Rochester went mad. </p> <p>As an author, Louise Doughty knows all about characterisation. When she writes a book, she gives all her personalities a past. She knows what they look like, what school they went to and what their past relationships were, even if not much of it emerges in the finished product. But she's not sure whether the author retains ownership of that past. \"I would be interested to see what someone would do if they created a prequel to one of my books,\" she says. \"But I think you have to accept that anyone who reads your books is going to create their own back story. Whenever you read a novel, you have your own ideas about who those characters are, your own perception of something as basic as what they look like. So I would have no complaint about someone else coming up with their version. But that's all it would be, a version of what I would have written. There's no way it could stay true to my ideas.\" </p> <p>That's not true, of course, when it comes to Star Wars. George Lucas has always kept jealous control of his creation and provided the most famous cinema prequel of all, The Phantom Menace. Filming on the second of the three prequels is now under way in Australia and fans desperate for any titbit of information are kept updated daily by hundreds of websites. </p> <p>Science fiction seems to be ahead of everyone else when it comes to prequels. Isaac Asimov's Foundation Series joins Star Wars, as does Christopher Tolkien's version of his father's Lord of the Rings. In August, Brian Herbert releases the second of his three prequels to his father's Dune series. Erin Gill, of the Forbidden Planet chain, which specialises in science-fiction memorabilia, says this is because the genre has no rules. \"You can create any world you want,\" she says. \"You can go backwards and forwards, inner space or outer, and that suits the fans. They want to be able to use their imagination, to go into a different world from this one.\" </p> <p>Tony Watts is not convinced that prequel-making has anything to do with imagination. He's spent 30 years in the film industry, setting up, among other things, the Toronto film festival, and says prequels are just a money-making exercise. \"There's a paucity of fresh ideas in Hollywood,\" he says. \"So if you can go to a franchise you know and do the beginning, the early days, then that's another way to get the audiences in. And that's what Hollywood cares about. It's a business.\" </p> <p>Brian Levant is convinced that prequels are now as viable a storytelling medium as sequels. \"I believe you're going to see them now in the Batman movies, maybe the Superman movies,\" he says. \"What else is Superboy, if not a prequel? It's as legitimate a device as what happens next.\" </p> <p>Legitimate or not, Hollywood appears to be going down the prequel route. There are, apparently, plans for an Exorcist prequel, as well as talk of another Jack Ryan adventure. Yet with Harrison Ford now said to be too old to play the role of the CIA man, Ben Affleck is being touted - thus turning the new film into a prequel. But the Blair Witch team is having the best of both worlds. Blair Witch 2 is a sequel, but the last of the trilogy will be a prequel. And that should satisfy the legions of fans desperate to find out how the horror began. </p> <p>Sarah Ebner is a reporter for Newsnight.</p>",

Only a few years before Sir Frank Worrell led the Windies did a professional, Sir Len Hutton, captain the England side. Yet now I hear talk of a return of amateurs, at least to the English county cricket game. Discrimination follows strange cycles, perhaps like that of facial hair. As Sir Tom Stoppard points out in \"New Found Land\", it was fashionable in the reign of King George V to have a big beard; now it is a sign of being respectable if you are clean-shaven.",

Gavaskar has been frequently dogged by match-fixing allegations and his locker at Bombay Gymkhana was recently forced open, allegedly disclosing a large amount of hard currency.

Cricket has made him incredibly rich. </p> <p> Azhar's wealth, though, cannot be explained by income from cricket. Recently, an Indian cricketer declared a vast sum of money during a tax amnesty, and although the cricketer's identity has not been officially revealed, it is widely held to be Azhar, even before the revelation in an Australian TV documentary that Azhar's wealth was $US50 million. This is a sum surely beyond Azhar's star status, acumen, and the pulling power of his not-that-successful Bollywood actress wife.

But for Bhoyrul and Hipwell, a rough-looking 34 and 32 respectively, the timing could not have been better. They are out and about promoting their new book, Make a Million in Twelve Months. So when the exotic-sounding Gay Wisbey, director of the markets and exchanges division at the FSA , said her officials would be having a word in the right ears about tightening the rules governing the financial affairs of business journalists, these two chancers can rightly claim to have made their mark, albeit unwittingly. </p> <p>The book itself took two weeks to write - 150 pages apiece - and reads as such. \"Well, it's just a laugh,\" says Bhoyrul, \"it's for Mirror readers, not your sophisticated types.\" </p> <p>If fact, it is just a bad joke, which kicks off with the italicised front cover claim of \"We did!\" alongside the Make a Million challenge. </p> <p>No, they haven't. The two men are now on Mohamed Al Fayed's payroll as Punch columnists, while working on other unspecified projects for the great Egyptian entrepreneur. They claim to be earning more than they did as Mirror hacks, but Hipwell still hasn't been able to clear an \u00a318,000 legal bill sitting at City lawyers Taylor Joynson Garrett since the Slicker affair. Bhoyrul is still clearly trying to get his head round the fact that at the Mirror, through his own dubious share dealings, he struggled to make even a tenth of the money (\u00a320,000) his editor, Morgan, made on the one stock market trade that got him in deep, hot water. </p> <p>The share dealing concerned a computer company called Viglen, controlled by Amstrad boss Sir Alan Sugar. Mr Morgan bought the stock just before the Slickers puffed the company in their daily column, which in turn had the share price-moving influence that comes when tens of thousands of Mirror readers rush out and buy a particular stock on one day. </p> <p>Bhoyrul is threatening a book dedicated to the affair, under the working title A Tip Too Far, before he returns to his native Mauritius. </p> <p>\"I'm looking at doing another magazine launch and the book, but then it's more than likely I'll go back. I'm not going to work on newspapers again. </p> <p>\"In a year's time I would like to be settled with kids. I've been very lucky. At 34 I have done everything you could want to do in journalism. I would like to run a little bar on the beach. It's too stressful round here.\" </p> <p>Hipwell, conversely, is not at all sure what he is going to do. He likes Punch, but a recently diagnosed kidney complaint means he will need a transplant at some stage. And, predictably, one or two of his old friends in the Square Mile have already offered to launch a campaign to get Morgan to donate one of his own organs. </p> <p>This book, 300 knocked-off pages that read like a hastily assembled guide to personal finance with one or two limp jokes, is the end of the Slickers partnership. \"I'm sick of it. The Punch column has a natural shelf life and it will probably be the last thing we do together,\" says Hipwell. </p> <p>The sanctuary of Punch was offered by Mr Fayed in the wake of the Mirror scandal, with the Harrods owner presenting his fearless tipsters with \u00a3100,000 and a challenge to turn the money into \u00a31m in the space of 12 months. </p> <p>Five months in and the \u00a3100,000 has shrunk to \u00a370,000. \"We've got seven months left and we'll do it,\" laughs Bhoyrul, before reiterating the Slickers' claim that in their Mirror days they made their readers real money. </p> <p>He points to tip after tip which rocketed after being featured on the Slicker page, but still refuses to face up to the reality that most of these shares later came back to earth like the proverbial stick - with Mirror readers, still holding the shares, left to count their losses. </p> <p>But they have also experienced the wrath of Mirror readers when share prices did not move in the desired direction. \"The abuse and the hate mail you would get was incredible,\" says Hipwell, with Bhoyrul throwing in his view that \"all the readers were tossers. Piers told us that. In fact he said that most couldn't even read.\" </p> <p>Along the way, they have some advice for Susie Jagger, the young financial hack from the Telegraph who broke the original story about Morgan's dealings, and who has been hired by the Mirror from this week to replace the Slickers with her own Susie in the City column. \"We have already told her, 'Don't do it', but now she is she should not take it too seriously and should not get too close to the stock market itself,\" says Hipwell. \"Beware of the readers,\" adds Bhoyrul. \"Make one mistake and she'll get 2,000 calls in the space of five minutes. If a share price goes down, they will be outside her house, threatening to lynch her.\" </p> <p>The book is aimed at what Bhoyrul and Hipwell perceive to be Mirror readers. It throws in some history about the lads' newspaper japes and their alleged extraordinary ability to beat the City at its own game, opening up a mysterious world to the lumpen private investor. It provides a bit of reference material, such as the best investment magazines to read, and also describes a few technical matters, such as how share trades are settled. </p> <p>But there is not much more other than a strange chapter which seems to be an attempt to justify the book's cover title, slugged as a \"Twelve-month guide to a million\". </p> <p>This runs to 10 pages in all and advises the budding stock market speculator to sit on their hands for a couple of months, before branching out, picking a few sure-fire investment winners and then turning the profit into cash. </p> <p>The plan for Month Twelve, for example, is as follows: \"Add up the value of every single share you have, and how much profit you are sitting on.

Sell all your shares, take the cash and enjoy the rest of your life - and never more play the stock market. It will never get this good again.\" </p> <p>Insightful stuff.

The deal effectively brings together two generations of American cinema, as seventies titan Coppola signs up with nineties indie auteur Hartley. But it also suggests that Coppola is increasingly turning his back on film directing in favour of lucrative behind-the-scenes work.</p> <p>The precise nature of Monster's script remains a closely guarded secret, but the Hartley project is believed to offer a wry update on the likes of Beauty and the Beast. Insiders report that the oddball story follows a Manhattan journalist who trails her missing boyfriend to Iceland only to fall under the spell of a mythical snow creature. No cast members have been confirmed, though Hartley regular Robert John Burke (The Unbelievable Truth, Simple Men, Flirt) is rumoured to be on board.</p> <p>Monster will be 40-year-old Hartley's first feature since his underrated <a href=\"http://us.imdb.com/Title?0122529\" target=\"_new\" \">Henry Fool</a> opened in 1998. But Coppola's own work rate has been even more patchy. Since directing Bram Stoker's <a href=\"http://us.imdb.com/Title?0103874\" target=\"_new\" \">Dracula</a> in 1991, the acclaimed creator of <a href=\"http://us.imdb.com/Title?0068646\" target=\"_new\" \">The Godfather</a> and <a href=\"http://us.imdb.com/Title?0078788\">Apocalypse Now</a> has been behind the camera just twice - directing the universally panned Jack in 1995 and the adequate John Grisham adaptation <a href=\"http://us.imdb.com/Title?0119978\" target=\"_new\" \">The Rainmaker</a> in 1997. In the meantime, he has served as an executive producer on Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow and helped produce his daughter Sofia's film debut, <a href=\"http://us.imdb.com/Title?0159097\" target=\"_new\" \">The Virgin Suicides</a>. Coppola was also reported to have had a hand in the editing of this year's failed sci-fi romp Supernova. </p> <p>Monster begins shooting in September in locations around Iceland and New York. It will be produced by Coppola's production company American Zoetrope and distributed by United Artists.</p>",

The precise nature of Monster's script remains a closely guarded secret, but the Hartley project is believed to offer a wry update on the likes of Beauty and the Beast. Insiders report that the oddball story follows a Manhattan journalist who trails her missing boyfriend to Iceland only to fall under the spell of a mythical snow creature. No cast members have been confirmed, though Hartley regular Robert John Burke (The Unbelievable Truth, Simple Men, Flirt) is rumoured to be on board. Monster will be 40-year-old Hartley's first feature since his underrated Henry Fool opened in 1998. But Coppola's own work rate has been even more patchy. Since directing Bram Stoker's Dracula in 1991, the acclaimed creator of The Godfather and Apocalypse Now has been behind the camera just twice - directing the universally panned Jack in 1995 and the adequate John Grisham adaptation The Rainmaker in 1997. In the meantime, he has served as an executive producer on Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow and helped produce his daughter Sofia's film debut, The Virgin Suicides. Coppola was also reported to have had a hand in the editing of this year's failed sci-fi romp Supernova. Monster begins shooting in September in locations around Iceland and New York. It will be produced by Coppola's production company American Zoetrope and distributed by United Artists.",

      "body": "<p>Two new books have given me immense pleasure this week. Before long, I'll actually read them. Despite what they say about not judging a book by its cover, some books demand to be judged by their layout. Among them are debuts by American writers Mark Z Danielewski and Dave Eggers - respectively, House of Leaves (Anchor, \u00a313) and A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius (Picador, \u00a314.99), or AHWOSG, as it says in tiny letters at the top of each page. Both so prominently feature tricks of design that they remind you, at every moment, that they are books, things of paper and print. We think of books as no more than transparent vehicles for meaning, so when a book asserts its bookness, it's as disconcerting as if it carried a big Magritte blurb announcing: \"This Is Not A Book.\" </p> <p>The Eggers volume seems simple enough: an autobiographical piece, largely played straight, typographically speaking, but prefaced by 39 pages of sarcasm in a smaller typeface, offering rules and suggestions, a jokey contents list, a flow chart illustrating the book's themes, and a little drawing of a stapler. And this self-reflexive wrapping extends to parts of the book normally considered off- limits to authors. Eggers has doctored the copyright line to read: \"First published 2000 by Simon and Schuster, a division of a larger and more powerful company called Viacom Inc, which is wealthier and more populous than 18 of the official states of America.\" If you remove the jacket, you find he's even had the cover embossed with a pair of enigmatic aphorisms. </p> <p>Eggers is effectively etching sarcastic graffiti onto his sober slab of text. But that's nothing to what Danielewski does. Rival texts by two narrators (one in the Times font, the other in Courier) consume each other in floods of footnotes; in turn, the two narratives are spiked with musical staves and Derrida-like crossings-out, with print going upside-down, right to left, reversed. Sometimes the text does what it describes: when a passageway gets narrower, so does the printed page; when a rope snaps, the word rope is stretched to breaking until a single letter floats unanchored in a void of white paper. </p> <p>Both books are beautifully executed art objects - as close to avant-garde coffee-table volumes as novels can be. Both have been touted as the hippest new things in print, and yet a few years ago they probably would have been dismissed as outmoded formalist navel-gazing, the sort of masturbatory narcissism that was long ago driven off the shelves by hard-knuckled realism. </p> <p>But every now and then there's a resurgence of books that flaunt themselves, in a tradition going back to the 18th century and Lawrence Sterne's Tristram Shandy, which turned the book into an unruly trick-box of traps and mirrors, customising it with squiggly lines, stars, black pages, pages that looked like marble slabs, and blank chapters. </p> <p>The 60s were a high point for Sternean experiments. The books of French novelist Michel Butor gradually disintegrated to resemble the spaciest Mallarm\u00e9 poems, sometimes in multi-coloured print. Perhaps the ultimate 60s book-as-thing was by novelist BS Johnson: The Unfortunates (1969, recently reissued by Picador), which came as a box of separate sections to be read in random order. There was a spate of 60s science fiction in which the text was gobbled up by computer print-out (Jeff Noon's 1998 novel Nymphomation reactivates this tradition). In the US, John Barth's collection Lost in the Funhouse (1968) contained a one-sentence story in the form of a cut-out-and-glue Moebius strip, and a story featuring so many layers of quoted speech that the page disappears in a swarm of inverted commas. </p> <p>There's nothing new about House of Leaves or AHWOSG. However, typographical fancies were once regarded as a subversive tactic to disrupt narrative, to explode story in a bloodbath of pure signifier. With Danielewski and Eggers, the tactic has entered the narrative mainstream. Both books now look like plausible bestseller material in ways that Butor's or Johnson's never were. Is it that the once sinister and destructive typographical twist has been domesticated? </p> <p>Or is it that innovations in design elsewhere - on the net, on CD sleeves and club flyers, in magazines such as Raygun - are having a knock-on effect on the staidness of the literary page? Two years from now, we may be all tearing our hair and complaining about the extinction of horizontal print. But for now I'm clearing my coffee table - in reality, a slab of marble designed to resemble a page of Tristram Shandy - for more strange works of staggering genius.</p>",

If the government has come near to meeting those considerations, that is acceptable as long as the main thrust of standards legislation is retained.\" In its consultation paper last year, the government said the current regulations were \"incomplete, patchy and have developed in a piecemeal fashion\". A set of national minimum standards will be published later this year, covering staffing, training and other aspects of provision in residential and nursing homes for older people.",

      "body": "<p>Chris Smith, the culture secretary, yesterday unveiled a bold rescue package for the arts, promising millions for the rejuvenation of an arts infrastructure devastated by almost two decades of neglect. </p> <p>The Arts Council will receive an extra \u00a3100m a year from 2003, the biggest increase in funding in its 44-year history. There will be smaller phased increases of \u00a315m and \u00a345m a year before then, with a large portion of the money staunching the near meltdown in regional theatre. </p> <p>The rise is well short of the extra \u00a3100m a year demanded by the council's chairman, Gerry Robinson. But last night Mr Robinson called the settlement \"remarkable\" and described it as a \"step change in the support for the arts\". </p> <p>Mr Robinson said: \"I have looked at the arts sector coolly as a businessman. There's no doubt we have historically underfunded the arts. I am absolutely delighted. We made clear that the government had put down a deposit on the arts in its first spending review and we trusted them to deliver the balance - today they have delivered.\" </p> <p>The move is a personal triumph for Mr Smith, who said that arts funding had now increased by 60% in real terms in five years. </p> <p>Of the funding, in two years' time, \u00a312m will go to reviving the battered regional theatre companies, with an extra \u00a325m the following year. The largest sum - about \u00a340m - will pay for a new Creative Partnerships initiative to bring art, theatre and film to schools and deprived communities.

      "bodyText": "Chris Smith, the culture secretary, yesterday unveiled a bold rescue package for the arts, promising millions for the rejuvenation of an arts infrastructure devastated by almost two decades of neglect. The Arts Council will receive an extra \u00a3100m a year from 2003, the biggest increase in funding in its 44-year history. There will be smaller phased increases of \u00a315m and \u00a345m a year before then, with a large portion of the money staunching the near meltdown in regional theatre. The rise is well short of the extra \u00a3100m a year demanded by the council's chairman, Gerry Robinson. But last night Mr Robinson called the settlement \"remarkable\" and described it as a \"step change in the support for the arts\". Mr Robinson said: \"I have looked at the arts sector coolly as a businessman. There's no doubt we have historically underfunded the arts. I am absolutely delighted. We made clear that the government had put down a deposit on the arts in its first spending review and we trusted them to deliver the balance - today they have delivered.\" The move is a personal triumph for Mr Smith, who said that arts funding had now increased by 60% in real terms in five years. Of the funding, in two years' time, \u00a312m will go to reviving the battered regional theatre companies, with an extra \u00a325m the following year. The largest sum - about \u00a340m - will pay for a new Creative Partnerships initiative to bring art, theatre and film to schools and deprived communities. Again, regional theatres are likely to be among the main beneficiaries. Sir Richard Eyre, former head of the Royal National Theatre, who had grown impatient with government policy, yesterday welcomed the move. \"This at last is promising news. This is also a considerable vote of confidence in Chris Smith. This government came into office saying the arts were at the core of their thinking. This is good news, but I hope it's just the beginning.\" Philip Headley, of the Theatre Royal Stratford East, a tireless critic of successive governments, was delighted by the changes. \"It's really terrific. For the first time I can remember we are being treated like adults and being left to get on with our jobs. My only worry is that the money may come too late for some who have been clinging on by their fingernails.\" Sources close to the government last night stressed that the money would be directed towards rebuilding the arts infrastructure. Jude Kelly, artistic director of the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds, whose education and community programmes inspired Creative Partnerships, said the money was proof that the arts really mattered to the government. \"What it says is that access to arts and creativity is a basic, like health and education,\" she said yesterday Only Sir Peter Hall, the theatre director, was less generous in his praise. \"It is something but more is needed, and it is too late. I just hope there is a regional theatre left by the time the money comes through.\" Speaking from Denver, in the United States, where he is directing a season of work, he said he was relieved to be \"working somewhere where art is valued and properly funded\".

      "body": "<p>A top British judge recommended that farmer Tony Martin should serve a minimum of eight rather than nine years, for shooting dead a teenage burglar at his home, in August last year.</p> <p>Trial judge Mr Justice Owen jailed Martin for life for the murder of 16-year-old Fred Barras, but recommended he serve a nine-year minimum or \"tariff\", according to ITV's Tonight with Trevor MacDonald. But the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Woolf, believes mitigating circumstances mean that he should be considered for release in eight years time, the programme's makers say.</p> <p>Mr Justice Owen made his nine-year recommendation in a report to the home secretary, who is responsible for setting the final tariff.

      "bodyText": "A top British judge recommended that farmer Tony Martin should serve a minimum of eight rather than nine years, for shooting dead a teenage burglar at his home, in August last year. Trial judge Mr Justice Owen jailed Martin for life for the murder of 16-year-old Fred Barras, but recommended he serve a nine-year minimum or \"tariff\", according to ITV's Tonight with Trevor MacDonald. But the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Woolf, believes mitigating circumstances mean that he should be considered for release in eight years time, the programme's makers say. Mr Justice Owen made his nine-year recommendation in a report to the home secretary, who is responsible for setting the final tariff. However, the copy sent to Mr Straw contained hand-written case notes from the Lord Chief Justice, the programme claims. Martin, who was recently moved to Gartree high-security jail in Leicestershire, is currently appealing against his conviction at Norwich crown court. Jurors found him guilty of murder by a 10-2 majority after hearing how he shot Fred Barras, who had attempted to burgle his remote farmhouse in Emneth Hungate, Norfolk. Tonight with Trevor MacDonald's producers say Lord Woolf wrote: \"I note he initially considered fixing the tariff figure at eight years and, on the facts described, that is the figure I would have selected rather than the nine years on which the judge decided.\" A spokesman for Lord Woolf declined to comment on the reports and expressed concern about how the document had been obtained. Mr Justice Owen's report, which was also obtained by the Tonight programme, talks about public sympathy for Martin, who has reportedly had a \u00a360,000 contract placed on his life since the killing. \"Understandably there has been considerable sympathy for Martin who was a man without convictions, whose home was broken into and had it not been for the burglars he would not have committed his crimes,\" the judge is said to have written. \"However, much of that sympathy is based on very inadequate accounts of the evidence. [The burglars] were given no chance to escape and Martin was not acting in reasonable self-defence. He fired intending really serious injury and certainly risked the lives of each of the burglars. He is never likely to re-offend but he deserves punishment,\" he added.",

They were utterly weak, entirely without power, in the face of the great fireball that pulled them out of the clouds and into the ground. They could do nothing except pray or panic.</p> <p>At that same moment, the family of Sarah Payne was inspecting the 80-metre-long cellophane blanket of flowers that has grown in memory of their slain daughter. They were powerless, too: a family who could not save their child. So were the tens of thousands of mourners who had flocked to a Sussex roadside to write cards or light candles for a girl they never knew. From Paris to Pulborough, helpless grief chokes the air.</p> <p>They are far apart, these two moments of calamity. One feels random and unavoidable, a natural disaster; the other an act of deliberate evil. No matter that an aircraft is man-made; the crashing of a Concorde jet seems as arbitrary and amoral as a hurricane or typhoon - an act of God. Think of those two Polynesian students minding their own business, making the beds in the Hotel Lessemo yesterday when, like a thunderbolt from the sky, a jet plane crashed through the window and consumed them in flames. The murder of Sarah is random, too: a little girl who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. But her death was no accident. It was the product of a human decision to do harm - an act of the devil.</p> <p>They are miles apart, yet these catastrophes cry out with a shared message, one we usually strain every sinew to avoid. It is that there are hard, unbreakable limits to our power - that sometimes there is simply nothing we can do.</p> <p>These disasters have more in common than that, of course. For each plays on one of our deepest fears. The prospect of falling to earth has terrified man since he first looked upwards, whether it was Lucifer tumbling out of heaven or Icarus flying too close to the sun. In our own time that fear has sharpened by becoming more real. It is not just the flying-phobics who find the very idea of air travel daunting. There cannot be an air passenger anywhere who has not at least once muttered a private prayer to an unnamed god - just in case.</p> <p>With the Concorde, there is an extra element: call it Titanic syndrome. The fact that the ill-fated aircraft had been admired for three decades as the sleekest, fastest and safest in the skies adds to our sense of vulnerability. For if the plane that would not crash, like the ship that could not sink, hits disaster then what hope is there for the rest of us? The fall of Concorde strikes another mythic note: it is as if man's arrogance in seeking to travel faster than the speed of sound is at last being punished, hubris meeting its nemesis.</p> <p>Sarah's death hit us in a mythic way, too. After all, the child-snatching stranger is a terror of timeless, fairy-tale pedigree. From the big bad wolf in Little Red Riding Hood to the evil-faced \"childcatcher\" in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, our culture is replete with predators whose taste is for children. The statistics insist such cases are extremely rare: somewhere between four and nine a year. Rationally, we know that most of the children who are killed die either on the roads or at the hands of their own parents.</p> <p>And yet it is the rare exception that terrifies us. It is not logical, but it is easy to understand. It stands to reason that, when we learned this week of the horrific case of the Mochrie family in South Wales - where the father had killed his four children, his wife and finally himself - we feel little of the emotion that surged for Sarah. That's because few of us fear that we might one day murder our own children. But we all related to the Payne family. We looked at those parents and imagined ourselves: \"There, but for the grace of God...\"</p> <p>So both the child murder and the plane crash have a folkloric, almost biblical quality. Will they produce the same reaction? It's unlikely. For one thing, harsh though it sounds, an eight-year-old English girl arouses more sympathy than a hundred well-off German tourists. We find it easier to empathise with one story than a hundred and we still imagine the death of an innocent child to be somehow more undeserved than the death of equally innocent adults.</p> <p>Sarah's story exerted a tighter grip for a further reason: it was a real story. For two weeks people held on, hoping against hope that there might be a surprise happy ending. People listened to the news each evening, just in case the little girl lost had been found alive. There was no such drama or suspense in the journey of Flight AF 4590; this story was over as soon as we knew about it.</p> <p>So we are not likely to see a second outpouring of the emotion that has been on display on the banks of the A29 - not for the dead of yesterday's plane crash, at any rate. We will repeat it eventually though. Susie Orbach, the writer and one-time psychotherapist for Princess Diana, suggests that we have now developed a need for these moments of collective feeling. Over successive summers we have come together to mourn Diana, cheer for the England football team and even gaze at the eclipse. \"It's an attempt to form a civil society, since so many of us feel we don't have one anymore,\" says Orbach. The Diana week is the archetype.</p> <p>\"We created a new form of national mourning that week,\" she says: witness the Diana-style cellophane bouquets, the inscriptions, the teddy bears brought out for Sarah. Note, too, the roadside shrines which appear wherever there has been a lethal car accident: miniature Kensington Gardens of flowers and farewell messages.</p> <p>But Concorde will probably not perform the same function; it will not morph into the blank screen Sarah became - on which countless strangers could project their own private pains and losses. Our instinctive horror of helplessness will see to that.</p> <p>With Sarah the feeling of sheer impotence was too powerful to ignore. People know that there will always be men sick enough to want to have sex with and hurt a child - and there is almost nothing one can do. We cannot lock up our children; we cannot hunt down and lock away every child molester. Yet the urge to do something is overwhelming. For the News of the World, that meant naming and shaming 50 or so paedophiles; for some of the paper's readers, it meant circling the home of a man they (wrongly) believed was on the list. But for most people, the urge to act translated into a poem, a candle or a flower.</p> <p>The reaction to Concorde will be different. Those who died on board will have felt utterly powerless. But those of us alive and on the ground can think of plenty to do. We'll run around, talking about new safety procedures, tighter rules and improved designs. We'll act as if there is much we can do to make sure this never happens again. We won't admit for a moment our sheer helplessness.

      "bodyText": "When Concorde - the world's only supersonic commercial aircraft - lifted its exclusive band of inaugural passengers into the sky on January 21 1976, experts predicted that it would be not only the fastest, but also the safest, flight. The futuristic craft, with its distinctive narrow nose and slim lines, was the brainchild of two nations, Britain and France, which had been wrestling for 20 years to create an aircraft that would travel at twice the speed of sound. Pooling their resources in 1962, they had been testing prototypes since March 1969, and, by the time the commercial service was launched, with simultaneous flights from London to Bahrain and Paris to Rio de Janeiro, the plane had been subjected to 5,000 hours of testing, making it the most vetted aircraft in aviation history. Aviation experts at the time also attested to its safety. William Magruder, a test pilot assigned by the US government to assess the plane's safety, insisted: \"It is my opinion - after 30 years of flight testing, designing and engineering airplanes - that this could be the safest airplane ever built.\" Even last night - with its accident-free safety record dramatically shattered a day after it emerged that cracks had appeared in the wings of 11 of the 13 aircraft - the industry appeared not to countenance the idea that the plane was dangerous. Aviation analyst Paul Beaver said: \"Concorde has an excellent safety record and in the last 20 years, it has been doing a sterling job. \"It is an amazing aircraft - it still makes everyone stop and look up - and it's a remarkable sight, designed to fly well and look beautiful.\" The pride of Britain's air fleet, Concorde has always been the preserve of the rich and famous, with the likes of model Claudia Schiffer, the late Diana, Princess of Wales, designer Calvin Klein, and the former Beatles, Paul McCartney and George Harrison, frequently opting to pay the \u00a36,290 to fly from Heathrow to JFK, New York, in around three and a half hours - less than half the usual journey time. Two flights depart each way every day, with one flight each way a day from JFK to Paris Charles de Gaulle. But money has always been a sore point for the Concorde project, which took seven years and \u00a31.5bn to develop. Dubbed the most expensive marketing experiment in history, the plane gave rise the phrase \"Concorde fallacy\" - the term given to the belief that it is a waste of money to end a project once considerable sums have been invested in it. A victim of the first oil crisis in 1973, only 20 were made - instead of the predicted 400 - and these were virtually given by the French and British governments to British Aerospace and Air France. Yet, despite the fleet's age, in the 30 years since Concorde 001, the first prototype, took off from the Aerospatiale airfield in Toulouse, in March 1969, it has remained peerless. While some military planes can meet her cruising speed of 1,350mph at a height of 60,000 feet, none can do so for as long. \"Military pilots can't sustain Mach 2 for two and a half hours,\" said Dave Rowland, an experienced Concorde captain. \"Nobody can do what we do.\"",

They report today that a tiny microbe that also infects humans can persuade a rat into a suicidal attraction to cats. </p> <p>Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan which infects many mammals - and one Briton in five. But like many parasites, it needs a particular class of host in which to complete its life cycle. Toxoplasma gondii is common in rodents, but can only replicate in cats. </p> <p>So, according to Manuel Berdoy, David Macdonald and Joanne Webster, in the latest Proceedings of the the Royal Society, the parasite has to make sure the rat it infects is killed and eaten by a cat. </p> <p>Toxoplasma can cause spontaneous abortion in pregnant women and even birth defects. But it was thought in most cases to have no obvious effect on its human hosts. </p> <p>\"Before I did the original work, all the standard textbooks said it had no effects on rodents either,\" said Dr Webster. \"But it does have subtle effects. It makes them more active and decreases neophobia - fear of novelty - and in this study, decreased fear of cats.\" </p> <p>The scientists set up a wild enclosure for rats, with different smells in each corner. Rats infected by the parasite were attracted to the smell of cat urine. </p> <p>\"It all started because I looked for the reservoir of the parasite in the wild and found that it was about 35% of the rodent population,\" said Dr Webster. \"The very fact that it lives in the host's brain makes it in an ideal position to manipulate behaviour. I started looking to see if there was any behavioural defect that may increase predation rate.\" </p> <p>Rats are suspicious of anything new, which is why they are difficult to trap, but infected rats seemed to lose their neophobia. And a rat attracted to places marked by a prowling cat would make an easy victim. </p> <p>The toxoplasma research might throw light on the parasite's effect on humans. Infection rate in Britain is 22%, but in France - with a greater appetite for rare or undercooked meat - it has reached 84%. The next question is: what does it do to humans? </p> <p>\"These results may explain the reports of altered personality and IQ levels in some humans,\" said Dr Berdoy. Toxoplasma becomes a much more dangerous companion in people whose immune systems have been suppressed. But it remains apparently harmless in most cases.</p>",

But it was thought in most cases to have no obvious effect on its human hosts. \"Before I did the original work, all the standard textbooks said it had no effects on rodents either,\" said Dr Webster. \"But it does have subtle effects. It makes them more active and decreases neophobia - fear of novelty - and in this study, decreased fear of cats.\" The scientists set up a wild enclosure for rats, with different smells in each corner. Rats infected by the parasite were attracted to the smell of cat urine. \"It all started because I looked for the reservoir of the parasite in the wild and found that it was about 35% of the rodent population,\" said Dr Webster. \"The very fact that it lives in the host's brain makes it in an ideal position to manipulate behaviour. I started looking to see if there was any behavioural defect that may increase predation rate.\" Rats are suspicious of anything new, which is why they are difficult to trap, but infected rats seemed to lose their neophobia. And a rat attracted to places marked by a prowling cat would make an easy victim. The toxoplasma research might throw light on the parasite's effect on humans. Infection rate in Britain is 22%, but in France - with a greater appetite for rare or undercooked meat - it has reached 84%. The next question is: what does it do to humans? \"These results may explain the reports of altered personality and IQ levels in some humans,\" said Dr Berdoy. Toxoplasma becomes a much more dangerous companion in people whose immune systems have been suppressed. But it remains apparently harmless in most cases.",

The talks marked the closest the two sides had come to a comprehensive agreement in 52 years of conflict and uneasy cohabitation.

The two leaders also pledged to avoid unilateral actions that would prejudge the outcome of negotiations, a reference to Mr Arafat's threat to declare a state and Israeli counter-threats to annex Jewish settlements on the West Bank.

It was the first time in almost 30 years of service that the supersonic Concorde had suffered a catastrophic failure of its British-built engines. An extraordinary photograph taken by a Hungarian plane spotter on holiday in Paris shows that the aircraft was belching flames even as it left the runway at Charles de Gaulle. Concordes get up to 250mph before lifting off, and there was speculation last night that although an engine had caught fire, the pilot was unable to abort takeoff because the runway was too short to stop. Three minutes after takeoff, with flames shooting hundreds of feet from two of its engines, the Concorde banked left and ploughed nose first into a hotel, demolishing the three-storey structure. The pilot apparently struggled to put the flaming aircraft down in open fields beyond Gonesse, a small industrial town just beyond the runway.

Police blocked off all roads leading to the scene of the crash, backing up traffic on all the rural roads in the farm fields just north-east of the airport.

The victims were mainly Germans on their way to New York to board a cruise liner. There were also two Danes, an Austrian and an American on board. All nine of the crew were French. The passengers comprised 47 men, 50 women and three children. A spokesman in London for Peter Deilmann, the Baltic shipping firm that chartered Concorde, said the passengers were flying out to join the MS Deutschland for a cruise. The authorities in Berlin were not releasing the identities of the passengers last night. Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, Germany's chancellor, cancelled all appointments after hearing news of the crash, while Lionel Jospin, the French prime minster, went to the scene. Within two hours, British Airways announced that it had cancelled its next two Concorde flights. The disaster came days after the news that microscopic cracks had been found in the wings of the Concorde fleet, though Air France stressed last night that there was no connection with the engine problem linked to the crash. All French Concordes were grounded pending the investigation. The black box recorder and voice recorder which may offer clues to the causes of the crash have yet to be recovered. The plane was 20 years old and had flown 12,000 hours. Last night it emerged that the aircraft had just finished a big refit four days ago. Jean Cyril Spinetta, director of Air France said: \"There was a problem with the engines. It has undergone a complete refit for the past year, which finished four days before the accident.\" Concorde, a triumph of the 1960s, was built to fly at twice the speed of sound. But it was always highly uneconomical and only 20 were built. A total of 13 are in service, seven with BA and six with Air France. Rolls-Royce, the builder of the engines for Concorde aircraft, said it was seeking more information on the crash. \"It is premature to speculate,\" a spokesman said.",

      "bodyText": "Max Clifford emerged last night as a secret go-between in the leaking of five Downing Street memos in an act of revenge against New Labour. The high-profile PR man is believed to have placed the confidential letters, including one written by Tony Blair, with Rupert Murdoch's newspapers after they were recovered from rubbish by a mysterious figure known as \"Benji the Binman\". Mr Clifford, who effectively acts as Benjamin Pell's agent, passed on the documents retrieved and pieced together from waste thrown out by Downing Street aides including pollster Philip Gould. Special Branch officers last week suspected a Downing Street insider was to blame for an embarrassing series of leaks over recent months. But the breakthrough came when detectives discovered a Gould memo published last week in the Sun and Times was a first draft ripped up into small pieces and left by the pollster in a black plastic bin bag outside his home in north London. Mr Gould had disposed of the single draft copy and made 49 changes to the document, which warned that the New Labour brand was \"contaminated\", before circulating it to Mr Blair and other senior figures. Many of the changes to the memo were trivial, including new punctuation, but crucial phrases were also changed and new passages added. The leaks rocked the government as they portrayed Labour as a party obsessed with presentation and dominated by a small clique gathered around Mr Blair. They were detonated at crucial moments, overshadowing Gordon Brown's spending plans. Mr Clifford, who played a part in defeating the Tories with his exposure of a string of sex scandals, has fallen out with Labour. He is angry at the government's failure to help the disabled and improve the NHS, and Peter Mandelson, who rang him regularly in opposition, has stopped phoning. Mr Clifford and a senior News International executive last night both publicly maintained that he had played no role in the leaks. Mr Pell could not be contacted last night, but a close associate said off the record that Mr Clifford was involved. Mr Clifford is understood to have used another person last weekend to hand the Blair \"touchstone issues\" memo to Sun and Times journalists. Both papers maintained they did not pay. \"Benji got the memos, Max handed them on. It was not just the money. Benji loves the excitement and Max is unhappy with the government,\" said the associate. Executives on all three Murdoch titles are known to have contacts with Mr Pell, a jobless former trainee solicitor who specialises in raking through the rubbish of the rich and famous. Mr Pell was convicted last November on five counts of \"stealing documentary waste\" from a law firm and the court was told he suffers from an obsessive compulsive personality disorder in the form of a collection mania. Police found at least 200,000 documents in his garden shed. Mr Pell, in his mid-30s, was asked by a source outside News International this year to target the home addresses of Mr Gould and Lord Levy, the Labour fundraiser embarrassed when the Sunday Times recently revealed he paid only \u00a35,000 tax in 1998-99. That source never received any documents. A News International invoice dated June 18 1999, obtained by the Guardian, discloses that the Sunday Times paid Mr Pell \u00a33,375 through account 526631 for three stories - on Jonathan Aitken, James Hewitt and alleged ballot-rigging in Hackney - at the end of April last year.

This was encapsulated by a moment just after the first joint appearance by the leaders. Neither could agree on who should enter the presidential cabin first, both insisting that the other should have precedence. The impasse ended with Mr Barak shoving the protesting Mr Arafat over the threshold.</p> <p>The Palestinians came to the talks only reluctantly, concerned that Mr Arafat might come under combined Israeli-US pressure to make concessions on Jerusalem which would be unacceptable to his own people and the wider Arab world.</p> <p>Progress was made quickly on the other key issues. The Israeli delegation put forward a compromise solution to the question of the 3.6m Palestinian refugees, under which about 100,000 would be allowed to return to the homes they fled in the 1948 and 1967 wars, as part of a family reunification programme.</p> <p>The rest would be compensated from an international fund. The Palestinians made it clear that they were willing to accept that position as a starting point for negotiations.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the sides quickly came to a rough agreement on the the borders of a future Palestinian state, incorporating the Gaza Strip and about 90% of the West Bank. The most densely populated Jewish settlements, with about 80% of the Jewish population on the West Bank, would be annexed by Israel, perhaps in return for territory within Israel itself.</p> <p>The fate of Jerusalem, however, continued to present an obstacle to progress, and failure to make progress on the issue triggered the first breakdown last Wednesday. Mr Arafat insisted that the Palestinians must retain sovereignty over the Islamic holy sites - the Dome of the Rock, the Al-Aqsa mosque and their neighbourhood.</p> <p>Mr Barak gave orders to the Israeli delegation to prepare to leave and took the unusual step of addressing an open letter to Mr Clinton.</p> <p>He wrote: \"The Palestinians arrived at Camp David lacking good faith, and are not ready to have a substantive discussion about a lasting peace and to make historic decisions . . .</p> <p>\"Unless there are last-minute changes, the Palestinians will have to rue the tragic consequences of a missed opportunity.\"</p> <p>Mr Clinton held emergency talks with both leaders, and made hasty telephone calls to President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, King Abdullah of Jordan and other Middle East leaders, looking for regional support for the talks.</p> <p>But it was only around midnight, after the presidential motorcade was packed and Mr Clinton's limousine prepared for his departure, that word came from the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators that they were ready to stay on.</p> <p>Sources close to the negotiators hinted that this was more out of respect for Mr Clinton and his peace efforts than any indication that the divide over Jerusalem had narrowed.</p> <p>A weary Bill Clinton left for Okinawa in the early hours, declaring: \"Both leaders feel the weight of history but both, I believe, recognise this is a moment in history which they can seize.\"</p> <p>The talks continued on Thursday under the guidance of the secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, and the Israeli delegation went another step towards offering what it termed \"joint sovereignty\" over Jerusalem.</p> <p>According to the scheme, leaked to the Israeli press, the Palestinians would run their own municipal affairs in a number of East Jerusalem districts and would perhaps even fly their own flag over their holy sites in the Old City, but sovereignty would remain in Israeli hands.</p> <p>Back in Jerusalem, the Palestinian spokeswoman, Hanan Ashrawi, said the offer represented nothing new, but it fostered optimism in Washington and Mr Clinton cut short his programme in Okinawa on Sunday to fly back to Camp David.</p> <p>But that glimmer of optimism came to nothing. Despite prolonged negotiations stretching until 5am yesterday, Mr Clinton was unable to square the circle in Jerusalem.</p> <p>The issue of sovereignty, particularly over the Islamic holy sites, remained intractable.</p> <p>The US president and the negotiators slept for a few hours, and on waking made the decision to abandon the talks.</p> <p>Mr Clinton was due to attend a friend's funeral in Arkansas, and had offered to fly straight back to Camp David if there were any faint sparks of optimism, but none remained.</p>",

      "bodyText": "For almost a week before the Camp David peace talks were finally allowed to die, they appeared to be kept on artificial life support, shrouded by pessimism and fear of what might follow in the wake of a breakdown. The White House first announced the summit's collapse last Wednesday night, as President Clinton prepared to leave for the Okinawa G8 economic summit. But barely an hour later it emerged that the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, had agreed to Mr Clinton's last-ditch appealto stay on while he was in Japan. That respite sent out a ripple of optimism, suggesting that the two leaders were more afraid of failure than of a compromise peace. But the agreement to keep talking could not obscure the gaping divide between the two sides, particularly over the fate of Jerusalem. The two Middle East leaders arrived at the presidential retreat on July 11 without a clear idea how the ancient sovereignty dispute over the holy city could be resolved. The mood was friendly and positive, but the problems were obvious. This was encapsulated by a moment just after the first joint appearance by the leaders. Neither could agree on who should enter the presidential cabin first, both insisting that the other should have precedence. The impasse ended with Mr Barak shoving the protesting Mr Arafat over the threshold. The Palestinians came to the talks only reluctantly, concerned that Mr Arafat might come under combined Israeli-US pressure to make concessions on Jerusalem which would be unacceptable to his own people and the wider Arab world. Progress was made quickly on the other key issues. The Israeli delegation put forward a compromise solution to the question of the 3.6m Palestinian refugees, under which about 100,000 would be allowed to return to the homes they fled in the 1948 and 1967 wars, as part of a family reunification programme. The rest would be compensated from an international fund. The Palestinians made it clear that they were willing to accept that position as a starting point for negotiations. Meanwhile, the sides quickly came to a rough agreement on the the borders of a future Palestinian state, incorporating the Gaza Strip and about 90% of the West Bank. The most densely populated Jewish settlements, with about 80% of the Jewish population on the West Bank, would be annexed by Israel, perhaps in return for territory within Israel itself. The fate of Jerusalem, however, continued to present an obstacle to progress, and failure to make progress on the issue triggered the first breakdown last Wednesday. Mr Arafat insisted that the Palestinians must retain sovereignty over the Islamic holy sites - the Dome of the Rock, the Al-Aqsa mosque and their neighbourhood. Mr Barak gave orders to the Israeli delegation to prepare to leave and took the unusual step of addressing an open letter to Mr Clinton. He wrote: \"The Palestinians arrived at Camp David lacking good faith, and are not ready to have a substantive discussion about a lasting peace and to make historic decisions . . . \"Unless there are last-minute changes, the Palestinians will have to rue the tragic consequences of a missed opportunity.\" Mr Clinton held emergency talks with both leaders, and made hasty telephone calls to President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, King Abdullah of Jordan and other Middle East leaders, looking for regional support for the talks. But it was only around midnight, after the presidential motorcade was packed and Mr Clinton's limousine prepared for his departure, that word came from the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators that they were ready to stay on. Sources close to the negotiators hinted that this was more out of respect for Mr Clinton and his peace efforts than any indication that the divide over Jerusalem had narrowed. A weary Bill Clinton left for Okinawa in the early hours, declaring: \"Both leaders feel the weight of history but both, I believe, recognise this is a moment in history which they can seize.\" The talks continued on Thursday under the guidance of the secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, and the Israeli delegation went another step towards offering what it termed \"joint sovereignty\" over Jerusalem. According to the scheme, leaked to the Israeli press, the Palestinians would run their own municipal affairs in a number of East Jerusalem districts and would perhaps even fly their own flag over their holy sites in the Old City, but sovereignty would remain in Israeli hands. Back in Jerusalem, the Palestinian spokeswoman, Hanan Ashrawi, said the offer represented nothing new, but it fostered optimism in Washington and Mr Clinton cut short his programme in Okinawa on Sunday to fly back to Camp David. But that glimmer of optimism came to nothing. Despite prolonged negotiations stretching until 5am yesterday, Mr Clinton was unable to square the circle in Jerusalem. The issue of sovereignty, particularly over the Islamic holy sites, remained intractable. The US president and the negotiators slept for a few hours, and on waking made the decision to abandon the talks. Mr Clinton was due to attend a friend's funeral in Arkansas, and had offered to fly straight back to Camp David if there were any faint sparks of optimism, but none remained.",

Even before the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were airborne for their return from the failed Camp David peace summit, there were warnings of a convulsion of violence at home. On September 13, just six weeks from now, the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat could declare a Palestinian state. With the hope of Israeli recognition now in tatters, and Israel threatening to retaliate for a unilateral declaration, there is a growing fear that the new state will be born in bloodshed - unless the two negotiating teams can be coaxed back to the table again. Earlier yesterday the Israeli army chief told the security committee of the Knesset that he foresaw violent protests in the West Bank, and that Israeli forces there had been put on alert. The briefing by General Shaul Mofaz and his chief of military intelligence amplified dire scenarios that have been circulating in the Israeli media for several days. Newspapers have carried almost daily reports of intelligence officials claiming to have sniffed out plots by Palestinians to storm Jewish settlements in the West Bank. They also say that there could be violent protests by Palestinians in East Jerusalem, which has been occupied by Israel since 1967. There are plenty of people willing to feed such fears. In Gaza and the West Bank, leaders of Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement have been conducting military training for young Palestinians. The exercises, which consist of young people crawling across the desert firing at imaginary Israeli soldiers, are mainly bluster, but they provide an important outlet for the frustration which has been bubbling up in Gaza and the West Bank in the past few months, and which, given a pretext, could explode, given a pretext. With unemployment running at 20%, and the average Gazan earning one-17th of what an Israeli worker takes home, it has become increasingly difficult for Mr Arafat to keep a lid the tension. Many in the squalid refugee camps of the West Bank and Gaza now talk about a new intifada - directed not so much against the Israeli army as against Mr Arafat's corrupt and incompetent regime. Meanwhile Jewish settlements in the West Bank have begun giving weapons training to their women. \"I am afraid that in the short run both sides are sliding towards a confrontation - or a series of small confrontations that could escalate,\" said Menachem Klein, a fellow at the Israeli Institute for Jerusalem Affairs, which helped draft some of the Israeli side's positions before Camp David.",

      "bodyText": "The government is about to withdraw its support for the Ilisu dam project in Turkey. In an remarkable about turn, ministers have agreed to publish new guidelines for export credits guarantees, taking account of the government's policies of sustainable development, human rights and good governance. Cabinet level sources said the guidelines, once they are in force in a new mission statement, would debar export credits from being granted to the dam. The $2bn hydro-electricity project, including construction work by Balfour Beatty, was expected to be funded with the help of $200m of British export credit guarantees. It has caused huge controversy amid concerns that the dam will require the enforced resettlement of thousands of villagers, despoil a beautiful environment and wreck sites of great architectural interest. The all party international development select committee has twice condemned the provision of any credits, saying the dam \"was from the outset conceived and planned in contravention of international standards\". Turkey wants the dam, flooding large parts of the Tigris Valley, to increase its power supply and feed its fast growing economy. Last December the trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, said he was minded to grant export credits, conditional on the Turkish authorities addressing concerns. These included concerns over a resettlement programme, provision of upstream water treatment plants, permanent retention of downstream flows to Syria and Iraq and a detailed plan to preserve sites such as the archaeological site of Hasankeyf. Ministerial sources said yesterday the Turkish authorities had not responded well to these demands, partly due to its objections in principle to interference from foreign governments. There has been little evidence, for instance, that Turkey is willing to consult the downstream countries on use of the waters of the Tigris. Syria and Iraq have protested to the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, over Turkey's reluctance to talk to them. Mr Byers refused to comment in detail yesterday, saying only: \"It is only if the Turkish authorities meet each condition in full that export credits will be granted.\" However, it is understood that there is now consensus in Whitehall that the export credits guarantee department must move away from backing big projects, such as the dam, and towards smaller projects. It is also understood that Mr Byers has intervened to require the ECGD to guarantee contracts for the building of low cost housing in Romania. The year-long ECGD review published yesterday states: \"The UK has important international policies to promote sustainable development, human rights and good governance throughout the world and to secure improvements in global security and economic prospects. It is appropriate for the ECGD to promote these objectives, given that it is relying on the taxpayer to stand behind the guarantees it issues.\" Publishing a review of the department, which insures exporters against the risk of foreign buyers defaulting, Mr Byers said: \"The review will ensure that ECGD is able to meet the challenges of the years ahead. As a result of this review I now expect ECGD to be able to do more to help the poorest countries to emerge from debt and poverty burdens and to return to the international trading community.\" But campaigners said the review was a damage limitation exercise which added a gloss of human rights and sustainable development rhetoric to the mission of a flawed institution. Barry Coates, director of the World Development Movement, said: \"It is a complete cave-in to corporate interests. The government seems to have a corporate welfare, rather than an ethical, dimension at the centre of its foreign policy.\" He said the ECGD would still provide cover for defence exports, which represent more than 50% of the department's business. Bowen Wells, chairman of the international development commitee, said the mission statement still did not put human rights issues at the heart of the ECGD's principles. The decision on the Ilusu dam project would be the test case of its efficacy.",

Vinnie lands lead Hollywood role Former soccer hard man Vinnie Jones, 35, who made his name as an actor in the British film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, has landed his first major Hollywood starring role, in the \u00a360m thriller Swordfish. Signatures on net made legal Electronic signatures used to sign documents on the internet yesterday became legally admissible in court as handwritten signatures, the Department of Trade announced. BBC wins fight over 'cult boy' The BBC yesterday won the right to broadcast an interview with a teenager believed to have fled with members of a cult. Mr Justice Munby at the high court set aside an injunction which banned any interviews with Bobby Kelly, 16, from Romford, Essex, or members of the Jesus Christians group. Two battle to stay in TV show The first victim of the Channel 4 game show Big Brother will be one of the five women participants.

      "bodyText": "A \u00a3140m fund to encourage and cultivate scientific entrepreneurs is to be unveiled today by the government in an attempt to turn British universities into US-style seedbeds of commercial innovation. The proposal will form the centrepiece of a science white paper, Excellence and Opportunity. The science minister, Lord Sainsbury, will portray the higher education innovation fund as a third stream of core funding for universities to be set alongside funding for teaching and pure research. The white paper will also call for science ambassadors in schools to convince children that scientists can make money and earn respect. It will call for improved communication strategy for scientists about their experiments and inventions. In addition, money will be made available to match the salaries of scientists who have quit Britain for the US in the so-called science brain drain. The proposals were welcomed by Chris Evans, chairman of Merlin Ventures and one of Britain's most successful science entrepreneurs. He said yesterday: \"The innovation fund is a large amount of money and means scientists will be able to get cash from within universities to develop their ideas commercially, rather than having to go with begging bowls to venture capitalists. \"We still have a quality science base, but we have been going backwards over the past 10 years. This sets out a vision to create more scientific entrepreneurs. \"There are not enough of us around. I am over 40 now, but made my first \u00a31m by 28. Where are the 28-year-olds of today?\" Ministers believe the new emphasis on knowledge transfer from laboratory to the boardroom will not undermine scientific rigour. Evidence from the US suggests the most rigorous research bases tend to be the most innovative commercially. In 1998, a total of 223 businesses spun out of UK higher education institutions, but ministers believe this represents only a small fraction of the potential to develop enterprise universities. Ministers expect the knowledge driven economy to require an ever higher research base. Universities in the future could develop a strategic economic role within their region. The \u00a3140m fund over three years, secured in the spending review, will be used to develop a closer understanding of the skills and knowledge that university research bases can bring to companies. The money will also be deployed to bring businesses into educational institutions to help train academics and researchers to develop commercial skills such as filing patents, securing venture capital and writing business plans. Finally, the money will be used to set up incubator units near universities in which small companies specialising for instance in health care, chemical and pharmaceutical industries can be established, drawing on the expertise in the university. Lord Sainsbury and the industry secretary, Stephen Byers, are expected today to praise academic entrepreneurs, including Dr Evans, and successful companies spun out of Cambridge. The reforms are designed to motivate British scientists, engineers and businesspeople to take advantage of the current scientific revolution to create wealth.",

Barry Hinkley, 51, was arrested by vice squad officers in Houston, Texas, after he allegedly telephoned an escort agency in an attempt to procure a black male prostitute for sex. Mr Hinkley, who is married with three children, was an executive director of Mr Souter's Stagecoach bus company. He was in the US on business when he was arrested on June 28.

Stagecoach said yesterday morning that Mr Hinkley had been suspended indefinitely, but by early evening he had resigned. Mr Hinkley, from Bassenthwaite, Cumbria, was on business at Coach USA - the huge American bus company taken over by Stagecoach last year - when he was arrested by a Texan police officer in his Houston hotel room. It is alleged that at 9.50pm Mr Hinkley telephoned a fictitious escort agency set up by undercover police officers and asked for a black male to visit his room. A police officer manning the telephone line arranged for a black officer to go to Mr Hinkley's room at the exclusive Omni hotel.

A spokesman for Harris County police yesterday confirmed Mr Hinkley had been charged with attempting to solicit a prostitute. He denied the charge.

Mr Souter, backed by the main Scottish tabloid dailies, was the driving force behind the movement to keep section 28 in Scotland. His campaign culminated in a much criticised referendum - the first privately funded referendum in the UK - in which only around a quarter of Scots took part.

A study carried out in Finland, where coffee drinking is heavy and permeates all social strata, has shown that there is a link between the number of cups drunk each day and the chances of developing rheumatoid factor - a hallmark antibody of rheumatoid arthritis which shows up in tests before any symptoms develop and is a predictor of rheumatoid arthritis. In the journal Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, the Finnish researchers report on two large studies carried out on populations of Finns over the age of 30. One was a cross sectional survey of almost 7,000 people, and the other involved almost 19,000 people, who were monitored for around 15 years. None of the study participants had any evidence of arthritis when first tested. Markku Helivaara, of the National Public Health Institute in Helsinki, and colleagues found a strong association between the number of daily cups of coffee and the presence of rheumatoid factor in the smaller study. In the larger one, those people who drank four or more cups of coffee a day were twice as likely to test positive for arthritis as those who drank less. Those who drank 11 or more cups a day were almost 15 times as likely to have rheumatoid factor as non-coffee drinkers. The researchers said there was known to be a link between smoking and obesity and rheumatoid arthritis, but even after they weighted their findings to remove those factors - and also age, gender, blood cholesterol and education levels - the association between coffee drinking and the disease remained. As yet, they do not know what it is in coffee that could trigger rheumatoid factor, leading to arthritis. \"It cannot be concluded whether the associations between coffee consumption and rheumatoid factor and rheumatoid arthritis were due to coffee exposure itself or to some lifestyle or dietary factor closely linked with it,\" they said. The researchers also noted that many Finns had been switching from the strong unfiltered coffee they traditionally drank, and that the age of developing arthritis had risen over the same period (from 1975 to 1990) from an average of 50.2 to 57.8 years. The researchers suggested that further studies should look at the type of coffee consumed. \"Possibly some ingredient in coffee, unidentified so far and removable by filtration, might trigger the production of rheumatoid factor,\" they said. But they were sufficiently confident of their findings to suggest coffee drinking must now be considered as a risk factor in rheumatoid arthritis. \"If coffee consumption were to show a modest association with either rheumatoid factor or rheumatoid arthritis, the most likely explanation for such a finding would be confounding or chance alone,\" they wrote. \"That our main results, from two independent studies with different designs and outcomes, point to the same inference clearly suggests that the phenomenon is real, even if its mechanism remains unknown.\"",

No clear motive has yet emerged to explain the apparent suicide of former civil servant Robert Mochrie and the killing of his wife, Catherine, and the couple's four children, who were beaten to death with a blunt instrument. Police are investigating whether financial worries could have led to the deaths. Detective Superintendent Kevin O'Neill, of South Wales police, said the focus of the investigation was on the family's financial background, their relationships and the couple's marriage, but so far nothing stood out. \"It is difficult because of the period of time between their deaths and when they were discovered. It is more likely probable we will never know what really happened.\" The bodies of Catherine Mochrie, 45, and her four children, Bethan, 10, Luke, 14, Sian, 16, and James, 18, were found in bed in their separate bedrooms on Sunday after friends reported they had not seen the family for several days. Mr Mochrie was discovered hanging on the landing of the house where the family had lived for 15 years. Police said last night that they had not yet found the blunt instrument used in the assault. Postmortem examinations of the bodies are continuing. Mr O'Neill said there was no indication that the victims had been restrained before being killed. Nor was there any evidence they had been drugged, although that was one line of inquiry. It was initially thought the bodies could have been in the house for up to 11 days. But Mr O'Neill said Luke Mochrie had spent most of last Tuesday evening in a pub with a friend. Mrs Mochrie's younger brother, former Wales and British Lions international rugby player Terry Holmes, issued a statement through police yesterday in which he said: \"Our family have been completely devastated by the loss of my sister and her family. I simply do not know how to begin putting into words how we are feeling. \"We are supporting each other as best we can through this terrible time and as you can understand we obviously need time to grieve.\"",

      "bodyText": "Pressure on the Russian tycoon Boris Berezovsky has increased with the decision of the Swiss supreme court to let a Russian prosecutor have documents today showing evidence of alleged fraud at Aeroflot during the 1990s. Mr Berezovsky appealed in February against the handover of papers relating to two companies in Switzerland which he part owned. The companies, Andava and Forus, handled the Russian airline's financial affairs. The court rejected Mr Berezovsky's claim that an investigation launched by prosecutors in Russia last year was politically motivated, and granted the judicial assistance first requested in May last year. The Russian accusations, detailed for the first time in the Swiss ruling, show that Mr Berezovsky is suspected of placing associates in key positions at Aeroflot after part of the state airline was sold in 1993, so that they could divert profits and other funds to companies he controlled. The Swiss authorities have frozen bank accounts containing $715m (\u00a3472m). Russian prosecutors claim that foreign offices of Aeroflot were ordered in May 1996 to pay 80% of their profits to a Swiss bank account, netting $400m. Another $200m is alleged to have come from air traffic rights paid by foreign airlines using Russian airspace. A total of $115m was deposited with unidentified companies. \"Berezovsky and his associates allegedly used these laundered funds for financial operations in Russia, to personal ends,\" the court said in the ruling released this week. It added that the Russian investigating magistrate, Nikolai Volkov, had presented sufficient evidence of a serious judicial investigation. \"In any case, there is nothing to indicate that the suspicions levelled against [Mr Berezovsky] might have been fabricated or were part of a political conspiracy.\" Mr Berezovsky was interviewed by Mr Volkov about the Aeroflot case 10 days ago. Shortly afterwards he resigned from the Russian parliament. He described his departure as a protest at \"authoritarian\" trends in Russia. But political analysts in Moscow saw it as a sign that the influential position Mr Berezovsky enjoyed in the Kremlin under Boris Yeltsin was at risk under Russia's new president, Vladimir Putin. His resignation came just days after five of the country's most prominent tycoons found themselves under scrutiny from government prosecutors and tax police. Mr Berezovsky made light of the investigations yesterday, dismissing Russian media reports that he planned to leave Russia and request political asylum in France. The supreme court ruling also reveals that Mr Volkov told the Swiss in November that although he was dropping charges of money laundering against Mr Berezovsky at that time, the proceedings were not closed and he was prepared to revive charges with new evidence from Switzerland. Charges are pending against two business associates and former Aeroflot managers, Nikolai Gluchkov and Alexander Krasnenker. Mr Volkov will collect about 200 pages of banking and company documents today. He will also have the opportunity to examine several hundred pages more during his visit. Forus and Andava, based in Lausanne, have rejected the Russian charges as false and unjustified. They said Mr Berezovsky left the boards of the companies in 1996 and 1997 respectively. Forus hired the international auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers to examine its transactions with Aeroflot.

He later interviewed officers who had spoken to the investigators. \"War-weary Serb officers have spoken for the first time of sickening atrocities committed by the Yugoslav army in Kosovo during the Nato bombing campaign\" in mid-1999, he wrote.</p> <p>\"One field commander admitted that he watched in horror as a soldier decapitated a three-year-old boy in front of his family. Another soldier described how tanks in his unit indiscriminately shelled Albanian villages before paramilitary police moved in and massacred the survivors.</p> <p>\"The shocking confessions were made by officers who took part in a survey commissioned by the army intelligence unit in January and February this year.\"</p> <p>The military men who spoke to Mr Filipovic claimed to be shocked by the enormity of the crimes committed in Kosovo at the climax of the conflict provoked by the secession attempts of the province's ethnic Albanian majority. Particularly disturbing were the combined testimonies of field officers which suggested that Yugoslav army units were responsible for the death of at least 800 Albanian children under the age of five.</p> <p>Several officers interviewed by Mr Filipovic said that the army's internal survey had been aimed at gauging their morale at a time when new tension was developing - this time between Serbia and Montenegro. The veterans said they were appalled by the prospect of mounting a military campaign against their ethnic Montenegrin cousins.</p> <p>Those interviewed said they were traumatised by what they had seen in Kosovo .</p> <p>One officer, Drazen, said, \"I watched with my own eyes as a reservist lined up around 30 Albanian women and children against a wall. I thought he just wanted to frighten them, but then he crouched down behind an anti-aircraft machine gun and pulled the trigger.\"</p>",

His hard-hitting pieces have included reports on the defection of generals from the Yugoslav army and the sending of elite army and police units in plain clothes to Kosovo in recent months to incite clashes between Serb and Albanian civilians, with the aim of discrediting international peacekeeping efforts. The presiding judge, a colonel, ordered the court into closed session soon after the trial opened yesterday, because the deputy military prosecutor, Captain Aleksandar Kalicanin, said Mr Filipovic's testimony would contain sensitive military information. The charges state that he committed espionage by \"collecting secret military data from the beginning of May 1999 until May 2000, with the intention of passing it on to foreign organisations such as IWPR and AFP.\" They also say he spread false information - with the intention of provoking civil unrest - by reporting that \"the Yugoslav army committed atrocities in Kosovo and Metohija [a mountainous district in the province], and shelled and destroyed villages\". Mr Filipovic's most dramatic story was about an internal army survey into wartime atrocities. He later interviewed officers who had spoken to the investigators. \"War-weary Serb officers have spoken for the first time of sickening atrocities committed by the Yugoslav army in Kosovo during the Nato bombing campaign\" in mid-1999, he wrote. \"One field commander admitted that he watched in horror as a soldier decapitated a three-year-old boy in front of his family. Another soldier described how tanks in his unit indiscriminately shelled Albanian villages before paramilitary police moved in and massacred the survivors. \"The shocking confessions were made by officers who took part in a survey commissioned by the army intelligence unit in January and February this year.\" The military men who spoke to Mr Filipovic claimed to be shocked by the enormity of the crimes committed in Kosovo at the climax of the conflict provoked by the secession attempts of the province's ethnic Albanian majority. Particularly disturbing were the combined testimonies of field officers which suggested that Yugoslav army units were responsible for the death of at least 800 Albanian children under the age of five. Several officers interviewed by Mr Filipovic said that the army's internal survey had been aimed at gauging their morale at a time when new tension was developing - this time between Serbia and Montenegro. The veterans said they were appalled by the prospect of mounting a military campaign against their ethnic Montenegrin cousins. Those interviewed said they were traumatised by what they had seen in Kosovo . One officer, Drazen, said, \"I watched with my own eyes as a reservist lined up around 30 Albanian women and children against a wall. I thought he just wanted to frighten them, but then he crouched down behind an anti-aircraft machine gun and pulled the trigger.\"",

SmithKline's chief executive, Jean-Pierre Garnier, said: \"Perhaps we were a little optimistic with our original timetable.\" </p> <p>Excluding currency effects, interim profits rose 13% to \u00a31.05bn. </p> <p>SmithKline's top selling product, the antidepressant Paxil, increased its six-month sales by 15% to \u00a3705m, while antibiotic Augmentin and the group's vaccines portfolio grew significantly. </p> <p>However, the star performer was Avandia, which generated revenue of \u00a3114m in the second quarter, compared to analysts' expectations of \u00a390m. Mr Garnier said: \"Avandia has been talked about as a potential blockbuster but nobody was really quite sure. After this quarter, it's obvious that it is really going places.\" </p> <p>Avandia makes insulin work more effectively in regulating the body's sugar levels. Traditional diabetes treatments put extra strain on the already weak pancreas to make it produce more insulin. </p> <p>Doctors have written more than 3m Avandia prescriptions in America and the product has just reached the market in Britain and Germany.

      "bodyText": "SmithKline Beecham yesterday proved it was in robust health ahead of its merger with Glaxo Wellcome by notching up a 14% rise in half-year profits, helped by an outstanding performance from its new diabetes drug, Avandia. The pharmaceutical group's figures beat City expectations but were tarnished by news of a month-long delay in completion of the merger, as America's federal trade commission scrutinises the transaction. The new date for the tie-up to be completed is September 25. SmithKline's chief executive, Jean-Pierre Garnier, said: \"Perhaps we were a little optimistic with our original timetable.\" Excluding currency effects, interim profits rose 13% to \u00a31.05bn. SmithKline's top selling product, the antidepressant Paxil, increased its six-month sales by 15% to \u00a3705m, while antibiotic Augmentin and the group's vaccines portfolio grew significantly. However, the star performer was Avandia, which generated revenue of \u00a3114m in the second quarter, compared to analysts' expectations of \u00a390m. Mr Garnier said: \"Avandia has been talked about as a potential blockbuster but nobody was really quite sure. After this quarter, it's obvious that it is really going places.\" Avandia makes insulin work more effectively in regulating the body's sugar levels. Traditional diabetes treatments put extra strain on the already weak pancreas to make it produce more insulin. Doctors have written more than 3m Avandia prescriptions in America and the product has just reached the market in Britain and Germany. Mr Garnier described it as \"a very elegant way of helping mother nature do the right thing\". Mr Garnier, who will be chief executive of the combined Glaxo SmithKline, has come under fire for his potential pay package - he could be awarded share options worth up to 20 times his salary. The French-born chief executive replied: \"If you want Britain to be a place where world champions reside, you have to be pragmatic and see that we are playing on a ball park much bigger than just the UK.\"",

      "bodyText": "George W Bush opted for safety yesterday when he named Dick Cheney, defence secretary in his father's 1989-93 administration, as his Republican vice-presidential running mate in this year's battle for the White House. Mr Bush telephoned Mr Cheney, 59, early yesterday to offer him the post. Mr Cheney accepted immediately, and the two made their first joint campaign appearance in Austin later in the day. The Texas governor contacted several other senior Republicans whose names had been under consideration to tell them of his decision. Mr Cheney's emergence as Mr Bush's No 2 on the Republican ticket was widely welcomed by party grandees, who praised his wealth of political experience and his appeal to both wings of the party, but there was an unmistakable tinge of anti-climax to the announcement of what Mr Bush had originally promised would be a \"surprising\" and \"electrifying\" choice. Mr Bush originally asked Mr Cheney to head the process of selecting his running mate. In the end, though, and to the private irritation of some of those he had intensively vetted, Mr Bush preferred to go for the man himself - a known quantity, an old family friend, a fellow Texas oil magnate and a well-known conservative. As a former White House chief of staff and defence secretary, Mr Cheney may seem like a man from the past, but he has always been identified as someone with a big future. He is best known internationally for the four years he spent as defence secretary in President George Bush's administration. The central event of those years was the Gulf war, in which Mr Cheney presided over the biggest US military operation since the Vietnam war. For a man with an uncompromising reputation as a military hawk, Mr Cheney's own Vietnam era record is less belligerent. As a student he secured five successive draft deferments. He and his wife Lynne, his high-school sweetheart, have two adult daughters. But Mr Cheney has long been seen as a political high-flyer. At 26, he was hired by the Nixon White House to work on anti-inflation policy. At 33, as a protege of another former defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, he became Gerald Ford's chief of staff. After Mr Ford lost the White House, Mr Cheney went home to Wyoming - he is a graduate of the University of Wyoming - to run for Congress. Though he suffered a mild heart attack during the campaign when he was only 37, he won easily, and served six terms. The 1978 heart attack was the first of three he has suffered. The others followed in 1984 and 1988. All three attacks have been described as mild. Mr Cheney had quadruple heart bypass surgery in 1988 before taking on the job of defence secretary. His doctors said this week that he was \"up to a strenuous campaign\". Mr Cheney's abilities were quickly recognised. By the mid-1980s, the Almanac of American Politics tipped him as \"clearly a major national politician\" and a future party leader. He was \"the natural candidate of moderates who viscerally prefer a Ford to a Reagan - and the record on issues to be the first choice of a great many Reaganites\". His strictly conservative voting record in Congress was being pored over by friend and foe alike yesterday, and is certain to become an issue in the campaign. It includes absolute opposition to gun control. But perhaps the crucial votes as far as the November election is concerned are the ones that Mr Cheney cast against abortion, against the Equal Rights Act for women in 1983, and against the Head Start education programme for minorities. Mr Cheney's profitable links with the Texas oil industry, which is also the source of the Bush family's wealth, will be another big issue in November, not least with environmentalists. Since 1995 he has been chief executive officer and chairman of the Halliburton Corporation, the Dallas-based multinational which is the world's largest supplier of construction, engineering and maintenance equipment and services to the oil industry. He is understood to have earned about $2m (\u00a31.3m) last year in salary, benefits and options at Halliburton. Last month, profiting spectacularly from the electorally sensitive worldwide increase in oil prices, he sold about 100,000 of his Halliburton shares - approximately half his personal holding in the company, raising an estimated $5.1 million. Another intensely sensitive aspect of the Halliburton connection, which could lead to conflict of interest allegations, is the company's stake in two American oil industry companies, Dresser-Rand and Ingersoll-Dresser Pump, which are involved in trying to reconstruct the Iraqi oil industry after the Gulf war. Halliburton also has major interests in the Russian oil industry. Where he stands: Dick Cheney's voting record in Congress 1978-89 For \u0095 Increasing Pentagon spending \u0095 Aid to Nicaraguan contras \u0095 Postponing new air pollution regulations \u0095 American Indian rights Against \u0095 Equal Rights Act for women \u0095 Head Start education programme \u0095 Gun control \u0095 Federal funding of abortion provision",

      "body": "<p>Senior Conservatives yesterday warned that the government will have to abandon more of its legislative programme in the wake of this week's defeat of attempts to repeal the section 28 ban on the \"promotion\" of homosexuality by local authorities.</p> <p>Downing Street confirmed that Tony Blair's cabinet will not engage in brinkmanship tactics with the Lords and is likely to abandon the repeal rather than risk losing the local government bill of which it was part. Some Labour peers now agree that one bill may have to be sacrificed if the next Queen's speech - the last before the election - is not to be delayed until late November.</p> <p>After a crossbench coalition of peers voted 270 to 228 on Monday night to keep section 28 Mr Blair's spokesman called the action \"a piece of prejudice\" and said that nearly half of young gays experience homophobic bullying. Gay groups were also dismayed.</p> <p>The executive director of Stonewall, Angela Mason, said: \"Dropping the repeal of section 28 doesn't resolve the problem. The real issue here is how lesbians and gay men are treated in our society and the refusal of the Lords to pass any gay law reforms. It is disgraceful that an unelected body can ride roughshod over our civil rights.\"</p> <p>Lord Strathclyde, William Hague's Lords leader, seized on Mr Blair's retreat to complain that peers face a \"mountain of work\" on seven bills when they return to Westminster in September - a month earlier than elected MPs. \"We make no complaint about that. That is our duty. But equally, we will not be prepared to cut short scrutiny of bills because the government has tried to legislate too much. We will not be deterred from our duty by crude threats to remove more members of the house in a new Lords bill,\" he said.</p> <p>The bills at stake include large and complex ones and one high-profile casualty could be the long-delayed freedom of information act. Others are the countryside bill; the Northern Ireland bill which changes the status of the RUC; the mode of trial bill, which restricts the right to trial by jury; the crime bill; the political parties bill; the transport bill; and the fur farming bill.</p> <p>The FoI bill, widely criticised for being too weak, was tabled last year, but not debated in the Lords until April. No date has been fixed for the committee stage in the Lords where 190 amendments have been tabled. Those will be debated during the October \"spillover\" period before the Queen's speech opening parliament in November.</p> <p>The growing legislative confusion was highlighted when peers refused to complete their work on the football (disorder) bill last night. A backbench demand for an extra day was passed despite frontbench Tory support for the government's timetable.</p> <p><b>Dissident peers</b></p> <p><b> Labour peers who voted to keep section 28: </b> Lord Ahmed; Lord Cocks of Hartcliffe; Lord Dixon; Lord Donoughue; Lord Evans of Parkside; Lord Islwyn; Lord Lofthouse of Pontefract; Earl Longford; Lord Mason of Barnsley; Lord Mishcon; Lord Orme; Lord Patel of Blackburn; Lord Shore of Stepney; Lord Simon; Lord Stallard; Lord Stoddart of Swindon. <br><b> Tory peers who voted against Lady Young's amendment:</b> Lord Garel-Jones; Lord Gilmour of Craigmillar; Lord St John of Fawsley; Lord Andrew Lloyd-Webber; Lord Norton of Louth.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Senior Conservatives yesterday warned that the government will have to abandon more of its legislative programme in the wake of this week's defeat of attempts to repeal the section 28 ban on the \"promotion\" of homosexuality by local authorities. Downing Street confirmed that Tony Blair's cabinet will not engage in brinkmanship tactics with the Lords and is likely to abandon the repeal rather than risk losing the local government bill of which it was part. Some Labour peers now agree that one bill may have to be sacrificed if the next Queen's speech - the last before the election - is not to be delayed until late November. After a crossbench coalition of peers voted 270 to 228 on Monday night to keep section 28 Mr Blair's spokesman called the action \"a piece of prejudice\" and said that nearly half of young gays experience homophobic bullying. Gay groups were also dismayed. The executive director of Stonewall, Angela Mason, said: \"Dropping the repeal of section 28 doesn't resolve the problem. The real issue here is how lesbians and gay men are treated in our society and the refusal of the Lords to pass any gay law reforms. It is disgraceful that an unelected body can ride roughshod over our civil rights.\" Lord Strathclyde, William Hague's Lords leader, seized on Mr Blair's retreat to complain that peers face a \"mountain of work\" on seven bills when they return to Westminster in September - a month earlier than elected MPs. \"We make no complaint about that. That is our duty. But equally, we will not be prepared to cut short scrutiny of bills because the government has tried to legislate too much. We will not be deterred from our duty by crude threats to remove more members of the house in a new Lords bill,\" he said. The bills at stake include large and complex ones and one high-profile casualty could be the long-delayed freedom of information act. Others are the countryside bill; the Northern Ireland bill which changes the status of the RUC; the mode of trial bill, which restricts the right to trial by jury; the crime bill; the political parties bill; the transport bill; and the fur farming bill. The FoI bill, widely criticised for being too weak, was tabled last year, but not debated in the Lords until April. No date has been fixed for the committee stage in the Lords where 190 amendments have been tabled. Those will be debated during the October \"spillover\" period before the Queen's speech opening parliament in November. The growing legislative confusion was highlighted when peers refused to complete their work on the football (disorder) bill last night. A backbench demand for an extra day was passed despite frontbench Tory support for the government's timetable. Dissident peers Labour peers who voted to keep section 28: Lord Ahmed; Lord Cocks of Hartcliffe; Lord Dixon; Lord Donoughue; Lord Evans of Parkside; Lord Islwyn; Lord Lofthouse of Pontefract; Earl Longford; Lord Mason of Barnsley; Lord Mishcon; Lord Orme; Lord Patel of Blackburn; Lord Shore of Stepney; Lord Simon; Lord Stallard; Lord Stoddart of Swindon. Tory peers who voted against Lady Young's amendment: Lord Garel-Jones; Lord Gilmour of Craigmillar; Lord St John of Fawsley; Lord Andrew Lloyd-Webber; Lord Norton of Louth.",

What's more, if you were serious about pirating DVDs, you wouldn't bother descrambling them first; you'd just take an original along to one of the dodgier pressing plants and ask them to run off a few thousand. As one website puts it (my paraphrasing), \"DeCSS is like a translator for a book written in a foreign language - ie the DVD - and every DVD player has the same translator in it.

      "body": "<p>The disembowelling of previously accepted versions of historical events is the stock-in-trade of <strong> Secret History</strong> (C4), but its film about the Battle of Britain, The Few, was a threadbare effort to dredge up some retroactive controversy. A thimble-full of evidence had been spun into a souffl\u00e9 of supposition and innuendo, as a handful of elderly ex-fighter pilots were invited to air grievances they'd apparently been harbouring for 60 years. </p> <p>Certainly it wasn't hard to believe that there was a divide between the officer class in the RAF, many of them moneyed former public schoolboys who'd enjoyed a privileged lifestyle in the services between the wars, and the working-class newcomers who joined up via the Volunteer Reserve as the war loomed. But the assumption that everyone unquestion ingly accepts the myth that the nation was saved from the Hun by squadrons of pipe-smoking Terry-Thomases was simply wrong, as if it had never previously occurred to anybody that flicks like The First Of The Few or Reach For The Sky were idealised propaganda.

      "bodyText": "The disembowelling of previously accepted versions of historical events is the stock-in-trade of Secret History (C4), but its film about the Battle of Britain, The Few, was a threadbare effort to dredge up some retroactive controversy. A thimble-full of evidence had been spun into a souffl\u00e9 of supposition and innuendo, as a handful of elderly ex-fighter pilots were invited to air grievances they'd apparently been harbouring for 60 years. Certainly it wasn't hard to believe that there was a divide between the officer class in the RAF, many of them moneyed former public schoolboys who'd enjoyed a privileged lifestyle in the services between the wars, and the working-class newcomers who joined up via the Volunteer Reserve as the war loomed. But the assumption that everyone unquestion ingly accepts the myth that the nation was saved from the Hun by squadrons of pipe-smoking Terry-Thomases was simply wrong, as if it had never previously occurred to anybody that flicks like The First Of The Few or Reach For The Sky were idealised propaganda. As long ago as 1969, the Battle Of Britain movie depicted rumblings of class friction behind the scenes. A couple of unverifiable anecdotes from elderly ex-flyers was scarcely sufficient to support The Few's allegations that officers lived in comfort away from their airfields while the proletariat were left in tents to be bombed by the Luftwaffe, or that officers deliberately withheld crucial information about dogfighting tactics from their social inferiors so they could shoot down more Jerries and increase their own prestige.

Eagle's Wing (Anthony Harvey, 1978) 1am, Carlton Cinema An odd but excellent British excursion into western territory, with Martin Sheen's naive trapper and Sam Waterston's Kiowa brave in a protracted duel/chase for possession of a beautiful white horse. Think white, think Moby Dick and abstract entities; it's an idiosyncratic, obtuse vision of the west, though rich in character and filmed with a fine eye for landscape. Harvey Keitel is briefly involved. La Grande Bouffe (Marco Ferreri, 1973) 2.10am, FilmFour This tale of outrageous self indulgence has the mad old Marquis De Sade much in mind, and earned Ferreri a certain notoriety for the extreme nature of the themes and content. Supposedly an allegory on the dangers of rampant consumerism, it follows the last days of four libertines who have vowed to eat and screw themselves to death, and attracted a heavyweight cast: Marcello Mastroianni, Philippe Noiret, Ugo Tognazzi and Michel Piccoli.",

There's no time limit in which you have to write. One day you might read over what you've done and think about it. You pick up the pencil or turn on the computer, but no new words come. That's fine. Sometimes you can't go further. Correct a misspelling, reread a perplexing paragraph, and then let it go. You have re-entered the dream of the work, and that's enough to keep the story alive for another 24 hours. The next day you might write for hours; there's no way to tell.

The world wants you to be someone known, someone with solid ideas, not blowing smoke. Given a day, reality will begin to scatter your notions; given two days, it will drive them off. </p> <p>The act of writing is a kind of guerrilla warfare: there is no vacation. In actuality there is very little chance of victory. You are, you fear, like that homeless man, likely to be defeated by your fondest dreams. But then the next day comes, and the words are waiting.

      "body": "<p>\"That person from Montana, that cowboy who writes at night when he's off the range,\" Billy Campbell murmurs in his deep southern drawl. \"That woman who wrote in college but hasn't picked it up because she is trying to be a mother to four children in Iowa. That person from South Carolina.\" He is describing the kind of contestants he hopes will enter Project Greenlight, a new competition to find the US's best unknown film-maker. </p> <p>No, Campbell insists, this is not a stunt to unearth yet another brat in the Tarantino mould. Cowboys, oldtimers and suburban moms have as much a chance of winning as goatee-bearded film-school wunderkinds. All they need to do is submit their screenplays to a special website (<a href=\"http://www.projectgreenlight.com\">www.projectgreenlight.com</a>) \"If you win, we'll pay you to direct it,\" runs the ad. \"We'll produce an HBO series covering it. And Miramax Films will release it.\" </p> <p>Campbell, president of Miramax TV, is co-ordinating the entire shebang. \"I have no idea how many screenplays we will receive,\" he reflects. \"We estimate anywhere from 75,000 to 200,000.\" The rules are straightforward. The budget for the winning movie won't exceed $1 million. \"So if someone sends Armageddon, that probably won't be chosen. And if your screenplay is called Pearl Harbor, it's pretty unlikely that will get selected either.\" Only Americans are allowed to enter. (Miramax plans to launch an international version of the competition next year.) You have to be a newcomer. Steven Spielberg is ineligible. So are Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, but buoyed up by their own experiences making Good Will Hunting for Miramax, they've agreed to executive-produce the winning movie anyway. </p> <p>Rather than hire a small army of readers to winnow down the entrants, Campbell's idea is to have the entrants judge themselves. \"Each contestant is electronically sent three scripts at random from other contestants,\" he explains. \"They read them, critique them and fill in forms which are electronically mastered back into our system.\" The judges are hoping for constructive criticism, not spite-filled demolition jobs. \"If you've actually trashed three other people, you are immediately thrown out of the competition. We're not only looking for writing ability, but your ability to analyse others.\" </p> <p>Eventually a shortlist of 40 candidates will be drawn up. It's at this point that Harvey Weinstein (the formidable Miramax boss), Matt Damon and Ben Affleck enter the fray, and that the \"fast- moving, verit\u00e9-style\" TV series begins shooting in earnest. </p> <p>Campbell, a Harvard Business school graduate who helped develop such series as ER and Everybody Loves Raymond, promotes the competition with all the fervour of a Mark Twain-era mountebank selling hair tonic. No, it's not simply another of those marketing wheezes which Miramax is famous for. No, Matt and Ben aren't just along for the ride. The project is being organized to fit in with their busy schedules.

      "bodyText": "\"That person from Montana, that cowboy who writes at night when he's off the range,\" Billy Campbell murmurs in his deep southern drawl. \"That woman who wrote in college but hasn't picked it up because she is trying to be a mother to four children in Iowa. That person from South Carolina.\" He is describing the kind of contestants he hopes will enter Project Greenlight, a new competition to find the US's best unknown film-maker. No, Campbell insists, this is not a stunt to unearth yet another brat in the Tarantino mould. Cowboys, oldtimers and suburban moms have as much a chance of winning as goatee-bearded film-school wunderkinds. All they need to do is submit their screenplays to a special website (www.projectgreenlight.com) \"If you win, we'll pay you to direct it,\" runs the ad. \"We'll produce an HBO series covering it. And Miramax Films will release it.\" Campbell, president of Miramax TV, is co-ordinating the entire shebang. \"I have no idea how many screenplays we will receive,\" he reflects. \"We estimate anywhere from 75,000 to 200,000.\" The rules are straightforward. The budget for the winning movie won't exceed $1 million. \"So if someone sends Armageddon, that probably won't be chosen. And if your screenplay is called Pearl Harbor, it's pretty unlikely that will get selected either.\" Only Americans are allowed to enter. (Miramax plans to launch an international version of the competition next year.) You have to be a newcomer. Steven Spielberg is ineligible. So are Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, but buoyed up by their own experiences making Good Will Hunting for Miramax, they've agreed to executive-produce the winning movie anyway. Rather than hire a small army of readers to winnow down the entrants, Campbell's idea is to have the entrants judge themselves. \"Each contestant is electronically sent three scripts at random from other contestants,\" he explains. \"They read them, critique them and fill in forms which are electronically mastered back into our system.\" The judges are hoping for constructive criticism, not spite-filled demolition jobs. \"If you've actually trashed three other people, you are immediately thrown out of the competition. We're not only looking for writing ability, but your ability to analyse others.\" Eventually a shortlist of 40 candidates will be drawn up. It's at this point that Harvey Weinstein (the formidable Miramax boss), Matt Damon and Ben Affleck enter the fray, and that the \"fast- moving, verit\u00e9-style\" TV series begins shooting in earnest. Campbell, a Harvard Business school graduate who helped develop such series as ER and Everybody Loves Raymond, promotes the competition with all the fervour of a Mark Twain-era mountebank selling hair tonic. No, it's not simply another of those marketing wheezes which Miramax is famous for. No, Matt and Ben aren't just along for the ride. The project is being organized to fit in with their busy schedules.

The subject of his first international success, Les Choses De La Vie (The Things Of Life, 1969) is the realisation by a dying architect (Michel Piccoli) that love for his wife, son and friends is more meaningful than the trappings of wealth.</p> <p>Friendship was as important to Sautet's films as it was to him in life.

He was also a music critic for the leftwing magazine, Combat, from 1949 to 1950. Some of his films were constructed like musical compositions - variations on a theme, played by major and minor characters - and music itself (by Maurice Ravel) was the subject and metaphor for the relationships in Un Coeur En Hiver (A Heart In Winter, 1993).</p> <p>In his mid-20s, Sautet studied at the newly-formed Institut des Hautes Etudes Cinematographiques (IDHEC), where he learnt all aspects of film-making. He then made a short film, Nous N'irons Plus En Bois (1951), worked as a writer on television series, and doctored a number of screenplays, the best being Georges Franju's Eyes Without A Face (1959), a poetic horror movie as distant from his own films as could be.</p> <p>One of Sautet's first features, Classe Tous Risques (The Big Risk, 1960), was a gripping and unusual thriller starring Jean-Paul Belmondo, about secret agents during the Japanese invasion of China. Unfortunately, his directing career began at the same time as the French new wave, and his style was already considered pass\u00e9.

      "body": "<p>It is hard to imagine now, when clothes are paraded every season to switch us over to fashion's latest slant or borrowing, what it meant in the 1960s when Thea Porter, in her little Soho shop, brought the old, sensual Middle East to London.</p> <p>Porter, who has died from a lung infection aged 72, was a painter. She was born Dorothea Seale, the daughter of two Presbyterian missionaries in Syria, who later moved to Beirut. She was educated at the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7aise in Damascus, Fernhill Manor and London University's Royal Holloway College. Her brother is the journalist Patrick Seale, and their father, Morris Seale, wrote Koran And Bible (1978), among other books.</p> <p>Thea married Bob Porter, from the British embassy in Beirut, in 1953. They divorced in 1967. She came to London in 1964 with her eight-year-old daughter Venetia, and first tried to make a living by interior decoration. She got a job at Elizabeth Eaton, but had to leave after a client warned Joy King (Eaton's real name) that Thea was recommending satin. This was the Arab taste that London had yet to see.</p> <p>In 1966, she set up her own shop in Greek Street, Soho, selling huge cushions and French, Italian and Turkish fabrics. She imported some kaftans to cut up into cushions, but kaftans were suddenly in as themselves. She began to make them to her own designs from her furnishing fabrics, using old braid and trimmings. Thea Porter Decorations became Thea Porter Couture.</p> <p>Rich, beautiful women soon found her. She designed her prints and embroideries herself, and had a signature fabric of lilies, which were also printed on wallpaper for her Bolton Street flat, off Piccadilly. Thea Porter clothes were always very sexy, like her. Her dresses and blouses in chiffon and other expensive soft fabrics speak directly to the senses. Anyone who has them is still wearing them, to admiration.</p> <p>The beading, sequins and embroidery were often done in India, but the clothes breathed civilised high-living in hot capitals where France was the admired foreign power. They should have been very expensive. She adapted the Levantine feeling into a modern, artistic look; she decorated a bathroom wall with particles of mirror glass, an idea taken up by Andrew Logan, a sculptor friend who became the artist of mirror glass.</p> <p>Princess Margaret, Baby Jane Holzer, Edna O'Brien, Mick and Bianca Jagger, Pete Townsend, Elizabeth Taylor, Pamela Lady Harlech, Veronique Peck (wife of Gregory), Lauren Bacall and Jutta Laing (wife of RD) wore Thea Porter clothes, and were her friends. She made journalist Christopher Ward a white bridegroom suit. She spotted talent before it had led to fame. She opened a shop in New York in 1968, and another in Paris. She liked to meet Andy Warhol when she was over there.</p> <p>Friends loved brave, funny, naughty Thea, but the fashion press did not fully appreciate her importance, except for the Los Angeles Times's Mary Lou Luther, and Molly Parkin. In a great fashion period, those clothes brought freedom to young working people (short skirts, soft underwear) with bold seams, cut and collars. They said evenings and pleasure, almost decadence. Her customers got a painter's taste and ancient civilisations. Also, unfortunately, a lack of interest in marketing.</p> <p>Thea loved and bought art. She knew Patrick Hughes, Hubert \"Nibs\" Dalwood and Michael Andrews, was a regular at Muriel Belcher's Colony Room, a favourite with Francis Bacon - and even Muriel's waspish successor, Ian Board. When her father met her Soho friends, he commented: \"Publicans and sinners, Thea!\"</p> <p>Her dinner parties were magic-carpet, round a mirrored table in a mirrored alcove. The furniture was Turkish, inlaid with mother-of-pearl. The guests' bent heads were repeated forever up on the mirrored ceiling and down on the table, and, by some quirk, one bit of the table showed the street below, where taxis could be seen arriving.</p> <p>Thea served middle eastern dishes from her kitchen on beautiful plates and, at the end, there was Turkish coffee with cardamom seeds. Several of her friends were Arabs or Byzantine scholars, or from British middle eastern families like the underwater archaeologist Honor Frost. Steeped in the Byzantine, she was un-devious and a pathological truth-teller.</p> <p>She would be accompanied by a businessman, diplomat or painter; she was never without a man. When Peter Langan opened Langan's in the next street, it was a romance of two people each with an exceptional eye. One of Thea's collections was shown there.</p> <p>She was small, with red hair until she died. She held her head up, like a pelican flying. She was like a pelican of legend in that she gave of her blood to her friends, always loyal and too generous. She wasn't a good businesswoman, and not all her men friends helped when brought into her business. It went into liquidation in 1981, but she started again a year later.</p> <p>In 1994, she got a form of Alzheimer's. At first, she could still go out, and a stranger remembers her at a party handing out coloured gemstones from her bag saying: \"Keep this as a souvenir of me, it will bring you luck.\" At a home in Queen's Gate Terrace, she had a large room with her pictures and mother-of-pearl furniture. She was, as usual, popular, and a new nurse, seeing her unable to talk, yet so loving, could not keep back tears. Thea adored her two little granddaughters, and would imagine that the elder, Emily, could fly and was on top of her wardrobe.</p> <p>She loved all flowers and would go with a friend or two to Kew for a picnic. Having forgotten the glasses once, she suggested they drink the wine out of the avocado skins, which turned out to be possible and all right.</p> <p>\u0095 Dorothea 'Thea' Noelle Naomi Porter, couturier, born December 24 1927; died July 24 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is hard to imagine now, when clothes are paraded every season to switch us over to fashion's latest slant or borrowing, what it meant in the 1960s when Thea Porter, in her little Soho shop, brought the old, sensual Middle East to London. Porter, who has died from a lung infection aged 72, was a painter. She was born Dorothea Seale, the daughter of two Presbyterian missionaries in Syria, who later moved to Beirut. She was educated at the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7aise in Damascus, Fernhill Manor and London University's Royal Holloway College. Her brother is the journalist Patrick Seale, and their father, Morris Seale, wrote Koran And Bible (1978), among other books. Thea married Bob Porter, from the British embassy in Beirut, in 1953. They divorced in 1967. She came to London in 1964 with her eight-year-old daughter Venetia, and first tried to make a living by interior decoration. She got a job at Elizabeth Eaton, but had to leave after a client warned Joy King (Eaton's real name) that Thea was recommending satin. This was the Arab taste that London had yet to see. In 1966, she set up her own shop in Greek Street, Soho, selling huge cushions and French, Italian and Turkish fabrics. She imported some kaftans to cut up into cushions, but kaftans were suddenly in as themselves. She began to make them to her own designs from her furnishing fabrics, using old braid and trimmings. Thea Porter Decorations became Thea Porter Couture. Rich, beautiful women soon found her. She designed her prints and embroideries herself, and had a signature fabric of lilies, which were also printed on wallpaper for her Bolton Street flat, off Piccadilly. Thea Porter clothes were always very sexy, like her. Her dresses and blouses in chiffon and other expensive soft fabrics speak directly to the senses. Anyone who has them is still wearing them, to admiration. The beading, sequins and embroidery were often done in India, but the clothes breathed civilised high-living in hot capitals where France was the admired foreign power. They should have been very expensive. She adapted the Levantine feeling into a modern, artistic look; she decorated a bathroom wall with particles of mirror glass, an idea taken up by Andrew Logan, a sculptor friend who became the artist of mirror glass. Princess Margaret, Baby Jane Holzer, Edna O'Brien, Mick and Bianca Jagger, Pete Townsend, Elizabeth Taylor, Pamela Lady Harlech, Veronique Peck (wife of Gregory), Lauren Bacall and Jutta Laing (wife of RD) wore Thea Porter clothes, and were her friends. She made journalist Christopher Ward a white bridegroom suit. She spotted talent before it had led to fame. She opened a shop in New York in 1968, and another in Paris. She liked to meet Andy Warhol when she was over there. Friends loved brave, funny, naughty Thea, but the fashion press did not fully appreciate her importance, except for the Los Angeles Times's Mary Lou Luther, and Molly Parkin. In a great fashion period, those clothes brought freedom to young working people (short skirts, soft underwear) with bold seams, cut and collars. They said evenings and pleasure, almost decadence. Her customers got a painter's taste and ancient civilisations. Also, unfortunately, a lack of interest in marketing. Thea loved and bought art. She knew Patrick Hughes, Hubert \"Nibs\" Dalwood and Michael Andrews, was a regular at Muriel Belcher's Colony Room, a favourite with Francis Bacon - and even Muriel's waspish successor, Ian Board. When her father met her Soho friends, he commented: \"Publicans and sinners, Thea!\" Her dinner parties were magic-carpet, round a mirrored table in a mirrored alcove. The furniture was Turkish, inlaid with mother-of-pearl. The guests' bent heads were repeated forever up on the mirrored ceiling and down on the table, and, by some quirk, one bit of the table showed the street below, where taxis could be seen arriving. Thea served middle eastern dishes from her kitchen on beautiful plates and, at the end, there was Turkish coffee with cardamom seeds. Several of her friends were Arabs or Byzantine scholars, or from British middle eastern families like the underwater archaeologist Honor Frost. Steeped in the Byzantine, she was un-devious and a pathological truth-teller. She would be accompanied by a businessman, diplomat or painter; she was never without a man. When Peter Langan opened Langan's in the next street, it was a romance of two people each with an exceptional eye. One of Thea's collections was shown there. She was small, with red hair until she died. She held her head up, like a pelican flying. She was like a pelican of legend in that she gave of her blood to her friends, always loyal and too generous. She wasn't a good businesswoman, and not all her men friends helped when brought into her business. It went into liquidation in 1981, but she started again a year later. In 1994, she got a form of Alzheimer's. At first, she could still go out, and a stranger remembers her at a party handing out coloured gemstones from her bag saying: \"Keep this as a souvenir of me, it will bring you luck.\" At a home in Queen's Gate Terrace, she had a large room with her pictures and mother-of-pearl furniture. She was, as usual, popular, and a new nurse, seeing her unable to talk, yet so loving, could not keep back tears. Thea adored her two little granddaughters, and would imagine that the elder, Emily, could fly and was on top of her wardrobe. She loved all flowers and would go with a friend or two to Kew for a picnic. Having forgotten the glasses once, she suggested they drink the wine out of the avocado skins, which turned out to be possible and all right. \u0095 Dorothea 'Thea' Noelle Naomi Porter, couturier, born December 24 1927; died July 24 2000",

      "bodyText": "The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, is poised to reopen the controversy over the role of spin in Labour's governing style by appointing a former political editor of the Daily Mirror as his chief spokesman. John Williams, who succeeded Alastair Campbell when he left the Mirror to join Tony Blair's team in 1994, is deputy head of the Foreign Office's news department, where he was recruited after Mr Cook's bumpy first year in office. With the return of his boss Kim Darroch to a diplomatic posting - as the FO's EU director - Mr Williams is set to become the first non-diplomat in the top job, it was unofficially confirmed last night. FO insiders including, it is said, the permanent secretary, Sir John Kerr, advised against the appointment, arguing that while Mr Williams is adept at dealing with political correspondents, he lacks the experience to cover the range of issues that go with the job. The appointment follows controversy over leaked memos, the apparent preoccupation of some ministers with spin, and the creeping politicisation of civil servants who help present the government's message to the media. Led by Mr Campbell, a number of journalists, including three from the Labour-supporting Mirror, have joined the government's information service or the strategic communications unit, which plans long-term media strategy in No 10. Unlike Mr Campbell and other explicitly political special advisers, Mr Williams was initially recruited via normal open appointment procedures, and this time other in-house candidates were interviewed by the FO's selection board. The Treasury and Foreign Office were long alone in Whitehall in appointing high-flying officials to run their press offices, to broaden their experience before they returned to their former job. One of John Major's press secretaries, Gus O'Donnell, went with the then chancellor to No 10, but now runs macroeconomic policy as the Treasury's No 3 official. His successor, Chris Meyer, is now Washington ambassador. It is assumed by officials that when Mr Cook leaves the FO Mr Williams will leave too.

Returning to the US, he worked at the Medical College of Virginia, in Richmond, from 1950 to 1952, and earned an OBE in 1953 for research with Sir William Penney on the medical effects of the early British atomic bomb tests in the Monte Bello Islands. It was from John's work there, on the healing of burns, that unexpected observations of the effect of British anti-lewisite, an antidote to a poison gas, on glucose levels in the blood ignited his life-long interest in diabetes.</p> <p>Returning to Guy's hospital and appointed professor of experimental medicine (or \"experimental professor of medicine\", as he liked to put it) in 1958, John became intrigued by new automated methods for continuous measurement of blood glucose.

In 1981, the prices I paid for socks, trousers, underwear, kitchenware and appliances were higher than those charged at Wal-Mart 19 years later. They were higher still if one adjusts for inflation.</p> <p>But with the relative scarcity of land in Britain, can Wal-Mart be as successful as it has been here in the US?

      "bodyText": "You are right to say that Wal-Mart has been disastrous for the small American shopkeeper (Leader, July 25). But the retailing giant is a hero among Americans of modest means. In 1981, the prices I paid for socks, trousers, underwear, kitchenware and appliances were higher than those charged at Wal-Mart 19 years later. They were higher still if one adjusts for inflation. But with the relative scarcity of land in Britain, can Wal-Mart be as successful as it has been here in the US? North America still has enormous tracts of open space, which the retailer has been able to buy for almost nothing. We will never see a Wal-Mart in Manhattan, since it cannot pay the rent or property tax and still charge its low prices. If Wal-Mart is not allowed to locate on green spaces in Britain, it should instead buy up idle industrial sites.

Most men know that even the most admirable women have problems getting the creases of shirts and trousers right. So many of us keep an ironing board for instructional purposes.

      "body": "<p>In the dank basement of a decrepit academic institute in the village of Bolshevik, a grey provincial sprawl 100 miles from Moscow, Genady Zharikov is cultivating worms. Blue plastic washing-up bowls have been converted into breeding farms for 10 different varieties.</p> <p>Dr Zharikov has skinny, pale worms that feed on manure and a darker, fatter breed which eats paper shreds torn from Soviet scientific journals. But it is the small, deep-red coloured hybrid that he is most proud of.</p> <p>The technique he has developed for cleaning industrially poisoned soil using these worms has been hailed as an international breakthrough in environmental science.</p> <p>His successes, and those of the institute where he works, are an inspiring example of the tentative rebirth of Russian scientific achievement after the dark years of scant funding and shattered morale.</p> <p>A biochemist by training, Dr Zharikov used to work in the notorious Obolensk Institute of Applied Microbiology - the heart of Russia's germ warfare programme. As international suspicion of the institute's activities grew and Russia's defence industry was severely cut, the institute's work was severely restricted in the early 90s and hundreds of highly qualified weapons scientists faced unemployment.</p> <p>Some went to work in banks, others to trade goods in the local market, but one enterprising group formed a collective and set up its own institute from the ashes of the defence project.</p> <p>With no government funding, they looked for private contracts and grants. The International Science and Technology Centre, set up after the Soviet Union collapsed to \"prevent experts in weapons of mass destruction from defecting to rogue states and passing on their knowledge\", readily provided support.</p> <p>Dr Zharikov adapted his talents to soil cleansing, focusing on PCB pollution. One of the world's most poisonous industrial compounds, produced globally in large amounts before scientists realised how dangerous they were, PCBs are carcinogenic and cause birth defects and infertility.</p> <p>Dr Zharikov identified naturally occurring micro-organisms which swiftly degrade the contaminants.

      "bodyText": "In the dank basement of a decrepit academic institute in the village of Bolshevik, a grey provincial sprawl 100 miles from Moscow, Genady Zharikov is cultivating worms. Blue plastic washing-up bowls have been converted into breeding farms for 10 different varieties. Dr Zharikov has skinny, pale worms that feed on manure and a darker, fatter breed which eats paper shreds torn from Soviet scientific journals. But it is the small, deep-red coloured hybrid that he is most proud of. The technique he has developed for cleaning industrially poisoned soil using these worms has been hailed as an international breakthrough in environmental science. His successes, and those of the institute where he works, are an inspiring example of the tentative rebirth of Russian scientific achievement after the dark years of scant funding and shattered morale. A biochemist by training, Dr Zharikov used to work in the notorious Obolensk Institute of Applied Microbiology - the heart of Russia's germ warfare programme. As international suspicion of the institute's activities grew and Russia's defence industry was severely cut, the institute's work was severely restricted in the early 90s and hundreds of highly qualified weapons scientists faced unemployment. Some went to work in banks, others to trade goods in the local market, but one enterprising group formed a collective and set up its own institute from the ashes of the defence project. With no government funding, they looked for private contracts and grants. The International Science and Technology Centre, set up after the Soviet Union collapsed to \"prevent experts in weapons of mass destruction from defecting to rogue states and passing on their knowledge\", readily provided support. Dr Zharikov adapted his talents to soil cleansing, focusing on PCB pollution. One of the world's most poisonous industrial compounds, produced globally in large amounts before scientists realised how dangerous they were, PCBs are carcinogenic and cause birth defects and infertility. Dr Zharikov identified naturally occurring micro-organisms which swiftly degrade the contaminants. The specially bred earthworms will eat the micro-organisms and leave the earth dramatically cleaner. This ingeniously simple method of speeding up the natural process of soil self-purification has caused excitement in Europe and the institute is already receiving orders for the process from abroad. Delighted with his achievement in straitened times, Dr Zharikov is optimistic about the future of Russian science. \"It has been a difficult time, but for those who persisted, the worst years are over,\" he said. For the first time since the early 90s, no scientists took to the streets last year to complain about delayed salary payments and funding cuts. A pragmatic, forward-looking sect of Russian academics insists that nostalgia for a Soviet scientific golden age is wholly misplaced, arguing that the free flow of government money during that era encouraged wasteful and unnecessary research. Vladimir Malyukh, a software entrepreneur and former nuclear engineer, explained: \"We had too great an emphasis on pure science. We had a huge amount of knowledge, but we didn't know how to apply it. \"Again and again you can see the results of this - we were the first country in space, but we still have no technology now for satellite television. \"Politicians were more interested in show results - to prove to the world what the Soviet Union was capable of - not in results that could be used by the population.\" The Soviet Union's spaceships, military aerospace technology and atomic weaponry all matched or surpassed world standards. But the televisions and fridges built for its huge population were riddled with faults. The harsher new environment of a consumer society is beginning, slowly, to remove this imbalance. Along the corridor, Konstantin Soloviev, 67, a former weapons engineer and aerosols specialist who worked with anthrax, plagues and other highly infectious diseases in the Obolensk institute, is another proponent of Russia's new scientific climate. Recently he has converted his skills to developing ways of administering flu, whooping cough, measle and other vaccines using aerosols as a swifter, less painful method than injections.

      "bodyText": "A powerful coalition of big businesses, trade unions, and environmental and human rights groups meets in New York today to cement the Global Compact for ethical behaviour in business launched last year by Kofi Annan. The Global Compact has the potential to make bigger changes for the poor around the world than traditional aid programmes have ever done. The UN secretary general has managed to hold together some unlikely allies in the Global Compact. Among the 40 or more big companies that have sent top executives to the meeting are Ericsson of Sweden, Tata of India, and multinationals such as BP, Shell, Nike, Rio Tinto, Volvo, Daimler-Chrysler, Unilever, Dupont, Bayer and British Telecom. Scandinavia, Britain, France and Germany have responded enthusiastically, far better than US business. Japan has not responded at all. Their partners in New York include Amnesty, Transparency International, the Prince of Wales Forum on GM Foods, the heads of labour confederations, and various human rights organisations. The first initiative is Ericsson's promise to 140 countries to ensure emergency communications in a disaster such as earthquake or flood. Another, from Health InterNet Work, is the creation of 10,000 sites for telemedicine. These and other projects will be posted on the Global Compact website. \"It's an exercise in transparency,\" says John Ruggie, a UN assistant secretary general and Mr Annan's special adviser on the Global Compact.
