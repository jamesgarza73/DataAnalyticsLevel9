I used to pore over files because I always thought that was the best way to impress a boss, but communication is the key to success. When you're new you have the advantage of not knowing all the answers, so you can ask as many questions as you want. Colleagues and clients can forgive you if you have no solutions, so they're happy to give you answers. Also, it's flattering to people if you come to them for advice rather than tell them exactly what you are going to do. That way you can build up better working relationships. </p> <p> <strong> John Hilton, 45</strong> PR manager </p> <p> I think you can be over-eager when you join a new company. Of course it's important to be keen, but it's much more important to listen and watch colleagues rather than offer opinions. I once got on the wrong side of a boss at work by harassing him with all these wonderful half-baked ideas for new projects, and I got in the way rather than helped. A new person with lots of bright ideas can be terribly wearing. My advice? Ask people what they want doing and do it. Gradually they'll respect you and listen to your suggestions. </p> <p> <strong> Tim Williams, 42</strong> company director </p> <p> I think the key to starting a job well is to do your research. Find out exactly who does what and who your clients are if you're going to work for a large organisation. And make sure you know who everyone is - not just the people in your chain of command, but everyone in the company who you're working with. There is nothing less impressive than having to constantly remind a new recruit who's who in the marketing team. Also, memorise the clients' business, think about their needs and how you can add to the service your company provides. Of course, you have to do some of this at the interview stage, but bosses are always impressed when new recruits do more homework. </p> <p> <strong> Katie Barnes, 23</strong> marketing executive </p> <p> I think a lot of career success comes from having a face that fits. In my last job I bluffed my way through the interview and didn't really have a clue what I was doing. But I acted as though I did, watched what my colleagues did or charmed them into helping me. I think if you are amenable and enthusiastic you can get away with most things, but you have to learn quickly.

The 1.6% rise during September undercut the assumption that the price boom of recent years had reached a plateau. The Bank of England, which starts its monthly review of interest rates today, has been concerned that higher house prices encourages people to save less and spend more, fuelling a consumer boom that can quickly run out of control. These fears were cited among others for its decision to raise rates four times between September 1999 and February this year. But with the Nationwide Building Society releasing conflicting figures, citing a 0.4% gain last month, most analysts believe the Bank of England will overcome its concern and follow its American counterpart in keeping policy steady. The Halifax - Britain's biggest mortgage lender - said that house prices rose by 1.6% in September to stand 9.2% higher on the year. That compares with growth of 0.5% in August, and an annual rate of 7.4%. Nationwide Building Society figures for last month show a smaller 0.4% gain in house prices.

      "body": "<p>On The Town was Leonard Bernstein's first Broadway show, which opened in December 1944. He called it a musical comedy; the story of three sailors on 24-hour shore leave experiencing New York for the first time and looking for love and adventure. </p> <p> It was developed out of the ballet Fancy Free, which he had written earlier the same year for Jerome Robbins. Adolph Green and Betty Comden were recruited to provide the lyrics, and the show was a huge success. </p> <p> Now, though, it is best known through the film version with Gene Kelly, made five years after the premiere.</p> <p> But that has a very different score from the original, and for the three Festival Hall performances, with the BBC Concert Orchestra and Paul Daniel conducting, On the Town was being heard as Bernstein originally intended, complete with the strange little intermission song and the ballet sequences (which the composer later turned into a self-standing concert work) as well as the enduring numbers like New York, New York, and Lonely Town.

      "bodyText": "On The Town was Leonard Bernstein's first Broadway show, which opened in December 1944. He called it a musical comedy; the story of three sailors on 24-hour shore leave experiencing New York for the first time and looking for love and adventure. It was developed out of the ballet Fancy Free, which he had written earlier the same year for Jerome Robbins. Adolph Green and Betty Comden were recruited to provide the lyrics, and the show was a huge success. Now, though, it is best known through the film version with Gene Kelly, made five years after the premiere. But that has a very different score from the original, and for the three Festival Hall performances, with the BBC Concert Orchestra and Paul Daniel conducting, On the Town was being heard as Bernstein originally intended, complete with the strange little intermission song and the ballet sequences (which the composer later turned into a self-standing concert work) as well as the enduring numbers like New York, New York, and Lonely Town. There was no dancing at the Festival Hall. This was a semi-staging, and a very effective one, devised by Annilese Miskimmon, with lighting effects, costumes, and all the necessary exits and entrances, and Daniel made it fizz along. The cast was an excellent one too. The three sailors, Gabey, Chip, and Ozzie, were sung and acted by Brent Barrett, Graham Bickley and Karl Dymond with exactly the right kind of boyish, gauche enthusiasm, and Barrett especially treated his two solo numbers, the most beautiful in the score, with all the refinement they deserve.

North by Seamus Heaney (1975)</strong><br>The authentic Heaney voice, at once earthy and ethereal.</p> <p><strong>10.

      "bodyText": "Andrew Motion is currently poet laureate. Read some of Andrew Motion's recent poems (including Picture this: For the 100th birthday of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother) in the poetry archive. 1. Lyrical Ballads by Anon (1798) In fact by Wordsworth and Coleridge (who had only four poems in the volume); a defining moment in the Romantic revolution, and the evolution of our distinctly modern age. 2. Lamia, Isabella, The Eve of St Agnes and Other Poems by John Keats (1820) The title speaks for itself, especially when we remember those 'other poems' include the great odes. 3. Poems, Chiefly Lyrical by Alfred (not yet Lord) Tennyson (1830) Why did Auden call Tennyson the stupidest English poet? This collection is crammed with evidence of a wonderfully intelligent heart. 4. Leaves of Grass by Walt Whitman (1855) This blows apart what 'lyrical' might mean, instigating its own extraordinary traditions as it adapts existing ones. 5. North of Boston by Robert Frost (1914) An example of how the most intense kind of personal poetry and the most general kind of narrative can be brought together to create stories at once beautiful and true. 6. Poems by Edward Thomas (1917) The volume that contains (among other things) As the Team's Head-Brass, the sort of quiet-speaking masterpiece that made Thomas one of the most influential and best-loved 20th century poets. 7. Poems by WH Auden (1930) The eruption of a completely new-sounding voice, yet resonant with the echoes of older voices. 8. The Less Deceived by Philip Larkin (1955) His first 'mature' volume; the distinctive sad music of post-war British life. 9. North by Seamus Heaney (1975) The authentic Heaney voice, at once earthy and ethereal. 10. Complete Poems by Elizabeth Bishop (1983) A lifetime's immaculate adventuring.",

Though this ballet, made in 1989, was Preljocaj's first attempt at a large-scale narrative, its 90 minutes are sustained by some startling, and intensely musical dance invention.

Were they really moved to pity and fear by this? </p> <p> It's possible that one day Orph\u00e9e et Eurydice will be vindicated afresh for today's audiences. But it will need a stronger performance, and a much stronger production than the one currently on offer from Welsh National Opera. </p> <p> A line-up that includes Katerina Karn\u00e9us in the title role, with the lively and intelligent baroque specialist Paul McCreesh as conductor, promises well. McCreesh's arguments for reviving the 1859 Berlioz version of the opera made a lot of sense, and he directed it with conviction. Unfortunately the WNO's playing sparked sporadically - it wasn't all perfectly polished either.</p> <p> Karn\u00e9us, agile as ever, managed a decent show of feeling as Orph\u00e9e, but there was a lack of power in the lower reaches of the voice where details were often smothered by the orchestra. Natalie Christie was a firmer, sweet-toned if somewhat characterless Eurydice. </p> <p> Only Jeni Bern as the god L'Amour hit the mark exactly: musically, expressively, dramatically.

All poor Orph\u00e9e had to do in the opening tomb scene was to change position from number to number: beginning in a stiff standing posture, ending prone on the ground - a variant of the lifeless old operatic stand-and-deliver technique. </p> <p> The dance numbers weren't much better. The Spectres and Furies of Hades, decked out like mutant new age travellers, run around in groups and gesture decorously enough, but it's all very camp and frothy, with an occasional stale whiff of Pan's People.

      "body": "<p>Barely have our Olympic team stepped off the plane and already someone is taking a pin to the bubble of national pride we have from the Sydney games. According to a report out this week, British workers should be given a medal of their own - for being among the most miserable in the world. </p> <p>In a survey of more than 200 international businesspeople, just 25% of Britons said they were happy at work, compared with 54% of Americans. Furthermore, while more than 80% of the Australian and French respondents - and 100% of the Americans - cited their home among the top countries in the world in which to work, only 38% of Britons did so. And in the overall vote on the most miserable country in which to work, Britain took bronze, coming third after China and Japan. </p> <p>The list of statistics goes on, with British workers consistently rating our western working counterparts as having more blessed working lives than us. It is a damning indictment of our own job market, but one which is hardly surprising when you scour the lengthy list of complaints that arise out of the way we work. We may be used to working the longest and most insecure days in Europe, but the message of this research is clear: we don't have to like it. </p> <p>Carolyn Asome, who used to teach in France, can relate to the research. Recalling her days there with fondness, she says: \"Over there the working conditions are so much better. The hours are shorter, the job security is stronger and there are really good state benefits - if you don't earn over a certain amount you get a great rebate for your rent,\" she says. \"All the time I was there, unions were fighting for better conditions. They were really successful, but the irony is the conditions are far worse over here.\" </p> <p>Likewise, Clare Macfarlane, an advertising account executive, enjoyed the relaxing year she spent working in Australia. \"There was a definite mass exodus from the office at five o'clock every day, and it's certainly not like that over here,\" she says. Even the managing director took a relaxed approach to the company commitments: \"He was definitely more interested in what he was doing at the weekend. But that could be to do with the quality of life in Australia. They definitely get their priorities right.\" </p> <p>Ben Williams, an Edinburgh-based chartered corporate psychologist, preaches a similar relaxed attitude. \"We have to try to have more fun at work,\" he says. \"I spend most of my professional career optimising the performance of people at work, and one of the things that does that best is a willingness to play, share and enjoy. It is something workers in this country really have yet to master.\" </p> <p>Part of the problem with Britain is that our priorities are all over the place. As work dominates our lives, we become more and more subservient by the day. The confrontations between unions and managements are long gone, and in their place sits a drained, clock-watching workforce which does nothing but moan. As Williams puts it: \"We're much less positive about things. We have a less can-do attitude than some of the other parts of the world where they make things happen.\" </p> <p>In France, where unions have fought for high levels of job security, generous state pensions and high levels of company-funded insurance, workers can, of course, afford to be happier. </p> <p>Yet, as in our resignation to the death of union strength and workers' rights, there is a very British defeatism in denouncing ourselves as one of the western world's worst places to work. Given the chance in the survey, other nationalities rated us highly as a good place to earn a crust.

      "bodyText": "Barely have our Olympic team stepped off the plane and already someone is taking a pin to the bubble of national pride we have from the Sydney games. According to a report out this week, British workers should be given a medal of their own - for being among the most miserable in the world. In a survey of more than 200 international businesspeople, just 25% of Britons said they were happy at work, compared with 54% of Americans. Furthermore, while more than 80% of the Australian and French respondents - and 100% of the Americans - cited their home among the top countries in the world in which to work, only 38% of Britons did so. And in the overall vote on the most miserable country in which to work, Britain took bronze, coming third after China and Japan. The list of statistics goes on, with British workers consistently rating our western working counterparts as having more blessed working lives than us. It is a damning indictment of our own job market, but one which is hardly surprising when you scour the lengthy list of complaints that arise out of the way we work. We may be used to working the longest and most insecure days in Europe, but the message of this research is clear: we don't have to like it. Carolyn Asome, who used to teach in France, can relate to the research. Recalling her days there with fondness, she says: \"Over there the working conditions are so much better. The hours are shorter, the job security is stronger and there are really good state benefits - if you don't earn over a certain amount you get a great rebate for your rent,\" she says. \"All the time I was there, unions were fighting for better conditions. They were really successful, but the irony is the conditions are far worse over here.\" Likewise, Clare Macfarlane, an advertising account executive, enjoyed the relaxing year she spent working in Australia. \"There was a definite mass exodus from the office at five o'clock every day, and it's certainly not like that over here,\" she says. Even the managing director took a relaxed approach to the company commitments: \"He was definitely more interested in what he was doing at the weekend. But that could be to do with the quality of life in Australia. They definitely get their priorities right.\" Ben Williams, an Edinburgh-based chartered corporate psychologist, preaches a similar relaxed attitude. \"We have to try to have more fun at work,\" he says. \"I spend most of my professional career optimising the performance of people at work, and one of the things that does that best is a willingness to play, share and enjoy. It is something workers in this country really have yet to master.\" Part of the problem with Britain is that our priorities are all over the place. As work dominates our lives, we become more and more subservient by the day. The confrontations between unions and managements are long gone, and in their place sits a drained, clock-watching workforce which does nothing but moan. As Williams puts it: \"We're much less positive about things. We have a less can-do attitude than some of the other parts of the world where they make things happen.\" In France, where unions have fought for high levels of job security, generous state pensions and high levels of company-funded insurance, workers can, of course, afford to be happier. Yet, as in our resignation to the death of union strength and workers' rights, there is a very British defeatism in denouncing ourselves as one of the western world's worst places to work. Given the chance in the survey, other nationalities rated us highly as a good place to earn a crust. It may well be an outsider's misconception, but Professor Cary Cooper, the occupational psychologist who analysed the research, believes the foreigner takes the correct standpoint. He puts Britain's poor performance in the league table of happy workers down as more of a reflection of the British psyche than of poor working culture. 'We have a very negative view of ourselves,\" says Cooper. \"British people always seem to put themselves down a lot more than other countries. In the same way the Americans show their arrogance by unanimously saying they hail from one of the world's top three places to work, so we British show our self-effacing and demure side by constantly labelling ourselves a national failure.\" It is a conclusion that Williams is equally quick to draw from the findings. \"You can't change the results of 150 years of British social and economic history, and that history has taught us that it pays to keep your place and be humble,\" he says. \"We have a natural reserve about us and a kind of enforced inferiority complex which keeps us down and in our place.

      "body": "<p>A small group of insurers will be \"named and shamed\" and forced to pay compensation on endowment mortgages, the financial services authority said yesterday. But it stepped back from ordering a full review of the policies held by 11m homebuyers. </p> <p>Though 6.4m policies might not generate enough cash to repay mortgages, with a serious shortfall on 1.3m, the FSA said most buyers were no worse off than if they had taken out repayment mortgages instead. Endowments had enjoyed good returns and benefited proportionately more from falling interest rates. </p> <p>Amid widespread dismay that tougher action will not be taken, Christine Farnish, the FSA's director of consumer relations, said: \"There has been quite a lot of poor practice, which is deeply regrettable, and a number of people have been badly advised. But it does not mean they have necessarily suffered a loss for which they can claim compensation.\" </p> <p>An industry-wide review would cost billions of pounds and probably fail to identify a significant number of cases requiring compensation, she added. </p> <p>The FSA is to issue a further report before Chistmas naming a small number of companies where \"mystery shopping\" and enforcement visits identified poor advice and serious breaches of rules. They are thought to number about 10 insurers, rather than building societies, and include some household names. </p> <p>The FSA says guilty companies are likely to be forced to restore homeowners to the financial position equivalent to having taken out a repayment mortgage, including repaying of the shortfall. They are also likely to be reprimanded, fined and possibly restricted from selling certain types of policy. </p> <p>The FSA yesterday issued a new factsheet, outlining how policyholders can take cases for compensation firstly to insurers and then to the financial services ombudsman - but not the FSA. Yesterday the ombudsman's office said it had received more than 5,000 complaints and expected more. </p> <p>The Consumers' Association said the FSA figures proved the scale of the problem was \"staggering\". </p> <p>The association's director, Sheila McKechnie, said: \"This is a 'no progress' report from the FSA. It is time for the FSA to get tough on behalf of millions of consumers and not let guilty firms get away with bad practice.\" </p> <p>The association criticised the methodology used by the FSA to suggest that endowment holders were no worse off. It said: \"The FSA calculations are biased in favour of endowments. For example, they have given the value of endowments assuming the charges are spread over 25 years, when everybody knows the charges are stacked up at the front. To say you are no worse off is unrealistic.\" </p> <p>Insurance companies - which have paid out \u00a313bn to people missold personal pensions - were relieved to have avoided another review. </p> <p>The Association of British Insurers criticised scaremongering by the press and said: \"Having looked thoroughly at this matter, the FSA has found no evidence to change its view, with which we agree, that on average people have done well with endowment mortgages.\" </p> <p>The decision not to force a review may prompt court action against insurers. One legal firm, Joseph Aaron &amp; Co, plans a group action on behalf of 200 policyholders with shortfalls. </p> <p>Mr Aaron said: \"People were sold endowment policies with the specific aim of repaying a mortgage and giving them a lump sum at the end.

      "bodyText": "A small group of insurers will be \"named and shamed\" and forced to pay compensation on endowment mortgages, the financial services authority said yesterday. But it stepped back from ordering a full review of the policies held by 11m homebuyers. Though 6.4m policies might not generate enough cash to repay mortgages, with a serious shortfall on 1.3m, the FSA said most buyers were no worse off than if they had taken out repayment mortgages instead. Endowments had enjoyed good returns and benefited proportionately more from falling interest rates. Amid widespread dismay that tougher action will not be taken, Christine Farnish, the FSA's director of consumer relations, said: \"There has been quite a lot of poor practice, which is deeply regrettable, and a number of people have been badly advised. But it does not mean they have necessarily suffered a loss for which they can claim compensation.\" An industry-wide review would cost billions of pounds and probably fail to identify a significant number of cases requiring compensation, she added. The FSA is to issue a further report before Chistmas naming a small number of companies where \"mystery shopping\" and enforcement visits identified poor advice and serious breaches of rules. They are thought to number about 10 insurers, rather than building societies, and include some household names. The FSA says guilty companies are likely to be forced to restore homeowners to the financial position equivalent to having taken out a repayment mortgage, including repaying of the shortfall. They are also likely to be reprimanded, fined and possibly restricted from selling certain types of policy. The FSA yesterday issued a new factsheet, outlining how policyholders can take cases for compensation firstly to insurers and then to the financial services ombudsman - but not the FSA. Yesterday the ombudsman's office said it had received more than 5,000 complaints and expected more. The Consumers' Association said the FSA figures proved the scale of the problem was \"staggering\". The association's director, Sheila McKechnie, said: \"This is a 'no progress' report from the FSA. It is time for the FSA to get tough on behalf of millions of consumers and not let guilty firms get away with bad practice.\" The association criticised the methodology used by the FSA to suggest that endowment holders were no worse off. It said: \"The FSA calculations are biased in favour of endowments. For example, they have given the value of endowments assuming the charges are spread over 25 years, when everybody knows the charges are stacked up at the front. To say you are no worse off is unrealistic.\" Insurance companies - which have paid out \u00a313bn to people missold personal pensions - were relieved to have avoided another review. The Association of British Insurers criticised scaremongering by the press and said: \"Having looked thoroughly at this matter, the FSA has found no evidence to change its view, with which we agree, that on average people have done well with endowment mortgages.\" The decision not to force a review may prompt court action against insurers. One legal firm, Joseph Aaron &amp; Co, plans a group action on behalf of 200 policyholders with shortfalls. Mr Aaron said: \"People were sold endowment policies with the specific aim of repaying a mortgage and giving them a lump sum at the end. That was the contract, and that is what they are bound by.\"",

Atlanta hosted the \"and there's the British girl coming in a valiant seventh\" games. And in the post-mortem to humiliation back in 1996, many of the participating sports bodies made the kind of major changes to the way they were run that was needed to achieve results. </p> <p>On Saturday, the England football team begins the long march from its own Atlanta: Euro 2000. It was a shambolic performance in which, had there been medals for taking part, England's players would probably have dropped theirs at the presentation ceremony. </p> <p>Add to that the administrative disappointment of failing to land the 2006 World Cup, and the stock of English football internationally has rarely been lower. Oddly, Adam Crozier, the FA chief executive who has been in charge of the English game for nine months now, believes this is no bad place to start. </p> <p>\"In the long run what happened at Euro 2000 might be a good thing,\" he says. \"In the past what has tended to happen is we've had glorious failure, and the glory hides the failure. Euro 2000 hurt. What it really did was focus everyone's minds on the kind of longer-term thinking we need to take if we're going to achieve success. These are decisions France took 10-12 years ago and they've reaped the benefit since.\" </p> <p>And there is no question Crozier has set out to give the FA the kind of direction and sense of purpose that used to be entirely lacking in the moribund, arthritic organisation. He has streamlined operations, removed tiers of bureaucracy, introduced internal audits and performance targets. There is even soon to be a move from the creaking old headquarters in Lancaster Gate to state-of-the-art Soho offices, complete with a swanky atrium to host FA Cup draws. And to sharpen minds he has set the organisation a target: winning the 2006 World Cup. Which, given the current state of the game in this country, makes William Hague's assertion that he will snatch the next election look a racing certainty by comparison. At the moment English players barely make up a quorum in our leading clubs, and here is the chief executive of the FA proposing that in a mere six years' time there will be enough native talent around to see off the collective endeavours of France, Italy, Spain, Brazil and Argentina. </p> <p>In his softly persuasive Scots burr Crozier says: \"2006 isn't plucked out of nowhere. It's a timetable tied in with the players coming through the academy system ready to meet the Owens and Coles absolutely at their peak. One of the most important ways of preparing players for the future is to qualify for every tournament. That's why these two games coming up [against Germany and Finland] are so crucial. But to achieve the goal will require patience.\" </p> <p>Ah, patience. Not a virtue much in evidence in English football, as exemplified by the FA committee member Ken Bates or, indeed, representatives of the press. If things go as wrong on Saturday as they did in Euro 2000 there will be plenty advising that patience should be tempered with realism. Defeat against Germany, and even more so against Finland the following Wednesday, will have many suggesting that the long-term future of the England team would be better off in a different pair of hands. </p> <p>\"I've said this I don't know how many times,\" says Crozier. \"We believe in Kevin [Keegan], we're 100% behind him. Don't forget the position he took over. Things were a bit of a mess. There was a lot of unhappiness in the squad, players weren't playing for the manager, and he pulled that round and qualified for Euro 2000. Yes, it didn't go as well as we hoped, but look at it in club terms and he's not yet a quarter of the way into one season. I'm absolutely convinced he is the right person to take us forward.\" </p> <p>Forward is a favourite Crozier word. He uses it constantly as he talks about the investment the FA is making in grassroots football (\u00a3125m a year from next year, compared with only \u00a33m in 1998). He uses it to describe the youth academy system now in place, and to talk about the essential need for quality coaching of junior players. He is also looking forward to a mooted new national football centre, along the lines of Clairefontaine, a place which, he says \"is at the root of every French success these past five years\". </p> <p>But it is in the nature of English football that, however keen we are to look to the future, the past has a habit of intruding. This Saturday will be no exception: the last game at Wembley against the old enemy. The two teams will be led out by Franz Beckenbauer and Bobby Charlton, a reminder not just of past clashes on the pitch but more recent battles over 2006. </p> <p>\"It's very difficult going into a match like this,\" says Crozier. \"Like everyone, I love Wembley, I get nostalgic. But I'm very aware I get the best seat in the house. All you need to do to put that nostalgia in perspective is go and sit behind the goal, take a walk round and look at the facilities and you instantly recognise that that is not the place where people should be watching football. So I think we're doing the right thing by rebuilding the place. And if you were going to choose a way to close Wembley, what a way to do it: a World Cup game against Germany. It'll be a great occasion, but more importantly it will be a great game and that's the thing to focus on.\" </p> <p>And what about the suggestion from Kate Hoey, the minister for sport, last week that the new Wembley might yet get a running track and become the centre of a bid for the 2012 Olympics? </p> <p>\"I'm ignoring that,\" he smiles. \"Wembley will be a football stadium and we want it to be the finest in the world. In the future, nothing else will do.\" </p> <p>And on Saturday, we will get the first opportunity to see how far into their chief executive's future the England football team have really travelled. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Defeat against Germany, and even more so against Finland the following Wednesday, will have many suggesting that the long-term future of the England team would be better off in a different pair of hands. \"I've said this I don't know how many times,\" says Crozier. \"We believe in Kevin [Keegan], we're 100% behind him. Don't forget the position he took over. Things were a bit of a mess. There was a lot of unhappiness in the squad, players weren't playing for the manager, and he pulled that round and qualified for Euro 2000. Yes, it didn't go as well as we hoped, but look at it in club terms and he's not yet a quarter of the way into one season. I'm absolutely convinced he is the right person to take us forward.\" Forward is a favourite Crozier word. He uses it constantly as he talks about the investment the FA is making in grassroots football (\u00a3125m a year from next year, compared with only \u00a33m in 1998). He uses it to describe the youth academy system now in place, and to talk about the essential need for quality coaching of junior players. He is also looking forward to a mooted new national football centre, along the lines of Clairefontaine, a place which, he says \"is at the root of every French success these past five years\". But it is in the nature of English football that, however keen we are to look to the future, the past has a habit of intruding. This Saturday will be no exception: the last game at Wembley against the old enemy. The two teams will be led out by Franz Beckenbauer and Bobby Charlton, a reminder not just of past clashes on the pitch but more recent battles over 2006. \"It's very difficult going into a match like this,\" says Crozier. \"Like everyone, I love Wembley, I get nostalgic. But I'm very aware I get the best seat in the house. All you need to do to put that nostalgia in perspective is go and sit behind the goal, take a walk round and look at the facilities and you instantly recognise that that is not the place where people should be watching football. So I think we're doing the right thing by rebuilding the place. And if you were going to choose a way to close Wembley, what a way to do it: a World Cup game against Germany. It'll be a great occasion, but more importantly it will be a great game and that's the thing to focus on.\" And what about the suggestion from Kate Hoey, the minister for sport, last week that the new Wembley might yet get a running track and become the centre of a bid for the 2012 Olympics? \"I'm ignoring that,\" he smiles. \"Wembley will be a football stadium and we want it to be the finest in the world. In the future, nothing else will do.\" And on Saturday, we will get the first opportunity to see how far into their chief executive's future the England football team have really travelled. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

February 16: Leicester are thrown out of their La Manga training base after Collymore is accused of letting off a fire extinguisher in a bar. The Spanish resort's bosses ordered the team to leave after the incident. February 17: Fined two weeks' wages for letting off the fire extinguisher and warned about future conduct. Collymore is also required to undertake additional community duties for deserving causes in Leicestershire at the direction of manager Martin O'Neill. The former England international and all the Leicester the players are told to pay all costs of the trip, and additional air fares will be paid for by the players. A hotel bill of \u00a3700 for damage to the bar area will also be paid by the players. March: Collymore scores a hat-trick on his home debut for Leicester in the 5-2 victory over Sunderland. April: Breaks left leg in the 17th minute of the 3-0 defeat at Derby. August: Scores first goal after his horrific injury in a 3-0 friendly win at Wycombe. Targets an England recall, citing Paul Gascoigne as an example of a player who is still on the fringe of international recognition in his 30s. September: The FA confirm that their video advisory panel will meet to review Collymore's tangle with Gascoigne in the Premiership clash with Everton, when the Leicester striker appeared to stamp on - and later elbow - Gascoigne. October 2: Leicester officially accept Collymore's transfer request on the same day that the player is charged with violent conduct by the FA following the clash with Gascoigne.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Influenza, commonly known as flu, is an infection of the respiratory tract caused by the influenza virus. It is highly contagious and is spread through coughing and sneezing. Compared with most other viral respiratory infections, such as colds, flu causes a more severe illness. Typical symptoms include a fever of 38C to 39C (100F to 103F) in adults (often higher in children) and a cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, as well as headache, muscle ache and often extreme fatigue. Most people recover completely within one to two weeks, but some people develop serious and potentially life-threatening complications such as bronchitis and pneumonia. These can occur in all age groups, but the elderly and those with chronic health problems are far more at risk than younger, healthier people. Last year over 20,000 people died from flu-related conditions. </p> <p><strong> Vaccine</strong><br> </p> <p> The government is offering a flu vaccine this year to all people aged 65-plus and to those with underlying conditions, such as respiratory, heart and kidney disease, that put them more at risk. But even if all those who are eligible for vaccination receive it - by no means certain as last year there was only a 50% take-up - there is still no guarantee they will be immune. Targeting the virus is like trying to hit a moving target as it constantly mutates into different strains, through processes known as antigenic shift and drift. Immunity from one strain does not protect you from another and each year in February the World Health Organisation tells vaccine manufacturers which strains are prevalent so they can begin preparing for the following winter. Strains are named after the places where they are identified, and this year's are Panama A, Caledonia A and Yamanashi B. Drug companies are working hard to find an agent effective against all types; various products, such as Relenza, have been launched in this country but none has satisfied the National Institute for Clinical Excellence. They are not available on the NHS. </p> <p><strong> Epidemics</strong><br> </p> <p> Every few years a flu strain emerges that is more virulent than normal, resulting in higher levels of infection and mortality. Last year was a case in point. These outbreaks are commonly called epidemics. The Flu Monitoring Service in Birmingham is reluctant to use the word epidemic as it can cause panic; instead it describes rates of fewer than 50 cases per 100,000 population as unusual, 50-200 as average, 200-400 as above average, and over 400 as exceptional. Occasionally, as in 1918, 1957 and 1968, epidemics hit many countries at the same time. These are known as pandemics.</p>",

Against an incumbent nominee in good economic times - usually a sign that the party in power will stay there - the Republican challenger cannot afford to drop any weapon in the campaign arsenal. But Mr Gore's side worries that too much will be expected of the vice president, and that Mr Bush will benefit just by holding his own. To serve that purpose, Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes called Gore \"the best debater in politics today\". But she could not resist a shot to the contrary, calling him robot-like.",

      "bodyText": "Maths should not be a compulsory subject at secondary school and is no more valuable than sociology, according to an educationist in a study published today. Steve Bramall, lecturer in philosophy of education at London University's institute of education, said maths was \"a restricted and limited means of describing and communicating about the world ... it can be no more than a means to an end\". Mr Bramall argued: \"What is good, what is worthwhile, what is important and what things mean ... are aspects of reality that can't be grasped from a mathematical perspective.\" Other curriculum subjects \"appear more suited to providing the sort of education needed for living an adult life in which deliberation about values, meanings and actions feature\". In the study, Why Learn Maths?, published by the institute, he added: \"Immediately one might think about sociology, a subject expressly committed to developing in pupils an awareness and appreciation of the contexts of moral and political action.\" Mr Bramall said that while \"a calculator, a computer, a friend or an independent financial adviser can substitute for an education in mathematics for instrumental purposes ... I certainly cannot leave it to others to decide what my values are without giving up my much-cherished personal autonomy.\" Mr Bramall's view is echoed by others in the collection of essays. Paul Ernest, professor of mathematical education at Exeter University, said: \"The utility of academic and school mathematics in the modern world is greatly overestimated.\" He argued: \"Of course there is a need for a small elite who control the information systems and mechanisms, and a group of specialist technicians to service or programme them. However, this group represents a tiny minority within society and their very special needs should not determine the goals of mathematics education for all higher mathematical knowledge and competence, ie beyond the level of numeracy achieved at primary or elementary school, is not needed by the majority of the populace to ensure the economic success of modern industrialised society.\" John White, professor of philosophy of education at the institute, and Mr Bramall's co-editor in the study, said there was \"an unchallengeable argument\" that children should learn basic mathematics, but said that could be achieved be getting to level four in tests at age 11. But Eric Blaire, a mathematics inspector in the west London borough of Hillingdon, said in the collection that Mr Bramall's argument was \"essentially naive\" and recommended that maths be taught for the length of compulsory schooling. \"It is the disciplined imagining of mathematics that provides the special form of thinking that pupils need developed as long as possible,\" Mr Blaire said. He added: \"We need to be taught it well until the age of 16 and perhaps longer, so that those who influence the next generation will be positive about mathematics.\" Another study by the institute last month called for a rethink of maths teaching, accusing politicians of underestimating its importance. \u0095 Students' university applications should contain no mention of their school or background to ensure those from independent schools are not the victims of discrimination, headteachers heard last night. In a speech to the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference, Vivian Anthony, the organisation's retiring secretary, warned that it without such a move universities would soon find themselves facing legal action.The conference represents 242 independent school heads. Sir Howard Newby, president of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, rejected the call. \"The more information we have the better.

      "body": "<p>What have British theatre directors ever given cinema? Quite a lot, as it happens. Most notably they've given us The Madness of King George, Trainspotting, Notting Hill and American Beauty; now, in the shape of Stephen Daldry, they've given us Billy Elliot, the latest homegrown film to achieve vertical lift-off. Daldry joins a select but significant crew of theatre professionals - Nicholas Hytner, Danny Boyle, Roger Michell and Sam Mendes among them - who have stepped outside the cosy circuit of the performing arts and taken their chances in the big bad world of the movies. </p> <p>Daldry, the 40-year-old director of London's Royal Court, has been lucky in one crucial respect: he has been groomed for a film-directing career by Working Title, the British-based production company whose product ranges from Notting Hill to O Brother, Where Art Thou? Working Title gave Daldry the prize-winning script of the short film Eight as a trial run in 1998, and Billy Elliot is the first film to be made by the company's \"independent\" arm WT2. But even Working Title were probably surprised by the staggeringly positive reception that has greeted Daldry's debut: sobbing reviews, roaring audiences, and a \u00a31.54m opening weekend box-office take - outdoing Four Weddings and a Funeral. </p> <p>Daldry remains mystified by the public reaction. \"I'm relieved,\" he says, sucking on a cigarette. \"To be frank about it, it was - is - a small budget British film that faced struggles in its making. But it was also a good working context, in that it became very special to the people working on it. It was a real surprise the way the Cannes audience responded to it; in Croatia they responded in the same way. I've just come back from three weeks touring it in the US, and it amazes me that what is essentially a small British film can have such a cross-cultural, cross-nationality reaction.\" </p> <p>Superficially at least, Daldry still appears wedded to the student-company lifestyle for which he was renowned throughout his decade-long tenure as the London theatre world's shining star. He's wearing shorts, for a start, having pedalled down from a meeting at Working Title's Oxford Street headquarters. The hair is blond and neatly trimmed, the brow clear and unfurrowed. If cinema's siren call will change this, only time will tell. </p> <p>He stresses that, in cinema terms, he's still a beginner. \"The other month I did an afternoon at the National Film School, and I felt like such a fraud. I thought: what do I know about this? For me, it's such a new medium. Most of my enthusiasm is quite childish; it reminds me exactly of what it was like working in my early 20s in theatre. I find it genuinely exciting.\" </p> <p>Daldry has yet to adjust fully to his elevation to the film-making elite. Even so, when he acted as master of ceremonies at the charity premiere of Billy Elliot last week in Leicester Square, you could sense the ease with which Daldry handles the spotlight, his confidence before a massive, if largely adoring, audience. Actually this is something Daldry has got used to. His flair for attention-grabbing first surfaced at the Gate in London, an unprepossessing fringe theatre which Daldry turned into the capital's premier works-in-translation venue. </p> <p>Upon being appointed artistic director at the Royal Court at the age of 32, Daldry became a theatre-world phenomenon. (And all this on a Sheffield University education, rather than Oxbridge.) He assured his financial security with his production of JB Priestley's An Inspector Calls - originally for the National Theatre in 1992, but ever since a fixture in the West End and on the international touring circuit. </p> <p>You get the sense he likes being a celebrity, even going so far as to be photographed with his shirt off in a Sunday magazine. He also has an appetite for public life, as evidenced by the colossal fundraising exercise he initiated to finance the renovation of the Royal Court. Intriguingly, it's this aspect of the creative personality, he feels, that film-making has brought out. </p> <p>\"It's a constant process of crisis management,\" he ruminates. \"I'm not using the term pejoratively. In terms of the organisational management of a consistent process of crisis, it's not the same as rehearsing a play. It's a lot more like a going through a redevelopment project at the Royal Court. You're in a process of constant crisis over how to deliver something at the right time for the right money.\" </p> <p>This, it would appear, is the principal factor behind theatre people's achievement in the movies: with the right script and the right support, their proven ability to organise and enthuse within what Daldry likes to call a \"collegiate\" environment can make the difference between success and failure. Working Title's John Finn, who produced both Eight and Billy Elliot, is clear on the point. \"When we made Eight, outwardly Stephen coped well, but afterwards he said it was a bit like Vietnam - he had no idea what was going on. The short was a great experience because he's got a good sense of humour, and the ability to have people pull in the same direction. </p> <p>\"Initially Stephen was frustrated by how long it takes and how many people are on a crew,\" Finn continues. \"But he picked things up so fast, and he is incredibly visual.\" Daldry has clearly found his ideal collaborators, too: Finn; screenwriter (and playwright) Lee Hall; and cinematographer Brian Tufano, the British veteran responsible for Shallow Grave, Trainspotting and East is East. </p> <p>But this doesn't explain Billy Elliot; you can have the best team on the planet and still make a lousy movie. British theatre directors are celebrated for their silver tongues, and Daldry can talk with studied elegance about why he wanted to do Hall's script: \"I liked the idea that it was a full-on emotional journey, and I suppose it was interesting to do something that wasn't doing a take on its subject matter or its characters. Emotion has gone out of fashion in lots of ways.\" But it's not until he starts to talk about the miners' strike that forms Billy Elliot's backdrop, that you realise here is something he really cares about. </p> <p>\"I think it was one of the most important moments of post-war domestic British politics. It's surprised me how there haven't been more films about it. Especially since the time of the strike was one of the most phenomenal periods of creativity ever seen in this country. Poetry, music, theatre.\" Daldry himself was part of that explosion, working on a play called Never the Same Again in a pit village with a co-operative theatre company. The irony that his film has been taken up and praised by the same social forces that orchestrated the vicious media attacks on the miners in the mid-1980s, is not lost on him. </p> <p>'There's a sense across the political board, that the loss of those industries and those communities is elegaic, that something profound was lost that might have been worth fighting for in a different way. There was a great north-south divide during the strike, and a lot of people reacted against what Margaret Thatcher called 'Mr Scargill's insurrection' - the notion that they were the enemy within. </p> <p>\"Ten years later, with that last big march in London against the final pit closures, the miners weren't allowed to use the normal route, and they went down Kensington Church Street. I was there and it was phenomenal. You're in one of the bastions of Little England - it's full of antique shops and coffee shops - and there were people cheering out of their windows and bringing out tea. Suddenly the miners are the underdogs and it's OK.\" </p> <p>But it would be unfair to characterise Daldry as a proselytiser, or even as a sentimentalist. He is, for example, nettled at the mention of showbiz politicians (\"I think it's good when people are 'wheeled out' to say what they feel about things. More people should do it\"). </p> <p>He recounts with glee a story about Billy Elliot's test screenings in the US, in mall-multiplex country. The distributors told him they'd be happy with a 40-average scorecard. The Full Monty got something in the 70s. Billy Elliot, in the end, got 86. That's something no one can argue with.</p>",

In terms of the organisational management of a consistent process of crisis, it's not the same as rehearsing a play. It's a lot more like a going through a redevelopment project at the Royal Court. You're in a process of constant crisis over how to deliver something at the right time for the right money.\" This, it would appear, is the principal factor behind theatre people's achievement in the movies: with the right script and the right support, their proven ability to organise and enthuse within what Daldry likes to call a \"collegiate\" environment can make the difference between success and failure. Working Title's John Finn, who produced both Eight and Billy Elliot, is clear on the point. \"When we made Eight, outwardly Stephen coped well, but afterwards he said it was a bit like Vietnam - he had no idea what was going on. The short was a great experience because he's got a good sense of humour, and the ability to have people pull in the same direction. \"Initially Stephen was frustrated by how long it takes and how many people are on a crew,\" Finn continues. \"But he picked things up so fast, and he is incredibly visual.\" Daldry has clearly found his ideal collaborators, too: Finn; screenwriter (and playwright) Lee Hall; and cinematographer Brian Tufano, the British veteran responsible for Shallow Grave, Trainspotting and East is East. But this doesn't explain Billy Elliot; you can have the best team on the planet and still make a lousy movie. British theatre directors are celebrated for their silver tongues, and Daldry can talk with studied elegance about why he wanted to do Hall's script: \"I liked the idea that it was a full-on emotional journey, and I suppose it was interesting to do something that wasn't doing a take on its subject matter or its characters. Emotion has gone out of fashion in lots of ways.\" But it's not until he starts to talk about the miners' strike that forms Billy Elliot's backdrop, that you realise here is something he really cares about. \"I think it was one of the most important moments of post-war domestic British politics. It's surprised me how there haven't been more films about it. Especially since the time of the strike was one of the most phenomenal periods of creativity ever seen in this country. Poetry, music, theatre.\" Daldry himself was part of that explosion, working on a play called Never the Same Again in a pit village with a co-operative theatre company. The irony that his film has been taken up and praised by the same social forces that orchestrated the vicious media attacks on the miners in the mid-1980s, is not lost on him. 'There's a sense across the political board, that the loss of those industries and those communities is elegaic, that something profound was lost that might have been worth fighting for in a different way. There was a great north-south divide during the strike, and a lot of people reacted against what Margaret Thatcher called 'Mr Scargill's insurrection' - the notion that they were the enemy within. \"Ten years later, with that last big march in London against the final pit closures, the miners weren't allowed to use the normal route, and they went down Kensington Church Street. I was there and it was phenomenal. You're in one of the bastions of Little England - it's full of antique shops and coffee shops - and there were people cheering out of their windows and bringing out tea. Suddenly the miners are the underdogs and it's OK.\" But it would be unfair to characterise Daldry as a proselytiser, or even as a sentimentalist. He is, for example, nettled at the mention of showbiz politicians (\"I think it's good when people are 'wheeled out' to say what they feel about things. More people should do it\"). He recounts with glee a story about Billy Elliot's test screenings in the US, in mall-multiplex country. The distributors told him they'd be happy with a 40-average scorecard. The Full Monty got something in the 70s. Billy Elliot, in the end, got 86. That's something no one can argue with.",

People from around the country - depressives, dropouts, respected football journalists and the like - will travel for miles to hear the motivational guru talk positive about absolutely everything. This afternoon, crowds were thicker than usual - in both senses of the word, ladies and gentlemen - as Koog addressed the important issues ahead of this Saturday's clash with the Teutonic other.</p> <p>To a backdrop of awe-struck silence in which you could hear a pin-head drop, Koog declared his confidence that all 27 players in his preliminary squad would be available for selection in his final squad, which will then be whittled down to his final team (approximately three seconds later). Koog hinted that the XI could see some, undoubtedly positive, changes: \"I think you can probably guess we won't just play one up against Germany. You need experienced players but if the question is will I be afraid to throw in one of the youngsters, then the answer is 'no' - and that includes Joe [Cole].\" </p> <p>Of David Beckham, Koog was equally brave. \"I think he leads by example - the way he plays, the appetite he has got for football.

Sure enough, it popped back up with a statement announcing that Lippi had been dismissed. Then it closed down again.</p> <p>\"I'm sorry for Lippi,\" club vice-president Peppino Prisco later told the ANSA news agency. But he added: \"It was on the cards because of the lack of results and the team's lack of any system of play.

      "bodyText": "This was Michael Portillo's first speech to the Conservative party conference as a front-bencher for four years. Like fans rushing to see their team after it has been promoted, it was a sell out. People could be heard desperately exchanging information about where there were spare seats (\"the balcony's full up\"). All it lacked was the ticket touts. The party faithful certainly got their money's worth. This was a leader's speech. If Portillo did not come to bury Hague, he certainly out-phrased him. This was compassionate Portillo in full plumage, displaying his caring credentials for all to see. Like a song by Robbie Williams, there were many influences. There was Clinton-Portillo, talking to the conference about his \"personal journey\" undertaken when he lost his seat, a journey which enabled him to connect to Britain as it is today. There was Dicky Attenborough-Portillo, who set out his own version of Cry Freedom, alluding to the rich ethnic and cultural diversity of Britain. There was Spanish-Portillo, actually speaking the language and talking proudly of his Spanish heritage. And there was even Pulsgrove estate-Portillo, calling on Labour to stop meddling with young people. Pre-briefing on the speech had spun it as a rounded attack on Gordon Brown. In part, it was. Portillo used Brown's own phrases - \"social justice\"; \"welfare reform\"; \"hard-working people\" - and turned them around to support Tory policies. Impressively, he set out a broadly detailed wish-list of changes he would bring about as chancellor. There is no doubt that Portillo has a clear view of where he would take a Tory Treasury. But he must also realise that his pledge to reduce taxation and match (albeit only some of) Labour's spending plans will be mercilessly scrutinised in the run-up to the polls. It remains to be seen whether Portillo has created a rod for his own back and whether he will be able to ride the coming storm. But more importantly, this speech reflected the tone of this year's conference. While it has been billed as one that prepares the Tory party for government, in reality it is a \"one nation\" conference. Having quelled the party and shored up the core vote, the Conservative leadership - on whom Portillo must have had significant influence - is happily now reaching out to the nation as a whole. Hague has already stressed his own commitment to tolerance; John Major's speech to a fringe meeting yesterday reinforced the line; and in this respect Portillo's speech was wholly on-message. The question remains: is this the real Portillo? The trouble is that when he speaks, he has a tendency to sound insincere. Today, however, he was convincing. Yes, he smiled too much and sometimes inappropriately. But this reflected the genuine pleasure he feels to be within the party fold once more. Portillo is passionately tolerant and inclusive and his body language, reinforced with clenched fists, shows that he is willing to stand up for his beliefs in today's Tory party. Portillo remains fiercely loyal to Hague and the two are close. However, his speech today will have inadvertently set Tory hearts racing, dreaming of tortillas in a sun-drenched euro-free Toryland.

One man didn't recover very well and I suspected his blood sugar was low. We took him to hospital and he was diagnosed as having diabetes.\" </p> <p>People who seek out piercing will often not own up to having conditions like HIV or Hepatitis C. \"We treat everyone as if they have something very infectious, as that's the only way to be safe,\" says Kai. </p> <p>Health issues are not always uppermost in the minds of those who seek out piercings. According to James Glover, a north London piercer who has 24 piercings, aesthetics are a major consideration: \"For some people getting a new piercing is the same as getting a new outfit or a new hairdo. Having a piercing done can be slightly painful and there is a sense of having achieved something.\" </p> <p>After its cult beginnings, piercing has been propelled into the mainstream.

While she believes she was kept in the dark, the Oxford centre, for its part, points out that it operates a policy of duty of patient confidentiality. </p> <p>Vera Brewer was not told, for instance, that after her sister's valve replacement surgery in September, a surgical swab had been left inside her body when her chest was closed post-operation. She also had no idea that there were four further operations to retrieve that swab, or that a DNR (do not resuscitate) order had been made. After Irene Godrey died a month later, all Brewer was advised was that no post mortem was necessary. </p> <p>Vera Brewer is one of several relatives who this week are expressing concern over patients' and relatives' rights to information in the medical arena. In the light of an NHS inquiry, the Oxford centre's chief executive, David Highton, has set out to assure families that his hospital shared all information \"relevant to the care of their relatives\". Yet those relatives believe that that promise was not met. They allude to a \"culture of secrecy\" that patient's representatives have long lamented, adding weight to the push for greater openness in the health service. </p> <p>Joyce Robbins, co-director of the campaigning group Patient Concern, claims to hear stories similar to the Oxford case all the time. She cites the frequent complaint that carers are often denied vital information about their patients on account of the Health Records Act and the Data Protection Act. </p> <p>\"I recently met a man whose wife had cancer and he had to look after her at home,\" says Robbins. \"He needed to know when she was going to be discharged, when she needed to go back for check-up and what she needed as medication. But the hospital said they could only supply her - not him - with the information which was no good because she was drugged up to the eyeballs and couldn't remember a thing.\" </p> <p>This is the paradox of patient protection. While the law entitles any person to see information held about them by doctors and health authorities, nobody else can access medical records without the patient's consent. It is a misplaced kindness that backfires the moment a patient is rendered incapable of giving permission. A family member would have to obtain a court order to get access to a relative's most basic medical records. </p> <p>As Robbins notes: \"It is hospitals trying to do the right thing, but it seems a bit ridiculous that, when you've been lying where there's only a curtain between you and the rest of the ward and every stranger in the room can hear, your family is then denied necessary information for your care.\" </p> <p>The row in April over DNR orders being assigned to elderly patients without their knowledge highlighted new concerns over patient and relative consultation. When the health secretary, Alan Milburn, later stepped into the controversy to insist that hospital trusts produce a document stating their policy, he put an end to the illicit practice but not to the qualms that some doctors obviously feel when discussing such matters. </p> <p>Clare Rayner, president of the Patient Association, says: \"Very often doctors don't tell patients news because it's too unpleasant or because they think it might upset them too much and delay their recovery. It is a culture of silence left over from the 50s, when it was considered good, honourable practice not to tell a patient they had cancer.\" </p> <p>Fifty years on, diagnosis concealment is near extinct in the UK. However, what exists in its place is an equally problematic culture of blame that encourages the masking of medical mistakes by health practitioners. Knowing that hospitals are likely to punish and families are keen for recompense, doctors are less likely to admit their errors outside the surgery walls, she argues. </p> <p>Rayner believes that access to more information from the health service will only be given once we accept medicine is not a 100% accurate science. \"Every screening, every operation and every diagnosis is a gamble,\" she says, \"and we must learn to accept that medical help involves an element of risk if we are to get rid of this face of clinical judgement where individual doctors decide what patients can and can't be told.\" </p> <p>The campaign to assert some control over individual medical notes continues to grow. One system that is commonly advocated is a \"living will\" policy, similar to that which exists in America. In order to assure some kind of control over medical notes, this involves patients detailing who they would and would not like to know about their condition, before seeking medical treatment. </p> <p>\"That's something we are telling people to do,\" says Robbins. \"It's a little piece of authorisation that people just don't think of. Some say it's a bit creepy but I think that, if it's part of the medical procedure as it is in the States, it would save a lot of trouble.\" </p> <p>More ambitious is the policy of the Actions for Victims of Medical Accidents group. Chief executive Arnold Simanowitz says the organisation supports a complete change of system in the UK, whereby conscious patients keep their medical records with them. </p> <p>\"There have been a number of experiments in that area and they have all turned out to be very successful,\" he says. \"There is a lot of anxiety on the part of the profession about patients knowing what's going on, but whenever patients have been informed it has always been a good thing. It would also mean that if that patient dies, their information should go to the next of kin.\" </p> <p>Like other patients' campaigning groups, Simanowitz argues that problems nearly always stem from a culture of secrecy. Realising that openness and confidentiality should both be adhered to he suggests health practitioners should start with the premise \"that you've got to be open and have access to your information\" and only diverge from that when it conflicts with issues of confidentiality. </p> <p>\"It would mean a complete system overhaul,\" says Simanowitz, \"but if you start being open and honest from the start, then the patient, the families and the doctors are much more likely to get a fairer ride.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p> Four years ago Tony Blair promised us a new Britain.<br>He promised taxes wouldn't rise. But they have. <br> He promised shorter waiting lists. But they're longer.<br> He promised smaller classes. But they're larger. <br> He promised more police. But there are fewer. <br> He promised his government would be purer than pure. What a joke.<br> </p> <p> I feel so sorry for the many people who put their hopes in that man. They are so bitterly disappointed. </p> <p> They were sold a dream and it's just not there. And there hasn't been a single word of apology. </p> <p> Well, he did say the Dome hadn't been a runaway success. </p> <p> Not a runaway success? As I recall, that's what people said to me after my defeat in Enfield Southgate. </p> <p> It's four years since I could address a party conference from the platform. A lot of water has flowed under the bridge. We've travelled a long distance since then: I have, you have, the party has. </p> <p> I was devastated by my defeat at the time. It certainly didn't feel like it at the time, but the British electorate did me a favour. My period out of parliament was a chance to connect with the Britain of today. </p> <p> Now, as Shadow Chancellor, I cannot forget those experiences. My job is not just about dry economics. The quality of British life cannot be measured in material terms alone. </p> <p> We are the party that understands how much the world has changed. </p> <p> Our country would be stronger and its people more willing to take responsibility if we had fewer politicians passing fewer laws, raising fewer taxes and intruding less in our lives. </p> <p> Young people reject the Labour Party's bossiness, meddling, banning and regulating. </p> <p> Britain has changed and the Conservatives have changed with it. For new generations of British people, old prejudices have been swept away. </p> <p> The Conservative Party is a party for our times. </p> <p> We are a party for people, not against people. We are for all Britons: black Britons, British Asians, white Britons. Britain is a country of rich diversity. That Britain was on display in Sydney. Athletes of every background united by a pride in Britain, and Britain united by its pride in them. Conservatives don't look for uniformity, but for the qualities that mark people out as individual and exceptional. </p> <p> We are for people whatever their sexual orientation. The Conservative Party isn't merely a party of tolerance: it's a party willing to accord every one of our citizens respect. Why should people respect us if we withhold respect from them? </p> <p> We value people for what's inside them. </p> <p> We heard last week Labour's smears against our policy on asylum seekers. That policy will re-establish public confidence in our controls. That frees us to give a warm welcome to those who come to Britain in fear of their lives. </p> <p> That's how my father came. Britain's willingness to take in refugees defines us as a generous and responsible people. It's a tradition that will be upheld by the Conservative Party. </p> <p> We want people to aspire, to reach the heights to which their qualities can lift them. </p> <p> While I was out of parliament I took a television camera into some housing estates. I saw a lot of poverty. But in a way what shocked me was not so much the absolute poverty for many people had videos and their children wore Reebok trainers. What distressed me most was the poverty of expectation and ambition, the lack of hope for anything better in life to come. </p> <p> But in a Saturday school organised by the black community in Sandwell, I found that aspiration: parents determined that their children should have a chance to fulfil their dreams. And education would be the ladder by which they'd climb. </p> <p> Many Labour politicians climbed that ladder. But now they want to kick it away from others. For reasons of pure dogma, they destroy good schools: grant-maintained schools and grammar schools. </p> <p> But they send their own children to exclusive schools. That's Labour's real policy on education. One rule for themselves, another rule for those they govern. </p> <p> William Hague went to a state school. So did Theresa May. So did I. I had excellent teachers. We weren't intimidated by public schools like Mr Blair's. We thought we could do just as well as they did. </p> <p> No state school should ever feel second class. </p> <p> Every parent knows that a school is only as good as its head teacher. The Conservative way is to trust the head teachers and give them the money to spend as they choose. We will give them the opportunity to create great schools, to lift the sights of their pupils, and to transform their young lives. </p> <p> This is our message to parents and teachers: we will set the schools free. </p> <p> The next generation will want to be more independent in their retirement than pensioners are today. We will give them the chance to put their money into a properly-funded pension. We'll enable future generations to accrue prosperity and share fully in the growth of our economy. </p> <p> We won't fudge welfare reform. </p> <p> Gordon Brown promised pensioners change. They got it. Loose change. 75 pence. And when pensioners sent it back in disgust, Gordon cashed the cheques. </p> <p> While I was enjoying my sabbatical, I worked for a few shifts as a hospital porter. I remember once wheeling a patient to the operating theatre on a trolley. He was motionless and I was awfully afraid he might be dead. But without warning, almost like Frankenstein's monster he sat bolt upright and said, \"What on earth are you doing here Mr Portillo?\" </p> <p> I was experiencing the sharp end of the NHS. </p> <p> Everything was in short supply. There weren't enough wheel chairs. So porters had to horde them. It reminded me of stories of the war, when there was rationing, but everyone mucked in and tried to be cheerful. </p> <p> It was impressive. The doctors, nurses and porters are heroes. But things shouldn't have to be like that. </p> <p> Britain spends too little on health. </p> <p> There's a consensus amongst the parties that we should spend much more money on the NHS. But not on how to spend it, nor on how that money can be supplemented. </p> <p> Labour impose politically motivated targets on our doctors and nurses. No wonder they're demoralised. We would give doctors responsibility, and trust them to spend the money wisely, treating the sickest patients first. </p> <p> Where Labour's horizons end, ours begin. </p> <p> Our neighbours in Europe know that you cannot rely on taxes alone to finance health. They would think it silly that families in Britain are encouraged to spend money on their home, on their continued education and on their retirement, but are discouraged through dogma from spending their own money on their health. So other countries have schemes, for instance organised by trade unions and employers. We'll want to encourage that in Britain too. </p> <p> Well spend much more money on the Health Service. And attract extra money too. </p> <p> Labour are stuck in ancient ideology. As Ann Widdecombe once said, Labour have built a Berlin Wall between the public and private sectors. </p> <p> We will tear down that wall. </p> <p> Liberal Democrats have a policy for health and education too. It's is to make doctors and teachers pay more tax. It's not much of a gift for the NHS. But it's a great gift for every Conservative candidate fighting a Liberal Democrat. Let's hear a round of applause for my old pal Charles Kennedy, the Tory candidate's friend. </p> <p> While I was out of Parliament, I became a small business. The Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise sent me a pile of forms and books and tables that thick. I found it daunting and time-wasting. What a pity Gordon Brown doesn't live in the real world where business people live. </p> <p> We never forget that governments don't create prosperity. Businesses do. </p> <p> Tomorrow David Heathcoat Amory will tell you about our plans to cut red tape. We will make VAT simpler and fairer. Let's stop punishing the people who create the jobs. </p> <p> All Labour Chancellors regulate more. All Labour Chancellors tax more. But Gordon Brown is no socialist hero. He hasn't taxed the rich to give to the poor. He's cynically chosen soft targets for his stealth taxes: hard-working families, people he thought who would never protest. </p> <p> Labour think high taxes give them the moral high ground. They talk of social justice. They believe that money that government spends is always more worthwhile than money that people spend for themselves on their families. </p> <p> But I don't. </p> <p> I believe in allowing hardworking families to keep more of the money they have earned. I believe in allowing them to keep more of their dignity and responsibility. </p> <p> Recently, a man wrote to me, a member of the seamen's union. The union's told him Gordon Brown's taxed the pension fund and he must pay out another \u00a3200 a year if he's not to be worse off in his retirement. </p> <p> Is that social justice? </p> <p> Another man told me he's just retiring. Gordon Brown's abolished the married couple's allowance and age allowance. The man will have to pay \u00a3500 a year more in tax than his brother who retired last year. </p> <p> Is that social justice? </p> <p> In Suffolk last week a mother of four children, a beautician, told me she's been driven out of business by Gordon Brown. She can't afford to fill her tank with the most expensive petrol in Europe. </p> <p> Call that social justice, Mr Brown? </p> <p> There is no social justice in high taxation. </p> <p> The Prime Minister devoted a large part of his Brighton speech to smearing the Conservatives. People long ago stopped believing Mr Blair when he spins his own policies let alone when he falsifies ours. People found his speech not only unbelievable but also disillusioning. Wasn't he meant to bring a new honesty to politics? Why can't he behave like a Prime Minister? </p> <p> Before the election Labour claimed it was no longer addicted to high public spending, that the amount we spend is less important than how well we spend it. They committed themselves to stick to Conservative spending plans, because they knew that our prudence was a foundation of economic stability. </p> <p> But as the events of the last few weeks have shown, this is not a Chancellor whose word is his bond. </p> <p> Our economy has been growing since 1992. That gives us an opportunity to increase public spending. I plan to spend more on public services in every year than Labour has spent in any year. But I don't intend to spend money the country hasn't earned. I will leave room for tax cuts. </p> <p> Labour taxes more and delivers less, and plans higher taxes year after year. Conservatives will tax less, spend better and deliver more. That will be the choice at the next election. </p> <p> We will cut taxes on business, so that they can compete and create prosperity and jobs. </p> <p> We will reform Labour's taxes on entrepreneurs and on inward investment. </p> <p> We will encourage savings, to give people security and self-esteem. </p> <p> We will help pensioners and hard-working families. </p> <p> We will restore a married couple's allowance. </p> <p> We will cut the duty on fuel. </p> <p> That gives you a flavour of my budgets! </p> <p> We will keep an independent Bank of England. We will make it more independent of government and more accountable to Parliament. </p> <p> We will establish a National Accounts Commission to show the world that under the Conservatives there will be no fiddled figures. </p> <p> And we will have an independent committee of economists to give public advice to me on the proper level of surplus or deficit. </p> <p> These measures will ensure honesty, transparency and prudence. </p> <p> They will ensure stable economic policies. They will protect the value of the pound in your pocket. </p> <p> And when I say the pound I mean the pound. For our economic policy will be based on Britain having its own currency and setting its own interest rates. </p> <p> Gordon Brown wants to be the next Chancellor of the Exchequer and he can't tell you whether he wants to control his own currency or not. </p> <p> Labour like to call us little Englanders. Is it likely a little Englander would be called Portillo? I am half Spanish, and proud of it. I am a true European, someone with a love of Europe's different cultures. </p> <p> As the Spanish proverb goes: Antes de que te cases, mira lo que haces. Before you get yourself hitched, watch what you're doing. Look before you leap. </p> <p> The euro plan fails to respect Europe's differences. It shoe horns all the economies of Europe, with their different qualities and cycles and stages of development, into just one currency, and just one interest rate. </p> <p> It threatens to take Europe back to boom and bust. The Irish now have high inflation. But there's nothing they can do about it. When Ireland joined the euro it gave up the right to set its own interest rates. </p> <p> In Germany the economy seems to be faltering. For Germany the single European interest rate is too high. </p> <p> Not surprisingly, one interest rate for all of Europe is wrong for most places most of the time. </p> <p> And here's the rub. Supposing the people of Ireland want to vote against the policies that are driving up their prices? They can't do it. Their elected government doesn't make the policy. The critical political decisions about growth and jobs in Ireland are being taken by the European Central Bank. </p> <p> And who votes for the European Central Bank? No one. It's wholly unaccountable. </p> <p> The most precious thing in Europe is democracy. Mr Blair hoped to bamboozle Britain into joining the euro. He hoped to scare us like children with tales of how frightening it would be to be left out. Denmark has shown that people cannot be fooled or bullied by arrogant politicians. </p> <p> Mr Blair please take note. </p> <p> At the election we will oppose the euro. British public opinion is suspicious of the euro as an unproven piece of political dogma. That is our view. That is the view of the moderate majority. We want to keep the pound. </p> <p> And remember this. The euro is a bright idea recommended by the people who brought us the Dome! </p> <p> Labour is leading Britain in the wrong direction.

      "bodyText": "Four years ago Tony Blair promised us a new Britain. He promised taxes wouldn't rise. But they have. He promised shorter waiting lists. But they're longer. He promised smaller classes. But they're larger. He promised more police. But there are fewer. He promised his government would be purer than pure. What a joke. I feel so sorry for the many people who put their hopes in that man. They are so bitterly disappointed. They were sold a dream and it's just not there. And there hasn't been a single word of apology. Well, he did say the Dome hadn't been a runaway success. Not a runaway success? As I recall, that's what people said to me after my defeat in Enfield Southgate. It's four years since I could address a party conference from the platform. A lot of water has flowed under the bridge. We've travelled a long distance since then: I have, you have, the party has. I was devastated by my defeat at the time. It certainly didn't feel like it at the time, but the British electorate did me a favour. My period out of parliament was a chance to connect with the Britain of today. Now, as Shadow Chancellor, I cannot forget those experiences. My job is not just about dry economics. The quality of British life cannot be measured in material terms alone. We are the party that understands how much the world has changed. Our country would be stronger and its people more willing to take responsibility if we had fewer politicians passing fewer laws, raising fewer taxes and intruding less in our lives. Young people reject the Labour Party's bossiness, meddling, banning and regulating. Britain has changed and the Conservatives have changed with it. For new generations of British people, old prejudices have been swept away. The Conservative Party is a party for our times. We are a party for people, not against people. We are for all Britons: black Britons, British Asians, white Britons. Britain is a country of rich diversity. That Britain was on display in Sydney. Athletes of every background united by a pride in Britain, and Britain united by its pride in them. Conservatives don't look for uniformity, but for the qualities that mark people out as individual and exceptional. We are for people whatever their sexual orientation. The Conservative Party isn't merely a party of tolerance: it's a party willing to accord every one of our citizens respect. Why should people respect us if we withhold respect from them? We value people for what's inside them. We heard last week Labour's smears against our policy on asylum seekers. That policy will re-establish public confidence in our controls. That frees us to give a warm welcome to those who come to Britain in fear of their lives. That's how my father came. Britain's willingness to take in refugees defines us as a generous and responsible people. It's a tradition that will be upheld by the Conservative Party. We want people to aspire, to reach the heights to which their qualities can lift them. While I was out of parliament I took a television camera into some housing estates. I saw a lot of poverty. But in a way what shocked me was not so much the absolute poverty for many people had videos and their children wore Reebok trainers. What distressed me most was the poverty of expectation and ambition, the lack of hope for anything better in life to come. But in a Saturday school organised by the black community in Sandwell, I found that aspiration: parents determined that their children should have a chance to fulfil their dreams. And education would be the ladder by which they'd climb. Many Labour politicians climbed that ladder. But now they want to kick it away from others. For reasons of pure dogma, they destroy good schools: grant-maintained schools and grammar schools. But they send their own children to exclusive schools. That's Labour's real policy on education. One rule for themselves, another rule for those they govern. William Hague went to a state school. So did Theresa May. So did I. I had excellent teachers.

Powernet blamed the collapse on failed efforts to raise finance after it abandoned a \u00a3600m IPO. It was reported to have raised \u00a384m in July this year to fund its expansion plans. It is not clear what happened to this money, although a number of high-profile deals, such as a \u00a313m deal with Cisco Systems and a planned \u00a3150m spend on infrastructure, could have contributed to the cash burn.",

The judge, Mr Justice Fysh, said that in the light of his technical findings after comparison of the two products, Dyson's claim of patent breach succeeded. He added that a Hoover counter-claim that the Dyson cleaner lacked novelty should be dismissed. The parties are to return to court on October 13, when the question of injunctions banning further sales of Hoover products which infringe the Dyson patent will be considered. Inventor James Dyson, who was at court today, said he was also seeking damages which could run into millions of pounds. \"I am very pleased I spent 20 years developing this technology, and I am very pleased to see Hoover - who made a lot of false claims about their product - have been found guilty of patent infrigement.\" Mr Dyson had accused Hoover of infringing a Dyson patent with its Hoover Triple Vortex - a new Hoover machine that works with a cyclone instead of the traditional vacuum cleaner bag.

      "body": "<p>Long after the 50-plus victims of the last spasm of Middle East violence are cold in their graves, arguments will rage over what provoked the bloodshed. Israelis are reluctant to share the widespread Arab view that the spark which ignited the fire was last week's visit to Jerusalem's most holy mosque complex, the Haram as-Sharif, by the vitriolically rightwing Likud party leader, Ariel Sharon.</p> <p>To Israelis, the Haram as-Sharif is the Temple Mount, the very heart of Judaism. Many believe that Sharon had an absolute right to be there, even though the mosque is off-limits to Jews. Today's Jerusalem Post carries an opinion poll suggesting that only 29% of Israelis believe that Sharon sparked the violence.</p> <p>Most, apparently, prefer to believe the official Israeli explanation for the eruption of violence, that it was largely directed by Palestinian leaders in the West Bank and Gaza strip. There is little if any evidence to support that claim, and in any case it does not explain the ominous spillover of violence into Israel itself.</p> <p>There have been riots and gunbattles inside Israel itself, in Galilee and other districts that are home to a large and highly discontented Arab minority, which accounts for 15% of Israel's 6.2m population. Though prime minister Erhud Barak's government is committed to raising living standards and removing discrimination, the Arab community - nearly a million strong - is visibly Israel's poor relation.</p> <p>The most plausible explanation for the resumption of street fighting is that Sharon's astonishingly provocative act was simply the detonator that set off an already ticking bomb of Arab frustration, both in Israel and the Palestinian territories.</p> <p>It is more than seven years since Yasser Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin shook hands on the White House lawn. It is more than three years since their historic deal was supposed to produce a comprehensive peace settlement. Yet still the region is mired in hatred and recrimination, uncertainty and fear.</p> <p>The 1993 accord, negotiated secretly in Norway, was made possible only because both parties agreed to put the most contentious issues on the back burner. The idea was to establish trust, and then make incremental progress towards lancing the boils on the Middle East body politic.</p> <p>That was not a mistake. Indeed, there is every reason to suppose that if they had attempted a full-scale instant agreement, the enterprise would have foundered at the outset.</p> <p>Nor is it true to say that that the deal remains bogged down in its tentative Oslo form. There has been, by any standard, remarkable progress towards the Holy Grail of a permanent settlement.</p> <p>At their Camp David summit in July, Arafat and Barak came agonisingly close to wrapping up a final package. Three of the four outstanding issues, each of them explosive enough to blow the entire process apart, were effectively settled.</p> <p>Barak was prepared to hand over 90% of the West Bank to the control of Arafat's Palestinian National Authority, and was even reportedly offering to cede pockets of Arab-inhabited territory inside Israel.</p> <p>The knotty issue of Jewish settlements was also tidied up, with Israel retaining sovereignty and security control of small patches of West Bank territory adjoining its own borders.</p> <p>There was even agreement on the huge and festering issue of the Palestinian diaspora: the 6m refugees scattered around the region and beyond, most of them living in squalor. Israel was prepared to allow tens of thousands to return to their ancestral homes, with the rest to be aided by an international fund.</p> <p>That left the biggest, thorniest, and most emotional issue: the future status of Jerusalem, which the Arabs call Al-Quds.</p> <p>For decades, Arafat and the PLO have insisted that their objective is a sovereign Palestinian state, with Jerusalem as its capital. Since 1967, when Israeli troops captured the Old City and the West Bank from Jordan, Israel has been equally adamant that the city will remain forever united, as the capital of the Jewish state.</p> <p>Yet even this apparently unbridgeable chasm has begun to narrow. Arafat's people have started to talk of Islamic, rather than Palestinian, control of the Haram as-Sharif. Ehud Barak, even this week as the fighting raged, was talking to the Jerusalem Post about two capitals, Jerusalem and Al Quds, existing side by side.</p> <p>In the international clamour for both sides to call a halt to the fighting and get back to the negotiating table, both Barak and Arafat are under heavy diplomatic pressure to take the last lunge towards a permanent settlement. It is much more likely, however, that they will do what has become second nature over the past seven angry, bloodsoaked years: stitch together a new interim agreement, and pledge themselves that one day, very soon, they really will get down to resolving the future of Jerusalem.</p> <p><b>Useful links:</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Editions/2000/10/02/Features/Features.13098.html\" target=\"_new\">Ehud Barak interview</a><br> <a href=\"http://cgis.jpost.com/cgi-bin/Poll/poller.cgi?pollid=mainp&amp;actn=rslt \" target=\"_new\">Jerusalem Post opinion poll</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.idf.il/english/news/main.htm\" target=\"_new\">Israel Defence Forces</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.israel.org/gov\" target=\"_new\">Government of Israel</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/demographics.html\" target=\"_new\">Israel's demography</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com\" target=\"_new\">Jerusalem Post</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.haaretzdaily.com\" target=\"_new\">Ha'aretz</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.jrep.com\" target=\"_new\">Jerusalem Report</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.palestine-info.net/index_e.htm\" target=\"_new\">Palestine Information Centre</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.arab.net/palestine/history/pe_plo.html\" target=\"_new\">Palestine Liberation Organisation</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.pna.net\" target=\"_new\">Palestinian National Authority</a></p>",

Most, apparently, prefer to believe the official Israeli explanation for the eruption of violence, that it was largely directed by Palestinian leaders in the West Bank and Gaza strip. There is little if any evidence to support that claim, and in any case it does not explain the ominous spillover of violence into Israel itself. There have been riots and gunbattles inside Israel itself, in Galilee and other districts that are home to a large and highly discontented Arab minority, which accounts for 15% of Israel's 6.2m population. Though prime minister Erhud Barak's government is committed to raising living standards and removing discrimination, the Arab community - nearly a million strong - is visibly Israel's poor relation. The most plausible explanation for the resumption of street fighting is that Sharon's astonishingly provocative act was simply the detonator that set off an already ticking bomb of Arab frustration, both in Israel and the Palestinian territories. It is more than seven years since Yasser Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin shook hands on the White House lawn. It is more than three years since their historic deal was supposed to produce a comprehensive peace settlement. Yet still the region is mired in hatred and recrimination, uncertainty and fear. The 1993 accord, negotiated secretly in Norway, was made possible only because both parties agreed to put the most contentious issues on the back burner. The idea was to establish trust, and then make incremental progress towards lancing the boils on the Middle East body politic. That was not a mistake. Indeed, there is every reason to suppose that if they had attempted a full-scale instant agreement, the enterprise would have foundered at the outset. Nor is it true to say that that the deal remains bogged down in its tentative Oslo form. There has been, by any standard, remarkable progress towards the Holy Grail of a permanent settlement. At their Camp David summit in July, Arafat and Barak came agonisingly close to wrapping up a final package. Three of the four outstanding issues, each of them explosive enough to blow the entire process apart, were effectively settled. Barak was prepared to hand over 90% of the West Bank to the control of Arafat's Palestinian National Authority, and was even reportedly offering to cede pockets of Arab-inhabited territory inside Israel. The knotty issue of Jewish settlements was also tidied up, with Israel retaining sovereignty and security control of small patches of West Bank territory adjoining its own borders. There was even agreement on the huge and festering issue of the Palestinian diaspora: the 6m refugees scattered around the region and beyond, most of them living in squalor. Israel was prepared to allow tens of thousands to return to their ancestral homes, with the rest to be aided by an international fund. That left the biggest, thorniest, and most emotional issue: the future status of Jerusalem, which the Arabs call Al-Quds. For decades, Arafat and the PLO have insisted that their objective is a sovereign Palestinian state, with Jerusalem as its capital. Since 1967, when Israeli troops captured the Old City and the West Bank from Jordan, Israel has been equally adamant that the city will remain forever united, as the capital of the Jewish state. Yet even this apparently unbridgeable chasm has begun to narrow. Arafat's people have started to talk of Islamic, rather than Palestinian, control of the Haram as-Sharif. Ehud Barak, even this week as the fighting raged, was talking to the Jerusalem Post about two capitals, Jerusalem and Al Quds, existing side by side. In the international clamour for both sides to call a halt to the fighting and get back to the negotiating table, both Barak and Arafat are under heavy diplomatic pressure to take the last lunge towards a permanent settlement. It is much more likely, however, that they will do what has become second nature over the past seven angry, bloodsoaked years: stitch together a new interim agreement, and pledge themselves that one day, very soon, they really will get down to resolving the future of Jerusalem.

      "trailText": "<p>More woe for Waterstone's | Cherry shortage at HarperCollins | Booker rumours abound | Dynamic pricing comes of age</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>More woe for Waterstone's</strong></p> <p>Whither Waterstone's? Britain's largest bookseller picked the week of the first anniversary of its flagship Piccadilly store to reveal that sales are still falling within the chain.</p> <p>Waterstone's recorded a 3.8% decline in like-for-like sales in its shops during the three months to the end of July, the first quarter of its financial year. By contrast, its sister company HMV managed a 3.9% rise in turnover. It is not the first time that Waterstone's has witnessed a contraction of its business. This latest fall was in fact an increase on the 3.7% decline in like-for-like sales seen in its last financial year. The accelerating decline is a signal that managing director David Kneale's 'three-point strategy', designed to reverse the decline in Waterstone's fortunes, has yet to show any signs of working.</p> <p>Alan Giles, chief executive of parent company HMV Media and former managing director of Waterstone's, attributed the fall to everything from the impact of the internet to lower spending from schools. But publishers, who have borne witness for more than a year to falling morale within the chain after the incoming managing director imposed a recruitment freeze and curtailed individual booksellers' powers to buy books, will have treated the excuses with some scepticism. For those publishers who have recently suffered from Waterstone's destocking policies the response might more properly have been described as schadenfreude were their businesses not so dependent on Waterstone's own performance. </p> <p>Waterstone's problems have been mounting almost from the moment Mr Giles and Tim Waterstone, the original founder of the chain, led a management buyout of the business (alongside the smaller book chain Dillons and the music chain HMV) from their respective parents WH Smith and EMI, saddling themselves with more than \u00a3500m of debt and a nagging requirement to float on the stock exchange. Things might have progressed more smoothly had the American bookseller Borders not chosen to enter the UK market at roughly the same time, signalling the start of a race for space which Waterstone's could ill-afford and which Mr Giles now appears to regret. The fact that Jeff Bezos's improbable proposition of an internet-based bookshop called Amazon proved anything but improbable only served to compound their troubles.</p> <p>That Waterstone's Piccadilly store has not turned into a bookselling Millennium Dome is due, in no small measure, to a public relations machine which shrouds the performance of the shop in secrecy. Some in the trade believe the shop is haemorrhaging money, others that it was a necessary fillip for the group in the face of the Borders expansion. But few regard it as a success. Waterstone's says the shop is trading ahead of expectations, a neat way of avoiding the real issue. The news that Mr Waterstone, now non-executive vice chairman of the group he helped to instigate, wants to buy back the bookshop chain, and seems to have secured backing for a \u00a3250m bid, merely clouds the issue still further. </p> <p>It is doubtful that Mr Giles, regarded as the real architect behind the success of the chain after Mr Waterstone sold it to WH Smith, will want to offload it to his non-executive chairman. But with powerful groups such as Bertelsmann and US bookseller Barnes &amp; Noble waiting in the wings and Mr Kneale's vision clearly not working it can only be a matter of time before Waterstone's is detached from the rest of the group. </p> <p>Waterstone's poor performance was put into harsher perspective when rival bookselling chain Ottakar's released sales figures which showed that the market was perhaps a little more buoyant than Mr Giles would have the outside world believe. </p> <p>Ottakar's, which is about a quarter of the size of Waterstone's, recorded comparable store sales growth of 7.4% during the 26-week period to July 29. For those who need more objective evidence of Ottakar's success and Waterstone's failings, BookTrack, which records books sales on the high street and in supermarkets, has reported that the market was up by almost 10% in the first half of the year. </p> <p><strong>Cherry shortage at HarperCollins</strong></p> <p>Unhappy meetings over at HarperCollins, too, where Victoria Barnsley's efforts to reel in her first acquisition since taking over as chief executive are reported to have proved more problematic than the plucky publisher would have liked. </p> <p>HarperCollins announced earlier this month that it had agreed to purchase \"selected assets\" of the failed mind, body and spirit publisher Element from the receiver. But now Bridgewater Books, the company that created many of the books for Element, has stated that it holds the rights to the publisher's entire illustrated backlist, including works by mind, body and spirit overlords Lillian Too and Yuri Geller. Ms Barnsley, not widely experienced in asset stripping companies, could well find herself with a shortage of cherries left to pick. </p> <p><strong>Booker rumours abound</strong></p> <p>Ms Barnsley should at least find succour from the announcement of the Booker shortlist on October 5, with HarperCollins widely expected to have at least one book among the five nominated. Super-Cannes, JG Ballard's follow-up to Cocaine Nights, is thought to be a strong contender, while Amitav Ghosh's The Glass Palace is proving popular among London's literati. </p> <p>Other titles thought to be in the general vicinity of the shortlist include Michael Ondaatje's Anil's Ghost and Margaret Atwood's The Blind Assassin. Zadie Smith's White Teeth remains the strong favourite, despite some recent negative criticism, although it is questionable whether it will be the choice among booksellers, who generally prefer titles which have not already sold 24,000 copies in hardback to gain the prize and the subsequent sales boost. </p> <p><strong>Dynamic pricing comes of age</strong></p> <p>Meanwhile, bookselling in the virtual realm continues apace with Amazon.com becoming the first online retailer to experiment with what has been termed 'dynamic pricing'. The concept, which helps to explain why companies have invested so much money over the years gathering information about their clientele, involves charging customers what the retailer thinks they should be able to afford rather than a blanket price. Amazon, which reportedly offered DVDs at different prices to different customers, has denied that it was testing a system of pricing based on customer demographics. </p> <p>However, not everyone is convinced by the e-tailer's denials. Internet consultant Vernon Keenan told the Washington Post: \"Dynamic pricing is the new reality, and it's going to be used by more and more retailers. In the future, what you pay will be determined by where you live and who you are. It's unfair, but that doesn't mean it's not going to happen.\" </p> <p>It is hard to believe that booksellers in the UK would ever have the chutzpah (or the sophistication) to try and push up prices in wealthier areas but Waterstone's head office, which likes to think it has an upmarket clientele, must be following events closely.</p>",

      "bodyText": "More woe for Waterstone's Whither Waterstone's? Britain's largest bookseller picked the week of the first anniversary of its flagship Piccadilly store to reveal that sales are still falling within the chain. Waterstone's recorded a 3.8% decline in like-for-like sales in its shops during the three months to the end of July, the first quarter of its financial year. By contrast, its sister company HMV managed a 3.9% rise in turnover. It is not the first time that Waterstone's has witnessed a contraction of its business. This latest fall was in fact an increase on the 3.7% decline in like-for-like sales seen in its last financial year. The accelerating decline is a signal that managing director David Kneale's 'three-point strategy', designed to reverse the decline in Waterstone's fortunes, has yet to show any signs of working. Alan Giles, chief executive of parent company HMV Media and former managing director of Waterstone's, attributed the fall to everything from the impact of the internet to lower spending from schools. But publishers, who have borne witness for more than a year to falling morale within the chain after the incoming managing director imposed a recruitment freeze and curtailed individual booksellers' powers to buy books, will have treated the excuses with some scepticism. For those publishers who have recently suffered from Waterstone's destocking policies the response might more properly have been described as schadenfreude were their businesses not so dependent on Waterstone's own performance. Waterstone's problems have been mounting almost from the moment Mr Giles and Tim Waterstone, the original founder of the chain, led a management buyout of the business (alongside the smaller book chain Dillons and the music chain HMV) from their respective parents WH Smith and EMI, saddling themselves with more than \u00a3500m of debt and a nagging requirement to float on the stock exchange. Things might have progressed more smoothly had the American bookseller Borders not chosen to enter the UK market at roughly the same time, signalling the start of a race for space which Waterstone's could ill-afford and which Mr Giles now appears to regret. The fact that Jeff Bezos's improbable proposition of an internet-based bookshop called Amazon proved anything but improbable only served to compound their troubles. That Waterstone's Piccadilly store has not turned into a bookselling Millennium Dome is due, in no small measure, to a public relations machine which shrouds the performance of the shop in secrecy. Some in the trade believe the shop is haemorrhaging money, others that it was a necessary fillip for the group in the face of the Borders expansion. But few regard it as a success. Waterstone's says the shop is trading ahead of expectations, a neat way of avoiding the real issue. The news that Mr Waterstone, now non-executive vice chairman of the group he helped to instigate, wants to buy back the bookshop chain, and seems to have secured backing for a \u00a3250m bid, merely clouds the issue still further. It is doubtful that Mr Giles, regarded as the real architect behind the success of the chain after Mr Waterstone sold it to WH Smith, will want to offload it to his non-executive chairman. But with powerful groups such as Bertelsmann and US bookseller Barnes &amp; Noble waiting in the wings and Mr Kneale's vision clearly not working it can only be a matter of time before Waterstone's is detached from the rest of the group. Waterstone's poor performance was put into harsher perspective when rival bookselling chain Ottakar's released sales figures which showed that the market was perhaps a little more buoyant than Mr Giles would have the outside world believe. Ottakar's, which is about a quarter of the size of Waterstone's, recorded comparable store sales growth of 7.4% during the 26-week period to July 29. For those who need more objective evidence of Ottakar's success and Waterstone's failings, BookTrack, which records books sales on the high street and in supermarkets, has reported that the market was up by almost 10% in the first half of the year. Cherry shortage at HarperCollins Unhappy meetings over at HarperCollins, too, where Victoria Barnsley's efforts to reel in her first acquisition since taking over as chief executive are reported to have proved more problematic than the plucky publisher would have liked. HarperCollins announced earlier this month that it had agreed to purchase \"selected assets\" of the failed mind, body and spirit publisher Element from the receiver. But now Bridgewater Books, the company that created many of the books for Element, has stated that it holds the rights to the publisher's entire illustrated backlist, including works by mind, body and spirit overlords Lillian Too and Yuri Geller. Ms Barnsley, not widely experienced in asset stripping companies, could well find herself with a shortage of cherries left to pick. Booker rumours abound Ms Barnsley should at least find succour from the announcement of the Booker shortlist on October 5, with HarperCollins widely expected to have at least one book among the five nominated. Super-Cannes, JG Ballard's follow-up to Cocaine Nights, is thought to be a strong contender, while Amitav Ghosh's The Glass Palace is proving popular among London's literati. Other titles thought to be in the general vicinity of the shortlist include Michael Ondaatje's Anil's Ghost and Margaret Atwood's The Blind Assassin. Zadie Smith's White Teeth remains the strong favourite, despite some recent negative criticism, although it is questionable whether it will be the choice among booksellers, who generally prefer titles which have not already sold 24,000 copies in hardback to gain the prize and the subsequent sales boost. Dynamic pricing comes of age Meanwhile, bookselling in the virtual realm continues apace with Amazon.com becoming the first online retailer to experiment with what has been termed 'dynamic pricing'. The concept, which helps to explain why companies have invested so much money over the years gathering information about their clientele, involves charging customers what the retailer thinks they should be able to afford rather than a blanket price. Amazon, which reportedly offered DVDs at different prices to different customers, has denied that it was testing a system of pricing based on customer demographics. However, not everyone is convinced by the e-tailer's denials. Internet consultant Vernon Keenan told the Washington Post: \"Dynamic pricing is the new reality, and it's going to be used by more and more retailers. In the future, what you pay will be determined by where you live and who you are. It's unfair, but that doesn't mean it's not going to happen.\" It is hard to believe that booksellers in the UK would ever have the chutzpah (or the sophistication) to try and push up prices in wealthier areas but Waterstone's head office, which likes to think it has an upmarket clientele, must be following events closely.",

President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt today said that the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, and the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, have agreed to come to Egypt to discuss ways of ending the Israeli-Palestinian violence. Mr Mubarak did not say when the meeting will take place. But David Baker, spokesman for Mr Barak's office, said in Jerusalem the Israeli leader will leave for Egypt on Thursday to attend the summit. Mr Mubarak said the gathering will be held at the Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheikh, where Mr Arafat and Mr Barak met last year and signed an interim peace deal. \"The aim of such a summit is to lay the foundations for a comprehensive settlement for all the outstanding questions,\" Mr Mubarak told reporters during a tour of a major agricultural project in southern Egypt. The outbreak of violence has left at least 51 dead - mostly Palestinians - and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, have agreed to meet the US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, in Paris tomorrow. The two leaders are to meet Mrs Albright separately, but the US clearly would like them to negotiate face to face to defuse a crisis that threatens to derail any hopes for a peace settlement. Meanwhile, reports of a new agreement to stop the fighting will buttress international diplomatic peace efforts.

      "bodyText": "Yugoslavia Russian president Vladimir Putin's offer to hold talks in Moscow between the two sides of the Yugoslav standoff makes the front pages. The pro-Kremlin Nezavisimaya Gazeta (Independent Newspaper) says \"Putin's announcement shows that the Kremlin agrees with the conclusions of the Yugoslav electoral commission - that although the opposition candiate Vojislav Kostunica won in the first round, the secound round should nevertheless go ahead, because no candidate won more than 50% of the votes. This position, obviously, goes against everything being said in the Western capitals\". Izvestiya, another pro-government daily, concludes that it is \"extremely unlikely\" that Belgrade will respond positively to Moscow's proposal. Putin's visit to India Marking the beginning of Putin's first state visit to India, liberal business paper Vedemosti predicts that over the course of the four day trip a series of large-scale arms deals will be announced - continuing Russia's lucrative supply of arms to India, which began in the 1960s and has since then brought Russia some $31 billion income. The Indian government is thought to be particularly interested in purchasing tanks from the Urals. Trud reports that in addition to signing treaties on scientific and technical cooperation and collaboration in the oil and gas industries, Mr Putin is looking forward to receiving an honorary law degree from the Nehru University in Delhi. Most Bank sold Vladimir Gusinsky's Most empire - which includes the beleaguered MediaMost television and newspaper holding - received another blow yesterday, according to Vedemosti, when Most Bank (the business which launched Gusinksy as a powerful oligarch) was sold for just $200,000, a mere one rouble per share. In paying such a knockdown price, the buyers - Vneshtorgbank - have agreed to take on some $500 million worth of debts, the paper reports.

That is the prior test.</p> <p>Whether they pass it depends on the behaviour of a small number of people, who have hitherto conspired to create an impression of unity that works entirely to their own disadvantage. This is, I think, the week that will settle the fate for many years ahead of Kenneth Clarke and the brand of conservatism he stands for.</p> <p>The public impression is solidifying that the Conservative party is not divided. This is quite a turnround. One of the many reasons John Major's party was driven from power was that the voters saw it as a fragmented rabble.

      "bodyText": "This is the week when the Conservatives have decided that they must suddenly prove themselves to be the party of one nation. We shall see. Words can be made to mean what a conference wants them to mean. But before speaking for one nation, the Tories need to be one party. That is the prior test. Whether they pass it depends on the behaviour of a small number of people, who have hitherto conspired to create an impression of unity that works entirely to their own disadvantage. This is, I think, the week that will settle the fate for many years ahead of Kenneth Clarke and the brand of conservatism he stands for. The public impression is solidifying that the Conservative party is not divided. This is quite a turnround. One of the many reasons John Major's party was driven from power was that the voters saw it as a fragmented rabble. The perception of splits is perhaps the most durably convincing of all explanations for the defeat of parties in elections everywhere in the democratic world. Removing the outward signs of disagreement is the task William Hague has worked hardest to complete, at whatever cost in other ways.

      "body": "<p>Government scientists are investigating a potential new problem for Britain's cattle farmers, illness caused by an excess of copper ingested by cows, as ministers consider the verdict of an independent inquiry into how the BSE crisis was handled.</p> <p>Food safety watchdogs and vets are trying to establish why there is an apparent increase in copper poisoning of livestock, although they believe that the risk to consumers is \"very small\". Most cases so far have been concentrated in southern England and Wales and officials are trying to establish whether there has been any significant change in dietary supplements fed to cattle. Copper is a vital ingredient in improving animals' muscle, fertility and production value.</p> <p>The alert over copper poisoning, a previously rare condition, was raised by government vets in a letter to the Veterinary Record, the profession's weekly journal. Fourteen outbreaks have been identified this year and the government is anxious to know about other suspected cases.</p> <p>The vets said their investigations had not found \"grossly excessive copper intakes\" in rations on the affected farms and no single feed type seemed to be involved.</p> <p>Animals struck by copper poisoning tend to suffer liver damage, which affects blood circulation. Symptoms include poor milking, abortion of calves and lack of coordination. The condition has so far affected only older cows, which are not used for food because of anti-BSE measures. In any case, infected offal should fail veterinary inspection in abattoirs, the food standards agency said.</p> <p>\"If you did eat liver with high copper content, you would not eat much more,\" said a spokesman. \"It affects palatability.\" Danger from milk \"is not something we consider a risk\".</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Agriculture said: \"There are concerns because this is an animal health problem but I don't think anyone is concerned about human health implications.\"</p> <p>The revelation coincided with publication of figures showing a further rise in the number of people dying from variant CJD, the condition linked to eating parts of cattle infected with BSE, itself once considered to pose no risk to consumers, and the official handing over of the 16-volume report by the BSE inquiry team, headed by Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, to the agriculture minister, Nick Brown. It will be published later this month.</p> <p>Seventy-seven Britons are now thought to have died from vCJD, including three last month of whom one worked in the Leicestershire village of Queniborough, where there has been an apparent cluster of four deaths. The disease may have claimed 22 lives this year, although postmortem confirmation is awaited in four cases.Seven people are thought to be suffering the incurable condition.

      "bodyText": "Government scientists are investigating a potential new problem for Britain's cattle farmers, illness caused by an excess of copper ingested by cows, as ministers consider the verdict of an independent inquiry into how the BSE crisis was handled. Food safety watchdogs and vets are trying to establish why there is an apparent increase in copper poisoning of livestock, although they believe that the risk to consumers is \"very small\". Most cases so far have been concentrated in southern England and Wales and officials are trying to establish whether there has been any significant change in dietary supplements fed to cattle. Copper is a vital ingredient in improving animals' muscle, fertility and production value. The alert over copper poisoning, a previously rare condition, was raised by government vets in a letter to the Veterinary Record, the profession's weekly journal. Fourteen outbreaks have been identified this year and the government is anxious to know about other suspected cases. The vets said their investigations had not found \"grossly excessive copper intakes\" in rations on the affected farms and no single feed type seemed to be involved. Animals struck by copper poisoning tend to suffer liver damage, which affects blood circulation. Symptoms include poor milking, abortion of calves and lack of coordination. The condition has so far affected only older cows, which are not used for food because of anti-BSE measures. In any case, infected offal should fail veterinary inspection in abattoirs, the food standards agency said. \"If you did eat liver with high copper content, you would not eat much more,\" said a spokesman. \"It affects palatability.\" Danger from milk \"is not something we consider a risk\". A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Agriculture said: \"There are concerns because this is an animal health problem but I don't think anyone is concerned about human health implications.\" The revelation coincided with publication of figures showing a further rise in the number of people dying from variant CJD, the condition linked to eating parts of cattle infected with BSE, itself once considered to pose no risk to consumers, and the official handing over of the 16-volume report by the BSE inquiry team, headed by Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, to the agriculture minister, Nick Brown. It will be published later this month. Seventy-seven Britons are now thought to have died from vCJD, including three last month of whom one worked in the Leicestershire village of Queniborough, where there has been an apparent cluster of four deaths. The disease may have claimed 22 lives this year, although postmortem confirmation is awaited in four cases.Seven people are thought to be suffering the incurable condition. Scientists have warned of a rising trend in vCJD, although they remain reluctant to predict the eventual number of casualties.",

I'd always been on the periphery of the team until Farby [Paul Farbrace] took over. It was an act of faith from him really. We had a really hard time in Australia and New Zealand. The batting was a disaster but the bowlers did OK. I look at the way that I performed and the bowlers generally performed and I think we've built on that. </p> <p><strong> Why do you think you have improved?</strong><br> There are lots of facets really. My mental approach has improved. I've become more self-confident. It is reassuring when the coach [Paul Farbrace] says to you everyone has bad days - it doesn't mean that you are going to be dropped straight away. It frees you from pressure. And a lot of things are coming together for the team - we have worked hard on our fitness and sports psychology. I think we're riding a wave at the moment. </p> <p><strong> How have things changed within the England set up since you first joined?</strong><br> I joined the team towards the end of the New Zealand series of 1996. And things have changed beyond recognition since then. The ECB were on the point of amalgamating with the WCA. Then lots of things were funded by the players. Since then we've become sponsored by Vodafone and received a grant from Sports England, and we have become almost semi-professional. The expectations of what we can do have lifted. Eighteen-year-olds like Laura Harper have far more opportunities. </p> <p><strong> Is it easy to combine playing cricket for England and your profession?</strong><br> Fortunately I am blessed. The headmaster, staff and students are 100% supportive. I will be away for three months and the other staff are going to take on the extra work. They don't get any compensation for my absence and if there was any bad feeling it would distract me from my cricket so it is great. I like a balanced life so being semi-professional is perfect. I wouldn't want to play cricket full time - I love my job and I love my cricket. I enjoy playing and training and when I look at the county scene they seem to lack the freshness and a eagerness for the game that we have.</p> <p><strong> You said that self-confidence had helped your cricket. Does this come from doing a job you love?</strong><br> I think I'm very lucky to do a job that I feel comfortable in. It gives me a sound base and allows me to have a perspective on the game. If we lose an international it is terrible, yes, and it I feel defeat very keenly, but the world goes on. It isn't a third-world famine. </p> <p><strong> How has the dressing-room changed since Clare Connor became captain?</strong><br> I came in when Karen [Smithies] was captain. I think things have changed - but then a change of captaincy often signals a change of leadership direction and emphasis. I suppose I know Clare better and from my point of view I suppose it is easier for me to see where she is coming from. I think the change has given us impetus. The results in New Zealand weren't any better than in Australia [Smithies resigned after the Australian leg of the tour] but I think we all felt that we had entered a new era. </p> <p><strong> How do you think England will fare in the World Cup?</strong><br> People have said that we should be happy with a semi-final place but if you ask any of the team they will tell you that we can win. I think the semi-final is the bare minimum. I think we are on a par with India and New Zealand and that New Zealand are within our sights. I know that we lost 5-0 but our batting was at a very low ebb last winter. Had we put on another 30 or so runs things would have been different. And we can also save runs by not bowling wides and no-balls. Australia are the No. 1 nation but in World Cups bad days happen.</p> <p><strong> How do you find the pitches in New Zealand?</strong><br> The tracks are different. They pitch the ball short of a length so they can get it to lift a little bit. But at the same time they aren't alien to us. We won't get the batting paradises we sometimes get over her but as a bowler that doesn't really worry me. We are going over a bit early to acclimatise for two warm-up matches. I don't see any reason to change the way I bowl - I was successful in the winter and if things are different I will adapt accordingly. </p> <p><strong> How is your batting coming along?</strong><br> We have had one-to-one coaches and I think it is coming on well. I enjoy batting but I'm a No. 11. My career has been brief and relatively unglamorous - going in with 400 needed off the last over, that sort of thing. </p> <p><strong> Any injury worries?</strong><br> I had a niggle in my quad over the summer but that goes with the job. Nothing serious. </p> <p><strong> Who will be the Lance Klusener of the Women's World Cup?</strong><br> For Australia - Belinda Clark, Catherine Fitzpatrick and Charmaine Mason. And for us - Jane Cassar, who Farby acknowledges to be the best keeper in the world. And then Melissa Reynard of the bowlers and Barabara Daniels and Charlotte Edwards with the bat. </p> <p><strong>Do you teach cricket at school?</strong><br> I've started up a girls' team this year which has proved to be very popular \u00d0 I've been getting 20 people turning up to training. They enjoy the game and the team dynamic - there are not many team sports during the summer. At their age it is so important to make cricket fun, to mix the very talented and the less talented.</p> <p><strong> Does being an international help you with your teaching?</strong><br> They take the rip out of me - newspaper cuttings appear on various boards round the school. But at the same time it gets me respect that I don't need to work for. There are not that many well-known female athletes and most of the ones the kids have heard of are fairly remote. I think it helps that they can look at me and think, I can do that. I've taught boys cricket as well and it has never been a problem except in Australia. Not only was I a Pom but I was a girl too.

Last year, more than 77,000 violent incidents were reported in London alone - one every six minutes. </p> <p>A quarter of all reported violent crime is domestic. Half of the women murdered last year were killed in fights with their husbands, and on average a woman will be assaulted 35 times, and nearly always in front of her children, before she has the courage to ring the police. </p> <p>The cost of helping the victims of domestic violence is estimated at \u00a32bn a year. Stratton's team is in the frontline.

Officers are loath to stereotype, but in their experience, Asian women are the most reluctant to come forward. One local victim suffered 40 years of abuse before dialling 999. Some Turkish men have been astonished the police regard wife-beating as a crime. </p> <p>Although it is quietish this morning, it gives the officers a chance to talk. Cases they describe as \"typical\" are nothing less than shocking. PC Maria Neeves has called a 29-year-old victim to ask for the return of the panic alarm in her flat. There is a shortage and Neeves needs to give it to someone else. </p> <p>The woman, Alison Smith, is having counselling and would prefer to keep the alarm. But she accepts she is no longer a priority because Peter, her ex-boyfriend, is now in jail. </p> <p>\"I broke off with Peter because I discovered he was seeing another woman,\" she says. \"Even though he had another girlfriend, he couldn't take it. He wanted to get back with me, but there was no way. The trust had gone.\" </p> <p>For the next six months Alison and her mother received anonymous and threatening phone calls. Alison thought she was being stalked. She wondered what lengths Peter might go to. On May 10, she found out. </p> <p> <strong> Attack</strong> </p> <p> The night before, he broke into the empty flat next door to Alison's in Forest Gate. Wearing a balaclava and combat gear, he waited. \"The next morning I opened the door into the hallway to pick up my post. He grabbed me and pushed me back inside. </p> <p>\"First, he stabbed me above the right eye. He used a stun gun on me six times and coshed me over the head. He taped up my eyes and mouth, threw me on the sofa and punched me all over and beat my face. </p> <p>\"He told me if I kept quiet he would kill me quickly, otherwise he would torture me long and slow.\" Fortunately, a neighbour heard the commotion and called the police. Officers found a petrol can in the flat next door but could not link it to Peter. </p> <p>\"I think he was planning to kill me then torch the flat,\" Alison says. Peter pleaded guilty to false imprisonment and was jailed in August for three years. \"With good behaviour, he will be out this time next year,\" says Alison. \"I can't believe that's all he's got.

Getting them to stick to their statements and give evidence in court can be tortuous. </p> <p>It is common for victims to make \"withdrawal statements\" on the eve of trials. Neeves is still getting over the frustration of a case involving a mother who was being abused by an ex-boyfriend, the father of their nine-month-old girl. </p> <p>The man tried to batter his way into her house with a piece of wood and said he would kill her if she dared leave. She did, but he followed her to work. </p> <p>When she left at the end of the day, he ran down the road hammering on the side of her car, terrifying her baby and eight-year-old son. who were with her. That evening, he returned to her house and battered the door again. Then, he smashed every window of her car. She called the police at 9.40pm, saying \"a man was going mad\", and he fled. </p> <p>As officers took down the details, he rang the house on his mobile phone and told one of them: \"I'm going to get someone to blow her kneecaps off and throw acid in her face. I'm going to kill her family ... you know fuck all, fuck off.\" When he was arrested, his explanation was, \"I get angry.\" </p> <p>The case was dropped when the victim agreed to an out-of-court settlement from his family for the damage to her car. \"It's easy to put pressure on a woman, especially if children are involved,\" says Neeves. \"It takes a lot of courage to come forward, especially if your partner is apologising and saying it will never happen again. In most cases, it always does. We know some women who are bound to end up dead.\" </p> <p>Abuse of men by women is extremely rare. Claims of such attacks are almost always made as discrediting counter-allegations.

Does he have the strength to go to court? \"Probably not,\" says Stratton. \"I'm not sure he can go through with it.

She's been working in the field for 17 years, advising women where to get help and whether to pursue their abusers through the civil or criminal court. </p> <p>Newham is a poor area, but she says it is ignorant to assume domestic violence thrives in poverty. \"Actresses, dancers, bankers, I've seen them all.

      "body": "<p>The world's top 10 oil companies, including BP and Shell, will generate nearly $111bn (\u00a375bn) cash this year on the back of booming crude prices, according to financial experts. </p> <p>This embarrassing accumulation of wealth against the backdrop of a fuel crisis could lead to calls from motoring organisations for windfall taxes to be levied on the oil groups. The lobby would seek sympathy from the government, which also feels the oil companies let it down during the crisis. The industry is expected to reduce the size of its money mountain through increased capital expenditure, higher dividends and share buybacks. </p> <p>Investors could get $82.5bn (\u00a356bn) through share buybacks from the 10 largest companies over five years to 2004, according to research by UBS Warburg. The biggest lump of this, \u00a327.8bn, would be offloaded by the world's largest oil group, ExxonMobil, with \u00a310bn by Royal Dutch Shell, and \u00a311.2bn by BP. </p> <p>These estimates, confirmed privately to the Guardian as \"realistic\" by oil company executives, are based on a conservative outlook of world oil prices. The share buybacks could be much larger if crude prices remain strong. </p> <p>UBS Warburg has based its predictions on the assumption that the key Brent blend price will drop from an average of $29 per barrel this year to $17 per barrel between 2003 and 2004. However, it is not just the price of crude that has created the \"spare\" cash. Income growth from cost savings, half of which were generated through an unprecedented level of mergers and acquisitions, have also contributed. </p> <p>The top 10 oil companies, which also include TotalFina of France and Conoco of the US, were 17 separate groups before they amalgamated under pricing pressure in 1998. </p> <p>Yesterday there were signs that corporate restructuring is continuing in this sector with Gulf Canada unveiling an \u00a3800m takeover of rival Crestar Energy. </p> <p>The top 10 oil companies are also benefiting from higher gas prices, better refining margins and improved conditions in the chemical sector where trading has been tough in recent years. </p> <p>UBS Warburg believes this year will prove to be \"as good as it gets\" for the big oil firms, who will spend more of their surplus cash in future on expanding chosen areas such as gas and power projects. </p> <p>Global crude prices could peak over the coming months when they reach $40 or even $50, but experts believe that growing production output will gradually hammer down long term prices. </p> <p>The price of Brent rose again to over $30 yesterday, amid news of renewed tensions between Iraq and Kuwait, and signs that the EU countries were putting aside plans to tap into strategic reserves. </p> <p>Kuwait has accused Iraq of stealing oil from a pipeline laid during Baghdad's occupation of the country ten years ago. Deputy prime minister Mohammed Sharar said yesterday that Kuwait had satellite pictures and field evidence to back up its claims. </p> <p>Brent crude for November delivery moved up $1 to $30.84, while US light crude futures were up 96 cents at $31.71. EU governments failed to agree to sell off strategic reserves last Friday, after Germany expressed doubts about the plan. </p> <p>A final agreement is not expected until the EU leaders' summit in Biarritz, in two weeks time. In the meantime hopes that Europe will follow the US lead and tap its reserves are fading. fading.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The world's top 10 oil companies, including BP and Shell, will generate nearly $111bn (\u00a375bn) cash this year on the back of booming crude prices, according to financial experts. This embarrassing accumulation of wealth against the backdrop of a fuel crisis could lead to calls from motoring organisations for windfall taxes to be levied on the oil groups. The lobby would seek sympathy from the government, which also feels the oil companies let it down during the crisis. The industry is expected to reduce the size of its money mountain through increased capital expenditure, higher dividends and share buybacks. Investors could get $82.5bn (\u00a356bn) through share buybacks from the 10 largest companies over five years to 2004, according to research by UBS Warburg. The biggest lump of this, \u00a327.8bn, would be offloaded by the world's largest oil group, ExxonMobil, with \u00a310bn by Royal Dutch Shell, and \u00a311.2bn by BP. These estimates, confirmed privately to the Guardian as \"realistic\" by oil company executives, are based on a conservative outlook of world oil prices. The share buybacks could be much larger if crude prices remain strong. UBS Warburg has based its predictions on the assumption that the key Brent blend price will drop from an average of $29 per barrel this year to $17 per barrel between 2003 and 2004. However, it is not just the price of crude that has created the \"spare\" cash. Income growth from cost savings, half of which were generated through an unprecedented level of mergers and acquisitions, have also contributed. The top 10 oil companies, which also include TotalFina of France and Conoco of the US, were 17 separate groups before they amalgamated under pricing pressure in 1998. Yesterday there were signs that corporate restructuring is continuing in this sector with Gulf Canada unveiling an \u00a3800m takeover of rival Crestar Energy. The top 10 oil companies are also benefiting from higher gas prices, better refining margins and improved conditions in the chemical sector where trading has been tough in recent years. UBS Warburg believes this year will prove to be \"as good as it gets\" for the big oil firms, who will spend more of their surplus cash in future on expanding chosen areas such as gas and power projects. Global crude prices could peak over the coming months when they reach $40 or even $50, but experts believe that growing production output will gradually hammer down long term prices. The price of Brent rose again to over $30 yesterday, amid news of renewed tensions between Iraq and Kuwait, and signs that the EU countries were putting aside plans to tap into strategic reserves. Kuwait has accused Iraq of stealing oil from a pipeline laid during Baghdad's occupation of the country ten years ago. Deputy prime minister Mohammed Sharar said yesterday that Kuwait had satellite pictures and field evidence to back up its claims. Brent crude for November delivery moved up $1 to $30.84, while US light crude futures were up 96 cents at $31.71. EU governments failed to agree to sell off strategic reserves last Friday, after Germany expressed doubts about the plan. A final agreement is not expected until the EU leaders' summit in Biarritz, in two weeks time. In the meantime hopes that Europe will follow the US lead and tap its reserves are fading. fading.",

British officials say they will resist any attempts to unpick the text or to shift the charter to anything more binding. France and Germany have been pressing for the charter to be incorporated into the Nice treaty. The draft won immediate endorsement from the CBI, which had opposed earlier versions on the grounds it would impose new costs on business and undermine Britain's competitive advantages. \"Nobody should pretend that this draft is perfect, but the government has fought hard for business and come up with a result we can live with,\" said Susan Anderson, director of human resources. \"There will be no shift in the balance of power between the EU and member states.\" Giampiero Alhadeff, secretary general of Solidar, an umbrella group of unions, said: \"This is just the kind of Europe people want, a Europe of rights and responsibilities. We did not get all we wanted, but this is a great beginning.\" Francis Maude, the shadow foreign secretary, accused the prime minister of having sold out British interests. \"This job- destroying charter should have been vetoed at the outset, as Conservatives demanded. Everyone throughout the EU - except Labour - now admits that the charter is very likely to grow into a legally binding treaty. The charter's rights to strike threaten to roll back 20 years of Tory reforms.\" Rights charter \u0095Right to life \u0095Respect for private and family life \u0095Protection of personal data \u0095Right to education \u0095Freedom to conduct a business \u0095Equality between men and women \u0095Fair and just working conditions \u0095Right of collective bargaining and action \u0095Access to EU documents \u0095Rights of elderly to life of dignity",

The dream has soured.</p> <p>Reunification has placed a huge burden on the west Germany taxpayer. Officially the figure is just shy of DM500bn (\u00a3153bn) - other, unofficial estimates put it at double that amount. Even today the costs are blamed for hobbling the scope of tax reform.</p> <p>But for all the flow of cash from west to east, unemployment in the new l\u00e4nder remains much higher than in west Germany and wages lower - an economic underachievement which has certainly not hindered, and probably helped, the rise of the extreme right.</p> <p>Yet amid the prevailing euphoria of 1990, unification was meant to have been a breeze. East Germany's economy was the showcase of the old Soviet bloc. Its integration into the west German powerhouse could scarcely present an insurmountable challenge - could it? Germany's financial markets, in party mood over reunification, barely gave the issue a thought. Investors scrambled to climb aboard what promised to be a gravy train.</p> <p>A decade on and conventional wisdom has been stood on its head. Far from merging seemlessly with the west, eastern Germany has struggled as plants have closed or cut back and workers have been thrown out of jobs once thought secure.</p> <p>Unemployment in the new l\u00e4nder is just under 17% - significantly more than double the level in what was west Germany.

      "bodyText": "Today Germany celebrates the 10th anniversary of reunification. For some, however, \"celebrate\" might not be the right word. The dream has soured. Reunification has placed a huge burden on the west Germany taxpayer. Officially the figure is just shy of DM500bn (\u00a3153bn) - other, unofficial estimates put it at double that amount. Even today the costs are blamed for hobbling the scope of tax reform. But for all the flow of cash from west to east, unemployment in the new l\u00e4nder remains much higher than in west Germany and wages lower - an economic underachievement which has certainly not hindered, and probably helped, the rise of the extreme right. Yet amid the prevailing euphoria of 1990, unification was meant to have been a breeze. East Germany's economy was the showcase of the old Soviet bloc. Its integration into the west German powerhouse could scarcely present an insurmountable challenge - could it? Germany's financial markets, in party mood over reunification, barely gave the issue a thought. Investors scrambled to climb aboard what promised to be a gravy train. A decade on and conventional wisdom has been stood on its head. Far from merging seemlessly with the west, eastern Germany has struggled as plants have closed or cut back and workers have been thrown out of jobs once thought secure. Unemployment in the new l\u00e4nder is just under 17% - significantly more than double the level in what was west Germany. Real per capita gross domestic product - a measure of relative economic performance - has been stuck at less than 60% of that of west Germany for the last five years. Stock market analysts struggle to name an established east German enterprise which has made it to the Dax index - the equivalent of Britain's blue chip FTSE 100. But why did the showcase turn out to be a basket case? Two decisions taken amid the euphoria of unification have had a big impact on the east German economy. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's insistence -against the advice of the Bundesbank, the country's central bank - on a one-for-one exchange rate of the east German mark for the west German mark was a vote winner in the east, but made much of the industrial base of the new l\u00e4nder uncompetitive overnight. West German trade union determination that wage rates in the east should rise to within hailing distance of those in the west meant that efforts to address the competitiveness issue were stymied from the start. Though wage deals have moderated in the past five years, unit labour costs in the new l\u00e4nder are still 25% above those in west Germany. But as a Commerzbank economist, Ralph Solveen, points out, though the high level of wage settlements in the early years undermined east German competitiveness, a more commercial approach to wage levels would have had awkward consequences, too. \"Everyone who could have come from the east to the west would have done so. We would have had lots of highly skilled people in west Germany and no one in the east,\" he says. East German industrial firms also lagged far behind their western counterparts. Take for example the state-owned chemical plant at Schwarzheide, bought by BASF, one of west Germany's big three chemical companies, within a week of reunification.

Ask most of us for the title of a life-changing book and we are likely to pick a much-loved novel or even a collection of poems. It is not hard to see why. Great fiction always welcomes our return, there to find new meanings, explore old ambiguities.</p> <p>For Linda Grant, journalist, non-fiction writer and Orange Prize-winning novelist: \"It is the novels I go back to, particularly Fay Weldon's Down Among The Women and Doris Lessing's The Golden Notebook. I can think of non-fiction that was important to me but I wouldn't re-read it because one has absorbed the arguments and time has moved on.\"</p> <p>That was then, but what about now? Where is the literary writing, as opposed to the fiction-lite of a Helen Fielding or Amy Jenkins, that explores the deeper truths about domestic life, friendship, motherhood, political involvement? Maybe we don't write like that because we don't live like that?</p> <p>According to Anna Davis, one of the few women to feature in the recent much-vaunted New Puritan collection: \"The New Puritans have been criticised for being influenced by cinema and popular culture, but when I listen to people talking on the street, they are talking about EastEnders. In many ways, these are selfish times. This is an era of trivia.\"</p> <p>But we are undoubtedly the poorer for it. What was so important about some of the earlier women writers was that they granted their heroines a complex consciousness, a consciousness we take for granted in grown-up contemporary fiction by the likes of Philip Roth or Saul Bellow.</p> <p>Simone de Beauvoir's The Mandarins, published in 1954, is probably one of the most monumental novels to describe masochistic, dependent love, political commitment and deep sexual love in one tale. Doris Lessing's The Golden Notebook, published in 1962, both charted the illusions and despair of a political generation and showed, literally, how women break down.</p> <p>At the same time, writers such as Lessing, Margaret Drabble and Fay Weldon brought a ruthless honesty to their descriptions of motherhood. The feminist movement threw up its own explicit, polemical fiction. \"This book changes lives\" proclaims my copy of Marilyn French's The Women's Room. While there was undoubtedly mediocre work produced under the feminist flag, the best of it was serious women writing about serious stuff. It allowed a kind of multi-layered subjectivity that seems to have been ironed away by the relentless cigs, calories and condoms mentality.</p> <p>Of course there are good women writers, young and old. Zadie Smith, Linda Grant, Maggie Gee, Hilary Mantel, Pat Barker. Lessing, Drabble and Weldon are all still publishing. But as the critic James Wood recently wrote, the fiction that dominates our consciousness and the market is penned largely by men and refuses \"to take much note of place, history or society\". Some of British fiction's most eminent women, such as Jeanette Winterson, avoid engagement with what we might call ordinary, rooted experience. AL Kennedy's last book was about bullfighting.</p> <p>Enter Helen Simpson, the brilliant short story writer chosen as one of Granta's Best of Young British novelists and former Sunday Times Young Writer of the Year. Simpson's first two collections were wondrous wisps of satire, surreal snippets of modern sexual manners. But in her new collection, Hey Yeah Right Get A Life, she offers us something both subtly and significantly altered: a searing portrayal of modern womanhood that feels like some kind of restoral. In her slim, satirical, angry tales, we meet Jade the teenager repulsed by the \"ragged cuticles ... heels stuck out from the backs of her sandals like hunks of Parmesan\" of a mother she meets on the street struggling to get a lentil out of her child's nose. Then there is Dorrie, the stay-at-home mother who patiently endures the \"seamless cycle of nourishment and devoural\" that is family life, allowing herself snatched moments of solitude and a dream of a different future.</p> <p>In some ways, it seems odd to argue that Simpson is the modern inheritor of an earlier tradition of truth-telling about women's lives. There is nothing polemical in her stories. They have a comic lightness born of rigorous craft. To an undiscerning reader, her heroines, most more or less desperate mothers, could be Bridget Jones postpartum. But in the current bland climate, her stories seem almost revolutionary. I doubt a less admired writer would have been published on such an unpromising subject as women at home, women in despair.</p> <p>Simpson recognises that she has written something oddly new yet old. \"The way people have been talking about it, before it's even published, I can see there will be some ... hostility.\" She hesitates. \"Someone came up to me yesterday and said: 'You've written a political book.' I feel I've breached some kind of taboo.\" Which is odd, again, given the near saturation of our culture with ersatz tales of contemporary motherhood.</p> <p>But if she is updating domestic fiction, in the best truthful tradition, Simpson's heroines never make it past the front door. In that sense, her work reflects the personal and political quiescence of our time. We still lack a literature that describes women in a wider context, women as citizens in the wider community, nation or globe, the kind of complex fiction that characterises the work of the Nobel Laureate Nadine Gordimer.</p> <p>According to Maggie Gee, author of The Burning Book, one of the most brilliant personal/political novels of the 80s: \"There are people, men and women, writing about wider society. But so many things, such as the market, the critical consensus or the slant towards historical fiction, stop us seeing it. A good writer like Pat Barker, who had written novels about contemporary Britain, began to get more serious attention when she wrote about reputable literary men in the first world war.\" Gee believes: \"If you are interested in language and structure, write about contemporary society and are political, it somehow doesn't fit into the critical grid.\"</p> <p>We can but hope. Anna Davis sees positive changes in both public life and publishing. \"The protests against the World Bank suggest that something is changing. There's a new politics, a new generation out there. People in publishing are getting fed up of the Bridget Jones thing and talking about wanting to publish writing that has a wider sweep.

      "body": "<p>In the next couple of weeks record numbers of bright-eyed, bushy-tailed American students will arrive in Britain to study at our universities and colleges as the long-standing \"special relationship\" between the two countries shows no sign of cooling. </p> <p>American universities understandably have a newfound appeal because of concerns here about the prospect of spiralling tuition fees and the case of comprehensive schoolgirl Laura Spence, who was accepted by Harvard after being rejected by Oxford. But at the same time the UK continues to hold its appeal for American students as the most popular country for study abroad. </p> <p>The most recent figures, published by the Institute of International Education in New York in its OpenDoors Report on international educational exchange, show that the UK attracted 25,900 students in 1997/98. This is a 14.6% increase on the previous year and puts it 15,000 ahead of its closest rival, Spain. </p> <p>Bill Clinton's daughter Chelsea recently revealed her wish to follow in the footsteps of her famous father - himself a Rhodes scholar - and take up a place at Oxford. </p> <p>Although these figures are for the number of US students receiving formal academic credit for study abroad, time spent in the UK can be a matter of weeks, as a visiting student, through to three years for undergraduate study, with further study beyond that. Many students opt to take their \"freshman\" year at a British university, before returning home to continue their study at an American university. Increasingly, compatibility of courses means that students can now get credited for most - if not all - of their coursework in the UK. </p> <p>If Americans enjoy the social life in Britain it is not surprising. Over here, US students can drink alcohol legally, whereas at home they have to wait until 21. But jokes about booze apart, there are worries on both sides of the Atlantic about whether the thousands of US students descending on British libraries and common rooms are engaged in legitimate study, or simply taking a glorified vacation. </p> <p>The president of New York University raised these very concerns at the official opening of NYU's latest venture, its \"NYU in London center\". Dr L Jay Oliva, who studied in Europe as a Fribourg Fellow, warned: \"The problem with the structure of the 'standard version' of the study abroad programme for US undergraduates is that it has been more like a vacation than a year spent working towards a degree. It has the elements of the Grand Tour: a little study, a little language acquisition, a few museum visits, and a lot of hours at local cafes. It is more 'international education' in theory than in practice.\" </p> <p>On a more positive note, he said he foresees a future \"in which no university education is seen as complete unless it involves a real and substantial international component\". </p> <p>NYU has decided to build on its links with two colleges at London University - the London School of Economics and University College London - by investing hundreds of thousands of pounds in a permanent base at the heart of the university in Bloomsbury. The new foreign study centre will be the first in the world to offer ongoing science work for American undergraduates doing a pre-medical curriculum. The London coursework will give US credits, while NYU is expected to offer courses to British undergraduates. </p> <p>NYU already has similar centres in Paris, Florence, Madrid, Prague and - next on the list - Tel Aviv, as well as collaborations and exchange programmes with universities and higher education colleges in nearly 30 cities around the world. David-Hillel Ruben, director of the programme in London, explained: \"We wanted to produce the most credible academic programme that will be highly regarded in both countries. In particular, we want to avoid students being ghettoised by being taught together, by American staff. We believe we will have a truly reciprocal arrangement which will benefit everyone.\" </p> <p>London and Oxford and Cambridge remain the most popular cities because of the combination of their academic reputations and cultural attractions. But famous cities such as York, Bristol and Bath also have big pulling power, and easier air travel has made Scotland more viable. At St Andrew's the joke is that there are more Americans than Scots. That is flatly denied by the university, which says only 8.84% of its students are from the US. Overseas students make up only 12% of its student population. </p> <p>At the top of the academic league, the long-established Rhodes programme for Oxford and the Fulbright Commission have offered American students the chance to study in Britain. Also recently confirmed is Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates' scholarship scheme for Cambridge University, which will open more places. </p> <p>This year's 25 Fulbright scholars flew into Britain from the US for induction before dispersing to their respective corners of the country. Refreshingly, only four are bound for Oxbridge, although a large number are heading for London. </p> <p>Rachel Stanley, a 21-year-old chemistry graduate from MIT, went straight to Southampton Oceanography centre, where her nine-month research programme will centre around measuring ocean currents. Fellow Fulbrighter 24-year-old Daniel Margolis, who is taking an MSc in local economic development at LSE, added: \"I grew up in LA and went to university there. I wanted a different perspective on life from a different country. London is a cultural mecca - I intend to make the most of it.\" </p> <p>James Moore, director of the Fulbright Commission, welcomed the NYU initiative - particularly if it puts an end to ghettoisation. \"Anything that will bring more young Americans over here is to be welcomed. We want to show them that there is more to this country than men in tweeds and women in Laura Ashley. As Senator Fulbright said: 'It is when you leave your country that you really learn about it'.\"</p>",

But at the same time the UK continues to hold its appeal for American students as the most popular country for study abroad. The most recent figures, published by the Institute of International Education in New York in its OpenDoors Report on international educational exchange, show that the UK attracted 25,900 students in 1997/98. This is a 14.6% increase on the previous year and puts it 15,000 ahead of its closest rival, Spain. Bill Clinton's daughter Chelsea recently revealed her wish to follow in the footsteps of her famous father - himself a Rhodes scholar - and take up a place at Oxford. Although these figures are for the number of US students receiving formal academic credit for study abroad, time spent in the UK can be a matter of weeks, as a visiting student, through to three years for undergraduate study, with further study beyond that. Many students opt to take their \"freshman\" year at a British university, before returning home to continue their study at an American university. Increasingly, compatibility of courses means that students can now get credited for most - if not all - of their coursework in the UK. If Americans enjoy the social life in Britain it is not surprising. Over here, US students can drink alcohol legally, whereas at home they have to wait until 21. But jokes about booze apart, there are worries on both sides of the Atlantic about whether the thousands of US students descending on British libraries and common rooms are engaged in legitimate study, or simply taking a glorified vacation. The president of New York University raised these very concerns at the official opening of NYU's latest venture, its \"NYU in London center\". Dr L Jay Oliva, who studied in Europe as a Fribourg Fellow, warned: \"The problem with the structure of the 'standard version' of the study abroad programme for US undergraduates is that it has been more like a vacation than a year spent working towards a degree. It has the elements of the Grand Tour: a little study, a little language acquisition, a few museum visits, and a lot of hours at local cafes. It is more 'international education' in theory than in practice.\" On a more positive note, he said he foresees a future \"in which no university education is seen as complete unless it involves a real and substantial international component\". NYU has decided to build on its links with two colleges at London University - the London School of Economics and University College London - by investing hundreds of thousands of pounds in a permanent base at the heart of the university in Bloomsbury. The new foreign study centre will be the first in the world to offer ongoing science work for American undergraduates doing a pre-medical curriculum. The London coursework will give US credits, while NYU is expected to offer courses to British undergraduates. NYU already has similar centres in Paris, Florence, Madrid, Prague and - next on the list - Tel Aviv, as well as collaborations and exchange programmes with universities and higher education colleges in nearly 30 cities around the world. David-Hillel Ruben, director of the programme in London, explained: \"We wanted to produce the most credible academic programme that will be highly regarded in both countries. In particular, we want to avoid students being ghettoised by being taught together, by American staff. We believe we will have a truly reciprocal arrangement which will benefit everyone.\" London and Oxford and Cambridge remain the most popular cities because of the combination of their academic reputations and cultural attractions. But famous cities such as York, Bristol and Bath also have big pulling power, and easier air travel has made Scotland more viable. At St Andrew's the joke is that there are more Americans than Scots. That is flatly denied by the university, which says only 8.84% of its students are from the US. Overseas students make up only 12% of its student population. At the top of the academic league, the long-established Rhodes programme for Oxford and the Fulbright Commission have offered American students the chance to study in Britain. Also recently confirmed is Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates' scholarship scheme for Cambridge University, which will open more places. This year's 25 Fulbright scholars flew into Britain from the US for induction before dispersing to their respective corners of the country. Refreshingly, only four are bound for Oxbridge, although a large number are heading for London. Rachel Stanley, a 21-year-old chemistry graduate from MIT, went straight to Southampton Oceanography centre, where her nine-month research programme will centre around measuring ocean currents. Fellow Fulbrighter 24-year-old Daniel Margolis, who is taking an MSc in local economic development at LSE, added: \"I grew up in LA and went to university there. I wanted a different perspective on life from a different country. London is a cultural mecca - I intend to make the most of it.\" James Moore, director of the Fulbright Commission, welcomed the NYU initiative - particularly if it puts an end to ghettoisation. \"Anything that will bring more young Americans over here is to be welcomed. We want to show them that there is more to this country than men in tweeds and women in Laura Ashley. As Senator Fulbright said: 'It is when you leave your country that you really learn about it'.\"",

(crash) <br></p> <p><strong> It just sort of slipped.</strong> You clumsy idiot! <br></p> <p><strong> Please tell me it's insured!</strong> It isn't. <br></p> <p><strong> What? Why on earth not?</strong> That's my tea-break mug you've smashed. <br></p> <p><strong> Thank God for that.</strong> It's my favourite mug. <br></p> <p><strong> I'm sure you curators are well paid. </strong> You're joking. <br></p> <p><strong> Actually, I'm thinking about becoming a curator myself.</strong> Oh well, there are over 3,000 museums in the UK employing 13,000 curators. <br></p> <p><strong> Meaning?</strong> You won't have to apply here. <br></p> <p><strong> I get the message. Look, here's 50p for the mug </strong> - Thank you - <strong> if you tell me a bit about the job.</strong> Very well. Curators manage collections of objects of archaeological, scientific, historical and general interest. In large museums they are likely to specialise, but in small general collections that's generally not the case. <br></p> <p><strong> Any other differences?</strong> In large national museums curators either manage collections or administrate, ie boss other staff, go to meetings, fundraise and so on. In a smaller museum these duties are combined. <br></p> <p><strong> What larks! Tell me more.</strong> Curators identify objects. <br></p> <p><strong> Oops. Like your mug.</strong> Precisely. They record details, and organise restoration, care and cleaning. They plan exhibitions and displays, which involves labelling and displaying exhibits, writing catalogues and organising publicity. They may be called upon to give talks to visitors, including school parties. They're also asked to identify and examine items brought into the museum. <br></p> <p><strong> What skills are you looking for?</strong> Curators need to be versatile. Obviously they need expertise in the subjects that they deal with. Imagination and creative flair are important for attracting the public. Good writing and communication skills are also desirable for this and for accurately recording information and giving lectures. <br></p> <p><strong> What about qualifications?</strong> Over 85% of curators have degrees and higher degrees. Some local authorities require a postgraduate qualification in museum studies whereas large or specialist museums may employ someone on the basis of a good school record. <br></p> <p><strong> What degrees are preferred?</strong> Some first-degree courses include museum and heritage management, for example, heritage conservation or museum and heritage studies. Otherwise, relevant subjects might be history, biology, botany, fine art, anthropology, engineering, chemistry, ceramics, textiles - anything related to a specific collection. <br></p> <p><strong> Any age limit?</strong> You're lucky. There's no upper age limit as long as you have the relevant qualifications. <br></p> <p><strong> Cheeky! Any other tips?</strong> It's a good idea to have done some voluntary work in a museum. <br></p> <p><strong> What about training and promotion?</strong> Training is usually on the job.

      "bodyText": "W hat lovely porcelain. Oi! It's Limoges, isn't it? Put that down at once! (crash) It just sort of slipped. You clumsy idiot! Please tell me it's insured! It isn't. What? Why on earth not? That's my tea-break mug you've smashed. Thank God for that. It's my favourite mug. I'm sure you curators are well paid. You're joking. Actually, I'm thinking about becoming a curator myself. Oh well, there are over 3,000 museums in the UK employing 13,000 curators. Meaning? You won't have to apply here. I get the message. Look, here's 50p for the mug - Thank you - if you tell me a bit about the job. Very well. Curators manage collections of objects of archaeological, scientific, historical and general interest. In large museums they are likely to specialise, but in small general collections that's generally not the case. Any other differences? In large national museums curators either manage collections or administrate, ie boss other staff, go to meetings, fundraise and so on. In a smaller museum these duties are combined. What larks! Tell me more. Curators identify objects. Oops. Like your mug. Precisely. They record details, and organise restoration, care and cleaning. They plan exhibitions and displays, which involves labelling and displaying exhibits, writing catalogues and organising publicity. They may be called upon to give talks to visitors, including school parties. They're also asked to identify and examine items brought into the museum. What skills are you looking for? Curators need to be versatile. Obviously they need expertise in the subjects that they deal with. Imagination and creative flair are important for attracting the public. Good writing and communication skills are also desirable for this and for accurately recording information and giving lectures. What about qualifications? Over 85% of curators have degrees and higher degrees. Some local authorities require a postgraduate qualification in museum studies whereas large or specialist museums may employ someone on the basis of a good school record. What degrees are preferred? Some first-degree courses include museum and heritage management, for example, heritage conservation or museum and heritage studies. Otherwise, relevant subjects might be history, biology, botany, fine art, anthropology, engineering, chemistry, ceramics, textiles - anything related to a specific collection. Any age limit? You're lucky. There's no upper age limit as long as you have the relevant qualifications. Cheeky! Any other tips? It's a good idea to have done some voluntary work in a museum. What about training and promotion? Training is usually on the job. Most entrants start as assistant curators. In national museums, the career path is from assistant curator to curator, then department head and director. Promotion often depends on the size of the museum. Many are too small for a promotion structure. Related occupations include conservator, restorer, archivist and archaeologist. \u0095 Association of Independent Museums Telephone 020-7379 6344 www.aimus.org.uk \u0095 The Museums Association Telephone 020-7608 2933 \u0095 Scottish Society for Conservation and Restoration Telephone 01506 811 777 \u0095 learndirect 0800 100900 may be able to give further information and advice on courses.",

And by and large they do just that. Which presents problems of its own. It's all very well getting a place at art school, but what do you do if you don't want to leave?",

Although only 7% attend church on an average Sunday, 33% of schools are church schools. It is surely scandalous that religious schools - despite being funded by all taxpayers - can reject pupils because their parents are not deemed sufficiently pious, or of the appropriate denomination. Although they can turn our children away, we can't opt out of paying for them. </p> <p>Parents want the best education for their children, and if this needs some gross hypocrisy by going to church regularly to gain a church school place, then that's what you will have to do, like thousands of other non-believers. </p> <p>Not all denominational schools are felt to be good, of course, but many are. Their success is generally due to better funding and an ability to cream off the best pupils. The more they do this, the more other schools suffer. </p> <p>Nor are denominational schools helpful in working towards an integrated multicultural society, free from sectarianism. You might think the awful lessons from Northern Ireland would encourage the government to reduce the number of denominational schools. On the contrary, it is actively encouraging more church schools. </p> <p>The National Secular Society wants high-quality, non-religious schools to be available to all, regardless of belief. You may wish to join our campaign at: <a href=\"http://www.secularism.org.uk\">www.secularism.org.uk</a> </p> <p>If you send your son to a church school, encourage him to be tolerant of others' beliefs but, above all, to question what he is taught and to value truth and integrity above all else. </p> <p><strong> Monsignor Richard Moth Communications Officer, Archdiocese of Southwark, says:</strong><br> </p> <p>Many Catholic schools are over-subscribed to by practising Catholics, so few places are left for non-practising pupils. All schools have their own admissions policy drawn up by the governors, but they normally offer places first to children who have been baptised as Catholics and regularly attend mass. The next group are those who have been baptised but who do not necessarily attend church every week. Other places are offered first to children who are baptised and practising in another denomination, and only then to other applicants. </p> <p>In some areas Catholic schools cannot even take all the Catholic pupils. Where there are fewer Catholic families, the number of non-practising pupils is greater. It really depends on the admissions policy and location of a school. </p> <p>There would be no question of going to church a few times and hoping to get a place at a Catholic school. References are sought from parish priests, and baptism certificates have to be produced. With children from other denominations we would expect to see, for example, a baptism certificate from the Church of England. </p> <p><strong> John Hall, general secretary of the Church of England's Board of Education and National Society, Church House, says:</strong> <br></p> <p>C of E schools were never meant to be exclusive but for all 17,000 schools were founded by the National Society (the Church's educational arm) in the first half of the 19th century. Currently, there are high proportions of C of E primary schools in rural and inner-city areas - up to 75% in some areas) but fewer in the suburbs (often 1:8) and far too few secondary schools (nationally 1:20). </p> <p>The Church wants to increase the number of schools in response to demand. Lord Dearing is chairing a review of Church schools and has called for 100 more C of E secondaries within the next five years. Popular schools doing well are not allowed to expand at the expense of others. So where there is high demand, C of E schools have to turn pupils away. The governing body frames an admissions policy in consultation with the diocesan and local education authorities. </p> <p>Many C of E schools admit pupils from a wide area, giving preference to practising Anglicans. Others admit local children as a priority. They want to be places of encounter between Christians and those of other faiths and none, places that are generous and open but of clear conviction. </p> <p>They explore the tremendous and fascinating mystery at the heart of all things, who is called God. That gives them their integrity. </p> <p><strong> Next week's problem:</strong> My teenage son only reads the odd football magazine. He used to be such a voracious reader, but now has no interest in reading. I'm concerned that this will hold him back in the future. Are my fears justified? What can I do to persuade him to read more?</p>",

The more they do this, the more other schools suffer. Nor are denominational schools helpful in working towards an integrated multicultural society, free from sectarianism. You might think the awful lessons from Northern Ireland would encourage the government to reduce the number of denominational schools. On the contrary, it is actively encouraging more church schools. The National Secular Society wants high-quality, non-religious schools to be available to all, regardless of belief. You may wish to join our campaign at: www.secularism.org.uk If you send your son to a church school, encourage him to be tolerant of others' beliefs but, above all, to question what he is taught and to value truth and integrity above all else. Monsignor Richard Moth Communications Officer, Archdiocese of Southwark, says: Many Catholic schools are over-subscribed to by practising Catholics, so few places are left for non-practising pupils. All schools have their own admissions policy drawn up by the governors, but they normally offer places first to children who have been baptised as Catholics and regularly attend mass. The next group are those who have been baptised but who do not necessarily attend church every week. Other places are offered first to children who are baptised and practising in another denomination, and only then to other applicants. In some areas Catholic schools cannot even take all the Catholic pupils. Where there are fewer Catholic families, the number of non-practising pupils is greater. It really depends on the admissions policy and location of a school. There would be no question of going to church a few times and hoping to get a place at a Catholic school. References are sought from parish priests, and baptism certificates have to be produced. With children from other denominations we would expect to see, for example, a baptism certificate from the Church of England. John Hall, general secretary of the Church of England's Board of Education and National Society, Church House, says: C of E schools were never meant to be exclusive but for all 17,000 schools were founded by the National Society (the Church's educational arm) in the first half of the 19th century. Currently, there are high proportions of C of E primary schools in rural and inner-city areas - up to 75% in some areas) but fewer in the suburbs (often 1:8) and far too few secondary schools (nationally 1:20). The Church wants to increase the number of schools in response to demand. Lord Dearing is chairing a review of Church schools and has called for 100 more C of E secondaries within the next five years. Popular schools doing well are not allowed to expand at the expense of others. So where there is high demand, C of E schools have to turn pupils away. The governing body frames an admissions policy in consultation with the diocesan and local education authorities. Many C of E schools admit pupils from a wide area, giving preference to practising Anglicans. Others admit local children as a priority. They want to be places of encounter between Christians and those of other faiths and none, places that are generous and open but of clear conviction. They explore the tremendous and fascinating mystery at the heart of all things, who is called God. That gives them their integrity. Next week's problem: My teenage son only reads the odd football magazine. He used to be such a voracious reader, but now has no interest in reading. I'm concerned that this will hold him back in the future. Are my fears justified? What can I do to persuade him to read more?",

      "body": "<p>When I was a little girl, my mum took me to the library each week. It did not occur to me then that I wasn't supposed to love reading. The librarian, regularly and in a terrifying manner, used to say: \"You're going to grow up to be a right little bookworm, if you're not careful!\" </p> <p>I did, too. But I grew up in an exclusively working-class area, where it wasn't acceptable to be bookish. Only one person I knew - a boy - went on to university. Teenagers know that every song of angst and yearning is about them; I was also convinced that Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure, about a working-class character with a thwarted passion for learning, was my story. </p> <p>Frustrated, I dropped out - although what exactly I was dropping out from is a good question. What I dropped into is easier to answer: sex and drugs and rock'n'roll, a failed marriage, dodgy associates, violence, a mental breakdown. But something positive did come out of that time - by chance, I stumbled into the Open University. Of course, I was a weirdo for writing essays when I didn't have to, but I was in my twenties by then, and reputation no longer concerned me. When I had my breakdown I couldn't do ordinary things, but I kept on studying. In a senseless world, filled with the dangers of preparing a bowl of cornflakes, books were the only things that made sense. Then my OU tutor suggested I should be in education full-time. I could see that was something worth getting better for, and began to research it. </p> <p>Lucy Cavendish is a university college unique in Europe for taking only female mature students. That sounded great. Yet it is part of the University of Cambridge - I mean, me, an ex-barmaid, go to Cambridge? Do me a favour. But if you forget the hype it becomes clear that Cambridge can accommodate many kinds of student, with its collegiate system, one-to-one supervisions and student-led reading choices. Even the criteria for getting in suited me: mature students there still take an entrance exam, and must show evidence of recent study to a high standard, but not necessarily three A levels. </p> <p>So I put my health back together. I had to. I wanted this. And in 1992, when I was nearly 27, I went up to Cambridge to read English. </p> <p>It changed my life. Radically. I can't pretend that there aren't some attendant costs: educating yourself out of your own class, but doing so at an age where assimilating into the educated class is not realistic, not even entirely desirable, means that you become, for ever, neither flesh nor fowl nor good red herring. But that disadvantage can be made to work for you. My first novel, Three Blind Mice, comes out in April (Little,Brown/Abacus), and relies on my privileged access to a wide variety of class accents, attitudes, ways of life. Novelists should fit in everywhere and nowhere. </p> <p> Lucy Cavendish College should perhaps, then, produce more novelists than it does, for it is full of women from every social class who find themselves in a position far different from their original expectations. </p> <p>And it is the one place where not fitting in becomes the touchstone for belonging.

      "bodyText": "When I was a little girl, my mum took me to the library each week. It did not occur to me then that I wasn't supposed to love reading. The librarian, regularly and in a terrifying manner, used to say: \"You're going to grow up to be a right little bookworm, if you're not careful!\" I did, too. But I grew up in an exclusively working-class area, where it wasn't acceptable to be bookish. Only one person I knew - a boy - went on to university. Teenagers know that every song of angst and yearning is about them; I was also convinced that Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure, about a working-class character with a thwarted passion for learning, was my story. Frustrated, I dropped out - although what exactly I was dropping out from is a good question. What I dropped into is easier to answer: sex and drugs and rock'n'roll, a failed marriage, dodgy associates, violence, a mental breakdown. But something positive did come out of that time - by chance, I stumbled into the Open University. Of course, I was a weirdo for writing essays when I didn't have to, but I was in my twenties by then, and reputation no longer concerned me. When I had my breakdown I couldn't do ordinary things, but I kept on studying. In a senseless world, filled with the dangers of preparing a bowl of cornflakes, books were the only things that made sense. Then my OU tutor suggested I should be in education full-time. I could see that was something worth getting better for, and began to research it. Lucy Cavendish is a university college unique in Europe for taking only female mature students. That sounded great. Yet it is part of the University of Cambridge - I mean, me, an ex-barmaid, go to Cambridge? Do me a favour. But if you forget the hype it becomes clear that Cambridge can accommodate many kinds of student, with its collegiate system, one-to-one supervisions and student-led reading choices. Even the criteria for getting in suited me: mature students there still take an entrance exam, and must show evidence of recent study to a high standard, but not necessarily three A levels. So I put my health back together. I had to. I wanted this. And in 1992, when I was nearly 27, I went up to Cambridge to read English. It changed my life. Radically. I can't pretend that there aren't some attendant costs: educating yourself out of your own class, but doing so at an age where assimilating into the educated class is not realistic, not even entirely desirable, means that you become, for ever, neither flesh nor fowl nor good red herring. But that disadvantage can be made to work for you. My first novel, Three Blind Mice, comes out in April (Little,Brown/Abacus), and relies on my privileged access to a wide variety of class accents, attitudes, ways of life. Novelists should fit in everywhere and nowhere. Lucy Cavendish College should perhaps, then, produce more novelists than it does, for it is full of women from every social class who find themselves in a position far different from their original expectations. And it is the one place where not fitting in becomes the touchstone for belonging. The friends I made at Lucy Cavendish will be in my life always. My contemporaries include a journalist (ex-housewife), a medical negligence solicitor (ex-nurse), a doctor (ex-rock musician), an academic researcher (ex-care assistant). I'm not saying it's been easy for any of us, that there aren't less encouraging stories of marriages breaking down under the pressure, of debts building up - but of my own crowd, only one person is not more fulfilled than before. I stayed on to do graduate work, and now teach for Lucy Cavendish and for several other Cambridge colleges, including the more famous ones. But I always give preference to Lucy, turning down other work if I think it will interfere with my commitment there. I generally prefer teaching mature students - they often bring a real passion to their work, rarely taking the opportunity for granted. And after all, I owe my own college my loyalty, as it gave me my chance. For me it wasn't a second chance. It was my chance, for which I'm inexpressibly grateful. Not all mature students will have their lives so transformed, but no life can be quite the same after an education. At the least, it will contain a far higher level of choice. Parity of secondary education and a change in social attitudes would mean that fewer people who would benefit from higher education would have to do without one. The biggest barrier is that too many people don't realise that the possibility is open to them. We who have discovered that it is have a responsibility to shout about it. An ex-public schoolboy said to me: \"When I came up to Cambridge, I never expected to be taught by someone who wears five-inch heels, has tattoos, and speaks like an Essex girl.\" She never expected to be teaching him, either. For some mature students, other universities, perhaps those in their home towns or those offering distance or part-time courses, would be more suitable, but this is my story and I went to Cambridge.

This is in the playground at three minutes past nine, as kids file into classrooms and parents dash off to work, hang around the school gates to chat, or collar their son's or daughter's teacher for some vital purpose. </p> <p>\"Sure.\" </p> <p>Susie is Jack's mum. Jack is in the same class, year two, as our Lucy. </p> <p>Susie is simultaneously chaotic and glamorous. From a long line of bohemians, she stands out from the crowd at our south London state primary which, despite a demographic mix drawn straight from the ethnic diversity handbook, has an ethos that is overwhelmingly respectable-white-working-class. </p> <p>Susie doesn't look as if she has a minute herself; but then she never does. This must be something important. </p> <p>\"It's about the governor's election.\" </p> <p>\"Oh yes, I saw something about a vacancy.\" </p> <p>It had been mentioned in one of the snowstorm of photocopied sheets that come back in Lucy's backpack every day at the beginning of a new term. This flier noted that, owing to so-and-so's departure, there was a vacancy for a parent-governor on the board. </p> <p>Governor. I had thought about it for a second, because I know it's the sort of thing that well-intentioned middle-class parents do when they care about their children's schooling. And the word has a good ring about it - sort of official and important, but selfless and public-spirited, like being a lay magistrate but without sending anyone to prison.

      "bodyText": "\"Do you have a minute?\" says Susie breathlessly. This is in the playground at three minutes past nine, as kids file into classrooms and parents dash off to work, hang around the school gates to chat, or collar their son's or daughter's teacher for some vital purpose. \"Sure.\" Susie is Jack's mum. Jack is in the same class, year two, as our Lucy. Susie is simultaneously chaotic and glamorous. From a long line of bohemians, she stands out from the crowd at our south London state primary which, despite a demographic mix drawn straight from the ethnic diversity handbook, has an ethos that is overwhelmingly respectable-white-working-class. Susie doesn't look as if she has a minute herself; but then she never does. This must be something important. \"It's about the governor's election.\" \"Oh yes, I saw something about a vacancy.\" It had been mentioned in one of the snowstorm of photocopied sheets that come back in Lucy's backpack every day at the beginning of a new term. This flier noted that, owing to so-and-so's departure, there was a vacancy for a parent-governor on the board. Governor. I had thought about it for a second, because I know it's the sort of thing that well-intentioned middle-class parents do when they care about their children's schooling. And the word has a good ring about it - sort of official and important, but selfless and public-spirited, like being a lay magistrate but without sending anyone to prison. But I wasn't sure what governors actually do. But then, as soon as I thought of it, I dismissed the idea: I'm too busy; maybe in a couple of years when Lucy's further up the school, I thought.

She's also given them details of the poisonous things people said when they made anonymous telephone calls to her, and the vicious emails sent under false names. </p> <p>The letter gloating over the fact that her husband has recently been made redundant did not bother her. Nor did she care about the letter telling her to \"go and live in Russia,\" nor the anonymous correspondents who sent cuttings from the rightwing newspapers that have attacked her over the past year. </p> <p>But she was disturbed by the note she found on her car windscreen. It read: \"Don't be a porn (sic) of the Holy Trinity mafia.\" Debbie attends Holy Trinity church, whose vicar enthusiastically supported her campaign to end the 11-plus in Ripon. She doesn't much like the nasty, sneering telephone calls gloating about her failure to end it. And she worries about the email hate campaign, especially since the last email was traced to the computer of a prominent supporter of the 11-plus in Ripon (who denies having anything to do with it.) </p> <p>Debbie has brought all this on herself because she's a mother who believes passionately that the system of sending a quarter of Ripon's 11-year-olds to the grammar school, and the other three-quarters to the secondary moderns (which they euphemistically call high schools) is cruel and educationally wrong. She thought a Labour government would end the system. Instead, the government provided for ballots of parents in the areas that still have selective education. </p> <p>She decided to take up the challenge, and hers became one of Britain's three local parent-led campaigns to end the 11-plus (the others were in Kent and Trafford). None of them succeeded, and last week it was confirmed that none of them would be revived this year. The dice are simply loaded too heavily against them. </p> <p>At first, Debbie and the others were optimistic - until they saw the rules under which the ballot was to be conducted. The rules, and even the electoral roll, had been carefully doctored to deny her victory. Lord Hattersley told a Labour Party fringe meeting last week: \"Compared to these ballot procedures laid down by the government, this week's election in Serbia is a model of democracy.\" </p> <p>The three parents' groups tried to negotiate the complicated procedure, full of legal traps that were exploited by the litigious grammar school lobby, and regularly pilloried by rightwing newspapers. While they watched, the mountain they had to climb got bigger as the education department interpreted its rules in what seemed to be a thoroughly one-sided way. </p> <p>The rules first required them to get a petition to trigger a ballot, signed by 20% of eligible parents. First, they had to identify who were \"eligible parents\". The definition varied according to what proportion of the 11-year-olds in your area attended the grammar school. In Ripon, eligible parents meant parents of children who attended primary schools that sent a certain proportion of their pupils into the grammar school. The effect was that, if your children attended one of several local primary schools, you did not get a vote; but if they attended one of several private, fee-charging schools in the surrounding countryside, you did. </p> <p>\"We knew we had lost the ballot the day we realised that 26% of the electorate had their children at private schools, and that the school with the biggest number of eligible parents was a fee-charging school 12 miles outside Ripon,\" says Debbie Atkins. </p> <p>In Trafford, a larger proportion of children attended the grammar school, so different rules applied, and campaign organiser Malcolm Clarke faced a set of bureaucratic hurdles. Here's just one. </p> <p>Many Trafford parents send their children outside Trafford in order to escape the 11-plus, and would be sympathetic to abolishing it. But they, unlike parents of children at Trafford schools, were not automatically registered. The rules required Malcolm Clarke to persuade hundreds of parents, whom he did not know, whose names and addresses he was not permitted to have, to write to a balloting company in London, enclosing a birth certificate and a utilities bill and details of their children, in order that they might validly sign his petition triggering a ballot. He and his fellow campaigners were reduced to hanging around school bus stops in the early mornings. </p> <p>Ministers made one exception to this rule. A few carefully selected Trafford children go a private, fee-paying Catholic school called St Bede's, some miles away from Trafford, at the council's expense. Schools Minister Estelle Morris decreed that St Bede's parents would be automatically registered. </p> <p>But it is not simply hurdles like these that have led to the campaigners' decision not to try again this year. \"We spent \u00a32,000 on the campaign. We do not have the money to try to do it again. There's a price tag on this sort of democracy.\" </p> <p>In Kent, the 20% threshold meant getting 46,000 signatures. Kent campaign organiser Becky Matthews says that \"46,000 signatures wasn't achievable. On another issue, the local authority sent out a glossy document, and used schools to get it to parents - which we were not allowed to do. It got just 107 back.\" </p> <p>Her first problem was finding the parents. The rules said that schools could only give her a list of eligible parents if a parent at the school asked for it. Identifying a parent at each school who would ask for the list was a major obstacle, because in Kent, primary school heads have a say in whether your child passes the 11-plus and goes to a grammar school, or fails it and goes to a secondary modern (sorry, high school). \"Many parents were scared that if they asked for a list, the head might take a view of them and not recommend their child for grammar school,\" says Becky Matthews. </p> <p>Like Debbie Atkins and Malcolm Clarke, Becky Matthews did put her head above the parapet. Like them, she won't be doing it next year, but her campaign goes on, and one year soon she will be back with another petition, even if the government still refuses to provide a level playing field. </p> <p>All three pin the blame squarely on the Education Secretary, David Blunkett. Though he says he opposes selection, he created a system that was bound to preserve it, in order to protect himself from attacks by Conservatives and newspapers. Like a first world war general, he put the mothers and fathers of Kent, Trafford and Ripon in the front line, they say. </p> <p>Blunkett himself says he didn't want to be \"blown off course\" by the issue of selection. Perhaps that's another way of saying the same thing.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It has become standard practice for schools to profess opposition to prejudice. In the inner cities, posters advertise contempt for racism, sexism, maybe homophobia, too, if the headteacher is exceptionally brave. Even in the shires and small towns, where cultures may be more uniform, we find grave pledges of commitment to equal opportunities and fair play. If there is one place in children's lives where bigotry is challenged it is surely their schools. But could it be that appearances deceive? That the true impact of modern school life on the young is to narrow minds rather than expand them, to consolidate dislike into dedicated loathing? In short, is school the place where children learn to hate? </p> <p>Cedric Cullingford, professor of education at Huddersfield University, writes: \"The home is the seed-bed on which the tendency to prejudice can be grown. It is the school that sees this tendency flourish.\" For Cullingford, the fostering of prejudice, from snobbery to xenophobia, is a consequence of the very structures and priorities of school organisation - an inevitable, if undesired, product of the current learning system despite the best efforts of teachers. Add-ons to the curriculum, those once-weekly lessons in personal and social education, are bound to fail, Cullingford believes. \"The problem is that the addition of more knowledge, whatever the subject, does not address the issue of the purpose of the school.\" </p> <p>The purpose of the school? Not to educate: at least, not according to Cullingford's definition. The conviction of his new book Prejudice: From Individual Identity to Nationalism in Young People is that no child who'd received an education worthy of the word could so blithely make remarks such as these by a seven-year-old girl: \"There's quite a lot of Chinese people here. My friend, Di Wan, she's Chinese and people pick on her. They go like that [pulls at eyes] and everyone says where's Di two and three? I feel quite sorry for her. I still wouldn't like to be Chinese, though. I don't really like their eyes myself. And I don't like the way they speak.\" </p> <p>The inconsistency between individual empathy and generalised enmity is so marked as to seem absurd. Yet it may be the very stuff of future chauvinism: blanket dislike of such staggering illogic it seems impervious to argument or reason. Conventionally, enlightenment is seen as flowing from accumulated knowledge. But Cullingford's case is that in school life the opposite habitually occurs. For him the key to it is that the preoccupations of schools, the increasingly inflexible agendas that they work to, might almost have been designed to stop children finding out the things they're most eager to know and so prevent them from acquiring the most valuable intellectual tool of all - the ability to think critically. \"When children first go to school they are full of curiosity,\" Cullingford says. \"They have big questions in their minds: what is the meaning of life? Schools do not help them answer it.\" </p> <p>The book's thesis is informed by \"child-centred\" research - interviews with mostly seven- and eight-year-olds about their feelings for themselves and others. In youngsters' talk Cullingford detects their capacity for going either way: for embracing the rich diversity of life or for retreating from it in fear, with all the destructive potential that entails. </p> <p>From very early on children become repositories of unrefined information, much of it acquired from television, be it Neighbours or the news. Africa is full of thin, unclothed people, America runs with money. Germans, of course, are war-like. And the French? \"Frogs' legs and snails,\" says a seven-year-old boy. \"Some people are artists. They sometimes wear blue striped jumpers, T-shirts and a blue hat with a little, a tiny knob on it. I've seen it on television.\" </p> <p>They are keenly aware, too, of their own need for individual love and attention and the insecurities arising from a fear of its lack. Also, the children dream, especially of space - not just physical but psychological. They imagine bigger gardens, bigger homes and having bedrooms of their own where there'd be freedom from the plague of other people. \"I've got a big bedroom to myself, says one boy interviewed. \"Peace and quiet. Cos when I read, I don't like people talking.\" </p> <p>Such are the attitudes and concerns children bring to the school environment. What they need most urgently, Cullingford contends, is for these to be guided down avenues of social insight to help them qualify emotions with reason. Instead there is a clamour of closed doors. School has little time for such concerns. What is more, children know it. \"They are quite clear that school is there for teachers, not for them,\" Cullingford says, \"even if the teachers are nice. When teachers put them under pressure, children know why it is - it's because teachers are concerned about test results, league tables and so forth.\" </p> <p>School is a rigid hierarchy, which children recognise they are expected to fit into. Most do. Most adapt and conform. They stick by the rules and strive to produce what's asked for, boring and meaningless though it so often seems to them. </p> <p> Meanwhile, there is the other side of school life, the unofficial one of brittle friendships, angry conflicts, pleasurable play but also fear of bullying. The reply of \"nothing\" is so typically heard by parents reckless enough to ask their children what they did in school today that it is now celebrated in a TV commercial. Maybe that's because children's real business of the day is not the literacy hour but the unending switchback of interpersonal concerns. </p> <p>It is in this unofficial realm - far more influential than its counterpart - that children most urgently require the skills school does not teach them or, significantly, those that industry requires: communication, flexibility, a capacity to reason and objectively appraise. It is also the domain in which those pupils least able to oblige the official school agenda take dangerous refuge. It is here that a school's \"failures\" and those unable to fit in for other reasons draw comfort from the menacing solidarity of the outlaw peer group or, by contrast, the bitter consolations of isolation, as vividly expressed by this eight-year-old girl. </p> <p>Q: \"Do you like anything about yourself?\" A: \"No.\" Q: \"Nothing at all?\" A: \"No. I just don't like the other children. They pick on me. They're rude. They say naughty things.\" Q: \"If I could wave my magic wand and change something about you, what would it be?\" A: \"A horse.\" Q: \"You'd like to be a horse?\" A: \"Yeah, cos they're nice creatures. They're nice animals.\" Q: \"Do you like being you?\" A: \"No.\" </p> <p>Through such a lens of disaffection, a child's school is an oppressor and other groups of pupils are their undifferentiated foes. In their language of self-loathing, paranoia and rage do we hear the sound of greater hatreds yet to come? Is this what is meant by \"excellence for all?\" </p> <p> \u0095 Prejudice is published by Kogan Page, \u00a318.99.</p>",

Add-ons to the curriculum, those once-weekly lessons in personal and social education, are bound to fail, Cullingford believes. \"The problem is that the addition of more knowledge, whatever the subject, does not address the issue of the purpose of the school.\" The purpose of the school? Not to educate: at least, not according to Cullingford's definition. The conviction of his new book Prejudice: From Individual Identity to Nationalism in Young People is that no child who'd received an education worthy of the word could so blithely make remarks such as these by a seven-year-old girl: \"There's quite a lot of Chinese people here. My friend, Di Wan, she's Chinese and people pick on her. They go like that [pulls at eyes] and everyone says where's Di two and three? I feel quite sorry for her. I still wouldn't like to be Chinese, though. I don't really like their eyes myself. And I don't like the way they speak.\" The inconsistency between individual empathy and generalised enmity is so marked as to seem absurd. Yet it may be the very stuff of future chauvinism: blanket dislike of such staggering illogic it seems impervious to argument or reason. Conventionally, enlightenment is seen as flowing from accumulated knowledge. But Cullingford's case is that in school life the opposite habitually occurs. For him the key to it is that the preoccupations of schools, the increasingly inflexible agendas that they work to, might almost have been designed to stop children finding out the things they're most eager to know and so prevent them from acquiring the most valuable intellectual tool of all - the ability to think critically. \"When children first go to school they are full of curiosity,\" Cullingford says. \"They have big questions in their minds: what is the meaning of life? Schools do not help them answer it.\" The book's thesis is informed by \"child-centred\" research - interviews with mostly seven- and eight-year-olds about their feelings for themselves and others. In youngsters' talk Cullingford detects their capacity for going either way: for embracing the rich diversity of life or for retreating from it in fear, with all the destructive potential that entails. From very early on children become repositories of unrefined information, much of it acquired from television, be it Neighbours or the news. Africa is full of thin, unclothed people, America runs with money. Germans, of course, are war-like. And the French? \"Frogs' legs and snails,\" says a seven-year-old boy. \"Some people are artists. They sometimes wear blue striped jumpers, T-shirts and a blue hat with a little, a tiny knob on it. I've seen it on television.\" They are keenly aware, too, of their own need for individual love and attention and the insecurities arising from a fear of its lack. Also, the children dream, especially of space - not just physical but psychological. They imagine bigger gardens, bigger homes and having bedrooms of their own where there'd be freedom from the plague of other people. \"I've got a big bedroom to myself, says one boy interviewed. \"Peace and quiet. Cos when I read, I don't like people talking.\" Such are the attitudes and concerns children bring to the school environment. What they need most urgently, Cullingford contends, is for these to be guided down avenues of social insight to help them qualify emotions with reason. Instead there is a clamour of closed doors. School has little time for such concerns. What is more, children know it. \"They are quite clear that school is there for teachers, not for them,\" Cullingford says, \"even if the teachers are nice. When teachers put them under pressure, children know why it is - it's because teachers are concerned about test results, league tables and so forth.\" School is a rigid hierarchy, which children recognise they are expected to fit into. Most do. Most adapt and conform. They stick by the rules and strive to produce what's asked for, boring and meaningless though it so often seems to them. Meanwhile, there is the other side of school life, the unofficial one of brittle friendships, angry conflicts, pleasurable play but also fear of bullying. The reply of \"nothing\" is so typically heard by parents reckless enough to ask their children what they did in school today that it is now celebrated in a TV commercial. Maybe that's because children's real business of the day is not the literacy hour but the unending switchback of interpersonal concerns. It is in this unofficial realm - far more influential than its counterpart - that children most urgently require the skills school does not teach them or, significantly, those that industry requires: communication, flexibility, a capacity to reason and objectively appraise. It is also the domain in which those pupils least able to oblige the official school agenda take dangerous refuge. It is here that a school's \"failures\" and those unable to fit in for other reasons draw comfort from the menacing solidarity of the outlaw peer group or, by contrast, the bitter consolations of isolation, as vividly expressed by this eight-year-old girl. Q: \"Do you like anything about yourself?\" A: \"No.\" Q: \"Nothing at all?\" A: \"No. I just don't like the other children. They pick on me. They're rude. They say naughty things.\" Q: \"If I could wave my magic wand and change something about you, what would it be?\" A: \"A horse.\" Q: \"You'd like to be a horse?\" A: \"Yeah, cos they're nice creatures. They're nice animals.\" Q: \"Do you like being you?\" A: \"No.\" Through such a lens of disaffection, a child's school is an oppressor and other groups of pupils are their undifferentiated foes. In their language of self-loathing, paranoia and rage do we hear the sound of greater hatreds yet to come? Is this what is meant by \"excellence for all?\" \u0095 Prejudice is published by Kogan Page, \u00a318.99.",

This wouldn't give the full picture of how the school had done by its kids, so I'd then look at the latest Ofsted report to look at the key stage 3 results to see how the school had done in comparison with similar schools. Schools are banded according to the number of pupils on free meals; not everyone accepts this as an accurate way to compare schools, but it does at least give an indication of how well a school is doing. </p> <p>\"I would also expect to see 95% or more of pupils achieving A* to G grades at GCSE; any less and it could suggest that the school had a major problem with kids dropping out of education entirely in year 11. </p> <p>\"Within the Ofsted report there is a section labelled 'Key Issues'. I would look extremely closely at these. Some may bother you, others may not. For example, if it was reported that the school had no regular act of religious worship, I would not be at all concerned; if, however, it said that the school needed to make significant progress in English then I would want to know from the teaching staff what steps had been taken to act on this. </p> <p>\"Finally I would look in the school prospectus for the difference between the boys' and girls' GCSE results. If there was a significant difference, it would suggest that not much was being demanded of the kids and that they were being left to get on with it themselves. As a rule, girls are more conscientious than boys and will do the work even when they're not supervised. Boys will generally use the opportunity to do nothing.\" </p> <p><strong> The headteacher</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> John Adam is head of Crookhorn Community School in Waterlooville, Hants. He has three children.</strong> </p> <p> \"After reading the school report on the Ofsted website (<a href=\"http://www.ofsted.gov.uk\">www.ofsted.gov.uk</a>), the first piece of information I would want is the figure for the average total passes at GCSE, as the headline figures of five or more passes at grade C or above give an incomplete picture. Schools can achieve good headline figures in a number of subtle ways; some may even make it clear to parents that less able children will struggle at the school. This may deter them from applying. Schools are under severe pressure and they can focus their main teaching effort on those who stand a good chance of reaching grade C and above at potential cost to the others. I would like to see how many children were not entered for any GCSEs and how many had five passes at any grade to assess how well the school had helped the less able to fulfil their potential. </p> <p>\"I would also want to know that the headteacher took full responsibility for everything that went on within the school. A key question to ask here is what line the school takes on children who misbehave on the way to and from school. A good head will consider that the school's reputation extends well beyond the front gate. </p> <p>\"Not all schools are organised in the same way, so I would be keen to know whether pupils are taught in mixed ability groups or in group ability sets. If they were taught in sets I would want to know on what basis the assessment is made and what opportunities exist for movement between the different groupings and when they will happen. </p> <p>\"To see how the school communicated with parents, I would ask to see a typical report, with the child's name blanked out, to check that it was in clear English - intelligible and informative about a child's progress, in regard to his or her potential and also in relation to peers. I would also want to know how often reports would be issued and how often the school would be in touch with me. </p> <p>\"All schools have to impose sanctions on their pupils, but a good school would do so within a framework of rewards that reinforces positive behaviour. Children have to be made aware when they have done wrong but they need to know they have a second chance, so I would question teachers carefully about this. </p> <p>\"Parents are a good source of information, though some have private agendas. To offset this I would target members of the Parent Teacher Association, particularly those who have had two or three children at the school. PTA members will have had direct involvement with the school and its teachers and are best placed to talk about the ethos and policies of the school. Staff turnover can also give a pointer to staff morale, but one would want to be careful about jumping to conclusions. If staff were moving to take on deputy headships or other promotions, you could assume that the school was a great training ground for teachers and therefore good for your child. A simple question asking how many new members of staff the school has taken on should be sufficient to get this information. </p> <p>\"Most schools are experts at putting their best foot forward at open days, but they can't cover up the basic maintenance of the buildings. If it looks really shabby, then it is likely that school morale is low. While looking at classroom displays I would want to see that the full range of abilities are represented, not just the best. </p> <p>\"I would find it hard to believe there was any school that was unaffected by bullying and the school prospectus should state its policy clearly. However, I would also want to check this out with other parents and pupils. Pupils are always a good source of feedback and I would give my child the chance to visit the school and talk to the other children. </p> <p>\"Finally, I would check how open the school was to external benchmarking, such as Investors in People (the Cabinet Office charter mark for quality public services), Investors in Careers (run by the Careers Service) and the School's Curriculum Award (run by the School's Curriculum Award Trust). Of course, it's not essential for a school to get involved in these, but the assessments are rigorous, so you will know the school has the self-confidence to welcome external evaluation.\" </p> <p><strong> The head of department</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Marion Bird is head of religious and social education at Orleans Park School, Twickenham, London. She has three children.</strong> </p> <p> \"You can get a good feel for a school at a visit by observing the relationships between teachers and children. Are the pupils helping out, asking questions and generally getting involved or are the teachers doing all the work? If it's the latter, there's a fair chance the school may not be a dynamic and exciting place for children to learn. </p> <p>\"I would want to see a range of work on display to be reassured that all ability groups were included. I wouldn't be too worried about seeing spelling mistakes in exercise books, but I would expect to see signs that learning was taking place, so I would be looking out for encouraging comments next to work, together with some form of obvious assessment. </p> <p>\"It's hard for schools to gloss over weak points as parents have access to league table results and Ofsted reports, but most parents tend to focus on English, maths and science. I would also want to know more about other departments, especially if my child had expressed an interest in them. </p> <p>\"The head's address at an open day can also be a good indicator. It may be well rehearsed but if they speak with passion and leadership, it's likely they speak the same way at assembly; if it's downbeat manner then the kids are almost certainly going to find the headteacher uninspirational too, and won't be motivated to do their best. </p> <p>\"The best way to find out about a school, though, is to ask questions of the staff and pupils. A good, confident school will allow its senior pupils to take parents on a tour; they will be mostly diplomatic but they can be quite open, too. Hopefully, your child will be able to come with you on the tour and this is their opportunity to ask about anything that has been worrying them. However, do talk through all their concerns before the visit so that you can discuss them with staff and pupils if your child doesn't.\" </p> <p><strong> The teacher</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Elena Mauro is special needs coordinator at Loughborough Junior School in London. She has one son and one stepdaughter.</strong> </p> <p> \"Parents often find it hard to be realistic about their children's abilities, but you can't make an accurate assessment of a school without making an informed judgment of what your child needs. You need to ask yourself questions like, 'Is he better at maths than English and in what sort of environment does he learn best?' Only then can you ask the right questions to find out whether the school can be responsive to those needs. For instance, if I had a child with special needs I would want to know that there would be provision from day one and not halfway through the first term. </p> <p>\"League tables give a very partial view: I would want to know details of the intake and the proportion of special needs or bilingual children to get an idea of how much value the school has added. And if there are kids hanging around aimlessly then you can safely assume that morale is low. </p> <p>\"Secondary schools are an alien world to primary schools, and children have to go from being big babies to mini-adults in the course of the summer. Many find it very difficult to adjust to the transition of not having one class teacher and having to learn their way round a new environment where they are the youngest, so I would want to know what measures the school took to ease the new intake into the routine. For the same reasons, I would also want to know that there would be some children with similar backgrounds to my child's so that he would fit in and make friends. </p> <p>\"I would also want to see examples of the children's work in all age groups. Standards can vary in different year groups and I would want to be satisfied that progress was being made year on year. To make sure I wasn't just being shown the best work, I would like each child's work books to be made available.\"</p>",

It may be well rehearsed but if they speak with passion and leadership, it's likely they speak the same way at assembly; if it's downbeat manner then the kids are almost certainly going to find the headteacher uninspirational too, and won't be motivated to do their best. \"The best way to find out about a school, though, is to ask questions of the staff and pupils. A good, confident school will allow its senior pupils to take parents on a tour; they will be mostly diplomatic but they can be quite open, too. Hopefully, your child will be able to come with you on the tour and this is their opportunity to ask about anything that has been worrying them. However, do talk through all their concerns before the visit so that you can discuss them with staff and pupils if your child doesn't.\" The teacher Elena Mauro is special needs coordinator at Loughborough Junior School in London. She has one son and one stepdaughter. \"Parents often find it hard to be realistic about their children's abilities, but you can't make an accurate assessment of a school without making an informed judgment of what your child needs. You need to ask yourself questions like, 'Is he better at maths than English and in what sort of environment does he learn best?' Only then can you ask the right questions to find out whether the school can be responsive to those needs. For instance, if I had a child with special needs I would want to know that there would be provision from day one and not halfway through the first term. \"League tables give a very partial view: I would want to know details of the intake and the proportion of special needs or bilingual children to get an idea of how much value the school has added. And if there are kids hanging around aimlessly then you can safely assume that morale is low. \"Secondary schools are an alien world to primary schools, and children have to go from being big babies to mini-adults in the course of the summer. Many find it very difficult to adjust to the transition of not having one class teacher and having to learn their way round a new environment where they are the youngest, so I would want to know what measures the school took to ease the new intake into the routine. For the same reasons, I would also want to know that there would be some children with similar backgrounds to my child's so that he would fit in and make friends. \"I would also want to see examples of the children's work in all age groups. Standards can vary in different year groups and I would want to be satisfied that progress was being made year on year. To make sure I wasn't just being shown the best work, I would like each child's work books to be made available.\"",

      "bodyText": "Russia is set to clash with the US and Britain at the UN security council this week after confirming it is to revive its scheduled flights to Iraq. Britain and the US regard the Russian move as breaching the sanctions regime imposed against the Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein, for trying to take over Kuwait and starting the 1990-91 Gulf war. A Russian spokesman tried a different interpretation yesterday, claiming commercial flights were not covered by UN resolutions against Iraq. Scheduled passenger flights between Moscow and Baghdad would drive a hole through the crumbling sanctions regime and encourage President Saddam to continue to defy the west. There have been individual flights from Russia and France in the last month, but scheduled flights would be a big change. Iraq's minister for transport, Ahmed Murtada Ahmed Khalil, on a visit to Iran yesterday, disclosed that Aeroflot, would be resuming commercial flights in a fortnight. He asked the Iranian government to allow the Russians to use its airspace, according to the Iranian news agency, Irna. An Aeroflot spokeswoman had said in Moscow earlier in the day that the 51% state-owned carrier intended to resume flights to Iraq. It had signed a memorandum of understanding with Iraqi Airways, she said, but gave no indication at that point of when the service would start. In London, a Foreign Office source said last night: \"The resumption of scheduled flights amounts to a resumption of trading relations, and that would be a breach of sanctions.\" As well as trying to shore up the sanctions regime, the US and Britain also send their warplanes over northern and southern Iraq, denying air space to Iraqi fighters. The resumption of Russian commercial flights would complicate an already tense and dangerous situation. Both Russia and France - eager to do business with Iraq - have tried at the UN to persuade the US and Britain to end the no-fly zones, set up after Baghdad cracked down on northern Iraq's Kurds and southern Iraq's Shi'ites following the Gulf war. A Russian spokesman in London defended the decision to resume flights: \"According to our point of view, nothing in the resolution of the security council forbids it.\" A British-inspired resolution was passed at the UN security council last December holding out the possibility of a compromise over sanctions but Baghdad has rejected it. The new move by Russia, the country's London spokesman said, should be taken as a signal that the world community must act to overcome this impasse: \"We have to do something.\" The US and Britain have become increasingly isolated this year. While the international community feels repugnance towards President Saddam, there is also a growing sense that sanctions and the no-fly zone are hurting civilians rather than the regime. Britain has shown signs of wilting but the US, especially in a presidential election year, has remained resolute. Opponents of sanctions claimed that the US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, who was in Paris yesterday, threatened France that any country flying to Iraq would be denied the right to fly to the US.

If Tony Blair acquired the middle classes and Mondeo man, Hague is trying to win nicked Nissan man.</p> <p>He said he wanted policemen to be more accessible and have desks in local stores - \"cops in shops\" as he called it, though he didn't say what kind. Butchers, perhaps, which would mean cops in chop shops, or car forecourts - peelers 'n' dealers.</p> <p>People would ask for an arrest warrant and 20 Rothmans, from the old bill at the till. The Tories assembled behind the press cheered in unison - claques in packs.</p> <p>But it's all unreal, like the conference stage, which is made of corrugated perspex shapes, backlit so it looks like Stevenage Halfords at night. The lights are colour coded: red, white and blue for the constitution debate, and, suppose, orange for Northern Ireland, a nasty shade of brown for agriculture, white all over for immigration policy.</p> <p>There is a peculiarly shaped little door at the back, and people run out as if on a talent show. \"Tonight, Matthew, I shall be agriculture minister!\" \"Good luck, Tim, and remember, votes cost no more than 10p!\"</p> <p>The chairman asked us to greet, \"William Hague, with Ffion.\" They're pathetically proud that they've managed to get her up on board, smiling and waving, and never miss a chance to remind us.</p> <p>Then the chairman said he was about to welcome, \"our very own, the right honourable Michael Ancram,\" a phrase which combines new Tory matiness with traditional servility.</p> <p>But before then we were to greet John Major, the man who, we were reminded, had created the lottery which in turn had paid for all that Olympic gold! Well, why not? If John Prescott can claim credit for the weather, why can't we thank John Major for our great victory in the upside down coxless sculls, or whatever it was?</p> <p>Michael Ancram raved about \"pundit busters\" and \"pundit defying victories\". \"Was Mr Blair's speech last week just another cynical regurgitation of spin?\" he asked. What a horrible image it conjured up; you've stayed too late at the party, shovelled down all that Rioja and curry flavour Doritos, you know you shouldn't have - time to dash for the loo and a cynical regurgitation!</p> <p>Then an amazing scene, as the Tory candidates for the next election marched onto the stage in regional groups, all accompanied by a ponderous techno-beat and a shouted slogan: \"The North-east: Raising pensions! Thrum, thrum! The East Midlands: Fair taxes, not stealth taxes! Throb, throb! The South-east: capital punishment restored to our schools!\" (Or something like that.) Thump, thump! The candidates clapped along like a stadium full of born agains at a mass wedding.</p> <p>The stage was soon dangerously packed. Delegates were supposed to be thrilled and energised; I merely reflected what an awful lot of seats they need to win.</p> <p>Then the shadow cabinet arrived to clap along, all those superstars of the next government: Theresa May, Angela Browning, Tim Yeo, Gary Streeter.</p> <p>And finally, \"William Hague - with Ffion!\" The poor man sounds like a new floor cleaner: \"New lemony-fresh Hague - now with added Ffion!\"</p>",

He said he wanted policemen to be more accessible and have desks in local stores - \"cops in shops\" as he called it, though he didn't say what kind. Butchers, perhaps, which would mean cops in chop shops, or car forecourts - peelers 'n' dealers. People would ask for an arrest warrant and 20 Rothmans, from the old bill at the till. The Tories assembled behind the press cheered in unison - claques in packs. But it's all unreal, like the conference stage, which is made of corrugated perspex shapes, backlit so it looks like Stevenage Halfords at night. The lights are colour coded: red, white and blue for the constitution debate, and, suppose, orange for Northern Ireland, a nasty shade of brown for agriculture, white all over for immigration policy. There is a peculiarly shaped little door at the back, and people run out as if on a talent show. \"Tonight, Matthew, I shall be agriculture minister!\" \"Good luck, Tim, and remember, votes cost no more than 10p!\" The chairman asked us to greet, \"William Hague, with Ffion.\" They're pathetically proud that they've managed to get her up on board, smiling and waving, and never miss a chance to remind us. Then the chairman said he was about to welcome, \"our very own, the right honourable Michael Ancram,\" a phrase which combines new Tory matiness with traditional servility. But before then we were to greet John Major, the man who, we were reminded, had created the lottery which in turn had paid for all that Olympic gold! Well, why not? If John Prescott can claim credit for the weather, why can't we thank John Major for our great victory in the upside down coxless sculls, or whatever it was? Michael Ancram raved about \"pundit busters\" and \"pundit defying victories\". \"Was Mr Blair's speech last week just another cynical regurgitation of spin?\" he asked. What a horrible image it conjured up; you've stayed too late at the party, shovelled down all that Rioja and curry flavour Doritos, you know you shouldn't have - time to dash for the loo and a cynical regurgitation! Then an amazing scene, as the Tory candidates for the next election marched onto the stage in regional groups, all accompanied by a ponderous techno-beat and a shouted slogan: \"The North-east: Raising pensions! Thrum, thrum! The East Midlands: Fair taxes, not stealth taxes! Throb, throb! The South-east: capital punishment restored to our schools!\" (Or something like that.) Thump, thump! The candidates clapped along like a stadium full of born agains at a mass wedding. The stage was soon dangerously packed. Delegates were supposed to be thrilled and energised; I merely reflected what an awful lot of seats they need to win. Then the shadow cabinet arrived to clap along, all those superstars of the next government: Theresa May, Angela Browning, Tim Yeo, Gary Streeter. And finally, \"William Hague - with Ffion!\" The poor man sounds like a new floor cleaner: \"New lemony-fresh Hague - now with added Ffion!\"",

The US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, described his visit to the site - known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif - as \"definitely counter-productive\". The French president, Jacques Chirac, called it an \"irresponsible provocation\", while the French foreign minister, Hubert V\u00e9drine, accused Mr Sharon of acting \"for domestic political motives, at the most sensitive moment in peace negotiations\".

      "bodyText": "A state of war engulfed parts of the West Bank and Gaza strip yesterday as the Israeli army unleashed tanks and helicopter gunships against Palestinian rioters. The resort to Israel's military might defied appeals by world leaders to end the bloodiest violence for four years, and arrives amid deepening suspicions that the prime minister, Ehud Barak, is losing his grip on the situation. After five days of rioting, in which Palestinian security men joined forces with stone-throwing youths, the toll rose inexorably to 47 dead and more than 1,000 injured. These clashes are far more severe than earlier unrest in the West Bank and Gaza. During the intifada which erupted in 1987, Palestinians vented their rage with rocks. Now, they are joined in battle by Palestinian police forces, who are well trained and armed with automatic weapons. In the West Bank yesterday, the tanks took up position opposite luxury flats in Ramallah and trundled menacingly towards armed protesters in Nablus undercover from helicopter gunships firing at a Palestinian security position in Gaza. Alarm bells were ringing for Mr Barak as the violence moved decisively into the heartland of the Jewish state, with the first Israeli civilian killed yesterday morning. Israeli-Arab citizens wrought havoc in cities that were once models of peaceful co-existence. Mr Barak convened a special session of his security cabinet and appealed to Israeli Arabs, who make up nearly 20% of Israel's population of 6m, to cease their protests. \"No country can tolerate these kinds of violence scenes and disorder on the part of its citizens, as hurt as they may be,\" he said. Seven Israeli Arabs, 10 Palestinians and one Israeli Jew were killed yesterday in clashes that have been spreading from the green hills of the northern Galilee to towns such as Sakhnin and Acre and even to Jaffa, which runs into Tel Aviv. Most alarming for Israeli security forces was the spread of violence across the \"Green Line\", which divides Israel proper from the occupied Gaza strip and West Bank. At the Netzarim junction in the Gaza strip, troops fired anti-tank missiles and traded fire from helicopter gunships with members of the Palestinian security forces. Palestinians stormed a command post and plucked an Israeli flag from an abandoned watchtower. The first Israeli civilian to die in the violence was shot dead at close range as he drove to a popular shopping destination in the West Bank yesterday morning. A school bus travelling to the Jewish settlement of Shiloh also came under fire, but nobody was injured. Roads were closed in parts of Jerusalem and people evacuated from some isolated Jewish settlements. Meanwhile, with sentiments blunted by the unrelenting violence, there were new horrors, with reports that a two-year-old Palestinian girl was killed when her parents' car came under a hail of bullets on Sunday night. Despite the continued bloodshed, Mr Barak and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, appeared unmoved by international appeals for a ceasefire. Mr Barak warned: \"Bloodshed could cause great damage to the chances of continuing the peace process and a major deterioration.\" Mr Arafat retorted: \"Stop shooting our soldiers, our old people, our youths, our women. Get Israeli soldiers out of Palestinian cities and refugee camps.\" On the barricades and in the hospitals of Umm al-Fahm, they were chanting the same demand. In the emergency room of al-Hayaa clinic, angry young men jumped from their stretchers and hoisted their shirts to display the angry red bruises left by rubber bullets. \"Look what they did to me,\" said one. \"And I am a citizen of Israel.\" Although Umm al-Fahm is a stronghold of the Islamist movement which has radicalised Israeli Arabs in recent years, their decision to join the battle for Jerusalem was made not because of religion, but because of images of their Palestinian kin dying in the clashes. When the people of Umm al-Fahm took to the streets on Sunday, riot police opened up first with rubber bullets and then live fire. They killed Mohammed Jabreen, 25, a construction worker, who, friends say, harboured no greater ambition than to get married, buy a car and save enough money for his own flat. Yesterday's violence was intended to avenge that death. Overnight, rampaging mobs ransacked symbols of the Israeli state on the high street, including banks and the main post office. For a second day, they barricaded the entrance to the town, stopping traffic on the main highway through Israel's Galilee Then they set off for the funeral of the man killed in Sunday's clashes. Omri - as his friends called him - had seen the footage of the 12-year-old boy killed in Gaza at the weekend and decided to take to the streets. \"It wasn't a question of West Bank or Gaza or Israel,\" says Ahmed Jabreen, joining the circle of friends gathering near the dead man's house. \"All of us are one people. We are all one family.\" As the fighting spread through the West Bank and Gaza, Israeli settlers lay low.

      "bodyText": "William Hague's belated efforts to reposition the Tories inside the \"mainstream majority\" of British politics in time for the general election took a Bournemouth conference beating yesterday from the left and right of the party and its grassroots activists. Although the former prime minister John Major used a rare public speech to chivvy his successor as Tory leader towards consensus, understanding and multiracial \"inclusivity\", the unkindest cut on the opening day of the party conference was grassroots apathy towards Mr Hague's \"mini-manifesto\" ballot. Just 50,508 - 16.67% - of eligible members bothered to vote to endorse the mini-manifesto, \"Believing in Britain\", the Tory chairman, Michael Ancram, was forced to admit after an opening speech to the conference which claimed that the tide has turned decisively against Tony Blair. \"We know and, more importantly, our opponents know, that we can win,\" insisted Mr Ancram, savaging Mr Blair as a cynical liar who had fatally disappointed voters. In a speech to beleaguered Tory moderates last night Mr Major also itemised alleged Labour deceptions - from Kosovo and the economy to \"fibs about pensions\" - to argue that Blairism is a mixture of self-delusion and \"one of the most unscrupulous spin machines Britain has ever seen\". But he also warned that, to win an election, middle England's votes were not enough. \"We must reach out to all, the people in the slums, the people in need, the people outside the circle of rising prosperity, the black and brown and yellow Britons who are as much a part of our society as I am,\" Mr Major said. In the scramble towards the centre ground he will not be alone this week in asserting: \"We are the party that stands for one nation...a Tory who believes that consensus and understanding the point of view of others is a strength and not a weakness.\" Such talk contrasted sharply with cheers for \"quit Europe\" sentiments on the conference fringe. With the party's right wing now dominant in policy-making, the pro-Europe ex-minister Ian Taylor also warned against \"picking policies off the shelf\". More surprisingly, he was joined by another exile from the Hague shadow team, the rightwing MP David Davis. At a Guardian fringe meeting he spoke against over-reliance on focus groups and \"corrosive\" populism. After Labour's brief collapse in the post-fuel-crisis polls the Conservative leadership has persuaded itself it can win the expected May election after all. Like George W Bush, the Republican candidate for US president - whose tactics the Tories closely monitor - Mr Hague is keen to sound more compassionate as polling day looms. But the concentration on reconsolidating the core Tory vote - scattered in the 1997 landslide - with rightwing populist tactics for most of the past year has left Mr Hague too far from the centre ground where most elections are won. Claiming that Conservatives have answers, where Labour has only empty gestures, Mr Ancram used his keynote speech to address the problem head-on. \"This is our chance to show that, far from the shores of extremism upon which our opponents seek to place us, we are the party of the mainstream, sharing the values of the mainstream majority of this country,\" he said. Popping up all over the conference complex yesterday, Mr Hague himself joined in with an attack on the arrogant \"metropolitan elite\" which he said dominated New Labour thinking at the expense of rural Britain. He had already launched the new party policy for revitalising inner cities, building a more privatised structure on what have become Labour policies.",

      "body": "<p>A circle of 15 bullet holes on a cinder block wall, and a smear of darkening blood. That is what marks the spot where a terrified 12-year-old boy spent his final moments, cowering in his father's arms, before he was hit by a final shot to the stomach, and slumped over, dead.</p> <p>Those last minutes in the life of Mohammed al-Durrah, captured in sickening detail by a Palestinian cameraman working for French TV, have taken on a power of their own. His death, aired around the world on Saturday night, has become the single searing image of these days of bloody rioting.</p> <p>The pictures of Mohammed's death seemed not just to encapsulate the horror of these last five days but also to have become its motor. Outside the al-Durrah home in a sandy lane of the Bourij refugee camp, children his age and even younger are fighting over photocopied strips of the final eight frames in the boy's life. Here, the version of his death includes images too disturbing for most broadcasters: the loosening of a dying boy's grip on his father, Jamal, and his father's convulsive twitch when he was struck by more rounds.</p> <p>Though more Palestinians have been killed since Mohammed's death - including a two-year-old yesterday - it is his image that haunts Israel. For all of the claims of the prime minister, Ehud Barak, and other officials that their soldiers only fire to protect Israeli lives, Mohammed's death seems an irrefutable reply.</p> <p>The images of al-Dirreh and his son cowering, vainly, behind a barrel would have been emotive enough if, as first reports suggested, they were caught in the crossfire between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian police or protesters. But by the end of the weekend the evidence was pointing to a still more chilling conclusion: that the 12-year-old boy and his father were deliberately targeted by Israeli soldiers.</p> <p>For Israelis, the camera footage of Mohammed's death makes exceedingly uncomfortable viewing. Which might explain why - for all the furore his death has caused worldwide - it has caused barely a ripple here. The English-language edition of the Ha'aretz newspaper, the most liberal of Israel's press, confined its reporting to 21 lines on the front page, focused on an Israeli army investigation into the killing. For those who have been tracking the pattern of violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the location of Mohammed's death could almost have been predicted.</p> <p>Over the years, Netzarim junction, where Mohammed was killed, has been a regular point of confrontation between Israeli troops, and Palestinian youths. The source of the friction on an otherwise unremarkable junction on Gaza's main coastal road is an Israeli army post, a hunkering fortress of armoured steel and concrete with watchtowers on each of its four corners. The post, on the north-west corner of the junction, is the frontline defence for the Jewish settlement of Netzarim to the west. So contentious is the Jewish settlement that its occupants - a mere 60 families - are under strict orders to travel only by military convoys.</p> <p>For Palestinians, the heavily guarded Netzarim settlement is a symbol of their continued occupation, seven years after the start of the peace process. So, by extension, is the post at Netzarim junction, which any Palestinians from Bourij or the other refugee camps to the south have to negotiate, if they want to visit Gaza City.</p> <p>\"When the people of Palestine are crying out against Israel, they find this place to throw stones. It is a target for all the anger against the people sitting in their belly and in their bedroom,\" says Brigadier General Osama al-Ali.</p> <p>He was speaking from the other installation that played a crucial part in Mohammed's death. As well as the Israeli position, the junction also houses a small command post of Palestinian security forces who, under interim peace arrangements, are mandated to jointly patrol the area with Israeli troops.</p> <p>The post, a small hut really, lies diagonally across the junction from the Israeli position, at a distance of perhaps 100 yards.</p> <p>This was the stage on which the al-Durrahs blundered, father and son, on Saturday morning. Although Mohammed's uncles feel obliged to describe him as a studious boy, his mother and his six surviving siblings recall a playful child who wanted always to be where the action was. His mother, Amal, says he had wanderlust and would often run off to the beach or, when there were protests, to watch the older boys throw rocks.</p> <p>On Friday night, in his home in the Bourij refugee camp, Mohammed was watching the rioting on television. \"When he saw what happened in Jerusalem on TV, he asked me: 'Can I go to join the protests in Netzarim?' I did not dare to answer him. I did not want him to go,\" she says.</p> <p>Which is why on that fateful morning, Jamal al-Dirreh says he took steps to steer his son away from trouble. The two set off for the used car auction in Gaza City. Mohammed was excited at the outing. They started for home by taxi, but, with the trouble already starting, the driver refused to cross Netzarim. Jamal and Mohammed tried to cross the junction on foot; it was a fatal mistake.</p> <p>Caught in a burst of firing, the pair sought shelter behind a concrete water butt, about 15 yards to the east of the Palestinian post, diagonally opposite the Israeli position. The father gestured frantically towards the Israelis, as if pleading with them to stop firing. They did not.</p> <p>\"They were cleaning the area. Of course they saw the father,\" says Talal Abu-Rama, the camera man who watched the horror unfold. \"They were aiming at the boy, and that is what surprised me, yes, because they were shooting at him, not only one time, but many times.\"</p> <p>The result of that salvo is visible on the cinderblock wall. Aside from the circle of bullet holes - most of them below waist level - the expanse of wall is largely unscarred. This appeared to suggest that the Israeli fire was targeted at the father and son.</p> <p>The impression is reinforced by other Palestinians at the scene, including a volunteer in the ambulance which tried to get the pair out. \"There was still some breath left in him when we reached the ambulance, but when we opened the doors, they started shooting again,\" says Bassam al-Bilbays, who was riding with the ambulance. The driver was shot dead.</p> <p>Inevitably, the Israeli army version of Mohammed's death is rather different. Although the army expressed regret about the boy's death, it said the soldiers in their armoured post had been under fire. \"I am sorry for this kid. But we are sure that this kid and his father were not there by accident. They were there like the others throwing stones, and throwing Molotovs [petrol bombs],\" Major-General Yom Tov Samia told Israeli radio.</p> <p>But in an interview with Israeli television, General Samia suggested the boy had not been killed by Israelis at all, but by Palestinian police, or rioters: \"I have no doubt that the gunfire, as it appears in the television close-up, was not from Israeli soldiers.\"</p> <p>That explanation is also difficult to sustain. During the fury of these clashes, Palestinian forces have turned their guns on Israeli troops - rather than try to contain their own people. The Palestinian General al-Ali admits his men did open fire at the Israelis. However, he claims that his men did not try to exact revenge until much later on that bloody afternoon.</p> <p>\"We saw our kids dying and we could not help them,\" he said. \"Of course, some people went mad later in the afternoon, when they saw what happened.\"</p> <p>Palestinians at the scene - including the cameraman - also cast doubt on the Israeli claim that father and son were caught in the crossfire between the two security forces. \"At the beginning of the clash, there was some shooting from the same area, but after five minutes they [the Palestinians] ran away from there. Nobody was shooting from the base,\" says Abu Rameh. He says he heard fire from only one direction - the Israeli camp.</p> <p>Abu Rameh also believes it unlikely that the Israeli fire could have been directed further down the road from the water butt where the al-Durrahs sought shelter. \"In that whole area, there was nobody except me, the boy and his father,\" the camera man says.</p> <p>Whatever the truth about the circumstances surrounding his death, Mohammed's terrified face has now entered the grim gallery of images that have come to symbolise - and often to powerfully influence - a conflict. That is of little comfort to his mother, Amal al-Durrah. She keeps imagining he will walk in the door to check on the love birds in their pink cage.</p> <p>\"Nothing good will come of this.

      "body": "<p>President Slobodan Milosevic issued a defiant challenge to his political enemies yesterday, dubbing the Serb opposition attempting to topple him from power as western lackeys who would lead the country into war and poverty.</p> <p>In his first televised address to the nation since the disputed presidential election on September 24, Mr Milosevic insisted that he had no intention of admitting defeat. Yugoslav officials have called a run-off vote for Sunday, which the opposition says it will boycott because his challenger Vojislav Kostunica won outright in the first round.</p> <p>In his 15-minute address, Mr Milosevic warned that if the opposition took office Yugoslavia \"would inevitably break up\". All opposition plans, he declared, were initiated by Nato and western countries.</p> <p>\"Our policy guarantees peace,\" he said, while the opposition promoted \"clashes and hostility\". Without him Yugoslavia would be \"occupied by foreign forces\".</p> <p>The robust statement came on the day the opposition tried to bring the country to a halt by launching a general strike designed to force him from office. Mr Milosevic will have gained renewed confidence by the fact that the strike failed to take hold, with opposition leaders conceding that the turnout was disappointing.</p> <p>The Yugoslav president accused his opponents of resorting to \"bribing, blackmailing with money from the west\" to bring the country to a standstill. But he said that Yugoslavia's laws would be applied to prevent a \"western invasion\".</p> <p>The defiance from Belgrade ran counter to attempts by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to solve the crisis by calling on Mr Milosevic and Vojislav Kostunica, his main rival, to travel to Moscow this week for talks.</p> <p>Mr Putin's attempt at a negotiated settlement followed a meeting of key Kremlin officials on Yugoslavia yesterday after which the Russian president said the mounting tension in Serbia was turning into a threat to European stability.</p> <p>It was not clear whether Mr Milosevic, in particular, would agree to the Russian offer of mediation. His brother Borislav, the Yugoslav ambassador in Moscow, dismissed all talk of mediation in Belgrade which also reacted negatively at the weekend to a Kremlin offer to send the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, to Yugoslavia.</p> <p>But with Moscow shifting from being Mr Milosevic's traditional backer to a more even-handed role in the current stand-off while seeking to be the peace broker, Mr Putin is gambling that he can mediate a peaceful handover of power in Belgrade in what would be a triumphant first big foray into international diplomacy and crisis management.</p> <p>While Mr Putin has recognised that Mr Kostunica won last week's election, according to the German government following a telephone conversation between Mr Putin and Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, yesterday's Putin statement, issued while he was en route to India for a four-day visit, also made a nod to the Milosevic camp by talking of a second round.</p> <p>But in the latest of several signals that the Kremlin is distancing itself from Milosevic and discreetly backing Mr Kostunica, one of Mr Putin's closest aides, Sergei Ivanov, the head of the Kremlin's security council, said Yugoslavia needed a legitimate president recognised by \"the world community\".</p> <p>Greece, an Orthodox country like Russia and Serbia, said it was discussing the possibility of helping to organise a recount of the first-round vote with Russia and France, currently in the European Union chair. The renewed Balkan crisis also featured at talks in Paris yesterday between the French government, Madeleine Albright, the US secretary of state, and top EU foreign policy officials.</p>",

      "bodyText": "President Slobodan Milosevic issued a defiant challenge to his political enemies yesterday, dubbing the Serb opposition attempting to topple him from power as western lackeys who would lead the country into war and poverty. In his first televised address to the nation since the disputed presidential election on September 24, Mr Milosevic insisted that he had no intention of admitting defeat. Yugoslav officials have called a run-off vote for Sunday, which the opposition says it will boycott because his challenger Vojislav Kostunica won outright in the first round. In his 15-minute address, Mr Milosevic warned that if the opposition took office Yugoslavia \"would inevitably break up\". All opposition plans, he declared, were initiated by Nato and western countries. \"Our policy guarantees peace,\" he said, while the opposition promoted \"clashes and hostility\". Without him Yugoslavia would be \"occupied by foreign forces\". The robust statement came on the day the opposition tried to bring the country to a halt by launching a general strike designed to force him from office. Mr Milosevic will have gained renewed confidence by the fact that the strike failed to take hold, with opposition leaders conceding that the turnout was disappointing. The Yugoslav president accused his opponents of resorting to \"bribing, blackmailing with money from the west\" to bring the country to a standstill. But he said that Yugoslavia's laws would be applied to prevent a \"western invasion\". The defiance from Belgrade ran counter to attempts by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to solve the crisis by calling on Mr Milosevic and Vojislav Kostunica, his main rival, to travel to Moscow this week for talks. Mr Putin's attempt at a negotiated settlement followed a meeting of key Kremlin officials on Yugoslavia yesterday after which the Russian president said the mounting tension in Serbia was turning into a threat to European stability. It was not clear whether Mr Milosevic, in particular, would agree to the Russian offer of mediation. His brother Borislav, the Yugoslav ambassador in Moscow, dismissed all talk of mediation in Belgrade which also reacted negatively at the weekend to a Kremlin offer to send the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, to Yugoslavia. But with Moscow shifting from being Mr Milosevic's traditional backer to a more even-handed role in the current stand-off while seeking to be the peace broker, Mr Putin is gambling that he can mediate a peaceful handover of power in Belgrade in what would be a triumphant first big foray into international diplomacy and crisis management. While Mr Putin has recognised that Mr Kostunica won last week's election, according to the German government following a telephone conversation between Mr Putin and Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, yesterday's Putin statement, issued while he was en route to India for a four-day visit, also made a nod to the Milosevic camp by talking of a second round. But in the latest of several signals that the Kremlin is distancing itself from Milosevic and discreetly backing Mr Kostunica, one of Mr Putin's closest aides, Sergei Ivanov, the head of the Kremlin's security council, said Yugoslavia needed a legitimate president recognised by \"the world community\". Greece, an Orthodox country like Russia and Serbia, said it was discussing the possibility of helping to organise a recount of the first-round vote with Russia and France, currently in the European Union chair. The renewed Balkan crisis also featured at talks in Paris yesterday between the French government, Madeleine Albright, the US secretary of state, and top EU foreign policy officials.",

      "body": "<p>As part of the Doctors On Trial season, <strong> Why Doctors Make Mistakes</strong> (Channel 4) inevitably had to detail exactly what those quite horrific errors are. The doctor who was supposed to be administering life-saving drugs to a lymphatic cancer sufferer, actually killed him by injecting the wrong drug into his spine. Another doctor pierced the lining of a patient's lung while trying to find a vein. A nurse only just prevented a woman, who was in hospital because she feared she was infertile, from having her tubes tied. </p> <p>Such stories are the stuff of nightmares and headlines. Now that we have traded dinner tables for campfires, they are our ghost stories, our urban myths. These days, everybody knows somebody who knows somebody who went into hospital to get their tonsils out and was discharged with a vasectomy. </p> <p>While medical errors may not be that epidemic, they might as well be, since every story of misdiagnosis, drug mix-ups or surgeries gone wrong chips away at the faith we have in the medical profession. Although no official figures exist - this being a dirty little secret - there are an estimated 320,000 accidents per year in the UK resulting in 40,000 deaths. In every hospital in the country, patients are dying needlessly. </p> <p>But as terrible and tragic as the stories of malpractice are, there is perhaps a lesson to be learned from them. </p> <p>We want doctors to be infallible, for medicine to be an exact science, for everything to be fine. We want to believe that while we're not immortal, we are, at least, pretty resilient and, in case of emergencies, there are people who can put us back together again. We don't want to know that medicine isn't an exact science, that a lot of it is intelligent guesswork and, as such, has a margin for error. </p> <p>We don't want to admit doctors' fallibility because it means facing our own mortality, the distinct lack of happy endings. Of course doctors make mistakes - and some, like the misadministration of Richie Williams' drugs, are unforgivable - but they do so because they are human. We forget it sometimes, as do they (sometimes to an alarming extent), but the fact remains. </p> <p>It is for that reason programmes like Peak Practice and Casualty are so successful: they are anaesthetics against reality. In Cardale and Holby, doctors are heroic. In the real world, flawless heroes are harder to come by, yet still we have great expectations. As always, there is a pressing need for a re-evaluation of how we appreciate doctors and nurses. If fatigue or lack of time for examining patients are factors in mistakes being made, then those factors need to be tackled. Which is to say, there needs to be more money better spent within the NHS. And who ever voted for higher taxes? You don't get something for nothing. Set your stakes too high, you're bound to lose. </p> <p>When Grunt Mitchell departed Walford, expectations were high for Ross Kemp, and with <strong> Without Motive</strong> (ITV), the ghost of Grunt is closer than ever to being laid to rest. Alas, after In Defence and Hero Of The Hour - and this drama with Kemp as a CID officer investigating a serial killer in Wales and Bristol - what has replaced it is a succession of bland, identikit members of the law-and-order fraternity all of whom are still essentially Kemp in a too-tight suit. </p> <p>Without Motive was a humourless, moribund police procedural drama you could have been forgiven for thinking was the second part of Tough Love, which was on the night before. In that marginally better effort, Ray Winstone's Lenny was a good egg among bad apples, while Kemp's Jack Mowbray was another exemplary egg in the larder of life.

      "bodyText": "As part of the Doctors On Trial season, Why Doctors Make Mistakes (Channel 4) inevitably had to detail exactly what those quite horrific errors are. The doctor who was supposed to be administering life-saving drugs to a lymphatic cancer sufferer, actually killed him by injecting the wrong drug into his spine. Another doctor pierced the lining of a patient's lung while trying to find a vein. A nurse only just prevented a woman, who was in hospital because she feared she was infertile, from having her tubes tied. Such stories are the stuff of nightmares and headlines. Now that we have traded dinner tables for campfires, they are our ghost stories, our urban myths. These days, everybody knows somebody who knows somebody who went into hospital to get their tonsils out and was discharged with a vasectomy. While medical errors may not be that epidemic, they might as well be, since every story of misdiagnosis, drug mix-ups or surgeries gone wrong chips away at the faith we have in the medical profession. Although no official figures exist - this being a dirty little secret - there are an estimated 320,000 accidents per year in the UK resulting in 40,000 deaths. In every hospital in the country, patients are dying needlessly. But as terrible and tragic as the stories of malpractice are, there is perhaps a lesson to be learned from them. We want doctors to be infallible, for medicine to be an exact science, for everything to be fine. We want to believe that while we're not immortal, we are, at least, pretty resilient and, in case of emergencies, there are people who can put us back together again. We don't want to know that medicine isn't an exact science, that a lot of it is intelligent guesswork and, as such, has a margin for error. We don't want to admit doctors' fallibility because it means facing our own mortality, the distinct lack of happy endings. Of course doctors make mistakes - and some, like the misadministration of Richie Williams' drugs, are unforgivable - but they do so because they are human. We forget it sometimes, as do they (sometimes to an alarming extent), but the fact remains. It is for that reason programmes like Peak Practice and Casualty are so successful: they are anaesthetics against reality. In Cardale and Holby, doctors are heroic. In the real world, flawless heroes are harder to come by, yet still we have great expectations. As always, there is a pressing need for a re-evaluation of how we appreciate doctors and nurses. If fatigue or lack of time for examining patients are factors in mistakes being made, then those factors need to be tackled. Which is to say, there needs to be more money better spent within the NHS. And who ever voted for higher taxes? You don't get something for nothing. Set your stakes too high, you're bound to lose. When Grunt Mitchell departed Walford, expectations were high for Ross Kemp, and with Without Motive (ITV), the ghost of Grunt is closer than ever to being laid to rest. Alas, after In Defence and Hero Of The Hour - and this drama with Kemp as a CID officer investigating a serial killer in Wales and Bristol - what has replaced it is a succession of bland, identikit members of the law-and-order fraternity all of whom are still essentially Kemp in a too-tight suit. Without Motive was a humourless, moribund police procedural drama you could have been forgiven for thinking was the second part of Tough Love, which was on the night before. In that marginally better effort, Ray Winstone's Lenny was a good egg among bad apples, while Kemp's Jack Mowbray was another exemplary egg in the larder of life. Both men even had the same wife. Taking longer to get started than a 1981 Ford Fiesta, Without Motive was allegedly about the hunt for a serial killer. With its sub-Seven titles, it might have been a worthy successor to Touching Evil, but it was not to be. The first dead body turned up soon enough, but then, inexplicably, there was a let's-meet-the-policemen interlude which was as dull as it sounds, even if one of them was Welsh and went to Andrew Neil's hairdresser.

Mr Sharon's intention was ostentatiously to assert his belief in a united Jerusalem in the teeth of faltering, last-gasp attempts by Ehud Barak's government to reach some kind of compromise with Yasser Arafat.

Mr Sharon and Mr Netanyahu are to the peace process what a fox is to a chicken coop. In the guise of defending Israel's security, they weaken it.

They are little more than the IT departments of the markets - markets which will always sort themselves, as efficient markets do. </p> <p>Even this newspaper's leader column has stated, quite bluntly, that it no longer matters who owns the London Stock Exchange, for all its 200 years of existence. </p> <p>But now there are disturbing whispers that the LSE's current management, chairman Don Cruickshank and marketing director Martin Wheatley, are taking such opinions literally. </p> <p>They are said to have abandoned any pretence of having a vision for the future. No battle plan is under construction, no energetic display of why this institution should remain independent - or why, in fact, any of the management might deserve to keep their jobs. </p> <p>They assume that, whatever the LSE says or does now, shareholders will just automatically vote down the hostile takeover from Sweden's OM Gruppen. The thinking now is to stop thinking. It is too risky: the LSE cannot whip out a new strategy or alternative merger from the hat since it has not time, under the bid timetable, to get it right. Such a move would lack credibility. </p> <p>Oh, and it might get things wrong again. </p> <p>In any case, it is said, why rush around for a fix when the London equity market is not broken? The technology is fine and we have the biggest pool of captive liquidity in Europe. </p> <p>This is complacent in the extreme. In fact, those who have been briefed on the new non-strategy reckon Mr Cruickshank and his colleagues need some help, and sharpish. So here goes: </p> <p>First the LSE should identify its crucial weaknesses before their competitors point them out. The trading technology is substandard.

      "bodyText": "It has become fashionable to say that exchanges no longer count for much in the modern financial world. They are little more than the IT departments of the markets - markets which will always sort themselves, as efficient markets do. Even this newspaper's leader column has stated, quite bluntly, that it no longer matters who owns the London Stock Exchange, for all its 200 years of existence. But now there are disturbing whispers that the LSE's current management, chairman Don Cruickshank and marketing director Martin Wheatley, are taking such opinions literally. They are said to have abandoned any pretence of having a vision for the future. No battle plan is under construction, no energetic display of why this institution should remain independent - or why, in fact, any of the management might deserve to keep their jobs. They assume that, whatever the LSE says or does now, shareholders will just automatically vote down the hostile takeover from Sweden's OM Gruppen. The thinking now is to stop thinking. It is too risky: the LSE cannot whip out a new strategy or alternative merger from the hat since it has not time, under the bid timetable, to get it right. Such a move would lack credibility. Oh, and it might get things wrong again. In any case, it is said, why rush around for a fix when the London equity market is not broken? The technology is fine and we have the biggest pool of captive liquidity in Europe. This is complacent in the extreme. In fact, those who have been briefed on the new non-strategy reckon Mr Cruickshank and his colleagues need some help, and sharpish. So here goes: First the LSE should identify its crucial weaknesses before their competitors point them out. The trading technology is substandard. Teething problems with the Sets order book have been going on for a short five years. In particular, there have been persistent problems setting credible end-of-day prices for companies of all shapes and sizes. This is fundamental, since the price-setting mechanism is perhaps the single, most important reason for an exchange to exist. Clearing and settlement systems are cumbersome, costly and lack international reach. The LSE might protest that it is no longer responsible for such matters, having been stripped of its role by the Bank of England. But for anyone trading British equities it does matter. The LSE's customers - and, awkwardly, its shareholders - are split into two, broad, opposing camps. Neither feels its needs are being met. The split has been there for 14 years so the LSE should probably stop hoping that if the matter is ignored it will disappear. Next, the LSE needs to identify its key strengths. Its history, time zone and language has enabled the exchange to retail a substantial majority of all European equity trading. Its procedures and rules are well established and well tested, while regulation in London has reached a level of professionalism that is second only to New York. On the whole, market participants here feel they operate in a fair environment. Levels of probity and corporate governance in London are far higher than in any other European centre. Moving forward from here, the LSE needs that vision thing - a view of where the business is headed. There are alternatives to the usual mergers or alliance options, but it first requires the re-telling of the cautionary tale of a newspaper - the Financial Times. Two years ago the paper set out to use the internet to create a global online product with a global brand, FT.com. Stephen Hill, the chief executive, toured Sillicon Valley for advice. The big technology firms all told him one thing: great idea, do not do it yourself. In fact, one firm, Hewlett Packard, offered to fund, build and run the entire infrastruture simply in return for a small cut of future e-commerce revenues. So the FT decided to manage the project itself, contracting out work to specialist firms rather than going for one big partner. The result was a badly designed website, full of technical glitches, which has failed to destroy the competition to boot. FT.com has failed to reflect and distribute the exceptional qualities of the newspaper. A great idea was bungled. So, back to the LSE. It already has a sizeable portion of pan-European business and also has a brand with global potential. It also has a rulebook that is respected, and international - that is, American - standards of disclosure. What the LSE needs is a big, blue-chip technology partner that has a commercial interest - through a stake or a trading toll - in making the business hum. It needs to build an international infrastructure that is efficient and cheap and does everything - for everyone. It needs to promote London's standards as the international benchmark - and it needs to market the hell out of the whole package. Oh, and it also needs a chief executive.",

Three high court judges rejected fresh evidence in support of Clark's claim that her children had died of sudden infant death syndrome (Sids), or \"unascertained death\", stating that there was overwhelming evidence of her guilt at her trial last November. The judges also ruled that despite errors in the way statistics concerning the chances of a family losing two babies to Sids, also known as cot death, were presented at the trial, that did not prejudice the jury in considering its verdict. \"If there had been no error in relation to statistics at the trial, we are satisfied that the jury would still have convicted on each count,\" they said.

The announcement of the sale ends months of speculation about the fate of Scottish Life, which had received final bids from four prospective buyers, thought to include General Electric's financial services arm and Liverpool Victoria. Colchester-based Royal London tried to calm concerns about the impact on jobs in Edinburgh, where Scottish Life is based. It admitted the company's 25 fund managers would need to relocate to the south-east of England. Mike Yardley, the chief executive of Royal London, insisted more jobs would be created in Edinburgh as result of the acquisition. \"Some fund managers may move but the bulk of Scottish Life is offering great service to IFAs [independent financial advisers] who will continue to based in Edinburgh,\" Mr Yardley said. The head office will be based in Colchester, Essex. Mr Yardley said the acquisition was not a sign that Royal London was boosting its size in preparation for a stock market listing. \"Mutuality has worked tremendously well for us and will continue to do so,\" he said. The acquisition continues the consolidation in the mutual life sector, following the \u00a31.8bn acquisition of Scottish Provident by Abbey National and the \"for sale\" sign put on Equitable Life. The deal gives Royal London - which until now has been regarded as player in the door to door sales market - as a way to sell products through the independent financial adviser area. Analysts also believe it will give the combined company a stronger chance of competing in the pensions fund industry, where profit margins are expected to be depressed after the introduction of stakeholder pensions next year. Under the terms of the sale to Royal London, the precise payments to each Scottish Life policyholder will depend on the status of their policy.

The candidate who is drawing the largest and most enthusiastic crowds is lagging far behind in the polls; the only man with a black running mate is the least popular with black voters; and the one promising what most Americans want is barely registering. All are third-party candidates. Ralph Nader, the Green party contender and veteran consumer-rights campaigner, drew a crowd of 10,000 on Sunday to hear him speak in Boston, following hard on the heels of gatherings of 10,000 in Seattle, 12,000 in Minnesota and 10,500 in Portland, Oregon. Not only are these higher figures mustered by either Al Gore of the Democrats or George W Bush of the Republicans, but they are paying customers, shelling out up to $10 (\u00a36.75) a time to hear the Nader message. Despite the enthusiasm with which he is greeted, despite high-profile support from actors Paul Newman and Susan Sarandon, filmmaker Michael Moore, chatshow host Phil Donahue and some union leaders, Mr Nader is still stalled at around 5% in surveys of public opinion. The Gore team's efforts to persuade liberal America that \"a vote for Nader is a vote for Bush\", the decision by groups such as Friends of the Earth to back Mr Gore for the same reasons, and the lack of a chance to debate with the two main candidates on television are seen as some of the reasons for Mr Nader's low profile. But his team says that the big rallies are bringing in thousands of extra activists, most of them from the 51% of the electorate who usually do not vote. Their fund-raising efforts, often through house parties, have yielded $4m (\u00a32.7m), just enough to run some provocative commercials, but a fraction of what the Gore and Bush camps are spending. \"We get lots of people who say, 'thank God Ralph's running',\" said Peter Stair of Nader 2000. \"You could say that to get 5% of the vote would be one of our benchmarks, but this is part of a continuing movement which will go on far beyond the election.\" Paradoxically, the better Mr Gore does, the bigger chance Mr Nader has of winning votes: if the race between the frontrunners is not seen as not close, Mr Nader's natural supporters may feel more free to back him.

Mr Blackwelder has justified the move by saying: \"We're looking at the reality here. Third-party candidates do not get elected to the presidency.\" Michael Moore, the maverick documentary filmmaker who has been a chief Nader cheerleader, rebutted this argument at the Minnesota rally by asking what would have happened if Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks had also decided to accept the status quo in case things got worse. \"A vote for Nader is a political Molotov - throw it into the voting booth,\" said Moore. But if Mr Nader is having problems capturing the magical double-digit support level, his nearest third-party rivals are floundering in his wake. Pat Buchanan, the renegade rightwing Republican who won the Reform party nomination in a messy battle at its Long Beach convention in August, is barely registering 1% in the polls.

Lord Williams said: \"Some Marchioness passengers have described how they saw the dark hull of Bowbelle looming over Marchioness and did not see any lights.\" Lord Williams went on: \"It is difficult to imagine that the collision would have occurred had both vessels kept a good lookout.\" The Marchioness skipper \"should have been all the more careful because he was navigating his vessel along the middle of the river when Bowbelle would also be passing along the middle of the river\". On the Bowbelle the forward lookout was being kept by Mr Blayney, who had received no instructions as to what he was to look out for, or to report. The system relied upon him shouting and although there were three VHS radio sets on Bowbelle at the time of the collision, they were not used. A practice of posting an officer equipped with a VHS set to keep a lookout seemed to have been deliberately discontinued on the Bowbelle from 1987, Lord Williams said. On the Marchioness, the lookout system being kept by the skipper \"could not possibly be regarded as safe\". The pleasure ship had undergone conversion work in the early 1980s which prevented helmsmen from having an all-round view. On whether Captain Henderson could or should have helped Marchioness passengers in the water, Lord Williams asked: \"Why did he not release them [the lifebuoys] straight away? Was it because in the agony of the moment, he overlooked that simple step? Or because his attention was directed at getting his ship safely through Cannon Street bridge?\" The inquiry continues.

      "bodyText": "Has Estelle Morris (Minister says New Labour has learned to like private schools, September 30) given us a true glimpse of New Labour? My abhorrence of the private system has nothing to do with the fact that pupils achieve good results, but rather that these are achieved at the expense of a significant section of society. In comprehensive schools throughout the country, teachers take on the role of counsellor, social worker and mediator, as well as teaching of classes of 30-plus. Middle-class parents flock to private schools because they want their children to mix with the \"right\" children - in other words, children like theirs. New Labour has succumbed to their voting power. Have we lost the ideal that the more able contribute to the wellbeing of those less privileged? How many desperately needed new recruits to the health service, teaching and social services come from private schools?

Her comments came as controversy surrounding the unbundling of the local loop intensified. It emerged that twelve of BT's competitors - including Energis, Colt Telecom and Kingston Communications - have lodged an official complaint with the telecoms regulator against BT as a prelude to possible legal action. Ms Hewitt defended the timetable set out by Oftel which she said will see \"widespread\" alternatives to BT in the local network by next July.

Mr Clinton telephoned the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, on Saturday, and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, the next day. According to Mr Crowley, the president expressed his concern over the course of events, conveyed his condolences to the families of the dead, and called for calm. The secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, and the national security adviser, Sandy Berger, also called officials on both sides of the conflict in an attempt to prevent any further escalation. In Washington, however, there was a growing sense of helplessness and resignation over prospects for a permanent Middle East settlement, a diplomatic coup which the White House had hoped would be Mr Clinton's crowning foreign policy achievement.

Or to keep their old cars and wait and see. </p> <p>Ford said it would cut the listed price for its best-selling car, the Focus 1.6 Zetec, by 11.1% or \u00a31,505 to an on-the-road price of \u00a311,995 and offer a three-year, 60,000-mile warranty for all its new cars, backdated to September 1. </p> <p>Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, who last month implemented measures to close the \u00a31bn-a-year gap between UK and European car prices, hailed Ford's announcement as \"a victory for the consumer\" and forecast that other big manufacturers would follow suit. </p> <p>But Vauxhall, the second biggest car-seller, merely said it would examine Ford's move and insisted its cars remained \"excellent value for money'.' </p> <p>Industry analysts warned that consumers should not expect to see showroom prices come tumbling down immediately. </p> <p>\"It's all smoke and mirrors and I don't expect to see a significant cut in transaction prices [the price a motorist actually pays to a dealer],\" a rival industry insider said. \"Before, dealers used to say, here's the listed price but let's have a chat. Now they'll say, here's the price and that's that.\" </p> <p>Peter Wells, senior research fellow at the motor industry unit at Cardiff business school, agreed. \"Consumers - and dealers - may find they have far less room to manoeuvre. Over the piece consumers may benefit but not necessarily so.\" </p> <p>Paul Everitt, chief economist at the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), said Ford had been the first major player to adjust its RRPs to transaction prices and these, including trade-in and discount, would not change substantially in the coming months. </p> <p>But Alan Pulham, director of the National Franchised Dealers Association, said he expected the gap between British prices and those in continental Europe to narrow significantly. \"Consumers can expect just about all the manufacturers which have not moved to drop their prices and hopefully this will be the once-and-for-all move to bring confidence back to the market-place,\" he said. </p> <p>The reason for the confusion is simple. The government's campaign against high car prices forced manufacturers such as Ford to offer a series of incentives such as cash-back deals, free AA membership and insurance and low rates of interest to win back customers. </p> <p>Average new car prices fell 5.9% in the year to August, according to the Alliance &amp; Leicester index published last week, with prices for nearly new and used cars down 18.2% and 21.7% respectively. But sales to individual consumers, according to Mr Pulham, have fallen around 10%. Ford's market share has dropped from 17.7% in August 1999 to 16.7% in August this year. </p> <p>Ford insiders insisted yesterday that its incentives packages had boosted its market share last month - in SMMT figures due out later this week - to above 18%. But they admitted, too, that yesterday's cut in RRPs might make little difference to the actual price a motorist pays: the basic Ka, with \u00a3500 cash back, cost \u00a36,995 before and now, without cash back, will cost the same on the road. </p> <p>Ian McAllister, Ford's UK chairman, said the key point, however, was that his company's measures brought \"clarity and stability\" for the new car buyer. </p> <p>Consumers welcomed them as creating the greater transparency they had long campaigned for, but industry experts were not so sure. </p> <p>Mr Everitt said the measures, coupled with an optimistic economic outlook as a whole, should boost car sales from this year's expected 2.2m - the same as in 1999, but held up by company sales - by 50,000 to 100,000 next year. </p> <p>But Dr Wells said the prospects were for greater rather than less turbulence in the coming months. </p> <p>One reason is that the government is pressing the European commission to end the so-called block exemption - allowing car manufacturers to sell exclusively to their own franchised dealers - when it runs out in September 2002. Other EU countries, where car prices scarcely rate as a political issue, are not so keen and experts say this will increase uncertainty about future prices. </p> <p>Another source of instability is the fluctuating exchange rate between the pound and the euro. Manufacturers had assumed that the single currency's decline would be a short-term blip but, after 21 months of falling value, they are hesitant and confused. \"Ford's decision to cut its listed price is quite a gamble that the euro will recover,\" one expert said. </p> <p>A final fly in the ointment is that the price cuts, together with expensive new model programmes, will bring a further drop in the profit margins of the big car manufacturers, which are barely able to get 2% on sales. They could squeeze dealers who, in turn, squeeze customers with less attractive packages - and consumers will continue to buy from the web at prices up to \u00a31,500 cheaper, say, for a Ford Focus. </p> <p>Price cuts will also spell further trouble for British components makers as manufacturers try to offset sterling's strength by buying abroad. \"There are big investment decisions pending, at Nissan's Sunderland plant and Peugeot's Ryton factory,\" Mr Everitt said. \"The government may get rock-bottom prices but how many jobs is that worth?\"</p>",

Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, who last month implemented measures to close the \u00a31bn-a-year gap between UK and European car prices, hailed Ford's announcement as \"a victory for the consumer\" and forecast that other big manufacturers would follow suit. But Vauxhall, the second biggest car-seller, merely said it would examine Ford's move and insisted its cars remained \"excellent value for money'.' Industry analysts warned that consumers should not expect to see showroom prices come tumbling down immediately. \"It's all smoke and mirrors and I don't expect to see a significant cut in transaction prices [the price a motorist actually pays to a dealer],\" a rival industry insider said. \"Before, dealers used to say, here's the listed price but let's have a chat. Now they'll say, here's the price and that's that.\" Peter Wells, senior research fellow at the motor industry unit at Cardiff business school, agreed. \"Consumers - and dealers - may find they have far less room to manoeuvre. Over the piece consumers may benefit but not necessarily so.\" Paul Everitt, chief economist at the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), said Ford had been the first major player to adjust its RRPs to transaction prices and these, including trade-in and discount, would not change substantially in the coming months. But Alan Pulham, director of the National Franchised Dealers Association, said he expected the gap between British prices and those in continental Europe to narrow significantly. \"Consumers can expect just about all the manufacturers which have not moved to drop their prices and hopefully this will be the once-and-for-all move to bring confidence back to the market-place,\" he said. The reason for the confusion is simple. The government's campaign against high car prices forced manufacturers such as Ford to offer a series of incentives such as cash-back deals, free AA membership and insurance and low rates of interest to win back customers. Average new car prices fell 5.9% in the year to August, according to the Alliance &amp; Leicester index published last week, with prices for nearly new and used cars down 18.2% and 21.7% respectively. But sales to individual consumers, according to Mr Pulham, have fallen around 10%. Ford's market share has dropped from 17.7% in August 1999 to 16.7% in August this year. Ford insiders insisted yesterday that its incentives packages had boosted its market share last month - in SMMT figures due out later this week - to above 18%. But they admitted, too, that yesterday's cut in RRPs might make little difference to the actual price a motorist pays: the basic Ka, with \u00a3500 cash back, cost \u00a36,995 before and now, without cash back, will cost the same on the road. Ian McAllister, Ford's UK chairman, said the key point, however, was that his company's measures brought \"clarity and stability\" for the new car buyer. Consumers welcomed them as creating the greater transparency they had long campaigned for, but industry experts were not so sure. Mr Everitt said the measures, coupled with an optimistic economic outlook as a whole, should boost car sales from this year's expected 2.2m - the same as in 1999, but held up by company sales - by 50,000 to 100,000 next year. But Dr Wells said the prospects were for greater rather than less turbulence in the coming months. One reason is that the government is pressing the European commission to end the so-called block exemption - allowing car manufacturers to sell exclusively to their own franchised dealers - when it runs out in September 2002. Other EU countries, where car prices scarcely rate as a political issue, are not so keen and experts say this will increase uncertainty about future prices. Another source of instability is the fluctuating exchange rate between the pound and the euro. Manufacturers had assumed that the single currency's decline would be a short-term blip but, after 21 months of falling value, they are hesitant and confused. \"Ford's decision to cut its listed price is quite a gamble that the euro will recover,\" one expert said. A final fly in the ointment is that the price cuts, together with expensive new model programmes, will bring a further drop in the profit margins of the big car manufacturers, which are barely able to get 2% on sales. They could squeeze dealers who, in turn, squeeze customers with less attractive packages - and consumers will continue to buy from the web at prices up to \u00a31,500 cheaper, say, for a Ford Focus. Price cuts will also spell further trouble for British components makers as manufacturers try to offset sterling's strength by buying abroad. \"There are big investment decisions pending, at Nissan's Sunderland plant and Peugeot's Ryton factory,\" Mr Everitt said. \"The government may get rock-bottom prices but how many jobs is that worth?\"",

      "bodyText": "When Ariel Sharon, the bulldozer of Israeli politics, marched up to the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem last Thursday accompanied by hundreds of riot police, he was - as he put it - merely exercising the right of every Jew to visit the holiest site in Judaism. But was it a pilgrimage or a provocation? Yesterday, governments around the world appeared to have little doubt as they heaped condemnation on Israel's hardline opposition leader. The 45 minutes that the former army general - described in an Israeli newspaper as a \"connoisseur of non-kosher foods\" - spent exercising his religious rights sparked five days of bloody violence in which scores of people, mostly Palestinians, have died. Mr Sharon's dramatic gesture appears to have been calculated to embarrass Mr Barak and to reinforce his own position as leader of the Likud party in the face of a likely challenge from the former prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu. Mr Netanyahu's path to a political comeback was cleared last Wednesday when the Israeli attorney general decided not to prosecute him for alleged corruption. Mr Sharon claimed on television that his visit was meant to demonstrate that no Israeli needs ask for permission to visit sovereign Israeli territory. But Israeli governments - including those in which Mr Sharon served - have always been conscious of the sensitivity of the site and have tried to keep Jewish extremists away. One theory advanced by a western diplomatic source yesterday was that Mr Sharon may have expected Israeli security forces to turn him away from the site - which would have allowed him to accuse Mr Barak of surrendering sovereignty over the area. Besides infuriating Palestinians, Mr Sharon's visit appears to have caused offence to pious Jews. An article in Ha'aretz newspaper yesterday accused him of desecrating the holy site by visiting it without taking a ritual bath beforehand or changing into non-leather shoes. Mr Sharon yesterday insisted: \"It was not my visit to the Temple Mount that ignited the disturbances.\" He said the riots were \"part of an overall campaign planned in advance\", which had begun about 10 days ago near Gaza, and had spread to Jerusalem. Several Israeli officials have lent their support to this claim, suggesting that some of the Palestinians - with or without the connivance of their leaders - were looking for an opportunity to cause trouble, and that Mr Sharon provided it. \"Sharon was (in the best case) not the cause of the disturbances but rather a pretext for them,\" an article in Ha'aretz newspaper said yesterday. \"Instead of lighting the fire, he gave the Palestinians the match. The question remains: Why did he do it?\" As far as the international community was concerned, Mr Sharon deserved and received widespread condemnation. In addition to the criticism levelled by individual countries, France, the current holder of the European presidency, issued a statement on behalf of the EU. \"The European Union is very concerned by the continuation of bloody confrontations in Jerusalem and in the territories and dismayed by the number of victims,\" it said. The European Union urges all those responsible on both sides to take all necessary measures to stop the violence and avoid new provocations.\" Meanwhile, the Palestinian observer at the UN protested to the organisation about Mr Sharon's visit and called for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from east Jerusalem and the vicinity of all Palestinian cities. Mr Sharon is regarded by some Israelis as a hero and by others as a super hawk. Almost anything he says or does is liable to inflame Palestinian feelings because of his bloodstained past. Born at Kfar Malal in 1928 to a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 family, he grew up on a cooperative farm in western Palestine under British rule. In 1953 he founded and led the notorious \"Unit 101\" commando unit which carried out retaliatory raids against Arab \"infiltrators\". In one infamous instance, 69 civilians (most of them women and children) were killed by accident in Qibya, a Jordanian village.

In 1982, he masterminded the invasion of Lebanon, sending the Israelis into Beirut to drive out the Palestine Liberation Organisation. In the process, hundreds of Palestinians in refugee camps un der Israeli control were massacred by Lebanese Christian militiamen.

      "bodyText": "Conservative plans to turn the tide in favour of England's cities by creating new private sector led regeneration companies to tear down tower blocks, build new schools, and reclaim derelict sites, have yet to be costed, William Hague admitted yesterday. Unveiled at the start of the 2000 Tory conference yesterday as a sign of a \"bold new social agenda\", they appeared to urban analysts to be a mix of current government initiatives and old programmes which have been widely criticised as often wasteful and ineffective. Among Mr Hague's plans are fresh curbs on greenfield sites in the crowded south-east and fast-track planning permission for \"brownfield\" urban sites in the midlands and north, plus a host of incentives to make decayed inner cities more attractive to ambitious people now heading south. Communities will be able to bring in extra police - paid for from their regeneration budget - and neighbours will be able to trigger the anti-social behaviour orders which Labour introduced against so-called families from hell. The deterrent will result in fewer evictions, not more, Mr Hague predicted. Flanked by senior members of his team the opposition leader promised that a future Tory government would appoint a special regeneration minister, possibly of cabinet rank, to cut through red tape and ensure speedy action across areas from planning, to crime and education. Challenged at his press conference to say where his overall vision of urban renewal differs from the public/private partnership approach of John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, Mr Hague insisted that Labour had \"waffled\" about partnership and cross-departmental \"joined-up government\" in Whitehall, but had not achieved much. His environment spokesman, Archie Norman, said that in three years poverty and crime were up, as were homeless and other indices of urban decay. Even spending on inner city regeneration was down, said the former Asda chief whose revival of the supermarket chain took him into inner city politics. Also drawing heavily on some urban initiatives in the US - but not offering US-style tax breaks - Mr Hague and Ann Widdecombe, the shadowe home secretary, took the populist line of floating \"cops in shops\", with officers operating from shops in communities to lead the fight against crime and be visible as both a deterrent and an reassurance. The police will also be urged to use empty property as bases to stop them being used by gangs. \"I believe we are ready to be a government because we are ready to govern for all the people and that means tackling the problems of our inner cities,\" the Tory leader said. He told his news confer ence in Bournemouth: \"Millions of people live and bring up children in our inner cities.

High levels of unemployment, crime, poor schools, drug problems had also taken over too many areas. \"These social problems are most evident in the vast concrete tower block estates that scar our urban landscape.\" Part of the Tory solution is to create regeneration companies, with a relatively short life-span, which will have powers to buy and sell land, pay grants to developers, and even draw up contracts with local schools, and police, to improve conditions in run-down areas.

At a fringe meeting organised by Conservative Mainstream, a group set up by Michael Heseltine to oppose the drift to the right, Mr Major went out of his way to praise his successor for reaching out to middle Britain more effectively than any other party.

The former prime minister angrily denied reports over the weekend that he was planning to use his last conference appearance as an MP to criticise Mr Hague. However, his remarks about \"people in slums\" was a clear sign of his unease. Mr Major qualified his criticisms by applauding the Tory leadership for its eleventh hour conversion to \"one nation\" Toryism. The words \"mainstream majority\" are the buzzwords of this week's conference in Bournemouth as Mr Hague attempts to appeal to middle of the road voters who were put off by his provocative interventions on asylum seekers and on law and order. Mr Major made clear that he would examine the new raft of policies carefully to ensure they measure up to his one nation beliefs. \"This week there are a range of inclusive policies to be announced,\" Mr Major said. \"I hope they will prove effective to people in every part of the country and from every background. \"We must not allow ourselves to be falsely labelled by our opponents. We are the party that stands for one nation.\" Mr Major received a rapturous reception in Bournemouth yesterday as he entered the main conference hall for the opening ceremony, accompanied by his wife Dame Norma. The Majors were embraced enthusiastically by Mr Hague and his wife Ffion, a year after the Tory leadership attempted to airbrush the former prime minister out of history. In his speech the notoriously sensitive former prime minister showed that he still bore scars from his premiership. \"Certainly some MPs in our party did us great harm,\" Mr Major said in a reference to the likes of Neil Hamilton who associated the party with allegations of sleaze. But he said that it was unfair to \"hang individual misdemeanours around the neck of a political party\" led by the likes of Douglas Hurd, Michael Heseltine and Ken Clarke.

His remarks were designed to echo William Hague's claim that the party had returned to its \"one nation roots\". Mr Ancram admitted that much of the past three years had been gruelling and dark, but he now claimed Tony Blair \"knows for the first time that he can lose and knows for the first time that we can win\". He went on: \"I put no great store by opinion polls. They are snapshots. But these recent snapshots of the past few weeks show if nothing else the mirage that was New Labour has gone and gone forever\". He promised the Conservatives would have answers for pensioners, hard working families, victims of crime and mothers concerned by the quality of their children's education. Mr Ancram predicted the Conservatives would take back 30 of the Liberal Democrats 49 seats, including Romsey, the once safe Tory seat lost in a byelection in May. The claim was undermined yesterday with the news that the chairman of the Romsey Conservative Association, Rod Brayshaw, had resigned in disgust at the local party's decision to select a close Hague aide, rather than a local candidate. It was widely claimed that the Tories lost the byelection due to their failure to select a local candidate. In a hard hitting speech designed to show he will be an effective front man for the party in the coming election, Mr Ancram derided Labour as liars, cynics and incompetents. At the same time he described the Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy as a man who has \"reduced a once great national party to a mere faction within the politics of the left, supine in the face of New Labour and grovelling for political crumbs\". The party chairman had been criticised at the weekend by anonymous rightwingers for lacking the punch of previous Tory chairmen such as Lord Tebbit. Mr Ancram said: \"We come to this conference with our opponents in disarray, their cover blown, their image shattered and their hollowness exposed\". He claimed his party was ready for government, saying: \"This is our chance to show that far from the shores of extremism upon which our opponents seek to place us we are the party of the mainstream, sharing the values of the mainstream majority in this country.\" Mr Acram won his biggest cheers, however, for more traditional attacks - on John Prescott for his contempt of the countryside, and his own promise to fight tooth and nail - like the Danes - to prevent the euro replacing the national currency. He pinpointed the crisis over funding for the dome as the moment when the tide turned against Labour. The later week long fuel crisis had shown all that was wrong with New Labour - \"it showed they don't listen, that the only answer they have is spin and that in a corner they will always try to lie their way out\".",

It was awful.

      "bodyText": "Having trouble tracking down a lover to suit your taste? Look to his plate, rather than into his eyes. According to German psychologist Alfred Gebert, women can tell whether a man is prosciutto or mushy peas by examining the way he eats. The messy eater is a baby at heart. The guzzler wants to try everything and is easily distracted. The man who plays with his food, making gravy canals between sausages and mash, is not the tiresome companion we'd thought, but fun and caring. So now you know. And a few tips of our own. Misses his mouth: lack of basic co-ordination could prove a problem in the sack. Gets familiar with waitress: commitment issues. Cries after too much wine: over. According to new research, the sexes will reach equality in the home by 2015, with each partner doing 70 minutes of housework per day. Equal pay is set for 2035. Is there a deal to be done here? What about the lads making up for those 2035 years of unequal pay by taking on the daily 70 minutes, while women spend the time more usefully, on spurious scientific studies about how the way you scratch your ears affects your sexual performance and the like.",

      "body": "<p>Beams of orange sunlight pierce the sodden gloom of the forest, casting slanting shadows among the tall, mossy trunks. The light falls on a little sandy hollow deep in the trees, a sudden patch of luminous warmth in the sullen grey air. What is this - Country Diary? Harken to the cry of the capercaillie and the distant noise of a blundering elk. Here's an unusual species of lichen. No - the forest is silent and dead, a model on a vitrine, standing on a plinth in Birmingham's Ikon Gallery. The twinkling dewdrops on the branches are air bubbles, the heavy mist in the tank a solution of milky acrylic and salt water. </p> <p>There is something magical and disturbing about Mariele Neudecker's model worlds and, pressing your nose to the glass, you might almost be in that dank forest, alert to every snapping twig. It's just like that Judder Man advert, the Blair Witch Project, Red Riding Hood and every scary folk tale that made you dive under the duvet, squirming in delighted horror. The imagery of the deep dark wood is a staple of our imaginations: think Wind in the Willows, Teddy Bear's Picnic, Twin Peaks and Deliverance. If the wood sprites and witches don't get you, some hillbilly with a squint and a squirrel-gun will. </p> <p>Neudecker's I Don't Know How I Resisted the Urge to Run is like a chapter title for a story you can make up yourself, from the woodpile of received imagery. This may take something away from the magic, but instead it actually adds to it, heaping on the layers. We know where we are, what this is about. All we have to do is supply our own bogeyman: a backwoods serial killer, a bloodthirsty bear, an old lady with a wart on her nose. </p> <p>That's the thing about cliches - one size fits all. The vitrine has become a commonplace, too, if not an artistic cliche: Joseph Beuys's vitrines, with their arrangements of forlorn detritus and potent little objects; Jeff Koons's shiny, hermetically-sealed display cabinets (from the mid-1980s) with their brand-new vacuum cleaners; Damien Hirst's vitrines, the Chapman brothers' Hell, their model inferno in Apocalypse... The vitrine is like a picture frame, a container for another world, itself displayed within the larger box of the gallery. </p> <p>While Hirst's tanks have a sort of overblown sculptural status in their own right, Beuys's glass containers always stayed close to the museum display cabinet, while remaining little theatres of the imagination. Beuys's choice of objects (rusty tin cans, razor blades, grease-stained cardboard boxes, lumps of fat and props from his performances) gave his vitrine works the air of reliquaries. His walking stick was like a bishop's mitre, his hat and fishing vest the priestly vestments of a one-man religion. One would never be surprised, looking into a Beuys vitrine, to find St Agatha's preserved breasts, like shrivelled figs, or the mummified fingers of St Thomas, wrapped in gauze. </p> <p>Looking into Neudecker's vitrines, like looking into the Chapmans' multi-part Hell, is a lot like watching TV; we suspend our sense of our own scale in relation to the model in the tank. This, too, was one of the functions of the otherwise merely unfashionable and ostentatious glazed and gilded frames Francis Bacon used on his paintings. Like the proscenium arch, the frame and the glazed box cue our theatrical suspension of disbelief. Like the picture frame, the vitrine is in fact a device with an old-fashioned purpose: to remove the object under scrutiny from the everyday world, the laws of time and place. It obeys instead another law, that of artistic and museological displacement. </p> <p>Neudecker's work is supremely conscious of this - presenting us with a world at a remove, a kind of wondrous 3D picture. It is, frequently, a picturesque or gothic sublime, often based on an even earlier picture, and often derived from the Romantic paintings of Caspar David Friedrich. She re-creates misty forests, mountainscapes, tumbles of rock and scree, peaks and valleys in miniature. All that's missing is the pondering subject, the figure in the painting to witness the scene and give it its sense of scale, immeasurable distance and magnitude. We wonder, too, at the artifice with which Neudecker creates an illusory geography as much as we do at the meaning of them. Up close to her vitrines, we happily - willingly - choose to forget we are in a nicely-heated art gallery, and imagine ourselves in the forest or high mountain pass with Friedrich, or on a ship at the edge of an ice-floe, with Coleridge's Ancient Mariner. </p> <p>There are several vitrines in Neudecker's solo show at the Ikon. One contains a snowy alpine landscape, a series of high passes, valleys and gorges, with some kind of church or chimney on one mountain, a cross atop the highest peak across the valley. Our own scale seems infinitesimal. Yet another mountainscape is perched above our heads, on a plinth whose high-angled sides resemble Edwin Lutyens's Whitehall Cenotaph. I've never been on an alp, having only ever flown over them - the view is wondrous enough, but always feels somehow undeserved, and therefore a little unreal. </p> <p>The vitrines are Neudecker's best-known works, and a winning formula. But, thankfully, she knows how to go beyond them. Her model of light coming in through a gothic window - the light rendered, as though in an engraving, but executed in hundreds of stretched lengths of nylon monofilament fishing line that fan through the window and down to the floor - is too much a demonstration model to be entirely successful. </p> <p>Her 3D model of the strange anamorphic skull in Holbein's National Gallery painting The Ambassadors - constructed using medical scans, laser technology and computer modelling, and measured from a real skull - is a fascinating, oddly contorted object. It casts a near perfectly proportioned shadow: a clever, rhetorical aside to the debate about the skull in Holbein's painting. </p> <p>Projected on two side-by-side screens, we see two views of the same mountain range. The sound of a dreadful wind howls through the gallery. Clouds pass over the peaks and fill the valleys. In the middle distance, the cross on the peak stands resolute against the weather. The world turns white. As the storm passes, blue sky glimmers over the mountains, a watery turquoise on one screen, a deeper infinite blue on the other. </p> <p>The world regains its colour, but, as the clouds disperse, vague reflections of pillars appear in the sky, till the dry-ice storm encroaches again. Showing us - albeit briefly and sparingly - the mechanics of the illusion doesn't diminish the sense of wonder. Nor is this revelation the point of the piece. I don't know what the point is, exactly, except that it flips us out of the illusion we've so readily accepted, and go on accepting once the weather closes in again on what are, after all, knee-high peaks. </p> <p>The last, and in some ways most beguiling work in the show is, again, filmed. A sunset is projected on one side of a free-hanging screen, a sunrise on the other. The sunset was filmed in the Azores, the sunrise at the southern tip of Australia. Both were shot at the same time, the two film crews linked by satellite phone. The two locations are true antipodes and, as the sun dips below the horizon in the Atlantic, it heaves up over the Pacific. </p> <p>How can this be, we ask ourselves, and is this really true? I take it on trust, as I walk around the screen, passing from approaching night to dawning day, making my own circumnavigation of a mental world. Why, I ask, having read the catalogue notes, was the work filmed over four days? Are these the same simultaneous sunsets and sunrises? Does it matter? Oscar Wilde, if I remember, thought sunsets were vulgar. Rosy-fingered dawns are a kind of cliche, too. The turn of the earth, and its revolution around the sun, is a constant condition rather than an event. </p> <p>Neudecker's Another Day reminds us of the world's true scale in relation to human metaphor, and our need for a sense of beginnings and endings. A sense of wonder is undoubtedly necessary, along with a sense of proportion. </p> <p>Until Now is at the Ikon Gallery, Birmingham (0121-248 0708), till November 12.</p>",

The invalid care allowance is currently \u00a340.40 a week, with a \u00a324.15 addition for carers also responsible for a dependent adult, \u00a39.85 for an eldest child and \u00a311.35 for other children. Mr Darling is expected to say: \"For the first time carers over 65 will be able to claim the invalid care allowance. Those carers without a retirement pension and some on a low rate will be entitled to it, and those on a low income will receive the carer premium.\"",

      "body": "<p>In 1996 a small show opened in a small theatre in the West End of London. Its credentials seemed to guarantee that it would close before the ink dried on the - very mixed - reviews.</p> <p>It was a translation of a contemporary French play of ideas, acted by three middle-aged men on a minimal set with one white prop. It had no sex, no songs, and it was all over in 90 minutes.</p> <p>\"There's no trick, it's a great night out - I think it's that simple,\" the producer, David Pugh, says to a theatre world clamouring to be let in on his secret.</p> <p>The play was Art, and next week it celebrates its fourth anniversary at Wyndhams Theatre. It is an astounding West End run for a straight play, dealing with the destruction of a triangular friendship when one man invests a small fortune on a plain canvas.</p> <p>The play has been a worldwide success, but nothing has touched the London run. Groups of friends come to watch a rare play dealing with male friendship. Groups of acting friends come and apply as a gang to play the parts: Stephen Tomkinson, star of Ballykissangel, came because his friend Neil Pearson, co-star in Drop the Dead Donkey, said he had to see it, and duly appeared in the 14th cast.</p> <p>Art clearly has a winning formula, but nobody - including the author, Yasmina Reza - has been able to duplicate it. Famously, when she accepted the Evening Standard award for best comedy, she said she was puzzled because she thought she had written a tragedy. The awards audience took this as a splendid joke; show insiders say she meant every word of it.</p> <p>John Godber, who also has an armlock on British popular taste with plays like such as Bouncers and Up and Under, claims not to have seen Art. However two years ago, as founder, director and chief playwright for Hull Truck theatre company, he launched a competition to find a new play which \"must be suitable to be performed by four male actors; it should require minimal set; it should be theatrically exciting.\" He is yet to find it.</p> <p>Maggie Smith is among the divas said to be interested in an all-women version. Reza has turned the idea down flat.</p> <p>One notable cast was Patrick Duffy, who played Bobby Ewing of Dallas, Richard Thomas, who was John-Boy in The Waltons, and Paul Freeman. Another is the 16th, due to take over in three weeks: Warren Mitchell, Ken Campbell and John Fortune.</p> <p>The collision of the immortal Alf Garnett with Ken Campbell, notorious for his Roadshow performances in pubs and clubs, which continued into the small hours until the audience whimpered for mercy, and that most dryly British of satirists, John Fortune, could be epic.</p> <p>\"Keeping it going was a sort of joke originally,\" David Pugh said. \"The first cast, Albert Finney, Tom Courtenay and Ken Stott, was so fantastic that everyone said once they're gone you're finished, mate. So the huge challenge was to get a great second cast, and then we just kept doing it.\"</p> <p>He tries to cast friends who will enjoy working together: the planned first cast was Finney, Courtenay and their drinking mate Michael Gambon. By the time Christopher Hampton's classy translation was finished, Gambon was on Broadway. Pugh cast another old friend, Ken Stott, a rock-solid actor who never quite made A-team status. Since Art he has become the rumpled and twitchy policeman star of two BBC series of Vice.</p> <p>Some people come to see the show so often they become familiar faces. Michael King, who has probably seen Art more often than anyone, says it is a different experience every time. He has seen 11 of the casts to date and will be back for the new boys.</p> <p>Stars are now queueing up to appear in Pugh's show. The actors who play Frasier and his neurotic brother and cranky father in the US sitcom have been struggling for two years to clear a gap in their schedules to appear in Art.</p> <p>It was the first play the lugubrious comedian Jack Dee appeared in, and he came back for a second run. It was the West End debut of fellow comedian Frank Skinner, and the return to ensemble acting of the matinee star Nigel Havers.</p> <p>It has given instant straight acting credentials to other comedians, including Chris Langham and the current stars Sean Hughes and Alistair McGowan (the third is Colin Buchanan).</p> <p>It has also provided a quick burst of West End popular adulation to regiments of former Hamlets, Romeos and Richards from the Royal Shakespeare and National Theatres, including Anton Lesser and Roger Allam.</p> <p>Every actor gets paid \u00a33,000 a week, good money for some of the younger actors, petty cash for the megastars such as Stacy Keach, and less than Jack Dee would get for a 20-minute after dinner speech.</p> <p>Pugh's running wish list is scribbled on a blackboard, originally owned by his father, a Stoke-on-Trent schoolmaster. Current top of the blackboard is Ardal O'Hanlan, though his obvious running mate, Dermot Morgan, Father Ted himself, has died.</p> <p>Pugh is enthusiastic about the casting opportunities promised by the US actors' strike, which may virtually shut down film and TV drama production early next year.</p> <p>There is one obvious name that has never appeared on Pugh's blackboard, a bankable British megastar who might hanker for a brief return to his theatrical roots. Sean Connery is not available. He is, however, the show's co-producer.</p> <p>It was his wife, Micheline, who saw the show in Paris and, convinced there was a part for him, persuaded him to buy the overseas rights.

      "bodyText": "In 1996 a small show opened in a small theatre in the West End of London. Its credentials seemed to guarantee that it would close before the ink dried on the - very mixed - reviews. It was a translation of a contemporary French play of ideas, acted by three middle-aged men on a minimal set with one white prop. It had no sex, no songs, and it was all over in 90 minutes. \"There's no trick, it's a great night out - I think it's that simple,\" the producer, David Pugh, says to a theatre world clamouring to be let in on his secret. The play was Art, and next week it celebrates its fourth anniversary at Wyndhams Theatre. It is an astounding West End run for a straight play, dealing with the destruction of a triangular friendship when one man invests a small fortune on a plain canvas. The play has been a worldwide success, but nothing has touched the London run. Groups of friends come to watch a rare play dealing with male friendship. Groups of acting friends come and apply as a gang to play the parts: Stephen Tomkinson, star of Ballykissangel, came because his friend Neil Pearson, co-star in Drop the Dead Donkey, said he had to see it, and duly appeared in the 14th cast. Art clearly has a winning formula, but nobody - including the author, Yasmina Reza - has been able to duplicate it. Famously, when she accepted the Evening Standard award for best comedy, she said she was puzzled because she thought she had written a tragedy. The awards audience took this as a splendid joke; show insiders say she meant every word of it. John Godber, who also has an armlock on British popular taste with plays like such as Bouncers and Up and Under, claims not to have seen Art. However two years ago, as founder, director and chief playwright for Hull Truck theatre company, he launched a competition to find a new play which \"must be suitable to be performed by four male actors; it should require minimal set; it should be theatrically exciting.\" He is yet to find it. Maggie Smith is among the divas said to be interested in an all-women version. Reza has turned the idea down flat. One notable cast was Patrick Duffy, who played Bobby Ewing of Dallas, Richard Thomas, who was John-Boy in The Waltons, and Paul Freeman. Another is the 16th, due to take over in three weeks: Warren Mitchell, Ken Campbell and John Fortune. The collision of the immortal Alf Garnett with Ken Campbell, notorious for his Roadshow performances in pubs and clubs, which continued into the small hours until the audience whimpered for mercy, and that most dryly British of satirists, John Fortune, could be epic. \"Keeping it going was a sort of joke originally,\" David Pugh said. \"The first cast, Albert Finney, Tom Courtenay and Ken Stott, was so fantastic that everyone said once they're gone you're finished, mate. So the huge challenge was to get a great second cast, and then we just kept doing it.\" He tries to cast friends who will enjoy working together: the planned first cast was Finney, Courtenay and their drinking mate Michael Gambon. By the time Christopher Hampton's classy translation was finished, Gambon was on Broadway. Pugh cast another old friend, Ken Stott, a rock-solid actor who never quite made A-team status. Since Art he has become the rumpled and twitchy policeman star of two BBC series of Vice. Some people come to see the show so often they become familiar faces. Michael King, who has probably seen Art more often than anyone, says it is a different experience every time. He has seen 11 of the casts to date and will be back for the new boys. Stars are now queueing up to appear in Pugh's show. The actors who play Frasier and his neurotic brother and cranky father in the US sitcom have been struggling for two years to clear a gap in their schedules to appear in Art. It was the first play the lugubrious comedian Jack Dee appeared in, and he came back for a second run. It was the West End debut of fellow comedian Frank Skinner, and the return to ensemble acting of the matinee star Nigel Havers. It has given instant straight acting credentials to other comedians, including Chris Langham and the current stars Sean Hughes and Alistair McGowan (the third is Colin Buchanan). It has also provided a quick burst of West End popular adulation to regiments of former Hamlets, Romeos and Richards from the Royal Shakespeare and National Theatres, including Anton Lesser and Roger Allam. Every actor gets paid \u00a33,000 a week, good money for some of the younger actors, petty cash for the megastars such as Stacy Keach, and less than Jack Dee would get for a 20-minute after dinner speech. Pugh's running wish list is scribbled on a blackboard, originally owned by his father, a Stoke-on-Trent schoolmaster. Current top of the blackboard is Ardal O'Hanlan, though his obvious running mate, Dermot Morgan, Father Ted himself, has died. Pugh is enthusiastic about the casting opportunities promised by the US actors' strike, which may virtually shut down film and TV drama production early next year. There is one obvious name that has never appeared on Pugh's blackboard, a bankable British megastar who might hanker for a brief return to his theatrical roots. Sean Connery is not available. He is, however, the show's co-producer. It was his wife, Micheline, who saw the show in Paris and, convinced there was a part for him, persuaded him to buy the overseas rights. He decided not to take a role - he is very much a star who prefers to shine alone rather than in a constellation - but it has proved a remarkably canny investment. Who has been who in the Art world \u0095 Richard Thomas starred as Yvan from April 25 to July 16 2000. Best remembered as John-Boy in The Waltons, he left that show after five years in 1975, returning briefly for A Walton Wedding in 1995.

      "body": "<p>Pat Pottle, the veteran anti-war campaigner who has died aged 62, will be remembered most for helping the Soviet spy George Blake to escape from prison in 1966, in one of the most astonishing jailbreaks in British history.</p> <p>For years it was put about by an embarrassed security establishment that Blake's escape had been the result of a cunning plot engineered by the KGB. Indeed, so humiliating was the escapade that the security services took no action, even when they suspected, only weeks after the event, that it was the work of Pottle, his fellow campaigner Michael Randle, and a petty Irish criminal, Sean Bourke.</p> <p>The special branch advised MI5 that a prosecution might amount to persecution - a big fish had got away, so they were taking it out on the little fish. Even after the two men acknowledged their role in a book in 1989, the authorities were reluctant to pursue them. However, political pressure finally led to them being charged with aiding the escape, and, in 1991, they were tried at the Old Bailey, where, 30 years earlier, Blake himself had been sent to prison for 42 years, a sentence of unprecedented length.</p> <p>Throughout their trial, Pottle and Randle insisted that their action was morally justified, and, ignoring a clear direction from the judge to convict, the jury unanimously acquitted them. For Pottle, the verdict was the climax of decades of non-violent direct action, motivated by humanitarian considerations tinged with an anarchic streak. He believed that while it was responsible for cock-ups as much as conspiracies, all authority was, in the end, corrupting.</p> <p>Pottle was born in Maida Vale, London, one of the five sons (including his twin) of an Irish Catholic mother. His cockney Protestant father was a trade union official, and a socialist. He attended the village school in Garsington, near Oxford, where his father worked for Morris Motors, and, when the family moved to a council flat in Paddington, the Pottle boys went to local schools. Pat's mother wanted them to take up apprenticeships to learn specific skills; Pat went to the London College of Printing.</p> <p>During national service, he worked in the hospital at RAF Uxbridge, and organised his first anti-war demonstration in 1959. He subsequently succeeded Randle as secretary to the Committee of 100, the direct action group which broke away from CND. He participated in a number of demonstrations, including a sit-in at the Soviet embassy in London.</p> <p>In 1961, Pottle defended himself against charges under the Official Secrets Act after organising a sit-in at the US air force base at Wethersfield, Essex. Transcripts of the trial include the following exchange between the trial judge, Mr Justice Havers, and the chief prosecution witness.</p> <p>Pottle: \"Air Commodore, do you agree with this statement: 'We must not forget that by creating atomic bases in East Anglia we have made ourselves the target and perhaps the bullseye of a Soviet attack'?\"</p> <p>Havers: \"Don't answer that. I rule it out.\" Pottle: \"That was a statement of Sir Winston Churchill.\"</p> <p>Pottle and Randle, one of five other defendants, were jailed for 18 months, and it was while in Wormwood Scrubs that they met George Blake.</p> <p>Following his release from jail, Pottle became secretary to the philosopher and disarmament campaigner, Bertrand Russell. In 1964, he was tried and deported from China for \"inciting the Chinese people to overthrow the state\". Later that year, he was deported from Greece after joining anti-nuclear demonstrations. Shortly afterwards, he was deported from Malta after organising an anti-nuclear demonstration there.</p> <p>In 1967, he co-founded the Vietnam Information Group to help US deserters and draft dodgers reach Sweden. A year later, he was arrested in London while demonstrating against the Greek colonels' coup, but escaped from a police van after noticing that the back doors were unlocked. He also organised demonstrations against the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia.</p> <p>In 1969, Pottle decided to move his young family to north Wales for some peace and quiet. There, he developed his interest in antiques, and ran the Pottle Press, mainly printing leaflets for the peace movement and non-government organisations. Ten years later, they returned to London.</p> <p>It was not, however, until 1989 that Pottle and Randle decided to set straight the record of their role in the Blake affair, following a whispering campaign against them prompted by a book on the Soviet spy by Montgomery Hyde. \"We didn't want needlessly to invite prosecution, but there were stories naming others who weren't involved, accusing us of being communist agents, trying to discredit the anti-nuclear campaign,\" Pottle said at the time.</p> <p>In their own book, The Blake Escape, the pair described the ease with which they had helped the Soviet spy scale the prison wall with a rope ladder, and how he was hidden in various north London flats as a massive police hunt was mounted. In the end, Randle and his family had smuggled Blake to East Germany hidden under a bunk in their camper van.</p> <p>The narrative had its moments of black humour. One day, the wife of one of the people harbouring Blake went for a regular visit to her psychiatrist. She told him the Soviet spy was in her house. The psychiatrist replied that she was deluding herself, and had seen too much of Blake on television. She was told to take more pills.</p> <p>Pat Pottle will be remembered for his generosity, warmth and humanity, and as a brilliant raconteur. Last summer, he and his wife, Sue, bought a house in Harlech, north Wales, with the intention of dabbling in antiques and offering bed and breakfast.</p> <p>He is survived by Sue and their two sons, Casper and Julian.</p> <p>\u0095 Patrick Brian Pottle, anti-war campaigner, born August 8 1938; died October 1 2000</p> <p>The following are extracts from Pat Pottle's address to the jury before his acquittal on June 26 1991</p> <p>This prosecution has come about because 110 MPs signed a motion calling for our prosecution, and because of a threat of a private prosecution from the inaptly named Freedom Association . . .</p> <p>Your task would be a lot easier if this were a simple case of guilt or innocence, but it is not. It is a case of right and wrong. It is a case of politics, a case of how governments lie, cheat and manipulate, and then cover their tracks in a smokescreen of official secrecy . . .</p> <p>This is a political trial. A political decision was taken in 1970 not to prosecute. When we were publicly named in 1987, it came as no surprise to the police: they had known since 1970 . . .</p> <p>The accepted theory about George's escape was that it was organised and carried out by agents at the KGB. That was embarrassing to British intelligence, but at least they could argue that the KGB was a worldwide organisation with limitless resources. What would the revelation that a petty criminal and two peace activists had carried out the escape do to our relations with our allies? It was better that the world continued to believe that the whole thing was organised by the KGB rather than the Lavender Hill Mob.</p> <p>The judge has ruled our reasons for freeing George to be irrelevant . . . I disagree with the judge. The idea of a jury system is that you can look at the whole case, not just the legal mumbo-jumbo. You are 12 independent people. Unlike most judges you exist in the ordinary world of everyday life . . . Common sense must tell you that our reasons for helping to free George from prison must be relevant . . .</p> <p>The moral indignation about George's work for the Russians is something I completely agree with. But moral outrage is only genuine when applied to both sides. Have our values become so perverted that we only claim moral outrage at the other side's activities and not our own?</p> <p>What George did for British intelligence and the KGB was wrong - we have never tried to justify it nor whitewash it. But espionage is a dirty business, where rumour becomes fact and fact becomes fiction. The individuals involved in it are exploiters and in turn exploited. Even when caught they can still be used as international pawns in a game, some to be swapped, some to be given immunity, and the unlucky ones left to rot in prison. No one who supports this kind of thing can hold their heads up high.</p> <p>What did George do that sets him apart from other spies uncovered at that time? He was not really British, was he? Not of the old school, not one of us. Deep down, he was a foreigner, and half-Jewish to boot. He was never part of that privileged undergraduate set at Cambridge in the 1930s. Not like dear old Kim [Philby] . . . or dear old Anthony [Blunt] . . .</p> <p>A secret trial, a vicious sentence of 42 years, a secret appeal - is this democracy in action? Is this open justice? Are we not becoming the very thing we condemn?</p> <p>George was no threat to you, me, or our children. He had been caught spying for the Russians, just as they had caught people spying for the west. His usefulness was over, his spying activities at an end. What purpose was served by giving him such a sentence? . . .</p> <p>When the government and its judges allow themselves to be dictated to by mob hysteria, you end up with a society whose laws and penal institutions are based on revenge and nothing else.</p> <p>In the end it comes down to this: a fellow human being asked for help. That help meant breaking the law. I feel no shame in having done so, but I would have felt great shame had I turned down George's request for help.</p> <p>Yes, I helped George Blake escape. I did it for purely humanitarian reasons. I think we were right to do so. I would do it again. I have no apologies to make and no regrets. I will finish by quoting Bertrand Russell: 'Remember your humanity; forget the rest.'</p>",

The judge has ruled our reasons for freeing George to be irrelevant . . . I disagree with the judge. The idea of a jury system is that you can look at the whole case, not just the legal mumbo-jumbo. You are 12 independent people. Unlike most judges you exist in the ordinary world of everyday life . . . Common sense must tell you that our reasons for helping to free George from prison must be relevant . . . The moral indignation about George's work for the Russians is something I completely agree with. But moral outrage is only genuine when applied to both sides. Have our values become so perverted that we only claim moral outrage at the other side's activities and not our own? What George did for British intelligence and the KGB was wrong - we have never tried to justify it nor whitewash it. But espionage is a dirty business, where rumour becomes fact and fact becomes fiction. The individuals involved in it are exploiters and in turn exploited. Even when caught they can still be used as international pawns in a game, some to be swapped, some to be given immunity, and the unlucky ones left to rot in prison. No one who supports this kind of thing can hold their heads up high. What did George do that sets him apart from other spies uncovered at that time? He was not really British, was he? Not of the old school, not one of us. Deep down, he was a foreigner, and half-Jewish to boot. He was never part of that privileged undergraduate set at Cambridge in the 1930s. Not like dear old Kim [Philby] . . . or dear old Anthony [Blunt] . . . A secret trial, a vicious sentence of 42 years, a secret appeal - is this democracy in action? Is this open justice? Are we not becoming the very thing we condemn? George was no threat to you, me, or our children. He had been caught spying for the Russians, just as they had caught people spying for the west. His usefulness was over, his spying activities at an end. What purpose was served by giving him such a sentence? . . . When the government and its judges allow themselves to be dictated to by mob hysteria, you end up with a society whose laws and penal institutions are based on revenge and nothing else. In the end it comes down to this: a fellow human being asked for help. That help meant breaking the law. I feel no shame in having done so, but I would have felt great shame had I turned down George's request for help. Yes, I helped George Blake escape. I did it for purely humanitarian reasons. I think we were right to do so. I would do it again. I have no apologies to make and no regrets. I will finish by quoting Bertrand Russell: 'Remember your humanity; forget the rest.'",

The policy, approved by Swiss voters in 1998 but criticised by international drug enforcement bodies, also involves tougher prevention measures, comprehensive social support for addicts and a police clampdown on heroin users as well as dealers. As many as 937 addicts were on record as following this heroin regime last December. The federal health authorities said this system had improved the social conditions and overall health of about two-thirds of those treated for two years, and brought their drug habit under control. Deaths from heroin overdoses have also been declining in recent years, according to official figures, but there has been a surge in the consumption of cocaine and synthetic drugs such as ecstasy. Swiss police and justice officials have said they fear \"drugs tourism\" if soft drugs are legalised, especially if the country is out of step with its neighbours. The new legislation on cannabis is likely to include a minimum age of 16 or 18 years, and reinforced penalties for dealers and anyone who \"incites consumption\". But cannabis would, in effect, be put on an equivalent footing to alcohol and cigarettes. \"We also need prevention measures because, quite frankly, we don't want young people to take up cannabis,\" Suzanne Auer, a spokeswoman for the Swiss interior ministry said.

The killings, in townships near Johannesburg, aimed to destabilise the African National Congress during the talks in the early 1990s. The most notorious massacre was eight years ago, when 39 people were slaughtered in their homes in the middle of the night at Boipatong, south of Johannesburg. Barnard said that a few days before these killings he was told that guns were to be given to Zulus in the local hostel for an attack on the ANC.

The ANC, which had already put negotiations on hold to protest at the government's complicity in the mounting violence, considered calling off the talks altogether. But that would play into the hands of the killers, it decided, and Boipatong eventually made the ANC more determined to make the negotiations succeed. Government members from the early 1990s have consistently denied that the security forces had any hand in the massacre, but Barnard's testimony will reinforce the widely held belief in South Africa that a \"third force\" played a big role in such killings. He is seeking amnesty for a number of crimes, including the 1989 murder of a prominent academic and human rights activist, David Webster, whom he confesses to killing, and for hanging the foetus of a baboon outside the home of Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Barnard worked for at least two hit squads, the infamous \"civil cooperation bureau\" and the army's \"directorate of covert collections\". Yesterday he also told the commission that the apartheid army had recruited criminals to disrupt ANC rallies in the run-up to the first free election in 1994. \"These things I personally arranged. These were paid out of state funds,\" he said. During a break in yesterday's testimony, the transport minister, Dullah Omar, shook hands with Barnard, who came close to murdering him in 1989.

Mr Hue, whose party has 38 MPs in the national assembly and is a member of the ruling coalition, has denied all charges of influence-peddling and insists that the communists have only ever been funded by membership fees, MPs' salaries and sales of lily-of-the-valley on May Day. \"Some people would like to mix up the scandals now under way with the charges against us today,\" he said. \"We will show that the charges against the French Communist party are without foundation.\" The prosecution alleges that between 1990 and 1994, after the introduction of legislation that was supposed to end slush funds and kickbacks, a consultancy firm that advised mainly communist-run councils accepted \u00a32m from Compagnie Generale des Eaux (CGE) - as Vivendi was then known - in return for recommending that the company be awarded water supply and waste management contracts.

The benchmark index had been slightly ahead for most of the day but any gains were wiped out by the closing price auctions. </p> <p><strong> AstraZeneca</strong> and <strong> Glaxo Wellcome</strong> were to blame for a combined 13 point loss as the session ended 9.7 points down at 6,384.5. </p> <p>It was a disappointing end to a day which had shown signs that the market was prepared to look past the recent raft of profit warnings and high oil prices. </p> <p>The initial hours of trading had seen computer-related stocks flying high, along with those in the oil, telecoms and banking sectors. Volume was at a fairly brisk 1.3bn as the session drew to a close. </p> <p>Software company CMG, one of the day's early chargers, maintained momentum to storm up 106p to \u00a314.15 at last night's close. Rival <strong> Logica</strong> also enjoyed a 5% rise to take it up 110p at \u00a323.35. </p> <p>Shares in Israeli technology firm, <strong> GEO Interactive</strong>, climbed 87.5p to \u00a313.10 after signing a deal with <strong> Lucent Technologies</strong>, the world's largest telecoms maker, to sell enhanced video services. </p> <p><strong> BP Amoco</strong> and <strong> Shell</strong> were both lifted on the back of fresh tensions between Iraq and Kuwait. The oil companies rose 3p to 605p and 6p to 557p respectively. </p> <p>Trading in the shares of the leading supermarket chains was also mixed ahead of a competition commission report on the industry. </p> <p><strong>Tesco</strong>, which announced a raft of price cuts totalling \u00a355m, fell 4.5p to 244p, while rival <strong> J Sainsbury</strong> saw 0.25p shaved off its stock price to end the day at 372.75p. </p> <p>Banks also had an unstable time. <strong> Barclays</strong>, which hit highs of \u00a319.11 during the day, fell victim to profit taking and slipped 24p to \u00a318.48. <strong> Lloyds TSB</strong>, however, proved it was still in favour with a 6p rise to 637p. </p> <p>After being beaten by Premier League rivals Arsenal in Sunday's match, <strong> Manchester United</strong> revealed it had been having a rough ride in the boardroom. </p> <p>The club announced a 25% profits slide because of soaring player costs, the controversial decision not to compete in last year's FA Cup competition and an early exit from the European Cup. </p> <p>Adding to the disappointment, the widely-expected \u00a3300m kit deal with Nike was not confirmed, although an announcement is expected soon. As a result, the stock sank 8.75p to 267.25p. </p> <p>Menswear retailer <strong> Moss Bros</strong> added to the gloom after announcing it had suffered from the fashion for dressing down at work. It reported a \u00a34.2m first half loss - excluding the \u00a312m restructuring costs - and suspended its dividend payout. Shares were down 5.5p at 25.5p, a drop of 17.7%, as a result. </p> <p>Also reporting was <strong> HIT Entertainment</strong>, a children's character rights owner, which had a 17.5p rise to 452.5p after reporting strong growth. </p> <p>On the downside, <strong> Marconi</strong> was a stock having a poor day, shedding 20p to 905p despite announcing a two year contract with <strong> Telecom Italia</strong>, worth \u00a3140m. </p> <p>And construction group <strong> Boustead</strong> saw its shares suspended at 7.5p because of a delay in its annual report. </p> <p> <strong> BT</strong> enjoyed a 15.5p rise after a day spent continuing to quash rumours that its chairman, Sir Iain Vallance, will step down a year early. </p> <p>The stock price sunk to 703p at one stage, its lowest for two years, before it recovered to close at 726.5p. </p> <p>Ongoing speculation over the future of <strong> Perpetual</strong> lifted the fund management group 212.5p to \u00a341.00. Weekend reports had suggested that <strong> CGNU</strong>, Britain's biggest insurance group, was in advanced talks over a \u00a31.3bn bid. CGNU was said to have made an informal approach in the past month. </p> <p>Elsewhere, the techMARK 100 added 1.3% to end at 3,782 points, while the FTSE 250 gained 21 points to 6,698. Wall Street's Dow Jones industrial index was 58 points higher as London closed.</p>",

The initial hours of trading had seen computer-related stocks flying high, along with those in the oil, telecoms and banking sectors. Volume was at a fairly brisk 1.3bn as the session drew to a close. Software company CMG, one of the day's early chargers, maintained momentum to storm up 106p to \u00a314.15 at last night's close. Rival Logica also enjoyed a 5% rise to take it up 110p at \u00a323.35. Shares in Israeli technology firm, GEO Interactive, climbed 87.5p to \u00a313.10 after signing a deal with Lucent Technologies, the world's largest telecoms maker, to sell enhanced video services. BP Amoco and Shell were both lifted on the back of fresh tensions between Iraq and Kuwait. The oil companies rose 3p to 605p and 6p to 557p respectively. Trading in the shares of the leading supermarket chains was also mixed ahead of a competition commission report on the industry. Tesco, which announced a raft of price cuts totalling \u00a355m, fell 4.5p to 244p, while rival J Sainsbury saw 0.25p shaved off its stock price to end the day at 372.75p. Banks also had an unstable time. Barclays, which hit highs of \u00a319.11 during the day, fell victim to profit taking and slipped 24p to \u00a318.48. Lloyds TSB, however, proved it was still in favour with a 6p rise to 637p. After being beaten by Premier League rivals Arsenal in Sunday's match, Manchester United revealed it had been having a rough ride in the boardroom. The club announced a 25% profits slide because of soaring player costs, the controversial decision not to compete in last year's FA Cup competition and an early exit from the European Cup. Adding to the disappointment, the widely-expected \u00a3300m kit deal with Nike was not confirmed, although an announcement is expected soon. As a result, the stock sank 8.75p to 267.25p. Menswear retailer Moss Bros added to the gloom after announcing it had suffered from the fashion for dressing down at work. It reported a \u00a34.2m first half loss - excluding the \u00a312m restructuring costs - and suspended its dividend payout. Shares were down 5.5p at 25.5p, a drop of 17.7%, as a result. Also reporting was HIT Entertainment, a children's character rights owner, which had a 17.5p rise to 452.5p after reporting strong growth. On the downside, Marconi was a stock having a poor day, shedding 20p to 905p despite announcing a two year contract with Telecom Italia, worth \u00a3140m. And construction group Boustead saw its shares suspended at 7.5p because of a delay in its annual report. BT enjoyed a 15.5p rise after a day spent continuing to quash rumours that its chairman, Sir Iain Vallance, will step down a year early. The stock price sunk to 703p at one stage, its lowest for two years, before it recovered to close at 726.5p. Ongoing speculation over the future of Perpetual lifted the fund management group 212.5p to \u00a341.00. Weekend reports had suggested that CGNU, Britain's biggest insurance group, was in advanced talks over a \u00a31.3bn bid. CGNU was said to have made an informal approach in the past month. Elsewhere, the techMARK 100 added 1.3% to end at 3,782 points, while the FTSE 250 gained 21 points to 6,698. Wall Street's Dow Jones industrial index was 58 points higher as London closed.",
