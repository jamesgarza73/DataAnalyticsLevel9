After a weekend of merrymaking by Nationwide clubs at the expense of their perceived better, First Division Blackburn Rovers paid a predictably high price for the inhospitable welcome afforded to an old friend. Alan Shearer continues to pen his own colourful scripts and as a finally-balanced fifth-round tie neared its climax he it was who steered home a cross by the substitute Didier Domi at the far post, his second goal of the evening. Newcastle's reward is an unenviable trip to the Worthington Cup finalists Tranmere Rovers. Invigorating and rejuvenating though the arrival of Bobby Robson on Tyneside may have proved to be, Newcastle do still find somewhat less than appealing the prospect of moving beyond the confines of the north-east. If this fondness for home comforts is both familiar and understandable, travel sickness, in its countless guises, can prove to be a side's nemesis, an unpalatable truth to which Robson had referred before last night's game. Rather sadly for Blackburn, the hamstring injury which had been troubling Duncan Ferguson in the previous few days was deemed insufficiently serious to warrant an evening off and he was invited to inflict punishment upon a defence which, many would argue, does suffer from soft-centre syndrome. Indeed, it is fair to say that both these teams attack better than they defend something which provided a formula for an intriguing, at times intoxicating, blend of cavalier counter-thrusts and, of course, schoolboy errors deep inside the penalty area. The game always flowed nicely enough, Newcastle seeking to pick out Ferguson's highly productive forehead at every opportunity, Blackburn threading passes through a back-line which never once looked truly at ease with itself. Predictably, the evening's first chance of any real merit fell to Shearer, jeered from first whistle to last by those who once would have had statutes erected in his honour on every corner of every Blackburn street. Rising smartly at the far post Shearer reached first Alessandro Pistone's free-kick but his header was wayward and lacked power. Blackburn's riposte was swift, Simon Grayson swinging over a fine cross from the right only for Nathan Blake to head tamely into the arms of the Newcastle goalkeeper Steve Harper. Many of the Lancastrians were still chuckling at Shearer's profligacy when he was presented with, and duly converted, his second chance of the tie.

      "body": "<p>Steve Claridge and five of his Portsmouth team-mates face a Football Association inquiry after placing a \u00a3250 bet on their side to beat Barnsley at Fratton Park on Saturday. </p> <p>Claridge, a renowned gambler whose habit has cost him around \u00a3300,000, said he felt insulted by the 3-1 odds offered by the club's official bookmaker Flutters. He promptly scored a hat-trick to ensure Pompey's first win in 15 games and a \u00a3750 pay-out. </p> <p>Betting of any kind by players on football is forbidden. But Claridge said: \"I didn't know we had done anything wrong; we were all backing ourselves to win the game. </p> <p>\"It was just a bit of fun and there was nothing sinister or underhand in it at all. We made a bit of money but we're not going to be able to retire on it. Let's not turn this into something it's not.\" </p> <p>Flutters ran out of money at Fratton Park after the 3-0 victory and were still paying out yesterday. </p> <p>The FA spokesman Steve Double said: \"Nobody connected directly with the game is permitted to bet on football, full stop. That means players, managers and coaching staff. They cannot bet on their own games or on others. We will be making enquiries about this later this week and we will be speaking to Steve Claridge.\" </p> <p>The FA wrote to the Spurs defender John Scales in 1997 to remind him of the rules after he told on television of how he had won \u00a3800 on a game. </p> <p>Scales said he and some of his Wimbledon team-mates backed him to score the first goal in an FA Cup match against Sunderland in 1994. \"It was typical of what we used to do at Wimbledon,\" he said. </p> <p>\u0095 Leicester's midfielder Muzzy Izzet intends to turn his back on a career with England and play for Turkey in this summer's European Championship after being repeatedly overlooked by Kevin Keegan. </p> <p>Izzet has established himself as one of the Premiership's most impressive players but has had no direct contact with Keegan despite the Leicester manager Martin O'Neill orchestrating a vigorous campaign on the player's behalf. </p> <p>Born in south London, Izzet qualifies for Turkey through his father Mehmet and the 25-year-old has been offered a provisional place in Euro 2000 by the national manager Mustafa Denizli. </p> <p>\"I've spent the last few months wrestling with the biggest decision of my life,\" said Izzet. \"I've turned down Turkey twice before and if I said no again it might have been my last chance of international football.

      "bodyText": "Steve Claridge and five of his Portsmouth team-mates face a Football Association inquiry after placing a \u00a3250 bet on their side to beat Barnsley at Fratton Park on Saturday. Claridge, a renowned gambler whose habit has cost him around \u00a3300,000, said he felt insulted by the 3-1 odds offered by the club's official bookmaker Flutters. He promptly scored a hat-trick to ensure Pompey's first win in 15 games and a \u00a3750 pay-out. Betting of any kind by players on football is forbidden. But Claridge said: \"I didn't know we had done anything wrong; we were all backing ourselves to win the game. \"It was just a bit of fun and there was nothing sinister or underhand in it at all. We made a bit of money but we're not going to be able to retire on it. Let's not turn this into something it's not.\" Flutters ran out of money at Fratton Park after the 3-0 victory and were still paying out yesterday. The FA spokesman Steve Double said: \"Nobody connected directly with the game is permitted to bet on football, full stop. That means players, managers and coaching staff. They cannot bet on their own games or on others. We will be making enquiries about this later this week and we will be speaking to Steve Claridge.\" The FA wrote to the Spurs defender John Scales in 1997 to remind him of the rules after he told on television of how he had won \u00a3800 on a game. Scales said he and some of his Wimbledon team-mates backed him to score the first goal in an FA Cup match against Sunderland in 1994. \"It was typical of what we used to do at Wimbledon,\" he said. \u0095 Leicester's midfielder Muzzy Izzet intends to turn his back on a career with England and play for Turkey in this summer's European Championship after being repeatedly overlooked by Kevin Keegan. Izzet has established himself as one of the Premiership's most impressive players but has had no direct contact with Keegan despite the Leicester manager Martin O'Neill orchestrating a vigorous campaign on the player's behalf. Born in south London, Izzet qualifies for Turkey through his father Mehmet and the 25-year-old has been offered a provisional place in Euro 2000 by the national manager Mustafa Denizli. \"I've spent the last few months wrestling with the biggest decision of my life,\" said Izzet. \"I've turned down Turkey twice before and if I said no again it might have been my last chance of international football. That's something I would have regretted for the rest of my career. \"Now I have made up my mind, I am looking forward to it as long as I get it in writing and confirmed properly.\" In the past, Izzet would have been required to undertake between six months and two years of national service, but the Turkish authorities have now relaxed that condition. \u0095 Marcus Stewart was last night discussing a move from Huddersfield to their promotion rivals Ipswich after the clubs agreed a \u00a33m fee, one of the highest ever between Nationwide League clubs. The 27-year-old striker, who scored twice in Huddersfield's 2-2 draw at Crystal Palace on Saturday, has hit 15 goals this season. Stewart's move comes as Huddersfield hope to conclude the \u00a3300,000 signing of of Sheffield United's forward Martin Smith today. \u0095 Ukraine will meet England at Wembley on May 31, according to the Ukrainian football federation's president. \"In the next few days we will fax the official reply to the English, that we have accepted their offer,\" Valery Pustovoitenko said yesterday.",

      "body": "<p>On October 5 1998, detective sergeant Mark Wareing and detective constable Marie Snitynski questioned Dr Harold Shipman over the death of Winifred Mellor. Dr Shipman had falsified her medical records to show she had a history of heart trouble but a later post mortem showed a fatal level of morphine.</p> <p><b>DC Marie Snitynski: </b>Can you indicate to me how severe the angina was at all? <br> <b>Harold Shipman: </b>The severity of angina doesn't indicate the likelihood of a coronary. I'm sure your medical experts would agree that. Erm she only, she had no signs of congestive heart failure, and she only got the pain of she rushed, but it was lasting two to three minutes. How does one grade angina, severe angina you don't even get out of bed. <br> <b>DC Marie Snitynski: </b>But from the progression you've noted on your records this was not something that was going to be unexpected. <br> <b>Harold Shipman: </b>This was a progressive angina, and people do die of coronaries with no proceeding history of angina. <br> <b>DC Marie Snitynski: </b>Well there are certain facts I need to make you aware of at this stage. I don't think there can be any dispute in a lot of them. Mrs Mellor's body was buried on the 18th May 1998 at Highfield cemetery, Stockport. Would you accept that from me? <br> <b>Harold Shipman: </b>If you say. <br> <b>DC Marie Snitynski: </b>Now would you accept that the body of Mrs Mellor was exhumed with the consent of the coroner on the 22nd September this year? [1998] <br> <b>Harold Shipman: </b>If you say so. <br> <b>DC Marie Snitynski: </b>And I think from what you were saying earlier that you were aware that a post-mortem examination was subsequently undertaken. Certain samples were taken at the post mortem for forensic analysis. Would you accept that? <br> <b>Harold Shipman: </b>You're telling the story, of course. <br> <b>DC Marie Snitynski: </b>A home office pathologist, Dr Rutherford carried out that post mortem examination. I think that as you were going to mention, his findings do not support that this lady died of a coronary thrombosis as you've diagnosed. Would you like to comment on that, that finding? <br> <b>Harold Shipman: </b>Doctors don't always diagnose a heart attack as a heart attack, they'll call it coronary thrombosis or miscardiaschema, micardienfarcture to the average run of the mill GP. They are all the same, the patient's dead. With a coronary thrombosis you would expect there would be a bit of heart muscle damaged but you can't have just an electrical disorganisation of the heart which kills you just as effectively and leaves no symptoms at all. No signs sorry. Signs at all. <br> <b>DC Marie Snitynski: </b>Well in his expert opinion there was nothing to support your diagnosis is what I'm saying. <br> <b>Harold Shipman: </b>But he couldn't rule out a disorganised electric, electrical activity of the heart. <br> <b>DC Marie Snitynski: </b>Forensic examination of the samples taken, including muscle tissue at that post mortem have been examined. These are the samples taken from Mrs Mellor and there's certainly a high level of morphine still contained in her body. A fatal level to be precise. Can you account for that? <br> <b>Harold Shipman: </b>No. <br> <b>DC Marie Snitynski: </b>Well I've got to put it to you doctor that you are the person who administered that lady with the drug, aren't you? <br> <b>Harold Shipman: </b>No. <br> <b>DC Marie Snitynski: </b>The levels were such that this woman actually died from toxicity of morphine, not as you wrongly diagnosed. In plain speaking you murdered her \u0085 One feature of these statements from the family was that they couldn't believe their own mother had chest pains, angina and hadn't been informed. <br> <b>Harold Shipman: </b>By, by whom? <br> <b>DC Marie Snitynski: </b>By her <br> <b>Harold Shipman: </b>By her, thank you. <br> <b>DC Marie Snitynski: </b>They also found it hard to believe that she would refuse any treatment she was given in relation to this diagnosis and I think now that we can answer why that was. Because she didn't have a history of chest complaints and heart disease and angina, did she doctor? <br> <b>Harold Shipman: </b>If it's written on the records then she had the history and therefore\u0085 <br> <b>DC Marie Snitynski: </b>The simple truth is you've fabricated a history to cover what you've done, you'd murdered her and you make up a history of angina and chest pains so you could issue a death certificate and placate this poor woman's family didn't you? <br> <b>Harold Shipman: </b>No. <br> <b>DC Marie Snitynski: </b>We've got a statement from a detective sergeant John Ashley who works in the field of computers. He has made a thorough examination of your computer, doctor, and the medical records contained on it. First of all he's produced a medical summary report which is that document. I'll put in on the table in front of me. It has a police reference of JFA41 and in essence it's what you've been looking at already on this lady's medical records. A copy of the records as they stand on the computer, but because this man's an expert he's able to interrogate computers and he has gone into this computer in some depth and what he's found is that there are a number of entries that have been incorrectly placed on this record to falsely mislead and to indicate this woman had a history of angina and chest pains.

      "bodyText": "On October 5 1998, detective sergeant Mark Wareing and detective constable Marie Snitynski questioned Dr Harold Shipman over the death of Winifred Mellor. Dr Shipman had falsified her medical records to show she had a history of heart trouble but a later post mortem showed a fatal level of morphine. DC Marie Snitynski: Can you indicate to me how severe the angina was at all? Harold Shipman: The severity of angina doesn't indicate the likelihood of a coronary. I'm sure your medical experts would agree that. Erm she only, she had no signs of congestive heart failure, and she only got the pain of she rushed, but it was lasting two to three minutes. How does one grade angina, severe angina you don't even get out of bed. DC Marie Snitynski: But from the progression you've noted on your records this was not something that was going to be unexpected. Harold Shipman: This was a progressive angina, and people do die of coronaries with no proceeding history of angina. DC Marie Snitynski: Well there are certain facts I need to make you aware of at this stage. I don't think there can be any dispute in a lot of them. Mrs Mellor's body was buried on the 18th May 1998 at Highfield cemetery, Stockport. Would you accept that from me? Harold Shipman: If you say. DC Marie Snitynski: Now would you accept that the body of Mrs Mellor was exhumed with the consent of the coroner on the 22nd September this year? [1998] Harold Shipman: If you say so. DC Marie Snitynski: And I think from what you were saying earlier that you were aware that a post-mortem examination was subsequently undertaken. Certain samples were taken at the post mortem for forensic analysis. Would you accept that? Harold Shipman: You're telling the story, of course. DC Marie Snitynski: A home office pathologist, Dr Rutherford carried out that post mortem examination. I think that as you were going to mention, his findings do not support that this lady died of a coronary thrombosis as you've diagnosed. Would you like to comment on that, that finding? Harold Shipman: Doctors don't always diagnose a heart attack as a heart attack, they'll call it coronary thrombosis or miscardiaschema, micardienfarcture to the average run of the mill GP. They are all the same, the patient's dead. With a coronary thrombosis you would expect there would be a bit of heart muscle damaged but you can't have just an electrical disorganisation of the heart which kills you just as effectively and leaves no symptoms at all. No signs sorry. Signs at all. DC Marie Snitynski: Well in his expert opinion there was nothing to support your diagnosis is what I'm saying. Harold Shipman: But he couldn't rule out a disorganised electric, electrical activity of the heart. DC Marie Snitynski: Forensic examination of the samples taken, including muscle tissue at that post mortem have been examined. These are the samples taken from Mrs Mellor and there's certainly a high level of morphine still contained in her body. A fatal level to be precise. Can you account for that? Harold Shipman: No. DC Marie Snitynski: Well I've got to put it to you doctor that you are the person who administered that lady with the drug, aren't you? Harold Shipman: No. DC Marie Snitynski: The levels were such that this woman actually died from toxicity of morphine, not as you wrongly diagnosed. In plain speaking you murdered her \u0085 One feature of these statements from the family was that they couldn't believe their own mother had chest pains, angina and hadn't been informed. Harold Shipman: By, by whom? DC Marie Snitynski: By her Harold Shipman: By her, thank you. DC Marie Snitynski: They also found it hard to believe that she would refuse any treatment she was given in relation to this diagnosis and I think now that we can answer why that was. Because she didn't have a history of chest complaints and heart disease and angina, did she doctor? Harold Shipman: If it's written on the records then she had the history and therefore\u0085 DC Marie Snitynski: The simple truth is you've fabricated a history to cover what you've done, you'd murdered her and you make up a history of angina and chest pains so you could issue a death certificate and placate this poor woman's family didn't you? Harold Shipman: No. DC Marie Snitynski: We've got a statement from a detective sergeant John Ashley who works in the field of computers. He has made a thorough examination of your computer, doctor, and the medical records contained on it. First of all he's produced a medical summary report which is that document. I'll put in on the table in front of me. It has a police reference of JFA41 and in essence it's what you've been looking at already on this lady's medical records. A copy of the records as they stand on the computer, but because this man's an expert he's able to interrogate computers and he has gone into this computer in some depth and what he's found is that there are a number of entries that have been incorrectly placed on this record to falsely mislead and to indicate this woman had a history of angina and chest pains. What have you got to say about that doctor? Harold Shipman: Nothing.",

      "body": "<p>The conviction of Harold Shipman for the murder of 15 of his patients confirms him as one of the the most prolific serial killers of the modern era.</p> <p>Only Dennis Nilsen is known to have killed as many in Britain, although the exact number of men he strangled and mutilated at his flat at Cranley Gardens in Muswell Hill, London - thought to be between 12 and 16 - is still a matter of conjecture. Shipman's case is different because detectives, who investigated 130 deaths, believe he killed at least 15 and more charges are expected.</p> <p>But Shipman, unlike most serial killers, did not kill with violence. His modus operandi, a swift injection of a lethal dose of morphine, distinguishes him from the brutality and bloodshed that usually marks out a murderer.</p> <p>The list of Britain's most prolific killers also contains the Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe, who was found guilty in 1981 of murdering 13 women, aged from 16 to 47.</p> <p>His murder spree started in October 1975 when he beat and stabbed a prostitute. He later claimed he wanted to rid the world of prostitutes and described the murders as \"just cleaning up streets\". Sutcliffe was captured five years later.</p> <p>More recently Fred West is thought to have killed 12 people at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester. West committed suicide in prison before standing trial but his wife, Rosemary, was convicted in 1995 of murdering 10 women and girls. The victims were tortured, raped and murdered and then buried at Cromwell Street.</p> <p>Detective Superintendent John Bennett, who led the investigation, said: \"This was a terrible case. It is quite clear that Mrs West must be a psychopath. She and Frederick West were a perfect pair for each other.\"</p> <p>But there have been cases of even more prolific murderers in other parts of the world.</p> <p>If convicted by the Chinese courts, Hu Wanlin could be the most prolific killer yet known. He claimed he was a healer who possessed a mysterious force of qi, or vital energy. He is said to have set up hospitals in two Chinese provinces several years ago, but his treatments allegedly killed 146 patients. He is awaiting trial.</p> <p>Last March Anatoly Onoprienko was convicted by a Ukrainian court of murdering 52 people, 10 of them children.</p> <p>The former forestry student - nicknamed \"the Terminator\" by local newspapers - would burst into homes at random and kill entire families with his sawn-off hunting gun. Before his trial, he told reporters: \"I have no regrets, no remorse and I would do it again if I could.\"</p> <p>A Russian cannibalistic killer, Andrei Chikatilo, admitted murdering 55 people in an 11-year period. At his trial, he blamed a deprived childhood and a lack of motherly love for his obsession. \"I am a freak of nature, a mad beast,\" Chikatilo told the court. He was executed in 1994.</p> <p>In the US, Jeffrey Dahmer was jailed in 1992 for murdering 17 teenagers in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Two years after his conviction he was killed by a fellow jail inmate who used a mop handle to stab him in the eye.</p> <p>\"You think you have seen it all, then something like this happens,\" said a police officer who was among the first to enter Dahmer's apartment.

      "bodyText": "The conviction of Harold Shipman for the murder of 15 of his patients confirms him as one of the the most prolific serial killers of the modern era. Only Dennis Nilsen is known to have killed as many in Britain, although the exact number of men he strangled and mutilated at his flat at Cranley Gardens in Muswell Hill, London - thought to be between 12 and 16 - is still a matter of conjecture. Shipman's case is different because detectives, who investigated 130 deaths, believe he killed at least 15 and more charges are expected. But Shipman, unlike most serial killers, did not kill with violence. His modus operandi, a swift injection of a lethal dose of morphine, distinguishes him from the brutality and bloodshed that usually marks out a murderer. The list of Britain's most prolific killers also contains the Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe, who was found guilty in 1981 of murdering 13 women, aged from 16 to 47. His murder spree started in October 1975 when he beat and stabbed a prostitute. He later claimed he wanted to rid the world of prostitutes and described the murders as \"just cleaning up streets\". Sutcliffe was captured five years later. More recently Fred West is thought to have killed 12 people at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester. West committed suicide in prison before standing trial but his wife, Rosemary, was convicted in 1995 of murdering 10 women and girls. The victims were tortured, raped and murdered and then buried at Cromwell Street. Detective Superintendent John Bennett, who led the investigation, said: \"This was a terrible case. It is quite clear that Mrs West must be a psychopath. She and Frederick West were a perfect pair for each other.\" But there have been cases of even more prolific murderers in other parts of the world. If convicted by the Chinese courts, Hu Wanlin could be the most prolific killer yet known. He claimed he was a healer who possessed a mysterious force of qi, or vital energy. He is said to have set up hospitals in two Chinese provinces several years ago, but his treatments allegedly killed 146 patients. He is awaiting trial. Last March Anatoly Onoprienko was convicted by a Ukrainian court of murdering 52 people, 10 of them children. The former forestry student - nicknamed \"the Terminator\" by local newspapers - would burst into homes at random and kill entire families with his sawn-off hunting gun. Before his trial, he told reporters: \"I have no regrets, no remorse and I would do it again if I could.\" A Russian cannibalistic killer, Andrei Chikatilo, admitted murdering 55 people in an 11-year period. At his trial, he blamed a deprived childhood and a lack of motherly love for his obsession. \"I am a freak of nature, a mad beast,\" Chikatilo told the court. He was executed in 1994. In the US, Jeffrey Dahmer was jailed in 1992 for murdering 17 teenagers in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Two years after his conviction he was killed by a fellow jail inmate who used a mop handle to stab him in the eye. \"You think you have seen it all, then something like this happens,\" said a police officer who was among the first to enter Dahmer's apartment. When they broke in police discovered that the killer kept severed heads at his home; two were found in the fridge. He had crammed the torsos of four men into a barrel and other body parts were strewn around the floor or stored in jars. Dahmer later told detectives: \"I knew I was sick or evil or both.\" Bewildering body counts Hu Wanlin, a healer in China arrested last year, charged with killing 146 patients Andrei Chikatilo, a Russian who admitted 55 murders. Executed six years ago Anatoly Onoprienko, a Ukrainian convicted of killing 52, including 10 children Jeffrey Dahmer, jailed in 1992 for murdering 17 teenagers in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Killed by fellow prisoner two years after conviction Burke and Hare, the Edinburgh murderers, who killed 16, selling human organs to medical schools in the 1850s Harold Shipman, convicted of 15 murders, but with 23 cases outstanding Dennis Nilsen, believed to have killed up to 16 people in the early 80s.

      "body": "<p>Today, more children are enrolled in more schools around the globe than at any time in history. This fact reflects the sacrifices of millions of parents and teachers in the developing world, and the visionary commitments and bold actions of many political leaders.</p> <p>Yet the accomplishment barely taps into the potential of education as perhaps the single most critical factor in a child's well-being and in the economic and social development of a nation. And it is only the first step in a worldwide campaign to ensure that all children on the planet receive a basic, good quality education as is their due under the Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p> <p>Clearly, greater investment in education produces benefits beyond the gains for children. One only has to compare the rapid economic development of south-east Asia, where education has been a budget priority, with poverty's stranglehold in south Asia, where education has not received adequate resources.</p> <p>In country after country, a strong education system that reaches girls and boys alike has proved significant in countering patterns of poverty, community violence, civil conflict, gender discrimination and HIV/Aids. And for countries racked by turmoil and war, education has been a crucial factor in re-establishing stability and a sense of normality for children in an uncertain world.</p> <p>Despite these multiple returns on investments, money for education remains hard to come by, with budget purse strings and assistance packages getting tighter even as the need for educational reforms grows.</p> <p>Aggregated national statistics often hide the fact that access to school is blocked for many children, especially girls, ethnic minorities, children with disabilities and those affected by HIV/Aids. More than 125m children in the world, the majority girls, are not enrolled in school. For millions of children, exploitative and hazardous labour replaces studying long before graduation day. Changing family fortunes force hundreds of thousands of primary school students to lose days, weeks and sometimes months of school. Political instability and armed conflicts, such as those in Kosovo, East Timor and Sudan, keep children in hiding, in camps or on the run rather than at their desks and in their playgrounds.</p> <p>Even if universal access is achieved, as it could be with an estimated $8bn (\u00a35bn) a year in additional funding, changes will be needed in what children learn, and how and where they learn. A basic education means more than learning to read and count, and more than developing the technical skills to succeed in the 21st century. It means being exposed to experiences that build self-esteem, inculcate a respect for the rights of girls and boys alike and for children of different cultures and social groups, while interacting in ways that improve decision-making skills and foster non-violent ways to solve conflicts.</p> <p>For this to happen, curriculums must be modernised, teachers retrained and new ones recruited. Classrooms have to be transformed into \"child-friendly\" spaces in places that are safe and healthy, where the human rights of children, including the rights to self-expression and to have their opinions count, are respected. Places where the best interests of children are paramount.</p> <p>And if societies are serious about helping children to succeed in school, they must start paying more attention to children long before they start primary school - during the early years, when their healthy growth and development depends on healthy mothers and supportive families, good nutrition and comprehensive and coordinated health services, safe drinking water, uncontaminated food and unpolluted air, as well as on care that enhances the child's cognitive, physical and emotional development, and on the precious opportunities to play and laugh - to be a child.</p> <p>The obligation to ensure every child's right to education lies with the national governments of the 191 countries which have signed the Convention on the Rights of the Child. But the challenge of transforming education into a process that is integral to individual wellbeing and social progress cannot be met by ministries of education alone. The task depends not only on the financial and political commitment of governments, but on stronger ties between schools, families and community. Ultimately, the responsibility sits with each of us.</p>",

This fact reflects the sacrifices of millions of parents and teachers in the developing world, and the visionary commitments and bold actions of many political leaders. Yet the accomplishment barely taps into the potential of education as perhaps the single most critical factor in a child's well-being and in the economic and social development of a nation. And it is only the first step in a worldwide campaign to ensure that all children on the planet receive a basic, good quality education as is their due under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Clearly, greater investment in education produces benefits beyond the gains for children. One only has to compare the rapid economic development of south-east Asia, where education has been a budget priority, with poverty's stranglehold in south Asia, where education has not received adequate resources. In country after country, a strong education system that reaches girls and boys alike has proved significant in countering patterns of poverty, community violence, civil conflict, gender discrimination and HIV/Aids. And for countries racked by turmoil and war, education has been a crucial factor in re-establishing stability and a sense of normality for children in an uncertain world. Despite these multiple returns on investments, money for education remains hard to come by, with budget purse strings and assistance packages getting tighter even as the need for educational reforms grows. Aggregated national statistics often hide the fact that access to school is blocked for many children, especially girls, ethnic minorities, children with disabilities and those affected by HIV/Aids. More than 125m children in the world, the majority girls, are not enrolled in school. For millions of children, exploitative and hazardous labour replaces studying long before graduation day. Changing family fortunes force hundreds of thousands of primary school students to lose days, weeks and sometimes months of school. Political instability and armed conflicts, such as those in Kosovo, East Timor and Sudan, keep children in hiding, in camps or on the run rather than at their desks and in their playgrounds. Even if universal access is achieved, as it could be with an estimated $8bn (\u00a35bn) a year in additional funding, changes will be needed in what children learn, and how and where they learn. A basic education means more than learning to read and count, and more than developing the technical skills to succeed in the 21st century. It means being exposed to experiences that build self-esteem, inculcate a respect for the rights of girls and boys alike and for children of different cultures and social groups, while interacting in ways that improve decision-making skills and foster non-violent ways to solve conflicts. For this to happen, curriculums must be modernised, teachers retrained and new ones recruited. Classrooms have to be transformed into \"child-friendly\" spaces in places that are safe and healthy, where the human rights of children, including the rights to self-expression and to have their opinions count, are respected. Places where the best interests of children are paramount. And if societies are serious about helping children to succeed in school, they must start paying more attention to children long before they start primary school - during the early years, when their healthy growth and development depends on healthy mothers and supportive families, good nutrition and comprehensive and coordinated health services, safe drinking water, uncontaminated food and unpolluted air, as well as on care that enhances the child's cognitive, physical and emotional development, and on the precious opportunities to play and laugh - to be a child. The obligation to ensure every child's right to education lies with the national governments of the 191 countries which have signed the Convention on the Rights of the Child. But the challenge of transforming education into a process that is integral to individual wellbeing and social progress cannot be met by ministries of education alone. The task depends not only on the financial and political commitment of governments, but on stronger ties between schools, families and community. Ultimately, the responsibility sits with each of us.",

These learners are living in shacks, some without electricity. They study by candle. Some of them have to help bring money home because their families are the poorest of the poor. About three quarters of the fathers are unemployed.\"</p> <p>Leshata secondary school (motto: \"Let your loins be girded and your lamps be burning\") has come a long way in a short time. In 1997, only one third of its pupils passed their matric. A year later, the success rate shot up to 93%.</p> <p>Mr Molelekoa attributes part of the turnaround to the school getting its own buildings. For years, Leshata had to share premises with two other schools. Children learned in shifts.</p> <p>With their own premises, Leshata's pupils are encouraged to continue working after regular school hours, which run from 7.30am to 2.45pm.</p> <p>\"We do not knock off until five o'clock,\" Mr Molelekoa said. \"Poverty affects the activity of the mind. Each and every matric subject is given double time daily.\"</p> <p>Many teachers in South African state schools are poorly paid and unmotivated. Some take second jobs to survive. A generation after pupils led an anti-apartheid boycott of schools to demand \"liberation before education\", indiscipline is the rule in many classrooms. Some teachers live in fear of pupils who carry guns to school.</p> <p>But Leshata has a different philosophy. \"The important thing here is the learner, not the teacher,\" Mr Molelekoa said. \"It's very easy to motivate poor children. They live in shacks. You can tell them that the only way they are ever going to live in the rich suburbs is through education.</p> <p>\"I tell them that we have to live with the parents God has given us, and if they are poor that is not their fault. But you can chose your future. You can make things different.\"</p> <p>Leshata has few resources. There are no computers, scientific equipment or musical instruments. It puts the school at a huge disadvantage compared to the private institutions attended by many white children in Johannesburg.</p> <p>But Mr Molelekoa says his pupils are far better off than the black children educated under apartheid.</p> <p>\"We have a new school. The government does not have much money but it is really trying to help us,\" he said.</p> <p>Leshata wages a constant battle against burglary and vandalism - not by pupils but by local residents. There is no electricity in classrooms because all the junction boxes and fittings have been stolen. The school built a strongroom to store the photocopier and typewriters. Thieves cut their way through the thick metal door.</p> <p>\"The community around us does not always value education. It's our biggest problem. People want bread to survive, not education - so they come and take what little we have,\" Mr Molelekoa said.</p> <p>The parents of most of the pupils face the same struggle for survival. All state schools in South Africa have fees. It costs 80 rand (\u00a38) a year to go to Leshata, among the cheapest in the country. But many families in Orange Farm still have trouble finding the money.</p> <p>However good their results, most pupils cannot afford higher education. Last year, one went to medical school. Leshata paid for his first year at university, but it cannot afford to do that for all pupils. The school has launched a trust to help others.</p> <p>\"They have to go to work after matric. They don't have the money for anything else. Some have ailing parents or they're orphans,\" said Mr Molelekoa.</p> <p>\"But having your matric is a big opportunity. It means you have a tool, a weapon to go out with and fight for your place in society. Then maybe their children will be able to go to university.\"</p>",

These learners are living in shacks, some without electricity. They study by candle. Some of them have to help bring money home because their families are the poorest of the poor. About three quarters of the fathers are unemployed.\" Leshata secondary school (motto: \"Let your loins be girded and your lamps be burning\") has come a long way in a short time. In 1997, only one third of its pupils passed their matric. A year later, the success rate shot up to 93%. Mr Molelekoa attributes part of the turnaround to the school getting its own buildings. For years, Leshata had to share premises with two other schools. Children learned in shifts. With their own premises, Leshata's pupils are encouraged to continue working after regular school hours, which run from 7.30am to 2.45pm. \"We do not knock off until five o'clock,\" Mr Molelekoa said. \"Poverty affects the activity of the mind. Each and every matric subject is given double time daily.\" Many teachers in South African state schools are poorly paid and unmotivated. Some take second jobs to survive. A generation after pupils led an anti-apartheid boycott of schools to demand \"liberation before education\", indiscipline is the rule in many classrooms. Some teachers live in fear of pupils who carry guns to school. But Leshata has a different philosophy. \"The important thing here is the learner, not the teacher,\" Mr Molelekoa said. \"It's very easy to motivate poor children. They live in shacks. You can tell them that the only way they are ever going to live in the rich suburbs is through education. \"I tell them that we have to live with the parents God has given us, and if they are poor that is not their fault. But you can chose your future. You can make things different.\" Leshata has few resources. There are no computers, scientific equipment or musical instruments. It puts the school at a huge disadvantage compared to the private institutions attended by many white children in Johannesburg. But Mr Molelekoa says his pupils are far better off than the black children educated under apartheid. \"We have a new school. The government does not have much money but it is really trying to help us,\" he said. Leshata wages a constant battle against burglary and vandalism - not by pupils but by local residents. There is no electricity in classrooms because all the junction boxes and fittings have been stolen. The school built a strongroom to store the photocopier and typewriters. Thieves cut their way through the thick metal door. \"The community around us does not always value education. It's our biggest problem. People want bread to survive, not education - so they come and take what little we have,\" Mr Molelekoa said. The parents of most of the pupils face the same struggle for survival. All state schools in South Africa have fees. It costs 80 rand (\u00a38) a year to go to Leshata, among the cheapest in the country. But many families in Orange Farm still have trouble finding the money. However good their results, most pupils cannot afford higher education. Last year, one went to medical school. Leshata paid for his first year at university, but it cannot afford to do that for all pupils. The school has launched a trust to help others. \"They have to go to work after matric. They don't have the money for anything else. Some have ailing parents or they're orphans,\" said Mr Molelekoa. \"But having your matric is a big opportunity. It means you have a tool, a weapon to go out with and fight for your place in society. Then maybe their children will be able to go to university.\"",

Now technology is entering the equation, and the UN has warned that as computers spread throughout western classrooms, the knowledge gap is widening. Last year's UN human development report talked of a new digital divide, with poor countries facing the prospect of being further marginalised in an increasingly knowledge-based global economy. The internet, the world's fastest growing communications tool, is still largely a western phenomenon - so being connected to the web is becoming a new demarcation line between the rich and the poor. In the US, President Bill Clinton has pledged that every American classroom will be hooked up to the internet by the end of this year; there are already more computers in America than all the rest of the world put together. Tony Blair has similar aspirations for Britain. Meanwhile, south Asia, which is to home to 23% of the world's people, has less than 1% of the world's internet users.

      "body": "<p>Valentine's Day is, according to popular stereotype, all about heartfelt romantic gestures and sacrificial offerings on the altar of true lurve. Cards are carefully selected for their meanings, anonymous messages are cautiously composed, envelopes sealed with a loving kiss and sensuous bundles of flowers chosen to either start up or re-affirm a love affair. </p> <p>Given all this, sorting out your Valentine's Day in ten minutes at the office, courtesy of the net, seems a little short on romance.</p> <p>Fair enough. But, just for a moment, forget all that and think about what Valentine's Day shopping is like in reality. Think of the last-minute trawls to florists which only have a couple of battered, wilting roses left. Think of the local card shops which have sold out apart from the cute teddy bear variety. Ask yourself whether you can get away with yet another box of supermarket own-brand truffles this year. </p> <p>Shopping online isn't for everyone, but if you're after convenience, more choice than the average high street or just a few new ideas, the net is a good place to go. However you will need to plan ahead, to take into account delivery times (although many sites are offering an express service, with last orders usually on February 11). </p> <p>To help you find what's out there, we've put together the Shopping Unlimited Valentine's mini-directory, a selection of some of the best places to buy love tokens online. As you'll see, the net is a great place to sort out the basics; cards, chocolates and flowers. </p> <p><strong>Greetings cards</strong></p> <p> There are now plenty of sites where you can buy greetings cards. You can then either get the cards sent to you or pay a little extra and get the site itself to add your personal message to your card, then post it on. </p> <p>Some card sites are offering special chocolates and card packages for Valentine's Day. There's also no shortage of specialist sites in this area. You can either try familiar high street chains, local shops that have gone online or mail order specialists. If you're ordering from a smaller site, check the delivery deadlines carefully before you buy. With bigger concerns you can order much closer to February 14. </p> <p><strong>Flowers and chocolates</strong></p> <p> Again, there are a few chocolate sites that offer combined gifts (chocolates with either flowers or champagne or both). But there's no shortage of specialists when it comes to sending flowers online. </p> <p>People are used to ordering flowers over the telephone, and, truth be told, if you already have a relationship with a telephone florist, ordering something from them will probably be quicker than starting afresh online. That said, the net does help the florally illiterate, in that you can see what the flowers you're ordering look like. Of course, it could be argued that everyone knows what twelve red roses look like, and that is basically what is on offer online at the big net florists.</p> <p>If you want something different, the net can help you out, courtesy of some of the smaller florists who have gone online. As ever, check delivery deadlines carefully before you buy. And don't assume that you're bound to get better service from the bigger brands. One Guardian Unlimited employee had a particularly bad experience when trying to get flowers sent via the Interflora site. That doesn't mean you will, of course. But it's worth bearing in mind.</p> <p>Many net gift shops will also sell you flowers and chocolates, along with jewellery and all sorts of lovey-dovey knick-knacks. Several net retailers (ie the sites that deal in books, music and video) have Valentine's promotions up listing various gift ideas. These can be a little hackneyed (Big Barry White, Notting Hill and 'The Nation's Favourite Love Poems' are standard choices). Nevertheless, you might find the odd good idea.</p> <p><strong>Out of the ordinary gifts</strong></p> <p>If you're looking for something out of the ordinary (but aren't quite sure what that might be), some online retailers will come to your aid. The better gift shops do have some interestingly-offbeat ideas, including theatre and entertainment tickets, flights and weekend breaks. If a surprise weekend break might do the trick, it's also worth looking in the Travel section of the general Shopping Unlimited directory. </p> <p>Auctions are also a good place to come if you're looking for something special - perhaps a gift for a long-term partner, something you know he or she would like. The only problem is that it takes time. Auctions last seven days or so, usually, then you have to get the goods sent to you by the seller. So it may be a little late now. That said, many of the auction sites are making an effort to put Valentine-friendly items up for sale. Amazon's auction section, for example, was recently taking bids on five hours at a swanky beauty salon and seems likely to be offering similar stuff over the next two weeks. </p> <p><strong>For the cybergeeks...</strong></p> <p>Of course, if all this dealing in the world of atoms, where you have to get things sent to your loved one, strikes you as rather old-fashioned, you could always go completely virtual. </p> <p>A few online gift and card shops will now let you email 'virtual cards' to the objects of your affection. Some let you design the card too (try Cybercard www.cybercard.co.uk). Once you've found a card you like, you fill out the details - who it's for, your message etc - and then press send. Your intended recipient then usually gets an email saying there's a card waiting for them at the site, complete with a link to the relevant page. They can then go to the site to check it out. Some sites will let you send virtual cards anonymously. Others won't. </p> <p>If you don't have anyone to send a virtual Valentine to, you could always try the 'Love Affirmation' ecards on over at the sickly Loving You http://cards.lovingyou.com. The idea here seems to be to tell the world that you have decided to love yourself. Sample messages include \"I will forgive myself and release all feelings about not being good enough.

      "bodyText": "Valentine's Day is, according to popular stereotype, all about heartfelt romantic gestures and sacrificial offerings on the altar of true lurve. Cards are carefully selected for their meanings, anonymous messages are cautiously composed, envelopes sealed with a loving kiss and sensuous bundles of flowers chosen to either start up or re-affirm a love affair. Given all this, sorting out your Valentine's Day in ten minutes at the office, courtesy of the net, seems a little short on romance. Fair enough. But, just for a moment, forget all that and think about what Valentine's Day shopping is like in reality. Think of the last-minute trawls to florists which only have a couple of battered, wilting roses left. Think of the local card shops which have sold out apart from the cute teddy bear variety. Ask yourself whether you can get away with yet another box of supermarket own-brand truffles this year. Shopping online isn't for everyone, but if you're after convenience, more choice than the average high street or just a few new ideas, the net is a good place to go. However you will need to plan ahead, to take into account delivery times (although many sites are offering an express service, with last orders usually on February 11). To help you find what's out there, we've put together the Shopping Unlimited Valentine's mini-directory, a selection of some of the best places to buy love tokens online. As you'll see, the net is a great place to sort out the basics; cards, chocolates and flowers. Greetings cards There are now plenty of sites where you can buy greetings cards. You can then either get the cards sent to you or pay a little extra and get the site itself to add your personal message to your card, then post it on. Some card sites are offering special chocolates and card packages for Valentine's Day. There's also no shortage of specialist sites in this area. You can either try familiar high street chains, local shops that have gone online or mail order specialists. If you're ordering from a smaller site, check the delivery deadlines carefully before you buy. With bigger concerns you can order much closer to February 14. Flowers and chocolates Again, there are a few chocolate sites that offer combined gifts (chocolates with either flowers or champagne or both). But there's no shortage of specialists when it comes to sending flowers online. People are used to ordering flowers over the telephone, and, truth be told, if you already have a relationship with a telephone florist, ordering something from them will probably be quicker than starting afresh online. That said, the net does help the florally illiterate, in that you can see what the flowers you're ordering look like. Of course, it could be argued that everyone knows what twelve red roses look like, and that is basically what is on offer online at the big net florists. If you want something different, the net can help you out, courtesy of some of the smaller florists who have gone online. As ever, check delivery deadlines carefully before you buy. And don't assume that you're bound to get better service from the bigger brands. One Guardian Unlimited employee had a particularly bad experience when trying to get flowers sent via the Interflora site. That doesn't mean you will, of course. But it's worth bearing in mind. Many net gift shops will also sell you flowers and chocolates, along with jewellery and all sorts of lovey-dovey knick-knacks. Several net retailers (ie the sites that deal in books, music and video) have Valentine's promotions up listing various gift ideas. These can be a little hackneyed (Big Barry White, Notting Hill and 'The Nation's Favourite Love Poems' are standard choices). Nevertheless, you might find the odd good idea. Out of the ordinary gifts If you're looking for something out of the ordinary (but aren't quite sure what that might be), some online retailers will come to your aid. The better gift shops do have some interestingly-offbeat ideas, including theatre and entertainment tickets, flights and weekend breaks. If a surprise weekend break might do the trick, it's also worth looking in the Travel section of the general Shopping Unlimited directory. Auctions are also a good place to come if you're looking for something special - perhaps a gift for a long-term partner, something you know he or she would like. The only problem is that it takes time. Auctions last seven days or so, usually, then you have to get the goods sent to you by the seller. So it may be a little late now. That said, many of the auction sites are making an effort to put Valentine-friendly items up for sale. Amazon's auction section, for example, was recently taking bids on five hours at a swanky beauty salon and seems likely to be offering similar stuff over the next two weeks. For the cybergeeks... Of course, if all this dealing in the world of atoms, where you have to get things sent to your loved one, strikes you as rather old-fashioned, you could always go completely virtual. A few online gift and card shops will now let you email 'virtual cards' to the objects of your affection. Some let you design the card too (try Cybercard www.cybercard.co.uk). Once you've found a card you like, you fill out the details - who it's for, your message etc - and then press send. Your intended recipient then usually gets an email saying there's a card waiting for them at the site, complete with a link to the relevant page. They can then go to the site to check it out. Some sites will let you send virtual cards anonymously. Others won't. If you don't have anyone to send a virtual Valentine to, you could always try the 'Love Affirmation' ecards on over at the sickly Loving You http://cards.lovingyou.com. The idea here seems to be to tell the world that you have decided to love yourself. Sample messages include \"I will forgive myself and release all feelings about not being good enough. I will love myself...\" and \"I am a good positive magnet! I express peace, happiness, prosperity, love and liberation!\" Oh yes. Perhaps, if you were feeling particularly desperate, you could send yourself one on February 14. Or your other singleton buddies, perhaps. Then again, perhaps you should just buy yourself some chocolates instead.",

      "body": "<p>With permission, Madam Speaker I wish to make a statement about the Harold Shipman case. Harold Shipman is the general practitioner from Hyde, Greater Manchester, who the House will know was found guilty yesterday at Preston crown court on 15 charges of murder, and of forging the will of one of his patients.</p> <p>I understand that the crown prosecution service are considering further charges. The police have investigated a total of 136 cases.</p> <p>The whole House and indeed the whole country will have been shocked to hear the detail of these dreadful crimes. I am sure that all hon. and rt. hon. members will want to join me in offering on our deepest condolences to all the relatives and friends of the people who died at the hands of Harold Shipman.</p> <p>These relatives and friends have endured the ordeal of a lengthy public trial with quiet dignity. Our sympathies today are with those families.</p> <p>We now know that Harold Shipman murdered at least fifteen women patients. They had placed their trust in him as their local GP. He abused his position of trust in a way that was callous, systematic and determined.</p> <p>As Mr Justice Forbes, the judge presiding in the trial said yesterday, he murdered each and every one of his victims by a calculating and cold blooded perversion of his medical skills. It is almost beyond belief that a doctor could act in this way.</p> <p>The relationship between individual doctor and individual patient is built upon trust. The Shipman case must not be allowed to erode the bond which rightly exists between our excellent family doctors and the families they serve.</p> <p>GPs in this country, almost without exception, are hardworking, honest and trustworthy. It is almost universally agreed that we have one of the finest family doctor services in the world. It is imperative in my view that we protect that reputation even as we learn the lessons of the Shipman case.</p> <p>It is of course true that a determined criminal can defeat the best regulated organisation in pursuit of his purpose. But we must be confident that we do indeed have the best systems for regulation and self-regulation firmly in place.</p> <p>There is no doubt that those systems have to be strengthened and to be changed. Harold Shipman not only managed to perpetrate these appalling crimes he managed to get away with them for years without being discovered.</p> <p>Members of this House and members of the public will want to be reassured about whether these awful events could have been foreseen and avoided, whether the early signs could have been detected sooner and whether action to halt Harold Shipman could have been taken earlier.</p> <p>It is to answer these and other questions in a careful and considered way that I can tell the House that I intend to establish an independent inquiry into the issues raised by the murder of patients by Harold Shipman.</p> <p>I am establishing this inquiry using the powers I have as secretary of state as defined in section 2 of the NHS Act 1977 and with the support of the home seceretary. The inquiry will be comprehensive and inclusive. The victims' relatives in particular will of course be able to present their views and experiences to the inquiry. The report of the inquiry will be made public.</p> <p>I am publishing the terms of reference for the inquiry today. A copy has been placed in the Library of the House. Given the issues of confidence raised by the Shipman case the inquiry must act thoroughly and speedily. It will report to me in the autumn.</p> <p>It will be chaired by Lord Laming of Tewin, the former chief inspector of social services. The inquiry's primary purpose will be to make recommendations on how best patients can be safeguarded in the future.</p> <p>It will look at the role played by all the agencies involved in the Shipman case including the coroner, registrar, police and health services. It will examine all relevant issues including the measures needed to safeguard against the risks of isolated professional medical practice, GPs access to controlled drugs and the role of the NHS tribunal.</p> <p>We have received and noted the West Pennine health authority's internal report on the Shipman case. Last night the health authority announced the suspension of its GP advisor. The health authority report will no doubt be considered by the inquiry but equally the inquiry will also be charged with properly scrutinising the role and conduct of the health authority itself.</p> <p>It will also be important that the general medical council's involvement in Harold Shipman's case is examined by the inquiry, that lessons are learned and that recommendations for reform are made. The GMC must genuinely exist to protect patients. It must be truly accountable and it must be guided at all times by the welfare and safety of patients.</p> <p>The House will know that the government and the medical profession are already taking action to modernise regulatory structures and to deal with poor performance wherever it occurs in medicine. The general medical council is developing proposals for assessment and revalidation of all doctors' licenses to practice at five yearly intervals.</p> <p>To strengthen and underpin this in November last year the chief medical officer produced recommendations in his report, Supporting Doctors, Protecting Patients to identify and deal with the small minority of doctors whose performance or behaviour gives cause for concern. It proposes that there should be annual appraisal of all doctors including GPs. Until now there has been no such system.</p> <p>It proposes that health authorities should have the power to suspend GPs when the circumstances indicate patients may be at risk. They do not have that power at the moment.</p> <p>Finally it proposes that participation of GPs in external clinical audit should in future be mandatory. It is not mandatory at present.</p> <p>The detail of these proposals is still being consulted on. But we now need to press ahead as quickly as possible with them.</p> <p>In parallel the government intends that the system of clinical governance should apply to all doctors. It will promote high standards of care and introduce accountability in a way that has not existed in the past. Isolation in which an individual doctor's pattern of practice is hidden from view will be a thing of the past. The new system will in turn be monitored by the new independent commission for health improvement</p> <p>Our proposals will provide safeguards against the rare doctor who poses a grave and immediate threat to patients' safety.</p> <p>In the process they will improve GPs' accountability without preventing them from getting on with the job of treating and caring for their patients.</p> <p>Madam Speaker to reinforce the steps that are in already in train and those that the inquiry may recommend I believe that there are certain immediate actions which the government needs to take in the light of the Shipman trial.</p> <p>Firstly, the way the NHS tribunal currently works means that the health service would continue to pay Harold Shipman for around another month following his conviction for murder. That is inconceivable. I am acting urgently to make sure it does not happen. Similarly the powers I have as secretary of state allow me to remove pension entitlements from those recipients who have seriously damaged public confidence in the NHS. I am today giving notice that I am considering removing Harold Shipman's pension entitlements.</p> <p>Secondly, despite his convictions for murder Harold Shipman today is still a registered doctor with the general medical council. The public will now expect that the GMC gives its most urgent attention to removing Harold Shipman from its register of medical practitioners.</p> <p>Thirdly, at present there is nothing to require a family doctor to disclose a past criminal conviction or a previous professional censure to prospective partners or a health authority. In the 1970s, Harold Shipman had a conviction for obtaining and misusing a controlled drug. He had a record with the general medical council. Yet this did not lead anyone to monitor him more closely than any other doctor. That will now change.</p> <p>I can tell the House that we shall be requiring doctors to disclose criminal convictions and action taken against them by a professional regulatory body whether in the UK or abroad - before they can be appointed to medical lists.</p> <p>Fourthly, we intend to make it compulsory for GPs to report deaths in their surgeries and other serious incidents to health authorities. At the same time we are working with the office for national statistics to find new and better ways of monitoring deaths of GPs patients.</p> <p>Fifthly, I have asked the chief medical officer to commission and oversee a clinical audit of Harold Shipman's past practice. The audit will examine the pattern of deaths, certified causes of deaths, prescribing of restricted drugs and will examine the relevant medical records. Any concerns highlighted by the audit will be drawn to the attention of the relevant authorities. Finally, my RHF the home secretary is setting up an urgent review to consider how to improve death certification and make more effective the checks undertaken before cremation and burial. The review will also consider whether there should be a role for coroners in monitoring the proper procedures after death. The consideration and findings of this review will of course be made available to the inquiry I have announced today.</p> <p>Madam Speaker we owe it to the relatives and friends of those murdered by Harold Shipman to identify and to take whatever steps are necessary to prevent a repetition of the terrible events witnessed in Hyde.</p> <p>Harold Shipman was a determined serial killer. He preyed on some of the most vulnerable members of our society. He broke the trust of his patients in the most dreadful way imaginable. Having betrayed the trust of his own patients, Harold Shipman should not be allowed to break the vital bond of trust that exists between family doctors and their patients.</p> <p>The action I have outlined today is intended to strengthen that bond of trust. It expresses the government's determination to apply the lessons of the Shipman case to ensure that patients have the protection they deserve.</p>",

The families of Shipman's victims would be given the opportunity to have their say, he promised.</p> <p>The inquiry, to be chaired by Lord Laming of Tewin, a former chief inspector of social services, will consider the risks posed by doctors working in isolated single-handed medical practices and GPs' access to controlled drugs.</p> <p>Mr Milburn said police had investigated a total of 136 cases involving Shipman. \"He abused his position of trust in a way that was callous, systematic and determined,\" the health secretary said.</p> <p>\"The relationship between individual doctor and individual patient is built upon trust.

He urged the general medical council to give its \"most urgent attention\" to removing Shipman from the register of medical practitioners.</p> <p>Shipman was convicted yesterday of killing 15 women patients. Police believe he could have been responsible for up to 150 deaths.</p> <p>The general medical council had to be accountable to patient health, Mr Milburn said. Home secretary Jack Straw was setting up an urgent review of the system of death certification which would include the role of coroners. Hard-working GPs in this country should not have their bond of trust with their patients put at risk by the Shipman case, he said.</p> <p>Shadow health secretary Liam Fox, a former GP, said he felt \"horror and disgust\" at Shipman's actions. But he said Mr Milburn's statement had been \"well balanced\".</p> <p>\"It is Harold Shipman that has been found guilty, and not the medical profession and not GPs,\" Dr Fox said.</p> <p>The chairman of the British Medical Association, Dr Ian Bogle, called for regulations governing the issue of death certificates to be changed.</p> <p>\"What we need to do is speed up the work we are doing with government to make sure that clinical governance of general practice - the looking at how GPs' standards are in place and how patients' safety is guaranteed - is being got right,\" Dr Bogle said. \"Doing nothing is not an option. We do support an inquiry. Death certification must be part of the inquiry, as must the handling of drugs and the ability to get drugs in the way that Shipman did.\"</p> <p>New legislation has given the General Medical Council the power to act more decisively on the kind of information that it had on Shipman in the 1970s, and meant that a repeat of the case was less likely, he said.</p> <p>But Labour MP David Hinchliffe, the chairman of the House of Commons health select committee, said he was not so confident that the GMC was capable of acting in time to prevent future tragedies. \"There needs to be a much closer look at the role of the GMC,\" he said. \"I am not so convinced that the situation that happened in the 1970s could not be repeated.\"</p> <p>Last night the West Pennine health authority, which covers the area in which Shipman practised, suspended its medical adviser Dr Alan Banks and said an earlier investigation into Shipman, which took place in March 1998, would now be re-examined.</p> <p>During a 56-day trial, the jury heard how Shipman gave fatal morphine injections to 15 women aged between 49 and 81, including Kathleen Grundy, 81, on June 24, 1998.

      "bodyText": "An independent inquiry into all aspects of the Harold Shipman case was announced today by health secretary Alan Milburn. In a statement, Mr Milburn told a hushed House of Commons that the full report into the GP's murders would be completed by the autumn. The families of Shipman's victims would be given the opportunity to have their say, he promised. The inquiry, to be chaired by Lord Laming of Tewin, a former chief inspector of social services, will consider the risks posed by doctors working in isolated single-handed medical practices and GPs' access to controlled drugs. Mr Milburn said police had investigated a total of 136 cases involving Shipman. \"He abused his position of trust in a way that was callous, systematic and determined,\" the health secretary said. \"The relationship between individual doctor and individual patient is built upon trust. The Shipman case must not be allowed to erode the bond which rightly exists between our excellent family doctors and the families they serve\u0085 \"Having betrayed the trust of his own patients, Harold Shipman should not be allowed to break the vital bond of trust that exists between family doctors and their patients.\" But he also said: \"It is of course true that a determined criminal can defeat the best regulated organisation in pursuit of his purpose. But we must be confident that we do indeed have the best systems for regulation and self-regulation firmly in place. There is no doubt that those systems have to be strengthened and to be changed.\" Doctors will be required to disclose criminal convictions and action taken against them by a professional regulatory body before applying for appointment to medical lists. It will also become compulsory for GPs to report deaths in their surgeries and other serious incidents to health authorities. The chief medical officer is to oversee a clinical audit of Shipman's past practice, including the pattern of deaths, causes of deaths, prescription of restrictive drugs and relevant medical records. Mr Milburn also promised immediate moves to prevent Shipman being paid for another month and said he was considering whether to withhold the doctor's pension entitlement. He urged the general medical council to give its \"most urgent attention\" to removing Shipman from the register of medical practitioners. Shipman was convicted yesterday of killing 15 women patients. Police believe he could have been responsible for up to 150 deaths. The general medical council had to be accountable to patient health, Mr Milburn said. Home secretary Jack Straw was setting up an urgent review of the system of death certification which would include the role of coroners. Hard-working GPs in this country should not have their bond of trust with their patients put at risk by the Shipman case, he said. Shadow health secretary Liam Fox, a former GP, said he felt \"horror and disgust\" at Shipman's actions. But he said Mr Milburn's statement had been \"well balanced\". \"It is Harold Shipman that has been found guilty, and not the medical profession and not GPs,\" Dr Fox said. The chairman of the British Medical Association, Dr Ian Bogle, called for regulations governing the issue of death certificates to be changed. \"What we need to do is speed up the work we are doing with government to make sure that clinical governance of general practice - the looking at how GPs' standards are in place and how patients' safety is guaranteed - is being got right,\" Dr Bogle said. \"Doing nothing is not an option. We do support an inquiry. Death certification must be part of the inquiry, as must the handling of drugs and the ability to get drugs in the way that Shipman did.\" New legislation has given the General Medical Council the power to act more decisively on the kind of information that it had on Shipman in the 1970s, and meant that a repeat of the case was less likely, he said. But Labour MP David Hinchliffe, the chairman of the House of Commons health select committee, said he was not so confident that the GMC was capable of acting in time to prevent future tragedies. \"There needs to be a much closer look at the role of the GMC,\" he said. \"I am not so convinced that the situation that happened in the 1970s could not be repeated.\" Last night the West Pennine health authority, which covers the area in which Shipman practised, suspended its medical adviser Dr Alan Banks and said an earlier investigation into Shipman, which took place in March 1998, would now be re-examined. During a 56-day trial, the jury heard how Shipman gave fatal morphine injections to 15 women aged between 49 and 81, including Kathleen Grundy, 81, on June 24, 1998. In addition, he was sentenced to four years for forging widow Mrs Grundy's \u00a3386,000 will, an act which led to his downfall. Ann Alexander, a leading clinical negligence expert, praised the swift action taken by the government. Ms Alexander, a solicitor who led the campaign for an inquiry into the case of child killer nurse Beverley Allitt in the early 1990s, said she was impressed that an independent inquiry into the case had already been called. Ms Alexander, the managing partner of Cheshire-based Alexander Harris solicitors, said: \"The speed at which the government acted in this case is to be applauded. It took us months in Allitt to even get an inquiry.\" Ms Alexander said she believed the West Pennine health authority, which employed Shipman, would have a huge cost to shoulder. \"Compensation claims are not going to cripple the health authority but what is going to be enormous for them is the cost of the inquiry because it will be a long time,\" she said. \"The changes which will be implemented in the wake of this will also be costly, but this is going to apply across the country.\" As the authorities grappled with the questions how, the question why remained even more of a mystery. Detective chief inspector Mike Williams, who interviewed Shipman, said: \"He likes control, and the ultimate control is over life and death.\" Even after his conviction, Shipman's patients were incredulous at his fate. Juliette Clanford, 61, who said she had been his patient for 23 years said: \"I am very, very shocked by this whole thing, I really like doctor Shipman and I didn't think he was guilty.

Don't worry about it.\" Mr Dyke was careful to begin his speech by paying tribute to his predecessor's achievements, particularly the launch of the BBC's website, BBC Online, which he described as \"well ahead of the field\". In a later speech to an invited audience in Brussels, he described BBC Online as the most visited European web site, with 124 million hits a month. But he said it was up to organisations like the BBC to make sure people were \"digitally-literate\". He said it was vital that public sector broadcasters showed ordinary people how to gain quick access to new media opportunities by explaining the technology and processes involved on TV and radio. Mr Dyke argued that, as proliferating commercial channels were forced to rely ever more heavily on cheap US imports, public sector broadcasters would be best placed to make quality home-produced programmes. \"Viewers prefer indigenous programming to American programming, but of course American programming is much cheaper to buy and, in a world where there is going to be more and more channels, the danger is that no one commercial channel, or even group of channels, can afford to make the indigenous programming the audiences want.\"",

      "body": "<p>In 1994, Susie Duce gave birth to her second child, a little girl called Melissa. But almost as soon as she held her baby, Susie knew something was wrong. Melissa was, says Susie, floppy. \"She hardly moved. The doctors insisted she was fine, but I knew she wasn't. She couldn't even hold her head up at six weeks.\" </p> <p>Eventually, aged four months, the diagnosis came: Melissa had spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a rare genetic disorder that neither Susie, her husband Kevin, nor any family member had ever heard of. To their horror, Susie and Kevin discovered that they both happened to carry a recessive gene which means that any child they have together has a one-in-four chance of being affected by SMA. Many such babies die when they are only days old. Few live beyond a year. </p> <p>Melissa was nursed at home, 24 hours a day, by her parents. She died aged nine months. </p> <p>Last month, though, at St Thomas's hospital in London, Susie gave birth to Isobel, James and Kieran, all free of the SMA gene. The triplets were born thanks to a relatively new technique called preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). You've probably heard of PGD from headlines decrying \"designer babies\" or \"eugenics\". It's controversial because it involves the genetic testing of embryos before they are implanted in a woman's body, so as to screen out certain hereditary diseases. This may sound threatening, but as Susie puts it: \"PGD is only about having a 'designer baby' if 'designer' means one that lives.\" </p> <p>Concern about genetic manipulation is understandable. A couple of years ago we were panicking about cloned sheep and posthumous fathering. Last week, there was the furore over the news that women's eggs can now legally be frozen then defrosted for use years later. But PGD isn't about creating a blue-eyed super race. It is currently only used - in Britain, at least - to screen out specific, highly disabling (and usually lethal) disorders like SMA, cystic fibrosis and haemophilia. It can also help women like Tracy. Tracy has been trying for 10 years to have a baby. She had four miscarriages before doctors discovered that an abnormality in her chromosomes (a genetic condition called \"translocation\") means she'll either keep miscarrying, or have a severely disabled baby who will then die. Thanks to the centre for preimplantation genetic diagnosis at Guy's and St Thomas' hospital, Tracy is now 22 weeks pregnant - also, amazingly, with triplets. </p> <p>PGD does not involve any genetic alteration of embryos and is strictly regulated in Britain by the human fertilisation and embryology act. A treatment begins with IVF to generate and fertilise several eggs. One cell is then taken from each embryo a few days after fertilisation and tested to see whether it - and by extension the embryo itself - is free from the disorder. Three healthy embryos are then implanted in the woman's uterus (one or two usually won't take hold, so triplets aren't the norm). If all goes well, the result is a healthy child. </p> <p>The concept of testing a foetus for genetic disease, though controversial, is not new. Tests during a pregnancy - either amniocentesis, performed at 18 weeks or chorionic villus sampling, done at 12 weeks - have long been able to detect genetic disorders. So, both Susie and Tracy could have become pregnant naturally and chanced the outcome. Tracy would undoubtedly have miscarried before 12 weeks. Susie, though, could have undergone the tests (which themselves can cause miscarriage). If SMA had been found, she would have been offered a late abortion. Or she could have given birth and then watched her child die, as she did Melissa. Susie's response is understandable: \"Pregnancy was out of the question. We couldn't handle losing another child.\" She could have tried sperm or egg donation. Or adoption. Or she could have resigned herself to having no more children. Or there was PGD, available in only four clinics in Britain. </p> <p>Yvette and her husband Alfie face the same choice. In 1997, their son Callum died of SMA at 11 weeks. With eight healthy nephews and nieces, it didn't occur to Yvette that her baby would have anything wrong with it. \"When you hear you're having a baby, the last thing you expect is that it'll die,\" she says. In 1998 their daughter Georgia was stillborn, also with SMA. Yvette \"can't face losing another child\". So, she applied for funding from her health authority to try PGD. </p> <p>One cycle of the treatment at St Thomas's (which is not profit-making) costs \u00a32,500. But Yvette, like Susie before her, was told by her health authority that funding wasn't available. Susie had battled for two years for funding believing that \"if I didn't get it, no one else was going to\". Both health authorities mistakenly maintained that PGD was \"fertility treatment\". Both offered to pay for as many abortions as the women \"needed\". Both - eventually - paid up. Yvette and Susie hope that other health authorities will be less reluctant to fund PGD in future. </p> <p>More than 300 children have been born this way in 30 clinics world-wide since the technique was developed in the late 80s. And last week the team at St Thomas's were celebrating the birth of their eighth PGD baby since the programme began in 1997. \"Our high success rate,\" says Professor Peter Braude, director of the PGD programme, \"is down to close collaboration with geneticists at Guy's hospital, one of the largest departments in the country devoted to human genetics.\" Currently, 33% of women having one PGD treatment there become - and stay - pregnant. </p> <p>People who believe that life begins at conception will, of course, consider it unacceptable to screen embryos, whatever the reason. Many people living with hereditary diseases, or relatives who have them, also object to PGD on ethical grounds. But those who fear future abuse of these advances probably needn't worry. The human fertilisation and embryology authority (HFEA), the body that regulates PGD, has banned any non-medical uses. \"[We] do not think it would be acceptable to test for any social or psychological characteristics, normal physical variations or any other conditions which are not associated with disability or a serious medical condition,\" says Ruth Deech, who chairs HFEA. Furthermore, HFEA is currently circulating a document to ask us - the public - what we think of PGD. </p> <p>And, according to the experts, the notion of screening for intelligence is (and will be for the foreseeable future) a genetic impossibility. \"We have not even identified any of the principle genes responsible for intelligence,\" says Christine Gosden, professor of medical genetics at Liverpool university \"let alone been able to understand how they interact and then manipulate them.\" (Intelligence, apparently, results from the subtle interaction of more than 1,000 unknown genes). What's more, as prof Braude points out: \"If you were going to design babies, PGD would be an extremely inefficient way to do it.\" It would be pretty impossible to isolate specific, \"desirable\" characteristics from the few embryos that one person could produce. </p> <p>What PGD does offer, though, is the chance for women like Yvette, Susie and Tracy to have a baby who won't suffer from a fatal hereditary disease. Yvette's first cycle of treatment hasn't made her pregnant, but the medical team are optimistic about the next one. Yvette and Alfie, meanwhile, hope \"that it will be the answer to our prayers\". </p> <p>\u0095 For more information on PGD at St Thomas's, call Dr Helen Bickerstaff on 0171 960 5878.

The triplets were born thanks to a relatively new technique called preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). You've probably heard of PGD from headlines decrying \"designer babies\" or \"eugenics\". It's controversial because it involves the genetic testing of embryos before they are implanted in a woman's body, so as to screen out certain hereditary diseases. This may sound threatening, but as Susie puts it: \"PGD is only about having a 'designer baby' if 'designer' means one that lives.\" Concern about genetic manipulation is understandable. A couple of years ago we were panicking about cloned sheep and posthumous fathering. Last week, there was the furore over the news that women's eggs can now legally be frozen then defrosted for use years later. But PGD isn't about creating a blue-eyed super race. It is currently only used - in Britain, at least - to screen out specific, highly disabling (and usually lethal) disorders like SMA, cystic fibrosis and haemophilia. It can also help women like Tracy. Tracy has been trying for 10 years to have a baby. She had four miscarriages before doctors discovered that an abnormality in her chromosomes (a genetic condition called \"translocation\") means she'll either keep miscarrying, or have a severely disabled baby who will then die. Thanks to the centre for preimplantation genetic diagnosis at Guy's and St Thomas' hospital, Tracy is now 22 weeks pregnant - also, amazingly, with triplets. PGD does not involve any genetic alteration of embryos and is strictly regulated in Britain by the human fertilisation and embryology act. A treatment begins with IVF to generate and fertilise several eggs. One cell is then taken from each embryo a few days after fertilisation and tested to see whether it - and by extension the embryo itself - is free from the disorder. Three healthy embryos are then implanted in the woman's uterus (one or two usually won't take hold, so triplets aren't the norm). If all goes well, the result is a healthy child. The concept of testing a foetus for genetic disease, though controversial, is not new. Tests during a pregnancy - either amniocentesis, performed at 18 weeks or chorionic villus sampling, done at 12 weeks - have long been able to detect genetic disorders. So, both Susie and Tracy could have become pregnant naturally and chanced the outcome. Tracy would undoubtedly have miscarried before 12 weeks. Susie, though, could have undergone the tests (which themselves can cause miscarriage). If SMA had been found, she would have been offered a late abortion. Or she could have given birth and then watched her child die, as she did Melissa. Susie's response is understandable: \"Pregnancy was out of the question. We couldn't handle losing another child.\" She could have tried sperm or egg donation. Or adoption. Or she could have resigned herself to having no more children. Or there was PGD, available in only four clinics in Britain. Yvette and her husband Alfie face the same choice. In 1997, their son Callum died of SMA at 11 weeks. With eight healthy nephews and nieces, it didn't occur to Yvette that her baby would have anything wrong with it. \"When you hear you're having a baby, the last thing you expect is that it'll die,\" she says. In 1998 their daughter Georgia was stillborn, also with SMA. Yvette \"can't face losing another child\". So, she applied for funding from her health authority to try PGD. One cycle of the treatment at St Thomas's (which is not profit-making) costs \u00a32,500. But Yvette, like Susie before her, was told by her health authority that funding wasn't available. Susie had battled for two years for funding believing that \"if I didn't get it, no one else was going to\". Both health authorities mistakenly maintained that PGD was \"fertility treatment\". Both offered to pay for as many abortions as the women \"needed\". Both - eventually - paid up. Yvette and Susie hope that other health authorities will be less reluctant to fund PGD in future. More than 300 children have been born this way in 30 clinics world-wide since the technique was developed in the late 80s. And last week the team at St Thomas's were celebrating the birth of their eighth PGD baby since the programme began in 1997. \"Our high success rate,\" says Professor Peter Braude, director of the PGD programme, \"is down to close collaboration with geneticists at Guy's hospital, one of the largest departments in the country devoted to human genetics.\" Currently, 33% of women having one PGD treatment there become - and stay - pregnant. People who believe that life begins at conception will, of course, consider it unacceptable to screen embryos, whatever the reason. Many people living with hereditary diseases, or relatives who have them, also object to PGD on ethical grounds. But those who fear future abuse of these advances probably needn't worry. The human fertilisation and embryology authority (HFEA), the body that regulates PGD, has banned any non-medical uses. \"[We] do not think it would be acceptable to test for any social or psychological characteristics, normal physical variations or any other conditions which are not associated with disability or a serious medical condition,\" says Ruth Deech, who chairs HFEA. Furthermore, HFEA is currently circulating a document to ask us - the public - what we think of PGD. And, according to the experts, the notion of screening for intelligence is (and will be for the foreseeable future) a genetic impossibility. \"We have not even identified any of the principle genes responsible for intelligence,\" says Christine Gosden, professor of medical genetics at Liverpool university \"let alone been able to understand how they interact and then manipulate them.\" (Intelligence, apparently, results from the subtle interaction of more than 1,000 unknown genes). What's more, as prof Braude points out: \"If you were going to design babies, PGD would be an extremely inefficient way to do it.\" It would be pretty impossible to isolate specific, \"desirable\" characteristics from the few embryos that one person could produce. What PGD does offer, though, is the chance for women like Yvette, Susie and Tracy to have a baby who won't suffer from a fatal hereditary disease. Yvette's first cycle of treatment hasn't made her pregnant, but the medical team are optimistic about the next one. Yvette and Alfie, meanwhile, hope \"that it will be the answer to our prayers\". \u0095 For more information on PGD at St Thomas's, call Dr Helen Bickerstaff on 0171 960 5878.

He suffers from aches and pains in the joints, particularly in his wrists and ankles. I was wondering what dietary recommendations there may be to help with arthritis/rheumatism - I've read that oily fish may be beneficial. </p> <p><strong>A</strong> Your dad is most likely to be suffering from osteoarthritis, which is wear and tear of the joints that affects most of us as we get older. He should try to lose weight if he's overweight to take pressure off his knees, ankles and back. Unfortunately, there is no good evidence that oily fish or any other kind of dietary supplement really help in osteoarthritis, though they do in rheumatoid arthritis. </p> <p>Paracetamol in quite high doses (up to eight tablets or 4g a day) is best for pain relief. If they aren't strong enough, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as Brufen are worth a try but may cause side effects of indigestion, bruising, even stomach ulcers. If his joints swell up, fluid can be drained by the GP to give relief. Injection of steroids into the joint may help. There's hope that injections of hyaluronic acid into arthritic knees will protect the cartilage and relieve pain. </p> <p>Only joint specialists or rheumatologists offer this treatment. Physiotherapists can help improve joint movements. An occupational therapist can visit to suggest aids and hoists that will help him cope better and avoid falls. Using a stick and replacing thin-soled shoes with cushioned trainers can make a huge difference. An appointment with an orthopaedic surgeon to discuss surgical options may also be useful. </p> <p><strong>Antidepressants </strong></p> <p><strong>Q</strong> About 10 years ago I was prescribed an antidepressant, amitriptyline, which I have been using ever since. When I enquired about side effects I was told there were none. A few days ago I was looking through a medical book and was horrified to discover that there was a list half a page long - including heart and blood problems and impotence. Are these effects reversible if I stop using the medicine? </p> <p><strong>A</strong> If you were to read the potential side effects, you'd probably flush any prescribed drug down the loo. Of course, you do need to take note of the warnings. A frank discussion with a pharmacist is a good way of getting an informed perspective. </p> <p>Amitriptyline is effective and safe, so long as you don't overdose on it. Its side effects are largely predictable: it tends to make you tired, but that can be a good thing given that you usually take it at night and that sleep disturbance is often a feature of depression; if you suffer from heart disease, glaucoma or prostate trouble, you probably shouldn't be on it. </p> <p><strong>Baldness and hormones </strong></p> <p><strong>Q</strong> For the last four years my hair has been thinning at the sides and top and my hairline has been receding. My blood tests have been normal, but my doctor refuses to check my hormone levels as my periods have been OK. However, I have read that female baldness/hair loss can be caused by an increase in the level of testosterone. Have you any advice? </p> <p><strong>A</strong> Your hair loss sounds like it is the type known as male pattern baldness. In men, this is linked to the male hormones, androgens. In women, it is unclear whether hormones play a part. It's often an inherited tendency. The most practical solution is to take the oral contraceptive pill, Dianette, which blocks the male hormones and so can help prevent further hair loss. </p> <p>If you can't take the pill because you've had a thrombosis or you prefer not to, you could try Minoxidil lotion, marketed as Regaine, available over the counter. You have to keep using it or any hair regrowth tends to fall out again. If you are approaching the menopause then you may want to consider HRT which may restore hair thickness and halt the process. A blood test won't tell you much but can let you know whether you're approaching the menopause despite regular periods. I'd go for Dianette myself. </p> <p><strong>Facial veins</strong></p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I'm in my late 20s, and I've begun to get fine thread veins on my cheeks. They're not too bad at the moment, but the probability that they are going to get worse is worrying. Is there anything I can do to stop them getting worse (and possibly remove the ones I already have)? </p> <p><strong>A</strong> Tiny thread veins in the cheeks come on with age and sunbathing makes them worse. Rosacea, a skin condition causing facial flushing and tiny pustules, can result in lots of thread veins, as can prolonged steroid treatment. But most of us just get a few tiny ones on the cheeks, starting in our late 20s, and increasing with age. You can get them treated with a pulsatile laser by a dermatologist or cosmetic surgeon. One treatment is usually enough. You'll never get it done on the NHS unless it's due to rosacea or steroids because it will be deemed a cosmetic procedure. Expect to pay at least \u00a3175 for consultation and one-off treatment. </p> <p>\u0095 These answers are intended to be as accurate and full as possible, but should never be used as a substitute for visiting a doctor and seeking medical help.

      "bodyText": "After a series of false starts, engineering problems and all-too-public delays, the \u00a335 million Millennium Wheel was finally up and running today - and the first passengers were unequivocally enthusiastic. From some 450ft above London in nine-tonne capsules, the select few enjoyed unprecedented views of the capital's landmarks and beyond, to the rim of the Home Counties. Overcast conditions failed to spoil the day out for the passengers - competition winners who would have travelled on New Year's Eve until a clutch problem on one of the capsules led to a postponement of the wheel's opening. Jenny Walker, from Croydon, south London, said: \"It was unbelievable. Even on a relatively poor day for visibility we had wonderful views over London. It was just magnificent.\" Another competition winner, Suzanne Blackford, from Mitcham, Surrey, with her two children, even promised: \"I shall come back again and pay to go on.\" The 2,100-tonne wheel - officially called the British Airways London Eye - stands on the south bank of the Thames opposite the Houses of Parliament. When the wheel opens for business, adults will have to pay \u00a37.45 for the 30-minute ride. One of the first to take a ride today was British Airways chief executive Bob Ayling. Mr Ayling said: \"Now the wheel is finally opening with people on it, I am very happy indeed\" - and no doubt relieved that BA's massive underwriting of the project appears finally to be heading for public relations success. BA has planning permission for the wheel for five years but it is expected that the attraction could become a permanent feature. The wheel should have opened around the third week of January but the clutch problem meant the public opening was put back, first to the beginning of February and then until the beginning of March. Last year, the dragging of the wheel from a flat position on the Thames into its upright stance was delayed for four weeks after a supporting cable snapped. There are 32 passenger-carrying capsules on the wheel and each can take up to 25 passengers. This means that there can be as many as 800 passengers on the wheel at any one time and the giant structure can cater for 15,000 passengers a day. BA hopes to accommodate 2.5 million passengers in the first year of operation, although independent research suggests as many as four million could take rides. More than 600,000 tickets have already been sold and BA is also offering a turn-up-and-go service for people on the day. The wheel is open from 9am until 6pm until April 1 and then summer opening times of 9am until 10pm come into effect until the beginning of October. Tickets cost \u00a37.45 for adults, \u00a35.95 for senior citizens, and \u00a34.95 for children, with under-5s going free.",

      "bodyText": "European Union members entered uncharted political waters last night by threatening to boycott Austria if J\u00f6rg Haider's far-right Freedom party joins a new government. Portugal, the current holder of the EU's rotating presidency, issued an unprecedented statement saying that all member states, with the obvious exception of Austria, would refuse all bilateral contacts with Vienna if that happened. Risking charges of interfering in the internal affairs of a member state, the 14 acted outside the EU, which has no constitutional mechanism for issuing such threats - though it could, theoretically, act later. The members also served notice they they would not back any Austrian candidate seeking a position with an international organisation and that Austrian ambassadors would only be received in EU capitals \"at a technical level\". In a move reflecting deep concern across Europe about legitimising the sort of extremism espoused by Mr Haider, Portugal said it had told Austria \"there would be no business as usual\" in bilateral relations with a government that included the Freedom party. \"If a party which has expressed xenophobic views, and which does not abide by the essential values of the European family, comes to power, naturally we won't be able to continue the same relations as in the past, however much we regret it,\" said the Portuguese prime minister, Antonio Guterres. \"Nothing will be as before.\" The move was designed to exert maximum pressure on Austria's foreign minister, the conservative People's party leader, Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel, who is negotiating with Mr Haider on forming a coalition government. Mr Guterres said he had expressed the fears of EU members to other Austrian political leaders. \"I hope [Haider's participation] can be avoided,\" he said. Alarm has been rising in EU capitals over the past few days. Austria was the main point of discussion when the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, met his French, German and Italian colleagues last Thursday for what should have been a meeting about the Balkans. The prime minister, Tony Blair, backed the EU's drive to signal its dismay at a right-wing extremist joining a coalition in Vienna that would \"have a bearing on discussions in the EU\". Downing Street hopes to steer the coalition negotiations away from Mr Haider and his party. Though the EU 14 have no collective ability to intervene, they are coordinating their responses. \"In the end, the domestic political situation is for the Austrians to resolve,\" Mr Blair's spokesman said, but Mr Haider's views could not be ignored, as they \"offended\" the EU's \"system of principles\". Momentum for action began building at the end of last week and Belgium's foreign minister, Louis Michel, exchanged abuse with Mr Haider over the weekend. Mr Michel said yesterday that the Freedom party leader was a \"dangerous man\". \"Europe must know that if Haider gains a place in government the extreme right will cease to be something out of the ordinary. That would be a very serious precedent,\" he told Le Soir newspaper. Hubert Vedrine, the French foreign minister, warned that Franco-Austrian relations faced a \"difficult phase\" if the Freedom party joined a ruling coalition, adding that he found the movement's political platform \"repugnant\". \"Europe is no longer in the 1930s. It has mechanisms which allow a state to be suspended [from the EU] if found guilty of constant, serious human rights violations - but we are still far from any such situation,\" Mr Vedrine told France-Inter radio. \"What we want is for them to give up [bringing the Freedom party into government]. But if they don't, then Austria will be under surveillance as no country has ever been in the European Union.\" Under the EU's 1997 Amsterdam treaty, a member state can be suspended if heads of government decide that it is in \"serious and persistent breach\" of the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. But under the bilateral moves threatened yesterday, Austria could continue to take part in all official EU events. Austrian leaders were said last night to be stunned by the move, which came amid continuing negotiations in Vienna over the formation of a new government led by the People's party. Mr Haider said last night that the EU was showing a lack of respect for democracy. \"I am somewhat appalled at the lack of seriousness with which people take democracy in a country like Austria which has made a clear electoral choice,\" he told ORF television, adding that Austria should not bow to the pressure.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>As the home secretary, Jack Straw occupies the one heavyweight job in the Cabinet which breaks far more politicians than it makes. Most home secretaries last only a couple of years at most in the job as they are worn down by the repeated, but unpredictable, volcanic eruptions that constantly threaten to engulf them. Few go on to greater things.</p> <p>Compared with his predecessor Michael Howard, Mr Straw enjoyed a relatively trouble free first 18 months in the job. There were none of the escapes of IRA prisoners or armed robbers from maximum security jails or high level sackings of prisons directors that troubled his Tory predecessor. His actions have yet to provoke the entire legal establishment, the police and the rest of the criminal justice system into open revolt against him. \"He hasn't really been tested,\" said senior Whitehall civil servants when asked how they thought Straw was getting on.</p> <p>Well, if that was the case, then the new year has certainly finally put Straw through the mill. His decisions to send Pinochet back to Chile, to allow Mike Tyson into Britain despite his rape convictions, to deport a Nazi war criminal and the big battles with the house of lords over his plans to restrict the right to jury trial and extend the race relations laws all combined to give him his toughest time yet. Jack Straw has had to put into practice Labour's famous 'tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime' catchphrase first developed in opposition by Tony Blair when he was the shadow home secretary.</p> <p>The authoritarian edge to his 'crusade against crime' - whether in developing child curfews, anti-social behaviour orders, or pressing ahead with child jails and private prisons - has infuriated his critics on what he attacks as the 'liberal left'. He claims that the 'Hampstead liberals' he vilifies for attacking his Daily Mail knee-jerk response to law and order have no interest in protecting the civil rights of those who are victims of the burglars and vandals on Britain's worst run-down inner city estates. Although crime is once again going up his approach has left his personal popularity ratings above even those of Tony Blair.</p> <p>He has thrived on the pressure: \"I have no complaints at all. I sleep well. I eat well and I go to the gym regularly,\" he replied when he was asked if he wasn't having a hard time.</p> <p>Yet at times it seems this ex-Islington councillor and former 1960s radical student leader who still makes jokes about 'dialectical materialism' has a love-hate relationship with those he claims to despise. He will often say that his proudest achievement to date is the incorporation of the European Convention of Human Rights into British law, which will spark a civil liberties revolution in our courts later this year. His record on racism, particularly in ordering the Stephen Lawrence inquiry, and ensuring that Whitehall and the police confront the racism in their ranks has been applauded even by his critics.</p> <p>But his now famous lack of generosity in his approach to freedom of information, to trial by jury, and in the treatment of asylum seekers, as well as his tough policy on drugs have all angered his Labour and Liberal critics. Unlike many of his cabinet colleagues though, Jack Straw rarely shrinks from taking on his critics in open debate. Whether it is his regular spots on his soapbox outside Marks and Spencer's in his Blackburn constituency or on the Guardian Unlimited network, you can expect a straight answer however direct the question.</p>",

      "bodyText": "As the home secretary, Jack Straw occupies the one heavyweight job in the Cabinet which breaks far more politicians than it makes. Most home secretaries last only a couple of years at most in the job as they are worn down by the repeated, but unpredictable, volcanic eruptions that constantly threaten to engulf them. Few go on to greater things. Compared with his predecessor Michael Howard, Mr Straw enjoyed a relatively trouble free first 18 months in the job. There were none of the escapes of IRA prisoners or armed robbers from maximum security jails or high level sackings of prisons directors that troubled his Tory predecessor. His actions have yet to provoke the entire legal establishment, the police and the rest of the criminal justice system into open revolt against him. \"He hasn't really been tested,\" said senior Whitehall civil servants when asked how they thought Straw was getting on. Well, if that was the case, then the new year has certainly finally put Straw through the mill. His decisions to send Pinochet back to Chile, to allow Mike Tyson into Britain despite his rape convictions, to deport a Nazi war criminal and the big battles with the house of lords over his plans to restrict the right to jury trial and extend the race relations laws all combined to give him his toughest time yet. Jack Straw has had to put into practice Labour's famous 'tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime' catchphrase first developed in opposition by Tony Blair when he was the shadow home secretary. The authoritarian edge to his 'crusade against crime' - whether in developing child curfews, anti-social behaviour orders, or pressing ahead with child jails and private prisons - has infuriated his critics on what he attacks as the 'liberal left'. He claims that the 'Hampstead liberals' he vilifies for attacking his Daily Mail knee-jerk response to law and order have no interest in protecting the civil rights of those who are victims of the burglars and vandals on Britain's worst run-down inner city estates. Although crime is once again going up his approach has left his personal popularity ratings above even those of Tony Blair. He has thrived on the pressure: \"I have no complaints at all. I sleep well. I eat well and I go to the gym regularly,\" he replied when he was asked if he wasn't having a hard time. Yet at times it seems this ex-Islington councillor and former 1960s radical student leader who still makes jokes about 'dialectical materialism' has a love-hate relationship with those he claims to despise. He will often say that his proudest achievement to date is the incorporation of the European Convention of Human Rights into British law, which will spark a civil liberties revolution in our courts later this year. His record on racism, particularly in ordering the Stephen Lawrence inquiry, and ensuring that Whitehall and the police confront the racism in their ranks has been applauded even by his critics. But his now famous lack of generosity in his approach to freedom of information, to trial by jury, and in the treatment of asylum seekers, as well as his tough policy on drugs have all angered his Labour and Liberal critics. Unlike many of his cabinet colleagues though, Jack Straw rarely shrinks from taking on his critics in open debate. Whether it is his regular spots on his soapbox outside Marks and Spencer's in his Blackburn constituency or on the Guardian Unlimited network, you can expect a straight answer however direct the question.",

      "body": "<b>What checks are there on doctors?</b> <br> Deaths in GPs' surgeries have to be reported to the coroner. Cremation certificates require the signature of a second doctor. <p><b>What are the limitations on the current system? </b><br> In general, doctors in single-handed practices like Harold Shipman can operate pretty much independently. There are 2,847 single-handed practices in England and Wales. There was no official way the health authority could have known about the high death rate among Shipman's elderly women patients, or that he had stockpiled huge quantities of diamorphine (although they were aware of the high cost of his overall drug budget and met him regularly to discuss that). Doctors do not have to keep records of drugs they obtain from pharmacists and administer directly to patients. They are expected to destroy unused drugs handed over by relatives when a patient dies - but they are not legally required to do so. There is no legal requirement for doctors to notify a coroner in the event of a sudden or unexplained death. Shipman was able to cover his tracks by signing death certificates. When a patient dies at home, there are no automatic checks on the certificate. When the patient is elderly and the cause is convincing, coroners are reluctant to prolong a family's grief by investigating that.</p> <p>The General Medical Council was not required to tell Shipman's health authority that he had a previous conviction for misusing drugs.</p> <p> <b>Why did it take so long to catch him? </b><br> Shipman was careful to share out requests for other doctors to sign cremation certificates. He had a friendly manner and was trusted by his patients. When alerted by a suspicious GP who was concerned by the number of cremation certificates she was asked to sign, police were slow to act. They failed to check for any criminal record - he was convicted of obtaining drugs by deception and forgery in 1976 - failed to link up with the General Medical Council, and initially failed to discover that Shipman had tampered with computerised records of his patients. </p> <p><b>What is being done to improve the system? </b><br> Health secretary Alan Milburn is today announcing an inquiry into the deaths. The chief medical officer, Liam Donaldson, issued a consultation document in November on a new system of audit and appraisal of doctors. Health authorities would have the power to suspend doctors if it was suspected they could be a danger to their patients.

      "bodyText": "What checks are there on doctors? Deaths in GPs' surgeries have to be reported to the coroner. Cremation certificates require the signature of a second doctor. What are the limitations on the current system? In general, doctors in single-handed practices like Harold Shipman can operate pretty much independently. There are 2,847 single-handed practices in England and Wales. There was no official way the health authority could have known about the high death rate among Shipman's elderly women patients, or that he had stockpiled huge quantities of diamorphine (although they were aware of the high cost of his overall drug budget and met him regularly to discuss that). Doctors do not have to keep records of drugs they obtain from pharmacists and administer directly to patients. They are expected to destroy unused drugs handed over by relatives when a patient dies - but they are not legally required to do so. There is no legal requirement for doctors to notify a coroner in the event of a sudden or unexplained death. Shipman was able to cover his tracks by signing death certificates. When a patient dies at home, there are no automatic checks on the certificate. When the patient is elderly and the cause is convincing, coroners are reluctant to prolong a family's grief by investigating that. The General Medical Council was not required to tell Shipman's health authority that he had a previous conviction for misusing drugs. Why did it take so long to catch him? Shipman was careful to share out requests for other doctors to sign cremation certificates. He had a friendly manner and was trusted by his patients. When alerted by a suspicious GP who was concerned by the number of cremation certificates she was asked to sign, police were slow to act. They failed to check for any criminal record - he was convicted of obtaining drugs by deception and forgery in 1976 - failed to link up with the General Medical Council, and initially failed to discover that Shipman had tampered with computerised records of his patients. What is being done to improve the system? Health secretary Alan Milburn is today announcing an inquiry into the deaths. The chief medical officer, Liam Donaldson, issued a consultation document in November on a new system of audit and appraisal of doctors. Health authorities would have the power to suspend doctors if it was suspected they could be a danger to their patients. But some doctors fear the restrictions would limit their powers too far. The government is also suggesting \"smart cards\" for every health service employer indicating details of their previous record. A commission for health improvement is planning to inspect every GPs' surgery. The West Pennine health authority has suspended its medical adviser, Dr Alan Banks, \"to make it easier to investigate past concerns about Shipman\". What further improvements are being suggested? Angela Woodruff, who alerted the police after her mother was murdered and her will forged, said a second doctor should sign all death certificates after checking medical records. The West Pennine health authority says GPs should be prevented from writing prescriptions for the terminally ill or take drugs from dead patients. The supply of controlled drugs to GPs should be more carefully monitored. Second doctors asked to sign cremation certificate should check medical notes against the cause of death, check the bodies of patients and when possible speak to relatives to confirm the cause. It says surgery computer systems should be set up to prevent records being backdated and a whistleblowers. Ian Bogle, the chairman of the British Medical Association said today doctors and coroners should be given computer training to spot unusual trends in records. The BMA wants clearer definitions of the types of deaths which coroners are required to investigate. But it said in a statement: \"It is important to acknowledge that it is difficult to conceive of any set of laws or regulations that could have prevented the offences of which Harold Shipman has been convicted.\" Useful link British Medical Association",

      "body": "<p>Smart gallery, bright lights, big paintings. The Anthony d'Offay Gallery is hung with portraits of young mums with their babies, someone with a Yorkshire terrier under each arm, a New Zealand women's rugby team and two group portraits of schoolkids. The paintings have titles like We Are Family, Equal Opportunities and Community Association, and they are loosely based on photographs from newspapers and magazines.</p> <p> They are painted with a rumbustuous panache - or, looked at another way, with a gauche lack of sophistication. One moment you think they are truly terrible, the next you are won over by their high-key colour, their gawky, wonky drawing. The oil paint is slapped and slicked on and pawed about at speed, to overcome the inertia and intractability of the medium. The artist has a problem with ears, eyes, noses and hands; hair seems to be made from marmalade or foam rubber. The dogs look like Gnasher from the Beano. </p> <p>It must be the paintings of Martin Maloney. When everything is a problem, it begins to turn into a style, and after a while you get used to it. The awkwardness begins to have a kind of emotional tenor and expressiveness. All the figures are painted as individuals; each one is a problem to be resolved. No one is a cipher, and Maloney tries to give his subjects a character, a singular demeanour and poise. Sometimes the results are laughable, but you also find yourself laughing with him. </p> <p>There's nothing new in this clownish tightrope walk, but it is quite compelling to watch. You want the artist to fail and fall, but at the same time you're even more pleased when he doesn't. Maloney's work may not be saying anything terribly deep, but then watching someone wallowing in profundity can be embarrassing. It isn't given to every writer or artist to be able to articulate the riddle of life. </p> <p>Maloney gained some notoriety for his Sex Club paintings in Saatchi's New Neurotic Realism show last year, but the big question was not so much their outr\u00e9 subject matter - scenes of fuck-rooms, desolate, anonymous sex and nocturnal escapades in the bushes - as their heroic ineptitude. Maloney's presence here, in the same gallery that sells work by substantial figures such as Gerhard Richter, Joseph Beuys, Rachel Whiteread and, currently in another part of the gallery, Gwen John, isn't just some kind of awful lapse, unlike d'Offay's show last year of sculptor Ron Mueck. Instead, it just feels a little premature. It may even be cynical - but dealers are dealers. </p> <p>Maloney talks about his work in terms of \"an expressive painted language\", and a daring to aspire to the \"wildness and restraint\" of Willem de Kooning and Francis Bacon. He also gives a shout for Jean Edouard Vuillard, Richard Dadd (the Victorian fairy painter), Georg Baselitz, Vasili Kandinsky, Franz Marc and Ian Davenport's poured paintings, as though to name-drop his way into the pantheon. But he also, tellingly, talks about Pedro Almodovar and Alan Bennett, and you sort of know what he's getting at.</p> <p> The difference is that Maloney's paintings aspire to more than they achieve. Still, at least he isn't worthy in the way so many British painters are, or afflicted with that awful combination of the three Bs - Baselitz, Basquiat and Bullshit. Maloney \"joked to a friend that I was painting men I wanted to fuck and girls I wanted to be. The more I paint, the more I am learning about my fantasies and the reality of who I am and who I want to be.\" At least he'd like to be himself, whoever that is, and the bullshit is worn lightly. </p> <p>Hype, self-promotion and the market clearly have a lot to do with an artist's visibility, and need to be disentangled from whatever merits the art might have on its own account. Julian Stallabrass's new book, High Art Lite, attempts to unpick the larger social forces at work in the now decade-long enthusiasm for new British art. High Art Lite may at first appear to be an apt description of Maloney's paintings, and indeed his paintings are used as illustrations, and his writings are quoted at some length in the book. </p> <p>One of the larger questions raised in Stallabrass's book is what, precisely, so much of contemporary, young British art is saying, beyond its appeal to popular culture, its cosying up to advertising, to tabloid and soap culture, and most importantly to Charles Saatchi. \"For Martin Maloney,\" Stallabras says, \"who owns up to 'playing with shallowness', making childishly sweet and banal figure paintings, it is not that the work comments on the media, but that the media has made the work and its author what they are.\" </p> <p>Stallabrass asks whether \"YBA\" art is truly popular, and in some way anti-elitist, or in fact plays into the hands of market forces, and buoys up a culture that is more divisive than inclusive on just about every level. Once, he says, he hoped that the public might eventually come to believe in contemporary art. </p> <p>But I get the feeling he now thinks that, like New Labour's third way, it is all a sham and its popularity over the past 10 years a terrible mistake. Stallabrass, a Marxist, regards the \"wallowing in abjection\" of certain strands of Britart, such as the work of Richard Billingham, as a cynical exploitation of the \"lumpen underclass\". Maloney, on the other hand, regards his own paintings as \"enjoying the ordinariness of people\". \"In culture, the working-class single mother is usually seen as a victim plagued with social problems. I wanted to paint the opposite of that,\" he says of one of the new works. </p> <p>Stallabrass seems alienated from the labour of his fellow workers. His problem, as a critic and an analyst, is that, like many Courtauld Institute-trained art historians, he's curiously disengaged when it comes to discussing the things artists actually make. He comes on like an auditor, balancing the books between the artist's stated intentions and the things they produce, which he tends to read as documents. There's a deadness about his expositions that makes me wonder whether he actually likes art. But no - he's far too serious to like things, and is more interested in \"taking on the art world as a whole, showing how it is thoroughly entangled with the society, its economy and politics\". This is laudable, but I think that's what he'd like artists to do too. </p> <p>Stallabrass wants us to smell the whiff of corruption. The book drags along, even when he has good points to make, and leans too heavily on secondary sources and quotations (another trait of the historian), rather than returning to the things artists make and do. Most of the artists he does seem to approve of - Michael Landy, Tomoko Takahashi, Angela Bulloch - are to my mind a trifle dull. But then again, I always thought John Berger frequently got art woefully wrong too, though in other respects he is an inspiring writer. Stallabrass criticises artists for not achieving what they never set out to do in the first place, or for achieving the wrong thing, and this always leads to terrible misjudgments. </p> <p>Stallabrass's book, with Jake and Dinos Chapman on the pink-edged cover, and a layout that owes a lot to Matthew Collings's Blimey and This Is Modern Art, might be mistaken for yet another breezy commentary on the last decade of hot Britart. But the pop look disguises a dense, somewhat smug and holier-than-thou critique. Stallabrass wants to occupy the high ground. \"The artists of the Saatchi collection,\" he writes, \"have finally made a very smooth ride for themselves.\" Most of the ones who are any good, I believe, are troubled by doubt, and are ambitious for their art. The rest will rightly be forgotten. </p> <p>Stallabrass says that Maloney's painting \"can stand as an emblem for the movement. It looks critical but the teeth of its gears have no purchase and spin in the air.\" Maloney's paintings might simplify what they engage with, but they're not simple-minded. They reach for affect and want to be filled with life and to communicate a kind of enthusiasm and empathy and humour. This seems to me to be worthwhile, and one of the better reasons to spend all those hours in the studio. </p> <p>Martin Maloney is at Anthony d'Offay, London W1 (0171-499 4100) till March 11. High Art Lite by Julian Stallabrass is published by Verso at \u00a322.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The director, producer and stars of The End of the Affair yesterday accused the censor of double standards after it was given an 18 certificate when a film they felt was misogynistic was passed as suitable for 15-year-olds. </p> <p>Ralph Fiennes and Julianne Moore, the stars of the adaptation of the Graham Greene novel, joined with the director Neil Jordan and producer Stephen Woolley to heighten the row over the 18 certificate given by the British Board of Film Classification because it contains a screen simulation of wartime lovers having a fling. </p> <p>The decision means that 16- and 17-year-olds, entitled to marry, have sex, and drive a car, cannot watch the film, which opens next Friday and which has been tipped as Britain's best chance of an Oscar. The New York Times and the film industry bible Variety have called it \"the best Graham Greene adaptation since the Third Man\". </p> <p>American teenagers can see the film so long as they are accompanied by an adult. In Ireland, notoriously censorious, the film got a 15 certificate. </p> <p>Mr Woolley said that the decision was shocking, particularly when the sex scenes were very short and not particularly graphic. He compared the classification to the 15 certificate given to Peter Greenaway's 8 Women, which was criticised for being misogynistic and used posters which \"hinted at anal sex\". </p> <p>He said: \"There's nothing in our film except for a bit of bottom. In the love-making scene they said there was too much movement from Ralph. In the second love-making scene they are semi-clothed. </p> <p>\"There is a double standard operating in that violence has become acceptable on screen. It's OK to show your children explicit violence like in the Bond films where we have murder, mayhem and death. And then we have a scene of making love and they are not allowed to see it.\" </p> <p>Mr Woolley said there was probably about two or three minutes of nudity in the whole film and the censors had advised that they be left uncut. </p> <p>Mr Fiennes said: \"In this particular instance I think it's absurd, completely absurd. I don't think the sexuality in it is sadistic or abusive or based on violence. It's mutually consenting adults making love which is why we are all here.\" </p> <p>Ms Moore said the film was not lascivious, her grandparents had seen it, love scenes and all, and approved. \"They were not upset at all,\" she said. </p> <p>Mr Jordan said: \"I think they should publish those guidelines so that we know how to have sex ourselves.\" </p> <p>The BBFC defended its decisions yesterday saying the sex scenes in the film were too strong. Spokeswoman Sue Clark said: \"The sex scenes in it are not permissible at 15 because of the nature of the sex.\" </p> <p>She added that the guidelines would soon be going out to consultation to see if the board was still in touch with the public. </p> <p>The End of the Affair was previously filmed in 1954.

      "bodyText": "The director, producer and stars of The End of the Affair yesterday accused the censor of double standards after it was given an 18 certificate when a film they felt was misogynistic was passed as suitable for 15-year-olds. Ralph Fiennes and Julianne Moore, the stars of the adaptation of the Graham Greene novel, joined with the director Neil Jordan and producer Stephen Woolley to heighten the row over the 18 certificate given by the British Board of Film Classification because it contains a screen simulation of wartime lovers having a fling. The decision means that 16- and 17-year-olds, entitled to marry, have sex, and drive a car, cannot watch the film, which opens next Friday and which has been tipped as Britain's best chance of an Oscar. The New York Times and the film industry bible Variety have called it \"the best Graham Greene adaptation since the Third Man\". American teenagers can see the film so long as they are accompanied by an adult. In Ireland, notoriously censorious, the film got a 15 certificate. Mr Woolley said that the decision was shocking, particularly when the sex scenes were very short and not particularly graphic. He compared the classification to the 15 certificate given to Peter Greenaway's 8 Women, which was criticised for being misogynistic and used posters which \"hinted at anal sex\". He said: \"There's nothing in our film except for a bit of bottom. In the love-making scene they said there was too much movement from Ralph. In the second love-making scene they are semi-clothed. \"There is a double standard operating in that violence has become acceptable on screen. It's OK to show your children explicit violence like in the Bond films where we have murder, mayhem and death. And then we have a scene of making love and they are not allowed to see it.\" Mr Woolley said there was probably about two or three minutes of nudity in the whole film and the censors had advised that they be left uncut. Mr Fiennes said: \"In this particular instance I think it's absurd, completely absurd. I don't think the sexuality in it is sadistic or abusive or based on violence. It's mutually consenting adults making love which is why we are all here.\" Ms Moore said the film was not lascivious, her grandparents had seen it, love scenes and all, and approved. \"They were not upset at all,\" she said. Mr Jordan said: \"I think they should publish those guidelines so that we know how to have sex ourselves.\" The BBFC defended its decisions yesterday saying the sex scenes in the film were too strong. Spokeswoman Sue Clark said: \"The sex scenes in it are not permissible at 15 because of the nature of the sex.\" She added that the guidelines would soon be going out to consultation to see if the board was still in touch with the public. The End of the Affair was previously filmed in 1954. The new version has had rave reviews in the United States. The New York Times called it intoxicating and critics pronounced it Jordan's best film. Nudity and film certificates 15 certificate Nudity There are no constraints on nudity in a non-sexual context Sex Simulated sexual activity may be portrayed but without genital images. Sex scenes will normally be based on responsible relationships. Casual sex scenes may only be briefly shown. There may be occasional strong verbal references to sexual behaviour.

The search was hampered by the fading light and there were fears that any survivors would not survive long in the very cold water. A park ranger was the first to spot the crash which he reported to the coastguard. A US Navy sea hawk hov ered over the scene looking for any signs of life as boats from all areas on the coast headed to the scene. Debris was scattered throughout the area. Officials at San Francisco airport where the plane was due to stop for a customs check were attempting to draw up a list of the 80 passengers and six crew on board the plane which is capable of carrying nearly twice that number. Searchlights were being used as news helicopters hovered in the area and were asked to maintain their distance. The swell was not too heavy and the coast guard said that there was still hope that some might have survived. Early reports suggested that the plane was upside down as it hit the water. The last major US disaster was in October. EgyptAir Flight 990 plummeted into the ocean 60 miles (100 kilometers) south of the Massachusetts island of Nantucket. All 217 people aboard the Boeing 767 were killed. The twin-engined MD-80 can carry 144 passengers, and is a successor to the popular DC-9 twinjet. The National Transportation Safety Board said it was assembling a \"go-team\" to investigate the crash. \"The NTSB is assembling an investigative go-team as part of its investigation into the crash of an Alaska Airlines flight this evening off the coast of California,\" the NTSB said in a statement. \"Information is very sketchy at this point.\" Fishing vessels with lights for night fishing joined the search for survivors as anxious relatives gathered at the aiports in Seattle and San Francisco. It is thought that the plane carried a number of holiday-makers returning from a winter break in the sun.",

These two conditions essentially tie together, and some people think they are to do with the \"docking\" process of the UK and euro economies. The common inference is that because British short-term interest rates are two points higher than euro rates, and because we currently have much lower unemployment, going down to euro rates would launch a raging inflation. But almost every recent forecast based on a link between inflation and the labour market has proved wrong.

A mixture of growth and reform in Euroland might close the gap in economic performance but is hardly likely to provide a dramatic shift in opinion. Recession in the UK, particularly if accompanied by withdrawal of investment by high-profile companies, might turn the tide. But it is hard to see any combination of factors likely to cause a fundamental swing in public opinion in the next five years. Any organisation worth its salt should start to include long-term British exclusion from the euro zone in its contingency planning. And that includes the government.",

Encouraged by editor John W Campbell, van Vogt brought his interest in psychology and language to traditional science-fiction themes such as alien contact, interstellar war, time travel and its paradoxes, immortality and the superhuman. </p> <p>Although critics often found his plots complex, others saw him stretching the possibilities of the field while retaining the sense of wonder vital to imaginative fiction. </p> <p>AE van Vogt was born in Canada, and educated at var ious schools in Manitoba, graduating to the University of Ottawa in 1928. His first story sales were to \"true story\" confession magazines in the early 1930s while he was working as a census clerk and representative of Maclean Trade Papers. It was here that he honed a unique style, based on his reading of John W Gallishaw's The Only Two Ways To Write a Short Story, which included what van Vogt called \"a hang-up\" - some piece of missing information which the reader's imagination had to supply. </p> <p>Later, he developed a system to cope with story problems: he forced himself to wake up every 1 hours to think about a solution, and found that his subconscious would often have the problem resolved by morning. </p> <p>It was after a period of writing plays for Canadian radio that van Vogt rediscovered his early love of science fiction pulps, and, in 1939, he began submitting stories and serials to Astounding Science Fiction. Of his 38 novels, his earliest are still regarded as classics. His first, Slan, dealt with a persecuted race of human-bred mutants and attempts to bring peace between \"normals\" and their physical and mental superiors; The Weapon Shops Of Isher mixed future politics, immortality and galactic-scale space opera; The World of Null-A, and its sequel The Pawns of Null-A, introduced Alfred Kotzybski's general semantics - a system through which the higher levels of the mind could be accessed via non-Aristotelian (or null-A) teaching - into a galaxy-spanning political intrigue; the four stories that made up The Voyage Of The Space Beagle revolved around \"nexialist\" scientist Elliot Grosvenor, and how he and the crew of an intergalactic spacecraft coped with a variety of alien attackers. One sequence in this tale is a remarkable foreshadow of the movie, Alien, produced 36 years later. </p> <p>When, in 1948, The World Of Null-A was published in book form, it was the first SF magazine serial to appear in hardcover from a major publisher (earlier titles had appeared from specialist houses). In France, it was translated by surrealist Boris Vian and created a market for science fiction. </p> <p>However, van Vogt's interest in disciplines that would focus latent talent led him to dianetics, the memory auditing system developed by fellow SF writer L Ron Hubbard, which became the cornerstone of scientology. Although not interested in the mystical/religious aspects of scientology, van Vogt maintained the Los Angeles Hubbard Dianetic Centre from 1950 until 1961, partly financing the gesture by gathering together and reworking earlier stories into novels. </p> <p>He also worked on his only non-SF novel, The Violent Man (1982), about communist China. At the invitation of editor Frederick Pohl, he then returned to science fiction, producing a string of well-received stories for the magazine If. </p> <p>However, while some novels, notably The Silkie and The Battle Of Forever, were well-paced and well-written, van Vogt's fiction over the next two decades rarely achieved the critical acclaim his earlier work had earned.

But the 450ft-high attraction on the banks of the Thames in London will not be fully open to the public until the beginning of March. The wheel's operators British Airways described this morning's event as a \"soft opening\". Some disappointed customers who pre-booked rides for February were contacted two weeks ago to be told their trips were being postponed until March. The delay-hit wheel's first setback came when a clutch problem emerged just after Christmas last year. After that, safety inspectors ruled that the 1,500-tonne structure was not ready to take passengers on New Year's Eve, when it was officially opened amid fireworks and lasers, by the prime minister Tony Blair. Subsequent investigations revealed that the clutch problem was a manufacturing fault and that clutches on all 32 of the wheel's capsules, from which passengers will be afforded some of the best views in the capital, needed to be replaced.

Practitioners also feared that ministers were trying to downgrade the subject, despite huge interest. GCSE photography has already been scrapped. The campaign has been co-ordinated by Ashley la Grange, head of photography at Rickmansworth school in Hertfordshire, who enlisted the support of the leading lights in the photographic world to press for a proper review of the subject. They include photographers such as Eve Arnold and Don McCullin and representatives of Britain's most prestigious photographic organisations, including the V&amp;A, the Royal College of Art and the Royal Photographic Society. Yesterday the qualifications and curriculum authority confirmed that it had now decided to allow examining boards to offer an optional written exam. Mr la Grange said: \"This will ensure that candidates will have a broad-based understanding of the subject.\" Andy Golding, head of photography at the University of Westminster, added: \"It is essential that students have more than just a practical grounding\".",

Will they never learn? </p> <p>Back in 1994-5 Cricklade College entered into a trading agreement with a company called Extras Ltd. The European Social Fund agreed to pay 45% of the cost of IT training provided to the college by Extras Ltd, so long as the college agreed in writing to pay the other 55%. But in 1996 DfEE officials investigated the training and the claims made for it from the European Social Fund. </p> <p>We now know that the Cricklade College principal, Richard Evans, and two of his top executives had been working a remarkable scheme. According to the PricewaterhouseCooper report, the college \"declared an intention to provide funding which it clearly had no intention of actually providing.\" </p> <p>It even got its hands on a substantial portion of the 45% which the European Social Fund paid to Extras Ltd, because Extras Ltd agreed to pay the college \u00a3109,053 for assessment and registration costs.

They all \"declined the opportunity\" to be interviewed by the investigators. Mr Evans gave them a formal statement and met them with a view to sharing documentation, and Mr Bradshaw gave a formal statement through his solicitors. </p> <p>In January 1998, when the governors started to see that they were in serious trouble, the chair and vice-chair saw Mr Evans, who promptly went off on sick leave. A few days later the governors suspended him on full pay; he is still suspended. Later, both Mr Bradshaw and Mr Clark were allowed to take early retirement with enhanced pensions (the exact terms of these pension deals is one of the college's many secrets). </p> <p>PricewaterhouseCooper recommended that the college \"consider using the disciplinary process now to clarify the position of the suspended principal\". </p> <p>They also suggested that the college consider reassessing the leaving packages of the other two. </p> <p>These recommendations were made secretly to the governors more than a year ago, and as far as anyone knows, nothing has been done about them. </p> <p>The contrast with the treatment of business studies lecturer Andy Murray could not be more stark. </p> <p>During 1998 college authorities accused Mr Murray of shopping them to the press.

It's what you do with the stuff you've bought in B &amp; Q. </strong> Ohhh! Pulleeeze! I really can't be expected to work under these conditions. </p> <p><strong> Look, don't get your swatches in a twist. I'm only kidding.</strong> Desist! The art of the interior designer must be no joking matter. </p> <p><strong> Pardon. Let me plump this cushion. Park yourself down and tell us all about it. </strong> Oh dear! It screams a bit, and those antimacassars... well, never mind. You should have come for professional advice. We're easy to find. Interior designers usually work freelance or in conjunction with architects. </p> <p><strong> What do they do? </strong> Squillions of things. The interior designer has to cover everything from the lighting and plumbing to the colour scheme. </p> <p><strong> What busy bunnies! </strong> Ooh, you don't know the half. Rushed off their toes from noon to night, poor things. They are responsible for sub-contracting (the choice of company, overseeing the workmen etc) and providing the detailed drawings which are used by every member of the team. They spend a great deal of time at the worksite and travelling to meet prospective clients. They organise the available space, furnishings and interior decorating to meet the client's requirements. </p> <p><strong> I expect some clients can be a bit difficult. </strong> You said it, duckie. Let's just say that the interior designer has to be able to use the client's criticism constructively, as it may need several designs before the desired effect is attained. </p> <p><strong> They've got to be able to draw? </strong> It does help, although these days designs are often drawn using computer software packages such as AutoCAD release 14. And some designers - mention no names - may choose to hire a draughtsperson. </p> <p><strong> So, what does the would-be designer need? </strong> Drawing ability definitely helps, and good communication and presentation skills are vital.

      "bodyText": "What is it? I'm frightfully sorry, but I'm not sure I can commune with someone who has to ask that question. Don't bother, I already know. It's what you do with the stuff you've bought in B &amp; Q. Ohhh! Pulleeeze! I really can't be expected to work under these conditions. Look, don't get your swatches in a twist. I'm only kidding. Desist! The art of the interior designer must be no joking matter. Pardon. Let me plump this cushion. Park yourself down and tell us all about it. Oh dear! It screams a bit, and those antimacassars... well, never mind. You should have come for professional advice. We're easy to find. Interior designers usually work freelance or in conjunction with architects. What do they do? Squillions of things. The interior designer has to cover everything from the lighting and plumbing to the colour scheme. What busy bunnies! Ooh, you don't know the half. Rushed off their toes from noon to night, poor things. They are responsible for sub-contracting (the choice of company, overseeing the workmen etc) and providing the detailed drawings which are used by every member of the team. They spend a great deal of time at the worksite and travelling to meet prospective clients. They organise the available space, furnishings and interior decorating to meet the client's requirements. I expect some clients can be a bit difficult. You said it, duckie. Let's just say that the interior designer has to be able to use the client's criticism constructively, as it may need several designs before the desired effect is attained. They've got to be able to draw? It does help, although these days designs are often drawn using computer software packages such as AutoCAD release 14. And some designers - mention no names - may choose to hire a draughtsperson. So, what does the would-be designer need? Drawing ability definitely helps, and good communication and presentation skills are vital. Also creative talent and imagination, which should go without saying, but you do see some horrors. I mean, where did you get those curtains? And good colour vision, of course. I suppose it's a changing buiness. Oh, yes. A designer must understand and keep up with latest trends, and that's on top of all the related professional practices such as costing, insurance requirements and all regulations regarding building and construction.

If the exam boards are failing to deliver accurate results, we are destroying the faith of young people, as well as jeopardising their careers. We should not have exams at all if we cannot have faith in the system,\" he said. </p> <p>Criticism is not confined to the independent sector. John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, said: \"There is a general feeling among state schools and colleges that the situation needs to be brought under control - quickly. Examining needs to be more efficient and consistent. And the appeals process needs to be improved. The length of time boards are taking on appeals is deplorable. In Scotland they turn the whole thing round in a fortnight.\" </p> <p>David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \"After complaints about the handling of the 1998 exams, I had a categoric assurance that the merger of the boards would lead to a better service. It's now clear from reports I'm getting about the 1999 exams that they still haven't got it right. The problem is basically incompetence, involving wrong marking and giving wrong grades to students who clearly should be receiving better.\" </p> <p>Sue Singer, headmistress of Guildford High School, said: \"It's a vicious circle. More people are questioning results and that is leading to a greater number of changes in grade. That in turn is encouraging more people to complain.\" </p> <p>Graham Able, master of Dulwich College, said part of the problem was organisational, stemming from the merger of boards with different traditions. But the underlying difficulty was a shortage of good examiners. Too much of the work was done by teachers at the end of a hard day at school, marking scripts at speed, without professional back-up. </p> <p>He called for large-scale experiments in \"residential marking\", releasing examiners from other duties to work full-time for a week marking scripts under the supervision of senior examiners. </p> <p>\"Examining will never be popular and the boards will never be able to pay enough to attract people in for the money. What will attract is if examining becomes part of a teacher's career development. If it was a requirement for becoming a head of department, you might bring more good young teachers into the marking pool.\" </p> <p>Those ideas find favour with Ron McLone, OCR director of policy, the exam board at the eye of the storm of protest. He said heads and principals used to want their teachers to have examining experience.

Inquiries from schools asking for results to be checked or remarked were less than 1% of entries. At OCR, the number fell from 16,528 in 1998 to 10,182 last year, although these numbers are hard to interpret. A complaint about the marks of a whole class counts as one inquiry, as does a challenge to a candidate's marks in a single module. </p> <p>He said the board's administrative difficulties in 1998 were the result of pressures from the last government pushing the speed of merger. \"Organisational change became hurried instead of bedding down at a more natural pace.\" There were problems integrating IT facilities. </p> <p>McLone said these were now sorted, but suggested the AQA consortium might have similar problems when it integrates its constituent operations this year.

It isn't just that more people are now being examined. It is also that the stakes are getting higher. This is especially true of A levels at a time of increasing participation in higher education.

Forty years ago, when I first took public examinations, there were more awarding bodies, fewer quality controls and limited mechanisms for ensuring comparability - and yet hardly anyone ever thought of contesting their grades. </p> <p>Awarding bodies today conduct their business much more openly and are constantly monitored by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. Problems therefore inevitably loom larger. Whether and to what extent they are greater is difficult to say, though recent mergers between awarding bodies have clearly added to the strain. </p> <p>Despite an unprecedented level of queries, only 0.5% of all GCSE or A-level grades awarded are subsequently changed. But this represents a large number of individuals and gives no room for complacency. Errors and difficulties in ensuring consistent assessment also have a bigger effect on some subjects than others. At A level in particular, the matter is very serious: university places and life chances are at stake. </p> <p>A lot of effort has already gone into picking up problems at an early stage, putting them right, and analysing how best to improve on previous practice. Markers are closely supervised; large numbers of scripts on grade borderlines are double-checked; consistency of standards between awarding bodies, syllabuses and years is carefully monitored; and QCA, as exams regulator, scrutinises every aspect of the process. </p> <p>But even more can be done, and new measures are being introduced. </p> <p>First, best practice in examining has been incorporated in a new mandatory common code that comes into force this month and will apply to all qualifications. </p> <p>Second, awarding bodies will now be required to issue customer service statements specifying performance measures against which they will be held to account. </p> <p>Third, to ensure public account ability, QCA later this year will start making publicly available its monitoring reports on individual awarding bodies and qualifications. </p> <p>Fourth, targets have been set to ensure that awarding bodies process queries about results with due speed. The first report showing the extent to which these targets have been met will be issued in March. As a final court of appeal, the government has set up a new independent Examinations Appeals Board. In addition, all A-level and some GCSE candidates, following a recent decision by David Blunkett, will have access to their marked scripts for the first time. </p> <p>Finally, awarding will only become more consistent if we keep numbers of qualifications to a sensible minimum.

The first is how best to make use of new technology. Not only has progress in this area been slow, but some recent difficulties can be attributed to teething problems in using information and communication technology. And yet ICT is potentially a solution to a range of issues, through ICT-based examinations, computer marking and greater use of electronic communication between markers, awarding bodies and centres. QCA is exploring several approaches, including ICT-based tests and the electronic return of marked A-level and GCSE scripts to centres. </p> <p>The second, and maybe biggest, issue facing the exam system is how best to recruit enough high-quality markers. The challenge is all the greater now that students will be doing even more exams following recent reforms. Long-term solutions may have to include greater use of computer marking, increased expenditure on building up a cadre of experienced markers, and tough-minded decisions about whether current levels of external assessment are indefinitely sustainable. In the short term, getting across the message that exam marking is a valuable part of teachers' professional development must be a top priority. It would be a good start to the new decade if current initiatives in professional development and appraisal stimulated renewed interest in this crucial part of a teacher's role.</p> <p>\u0095 Dr Nicholas Tate is chief executive of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority.</p>",

Long-term solutions may have to include greater use of computer marking, increased expenditure on building up a cadre of experienced markers, and tough-minded decisions about whether current levels of external assessment are indefinitely sustainable. In the short term, getting across the message that exam marking is a valuable part of teachers' professional development must be a top priority. It would be a good start to the new decade if current initiatives in professional development and appraisal stimulated renewed interest in this crucial part of a teacher's role. \u0095 Dr Nicholas Tate is chief executive of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority.",

Entry and visa procedures were being streamlined. New arrangements were in place in New Delhi and being extended to Islamabad and Beijing. Immigration officials would now normally give students permission to stay for the full duration of the course rather than six months when they arrived. Overseas students would not now have to seek permission from job centres to work part-time during terms or full-time in the vacations. Spouses and dependants would also be able to work here. </p> <p>Students would be able to stay until the end of October following their course and would also be permitted to work for up to two years in a job related to their degree to gain experience - working in video production following a media studies course, for instance.</p> <p>\"We are sharpening our response to the needs of international students. Changes have been introduced to improve our welcome and the affordability of UK study,\" she told the launch at King's College London.</p> <p>A \u00a35m marketing campaign to help recruit 50,000 extra higher education students and 25,000 more into further education colleges by 2005 will be based on the new brand. Baroness Blackstone stressed that welcoming more international students would not mean home students being excluded. </p> <p>In marketing-speak the \"brand footprint\" of UK Education is supposed to mean \"a dynamic tradition, the new world class, being the best I can be\". It is to be \"responsive, welcoming, alive with possibilities\". The Brand Report for the British Council says the brand footprint currently involves quality and confidence but is also set in its ways. </p> <p>Australian education is seen as accessible, relaxed and matey - the image purveyed by Crocodile Dundee and soaps. The US is seen as forward-thinking and the land of opportunity. For young people Hollywood strongly influences their view of the British - \"loveably eccentric but also pompous stuffed shirts who are complacent within their rigid class system\".</p> <p>Blair's vision of Britain as a modern-minded country with a more positive attitude to Europe provides an \"unmissable opportunity\" to redress these negative images in their minds, argues the report.</p> <p>The UK Education campaign is a response to aggressive marketing by Australia, particularly in Asia. A one-stop shop in Singapore, for instance, provides information on applications, visas, accommodation, counselling on study options and pre-departure orientation. It also reflects the success of Scottish universities and colleges combining to market themselves abroad.</p>",

New arrangements were in place in New Delhi and being extended to Islamabad and Beijing. Immigration officials would now normally give students permission to stay for the full duration of the course rather than six months when they arrived. Overseas students would not now have to seek permission from job centres to work part-time during terms or full-time in the vacations. Spouses and dependants would also be able to work here. Students would be able to stay until the end of October following their course and would also be permitted to work for up to two years in a job related to their degree to gain experience - working in video production following a media studies course, for instance. \"We are sharpening our response to the needs of international students. Changes have been introduced to improve our welcome and the affordability of UK study,\" she told the launch at King's College London. A \u00a35m marketing campaign to help recruit 50,000 extra higher education students and 25,000 more into further education colleges by 2005 will be based on the new brand. Baroness Blackstone stressed that welcoming more international students would not mean home students being excluded. In marketing-speak the \"brand footprint\" of UK Education is supposed to mean \"a dynamic tradition, the new world class, being the best I can be\". It is to be \"responsive, welcoming, alive with possibilities\". The Brand Report for the British Council says the brand footprint currently involves quality and confidence but is also set in its ways. Australian education is seen as accessible, relaxed and matey - the image purveyed by Crocodile Dundee and soaps. The US is seen as forward-thinking and the land of opportunity. For young people Hollywood strongly influences their view of the British - \"loveably eccentric but also pompous stuffed shirts who are complacent within their rigid class system\". Blair's vision of Britain as a modern-minded country with a more positive attitude to Europe provides an \"unmissable opportunity\" to redress these negative images in their minds, argues the report. The UK Education campaign is a response to aggressive marketing by Australia, particularly in Asia. A one-stop shop in Singapore, for instance, provides information on applications, visas, accommodation, counselling on study options and pre-departure orientation. It also reflects the success of Scottish universities and colleges combining to market themselves abroad.",

If universities cannot produce the future language teachers for secondary, let alone primary schools - and there are now golden hellos to get linguists into teaching - we will be in a spiral of language decline. What is urgently needed is joined-up thinking that sees language learning as a national all-through provision, from school, to university, to continuing education. At least now we have a National Languages Inquiry, backed by Nuffield, whose remit - they report in the spring - is to stimulate a more holistic understanding of how the country can acquire its language skills and its informed openness to other cultures. It is excellent that our prime minister leads from the front by speaking a foreign language. It would be even better if languages and the importance of language-learning were to move to the forefront of our national debates this year, in preparation for the 2001 Year of Languages. \u0095 Hilary Footitt is chair of the University Council of Modern Languages.",

The NIH claims it did enough to make research laboratories aware of their obligations. </p> <p>Stuart Newman, a professor of cell biology at the New York Medical College, said: \"Whenever there are these kind of experiments, there are human subject committees and biosafety committees which inform the experimenter what the protocols are, to make sure nothing slips through the cracks. </p> <p>\"But it looks like a lot has been getting through the cracks, which makes me think these problems are being deliberately withheld.\" </p> <p>\"Because of the heavy commercialisation of this research there really is an incentive to keep secret anything that reflects badly on the progress of the work,\" said Professor Newman, who is also on the board of directors of a watchdog medical body, the Council for Responsible Genetics. </p> <p>Gene therapy trials are normally carried out on patients with terminal illnesses who are in a desperate condition, he argued, so \"experimenters can convince themselves that it was because they [the subjects] were sick anyway, and chalk it up to that.

The university gene therapy programme was closed down 10 days ago after several professional lapses were discovered which might have contributed to the death. After Gelsinger died, the NIH sent reminders that any \"adverse events\" had to be reported immediately. The reminders prompted 691 responses, 652 of which were late. It was found that many researchers were reporting only to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which keeps information secret. The NIH, which publishes all the information it gets, was being kept in the dark. Several researchers claimed they had not reported deaths in their trials to the NIH because they did not know it was a requirement. The NIH claims it did enough to make research laboratories aware of their obligations. Stuart Newman, a professor of cell biology at the New York Medical College, said: \"Whenever there are these kind of experiments, there are human subject committees and biosafety committees which inform the experimenter what the protocols are, to make sure nothing slips through the cracks. \"But it looks like a lot has been getting through the cracks, which makes me think these problems are being deliberately withheld.\" \"Because of the heavy commercialisation of this research there really is an incentive to keep secret anything that reflects badly on the progress of the work,\" said Professor Newman, who is also on the board of directors of a watchdog medical body, the Council for Responsible Genetics. Gene therapy trials are normally carried out on patients with terminal illnesses who are in a desperate condition, he argued, so \"experimenters can convince themselves that it was because they [the subjects] were sick anyway, and chalk it up to that. It gives them wiggle room\".",

      "body": "<p>Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation has underlined his growing interest in the mobile phone market by holding \"exploratory talks\" with Europe's biggest handset manufacturer Nokia about how the two companies could work more closely together. </p> <p>The talks between senior executives of the two companies were held earlier this month at Nokia's Helsinki headquarters. Mr Murdoch is understood to believe that consumers will increasingly want to access the films, television shows and information his company provides from mobile devices including phones. </p> <p>A senior executive at News Corporation said yesterday: \"Rupert sees it as the next frontier.\" </p> <p>Earlier this month, News Corp bought a 25% stake in One.tel, the Australian mobile phone company.

      "bodyText": "Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation has underlined his growing interest in the mobile phone market by holding \"exploratory talks\" with Europe's biggest handset manufacturer Nokia about how the two companies could work more closely together. The talks between senior executives of the two companies were held earlier this month at Nokia's Helsinki headquarters. Mr Murdoch is understood to believe that consumers will increasingly want to access the films, television shows and information his company provides from mobile devices including phones. A senior executive at News Corporation said yesterday: \"Rupert sees it as the next frontier.\" Earlier this month, News Corp bought a 25% stake in One.tel, the Australian mobile phone company. The $200m (\u00a3124m) investment came as One.tel was named as one of the bidders lining up for the auction of so-called third generation mobile phone licences in Britain that will allow high speed internet access and TV quality video phones. BSkyB, in which News Corp holds a 40% stake, held talks about joining the consortium led by Richard Branson's Virgin Group at the end of last year but withdrew at the same time as Mr Murdoch's intention to back One.tel's bid became apparent. Mr Murdoch and Peter Chernin, his designated number two at News Corp, attended \"show and tell\" discussions with Nokia as America Online and Time Warner announced their ground-breaking merger three weeks ago.

A News Corp executive stressed that the talks with Nokia were preliminary and may not lead to any corporate transaction. \"It was [about] learning about the business, getting to know them,\" he said. \"There's no deal on the table.\" News Corp has been linked to other technology companies in the welter of speculation that has followed the AOL Time Warner deal causing Mr Murdoch to publicly deny that he is considering merging with Yahoo!, the internet service provider.

Forensic pathologists regularly find discrepancies in up to 50% of certificates. Researchers have always been aware of these inaccuracies, but the Shipman trial has shown it is not only research that is threatened by such lax procedures. Burials require only one doctor's say so.

      "body": "<p>Harold Shipman's surgery in a parade of shops in Hyde, Greater Manchester, was open for business six days a week. His waiting room was usually packed with patients seeking consultations on complaints from the mundane to the life-threatening.</p> <p>Those patients were shocked when their friendly, efficient and hard-working GP was arrested in September 1998. A surge of support engulfed him. Patients refused to believe he could be a murderer, paying tribute to his dedication and efficiency, his hard work and his friendliness. Well-wishers filled his surgery with cards urging him to \"be strong\" and \"keep smiling\". One patient remembered him as a lovely man \"with twinkly eyes\"; another with heart problems said simply: \"He saved my life.\"</p> <p>Although some colleagues described him as arrogant, irascible and a man with a short fuse, most people who knew him could not be convinced that someone as ordinary as Harold Shipman could be Britain's biggest serial killer.</p> <p>But patients, relatives, and colleagues did not know the whole truth about him. Few knew he was a convicted drug addict who had fiddled prescriptions to get his fixes when a young GP in Todmorden, West Yorkshire, in the mid-1970s - an experience that he would draw on 25 years later to procure the morphine he needed for his murder spree.</p> <p>Nor was anyone told that, as a newly qualified GP, Shipman had supplied amphetamines to the young ravers of Todmorden for all-night dance sessions at Wigan Casino, nor that he handed out supplies of slimming pills to local girls desperate to keep their weight down.</p> <p>And certainly, none of his patients questioned his adherence to the Hippocratic Oath, pledging to do everything in his power to prolong and save life.</p> <p>Harold Shipman - always known as Fred - was born on January 14 1946 in Nottingham, the son of a lorry driver, and grew up on a council estate. After passing the 11-plus, he moved on to the city's High Pavement grammar school and it was while he was taking his A-levels there that his mother, Vera, died of cancer aged 42.</p> <p>He moved from Nottingham to Leeds university to study medicine. His fellow students have only hazy memories of him. Peter Costen said: \"What I remember about Fred was that he was just so ordinary and that he got married very early on and they had a child within a year. We saw very little of him because he had a wife and family. The thing I remember as remarkable about Fred was that he was unremarkable.\"</p> <p>Christakis Varnavides, who also qualified with Shipman in 1970, said: \"Most of us were single at that stage, so we didn't really mix. Although I didn't know him very well he certainly did not stand out in any way. He was just an average person.\"</p> <p>The 20-year-old medical student married 17-year-old window dresser Primrose Oxtoby, the daughter of a council worker from Wetherby, North Yorkshire, on November 5 1966 at Barkston Ash register office, a few miles south of Wetherby. Primrose was pregnant when they married and the couple's first child, Sarah Rosemary, was born the following year.</p> <p><b> Conservatives</b><br> After graduating from Leeds on July 13 1970, Shipman began his career at Pontefract general infirmary and received a diploma in child health in 1972, the year after the birth of his first son, Frederick Christopher. He decided to look for a job in general practice and moved to the Abraham Ormerod medical centre in Todmorden, where he soon impressed his colleagues and patients with his dedication, hard work and energy.</p> <p>\"He was a smashing fella and a very good doctor,\" remembers Molly Dunkerly, a former receptionist.</p> <p>Michael Grieve, a doctor living in retirement in Todmorden, recalls Shipman teaching his colleagues how to fit inter-uterine devices, then coming into use.</p> <p>\"He was was very good technically and very good clinically,\" he said. \"He'd got all the right qualifications and worked well. He was brilliant and put a lot of work into the practice. Mothers thought the world of him. But he was good with everyone. There were chaps who thought he was absolutely fantastic.\"</p> <p>The Shipmans settled into small town life in a Pennine valley and joined the local Conservatives. Primrose also joined the local choral society and her husband rolled up his sleeves and, with Dr Grieve, helped dig out piles of silt during the restoration of the Rochdale canal.</p> <p>\"I was quite pleased to have white collar people like him turning up to be a navvy,\" said Brian Holden, secretary of the Rochdale Canal Society. But what should have been a long and happy stay in Todmorden lasted only just over a year. In November 1975, Shipman was charged with three offences of obtaining a controlled drug by deception, three of unlawful possession of a controlled drug and two of forging declarations of exemption from prescription charges. He was addicted to pethedine and had been injecting himself for six months with large amounts of the drug, an analgesic and anaesthetic.</p> <p>Shipman was taking between 600 and 700 milligrams of pethedine a day to stave off depression. When the case came to court in February 1976, he pleaded guilty to the eight offences and asked for 75 others to be taken into consideration.</p> <p>He said he had taken to using the drug while suffering from depression caused by opposition to his ideas for improving the practice. His habit came to light after it became obvious that some patients were being prescribed large amounts of the drug.</p> <p>Halifax magistrates heard how he would prescribe pethedine for a patient but keep some for his own use. Sometimes none of the drug prescribed for patients would reach them. He was later to use the same methods to secure the morphine he needed for his killing spree.</p> <p>He was fined \u00a3600 and ordered to pay \u00a357.78 to the NHS in compensation, although he escaped a General Medical Council disciplinary hearing and could still practise as a doctor. But he needed help and was treated for his addiction at a specialist hospital near York, where he saw a psychiatrist.</p> <p>He had resigned from the Todmorden practice the previous December. Out of a job and with a wife and two young children to support, he eventually found work in Co Durham, where he became a clinical medical officer at the now defunct South-west Durham health authority.</p> <p>But he was there for only three weeks before joining the Donnebrook House medical practice in Hyde in 1977, having come clean about his conviction. He and Primrose moved into the semi in nearby Mottram that remains the family home to this day. Their third child, David Julian, was born in 1979, and the family was completed by the arrival of Samuel James in 1982.</p> <p>The children attended local state schools and Shipman became a parent governor of one of them. Family holidays were often spent camping in France and Shipman served in the St John Ambulance Brigade from 1980 to 1988 as divisional surgeon, area surgeon and area commissioner in east Manchester.</p> <p>Shipman and his wife would occasionally go for lunch at the Dog and Partridge near their home and he celebrated his 50th birthday by throwing a party for about 100 guests at the Il Maestro Italian restaurant, just across the road from his surgery. But the couple were not known for their socialising.</p> <p>The family lived quietly. Shipman and his wife kept up their membership of the Rochdale Canal Society and played an active part in the parent-teacher association at Longdendale School.</p> <p>Shipman remained a member of the Donnebrook group practice until the end of 1991, winning the respect of his patients - although not always his colleagues.</p> <p>Ian Napier, senior partner at Donnebrook, said: \"On the one hand he was charming, urbane and pleasant with patients, but he had another side to him and, if crossed, he was capable of making people's lives a misery.</p> <p>\"Towards the end of his time here, he refused to speak to the practice manager and if he wanted to talk to her he would write her a letter; she was expected to do the same in response. Even though they worked in the same building and he had to walk past her every day, he would completely ignore her.</p> <p>\"Although he was an excellent clinician, he could be volatile and bombastic; but when he was nice, he was very nice. He was very well read, but he liked people to know it. I remember on one occasion he reduced a drug company representative, who had only been in the job for two weeks, to tears. He was a funny sort of devil.\"</p> <p>One former member of staff said: \"No one else was up to his standard. You could not tell him anything and he was never wrong.\"</p> <p>Every few months he would show signs of violent and irrational mood swings, which he would take out on staff.</p> <p>\"He was not violent in any physical sense, it was almost like a childlike temper tantrum,\" said Dr Napier. \"He would go completely over the top and it was as if he had no control over it. He didn't do it with any of the partners. He would only talk like that to his subordinates.\"</p> <p>Eager to work on his own, Shipman set up a one-man practice at Donnebrook on January 1 1992 and five months later moved out to his own premises at 21 Market Street, Hyde, and eventually built up a list of 3,100 patients. His wife, Primrose, worked in the surgery's reception. He installed expensive equipment and the computer system on which he would later forge the medical history of some of the patients he murdered.</p> <p>Three years after moving into Market Street in March 1995, he killed 81-year-old widow Marie West, the first of his victims, injecting her with a fatal dose of morphine as she sat in her own front room. Over the following three years, he repeated his actions, culminating in the death of Kathleen Grundy.</p> <p>Over the autumn of 1998, as Shipman was questioned, then charged, by police and the grisly business of exhuming a dozen bodies carried on, the people of Hyde began to realise that their town had harboured a serial killer. Memories stirred of Myra Hindley and Ian Brady, the Moors murderers who had preyed on children from a council house on the Hattersley estate less than three miles from Shipman's surgery and only a couple from his modest home.</p> <p>Charles Douglas, who met Shipman through the trans-Pennine branch of the Small Practices Association, went to see the Hyde GP after the police investigation began. \"We spent a couple of hours talking. He was quite emotional on a number of occasions. He wouldn't have killed for money for himself or his family. That is not what drives him on. And he's too smart to do anything as crass as that.\"</p> <p>When Shipman was arrested, Dr Douglas took over his practice while a locum was sought.</p> <p>\"One of the biggest problems I had working in Fred's practice was helping his patients through their obvious distress. They were absolutely devastated. He had a huge bedrock of support from his staff and patients.</p> <p>\"Fred said to me, 'Usually you have to wait till you die to find out what your patients think about you. This has given an opportunity for many of my patients to talk to me and it has been very, very humbling.' He worked harder than any other GP I know in the NHS. He was an extraordinarily good GP.\"</p> <p>Shipman had also met Michael Taylor of Rochdale through the Small Practices Association and together they had greeted the then health secretary, Frank Dobson, when he attended the organisation's annual meeting at the Palace hotel in Manchester in June 1998, the month Kathleen Grundy was murdered.</p> <p>\"Fred tended to be somewhat grumpy at times. He could offend people but he was also very prepared to help. I think it's fair to say that we respected him and those of us who have been to his practice recognised that it was one of high quality. He was very energetic, very meticulous.</p> <p>\"I would regard him as a friend, but friendship comes in a variety of forms. It was friendship based on acquaintanceship and mutual respect, the need for information and the need to learn together. He is the not the sort of man I would seek out for a couple of jars.\"</p> <p>Like Dr Douglas, Dr Taylor spoke at length to Shipman after the police inquiries began.</p> <p><b> Ritual</b><br> \"He told me the allegations were false and said it was very upsetting and disconcerting. He mentioned how he had been on his way back from the post office when a patient crossed the road to see him and support him. He had just burst into tears.\"</p> <p>Shipman's wife, Primrose, watched the four-month trial from her reserved seat in the public gallery at the back of the court. She could see little more than the back of her husband's head as he sat in the dock and took notes of the proceedings.</p> <p>She showed little emotion and retired to a private room during breaks in the hearing. She did not talk to journalists but did not go out of her way to avoid them in the court's lobby. She was accompanied most often by her youngest son, 17-year-old Samuel, but all the Shipman children have joined their mother at some stage to support their father.</p> <p>Various theories have been put forward to explain why Shipman turned to murder. Some suggest that he was avenging the death of his mother, who died when he was 17. Others offer the more charitable view that he injected old ladies with 60 milligrams of morphine as a way of easing the burdens on the national health service.</p> <p>As for the will, one theory is that he made an inept attempt at forgery because, sated with killing, he wanted the ritual of deaths to come to an end.</p> <p>But perhaps in the end he simply could not resist playing God, proving that he could take life as well as save it.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Harold Shipman's surgery in a parade of shops in Hyde, Greater Manchester, was open for business six days a week. His waiting room was usually packed with patients seeking consultations on complaints from the mundane to the life-threatening. Those patients were shocked when their friendly, efficient and hard-working GP was arrested in September 1998. A surge of support engulfed him. Patients refused to believe he could be a murderer, paying tribute to his dedication and efficiency, his hard work and his friendliness. Well-wishers filled his surgery with cards urging him to \"be strong\" and \"keep smiling\". One patient remembered him as a lovely man \"with twinkly eyes\"; another with heart problems said simply: \"He saved my life.\" Although some colleagues described him as arrogant, irascible and a man with a short fuse, most people who knew him could not be convinced that someone as ordinary as Harold Shipman could be Britain's biggest serial killer. But patients, relatives, and colleagues did not know the whole truth about him. Few knew he was a convicted drug addict who had fiddled prescriptions to get his fixes when a young GP in Todmorden, West Yorkshire, in the mid-1970s - an experience that he would draw on 25 years later to procure the morphine he needed for his murder spree. Nor was anyone told that, as a newly qualified GP, Shipman had supplied amphetamines to the young ravers of Todmorden for all-night dance sessions at Wigan Casino, nor that he handed out supplies of slimming pills to local girls desperate to keep their weight down. And certainly, none of his patients questioned his adherence to the Hippocratic Oath, pledging to do everything in his power to prolong and save life. Harold Shipman - always known as Fred - was born on January 14 1946 in Nottingham, the son of a lorry driver, and grew up on a council estate. After passing the 11-plus, he moved on to the city's High Pavement grammar school and it was while he was taking his A-levels there that his mother, Vera, died of cancer aged 42. He moved from Nottingham to Leeds university to study medicine. His fellow students have only hazy memories of him. Peter Costen said: \"What I remember about Fred was that he was just so ordinary and that he got married very early on and they had a child within a year. We saw very little of him because he had a wife and family. The thing I remember as remarkable about Fred was that he was unremarkable.\" Christakis Varnavides, who also qualified with Shipman in 1970, said: \"Most of us were single at that stage, so we didn't really mix. Although I didn't know him very well he certainly did not stand out in any way. He was just an average person.\" The 20-year-old medical student married 17-year-old window dresser Primrose Oxtoby, the daughter of a council worker from Wetherby, North Yorkshire, on November 5 1966 at Barkston Ash register office, a few miles south of Wetherby. Primrose was pregnant when they married and the couple's first child, Sarah Rosemary, was born the following year. Conservatives After graduating from Leeds on July 13 1970, Shipman began his career at Pontefract general infirmary and received a diploma in child health in 1972, the year after the birth of his first son, Frederick Christopher. He decided to look for a job in general practice and moved to the Abraham Ormerod medical centre in Todmorden, where he soon impressed his colleagues and patients with his dedication, hard work and energy. \"He was a smashing fella and a very good doctor,\" remembers Molly Dunkerly, a former receptionist. Michael Grieve, a doctor living in retirement in Todmorden, recalls Shipman teaching his colleagues how to fit inter-uterine devices, then coming into use. \"He was was very good technically and very good clinically,\" he said. \"He'd got all the right qualifications and worked well. He was brilliant and put a lot of work into the practice. Mothers thought the world of him. But he was good with everyone. There were chaps who thought he was absolutely fantastic.\" The Shipmans settled into small town life in a Pennine valley and joined the local Conservatives. Primrose also joined the local choral society and her husband rolled up his sleeves and, with Dr Grieve, helped dig out piles of silt during the restoration of the Rochdale canal. \"I was quite pleased to have white collar people like him turning up to be a navvy,\" said Brian Holden, secretary of the Rochdale Canal Society. But what should have been a long and happy stay in Todmorden lasted only just over a year. In November 1975, Shipman was charged with three offences of obtaining a controlled drug by deception, three of unlawful possession of a controlled drug and two of forging declarations of exemption from prescription charges. He was addicted to pethedine and had been injecting himself for six months with large amounts of the drug, an analgesic and anaesthetic. Shipman was taking between 600 and 700 milligrams of pethedine a day to stave off depression. When the case came to court in February 1976, he pleaded guilty to the eight offences and asked for 75 others to be taken into consideration. He said he had taken to using the drug while suffering from depression caused by opposition to his ideas for improving the practice. His habit came to light after it became obvious that some patients were being prescribed large amounts of the drug. Halifax magistrates heard how he would prescribe pethedine for a patient but keep some for his own use. Sometimes none of the drug prescribed for patients would reach them. He was later to use the same methods to secure the morphine he needed for his killing spree. He was fined \u00a3600 and ordered to pay \u00a357.78 to the NHS in compensation, although he escaped a General Medical Council disciplinary hearing and could still practise as a doctor. But he needed help and was treated for his addiction at a specialist hospital near York, where he saw a psychiatrist. He had resigned from the Todmorden practice the previous December. Out of a job and with a wife and two young children to support, he eventually found work in Co Durham, where he became a clinical medical officer at the now defunct South-west Durham health authority. But he was there for only three weeks before joining the Donnebrook House medical practice in Hyde in 1977, having come clean about his conviction. He and Primrose moved into the semi in nearby Mottram that remains the family home to this day. Their third child, David Julian, was born in 1979, and the family was completed by the arrival of Samuel James in 1982. The children attended local state schools and Shipman became a parent governor of one of them. Family holidays were often spent camping in France and Shipman served in the St John Ambulance Brigade from 1980 to 1988 as divisional surgeon, area surgeon and area commissioner in east Manchester. Shipman and his wife would occasionally go for lunch at the Dog and Partridge near their home and he celebrated his 50th birthday by throwing a party for about 100 guests at the Il Maestro Italian restaurant, just across the road from his surgery. But the couple were not known for their socialising. The family lived quietly.

Shipman remained a member of the Donnebrook group practice until the end of 1991, winning the respect of his patients - although not always his colleagues. Ian Napier, senior partner at Donnebrook, said: \"On the one hand he was charming, urbane and pleasant with patients, but he had another side to him and, if crossed, he was capable of making people's lives a misery. \"Towards the end of his time here, he refused to speak to the practice manager and if he wanted to talk to her he would write her a letter; she was expected to do the same in response.

A registered medical practitioner has no legal duty to confirm that death has occurred. Doctors must merely supply a cause of death, but only if they have attended the deceased during the last illness. They are not required to see the body of the deceased, although some 90% do so.

He unpacked his equipment from his medical bag, selected a needle and wiped Mrs Grundy's arm in preparation.</p> <p>But instead of drawing blood, Shipman pumped the former mayoress of Hyde with a lethal dose of morphine. Within three hours, she was dead.</p> <p>Despite her advanced years, Mrs Grundy was, according to her daughter Angela Woodruff, \"a very vibrant, energetic, lively, happy, talkative, smiley person. She was brilliant. She was more like a 60-year-old\".</p> <p>She had also admired and trusted her GP. \"If a doctor says you need something doing, you say 'fine'. If a doctor says you need an injection, you say 'fine',\" Mrs Woodruff said last night, adding that her mother had sought out Shipman because \"she respected and trusted him hugely\".</p> <p>Mrs Grundy's fully-clothed body was discovered at 11.55am on the sofa in the sitting room of her unlocked home by two colleagues who had become anxious when she had failed to turn up at her pensioners' luncheon club. They called Shipman, who gave Mrs Grundy's body a cursory once-over and pronounced her dead, later to certifying that her cause of death was old age.</p> <p>Two weeks earlier, Mrs Grundy had consulted Shipman at his surgery in a line of shops close to Hyde's market place. She chatted to the doctor about whether she needed to have her ears syringed before Shipman excused himself. He went into the waiting room to ask two patients, Claire Hutchinson and Paul Spencer, if they could witness Mrs Grundy's signature. He presented a sheet of folded paper; they obliged.</p> <p>After her unexpected death, Shipman advised her grieving friends to contact local solicitors Hamilton Ward, who he said handled Mrs Grundy's affairs. Shipman knew that the firm had a will because he had typed it himself on the battered old Brother manual typewriter that police found in his surgery. He had dated it June 9 and signed it, forging Mrs Grundy's signature; he also forged the signatures of the witnesses, Ms Hutchinson and Mr Spencer, who had unknowingly given him examples to copy.</p> <p>\"I give all my estate, money and house to my doctor,\" Shipman typed on a standard will form he could have bought at the newsagent's next to his surgery. \"My family are not in need and I want to reward him for all the care he has given to me and the people of Hyde.\" He left behind a fingerprint which was later found by forensic scientists.</p> <p><b> Cack-handed forgery</b><br> It was not a neat job: it was written entirely in upper case, with missing letters where the typewriter had failed to keep up with his greedy fingers. \"It was a cack-handed attempt at forgery,\" said Detective Superintendent Bernard Postles, who led the murder inquiry.</p> <p>The will purported to leave Shipman an estate worth \u00a3386,402, including Mrs Grundy's home and a house she owned in Stockport. Hamilton Ward received it on June 24, the day Mrs Grundy died. It was accompanied by a letter which Shipman wrote on the same typewriter he had used for the will. He dated it June 9 and signed it \"K Grundy\".</p> <p>It said: \"Dear Sir, I enclose a copy of my will. I think it is clear in intent. I wish Dr shipman [sic] to benefit by having my estate but if he dies or cannot accept it, then the estate goes to my daughter.</p> <p>\"I would like you to be the executor of the will. I intend to make an appointment to discuss this and my will in the near future.\"</p> <p>Staff at the Hamilton Ward office in Hyde were puzzled: they had never acted for Mrs Grundy. They filed the will and awaited developments. On June 30, they received a letter, without an address, dated June 28 and typed on the now familiar Brother typewriter.</p> <p>\"Dear Sir, I regret to inform you that Mrs K Grundy of 79 Joel Lane, Hyde, died last week. I understand that she lodged a will with you, as I as a friend typed it out for her. Her daughter is at the address and you can contact her there.\" It was signed S or F Smith.</p> <p>Shipman had ticked the \"cremation\" box on the will form. But Mrs Grundy was not cremated: she was buried at Hyde Chapel on July 1 after a funeral service attended by hundreds of friends. Shipman was not among them</p> <p>A couple of weeks later, staff at Hamilton Ward managed to contact Mrs Grundy's daughter Angela Woodruff, herself a solicitor living in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire. She was surprised to hear about the will because she had a will signed by her mother leaving the estate to her. When she saw it, she at once suspected it was a forgery.</p> <p>\"The whole thing was just unbelievable,\" Mrs Woodruff said, giving evidence at Shipman's trial. \"The thought of mum \"signing a document so badly typed leaving everything to her doctor just didn't make any sense. It was inconceivable.\"</p> <p>Mrs Woodruff began her own inquiries: contacting the will's supposed witnesses and comparing the signatures. Last night, she spoke of the \"credibility gap\" she had to traverse in order to accept her own conclusions. \"For us to believe that the doctor had possibly forged a will, had possibly killed my mother, was a huge gap to cross,\" she said in a BBC interview. When she told police of her concerns on July 24, she sparked what eventually became one of the world's biggest investigations into the activities of a serial killer.</p> <p>Shipman had never before attempted to profit from his killings; the first time he tried, it led to his downfall. No one knows why he changed tack and he has given no explanation.</p> <p>Mrs Grundy's body was exhumed on August 1 1998 and morphine was found in her muscle tissue. Shipman had not just taken Mrs Grundy's life; he tried to destroy her good name to cover his tracks. He altered her medical records to suggest that she was abusing codeine, which can break down into morphine after death.</p> <p>He made up an entry suggesting she had come to see him on December 10 1996 and that her pupils were small, a sign of a persistent drug user. He added in near illegible handwriting: \"Constipated. Drug abuse at her age? Codeine - wait and see?\"</p> <p>Kathleen Grundy's death was the last in a long line of murders carried out by Shipman. His method was consistent: a swift, injection of morphine. He sailed close to the wind on more than one occasion; five of his victims were killed in his surgery, and one, Marie West, was dispatched while - unknown to Shipman - her friend Marian Hadfield was in next room.</p> <p><b> Morphine injection</b><br> Mrs Hadfield had been in the toilet when Shipman arrived to discuss the problems Mrs West was having with her replacement hip joint and remained in the kitchen to respect her friend's privacy. She heard the murmur of conversation between doctor and patient, then after a few minutes there was silence.</p> <p>On discovering Mrs Hadfield's presence in the house, a startled Shipman told her that Mrs West had \"collapsed on me\". He neither called an ambulance nor later requested a postmortem, claiming Mrs West had died of a stroke. She was cremated.</p> <p>Another victim, 63-year-old Ivy Lomas, was one of Shipman's regulars with a catalogue of problems: depression, anxiety, chronic bronchitis. Shipman killed her in the treatment room of his surgery on May 29 1997, and then went on to see another three patients in his consulting room before telling his receptionist that Mrs Lomas had died. He had not called for help.</p> <p>There are another dozen similar tales to those of the unexpected deaths of Kathleen Grundy, Maria West and Ivy Lomas. In total 12 bodies were exhumed between September and December 1998 on the orders of the coroner.</p> <p>Father Denis Maher of St Paul's Roman Catholic church in Hyde witnessed the exhumations of three women: Marie Quinn, Winifred Mellor and Bianka Pomfret, all of whom were part of his congregation.</p> <p>\"When you bury a person there is a sense of completion,\" he said. \"But to go there afterwards and interfere with that process in a cemetery, a sacred place, is horrendous.

But Det Supt Bernard Postles decided that in all succeeding cases bodies would be exhumed, examined by pathologists in the mortuary at Tameside general hospital and reinterred within 24 hours to minimise distress to relatives.</p> <p>\"We didn't embark on these exhumations speculatively,\" Mr Postles said. \"We investigated the deaths first.

      "bodyText": "Kathleen Grundy, 81 , fit as a fiddle and a tireless worker on behalf of the elderly, opened the door of her \u00a3150,000 cottage between 8.30am and 9am on the morning of June 24 1998 to greet her long-standing, highly-respected GP, Dr Harold Shipman. He had arrived, by arrangement, to take a routine blood test. He unpacked his equipment from his medical bag, selected a needle and wiped Mrs Grundy's arm in preparation. But instead of drawing blood, Shipman pumped the former mayoress of Hyde with a lethal dose of morphine. Within three hours, she was dead. Despite her advanced years, Mrs Grundy was, according to her daughter Angela Woodruff, \"a very vibrant, energetic, lively, happy, talkative, smiley person. She was brilliant. She was more like a 60-year-old\". She had also admired and trusted her GP. \"If a doctor says you need something doing, you say 'fine'. If a doctor says you need an injection, you say 'fine',\" Mrs Woodruff said last night, adding that her mother had sought out Shipman because \"she respected and trusted him hugely\". Mrs Grundy's fully-clothed body was discovered at 11.55am on the sofa in the sitting room of her unlocked home by two colleagues who had become anxious when she had failed to turn up at her pensioners' luncheon club. They called Shipman, who gave Mrs Grundy's body a cursory once-over and pronounced her dead, later to certifying that her cause of death was old age. Two weeks earlier, Mrs Grundy had consulted Shipman at his surgery in a line of shops close to Hyde's market place. She chatted to the doctor about whether she needed to have her ears syringed before Shipman excused himself. He went into the waiting room to ask two patients, Claire Hutchinson and Paul Spencer, if they could witness Mrs Grundy's signature. He presented a sheet of folded paper; they obliged. After her unexpected death, Shipman advised her grieving friends to contact local solicitors Hamilton Ward, who he said handled Mrs Grundy's affairs. Shipman knew that the firm had a will because he had typed it himself on the battered old Brother manual typewriter that police found in his surgery. He had dated it June 9 and signed it, forging Mrs Grundy's signature; he also forged the signatures of the witnesses, Ms Hutchinson and Mr Spencer, who had unknowingly given him examples to copy. \"I give all my estate, money and house to my doctor,\" Shipman typed on a standard will form he could have bought at the newsagent's next to his surgery. \"My family are not in need and I want to reward him for all the care he has given to me and the people of Hyde.\" He left behind a fingerprint which was later found by forensic scientists. Cack-handed forgery It was not a neat job: it was written entirely in upper case, with missing letters where the typewriter had failed to keep up with his greedy fingers. \"It was a cack-handed attempt at forgery,\" said Detective Superintendent Bernard Postles, who led the murder inquiry. The will purported to leave Shipman an estate worth \u00a3386,402, including Mrs Grundy's home and a house she owned in Stockport. Hamilton Ward received it on June 24, the day Mrs Grundy died. It was accompanied by a letter which Shipman wrote on the same typewriter he had used for the will. He dated it June 9 and signed it \"K Grundy\". It said: \"Dear Sir, I enclose a copy of my will. I think it is clear in intent. I wish Dr shipman [sic] to benefit by having my estate but if he dies or cannot accept it, then the estate goes to my daughter. \"I would like you to be the executor of the will. I intend to make an appointment to discuss this and my will in the near future.\" Staff at the Hamilton Ward office in Hyde were puzzled: they had never acted for Mrs Grundy.

It was Primrose Shipman, the grey-haired wife of the doctor who may have killed as many as 150 women with his lethal syringe.</p> <p>Mrs Shipman had been present throughout the 57-day trial and a trite phone melody seemed a cruelly bathetic end to her ordeal. Her son Christopher placed an arm around her shoulder.</p> <p>In the dock, her husband, in his familiar light brown suit and striped tie, could not see the woman he married 33 years ago. He showed no emotion as he was told that he would stay in prison for the rest of his days.</p> <p>But the judge showed emotion. He removed his wig and his voice trembled as he spoke directly to the victims' families.</p> <p>He told them how much he had admired their \"courage and quiet dignity\" as they gave evidence about what he had described as \"wicked, wicked crimes\". You could tell he meant every word.</p> <p>But the timing of the verdicts was probably as much of a surprise to Mr Justice Forbes as to everyone else. Barristers, solicitors, officials, reporters and members of the public who had queued for seats from 8am filed back into court at 4.15pm expecting to hear the judge give his usual kindly homily to the jury: go home, have a good rest, don't talk to anyone, come back in the morning.</p> <p>But there was a long delay. Slowly the lethargy at the end of a sixth day of waiting gave way to a realisation that verdicts were imminent. The judge's clerk stepped briskly in, spoke to defence and prosecution counsel and left.</p> <p>The seven men and five women of the jury filed in at 4.37 and the foreman stood up. Yes, they had reached verdicts on all counts.</p> <p>There was a collective sigh from the public gallery as the first guilty verdict was returned. The foreman paused before saying \"Guilty\" for the 15th time, as if suddenly realising the huge responsibility he and his colleagues had carried.</p> <p>As this litany of guilt unfolded, Shipman stared at the carved coat of arms above the judge's head; once he stuck his tongue in his cheek; at the end, he winced.</p> <p>He sat down as the prosecution told the court about his previous convictions involving pethidine abuse in 1976.</p> <p>Then the judge passed sentence. There was a stifled sob from the gallery as the judge mentioned the victim Joan Melia; the sound of crying as he reached Kathleen Wagstaff, the 13th name on the list.</p> <p>When Mr Justice Forbes said he would recommend that life should mean life, someone cried \"Yes!\" and there was a smattering of applause.</p> <p>At 5.07pm, it was all over. Shipman appeared to urge his prison guards to hurry down the steps to the cells.</p>",

It played a silly tune and someone reached into her bag to stop it. It was Primrose Shipman, the grey-haired wife of the doctor who may have killed as many as 150 women with his lethal syringe. Mrs Shipman had been present throughout the 57-day trial and a trite phone melody seemed a cruelly bathetic end to her ordeal. Her son Christopher placed an arm around her shoulder. In the dock, her husband, in his familiar light brown suit and striped tie, could not see the woman he married 33 years ago. He showed no emotion as he was told that he would stay in prison for the rest of his days. But the judge showed emotion. He removed his wig and his voice trembled as he spoke directly to the victims' families. He told them how much he had admired their \"courage and quiet dignity\" as they gave evidence about what he had described as \"wicked, wicked crimes\". You could tell he meant every word. But the timing of the verdicts was probably as much of a surprise to Mr Justice Forbes as to everyone else. Barristers, solicitors, officials, reporters and members of the public who had queued for seats from 8am filed back into court at 4.15pm expecting to hear the judge give his usual kindly homily to the jury: go home, have a good rest, don't talk to anyone, come back in the morning. But there was a long delay. Slowly the lethargy at the end of a sixth day of waiting gave way to a realisation that verdicts were imminent. The judge's clerk stepped briskly in, spoke to defence and prosecution counsel and left. The seven men and five women of the jury filed in at 4.37 and the foreman stood up. Yes, they had reached verdicts on all counts. There was a collective sigh from the public gallery as the first guilty verdict was returned. The foreman paused before saying \"Guilty\" for the 15th time, as if suddenly realising the huge responsibility he and his colleagues had carried. As this litany of guilt unfolded, Shipman stared at the carved coat of arms above the judge's head; once he stuck his tongue in his cheek; at the end, he winced. He sat down as the prosecution told the court about his previous convictions involving pethidine abuse in 1976. Then the judge passed sentence. There was a stifled sob from the gallery as the judge mentioned the victim Joan Melia; the sound of crying as he reached Kathleen Wagstaff, the 13th name on the list. When Mr Justice Forbes said he would recommend that life should mean life, someone cried \"Yes!\" and there was a smattering of applause. At 5.07pm, it was all over. Shipman appeared to urge his prison guards to hurry down the steps to the cells.",

      "body": "<p>Saturday night at CC Blooms and the dance floor is heaving to the sounds of high-energy disco music. Standing at the apex of Edinburgh's pink triangle, around 30 underdressed partygoers queue for up to 15 minutes to get into one of the city's most popular gay nightclubs.</p> <p>But when dawn broke on Sunday the Catholic faithful assembled across the road at St Mary's cathedral, to hear the reveller's lifestyle condemned from the pulpit in a statement read out by Scotland's eight Catholic bishops.</p> <p>The battle over the decision to repeal section 28, which forbids local councils \"to promote homosexuality\" in schools, has been more intense in Scotland than anywhere else in Great Britain.</p> <p>For the past fortnight the issue has scarcely been off the front pages of the Scottish press, which has devoted entire letters pages to the issue, quoting every thing from Nelson Mandela to Leviticus. On Sunday, millionaire businessman Brian Souter, who has donated \u00a3500,000 to a campaign to keep the section, threatened \"poll tax style\" demonstrations against the Scottish parliament if it pushes ahead with its plans for repeal.</p> <p>The basic faultlines of the debate are identical to those in England - a mixture of ignorance and bigotry masquerading as populist conservatism, pitched against a small minority backed by the political class. But the row in Scotland goes beyond section 28. Despite all the column inches, nobody seriously believes that the Labour-Liberal coalition which runs the Scottish parliament is likely to go back on its word. What we are seeing is Scotland's key players jockeying for position as they square up to establish their credentials as the nation's political culture finds new expression in a devolved parliament.</p> <p>Nowhere is this truer than with the Catholic church - last week its leader, Cardinal Thomas Winning, described homosexuality as a \"perversion\" - which is desperate to make its mark on the new political landscape. Catholics are a minority in Scotland but retain a powerful voice with the labour movement. Whatever their denomination, Scots take their religion far more seriously than the English. Even though, as in England, church attendance is declining, Scots remain almost twice as likely to attend church as the English, according to Christian research. And the church's influence is not confined to Sundays. On weekdays, religion segregates many schools, and on Saturdays it is likely to determine which football team you support - Celtic are known as the Pope's XI.</p> <p>Scotland's liberal establishment thought it was was well on the way to establishing a progressive consensus to the left of Tony Blair, akin to the Scandinavian model. But in the absence of credible Conservative opposition it is now finding itself in head-on collision with a church which is claiming an influence similar to the Polish clergy, as the principle vehicle for social reaction.</p> <p>The campaign to keep the clause had a huge impact on the debate in Westminster. Before the furore in Scotland the issue had only surfaced as an example of William Hague's \"rightwing extremism\" after his opposition to repeal sent Shaun Woodward into the hands of Labour.</p> <p>Now it has re-emerged as a mainstream issue which is causing tension within Blair's cabinet.

      "bodyText": "Saturday night at CC Blooms and the dance floor is heaving to the sounds of high-energy disco music. Standing at the apex of Edinburgh's pink triangle, around 30 underdressed partygoers queue for up to 15 minutes to get into one of the city's most popular gay nightclubs. But when dawn broke on Sunday the Catholic faithful assembled across the road at St Mary's cathedral, to hear the reveller's lifestyle condemned from the pulpit in a statement read out by Scotland's eight Catholic bishops. The battle over the decision to repeal section 28, which forbids local councils \"to promote homosexuality\" in schools, has been more intense in Scotland than anywhere else in Great Britain. For the past fortnight the issue has scarcely been off the front pages of the Scottish press, which has devoted entire letters pages to the issue, quoting every thing from Nelson Mandela to Leviticus. On Sunday, millionaire businessman Brian Souter, who has donated \u00a3500,000 to a campaign to keep the section, threatened \"poll tax style\" demonstrations against the Scottish parliament if it pushes ahead with its plans for repeal. The basic faultlines of the debate are identical to those in England - a mixture of ignorance and bigotry masquerading as populist conservatism, pitched against a small minority backed by the political class. But the row in Scotland goes beyond section 28. Despite all the column inches, nobody seriously believes that the Labour-Liberal coalition which runs the Scottish parliament is likely to go back on its word. What we are seeing is Scotland's key players jockeying for position as they square up to establish their credentials as the nation's political culture finds new expression in a devolved parliament. Nowhere is this truer than with the Catholic church - last week its leader, Cardinal Thomas Winning, described homosexuality as a \"perversion\" - which is desperate to make its mark on the new political landscape. Catholics are a minority in Scotland but retain a powerful voice with the labour movement. Whatever their denomination, Scots take their religion far more seriously than the English. Even though, as in England, church attendance is declining, Scots remain almost twice as likely to attend church as the English, according to Christian research. And the church's influence is not confined to Sundays. On weekdays, religion segregates many schools, and on Saturdays it is likely to determine which football team you support - Celtic are known as the Pope's XI. Scotland's liberal establishment thought it was was well on the way to establishing a progressive consensus to the left of Tony Blair, akin to the Scandinavian model. But in the absence of credible Conservative opposition it is now finding itself in head-on collision with a church which is claiming an influence similar to the Polish clergy, as the principle vehicle for social reaction. The campaign to keep the clause had a huge impact on the debate in Westminster. Before the furore in Scotland the issue had only surfaced as an example of William Hague's \"rightwing extremism\" after his opposition to repeal sent Shaun Woodward into the hands of Labour. Now it has re-emerged as a mainstream issue which is causing tension within Blair's cabinet. Last week, after the prime minister hinted that he might allow a free vote on the issue, the front page of the Scotsman proclaimed that the \"tail was now wagging the dog\". Blair eventually backtracked but the precedent had already been established - middle England was following middle Scotland's lead. It is the most potent example yet of how devolution is set to transform political dialogue both between the nations of the United Kingdom and within them. Politics may be the art of the possible. But with the emergence of new parliaments and assemblies, drawing on their own distinctive political traditions, come the green shoots of new possiblities that are no longer so easy to dismiss. If Labour can find a way to ensure that Scottish students only pay their tuition fees after graduation, then why can they not do it in the rest of the UK? If they can ban fox hunting there, why not here? And London and Wales are going their own way as well.

      "bodyText": "Education is a precious commodity and yet one still denied to many children and young people (The right to education, January 31). But for your campaign to be successful, it must focus more broadly on access to learning, taking into account the range of social and economic factors such as poverty, attitudes about gender, conflict and ill-health which impact on the lives of the child and young people. In many parts of Africa, the spread of Aids, for example, is having a profound impact on education, depleting an already limited teaching force, undermining parents' ability or willingness to pay for education, and generating social upheaval. But attendance at school is not in itself a guarantee of access to learning. Despite enthusiasm on the ground, schools, particularly in the poorest countries, are often ill equipped to provide young people with a challenging and fulfilling education. Lack of connection between schools and communities; limiting teaching styles; materials and approaches which fail to accommodate mother tongues; strategies which do not recognise that for many children schooling is not a continuous but a fragmented process, all combine to limit the impact of schools. Only if you begin to tackle these issues will you be able to increase enrolment and reduce student drop-out rates. Within the Bank we are beginning to make these connections and to introduce a more integrated approach to our programmes.",

While gay rights campaigners complained that it portrayed gay men as sex maniacs, the tabloids dubbed the show \"Eastbenders!\" which is odd considering it's set over 200 miles from the East End, in Manchester.</p> <p>The first series of the deviant drama was very popular in the gay community but, much to the apparent surprise of the show's producer, the largest audience share, at over 50%, was made up of women. While some may say the viewing figures point to nothing more staggering than the fact that there are more women than gay men in the country, others have suggested that women's enjoyment of Queer As Folk is symptomatic of something more complex in the female psyche. In a recent interview, Nicky Schindler, the show's producer, said: \"Women love to watch men who feel safe. It's the same reason boy bands are popular with young girls - it's the hint of sex without anyone having a penis.\"</p> <p>For anyone who has watched the programme, the assertion that the sex involved amounts to a \"hint\" will seem odd. Do three-in-a-bed romps, masturbation, shower scenes, sex in a toilet, sex on the internet and sex perpetually on the brains of the cast really constitute only a hint?</p> <p>If women's enjoyment of QAF is about sex, then isn't it simply for the God-I-can't-believe-they're-showing- this-on-TV-it's-so-graphic sex? After all, should it be so surprising that women have fantasies about fit, tanned men writhing around in bed together? So hard to believe that women can get the same kind of thrill watching this series as a man can get watching a lesbian skin flick?</p> <p>But Schindler has put forward another reason as to why QAF holds a special appeal to women: its central theme of unrequited love. \"I can totally see why women loved it. It's about unrequited love, something all of us have experienced countless times.\"</p> <p>This Bront\u00eb-esque theme is an appealing one but if it is a theme more attractive to women, it is probably simply because it makes a refreshing change to see a man playing the part of the angst-ridden heroine pining after the heart of the cold distant hero, rather than the usual woman doing the old \"He's a bastard but I love him\" routine.</p> <p>It is unsurprising that women's interest in Queer As Folk has prompted cod psychologising. There is an idea that women and gay men enjoy a particular type of bond, an idea that, if it is backed up at all rather than being left hanging in the air as one of those things you're just supposed to agree with, is done through the use of generalisations. These range from the insulting (\"They are as soppy and emotional/ interested in their appearance as each other\") to the standard (\"Gay men are more glamorous/fun/open/ easy to talk to and they don't go on about football and beer the way straight men do\"). All are ill thought-out notions that pigeonhole gay men, insult straight men and will seem daft to most women who have enjoyed friendships with either.</p> <p>Then there is the idea that women and gay men are close because they are both oppressed, a particularly victimy kind of theory used by the particularly victimy Bridget Jones and her gay friend Tom who believes that single women in their 30s and gay men are close because both are accustomed to disappointing their parents and being regarded by society as freaks. This notion, that women and gay men are joined together by the chains of their oppression, serves only to provide women with another chance to identify themselves as victims. Excellent - exactly what we needed.</p> <p>There are no universal laws about women's relationships with gay men precisely because there are no universal laws about why women choose any of the friends they do. A friend of mine lived with a gay guy at university because they were doing the same subjects and helped each other out. Another became friendly with a guy who was gay because they ended up in the same flatshare and started going down to the pub together. Lager, you could say, was what held them together.</p> <p>Legendary theatrical agent Peggy Ramsay was best friends with gay actor Simon Callow for 10 years, not because sex was subtracted from the equation. In fact Ramsay laboured long under the impression that Callow was heterosexual, going so far as to make the embarrassing faux pas of trying to seduce him before she found out he wasn't. Their mutual love of the arts, theatre and bitchy gossip provided enough reason to remain close.</p> <p>Mary Austin, Freddie Mercury's girlfriend for six years, until he decided he preferred men, remained the star's closest friend and confidante until his death, upon which he left her a 50% share of his wealth. She had initially been attracted to the star by his confidence - a trait she felt lacking in herself.</p> <p>Aside from the much derided fag hags - the small minority of women who seek out an especially camp, drama queenish type of gay man in order to have someone to dance with on a club podium - most women choose their friends for their qualities as human beings, not for their sexual persuasion. Women enjoyed Queer As Folk because women like well-acted, well-written drama, with the added bonus of a bit of attractive male flesh. I know that's what I'll be tuning in for.</p>",

Then there is the idea that women and gay men are close because they are both oppressed, a particularly victimy kind of theory used by the particularly victimy Bridget Jones and her gay friend Tom who believes that single women in their 30s and gay men are close because both are accustomed to disappointing their parents and being regarded by society as freaks. This notion, that women and gay men are joined together by the chains of their oppression, serves only to provide women with another chance to identify themselves as victims. Excellent - exactly what we needed. There are no universal laws about women's relationships with gay men precisely because there are no universal laws about why women choose any of the friends they do. A friend of mine lived with a gay guy at university because they were doing the same subjects and helped each other out. Another became friendly with a guy who was gay because they ended up in the same flatshare and started going down to the pub together. Lager, you could say, was what held them together. Legendary theatrical agent Peggy Ramsay was best friends with gay actor Simon Callow for 10 years, not because sex was subtracted from the equation. In fact Ramsay laboured long under the impression that Callow was heterosexual, going so far as to make the embarrassing faux pas of trying to seduce him before she found out he wasn't. Their mutual love of the arts, theatre and bitchy gossip provided enough reason to remain close. Mary Austin, Freddie Mercury's girlfriend for six years, until he decided he preferred men, remained the star's closest friend and confidante until his death, upon which he left her a 50% share of his wealth. She had initially been attracted to the star by his confidence - a trait she felt lacking in herself. Aside from the much derided fag hags - the small minority of women who seek out an especially camp, drama queenish type of gay man in order to have someone to dance with on a club podium - most women choose their friends for their qualities as human beings, not for their sexual persuasion. Women enjoyed Queer As Folk because women like well-acted, well-written drama, with the added bonus of a bit of attractive male flesh. I know that's what I'll be tuning in for.",

The trend is led by 20-something women, with 53% in London admitting they regularly go out for a drink after work. Dubbed the After Hours Home Avoiders, AH-HAs, these women are committed to working and playing hard, enjoying a packed social life and relishing their freedom. The magazine cites the change in the average age of women having children as one of the main reasons for the phenomenon. It states that women in their 20s have more time to socialise because they are not looking to have children until their 30s. Jim Murphy, director of Model Reasoning, a company that forecasts social trends, said the phenomenon was also due to the need for escape after a long day. \"People in the UK work the longest hours in Europe,\" he said. \"Not only does this mean that they have to cram their socialising into a shorter period of time, they also want a quick escape from work and their pressured lifestyles.\" However, Justine Long, team leader at the Women's Alcohol Centre in London, warned that the lifestyle could have very damaging effects. \"A lot of women we see started drinking after work to alleviate the stresses of the day,\" she said. \"The problem is that it doesn't help.

This change is to make sure we have the same level of protection.\" Travel companies expect the changes to encourage tourism both in Britons going abroad and in foreign visitors.",

      "bodyText": "Paratrooper Lee Clegg was finally cleared yesterday of criminal wrongdoing over the shooting of two teenage joyriders in west Belfast in 1990, ending a lengthy legal battle. Clegg said last night that he was \"overwhelmed\" after the Northern Ireland court of appeal overturned a conviction for wounding Martin Peake, who died in the shooting. The judgment removed the last outstanding charge against Clegg, 31, who was acquitted at a retrial last year of murdering Karen Reilly, who was a passenger in the joyrider's car. Clegg was originally convicted in 1993 at Belfast crown court of murdering Miss Reilly, 18, and wounding Mr Peake, 17. The two victims were shot by an army patrol on Glen Road in west Belfast in September 1990 when their stolen Vauxhall Astra raced through a security checkpoint. The paratrooper, who fired four shots at the car, said he opened fire because he feared for the safety of his fellow soldiers. The judge at his original trial convicted Clegg of murder because he fired his final shot through the back of the car when the joyriders no longer presented a threat to the paratroopers. The Clegg case became one of the most politically sensitive in Northern Ireland when the Daily Mail launched a campaign in 1994 to clear his name. Under pressure from Tory backbenchers, the then Northern Ireland secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, used his powers to free Clegg on licence in 1995, sparking widespread rioting in nationalist areas. The court of appeal granted Clegg a retrial after new ballistics evidence challenged the evidence used in his original trial. Clegg was acquitted of murdering Miss Reilly last year but was again found guilty of the offence against Mr Peake. In yesterday's 36-page judgment, read out by Northern Ireland's lord chief justice, Sir Robert Carswell, Clegg was cleared of wounding Peake because of unreliable evidence from an RUC constable. The judgment said: \"In these circumstances we consider that the evidence upon which the conviction has to stand is frail and gives rise to an element of doubt in our minds whether it is being sufficiently clearly proved that the appellant did discharge a shot after the car when it had passed his position.\" The judgment attacked the \"highly discreditable behaviour\" of the paratroopers who were \"undoubtedly guilty\" of the shootings. However, it added: \"Sympathy for the families of Karen Reilly and Martin Peake in their tragic loss cannot be allowed to deflect a court from reaching a decision based on the law and the facts proved in evidence.\" An ecstatic Clegg said last night that he did not want to be triumphalist. \"At the end of the day, the shooting was a tragedy that could have been avoided,\" he said. \"Two young people lost their lives needlessly and this fact will remain with me long after the case has been forgotten about.\" His mother, Wynne Johnson, welcomed the judgment as the end of a nine-year nightmare for the family. \"It's brilliant,\" she said. \"That's it - the ball's finally stopped rolling after more than nine years.\" The Sinn Fein president and Belfast West MP, Gerry Adams, condemned the judgment as a \"dreadful verdict\". \"This is a grievous insult to the people of west Belfast and to the victims' families,\" he said.

It is proof of life after political death. Sociable MPs who occasionally sip a half of bitter in the Stranger's Bar at the Commons also noticed that Moonie and Kilfoyle ( also 53) are superficially similar characters.</p> <p>Tall and built for the scrum, both are genial, beer and scotch men who also smoke, despite (in Dr Moonie's case) expert knowledge of the medical consequences.</p> <p>They tell jokes, occasionally malicious ones, and entertain heterodox opinions. The comparison stops there. Peter Kilfoyle is a shrewd and thoughtful man who came up the hard way. An emotional man, he is a natural chum of Mo Mowlam, as his cerebral successor is not.</p> <p>Dr Moonie is the middle class son of a Dundee accountant, a psychiatrist who specialised in community medicine and got to Westminster in 1987 as MP for Kirkaldy.</p> <p>A keen golfer and serious bridge player who also used to coach footballers, he does not suffer fools gladly, which probably held him back. If he didn't like the Greenwich Dome, he said so and marshalled arguments to back his points.</p> <p>Dr Moonie, a father of two sons, got marked down at No 10 as lazy, a claim denied by friends who say \"he just thinks faster than most of us\". Having shown sufficient independence of mind to have given up all hope of office, he will now have to give up some lucrative medical sidelines.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Old Labour MPs who are also older Labour MPs will have a spring in their step this morning after learning yesterday that Dr Lewis Moonie had been appointed to fill Peter Kilfoyle's place as junior defence minister. Dr Moonie, who is 53 this month, has been given the job after being passed over at every reshuffle since 1997. It is proof of life after political death. Sociable MPs who occasionally sip a half of bitter in the Stranger's Bar at the Commons also noticed that Moonie and Kilfoyle ( also 53) are superficially similar characters. Tall and built for the scrum, both are genial, beer and scotch men who also smoke, despite (in Dr Moonie's case) expert knowledge of the medical consequences. They tell jokes, occasionally malicious ones, and entertain heterodox opinions. The comparison stops there. Peter Kilfoyle is a shrewd and thoughtful man who came up the hard way. An emotional man, he is a natural chum of Mo Mowlam, as his cerebral successor is not. Dr Moonie is the middle class son of a Dundee accountant, a psychiatrist who specialised in community medicine and got to Westminster in 1987 as MP for Kirkaldy. A keen golfer and serious bridge player who also used to coach footballers, he does not suffer fools gladly, which probably held him back. If he didn't like the Greenwich Dome, he said so and marshalled arguments to back his points. Dr Moonie, a father of two sons, got marked down at No 10 as lazy, a claim denied by friends who say \"he just thinks faster than most of us\". Having shown sufficient independence of mind to have given up all hope of office, he will now have to give up some lucrative medical sidelines.",

Not since John Moore was being touted as Margaret Thatcher's heir apparent when he took over the department of health and social security in 1987 (and promptly ploughed it by asking for a budget cut) has a fall from grace been so dramatic.</p> <p>What is going on here? This time last year Mo Mowlam was the People's Political Princess, heroine of that ever-growing lobby, the Campaign for Real Politicians, the ones who let their hair down in public (or take their wig off in Mo's case), who swear a bit, ad lib and don't slavishly repeat the party soundbites on Any Questions.</p> <p>She was briefly the \"obvious\" candidate for mayor of London, the one popular enough to beat Ken Livingstone. She didn't want it - too much risk, she wasn't even a Londoner - the story died. But voters still smiled at her the way they rarely warm to politicians.</p> <p>Since then there has been a long slide to the point where the New Statesman could run a cover story, illustrated by a drawing of the former Northern Ireland secretary as the broken statue of Ozymandias the fallen king of kings in Shelley's poem. \"Mo's Fall from Grace\" said the headline.</p> <p>That was January 10. Last weekend it started all over again. \"Mowlam is Victim of Whispering Campaign\", trumpeted the Independent on Sunday. Her health, her grip, her commitment were all called into question. Coincidentally, meanwhile, the Sunday Mirror had stumbled on the fact that Dr Mowlam (PhD Iowa University) has finally lost a running battle with the security services over the withdrawal of her two bodyguards and special driver, assigned to her ex officio as Our Woman at Stormont.</p> <p>The issue of her security arrangements has rumbled on since the summer and each time the spooks have backed off - until Thursday, days before the latest decommissioning deadline in Belfast and hours before a swordsman attacked Nigel Jones MP in Cheltenham.</p> <p>Mo, nowadays cabinet office minister in charge of policy \"enforcement\", was quoted as saying she was \"a bit surprised\" by the decision. \"I was told that my security [rating] was not high enough,\" she said.</p> <p>To many outsiders it looked like malice, as if the nameless whisperers against her had thrown a switch and got Tony Blair to take away Mowlam's policemen. Was this one more calculated slight to add to the growing catalogue? First the undiginified removal from the job she had professed her determination to keep. Then the relegation of her conference speech to a slot that would deny her the limelight grabbing opportunity that she had so successfully exploited before. Now this.</p> <p>The minister herself is more philosophical. \"If it was based on a security assessment and strict criteria I don't mind,\" she told me yesterday. That, security sources insist, is just what happened. \"Protection is not a political plaything,\" said one official. \"The decision is meant to be objective and dispassionate, based on an assessment of the threat to the individual which takes into account all intelligence information that is available.\"</p> <p>Whatever the truth behind the security decision, Dr Mowlam admits the whispers hurt. \"I was shocked at the vitriol in the Independent on Sunday, but I am not cross or fed-up. Some people are trying to get me out, but I am determined to keep going.\" The whispers that hurt most are the ones about her health, the brain tumour which laid her low before the 1997 election and won her public admiration for the way she soldiered on.</p> <p>The whisperers suggested she is still unwell or has not recovered her pre-tumour powers. \"I'm more than fine,\" Mo insists. But recovery takes time and Dr Mo has hardly taken it easy these past three years. The fact that her merchant banker husband, John Norton, lost his job last year and has not found another cannot help. They are currently selling their London house and have been shaken to learn that tumours and unemployment in the mid-40s, even among cabinet members, do not make for ideal mortgage applications.</p> <p>So who is behind the whispers, and why are they gunning for Mo? Mowlam is convinced there is someone, somewhere in Downing St (not Millbank) trying to get her. Some ministerial colleagues agree. So do some backbenchers. \"It's the same problem that Ken [Livingstone] has. They hate people who are popular and have an independent base in the party,\" one leftwinger said last night.</p> <p>To which the Blair camp replies: \"Not true, we want to bind her in and use her immense popularity.\" A funny way to do it, sending her to the cabinet office where she has introduced sandwich lunches with up to a dozen fellow ministers to thrash out problems (she had one yesterday) but rarely hits the top of the six o'clock news on TV.</p> <p>But it was her choice, comes the answer back. It is not true that she was denied the department of health for publicly saying she wanted to stay in Belfast last July. Mowlam aides say she could have had it as late as the October reshuffle - she did discuss it with Blair, his staff confirm - but opted for the broad-brush alternative to get her back into the big picture.</p> <p>Two rival theories intervene at this point. Mo was disinclined to put in the back-breaking work that the NHS demands, murmer critics. \"Look how much less hard she works to master a brief than, say, John Prescott.\" According to the rival version, Mo the People's Heroine, demanded assurances that the extra money the service needs would be forthcoming - and did not get them. Neither version can easily be confirmed, but each suits the myth-makers.</p> <p>Mowlam herself does not believe that Blair has lost faith in her. \"I get on very well with No 10,\" she says. From the other side of the locked door which separates her department from Blair's senior sources say: \"It's not Tony speaking out against her, not Jonathan Powell [chief of staff], Alistair Campbell [press secretary], David Milliband [head of the policy unit], or Anji Hunter [special adviser], so it doesn't matter does it?\"</p> <p>On this particular Monday the cabinet office enforcer has been busy with what every holder of her office knows is a difficult and elusive brief. Having no department to run with its juggernaut agenda, its special interests and media attention, the cabinet office post has usually been about the less visible business of tweaking the machinery of government and improving civil service performance without damaging their morale.</p> <p>Nowadays there's more of course - progress-chasing, what Tony Blair calls \"joined-up government\", sorting out those inter-departmental problems which require rival ministers heads to be knocked together. It has defeated many incumbents, including (lately) David Clark and Jack Cunningham. What does Mo say? She says she's enjoying the job, particularly working on social exclusion - drugs and homelessness, the sort of issues voters would expect Mowlam to respond to with her famous passion and humanity.</p> <p>Even modernising the civil service? Surely asking us to believe that Mo is enjoying wrestling with the mandarins is stretching our credulity. Not so, she insists. \"I quite seriously believe that the civil service as we have known it in the past has an important role in the future. Margaret Thatcher castrated it. If the civil service and values it brings to good government are going to survive into the future we are going to have to work with the civil service and reform it.\"</p> <p>Is this sort of talk convincing? Some MPs and officials would dispute it. Mo, they say, is a broad-brush operator, wonderful at wooing voters and pleasing Labour audiences with her informal ways. But she is not a details person, they say, never was, despite the PhD in politics. Hence the irritation of officials and Unionist politicians in Belfast - and some in London. After four months some officials at the cabinet office have started complaining privately about their minister's indecisive habits.</p> <p>The real trouble with Mo may simply be the obvious one: her virtues are the flip-side of her vices. Long before the brain tumour she had a wayward side to her character, the despair of party briefers who wished her well and also wished she would deliver the government's message on Any Questions as agreed.</p> <p>\"She's not fantastically good at doing what you ask her to do,\" admits one party official with a smile. Half the people who criticise Mo apologise before they do it. \"There again, if you got her to learn the script she wouldn't be the real Mo.\"</p> <p><b> April 1998</b></p> <p>Mowlam's relationship with unionists was already fraught by the time of the Good Friday agreement - they saw her as a nationalist sympathiser, and were alienated by her touchy-feely style.

      "body": "<p>Last month, Victoria's Secrets exposed the inner workings of the celebrity zoo, with Posh trading her gilded cage for a gamekeeper's landrover, patrolling big game like Elton John and, er, David Beckham. But Geri Haliwell has now realised you can do a lot more with a TV show than talk to other famous people. In Geri's World Walkabout tonight (10.20pm, BBC1), she meets unfamous people, proving that fame is no barrier when it comes to taking time out from a whirlwind life to make a documentary. Will Emma and the two Mels find time to make solo documentaries too? We offer some advice.</p> <p> <strong> There's only one star</strong> </p> <p> Victoria thought she was playing it safe by filling her show with her showbiz pals. But there's a big drawback to this ploy, which Geri has been quick to spot. With Elton John, Ruby Wax and Richard E Grant also in the shot, your celebrity cachet is diminished, not enhanced, and it becomes less about you than it does about them. </p> <p> <strong> Tackle any subject</strong> </p> <p> Street children? The slums of Rio? Eco living? The evils of the papal birth control policy? Political assassination? Concentration camps? You are Spice and you have Girl Power on your side, so don't be afraid to step into any area of life that you want to. Panorama does not have a monopoly on issues. </p> <p> <strong> Make your life work for you</strong> </p> <p> Making a TV show is easy when you've already got an interesting life. Victoria used her time with her celeb chums to fill her show; Geri has taken time out from her busy international schedule to meet the real people of the countries she's been visiting. </p> <p> <strong> Keep interrupting</strong> </p> <p> Again, it's Geri who wins hands down here. With real people there's never a conflict of celebrity auras, and Geri's free to interject with Paxmanesque authority whenever she wants. For example, she interviews Kris Aquino, daughter of assassinated Filipino opposition leader Benigno Aquino and former President Cory Aquino, and gets the lowdown on the changes in her life - from political prisoner's daughter, to exile's daughter, to martyr's daughter, to president's daughter. Just as Kris starts to make a really boring point about living life in the public eye, Geri gets stuck in: \"Your life has been like a soap opera hasn't it?\" Aquino stumbles to keep up with the charge, but it's a body blow, and we skip to the next item. </p> <p> <strong> Flaunt your lifestyle</strong> </p> <p> Don't miss an opportunity to show off your great life. The scenes from inside Geri's Berkshire mansion, sitting on her succulent sofa, iBook on lap, allows her the opportunity to emote with the rest of the world from her world. And fans get to see where the proceeds from Mi Chico Latino went. </p> <p> <strong> Keep it upbeat</strong> </p> <p> Music, as Spice World proved, can be used to great effect. Geri's World Walkabout is peppered with some really jaunty numbers (though strangely nothing from her opus Schizophonic) which livens up her visit to the rubbish-tip scavengers of the Philippines enormously. </p> <p> <strong> Turn everything back to you</strong> </p> <p> Victoria tried hard here. But again, by listening to her interviewees, and only talking about herself when asked, she really missed an opportunity to let us hear Posh on Posh. No such problem with Geri, who has confidently mastered the Art of Me. When she meets an eco-commune in Wales, she asks them what they feel about the outside world. \"We never go near it!\" one of the friendly hippies replies. A worried Geri cuts to the chase: \"I was wondering if you know me? Do you know that I left the Spice Girls?\" </p> <p> <strong> Keep it pop</strong> </p> <p> It's crucial to relate to people in ways everyone can understand.

      "bodyText": "Last month, Victoria's Secrets exposed the inner workings of the celebrity zoo, with Posh trading her gilded cage for a gamekeeper's landrover, patrolling big game like Elton John and, er, David Beckham. But Geri Haliwell has now realised you can do a lot more with a TV show than talk to other famous people. In Geri's World Walkabout tonight (10.20pm, BBC1), she meets unfamous people, proving that fame is no barrier when it comes to taking time out from a whirlwind life to make a documentary. Will Emma and the two Mels find time to make solo documentaries too? We offer some advice. There's only one star Victoria thought she was playing it safe by filling her show with her showbiz pals. But there's a big drawback to this ploy, which Geri has been quick to spot. With Elton John, Ruby Wax and Richard E Grant also in the shot, your celebrity cachet is diminished, not enhanced, and it becomes less about you than it does about them. Tackle any subject Street children? The slums of Rio? Eco living? The evils of the papal birth control policy? Political assassination? Concentration camps? You are Spice and you have Girl Power on your side, so don't be afraid to step into any area of life that you want to. Panorama does not have a monopoly on issues. Make your life work for you Making a TV show is easy when you've already got an interesting life. Victoria used her time with her celeb chums to fill her show; Geri has taken time out from her busy international schedule to meet the real people of the countries she's been visiting. Keep interrupting Again, it's Geri who wins hands down here. With real people there's never a conflict of celebrity auras, and Geri's free to interject with Paxmanesque authority whenever she wants. For example, she interviews Kris Aquino, daughter of assassinated Filipino opposition leader Benigno Aquino and former President Cory Aquino, and gets the lowdown on the changes in her life - from political prisoner's daughter, to exile's daughter, to martyr's daughter, to president's daughter. Just as Kris starts to make a really boring point about living life in the public eye, Geri gets stuck in: \"Your life has been like a soap opera hasn't it?\" Aquino stumbles to keep up with the charge, but it's a body blow, and we skip to the next item. Flaunt your lifestyle Don't miss an opportunity to show off your great life. The scenes from inside Geri's Berkshire mansion, sitting on her succulent sofa, iBook on lap, allows her the opportunity to emote with the rest of the world from her world. And fans get to see where the proceeds from Mi Chico Latino went. Keep it upbeat Music, as Spice World proved, can be used to great effect. Geri's World Walkabout is peppered with some really jaunty numbers (though strangely nothing from her opus Schizophonic) which livens up her visit to the rubbish-tip scavengers of the Philippines enormously. Turn everything back to you Victoria tried hard here. But again, by listening to her interviewees, and only talking about herself when asked, she really missed an opportunity to let us hear Posh on Posh. No such problem with Geri, who has confidently mastered the Art of Me. When she meets an eco-commune in Wales, she asks them what they feel about the outside world. \"We never go near it!\" one of the friendly hippies replies. A worried Geri cuts to the chase: \"I was wondering if you know me? Do you know that I left the Spice Girls?\" Keep it pop It's crucial to relate to people in ways everyone can understand. Geri knows this, and that's why she cuts off the Browns, New York parents of a family of five Mormon piano prodigies, in mid-sentence, to tell them they are just like The Waltons. And she's right. The Waltons had lots of kids too. Bring everyone up to your level With the Brown kids themselves, Geri caps off the interview by playing them Heart And Soul on one of their grand pianos. \"Let's do a pli\u00e9, that's all I know\", she instructs Reginaldo, a young boy from the Brazilian shantytown of Complexo do Alemao who has risen from adversity to win a Bolshoi scholarship. Use the Spice Being in the Spice Girls can prepare you for anything. Again, Geri has an advantage here over the other Spices as she knows what it's like to be a Spice and an ex-Spice. She asks the Brown kids what they would do if one was asked to do something without the others. \"We'd be happy for them,\" they unreasonably reply. But Geri knows what it's really really like to be in a group: \"You wouldn't feel a slight bit of jealousy? I would!\" While investigating the resurgence of fascism in Germany, Geri visits Sachsenhausen concentration camp, where her Spice experiences again come in handy. \"I am now standing in a concentration camp\", she says, wiping the tears from her eyes. \"This is where they used to incinerate the bodies. I think we've all felt hatred in our lives, sometimes to ourselves and other people,\" and here's it's hard not to share the pain of being an ex-Spice, \"but sometimes you just can't understand it.

      "bodyText": "MPs launched last night a savage attack on the fiasco that delayed and ruined the summer holidays for thousands of people applying for passports. The former home office minister Charles Wardle accused senior management in the home office and passport agency of \"not being able to negotiate their way out of paper bag\" in handling the crisis that led to tens of thousands of people queueing for hours outside their offices across Britain. They were furious when they were told that Siemens who installed a hi-tech computer system that processed fewer passports than the present one will pay up only \u00a32.45m of the \u00a312.6m bill for the debacle. Sir David Omand, the \u00a3100,000 a year permanent secretary at the home office, admitted to MPs that \"the public will have to pay\" for the rest of disaster forcing the cost of a passport from \u00a321 to \u00a328 last month. The MPs on the Commons public accounts committee - Parliament's spending watchdog - had summoned Sir David, David Gatenby, the former director of the passport agency, Bernard Herdan, the new director, and Gary Pusey, the managing director of Siemens Business Services, to explain what had gone wrong. Sir David told MPs that the government's much promised efficiency savings from the new system will not start to work until next year and will not have a real impact until 2004. In the meantime the public will have to pay much higher fees - including recouping the cost of thousands of umbrellas and luncheon vouchers paid out to people queueing for hours in the rain. Officials also admitted yesterday that the foreign office has also quietly transfered the cost of repatriating football hooligans, visiting British criminals in foreign jails and organising rescue attempts for British citizens kidnapped abroad to the passport fee. As a result some \u00a39 of the existing \u00a328 now goes to paying for the consul services abroad - the only area not covered is the loan of cash to stranded Britons which is recovered from the people involved. The most vicious criticism came from Mr Wardle who accused senior management of a couldn't care less attitude which lead Sir David to say \"I resent that attitude\" Cross questioning from Mr Wardle revealed that Sir David had thought of sacking the chief executive but had taken no action as he was due to retire last September as the crisis had begun to recede. Siemens managing director, Mr Pusey disclosed that the company had \u00a31.4bn worth of public sector contracts - two of which, the passport agency and immigration directorate were in trouble. \" \"Siemens seem to be the company that keeps people out of Britain and prevents the rest from leaving,\" Alan Williams, Labour MP for Swansea West, told him.

      "body": "<p>In 1966, Brunel College of Advanced Technology, at Uxbridge, west London, was designated a university. Its mission was to produce useful and employable graduates, and undertake applied research in the sciences and technology. It was the scientist, businessman and public servant Lord Halsbury, who has died aged 91, who became its first chancellor.</p> <p>The next 31 years showed that an inspired choice had been made. A university chancellorship is largely an honorific office, giving little power but much opportunity to meddle. On matters of university policy, a chancellor does well to speak only when spoken to and then sparingly.</p> <p>Tony Halsbury was an ideal chancellor. His opinion, given only when sought, was always careful, measured and constructive. But his interest and commitment were boundless. He had an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, and his desire to learn ever more about the university's disciplines made him hugely popular among the academics. He listened carefully to the concerns of students without ever interfering in the decisions which might follow.</p> <p>His annual graduation address, always delivered extempore, was built round \"whatever is on my mind at the moment\". Thus we were treated to scholarly, entertaining - and sometimes critical - analyses of British industry, modern management techniques, the two cultures, current parliamentary legislation and, on one occasion, the rightness of the Falklands war.</p> <p>It was Halsbury who, between 1961 and 1963, was chairman of the committee on decimal currency. Thus did he help prepare the country for the 1971 decimalisation. He argued for the retention of the pound, and it is probably to him that we owe the distinctive design of the 50p piece.</p> <p>Halsbury was the only son of the second Earl of Halsbury. He was educated at Eton, an experience he thoroughly enjoyed and which provided him with several lifelong friendships, including one with Quintin Hogg (later Lord Hailsham). After Eton, at his father's wish, he spent three years with a firm of chartered accountants and then, at Chelsea polytechnic, took a first-class degree in chemistry and maths. Meanwhile, he earned money as a French and Spanish interpreter. Later, he added Russian, and once even made a speech in Bulgarian.</p> <p>In 1935, Halsbury joined the firm of Lever Brothers on Merseyside. His discovery that vitamin A was two substances, subsequently named vitamin A1 and vitamin A2, was to him his greatest achievement. Lever Brothers probably appreciated more the speed with which he doubled the profits of the subsidiary company of which he was given charge. He left in 1942 after a dispute about the extent of his involvement with the Home Guard, which he had joined when the army turned him down.</p> <p>He moved to the Brown Firth research laboratories, converted himself into a metallurgist, and worked on jet engine development until 1947, when he became director of research to the the Decca record company, playing a crucial role in developing vinyl long-playing records. He succeeded to the title in 1943.</p> <p>In 1949, Halsbury began 10 years as managing director at the National Research Development Corporation, set up originally to protect investors and patents originating in the public sector against unauthorised exploitation. But Halsbury decided that its potential lay in developing public-private sector partnerships- and today's close and fertile relationship between universities and industry owes much to his pioneering work. But he did not lose sight of private sector initiatives, and his championing of laser development by G&amp;E Bradley Ltd, a subsidiary of Lucas Industries, of which he was a director, led to an essential tool of everyday life.</p> <p>Halsbury made his maiden speech in the House of Lords in 1952, after which he became a frequent contributor to debates, sitting as a cross- bencher. He sat on, and presided over, many committees and public bodies. These included chairing the Science Museum advisory council from 1951 to 1965, the review body on doctors' and dentists' pay from 1971 to 1974 (from which he resigned) and the departmental committee of inquiry into the pay of nurses, midwives, speech therapists and professions supplementary to medicine from 1974 to 1975.</p> <p>Halsbury's influence on our nation was considerable, but he wore the many honours he received with characteristic modesty. He was totally open, honest and uninterested in status or position, his or anyone else's.

      "bodyText": "In 1966, Brunel College of Advanced Technology, at Uxbridge, west London, was designated a university. Its mission was to produce useful and employable graduates, and undertake applied research in the sciences and technology. It was the scientist, businessman and public servant Lord Halsbury, who has died aged 91, who became its first chancellor. The next 31 years showed that an inspired choice had been made. A university chancellorship is largely an honorific office, giving little power but much opportunity to meddle. On matters of university policy, a chancellor does well to speak only when spoken to and then sparingly. Tony Halsbury was an ideal chancellor. His opinion, given only when sought, was always careful, measured and constructive. But his interest and commitment were boundless. He had an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, and his desire to learn ever more about the university's disciplines made him hugely popular among the academics. He listened carefully to the concerns of students without ever interfering in the decisions which might follow. His annual graduation address, always delivered extempore, was built round \"whatever is on my mind at the moment\". Thus we were treated to scholarly, entertaining - and sometimes critical - analyses of British industry, modern management techniques, the two cultures, current parliamentary legislation and, on one occasion, the rightness of the Falklands war. It was Halsbury who, between 1961 and 1963, was chairman of the committee on decimal currency. Thus did he help prepare the country for the 1971 decimalisation. He argued for the retention of the pound, and it is probably to him that we owe the distinctive design of the 50p piece. Halsbury was the only son of the second Earl of Halsbury. He was educated at Eton, an experience he thoroughly enjoyed and which provided him with several lifelong friendships, including one with Quintin Hogg (later Lord Hailsham). After Eton, at his father's wish, he spent three years with a firm of chartered accountants and then, at Chelsea polytechnic, took a first-class degree in chemistry and maths. Meanwhile, he earned money as a French and Spanish interpreter. Later, he added Russian, and once even made a speech in Bulgarian. In 1935, Halsbury joined the firm of Lever Brothers on Merseyside. His discovery that vitamin A was two substances, subsequently named vitamin A1 and vitamin A2, was to him his greatest achievement. Lever Brothers probably appreciated more the speed with which he doubled the profits of the subsidiary company of which he was given charge. He left in 1942 after a dispute about the extent of his involvement with the Home Guard, which he had joined when the army turned him down. He moved to the Brown Firth research laboratories, converted himself into a metallurgist, and worked on jet engine development until 1947, when he became director of research to the the Decca record company, playing a crucial role in developing vinyl long-playing records. He succeeded to the title in 1943. In 1949, Halsbury began 10 years as managing director at the National Research Development Corporation, set up originally to protect investors and patents originating in the public sector against unauthorised exploitation. But Halsbury decided that its potential lay in developing public-private sector partnerships- and today's close and fertile relationship between universities and industry owes much to his pioneering work. But he did not lose sight of private sector initiatives, and his championing of laser development by G&amp;E Bradley Ltd, a subsidiary of Lucas Industries, of which he was a director, led to an essential tool of everyday life. Halsbury made his maiden speech in the House of Lords in 1952, after which he became a frequent contributor to debates, sitting as a cross- bencher. He sat on, and presided over, many committees and public bodies. These included chairing the Science Museum advisory council from 1951 to 1965, the review body on doctors' and dentists' pay from 1971 to 1974 (from which he resigned) and the departmental committee of inquiry into the pay of nurses, midwives, speech therapists and professions supplementary to medicine from 1974 to 1975. Halsbury's influence on our nation was considerable, but he wore the many honours he received with characteristic modesty. He was totally open, honest and uninterested in status or position, his or anyone else's. He was greatly respected and greatly loved. His first marriage ended in divorce, and his second wife predeceased him. He leaves a son from the first marriage, and two daughters from the second. David Neave Professor Tony Ledwith, president of the Royal Society of Chemistry, writes: Tony Halsbury was a great friend of the society, of which he was an honorary fellow. He was a tireless advocate for science throughout his 80s and well into his 90s. In the Lords, he spoke on a wide range of legislation relevant to science, and to chemistry in particular, and moved amendments on many subjects, including the food safety bill, and, in 1996, the chemical weapons bill, where he began his speech by recalling that he had listened to a 1924 Lords debate when peers spoke with direct experience of the effect of gas in the first world war. He also played a key role in the 1990s in hosting part of the highly successful series of the Royal Society's parliamentary link days, which are the largest scientific meetings held in the House. Last June, I presented him with the society's parliamentary award for his contribution to the cause of science. He spoke from the crossbenches for the last time on the very last day before the summer recess of 1999, speaking both on the food standards bill and later to thank the staff of the House for all their work.

      "bodyText": "Indonesia's human rights commission yesterday formally accused the country's former military commander General Wiranto of \"crimes against humanity\" during and after last year's independence referendum in East Timor. The president, Abdurrahman Wahid, four days into a 16-day overseas tour, said that he would sack General Wiranto, who is now coordinating minister for politics and security, as soon as he returned home. Five other generals were among 33 people named in a wide-ranging report by the state-appointed commission on the destruction wreaked in East Timor after parliament in Jakarta voted to grant independence to the territory last August. The report was submitted to the attorney general. But some of the investigators expressed doubts whether General Wiranto would ever stand trial. \"Facts show that the civilian and military apparatus, including the police, cooperated with the militias to create an atmosphere that supported crimes against humanity,\" said the commission chairman, Djoko Sugianto. \"These were in the form of mass killings, torture, kidnapping, violence against women - including rape and sexual slavery - forced evacuations and total destruction of property.\" Albert Hasibuan, who led the investigative committee, said General Wiranto had committed \"sins of omission\". He was \"fully aware of the human rights abuses that were taking place, but did not take effective measures to stop them\". The other five generals named are army and police commanders who had direct responsibility for East Timor. Others on the list include the former civilian governor Abilio Soares and commanders of the militias created by the Indonesian armed forces created to carry out much of the terror. The attorney general, Marzuki Darusman, said that he would immediately form an investigative team to pursue the commission's findings. But he did not say how long any investigation might take. No prosecutions are likely for months, or years, partly because Indonesia's new democratic government has yet to draft or enact legislation to establish the human rights court in which anyone might be tried. President Wahid said after the commission published its findings: \"We have to uphold human rights in Indonesia, whatever the course.\" Some conservative Indonesian generals rushed to General Wiranto's defence, denying he had committed human rights abuses in East Timor. But the military's chief spokesman, Major-General Graito Usodo of the air force, said the military \"will not block any investigation in any way\". He said: \"We will support anything that is recommended by the attorney general.\" A commission member, HS Dillion, agreed that the military was unlikely to stage a coup to save the generals implicated in the report. \"This is a new Indonesia,\" he said. \"There's no such thing as 'the' army any more. There are many elements in the army. They do not mind shooting their own generals if they have to.\" But he doubted whether General Wiranto would be tried. The East Timorese independence leader, Jose Ramos-Horta, demanded yesterday that General Wiranto be brought to justice. \"In this day and age you cannot kill hundreds of people, destroy a whole country and then just get fired,\" he said.",

Two high points of her recent life had been playing the title role in Hedda Gabler for a local theatre company and giving a eulogy for the six members of a tiny urban guerilla group called the Symbionese Liberation Army who had died in a police shootout in Los Angeles.</p> <p>She was approached by a vaguely familiar-looking woman who thrust a note into her hand which said, \"Meet me at the church.\" After she had done so, she was introduced to another familiar-looking woman. They happened to be the two most wanted women in America: one was Emily Harris, one of the leading remaining members of the SLA; the other was the woman the SLA had kidnapped 18 months earlier, newspaper heiress Patty Hearst.</p> <p>From that moment when she was first recruited to help the SLA to the moment last June when she was arrested, Kathleen Ann Soliah has been a wanted woman herself. Except she stopped being Kathleen Ann Soliah some time ago. At the time of her arrest she was Sarah Olson, a respectable mother of three teenage girls living with her doctor husband, Fred, in St Paul, Minnesota. Her journey from a revolutionary, supposedly ready to hold up banks, to the soccer mom who likes amateur dramatics and writes cookbooks is remarkable in what it says about America then and now. It has also shone the spotlight once again on her fellow SLA members and what has become of them and their beliefs.</p> <p>Her trial is due to start shortly. Patty Hearst, who says she bears Soliah no animosity, is likely to be forced to testify against her. The case will reopen a period of confrontational history in America that many on both sides of the political spectrum would prefer to forget.</p> <p>The core members of the SLA, whose slogan was \"Death to the fascist insect that preys on the life of the people\" are, of course, dead. A mixture of ex-cons and confused middle-class radicals led by the unbalanced Donald DeFreeze, they perished in a gun battle and conflagration in south central Los Angeles during which 9,000 rounds were fired by both sides. The whole saga was watched live on television by Hearst and her surviving fellow members.</p> <p>Hearst, who, as she tells it in her book, Every Secret Thing, published in 1982, was raped, threatened and cajoled into joining the group, took the name of Tania and participated in SLA actions including a bank robbery, before she was caught in 1975 and jailed for seven years. Her sentence was commuted by the then president Jimmy Carter and she was released after serving 23 months. Further attempts to have her conviction quashed entirely have recently been made by Carter.</p> <p>Married to her former bodyguard, Bernard Shaw, who is now the director of security for the Hearst Corporation, Hearst has two teenage daughters, the elder at college, is involved in charity work and has made three appearances in the cult films of John Waters.</p> <p>What happened to Kathy Soliah will now almost certainly make a film and already there is talk in Los Angeles about who will play her part. But what became of the bit players and the political ideas that formed them?</p> <p>The FBI would dearly love to know the answer to what happened to Kilgore, Kathy's boyfriend at the time. A young political activist from San Rafael in Marin County, Kilgore escaped the final round-up and has never been caught. He featured on America's Most Wanted, the Crimewatch-style programme, last year at the time of the 25th anniversary of the kidnapping. This appeal led to Olson's capture - she is charged under her new name - but has yet to yield anything on Kilgore.</p> <p>The word is that he has found himself a quiet family life not unlike that of Olson and is waiting to see what happens in her case before he considers giving himself up. If Olson gets 25 years to life, goes the argument, Kilgore is unlikely to come waltzing out of a farmhouse in Nebraska with his hands up. So far none of his friends have nibbled at the $20,000 reward on offer.</p> <p>The two most powerful members of the group after the deaths of Donald DeFreeze and the others were Emily and Bill Harris, who then operated under the \"reborn\" Swahili names of Teko and Yolanda, and were arrested while out jogging at the same time as Hearst was caught.</p> <p>Bill Harris was jailed for eight years for his part in the kidnapping and subsequent SLA crimes and was released in 1983. He now works as a private legal investigator in San Francisco, is married to a lawyer and is a \"soccer dad\" who takes his young son to practice. He now accepts that the SLA accomplished nothing.</p> <p>He and Emily Harris, who was also jailed for eight years, divorced not long after they were released. She had taken a computer course inside prison and has since, without hiding her history, found work in the expanding computer world of Los Angeles where she now lives under a different name. Tracked down by the Los Angeles Times, to whom she spoke on the condition that no new photos were taken and her new identity was not revealed, she said: \"I made choices, and looking back now some of those choices were extremely reckless and ill-conceived. But I paid the price. I've moved on.\"</p> <p>Two others who have also moved on are Josephine Soliah, Kathy's younger sister, who also helped the SLA when the Harrises and Hearst were trying to flee, and who is now a nurse. She is now married to another who helped them, Michael Bortin, who installs hardwood floors. Bortin describes the case as \"like a deranged relative knocking at your door every few years\".</p> <p>Jack Scott, the sports writer and former Ramparts journalist who helped Hearst get across country to a safe house on the east coast when she was on the run, was never charged. He still lives in Berkeley with his teenage son, is suffering from throat cancer and runs a sports medicine clinic.</p> <p>As to the political legacy of the group, the passage of time has barely changed their status. The SLA were seen then by many on the left, from the Black Panthers to the Free Speech Movement to the French Marxist writer Regis Debray who wrote a letter to the San Francisco Examiner attacking the kidnapping, as crazy and counterproductive. Their first \"political act\" was the murder of Marcus Foster, a black education official in Oakland who was actually pushing through policies approved by the Panthers to try to improve the educational opportunities for young black students. Because Foster wanted ID cards on campus, the SLA suggested he was clearly a fascist and a suitable target, thus alienating what might have been one of their areas of qualified support. As happened during the same period in Europe with the Baader-Meinhof in Germany, the group had no real base or support and their achievements were largely in their own imaginations.</p> <p>For the LA police, the issue is straightforward: Soliah/Olson is alleged to have tried to kill some of their own by placing nail bombs under police cars, and the passage of time has not softened their attitude. Far from soft-pedalling the case, they have compiled a heavy dossier of evidence and the trial is likely to last much longer than was initially expected. Permission to televise it has been refused, as the judge said that, for Hearst, it would be like being raped again in public.</p> <p>The trial, which was due to start on Monday, has been temporarily set back because one of Soliah's legal team has withdrawn for family reasons. But the battle for the hearts and minds of the jurors has already begun in a legal system where people are not inhibited from speculating on guilt or innocence by the bothersome strictures of contempt of court.</p> <p>A gun shop owner in Olson's home town is selling bumper stickers with the legends: \"Fight terrorism, jail Kathleen\" and \"If it ticks, you must convict Soliah\". Olson's own team have a large and idiosyncratic web-site with musings from her brother Lance, details of how to buy her fund-raising cookbook, Serving Time, at $21, and pictures of her supporters in their campaign T-shirts. Her detractors call her as evil as Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma bomber, and hope that she is jailed for life. Her supporters believe that she was the product of a particular time - Vietnam, Watergate, black power, the military coup in Chile - when some on the left believe that violent behaviour by the authorities merited violent responses.</p> <p>Strangely enough, Jim Kilgore, the FBI's current most wanted, probably summed up the feelings of many for the SLA when, as Patty Hearst recalls, he challenged Teko in his pre-private detective days and asked: \"What did the SLA ever accomplish?

      "bodyText": "Rover will face an uphill struggle to meet its target of breakeven by 2002 if the government acts to cut the prices car buyers in Britain have to pay, industry sources say. The competition commission yesterday delivered its report on car prices to the department of trade and industry. The report, which has taken 11 months to prepare, is thought to recommend moves to break the manufacturers' control of prices in the UK. The government, in its attempt to end \"rip-off\" culture in Britain, is keen to abolish the system which allows manufacturers to charge thousands of pounds more for their vehicles in Britain than elsewhere in Europe. BMW, Rover's German parent, said yesterday that the British car maker's sales fell 25% last year, while deliveries in the UK were down by 32%. It blamed the downturn in sales on the strength of sterling and on model changes, and added that fourth quarter sales figures indicated that the decline had been halted. The Rover workforce fell by 18.8% to 29,884 last year. Further jobs are expected to go this year as the restructur ing of the company continues. BMW said the downturn at Rover had been offset by record sales of BMW-branded cars and motorcycles and of Land Rover - which was the strongest growing brand in the group. Rover is still waiting for the European commission to approve \u00a3141m of government grants towards the \u00a31.7bn redevelopment of its main Longbridge plant and the development of a new vehicle to replace its medium-sized models. A decision is expected some time in May. Rover is still expected to report a heavy loss for 1999. Industry sources said that any enforced price reductions in the UK - which accounts for 40% of Rover's sales - will make it even tougher for the company to return to profit. A Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders spokesman said it was a popular misconception that car companies were making excess profits in the UK. \"Rover proves that that is not the case,\" he said. \"There is no money to pass back.\" He said that the decision by the P&amp;O Stena ferry group to import a selection of cars at lower prices, announced yesterday, was \"cherry picking\". \"They are not offering a full service and have just picked cars where there is a wide price difference,\" he said. \"There is no three-year warranty, no trade-in, and so on.\" The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders yesterday wrote to Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, urging him to remove the continuing uncertainty over pricing levels by publishing the competition commission's report as soon as possible. The trade body said customers were putting off the purchase of a new car in the unreasonable expectation of a big drop in prices. The government said last year that the problem of high car prices in Britain might be solved by abolishing recommended retail prices, separating service and sales operations, and by bringing to an end the block exemption which enables manufacturers to sell though exclusive franchised dealers. \u0095 Nissan Diesel Motor, Japan's troubled lorry manufacturer, said yesterday that it would cut costs by 20% over the next three years. The announcement came as its largest shareholders and bankers were discussing ways of injecting new cash into the business.",

      "bodyText": "Lafarge, the agressively expanding French building materials group, is poised to launch a \u00a33.75bn cash bid to take over Britain's leading cement maker, Blue Circle. The French group, which bought Redland for \u00a31.8bn less than two years ago, was forced by market rumour and weekend reports to disclose that it was seriously considering an offer for its British rival. But Blue Circle - labouring under a Malaysian price war which produced a profits warning last autumn - said Lafarge had already suggested a possible price \"which would have significantly undervalued the company and did not merit discussion\". The French conglomerate is understood to have come in at 430p a share, valuing Blue Circle, a company which can trace its origins back to 1824, at around \u00a33.5bn. It is the latest move in an industry that has seen two British groups, Rugby and Tarmac, fall into other hands as cement and concrete producers join forces. Lafarge, already in the middle of a $256m bid with a partner to acquire one of Egypt's largest cement makers, is expected to come up with a full-scale and increased offer within the next few days, possibly as early as today. But sources close to the French group cautioned that the cash offer, if and when it comes, would not be substantially higher - and some analsysts expect it to put 450p a share on the table. Blue Circle, however, was buoyed by other analysts' valuations of 500p, which would make it worth \u00a34.1bn - and vowed to fight to retain its independence and avoid the fate of other chunks of British industry which have fallen into foreign hands. Its own shares rose more than 20% to close at 414p, still some way off their two-year high of 485p last June but substantially above the low of 285p reached after the chief executive, Rick Haythornthwaite, issued his profits warning in late October. Shares in its likely French predator dipped by \u20ac5 to close at \u20ac90.40 as investors took fright at the likely price to be extracted - and as Standard &amp; Poor's ratings agency puts its stock on negative watch because of fears that it would be financially overstretched in buying Blue Circle. The battle hinges on whether Blue Circle shareholders are more swayed by the prospect of instant cash or Mr Haythornthwaite's pledge to nullify his profits warning via an improved earnings performance, notably in Asia. He and his advisers believe that the initial 430p approach represents a paltry premium of around 16% on the 370p price seen at year-end, and includes no real bonus for a group valued at 475p for its break-up worth alone. The word is that Lafarge is in a self-created quandary, prompted by the leaks of its on-off intentions late last week, and that Blue Circle's own strategy as a focused cement maker merits a far greater offer. Lafarge, it is argued, has no interest in Blue Circle's 48% share of the UK cement market and, instead wants to grab its considerable presence in Asia - even in troubled Malaysia, root of its present financial difficulties. That is seen as a backhanded endorsement of its own strategy. The British group, industry sources say, is determnined to convince investors that under Mr Haythornwaite it has hit on a sustained programme of cost-savings and productivity gains that will engender shareholder value. It claims, moreover, to be having success in consolidating the Malaysian market and that its overall strategy will bear fruit in the near future.",

Never Mind the Buzzcocks was the number one show on BBC2. I had a successful radio show. Now I'm going on tour and I've got my own show on TV. What else could I want?\" </p> <p>Mark Lamarr pulls on his cigarette. He chain-smokes throughout the interview, keeping the adrenalin up, the edge sharp. What else could he want? The smile fades as he says: \"To write funnier jokes.\" </p> <p>That old Woody Allen line. In Stardust Memories aliens arrive on earth and Allen asks them: \"What's the meaning of life?\" \"Write funnier jokes,\" one replies. Good point: for a comic there is nothing more important in life. And, for the moment at least, Mark Lamarr is a comic. </p> <p>\"I suspect that little need to be funny will go. It generally does - very few comics have that sort of longevity - but it doesn't seem to have gone yet. To niggle, that's the important thing for me. Seinfeld said the comic's mind is always active and always irritable, and I think that's true. You're always thinking 'What's the angle here?' \" </p> <p>Lamarr is always trying to work out the angle, both to questions and his own answers. Typically, he will puncture his own rhetoric half way through a reply. Just after happily listing his achievements, for instance, he looks grim: \"I've always thought I've got another two or three years on television because I'm relatively successful. But I'm not needed, I know that. Cilla has got a much brighter, more secure future than me. Television is something to do for a little while, then it's back to my job.\" </p> <p>He's irritable, endlessly doubting, even self-doubting, as he reckons a comic should be. But hardly the angry young man he's been described as. Before he arrives for the interview, I set aside the obvious questions: what does he look like after he's just washed his hair? Bobby Charlton? A guitarist from Genesis? I wonder which chair he will take. Will he sit opposite, confrontationally? Or alongside, chummily? In fact, he sits at right angles, so that he can monologue into the middle distance. But now and again he will throw a sidelong glance and, between the 50s throwback quiff and the sharp suit, that baby face looks vulnerable, imploring. It seems he wants to be liked. He clearly has his good side: a few days after we meet he has his trademark quiff chopped off for charity. </p> <p>Here comes one of those glances now. \"I lacerate myself all the time. Morally, as a human being, I'm full of guilt. I don't know where that comes from: I wasn't brought up Catholic or Jewish. Even when I do something good, it's never good enough.\" He looks into the middle distance again, blowing smoke, undermining what he's just said. \"I sometimes blow my own trumpet. I'm good - I know I am. There's no point me being humble about it.\" </p> <p>Tonight Lamarr is going back to his job, the stand-up circuit. He starts in Swansea; 40 gigs later he'll hit Bedford. A grim way to spend February, March and April? \"It's not grim compared with 10 people in a room above a pub in Hackney that I used to play, and be desperate to play. I'd be excited about it all week. I'd be so excited to hitch up to London for no money and sleep on a friend's floor.\" </p> <p>That was 15 years ago. The youngest of five children, Lamarr (originally Mark Jones) was born in Swindon in 1966. His mother was a cleaner, his father a maintenance engineer in a cake factory. He left Swindon with a rockabilly quiff, the badge of a kid brought up on estates where you belonged to a tribe or you were nobody, and a desire to spit in the eye of the careers officer who told him his dream of being a journalist was \"a little bit far-fetched\". He never went to college. \"When I was 19, I was performing at university. I was younger than the people I was performing to. It sounds like I'm doing the university-of-life line now, but that's my job - being a comic - and you wouldn't learn how to do it other than by playing at university.\" </p> <p>Do you perceive yourself as a working-class bloke with a chip on his shoulder? \"Up to a point, yeah. But 'chip on his shoulder' is a reductive term for someone who cares about where they come from. You never get 'chip on your shoulder' about the upper classes - you only get it about black people or the working classes. Yeah, I'm pissed off about things, loads of things. The world isn't perfect. Comics should be poking at things - that's what good comedy is.\" Poking at things? \"If I want to do something about menstruation, then I should be allowed to - more so if that winds women up. I had years of hearing these ridiculous routines from bad women comics. Telling us how easy our life was because we didn't have periods. Really...\" </p> <p>Lamarr is nonetheless amazed to have been accused of misogyny. \"In the last month - I swear this is true - I've been called a feminist, a misogynist, gay and homophobic. I can at best be one of those things; I doubt if I'm any of them. But I haven't got the cunning to fight the public perception of me.\" It's the misogynist jibe that really irks. \"People say, 'You've made fun of Caprice and Gail Porter' and I think, 'Well, not only are they not examples of great womanhood, but I've never made fun of them for being women. Ever.' I make fun of people, you know? It would have been sexist not to make fun of Gail Porter posing nude. To treat someone as different and inferior because of their sex - that's sexism. If that's laddism then I am laddish.\" </p> <p>Still, there has been a gynaecological theme in Lamarr's stand-up that can come across as a hostile obsession. In his 1997 show he imagined the Queen drunk on gin, posed naked for a photographer with her labia dangling obscenely between her sprawled legs. That would be his dream photo for the \u00a350 note. He also told the story of a woman comic who, during her act, repeatedly walked past a table in a short skirt, while a man hissed: \"I can smell your cunt.\" For a moment, it seemed there might be a revenge punchline coming, the woman getting her own back on the heckler. Instead the heckler's female partner was portrayed as complicit, collapsed in laughter. What Lamarr seemed to like about the story was that the woman comic was trapped, unable to publicly rebuff the heckler (since it had been whispered) and unable to escape the abuse. Why tell such a story? </p> <p>During a warm-up gig in Northampton for the new tour, Lamarr unleashed some of his new material about British hostility to Europe. \"I'd set it up as obviously as I could, saying that in two years we won't be able to wake up with an alarm clock in the mornings, we'll have to have Alpine horns and an oompah band, we'll have to ski down the High Street, have sodomy with our boss, live off Battenburg and shrews and taramasalata. It was very obvious where I was coming from: I was attacking that Little Englander mentality. And people in the audience were yelling: 'Yeah! Bloody right!' I had to stop and say: 'I can't believe you've missed this point. But you have.' \" Forty nights of such misunderstandings: it could be a good tour. </p> <p>Why do people take him for a misogynist and all the other things he protests that he is not? \"A lot of the time I think it's a problem with my mode of voice rather than what I actually say. People want to assume that I'm a working-class lager lout and that's fine.\" Is it? Isn't Lamarr just affecting to be sanguine about something that must hurt? Again, the reflex self-criticism: \"I have to accept that, and I do it myself. That's the price of doing what you do in public.\" You come across as aggressive. \"Well, I think I am. But what I always think is, how does that manifest itself? It manifests itself in humour. It doesn't manifest itself in hitting someone. WC Fields used to joke that anyone who hates children can't be all bad. Does that mean he hated kids? It's a joke, for fuck's sake.\" </p> <p>Mark Lamarr plays the Grand Theatre, Swansea, tonight, then tours till April. Details: 09068 455484.</p>",

This is similar to the annualised quarter-on-quarter gains in the past couple of months and would, if sustained, suggest that consumer spending growth this year would be well above the consensus expectations.",

In the hours before the midnight deadline by which both Royal Bank of Scotland and BoS had to table their final offers, major investors indicated that they were still undecided which of the three outcomes to back - a takeover by BoS or Royal Bank, or NatWest remaining independent. However Peter Burt, chief executive of BoS, insisted shareholders had already ruled out independence for NatWest and would resist any situation in which the vote between the two Scottish assailants was split, preventing either reaching the 50% hurdle to take over NatWest. \"None of the institutions we have seen have shown any enthusiasm for a split vote. \"I think we will see a cascade effect,\" said Mr Burt, who fired the first shot in the assault on NatWest four months ago. He said his new bid was \u00a31bn higher than Royal Bank's. NatWest's board, chaired by Sir David Rowland, will meet this morning to decide whether to maintain their resistance to the two bids, contructed through a complicated mix of cash and shares, and persuade investors to give them another chance to run the bank. Viscount Younger, the chairman of Royal Bank, which has made no secret of its aim to win the agreement of the NatWest board, said: \"I've made it clear to Sir David that my door is open.\" Bankers struggled to interpret the movement in all three bank's share prices on a volatile day, blaming the uncertainty about the value of the bids on the wait until after the midnight deadline had passed. NatWest's shares fell by 92p to \u00a311.18, below the value of both bids, Royal Bank's fell by 59p to \u00a310.01 and BoS was 44p down at 620p. Royal Bank fired off its salvo in the early morning, calling on its largest shareholder, Banco Santander of Spain, to help muster some of the extra \u00a33bn cash it needed to pay for NatWest. In a complicated deal, Royal Bank offered to pay NatWest investors almost one of its own shares together with a slug of cash of between 400p and 450p and a new \"additional value share\". In a battle which has focused on how much \"cash\" is available for shareholders, Fred Goodwin, the deputy chief executive of Royal Bank, said the new terms of the deal allowed NatWest shareholders to take 514p in cash in addition to Royal Bank shares. BoS, which revealed the terms of its higher bid after the market had closed, said it could pay NatWest shareholders up to 406p in cash after calling on its financial advisors, Credit Suisse First Boston and Morgan Stanley, to underwrite new loan notes and shares for the bank. While neither of the Scottish banks was thought to have delivered a \"knock-out blow\", Mr Burt insisted that he had never been expected to do so and that the onus had been on Royal bank to pull out its \"white rabbit\". Royal Bank admitted yesterday that the next stage in the battle was to persuade shareholders to look beyond the cash component of the offers on the table and look at the choice of strategies and management instead. Sir George Mathewson, chief executive of Royal Bank, which entered the race for NatWest two months after BoS, said: \"This is the offer we think is balanced and sensible\". If NatWest survived, he said, the bank would be in \"strategic decline\".",

Mr Turner was an enthusiastic promoter of the euro and since leaving the CBI has joined the board of pro-euro lobby group Britain in Europe.

      "bodyText": "The Confederation of British Industry last night washed its hands of the government's faltering euro campaign, saying it was up to ministers to persuade the public about the benefits of UK entry to the single currency. \"The government have got to lead on this,\" Digby Jones, the CBI's new director general, said. \"They've got to win the argument.\" A spokeswoman for the organisation said that firms no longer believed Britain would enter the single currency in the short term and had told the CBI to concentrate on improving the European single market and breaking down trade barriers. The CBI's reluctance to be cheerleader for the pro-euro campaign will add to the government's woes over its policy towards the single currency. Over the weekend, Wim Duisenberg, head of the European Central Bank, warned it would be years before Britain was ready to join while a new opinion poll showed anti-euro sentiment at a record high. The CBI yesterday denied a newspaper report that its support for early euro entry was waning. \"The weight of CBI opinion supports the principle of UK membership when the economic conditions are right,\" Mr Jones said. A former lawyer, Mr Jones replaced the CBI's previous director general, Adair Turner, two months ago. Mr Turner was an enthusiastic promoter of the euro and since leaving the CBI has joined the board of pro-euro lobby group Britain in Europe. Mr Jones is on its advisory council. Mr Jones said the debate over the pros and cons of entry was becoming \"sterile\". \"The debate isn't going to be won, lost or even fought until there is a referendum, which isn't going to be for a while.\" Downing Street yesterday sought to play down Mr Jones's comments. \"The CBI is the CBI, we are the government. We have got a very clear policy which we have enunciated very clearly,\" the prime minister's official spokesman said. \"It seems to me perfectly sensible that they want businesses to be focusing on issues such as how British business can maximise the opportunities of the single currency.\" Anti-euro campaigners said the government was increasingly isolated in arguing for early entry into the euro. \"The government should now follow the CBI's lead and concentrate on the issues that actually matter to business,\" said Nick Herbert, chief executive of Business for Sterling.",

Around 155,000 employers have a company scheme, but 20% of their employees refuse to join. Most of them are young and at the lower end of the pay scales. </p> <p><strong>Why are so many peopled turned off company schemes?</strong></p> <p>They will be asked to contribute anything between 5% and 8% of their salary towards the scheme, which they think is a bit steep when there are debts and other costs to pay. </p> <p><strong>But doesn't the company chip in? </strong></p> <p>Companies usually top up the contribution to around 17% of the employees salary. If an employee is in what's called a final salary scheme, the payment every month of \u00a317 for each \u00a3100 of salary is enough to fund a pension worth two-thirds of their salary on retirement. Some companies even pay the whole lot. </p> <p><strong>It sounds like a good deal </strong></p> <p>It is. The money paid in each month by the employer is about twice the sum paid by the member of staff. A 25-year-old member of staff on the average salary of \u00a320,000 paying 6% of their salary into a scheme will fork out \u00a31,200 each year less tax relief of 100% (pension payments are paid out of income before tax). If the worker is on a salary of \u00a330,000 by the time they retire, they should receive a pension of \u00a320,000 each year. </p> <p><strong>Is there a catch? </strong></p> <p>You must pay the same amount in every month, which makes the company pension inflexible. And some companies make it difficult to transfer the pension contributions to a new employer. Many employers have also dumped their final salary schemes in favour of something called a money purchase scheme. They will often make the same generous payments and build up the same lump sum at the end, but what each individual ends up with will be left to the market. </p> <p><strong>Don't markets go up and down? </strong></p> <p>At the time of retirement the company will purchase an annuity that will aim to turn a lump sum of say \u00a3200,000 into annual payments of \u00a310,000. If the market is down one month it might only buy a pension of \u00a39,500 or up the next and be worth \u00a310,500. It's pot luck. At the moment, and for the foreseeable future, annuities rates are low. In a final salary scheme the employer must make up any shortfall. In a money purchase pension the employee takes the hit, making them unsurprisingly less popular with employees. </p> <p><strong>If they are good value overall, why does the government need to force people to take them up? </strong></p> <p>Over 5.4m adults in the UK said in a recent survey they did not know when they would be able to afford to start a pension. Many of them will be eligible for an company scheme. The government fears that when its new stakeholder pension scheme begins in 2001, employees will be tempted away from their company pensions. </p> <p>Stakeholder pensions are designed to be low cost and flexible, allowing people to pay in as little as \u00a310 per month without any penalties. Employers would have been forced to offer employees without a pension a chance to join the stakeholder version and administer it for them if they say yes. Young people and those on lower pay scales might have gone for the cheaper option even though they would have missed out on employer contributions. Under the new rules the company scheme will be a must have. </p> <p><strong>Has it always been like this? </strong></p> <p>No, it's a case of back to the future. Until 1988 membership of a company pension scheme was a condition of employment. </p> <p><strong>Why did the government change it then, if it was only going to be changed back again later? </strong></p> <p>The government, in the shape of Norman Fowler who was secretary of state for employment at the time, felt company pension schemes were a dampener on efficiency. They hindered job mobility. It was thought that someone on a company scheme would be less likely to change jobs than someone with a personal plan, so the hindrance was removed. The economic conditions at the time were also pushing many into unemployment who then found themselves tied to a poor value company scheme which they had been given no choice but to join in the first place. </p> <p><strong>Did the new regime work? </strong></p> <p>Not really. The common view is that the change was a serious mistake and paved the way for the pensions mis-selling scandal. </p> <p><strong>In what way? </strong></p> <p>The mis-selling scandal revolved round unscrupulous salesmen who persuaded their prey to pull out of their company scheme and adopt a personal pension in its place. In doing so they deprived many of the employer contributions they would otherwise have been in line for. </p> <p><strong>How many were affected by the mis-selling? </strong></p> <p>The review is still underway but in the first phase approximately 0.5m cases were unearthed. These people were deprived of \u00a311bn they would have received in company schemes and by the end of last year had been paid \u00a32.3bn in compensation. </p> <p><strong>So in future I will have to join my company scheme if I am eligible.

      "body": "<p>It's been over a decade since Loose Tubes, the collectively-run British big band, called it a day. The Tubes (who brought the world Django Bates, the Arg\u00fcelles brothers, Iain Ballamy and many others) played an all-original book and their independence blasted fresh air through the UK scene. That legacy hasn't looked like spawning a natural UK-based heir - until now. </p> <p>With 32 members, many of them symphony players, Io are even bigger - and that part of Ronnie Scott's that wasn't occupied by the band on Sunday night appeared to be mostly occupied by their nearest and dearest. But this wasn't just a party for a bunch of musicians and their families.

      "bodyText": "It's been over a decade since Loose Tubes, the collectively-run British big band, called it a day. The Tubes (who brought the world Django Bates, the Arg\u00fcelles brothers, Iain Ballamy and many others) played an all-original book and their independence blasted fresh air through the UK scene. That legacy hasn't looked like spawning a natural UK-based heir - until now. With 32 members, many of them symphony players, Io are even bigger - and that part of Ronnie Scott's that wasn't occupied by the band on Sunday night appeared to be mostly occupied by their nearest and dearest. But this wasn't just a party for a bunch of musicians and their families. Though the orchestra's potential jazz-soloist strengths are muted as yet (Bates, Ballamy, Julian Arg\u00fcelles and others were developed soloists by the 1984 launch of the Tubes), the rich textures and sharp contrasts in the ensemble writing and playing are already remarkable. When jazz ensembles use string sections, they're often bolted on, politely adding sonorities to the same riffs.
