According to sources exceedingly close to the weirdo chancellor, Gordon and Sarah Macaulay, the woman Charlie Whelan assured us he would marry, have split up.\"</p> <p>How uncanny those words sound today - especially the quote from a close political ally that \"they've just grown apart\". Others might have left it there - but oh no, not us. Two days later we were back, dismissing denials of the story and calling for a polygraph to be sent to the Treasury. \"This column has been wrong, often spectacularly, about almost everything for five years,\" I wrote. \"Not this time (we think).\" Marvellous work from the Diary You Know You Can Safely Ignore.</p> <p>\u0095 In recent months, according to the Daily Mail, \"a series of newspaper reports had suggested the relationship had gone off the boil. They may well have been part of a deliberate smokescreen.\". Yes, that's it. We were manipulated by the sinister spin machine. It wasn't sloppiness and gross incompetence, just naivety. So that's all right, then.</p> <p>\u0095 In the wake of this development, Diary pundit Steptoe asks for extra time to make his book on the \"If Mr Tony Stopped A Bus\" stakes. The world's leading canine soothsayer had Gordon as an odds-on chance at 8/11, but he will shorten when the West Highland terrier reforms his market. Also postponed is a racy extract for Paul Daniels's Under No Illusion - most inappropriate on so romantic a day.</p> <p>\u0095 Equally inappropriate would be the nasty story of revenge taken by a dentist in Melbourne, Australia, against his wife. He tied her to a chair and performed eight hours of root canal work on her teeth - without anaesthetic. Brian Sutherland's case comes up in court next month. \"She deserved every minute of it. I hope the judge sees it that way too,\" said Sutherland. I suspect not.</p> <p>\u0095 It's no surprise that the Blairs were not in church yesterday - not because of the tensions between Mr T and Gordon, but because Cherie loathes the chancellor, blaming him for the emergence of the O'Mandy Mandelson home loan story. Then again, it might be because it was a private service for family and non-political friends. How the hell would I know?</p> <p>\u0095 Moving on, lest the self-congratulation becomes cloying, we gather Channel 4 is looking for people for a special journalist series of Big Brother. So far Libby Purves, Richard Littlejohn, Janet Street-Porter, Lord Rees-Mogg, Dominic Mohan (the Sun's penis size obsessed showbiz man) and Melanie Phillips have all agreed to live in the east end house for 10 weeks, but four more volunteers are required. Applications may be sent to us in the first instance.</p> <p>\u0095 Having allowed a meaningless one-day tournament to ruin the Test series with the West Indies, the England and Wales Cricket Board contrives its coup de grace for next July. For the first time it has scheduled the highlight of the cricketing summer, the Ashes Test at Lord's, directly against the British Open. Half the MCC members will be at the golf, while Australian network, Channel 9, which carries full Open coverage, is livid. Denying deliberate sabotage, EWCB corporate affairs director John Reid insists that the cricket will hold its own against Tigermania. Of course, of course. The only mistake, in fact, with the 2001 Open at Lytham, near Blackpool, is not swapping the Lord's and Manchester Tests.</p> <p>\u0095 Finally, we wish Gordon and Sarah every happiness, and look forward to the arrival of the twins early next February. Just a little joke, to go with the P45.</p>",

According to sources exceedingly close to the weirdo chancellor, Gordon and Sarah Macaulay, the woman Charlie Whelan assured us he would marry, have split up.\" How uncanny those words sound today - especially the quote from a close political ally that \"they've just grown apart\". Others might have left it there - but oh no, not us. Two days later we were back, dismissing denials of the story and calling for a polygraph to be sent to the Treasury. \"This column has been wrong, often spectacularly, about almost everything for five years,\" I wrote. \"Not this time (we think).\" Marvellous work from the Diary You Know You Can Safely Ignore. \u0095 In recent months, according to the Daily Mail, \"a series of newspaper reports had suggested the relationship had gone off the boil. They may well have been part of a deliberate smokescreen.\". Yes, that's it. We were manipulated by the sinister spin machine. It wasn't sloppiness and gross incompetence, just naivety. So that's all right, then. \u0095 In the wake of this development, Diary pundit Steptoe asks for extra time to make his book on the \"If Mr Tony Stopped A Bus\" stakes. The world's leading canine soothsayer had Gordon as an odds-on chance at 8/11, but he will shorten when the West Highland terrier reforms his market. Also postponed is a racy extract for Paul Daniels's Under No Illusion - most inappropriate on so romantic a day. \u0095 Equally inappropriate would be the nasty story of revenge taken by a dentist in Melbourne, Australia, against his wife. He tied her to a chair and performed eight hours of root canal work on her teeth - without anaesthetic. Brian Sutherland's case comes up in court next month. \"She deserved every minute of it. I hope the judge sees it that way too,\" said Sutherland. I suspect not. \u0095 It's no surprise that the Blairs were not in church yesterday - not because of the tensions between Mr T and Gordon, but because Cherie loathes the chancellor, blaming him for the emergence of the O'Mandy Mandelson home loan story. Then again, it might be because it was a private service for family and non-political friends. How the hell would I know? \u0095 Moving on, lest the self-congratulation becomes cloying, we gather Channel 4 is looking for people for a special journalist series of Big Brother. So far Libby Purves, Richard Littlejohn, Janet Street-Porter, Lord Rees-Mogg, Dominic Mohan (the Sun's penis size obsessed showbiz man) and Melanie Phillips have all agreed to live in the east end house for 10 weeks, but four more volunteers are required. Applications may be sent to us in the first instance. \u0095 Having allowed a meaningless one-day tournament to ruin the Test series with the West Indies, the England and Wales Cricket Board contrives its coup de grace for next July. For the first time it has scheduled the highlight of the cricketing summer, the Ashes Test at Lord's, directly against the British Open. Half the MCC members will be at the golf, while Australian network, Channel 9, which carries full Open coverage, is livid. Denying deliberate sabotage, EWCB corporate affairs director John Reid insists that the cricket will hold its own against Tigermania. Of course, of course. The only mistake, in fact, with the 2001 Open at Lytham, near Blackpool, is not swapping the Lord's and Manchester Tests. \u0095 Finally, we wish Gordon and Sarah every happiness, and look forward to the arrival of the twins early next February. Just a little joke, to go with the P45.",

A 1994 case had given part-time workers the right to entry into a company pension scheme, but had left it unclear how far back they could date their claims. This week's ruling sets 1976 - the year when the relevant European legislation came into force in the UK - as the start date for claims. </p> <p>Unions scored a victory in the Luxembourg court by claiming that pension schemes were guilty of sex discrimination, because the vast majority of part-timers refused entry into company pensions were women. TUC general secretary John Monks said: \"Before this week's ruling, many of the part-time workers affected by past pensions discrimination - the majority of whom are women - faced a very uncertain future. Now, thanks to Europe, they can look forward to a much more comfortable and secure retirement.\" </p> <p>The unions, through mailings to members, had put up 60,000 industrial tribunal claims and took 22 test cases to the European Court. But initial hopes after the judgment that hundreds of thousands more might benefit have been dashed. </p> <p>The principal problem is that any part-time worker will only qualify if they have put in an industrial tribunal claim within six months of leaving employment. So someone who, say, worked from 1982-1988 part-time but did not put in a claim six months after 1988 cannot now make a claim. </p> <p>A fightback by employers has also already started. The near impossibility of tracing many former employees and their pay records back to 1976 will cut out thousands of potential beneficiaries. William Mercer, one of the biggest advisers to employers on pension schemes, said employers are also likely to go to court to alter the European ruling to apply the British limitation period of just six years of backdating. </p> <p>The broken employment patterns of the typical part-time worker will also limit the size of payouts. \"Among Britain's six million part-timers, only one in 10 is likely to have five years' service due to high staff turnover. Probably only a quarter stay with the same employer for more than two years - the minimum usually needed to qualify for preserved benefits under UK occupational pension schemes,\" said David Marshland of William Mercer. </p> <p><strong>Relief at the end of a five-year rights battle</strong></p> <p>Midland Bank expected complete flexibility from part-time cashier Rachel Harrison at its Leamington Spa branch in the late 70s and early 80s, one week asking her to work two days, the next week five, writes Patrick Collinson. But at no time did they tell her that, unlike full-time colleagues, none of her hard work would count towards a pension. </p> <p>Yesterday Mrs Harrison, 61, was celebrating the end of a five-year legal battle, waged by her union, Unifi, against Midland and other banks which banned part-time workers from joining their generous pension schemes until 1989, and which have fought tooth and nail to avoid back-dating payments. </p> <p> \"It's absolutely wonderful news for myself and other part-time workers. They expected me to be totally flexible, but were completely inflexible when it came to the pension. I was loyal, worked hard and knew I was popular with the customers. But it seemed to count for nothing,\" says Mrs Harrison, who was one of the test cases taken to the European Court of Justice. </p> <p>Midland pays Mrs Harrison a \u00a335 per week pension to cover the 11 years that she worked full-time before she was made redundant, but nothing for her seven years of part-time service. Money has been so tight that she has taken a \u00a390 per week part-time job at Warwick Hospital to supplement the small pension paid to her husband, who cannot work through illness. </p> <p>She is now waiting to hear how much extra she will gain - negotiations will take months - and hopes it will allow her to retire next year. But it will hardly pay for a rich retirement. \"All our money is spent pretty quickly. I just hope this is going to help out a bit,\" says Mrs Harrison. </p> <p><strong>The history</strong></p> <p><strong> 1972</strong> Equal Pay Act passed. Disappointment that Act failed to include pensions. </p> <p><strong> 1976</strong> Defene v Sabena establishes that equal pay for men and women is enforceable under EEC law, but no arrears of pay is required before April 1976. </p> <p><strong> 1986</strong> Bilka Kaufhaus case. Establishes that exclusion of part-time workers from pension schemes is discriminatory because majority of part-timers are women. </p> <p><strong> 1986-89</strong> UK employers gradually withdraw ban on pension scheme entry for part-timers. </p> <p><strong> 1990</strong> Barber v GRE. Pension benefits must be equal for men and women, but allows for no back-dating of claims for prior years. </p> <p><strong> 1994</strong> Coloroll case. Limits backdating of part-time pension claims to two years in UK. </p> <p><strong> 1995</strong> Unions take thousands of claims to industrial tribunals. Lose in Birmingham test case. </p> <p><strong> 1996</strong> Unions go to Court of Appeal. Defeated again. Appeal to House of Lords. </p> <p><strong> 1997</strong> European court rules favourably on Magorrian part-time pensions case in Ireland.</p> <p> <strong> 1998</strong> House of Lords refers 22 union test cases, representing 60,000 workers, to European court to clarify Magorrian ruling. </p> <p><strong> 2000</strong> European Court rules that part-time pension benefits should be back-dated to 1976. </p> <p><strong>The helplines</strong></p> <p>Union members who believe they may qualify for an enhanced pension should contact their local union branch for guidance.

So someone who, say, worked from 1982-1988 part-time but did not put in a claim six months after 1988 cannot now make a claim. A fightback by employers has also already started. The near impossibility of tracing many former employees and their pay records back to 1976 will cut out thousands of potential beneficiaries. William Mercer, one of the biggest advisers to employers on pension schemes, said employers are also likely to go to court to alter the European ruling to apply the British limitation period of just six years of backdating. The broken employment patterns of the typical part-time worker will also limit the size of payouts. \"Among Britain's six million part-timers, only one in 10 is likely to have five years' service due to high staff turnover. Probably only a quarter stay with the same employer for more than two years - the minimum usually needed to qualify for preserved benefits under UK occupational pension schemes,\" said David Marshland of William Mercer. Relief at the end of a five-year rights battle Midland Bank expected complete flexibility from part-time cashier Rachel Harrison at its Leamington Spa branch in the late 70s and early 80s, one week asking her to work two days, the next week five, writes Patrick Collinson. But at no time did they tell her that, unlike full-time colleagues, none of her hard work would count towards a pension. Yesterday Mrs Harrison, 61, was celebrating the end of a five-year legal battle, waged by her union, Unifi, against Midland and other banks which banned part-time workers from joining their generous pension schemes until 1989, and which have fought tooth and nail to avoid back-dating payments. \"It's absolutely wonderful news for myself and other part-time workers. They expected me to be totally flexible, but were completely inflexible when it came to the pension. I was loyal, worked hard and knew I was popular with the customers. But it seemed to count for nothing,\" says Mrs Harrison, who was one of the test cases taken to the European Court of Justice. Midland pays Mrs Harrison a \u00a335 per week pension to cover the 11 years that she worked full-time before she was made redundant, but nothing for her seven years of part-time service. Money has been so tight that she has taken a \u00a390 per week part-time job at Warwick Hospital to supplement the small pension paid to her husband, who cannot work through illness. She is now waiting to hear how much extra she will gain - negotiations will take months - and hopes it will allow her to retire next year. But it will hardly pay for a rich retirement. \"All our money is spent pretty quickly. I just hope this is going to help out a bit,\" says Mrs Harrison. The history 1972 Equal Pay Act passed. Disappointment that Act failed to include pensions. 1976 Defene v Sabena establishes that equal pay for men and women is enforceable under EEC law, but no arrears of pay is required before April 1976. 1986 Bilka Kaufhaus case. Establishes that exclusion of part-time workers from pension schemes is discriminatory because majority of part-timers are women. 1986-89 UK employers gradually withdraw ban on pension scheme entry for part-timers. 1990 Barber v GRE. Pension benefits must be equal for men and women, but allows for no back-dating of claims for prior years. 1994 Coloroll case. Limits backdating of part-time pension claims to two years in UK. 1995 Unions take thousands of claims to industrial tribunals. Lose in Birmingham test case. 1996 Unions go to Court of Appeal. Defeated again. Appeal to House of Lords. 1997 European court rules favourably on Magorrian part-time pensions case in Ireland. 1998 House of Lords refers 22 union test cases, representing 60,000 workers, to European court to clarify Magorrian ruling. 2000 European Court rules that part-time pension benefits should be back-dated to 1976. The helplines Union members who believe they may qualify for an enhanced pension should contact their local union branch for guidance.

A \u00a35,000 stake in a trust growing 10% each year would be worth \u00a312,969 in a no-charge fund after 10 years, \u00a312,391 in a 0.5% fund but just \u00a310,305 if annual charges hit 2.5%. Premier Asset Management holds up the Fitzrovia table with total 2.22% costs. But Premier's Peter Atkins believes this is unfair: \"We are a smaller management house so we don't get economies of scale. However, we inherited a fund with very high charges. We immediately cut them but the old fees were in the report as it was prepared under the previous owners. Many of the other funds they have chosen have special reasons why they were expensive over the past year such as the once and for all conversion to OEICs.\"",

      "trailText": "<p>A new report from the Financial Services Authority states that stocks and shares Isas can be a better bet.</p>",
      "byline": "Patrick Collinson",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It's official - don't lock your money away in a personal pension, buy a low-charge stocks and shares Isa instead. The government's financial watchdog, the Financial Services Authority shocked the pensions industry this week with a report which blows the lid off expensive personal pension plans. </p> <p>Pensions have attractive tax breaks - the money you pay in is free of tax, worth 22% for a basic rate taxpayer - but that benefit is almost exactly wiped out by the charges levied by pension companies. </p> <p>The picture is even worse if, like four out of 10 investors, you cancel your personal pension after five years. A \u00a360 per month plan is worth \u00a316,624 after five years if investments rise at 7%, but on average you lose \u00a36,324 (38% of the total) in charges, leaving your fund worth just \u00a310,300. </p> <p>The figures come from a report issued by the Financial Services Authority's central policy unit and are, therefore, completely independent of the bias common among both pension and Isa sellers. </p> <p>The authors, Malcolm Cook and Paul Johnson, conclude: \"We find that, despite the slightly more generous tax treatment available to pensions, a basic rate taxpayer can expect a greater return from investing in a CAT-standard Isa than in a median charge personal pension if the underlying investment return is the same.\" </p> <p>The report found that for every \u00a3100 of investment return produced by a CAT-standard Isa, the average personal pension produced \u00a399. If the plans are cancelled after five years, the Isa gives \u00a3100 compared to the pension's \u00a383. The balance is tilted even more in favour of Isas because they have greater flexibility than pensions. </p> <p>The report says: \"Any money one puts in an Isa can be accessed as and when required, with no restrictions on how it is then used or invested. By contrast, pension monies can be accessed only after age 50 and then three-quarters of them have to be converted into an annuity. </p> <p>\"So faced with a choice between an Isa and a pension, each of which promised a return of 100, one would have a clear incentive to choose an Isa,\" the authors say. </p> <p>But before the unit trust industry starts crowing about their low charges compared to pensions, the report contains some important caveats. </p> <p>The only Isas to beat average personal pensions are those which are CAT-marked - the ones which meet the government's cost, access and terms standards - and only a few do.

      "bodyText": "It's official - don't lock your money away in a personal pension, buy a low-charge stocks and shares Isa instead. The government's financial watchdog, the Financial Services Authority shocked the pensions industry this week with a report which blows the lid off expensive personal pension plans. Pensions have attractive tax breaks - the money you pay in is free of tax, worth 22% for a basic rate taxpayer - but that benefit is almost exactly wiped out by the charges levied by pension companies. The picture is even worse if, like four out of 10 investors, you cancel your personal pension after five years. A \u00a360 per month plan is worth \u00a316,624 after five years if investments rise at 7%, but on average you lose \u00a36,324 (38% of the total) in charges, leaving your fund worth just \u00a310,300. The figures come from a report issued by the Financial Services Authority's central policy unit and are, therefore, completely independent of the bias common among both pension and Isa sellers. The authors, Malcolm Cook and Paul Johnson, conclude: \"We find that, despite the slightly more generous tax treatment available to pensions, a basic rate taxpayer can expect a greater return from investing in a CAT-standard Isa than in a median charge personal pension if the underlying investment return is the same.\" The report found that for every \u00a3100 of investment return produced by a CAT-standard Isa, the average personal pension produced \u00a399. If the plans are cancelled after five years, the Isa gives \u00a3100 compared to the pension's \u00a383. The balance is tilted even more in favour of Isas because they have greater flexibility than pensions. The report says: \"Any money one puts in an Isa can be accessed as and when required, with no restrictions on how it is then used or invested. By contrast, pension monies can be accessed only after age 50 and then three-quarters of them have to be converted into an annuity. \"So faced with a choice between an Isa and a pension, each of which promised a return of 100, one would have a clear incentive to choose an Isa,\" the authors say. But before the unit trust industry starts crowing about their low charges compared to pensions, the report contains some important caveats. The only Isas to beat average personal pensions are those which are CAT-marked - the ones which meet the government's cost, access and terms standards - and only a few do. Indeed, the average unit trust comes out worse in the survey than the average pension. Higher rate taxpayers, who enjoy 40% tax relief on their pension contributions, also do better than Isa holders over the longer term. The pensions which are slated are personal pensions, not occupational pensions, which are almost guaranteed to outstrip Isas by a wide margin because of the impact of employers' contributions. Additional voluntary contributions on company pensions are also far more attractive that taking out an Isa. Axa Sun Life, a major pension seller, adds that the figures should be treated cautiously. Head of pensions development Paul Smith says: \"It will not always be right in each and every case that an Isa is better. It depends on the terms and conditions of each policy, the company that runs it, the actual investment performance and so on. \"And while Isas are flexible, that can work both ways. With an Isa you may be tempted to cash it in early to access the money, leaving you with no retirement income at all.\" The authors of the FSA report stress that the picture will change dramatically when stakeholder pensions become available in April next year. Because stakeholder pensions will have a maximum annual charge of 1%, compared to 4%-5% on some high charge personal pensions, they will offer investors the best returns. The FSA projects that a \u00a360 per month stakeholder pension will pay out \u00a340,392 after 25 years (assuming 7% investment growth), compared to \u00a337,200 for the average personal pension. \"Introducing stakeholders with tightly defined charging criteria could potentially be an important step in increasing the relative attractiveness of pension saving. But whether stakeholder pensions will provide enough incentive for those who do not want to save remains open to question,\" conclude the authors.",

Bob Mendelsohn - who during his two-year tenure as chief executive has faced repeated takeover rumours - said: \"We've turned a corner in the public's perception.\" </p> <p>The insurance group's shares - which have lagged behind the overall market by more than 20% - rose 3% to 430p after it reported a \u00a35m rise in operating profits to \u00a3320m in the first six months of the year.</p> <p>\"We're pleased that the market is recognising the enormous step on the journey we've taken to the goals we'd set ourselves,\" he said. Royal &amp; Sun Alliance has set itself a target to reach an operating ratio - a measure of efficiency - of 103 by 2001, still some distance from the 107.6 level at which it stood yesterday.</p> <p>Mr Mendelsohn insisted, however, that the insurer would meet that goal and would adopt a \"fix or eliminate\" on any part of its business which might hinder its achievement.</p> <p>The group has made a number of acquisitions recently, including Orion in the US and Trygg-Hansa in Scandinavia, and Mr Mendelsohn made it clear that further deals would be considered in its core markets of Britain, the US, Canada, Scandinavia and Australia.</p> <p>Unlike its rival, CGNU, which revealed this week that it had been battered by storm damage in France, Royal &amp; Sun Alliance took the pain last year, Mr Mendelsohn said. However, he admitted storms in Denmark earlier in the year had cost \u00a35m.</p> <p>He also said the group had not yet decided whether to begin negotiations with market regulators about how to distribute its \u00a31bn \"orphan\" estate - as Axa Sun Life recently did, pledging payments to policyholders.</p> <p>Mr Mendelsohn said that the insurer was able to charge higher premiums in most of the markets in which it operates for the first time in many years. In Britain, however, the higher cost it was charging for motor insurance had led to a 6% fall in its general insurance premiums.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Royal &amp; Sun Alliance yesterday claimed to be showing progress along its rocky road to recovery after a difficult merger three years ago. Bob Mendelsohn - who during his two-year tenure as chief executive has faced repeated takeover rumours - said: \"We've turned a corner in the public's perception.\" The insurance group's shares - which have lagged behind the overall market by more than 20% - rose 3% to 430p after it reported a \u00a35m rise in operating profits to \u00a3320m in the first six months of the year. \"We're pleased that the market is recognising the enormous step on the journey we've taken to the goals we'd set ourselves,\" he said. Royal &amp; Sun Alliance has set itself a target to reach an operating ratio - a measure of efficiency - of 103 by 2001, still some distance from the 107.6 level at which it stood yesterday. Mr Mendelsohn insisted, however, that the insurer would meet that goal and would adopt a \"fix or eliminate\" on any part of its business which might hinder its achievement. The group has made a number of acquisitions recently, including Orion in the US and Trygg-Hansa in Scandinavia, and Mr Mendelsohn made it clear that further deals would be considered in its core markets of Britain, the US, Canada, Scandinavia and Australia. Unlike its rival, CGNU, which revealed this week that it had been battered by storm damage in France, Royal &amp; Sun Alliance took the pain last year, Mr Mendelsohn said. However, he admitted storms in Denmark earlier in the year had cost \u00a35m. He also said the group had not yet decided whether to begin negotiations with market regulators about how to distribute its \u00a31bn \"orphan\" estate - as Axa Sun Life recently did, pledging payments to policyholders. Mr Mendelsohn said that the insurer was able to charge higher premiums in most of the markets in which it operates for the first time in many years. In Britain, however, the higher cost it was charging for motor insurance had led to a 6% fall in its general insurance premiums.",

Adam Hollioake, who had been dropped at mid-on by Glen Chapple on 40, responded by driving Keedy over mid-off for six. Then he cut a short and wide ball from Scuderi for four. The next ball was even wider, but pitched up, and Hollioake pursued and was caught behind.",

</p> <p>250-299 (2); </p> <p>300-349 (3); </p> <p>350-399 (4); </p> <p>400 or over (5) </p> <p><strong> Bowling: now only 3 points available </strong> (4) </p> <p>three-five wickets (1); </p> <p>six-eight wickets (2); </p> <p>nine-ten (3). </p> <p>The new ball can still be taken after 100 overs. </p> <p>A no ball is worth two runs to the batting side; runs scored off a no ball count in addition to the two-run penalty. </p> <p>A single-innings match may be played when bad weather prevents any start until less than eight hours remain. A win earns 12 points, a tie six and a draw three but there are no bonus points. </p> <p>*Note: in a <strong> draw where the scores finish level</strong> , the side batting in the fourth innings earn 6 points their opponents 4, plus bonus points. </p> <p><strong> NATIONAL LEAGUE</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Northamptonshire v Worcestershire </strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> WORCESTERSHIRE</strong> </p> <p><strong> P R Pollard</strong> run out <strong> 3 </strong></p> <p><strong>W P C Weston</strong> c Bailey b Taylor <strong> 15 </strong></p> <p><strong>V S Solanki</strong> lbw b Cousins <strong> 3 </strong></p> <p><strong>D A Leatherdale</strong> c &amp; b Swann <strong> 40 </strong></p> <p><strong>E J Wilson</strong> c Bailey b Penberthy <strong> 5 </strong></p> <p><strong>R C Driver</strong> c Taylor b Penberthy <strong> 2 </strong></p> <p><strong>*S J Rhodes</strong> c Loye b Swann <strong> 43 </strong></p> <p><strong>S R Lampitt</strong> c Bailey b Cousins <strong> 39 </strong></p> <p><strong>R K Illingworth</strong> run out <strong> 6 </strong></p> <p><strong>Kabir Ali</strong> not out <strong> 2 </strong></p> <p><strong>G D McGrath</strong> not out <strong> 0</strong></p> <p><strong>Extras</strong> (b3 lb8 w10) <strong> 21 </strong></p> <p><strong>Total</strong> (for 9, 45 overs) <strong> 179 </strong></p> <p><strong>Fall:</strong> 14, 26, 30, 50, 56, 83, 156, 176, 178. </p> <p><strong> Bowling:</strong> Cousins 9-1-29-2; Taylor 9-1-27-1; Penberthy 9-0-37-2; Brown 9-1-32-0; Swann 9-0-43-2. </p> <p><strong> NORTHAMPTONSHIRE </strong> (Early score) </p> <p><strong> A S Rollins</strong> lbw b Leatherdale <strong> 13 </strong></p> <p><strong>M B Loye</strong> not out <strong> 23 </strong></p> <p><strong>J W Cook</strong> not out <strong> 0</strong></p> <p><strong>Extras</strong> (w3) <strong> 3 </strong></p> <p><strong>Total</strong> (for 1, 11.1 overs) <strong> 39 </strong></p> <p><strong>Fall:</strong> 39. </p> <p><strong> To bat:</strong> D J G Sales, G P Swann, R J Warren, *A L Penberthy, TT M B Bailey, J P Taylor, D M Cousins, J F Brown. </p> <p><strong> Umpires: </strong> D J Constant and J W Lloyds. </p> <p><strong> SECOND TEST</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Sri Lanka v South Africa</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> SRI LANKA:</strong> First innings 308 (M S Atapattu 120, A Ranatunga 54). </p> <p><strong> SOUTH AFRICA:</strong> First innings 253 (L Klusener 118no, M V Boucher 60). </p> <p><strong> SOUTH AFRICA</strong> <strong> Second innings </strong> (overnight: 192-8) </p> <p><strong> N Boje</strong> c Sub b Chandana <strong> 27 </strong></p> <p><strong>P R Adams</strong> not out <strong> 14 </strong></p> <p><strong>M Hayward</strong> lbw b Chandana <strong> 0 </strong></p> <p><strong>Extras</strong> (b7 lb1 nb3) <strong> 11 </strong></p> <p><strong>Total</strong> (93.5 overs) <strong> 231 </strong></p> <p><strong>Fall cont:</strong> 231. </p> <p><strong> Bowling:</strong> Vaas 14-6-17-1; Zoysa 5-0-17-1; Dharmasena 16-2-47-1; Muralitharan 36-8-76-3; Chandana 9.5-0-21-2; Jayasuriya 13-1-45-2. </p> <p><strong> SRI LANKA</strong> <strong> Second innings </strong></p> <p><strong>M S Atapattu</strong> lbw b Pollock <strong> 0</strong></p> <p><strong>S T Jayasuriya</strong> lbw b Hayward <strong> 0</strong></p> <p><strong>R P Arnold</strong> lbw b Boje <strong> 40 </strong></p> <p><strong>D P M Jayawardene</strong> c Boucher b Hayward <strong> 1 </strong></p> <p><strong>K Sangakkara</strong> c Hayward b Kallis <strong> 5 </strong></p> <p><strong>A Ranatunga</strong> c Rhodes b Boje <strong> 88 </strong></p> <p><strong>H D P Dharmasena</strong> c Rhodes b Klusener <strong> 1 </strong></p> <p><strong>U D U Chandana</strong> b Klusener <strong> 16 </strong></p> <p><strong>W P U Vaas</strong> run out <strong> 5 </strong></p> <p><strong>D N T Zoysa</strong> not out <strong> 2 </strong></p> <p><strong>M Muralitharan</strong> c Boucher b Boje <strong> 0</strong></p> <p><strong>Extras</strong> (b1 lb6 w2 nb2) <strong> 11 </strong></p> <p><strong>Total</strong> (50.1 overs) <strong> 169 </strong></p> <p><strong>Fall:</strong> 0, 5, 9, 21, 130, 133, 161, 161, 169. </p> <p><strong> Bowling:</strong> Pollock 11-4-38-1; Hayward 5-1-15-2; Kallis 8-1-25-1; Adams 3-1-26-0; Klusener 13-3-34-2; Boje 10.1-4-24-3. </p> <p><strong> Umpires:</strong> D J Harper and G Silva. </p> <p><strong> South Africa won by seven runs.</strong> </p> <p><strong> WORLD UNDER-15 CHALLENGE</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> League </strong> A (Eton College): England 166.

As before, a win earns 12 points , a tie 6 , a normal draw 4 (see later *) and a defeat none, plus any bonus points accrued for batting and bowling in each first innings. Bonus points are now reckoned on the score in the first 130 overs, not 120 overs as in recent seasons. Batting: now 5 pts can be earned (4 last year) 200 -249 runs (1pt); 250-299 (2); 300-349 (3); 350-399 (4); 400 or over (5) Bowling: now only 3 points available (4) three-five wickets (1); six-eight wickets (2); nine-ten (3). The new ball can still be taken after 100 overs. A no ball is worth two runs to the batting side; runs scored off a no ball count in addition to the two-run penalty. A single-innings match may be played when bad weather prevents any start until less than eight hours remain. A win earns 12 points, a tie six and a draw three but there are no bonus points. *Note: in a draw where the scores finish level , the side batting in the fourth innings earn 6 points their opponents 4, plus bonus points.

No one reading Barbara Follett's recent cri de coeur - \"It is time to put an end to this nonsense. No more shillyshallying, no more excuses\" - or Oona King's no less stirring attack on \"the world's most luxurious prison\", or Joan Ruddock's modernisation-or-dishonour piece in the Guardian this week, can doubt either the passion or the effectiveness of these women once they encounter an injustice that is equal to their eloquence.</p> <p>And the enormity that finally moved them to action? The abuse that could no longer be tolerated? Why, their own working conditions. These, as King pointed out, can be arduous. \"Important legislation affecting millions of lives is routinely discussed in the middle of the night.\" Very worrying. Or it would be if discussion in the House of Commons were not, as the attendance at these discussions suggests, superfluous. \"How awake are you at 4am?\", King continued. Not very, as many regular shift-workers, from factory shift workers to casualty nurses, would no doubt testify. What makes it all worse, as Follett explained, is that the Tories sometimes keep the Labour voters up all night out of pure mischief: \"We resent being taken away from our real work by the childish behaviour of a handful of parliamentary pranksters.\" Quite. Just as the Tories must have resented it a few years ago when the then Labour opposition gleefully got up to exactly the same sort of tricks. Ruddock discloses that she has been campaigning for change ever since she arrived in 1987. \"Our priority,\" she writes of the modernisers, \"is effectiveness . . . We cannot - and should not - divorce chamber and constituency. Nor should we have to live lives divorced from our families and friends.\"</p> <p>Absolutely. Perhaps it is time to increase MPs' 17 weeks' holiday a year to something more consistent with the demands of modern friendship and parenting. But Ruddock and her fellow modernisers do not stop there. \"I want a 21st-century speaker,\" Ruddock demands, \"who shares my vision of a modern parliament with modern procedures and sensible hours in a redesigned semi-circular chamber in which every member has a seat and a mechanism for electronic voting.\" This may seem ambitious, but if the recent achievements of the modernisers are anything to go by, it is by no means unrealistic. Who could have predicted, a year or so ago, that attitudes to breastfeeding in committee would be a decisive factor in the election of the next speaker? Or guessed that the enhancement of their own working conditions would become, for so many MPs, an all-consuming preoccupation, a subject for petitions and threatened walkouts, a cause that is, if I understand King, the one reason some women MPs choose to battle on - \"to change this system for good\".</p> <p>It is done, naturally, for the purest of motives. If women MPs are allowed to breastfeed during the longeurs of their job, then it cannot be long before non-MPs are asserting their right to have their babies brought to the office for nursing. If parliament is to enjoy - or regain - public esteem, the reformers argue, highmindedly, it must provide a model of modernity and family-friendliness. Anne Campbell, the MP for Cambridge, who organised a petition signed by 210 MPs calling for reformed hours, says the current regime \"sends out the message that Parliament is out of touch\". Though not quite so out of touch, perhaps, as a parliament which appears so exclusively absorbed with its own physical and social well-being. If there is any truth in the surveys showing British workers to be the most stressed and overworked, the most unhappy and downtrodden of all the drones in Europe, then maybe parliamentary hours - to remain in touch - should stay just the way they are?</p> <p>Still, all this agitation must make the backbench modernisers feel that they are, at least, doing something. Michel Houellebecq, in his impressive novel, Atomised, describes the behaviour of frustrated animals. \"When unable to find food, for example, pigeons ( columba livia ) will frequently peck the ground even if there is nothing there which is edible. Not only will they forage indiscriminately, but they start to preen their feathers such inappropriate behaviour, frequently observed in situations of frustration or conflict, is known as displacement activity.\"</p> <p>So, it seems, frustrated backbenchers, denied any influence in government, will try to assert themselves with campaigns relating only to their personal comfort and prestige. Some forget themselves to the extent that they believe they were elected to pursue this very displacement activity.</p> <p>Unfortunately, among MPs as opposed to pigeons, this behaviour is not merely inappropriate but counter-productive: the more self-consciously \"modern\" they try to be, the more the modernisers seem mystifyingly solipsistic. And if it ever comes true, Ruddock's glorious vision of a \"redesigned semi-circular chamber in which every member has a seat\" could be the end of the place. There is, after all, already a place with not one but two semi-circular chambers, with seats and rooms and showers for everyone and electronic gadgets and every possible modern parliamentary contrivance. Modernity, as the up-to-the-minute European parliament proves every day, need not mean effectiveness. Sometimes it just means blond wood, expense accounts and something called the democratic deficit.</p>",

If they left the standard of the Premier League would collapse.\"</p> <p>Brooking instead blamed lack of investment at the grassroots level for the game's current malaise. \"We have ignored the grass roots for 20 years,\" he said. Last week, Sport England announced a \u00a390m initiative to support the foundations of football, but Brooking warned results would be a long time in coming. \"The work we are doing now will take five years for the first signs to show and 10 before the real benefits are felt,\" he said.</p> <p>In a veiled swipe at Charles Hughes, technical director of the FA during the 1980s, Brooking claimed that \"kick and rush\" football also had its part to play in England's demise. \"The standard of football it produced was dire and it was awful to watch,\" he said. \"Kick and rush spread down to the grassroots and scouts were being told to look for big, strong, hulking youngsters. Anyone who was small was almost completely ignored, yet ability and technique more than make up for a lack of inches.\"</p> <p>\"We have to put something back into the primary schools because the ages between five and seven are the most impressionable for any youngster,\" Brooking claimed. The Football Foundation will provide extra equipment for clubs and schools, but Brooking believes the standard of teaching must also improve. \"Unfortunately, there are some primary teachers taking sports classes who have only had six hours training themselves, \" he said. \"If nobody can show these kids how to kick a ball, they will never get any better and then will switch off completely. Once that happens we have lost them, which is a travesty.\"</p>",

If they left the standard of the Premier League would collapse.\" Brooking instead blamed lack of investment at the grassroots level for the game's current malaise. \"We have ignored the grass roots for 20 years,\" he said. Last week, Sport England announced a \u00a390m initiative to support the foundations of football, but Brooking warned results would be a long time in coming. \"The work we are doing now will take five years for the first signs to show and 10 before the real benefits are felt,\" he said. In a veiled swipe at Charles Hughes, technical director of the FA during the 1980s, Brooking claimed that \"kick and rush\" football also had its part to play in England's demise. \"The standard of football it produced was dire and it was awful to watch,\" he said. \"Kick and rush spread down to the grassroots and scouts were being told to look for big, strong, hulking youngsters. Anyone who was small was almost completely ignored, yet ability and technique more than make up for a lack of inches.\" \"We have to put something back into the primary schools because the ages between five and seven are the most impressionable for any youngster,\" Brooking claimed. The Football Foundation will provide extra equipment for clubs and schools, but Brooking believes the standard of teaching must also improve. \"Unfortunately, there are some primary teachers taking sports classes who have only had six hours training themselves, \" he said. \"If nobody can show these kids how to kick a ball, they will never get any better and then will switch off completely. Once that happens we have lost them, which is a travesty.\"",

Instead, some of the forces, such as West Yorkshire, that are under greatest pressure to recruit and retain more police, are seeing falling numbers of ethnic officers. On average, police forces need to recruit an additional 826 officers a year to meet the 10-year targets set by the Home Office. But over the year to this March there were only 209 more officers from ethnic minorities. The forces that need to recruit the majority of additional officers - the Metropolitan police, and West Midlands, Greater Manchester, and West Yorkshire - are all failing to meet their targets. In West Yorkshire, the number of officers from minority ethnic communities has fallen over the past two years from 133 to 127. At this rate of progress, the forces where further minority ethnic recruitment is needed most, will fail to meet the government's targets. Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman who compiled the figures from parliamentary written answers, said the figures were \"very disappointing\". In the two years between March 1998 and March this year, the number of ethnic minority officers rose from 2,483 to 2,754. But police forces need an increase of 8,265 officers at an average of 826 a year to meet the home secretary's 10-year goal.

The Home Office hopes a rapid expansion of the police service, as heralded in recent budget announcements, will provide a timely chance to recruit from ethnic minorities. Ministers have admitted that the \"canteen culture\" inside police forces needs to be dispelled not only to attract ethnic minorities but keep them. The figures show the Met needs an average of 566 officers each year to meet its target. Between March last year and March this year, there were only an additional 125 officers. Their target is to increase the proportion to 25.5% by 2006. The present strength is only 4%. The West Midlands force needs an average of 86 additional officers a year. Between March 1999 and this March, there were only an additional 17 officers; the target is to have a police force with a 16% ethnic minority by 2009. Greater Manchester needs an average 35 additional officers a year, but in the same two years achieved four extra officers. Meanwhile, West Yorkshire, needing an average 34 extra officers, had four fewer in the time period. Officers from ethnic minorities make up 3% of this region's police strength; the target is for 9.4% by 2009. The Home Office has defended the slow increase saying there is no need for the targets to be achieved by equal annual increments. The target for retention is that the percentage of ethnic minority officers resigning or dismissed should equal the percentage of white officers leaving.

The four were arrested on Tuesday on Mount Cakor, on the border between Montenegro and Kosovo. The Yugoslav army said that military equipment and explosives had been found in their possession. The Serbian authorities, who command the Yugoslav army, recently alleged that special British forces and other foreign experts were training the Montenegrin paramilitary police force in preparation for the pro-western republic's secession from Yugoslavia. \"There are indications that the arrested foreigners were training special units of Montenegrin police and that they are specialists for explosives and terrorist actions,\" the military said in a statement. The ruling Montenegrin Democratic party of Socialists said that by claiming that foreign instructors were training Montenegrin troops, the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, and his allies were trying to \"prepare ground for a physical assault on Montenegro ... and the elimination of its democratic leadership\". The arrests come amid fears in Montenegro that the Yugoslav army may try to oust the republic's government ahead of Yugoslav elections in September - polls that the leadership has vowed to boycott. Yugoslav authorities - who have been stepping up anti-western propaganda ahead of the vote - announced on Monday that four Dutchmen had been arrested in Yugoslavia in July for allegedly plotting to assassinate Mr Milosevic. There have been allegations that that Nato has hired mercenaries to snatch war-crimes suspects on Yugoslav territory and bring them to the UN war crimes tribunal in the Hague. In Vienna, a spokesman for the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe said that two Britons working as instructors at the OSCE-run Kosovo police academy in Vucitrn had been missing since Tuesday and were believed to have been with two Canadian aid workers.",

Think how lucky Pierluigi Casiraghi is, then, to have Kuddly Ken Bates. For nearly two years, Chelsea's Italian striker has been battling to save his career after suffering a horrendous knee injury against West Ham. He's recently undergone a morale-sapping tenth operation, so who knows what state he'd be in had Karing Ken not announced to the world that his career is over and Chelsea will stop paying his wages next month (after serving notice on a contract which still had two years to run).</p> <p>\"Casiraghi won't be playing any more,\" Konsiderate Ken announced with a tear in his eye. \"We have been paid \u00a34,050,000 insurance, which will mean he can't play top-level football again.\" This heartfelt speech comes a week after Casiraghi had accused the club of showing little interest in his progress, a charge Bates hotly denies: \"We gave him 20 months, but he was still walking with a limp, so we had no choice.\"</p> <p>Whether Chelsea really did have \"no choice\" is a moot point, however. \"Of course it was a very, very bad injury and there is only a slim chance of him making a comeback,\" Casiraghi's agent Fabio Parisi said today, \"but we consider it is still too early to say he will not. It looks strange that Chelsea should collect the money without Gigi's consent.\" Parisi, who claims that an independent medical report should have been completed, has lodged an appeal with the Premier League on behalf of his client, and hasn't ruled out going to the civil courts. It's a terrible business which could turn unpleasant - so if Ken feels he needs a cuddle himself, he knows where to find us.</p> <p><strong>GREG THE PEG</strong></p> <p>Aston Villa went out of European competition last night, pretty much before it had even started, going down 2-1 at home to Celta Vigo in the semi-finals of the Intertoto Cup. This, in terms of European milestones, is about as significant as an EU directive on the size of men's turn-ups. So is it any wonder that John Gregory, football's Mr Angry, got a little hot under the collar over events?</p> <p>\"If the ref's last name is Shocker,\" said Greg of referee Shoch, who handed out three red cards and eight yellow during the game, \"then his first name should be Hadda.\" Great stuff. And funny too. \"The referee was unbelievably petty. If there were rules and regulations, he stuck to the letter of the law,\" Greg went on, as if this was a bad thing.</p> <p>With steam beginning to make its way out of his mouth as well as his ears, Greg then turned his attentions to his own players. Asked whether the arrival of David Ginola would persuade Southgate, Ehiogu et al to stay on at Villa Park, Greg said: \"Frankly I don't care. If people want to leave here then in my opinion it is their loss. If they want to go, then go, providing we are compensated in the right manner.\" All this on the same day that his chairman, Dashing Doug Ellis, said of Southgate: \"As far as I'm concerned he is under contract for a further three years and I'd like him to stay.\" Looks like things are warming up nicely for the new season. And to think Villa are only 100-1 for the title.</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"He has arrived with a big reputation. I am told he is as big as Alan Shearer in Saudi, and he has looked very smart in training\" - Wolves' manager Colin Lee talks up the elbowing, sorry, striking skills of 'The Blue Fox', Saudi Arabian international Sami Al-Jaber, currently on trial at Molineux.</p> <p><strong>OWEN NOT GOIN'</strong></p> <p>Michael Owen wants to make it quite clear that he's as \"happy as he's ever been\" at Liverpool. And he certainly doesn't want to leave. Oh no. And to prove his loyalty, England's boy wonder suddenly announced today that he'd be \"delighted to discuss a new contract\" - despite having three years left on his present one. My, the lad's keen! And anyone who dares suggest that he's using Real Madrid's reported \u00a325m interest to bump his contract to Rivaldo-like levels with get very short shrift from us. Alright?</p> <p>\"I've still got three years left on my current contract, and I'm as happy as I've ever been at Liverpool,\" said Owen. \"But if Liverpool decide they want me for even longer, I'd be delighted to discuss it.\" And he had a special message for Madrid president and construction magnate Florentino Perez, who last month admitted he was \"enchanted\" by Liverpool's no.10 - well, he is an attractive lad - and has been after him ever since. </p> <p>\"When you see things like that it means two things,\" said an earnest Owen. \"First I can come out and say I'm flattered. But on the other hand I'm not happy because I don't want it to cause a problem with Liverpool fans.\" And to make his point, Owen reiterated his commitment to Gerald Houllier's side. \"I'm very proud to play for Liverpool and have no intention of leaving.

I can understand why people want a restriction on the number of foreign players but they have come in because we do not have sufficient players of that quality,\" he went on. \"If they left the standard of the Premier League would collapse.

      "body": "<p>If you've ever had reason to complain to a large company about a problem you've encountered - perhaps taking issue with an inferior product or service, or about the way your case was handled - you'll know how frustrating it can be. </p> <p>A select few firms have excellent customer service and complaints operations, rapidly resolving and compensating customers for the hassle and inconvenience they have experienced. But too many seem hell-bent on refusing to resolve and recompense customers who feel they have been cheated, wronged or poorly treated. And, while many industries, such as the travel trade, do have recognised complaints organisations many consumers understandably feel less than pleased with the way their case has been handled. Take the case of Steve Pardoe (<a href=\"http://www.pardoes.com\">www.pardoes.com</a>) and his ongoing battle against BT Cellnet. </p> <p>Early in 1999, Pardoe was amazed to find his Barclaycard had been debited by Cellnet (now BT Cellnet) for \u00a350. The debit was unauthorised and, as a result, he contacted Cellnet, only to get, what he claimed was, rather unsympathetic handling. After contacting Barclaycard, who were more helpful, he had his account credited with the unauthorised debit. When two further debits of \u00a350 appeared on his statement, Pardoe cancelled his Barclaycard, which he says was less than convenient, as he was about to travel and so needed a credit card. </p> <p>What annoyed Pardoe most was that BT Cellnet was at the time apparently unable to prevent its prepaid cellular customers from using his card number and expiry date to get call credit on their mobiles. </p> <p>Because of Cellnet's poor response to his original complaint, Pardoe - described by one cellular trade magazine as \"Mr Angry\" - has staged a one-man campaign on the web to publicise the mobile network's loopholes in its security procedures. BT Cellnet has tried to deal with the problem by making sure that any new mobile phone owners have to register their debit or credit card number when they buy a mobile phone. Pardoe remains incensed, as witnessed by an ongoing campaign on his site, much to BT Cellnet's annoyance. BT Cellnet now appears to have realised - too late - that it handled Pardoe's case with less than its usual level of professionalism, and is now reaping the negative publicity rewards. </p> <p>According to Alan Stevens, digital media specialist with the Consumer's Association (<a href=\"http://www.which.net\">www.which.net</a>) and editor of Which? magazine, cases like Pardoe's, and the Dump the Pump campaign (<a href=\"http://www.boycott-the-pumps.com\">www.boycott-the-pumps.com</a>) against high petrol prices, show that, thanks to the web, consumers are becoming empowered against large organisations. There are plenty of other instances where consumers have used the internet to complain about services. </p> <p>The \"Flaming Ford\" site (<a href=\"http://www.flamingfords.com\">www.flamingfords.com</a>) for example, started when a Ford owner, who claimed his car burst into flames, complained to the company only to be told that his was the only case they had encountered. When the irate owner posted his grievances on the web he was contacted by other \"Flaming Ford\" owners and the campaign really took off. A class action against Ford is currently being heavily disputed. </p> <p>The Consumer's Association, has also used the power of the web to stage its own campaign. Alongside its <a href=\"http://www.which.net\">www.which.net</a> site, the CA has opened a campaign site at <a href=\"http://www.carbusters.com\">www.carbusters.com,</a> to highlight the extra costs of buying a car - almost any car - in the UK, comparing the prices that continental motorists pay. </p> <p>Before you turn to the web to air your grievances, make sure you have explored the normal avenues of complaint, and ensured your complaint is valid, advise the Consumer's Association. Alistair Kelman, a barrister who specialises in IT law, warns of the legal consequences of a badly-thought-out web campaign. \"Consumer's tales have a habit of becoming embroidered, and the danger is that customers can end up libelling another person, or more usually, a company, with their campaigning web site.\" </p> <p>It is easier for companies to show damage to their trading reputation. \"This makes it relatively easy for a company to take action against someone posting incorrect or untruthful allegations on their web sites. Users should take care to only report the facts, referring to copies of their correspondence or email on their site, which they can also post.\" By referring to correspondence or emails with the company in question, and sticking to the facts, and the facts only, you shouldn't go too far wrong. </p> <p>So how easy (and expensive) is it to wage a legitimate campaign against a major company or organisation you feel has wronged you? Provided you have explored all normal avenues of complaint and have got nowhere, or have not received a sensible and satisfactory response, the answer is - very easy, and relatively cheap. </p> <p>The last 12 months has seen the cost of registering and maintaining a web site on an Internet company's servers tumble from a relatively great height. UK2Net (<a href=\"http://www.uk2.net\">www.uk2.net</a>), which claims to be the largest web hosting company in the UK, currently with 435,000 registered users, charges just \u00a38.98 for a year's basic registration on its servers. </p> <p>In return for this modest fee, you get your own registered web domain, plus email forwarding. On top of this, you'll pay from around \u00a310 a year for hosting (storing) your web pages on UK2net's servers, with the internet firm offering to publicise your site via a variety of search engines for free. </p> <p>You can also upload and maintain your own web pages via your existing internet service provider (ISP), usually for free, although usually with a less than obvious address. Another company, Free Parking, (www. freeparking.co.uk) will register, park and manage your pages for free, although you'll also have to allow the service's adverts on your pages. </p> <p>Creating and editing your site is also surprisingly easy, as Microsoft's Internet Explorer (<a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com\">www.microsoft.com</a>), the free Internet browser and email package that most internet kits come with, includes a page editing and upload package called Front Page Express. </p> <p>Front Page Express, like Internet Explorer, is free to download and use from the Microsoft site. You can also use it to interact with your internet company's servers. All you pay is the usual cost of accessing the internet, which for most users amounts to a local phone call.</p>",

Before you turn to the web to air your grievances, make sure you have explored the normal avenues of complaint, and ensured your complaint is valid, advise the Consumer's Association. Alistair Kelman, a barrister who specialises in IT law, warns of the legal consequences of a badly-thought-out web campaign. \"Consumer's tales have a habit of becoming embroidered, and the danger is that customers can end up libelling another person, or more usually, a company, with their campaigning web site.\" It is easier for companies to show damage to their trading reputation. \"This makes it relatively easy for a company to take action against someone posting incorrect or untruthful allegations on their web sites. Users should take care to only report the facts, referring to copies of their correspondence or email on their site, which they can also post.\" By referring to correspondence or emails with the company in question, and sticking to the facts, and the facts only, you shouldn't go too far wrong. So how easy (and expensive) is it to wage a legitimate campaign against a major company or organisation you feel has wronged you? Provided you have explored all normal avenues of complaint and have got nowhere, or have not received a sensible and satisfactory response, the answer is - very easy, and relatively cheap. The last 12 months has seen the cost of registering and maintaining a web site on an Internet company's servers tumble from a relatively great height. UK2Net (www.uk2.net), which claims to be the largest web hosting company in the UK, currently with 435,000 registered users, charges just \u00a38.98 for a year's basic registration on its servers. In return for this modest fee, you get your own registered web domain, plus email forwarding. On top of this, you'll pay from around \u00a310 a year for hosting (storing) your web pages on UK2net's servers, with the internet firm offering to publicise your site via a variety of search engines for free. You can also upload and maintain your own web pages via your existing internet service provider (ISP), usually for free, although usually with a less than obvious address. Another company, Free Parking, (www. freeparking.co.uk) will register, park and manage your pages for free, although you'll also have to allow the service's adverts on your pages. Creating and editing your site is also surprisingly easy, as Microsoft's Internet Explorer (www.microsoft.com), the free Internet browser and email package that most internet kits come with, includes a page editing and upload package called Front Page Express. Front Page Express, like Internet Explorer, is free to download and use from the Microsoft site. You can also use it to interact with your internet company's servers. All you pay is the usual cost of accessing the internet, which for most users amounts to a local phone call.",

      "body": "<p>Forget about Al Gore and George W Bush's little sideshow for a minute. Two weeks before US voters decide which one of them gets to occupy the White House, an election takes place here to decide who will succeed a British public figure whom some despairing Americans might like to see parachuted into their presidential contest. It might make it livelier and a bit more dignified at the same time.</p> <p>Sorry guys, but Betty Boothroyd, 151st speaker of the House of Commons and the first woman to occupy the chair, is definitely retiring. \"Call me madam,\" she declared when stuffy clerks tried to call her Mr speaker back in 1992. She's been in politics since the South-East Leicester byelection (she lost) in 1957. \"Time's up,\" as madam speaker likes to tell her customers. A peerage beckons. Baroness West Bromwich perhaps?</p> <p>The question now is, who will win her vacant office? And how much of a shambles will result from her well-intentioned decision to step down on the day that MPs get back from a three-month break? A decision that will make serious discussion of rival claimants difficult, if not impossible?</p> <p>Typical of Westminster, the procedures are far older than those devised to elect the US president in 1787, and even more arcane. The election of a new Pope by the College of Cardinals has about as much openness. The lucky winner is supposed to be dragged reluctantly to the chair, a relic of the several centuries when the speakership - caught between an angry Commons and an autocratic, tax-hungry monarch - was a high-risk occupation.</p> <p>Not that you'd know this time around. Some have been brazen enough to declare outright that they'd like to be speaker, which is not the done thing at all. The traditionally-minded have mumbled to their chums that they \"could be persuaded\".'</p> <p>At least 10 MPs have bravely ignored the ancient threat of imprisonment, murder or mere execution, to signal an interest in the \u00a3114,000 a year job and splendid tied cottage, high above the Thames, with its built-in alarm clock, Big Ben.</p> <p>Augustus Pugin's gothic high-ceilinged rooms in Speaker's House - used for entertaining the endless parade of guests - are magnificent and boast an added attraction, a more-than-full-size portrait of oneself in one's robes. On the floor above them is a chintzy, Knightsbridge-ish flat with two double bedrooms, where any of us might feel comfy enough to kick off our shoes and watch EastEnders after a hard day's speakering.</p> <p>It is a lonely office in many ways, but the view is grand and the travel-to-work time nil. For the right kind of tough cookie it is a wonderful job which - in an era of global TV - makes a modern speaker truly famous. But you have to be the right kind of cookie to take the chair.</p> <p>Does it matter? You may not care for politicians and the appalling racket and/or mess they make. But, just as we all want the MCC to be better managed and the FA Cup Final to be refereed with fairness and flair (whether or not we care about the result), we also need a decent speaker to keep our elected masters in order. Speaker Boothroyd's anger at this government's disdain for parliament was forcefully expressed.</p> <p>\"I don't care if it's Labour or Tory,\" says one off-message minister with claims to have been a brilliant backbench trouble-maker in his time. He says he wants a 'House of Commons person. By that he means an MP who knows and loves the place. Not an ambitious would-be minister, but a backbencher who knows every campaigning trick in the book and believes in parliamentary accountability, not in the sort of over-mighty executive power that would appeal to Charles I and (on a bad day) Tony Blair.</p> <p>A tall order in a period of parliamentary decline and telephone-number majorities. This minister's criterion immediately rules out several of the wannabes.</p> <p>The favourite is a dark horse. Michael \"Mick\" Martin left school in Glasgow at 15, became an engineering apprentice in a railway workshop, then a trade union organiser. An MP since 1979. Decent, kindly and sensitive, quietly cultured and easily under-estimated (a valuable talent) he has had his eye on the job, friends say, for years.</p> <p>Martin has certainly lobbied and organised strongly among key groups: his fellow-Scots and young women Labour MPs. They feel (rightly) that Boothroyd has been unsympathetic to their concerns for a more feminised Commons and the campaign for \"family-friendly\" hours.</p> <p>Overlapping with them are male modernisers who want a faster pace of procedural reform. Despite doubts about his credentials (\"Is Mick really a moderniser?\" some MPs ask or \"Can he manage it?\"), Martin has successfully courted them too. So much smart money went his way last week that William Hill closed the book on him, a shrewd psychological coup for the Martin camp.</p> <p>But it's not over yet. The tearooms, bars and phone lines of Westminster have been awash with gossip ever since Betty - as with Ken Livingstone, even her enemies refer to her using her first name - unexpectedly announced her decision to stand down on July 12. She will stay on until MPs come back from the long summer recess and elect her successor on day one, October 23.</p> <p>Everyone says that, good parliamentarian and champion of the ordinary backbencher that she is, Betty did right to stand down after her eight-year stint and let an experienced house pick the next speaker rather than leave it to the new bugs who will be elected whenever Tony Blair decides to call the general election ...</p> <p>... Well, actually they don't. Amid not-so-private unhappiness in the corridors there is growing evidence that the whole affair may prove a mess. Why? Partly because none of the wannabes is yet able to command the kind of consensual majority which propelled Boothroyd into the chair in 1992. And partly because some Labour MPs no longer expect to be re-elected and are more concerned with finding a job. Worst of all, the voting procedures allow even a sophisticated electorate (MPs pause here for ironic grin) of 659 plenty of scope to pick the wrong person by accident.</p> <p>Under the rules, restated in a letter to all colleagues last week from the father of the house, 84-year-old Sir Edward Heath, someone gets proposed and seconded.</p> <p>So far so good. It's then debated. In the old days, when the fix went in over brandy and cigars in the smoking room or the Carlton Club, that would have been it. No vote and a new speaker elected by acclamation.</p> <p>That is what happened as recently as 1983 when the establishment candidate, Humphrey Atkins (fresh from Mrs T's cabinet), withdrew and nominated Jack Weatherill, the man most MPs wanted. When Boothroyd was nominated as an amendment to the official motion to give the speakership to another cabinet retread, Peter Brooke, she made double history, a woman and - hallelujah! - an open vote, the first in 600 years.</p> <p>If her majority of 372 to 238 had not been persuasive enough to make two other wannabes withdraw, a series of names could have been amended, one at a time, to the motion. This time many MPs, mostly Labour, want proper nominations, hustings even, and a more conventional ballot to reduce the risk of miscalculation.</p> <p>That would mean bringing the house back a few days early so that the procedure committee could be told to amend Standing Order No 1 or that Boothroyd stay on a few days to achieve the same result. It is all in Ted Heath's hands, old but hugely experienced. He is said to be uneasy and open to persuasion.</p> <p>The Guardian's research throws up two further points. There is no mood on either side to respect the \"convention\" (only 30 years old) that the speakership alternates between Tory and Labour. With Labour's 418-162 seat dominance, William Hague seems to accept the logic of numbers.</p> <p>If he had a star candidate things might be different. Likewise the Lib Dems, but few Tory or Labour MPs want to vote for Ming Campbell or Alan Beith. Many have a deep fear of being landed with a weak speaker which will benefit no one in the long run. That points to the fearless Gwyneth Dunwoody, Labour MP for Crewe, and a cantankerous thorn in the side of successive governments, who would only stay one term (always a plus in politics). Or to Martin, the bookies' choice. Unless an even darker horse is biding his time. Or hers.</p> <p><b>Is there a speaker in the house?</b></p> <p>Runners and riders for the big chair:</p> <p>Sir Alan Haselhurst <br>Aged 63, Tory MP for Saffron Walden in Stansted airport country since 1977 (Middleton and Prestwich 1970-74). Soft-spoken, Oxford-educated, pro-European, anti-apartheid, super-moderate and company director. Overlooked in the Thatcher era, he is currently Betty Boothroyd's deputy. Liked by many MPs, even those who wonder if he has the character to impose himself on an unruly Commons; thought aloof by newer Labour MPs. Backed Ken Clarke for Tory leader. Keen on cricket. <br><b> Chances:</b> The bridesmaid, not the bride.</p> <p><b>Sir George Young</b><br> Aged 59, MP for Ealing Acton from 1974 until he did the \"chicken run\" to NW Hants in 1997. Old Etonian Tory moderate and economist, sacked and (much rarer) later reinstated by Thatcher, he ended up in cabinet as the transport secretary who implemented John Major's controversial rail privatisation. A descendant of one of Nelson's admirals at Trafalgar, he demolished the rickety family seat at Cookham when he inherited it at 22. Very tall (6ft 5in) he was known as \"the bicycling baronet\" until officials insisted he could not safely cycle with ministerial red boxes. Likeable but aloof. <br><b> Chances:</b> A possible compromise, but unlikely.</p> <p><b> Michael \"Mick\" Martin</b><br> Aged 55, Labour MP for Glasgow Springburn since 1979. Engineer and trade union organiser, ex-councillor, whose quiet talents for organisation suddenly made him the bookies' favourite. He is currently first deputy chairman of ways and means - number three to the speaker. A Highland piper and teetotaller, his support goes well beyond the tribal block vote from Scotland, despite doubts about his grip. Has courted the \"tearoom vote\" and the modernising New Labour women. A Catholic, which raises interesting (and outdated) constitutional questions. Also a Scot, which raises more topical ones, post-devolution.<br> <b> Chances:</b> Frontrunner, never a comfy spot.</p> <p><b> Menzies \"Ming\" Campbell</b> <br>Aged 59, Liberal Democrat MP for NE Fife (including the Royal and Ancient at St Andrews) since 1987. A smart Scottish lawyer, friend of the late John Smith and former Olympic sprinter (\"The fastest white man on earth,\" quipped his wife), he preferred to remain foreign affairs/defence spokesman rather than risk defeat in the post-Ashdown leadership contest. A natural liberal and moderate, he faces stiff competition even for Lib Dem votes from his colleague, Alan Beith. Too Establishment? Labour MPs say: \"We won't back Ming.\" <br><b> Chances:</b> Slender.</p> <p><b> Gwyneth Dunwoody</b><br>Aged 69, Labour MP for Crewe since 1974, Exeter 1966-70. Convent-educated ex- actress and journalist, ex-junior minister (very briefly, 1967-70), ex-MEP, daughter of the late Morgan Phillips, legendary Labour general secretary, from whom she gets her toughness. Currently Prescott-bashing chair of the Commons transport select committee, she is the maverick candidate with cross-party support, including Tory MPs who want a speaker who will stand up to Tony Blair. Fearless and outspoken, a old-fashioned Labour radical on the right of the party, she has been on the losing side of many Labour battles. Lots of friends - and enemies.<br> <b> Chances:</b> Worth a flutter.</p> <p><b> The Perfect Candidate</b> <br>Aged 62, Labour MP for Backbencher Central since 1978 so he/she still remembers past Labour governments. Ideally an ex-frontbench spokesman under Neil Kinnock and John Smith, dropped by Tony Blair and never made a minister. Instead became a hard-working constituency member, bravely fighting for good causes by using what \"Awkward Squad\" MPs call the tools of a good campaign debates, questions, points of order, motions. Gregarious, but not vain. Indifferent to Establishment bullying or flattery. Patient but fair, handsome and witty. Telegenic with a resonant voice. In short, a paragon ...</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>Mother Nature: Natural Selection and the Female of the Species by Sarah Blaffer Hrdy </strong><br> Chatto, 697 pp., \u00a320, 4 November 1999, 0 701 16625 8 <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501024311,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Sarah Hrdy is tough-minded about a tender subject. Motherhood, she says, is a minefield. Mothers love babies passionately - but not unconditionally. We have evolved as adept sociobiologists, able to calculate love. On the other side of the relationship, baby love is unconditional, indeed desperate. Babies want it all, every scrap of attention they can command, at least up to the point where the mother would be so exhausted that her failure would rebound on the baby itself. Babies cannot be physical tyrants, at their body size, so they resort to psychological tyranny: they are irresistible.</p> <p>In the 700 funny, erudite and combative pages of Mother Nature Hrdy ranges from wet nursing to attachment theory to why a female executive punches through the glass ceiling. Where her biological arguments in general are concerned, I'll assume, to leap to the bottom line, that the nature/nurture debate has moved by this time from the theoretical sphere to the technological - soon, the feuding over sociobiology is going to seem pretty trivial. As for Hrdy's political agenda, her robust analysis goes far towards bridging the gulf between biologists and liberal humanists. It turns out that sociobiology has now joined up with feminism to argue for community spirit and co-operative child care. Childcare enabled human mothers to become human.</p> <p>Mothers' and babies' calculations of love reflect the law proposed by the late William Hamilton, a creative genius of sociobiology. (Hamilton died this year of malaria contracted in the Congo, where he was pursuing his latest ideas on the transmission of disease between species - arguably a martyr to his own passion for truth.) Hamilton reasoned that, by genetic logic, kin should help kin when the benefit outweighs the cost, but help is discounted by distance of relationship. A child shares only half her mother's genes; the other half of the genetic equation comes from the father. The baby is, of course, wholly itself. Hence the potential conflict: the baby wants everything, even if the mother's interests are different.</p> <p>But why should a mother hold back, even a little, from anything as wonderful as her child? If evolution is all about the reproduction of genes, surely the child is her hope of a genetic future? Well, not just this child. She needs to spread her devotion over her whole family, to the toddler(s) already born, and also take into account her chances of having another baby after this one. That means saving enough of herself from the needy newborn, so that she can care for the siblings when they have their noses put out of joint by the new arrival.</p> <p>It means, above all, taking care of herself. Hrdy points out that in human societies as far apart as the Kung San hunter gatherers of the Kalahari Desert, and the inhabitants of California's Sacramento Valley, around 40 per cent of women leave no surviving descendants at their death. Our pre-human foremothers probably had an even lower rate of reproductive success. Perhaps only half the females, in an average generation, left grandchildren. Those who became our ancestresses in each generation were lucky, and strong, and able unconsciously to balance their children's welfare against their own. A mother who squandered the resources needed to maintain her own health would be quickly weeded out - and her family would probably follow her into oblivion.</p> <p>On top of physical health, it helped a whole lot to be dominant. Relations with males are a crucial part of the story. In the vast majority of primate species, males routinely dominate females. In a few, like our near relations the bonobos, or distant ones like ringtailed lemurs, females are clearly the dominant sex. In some more monogamous species, the sexes are co-dominant. (You must judge for yourselves where humans fall along this continuum.)</p> <p>What males seek (genetically speaking) revolves around sex - either access to several (or many) females, or control of at least one female's reproduction to ensure paternity within their own family and a good prospect of siring the next child. (On the kinder side, certainty of paternity often goes with devotion to the child.) Hrdy begins her book by pointing out that males' attempts to control female reproduction began in pre-human times and show no sign of abating. In a passage that has mysteriously disappeared from the British edition, she tells how the US senator Rick Santorum became near-apoplectic (literally) on the Senate floor while talking about his refusal to let his wife have a late-stage abortion when her life was in danger. (Mrs Santorum survived, although the infant was stillborn.) Congresswoman Patricia Schroeder observed: 'It's very interesting the issues they select. They don't want to intervene in the bodily functions of men.'</p> <p>Primate females don't just deal with males, they compete with each other directly over food. Dominant females leave more surviving young on average than subordinate ones. Women, Hrdy argues, still have every incentive to be ambitious - ambition to gain social status is in their genes. This does not mean that every woman is ambitious all the time. No lineage has ever been perpetually dominant, or not for long enough to breed a line of blue-blooded snobs with secure places at the top of the female hierarchy. What has been bred in is the ability to work the social system - knowing how to deal with life as a subordinate, and when ambition will pay off in making a bid for social power. Nowadays, ambition flowers in many spheres: riches or a seat in parliament, painting pictures or improving society. However, in the not-so-distant past, a sense of personal worth was a sine qua non of successful motherhood.</p> <p>What about limiting family size? Mammalian females go for quality offspring, more than quantity. If you simply count genes, the bottom line is having great-grandchildren, not how big your immediate family is. Two children who do well enough to raise offspring of their own are a better bet than many children, all of them at risk. The odds have changed, of course, in modern society, but the body's calculations of how many children it can afford to bear run beneath the calculations of the conscious mind. It often means concentrating all your efforts as a mother on just a few. Whether the limit is imposed by delayed oestrus, sexual abstinence, birth control, spontaneous or induced abortion, or at an extreme, abandoning a baby when there is no hope of raising it, mothers make such choices. We were doing so long before we were human.</p> <p>So far, all of this applies to most social mammals, including the great apes. Here is one way that humans differ from all other apes, however: we are co-operative breeders. This does not mean group sex, it means that we share childcare. A chimpanzee mother carries her baby and gives it milk for about four years before she comes into oestrus again and bears another. By that time, her older child is feeding itself and runs behind her. An orangutan mother has an eight-year birth interval. Before she has another fuzzy orange-haired moppet, the older sibling can independently rock tall rainforest trees to and fro to make a bridge for itself across the jungle canopy. As Jeanne Altmann pointed out twenty years ago, 'baboon mothers, like most primate mothers, including humans, are dual-career mothers.' Still, baboons raise only baboons. Other primates do not try simultaneously to nurse the baby, corral the toddler, help the schoolchild with her homework, and be the breadwinner for the whole family.</p> <p>When the early feminist Charlotte Perkins Gilman looked at primate motherhood she came to the opposite conclusion from Hrdy. (Gilman is best known for her short story, 'The Yellow Wallpaper', about a woman sliding into madness when she is forbidden the chance to write.) In her Women and Economics (1898) Gilman argued that monkey mothers make their own living while carrying a child at the breast. Why, she asked, are women denied that freedom? Hrdy answers that our life history denies it; our children are just too dependent.</p> <p>A human baby is like an embryo ape. It needs almost a year to achieve the motor control of a newborn chimpanzee. The constraint is our brain. For this to squeeze at birth through a bipedal pelvis, it must be only a quarter of its eventual size. Unlike almost every other mammal, most human brain growth comes after birth, not before. (Kangaroos don't count.) A neonate with its quarter-grown brain cannot feed or cling or even manage its own temperature control. Most of its repertoire, instead, is self-advertisement. </p> <p>That is where, according to Hrdy, infant fat comes in. The baby is saying, not just 'love me' but 'keep me.' Unlike any other primate, it is born with a dimpled roundness which proclaims: 'I am a healthy baby, a big, bonny baby - invest in me and I will grow even bigger and healthier.' A fine pair of lungs, which produce not a mewling wail but the roar that shakes the shopping mall, actually reassures the mother that this child is the one she always wanted. (There is no other theory around to explain why our babies are so plump, except the 'aquatic ape' hypothesis championed by Sir Alister Hardy, and, recently, by Elaine Morgan and Simon Bearder. So far, they are a minority of three among physical anthropologists - but I confess it's a lovely idea that we could have spent a million years on a tropical beach, shedding our fur and tossing our babies into the water to watch them swim.)</p> <p>Babyhood once over, children and adolescents depend on parental feeding right into their late teens, even in hunter-gatherer societies. Orangutans may stretch to an eight-year birth interval, but if humans waited till the older child was nutritionally independent, we would need a 15-year interval. There had to be a whole new factor in human upbringing, if the species was to survive at all. The new factor was outside help: help from wherever a mother could find it. From the father, of course, if he is willing - many are indeed supportive and loving. (Hrdy points out, however, that separated fathers in the US are more likely to default on child support than on car payments.) From older siblings - girls in many cultures start baby-minding at six or eight. If possible, from grandmothers. The anthropologist Kristen Hawkes has shown a marked difference in both nutrition and survival among Hadza hunter-gatherer children, depending on whether there is a living grandmother who digs up roots in the dry season. </p> <p>Hrdy adds that 'we tend not to think of post-menopausal women as having a function' and that our 'modern stereotype of grandmothers is more nearly a smiling white-haired old lady bearing Christmas presents than a wiry forager lugging large tubers critical for warding off starvation.' According to Hawkes's theory the menopause doesn't require any special explanation: great apes may cease breeding altogether at about the age of forty, much like ourselves. What does need explaining, however, is how long we live after menopause; nobody else hangs on for twenty years after stopping reproduction. It looks as though women's old age has been under positive selection. </p> <p>One plus is living long enough to raise your own last child, another comes when you help your daughter - or your daughter-in-law and nieces - with support and childcare and a few dry-season tubers. Unlike the girl child-minder who wants to grow her own body and play her own games, a grandmother gives up little, and gains much, by doting on her grandchildren. In short, as Hrdy says, to raise a human with a human brain takes more than a mother. Other primate mothers may be superb single parents, but we grew out of single parenthood as a preferred strategy around two million years ago.</p> <p>Do you like this kind of sociobiological story? Or do you cringe? Perhaps you accept it until you turn to the dark side. In Paris in 1780, of 21,000 registered births, only 5 per cent were nursed by their mothers. Most of the rest were sent to the countryside to be wet-nursed by still poorer women. Mortality among babies was so high that wet-nurses were called 'angelmakers'. Many men inveighed against the practice. In fact, the chosen name of our class of animals - Mammalia - originates in Linnaeus's campaign for women to nurse their children at their own breasts, at a time when most of his own circle did not do so. Worse, in foundling homes of the past, up to 90 per cent of abandoned children died. The fact that women repeatedly give up their babies to others, often with scant hope for their survival, has led some social historians to question whether mother love itself may be a social construct with no innate basis. Hrdy argues, instead, that maternal instinct is not absolute, but contingent.</p> <p>Let me go back to basics. Many humanists never sort out the different meanings of the term 'causation', which biologists routinely (should) learn when they start to study evolution. One of the founders of ethology, the gentle and visionary Jan Tinbergen, wrote that every action has four separate kinds of cause. There is the proximal cause: in this case, the mother's poverty, her depression, her fear of society's disapproval, and the triggering wail in the middle of the night when she is at the end of her tether. There is the developmental cause: the mother is young, and was abused and brought up herself with no model of caring motherhood. There is the phylogenetic cause: she is a human, not a monkey - a monkey mother in most circumstances tries to raise her baby; abandonment of a primate child which is healthy enough to cling onto fur is far less common than among humans, whose babies need so much more physical and social support. Finally, there is the evolutionary function: humans and pre-humans who made the difficult choice to abandon a child when it was really not viable, were more, not less, likely to raise surviving offspring in the end. If contingent motherhood is in our genes, that is because it worked for our foremothers.</p> <p>A second fallacy among humanists is to think that 'innate' means 'universal', or simply 'stereotyped'. Sex itself evolved for the evolutionary benefit of mixing up genes, and producing children different from ourselves. From many points of view, it would be genetically advantageous to just bud off a nice, safe clone, with the genes that we know worked well for ourselves. Instead, we reproduce by sharing half our genes with another person. Every time we have potentially reproductive sex we rejoice in genetic diversity - though humans (and our kin, the bonobos) have extended non-reproductive sex to many other contexts.</p> <p>Any particular genetic predisposition requires particular external circumstances to bring it to fruition. Mother-love itself reflects external circumstances. In the old days, a severely premature or crippled baby simply could not be raised. Now, it can, to become a person with much to contribute to family and society. In other historic eras, a bastard child might have blighted its mother's life as well as its own. Now, in much of the Western world, the concept of bastardy is merely quaint - unless it means the mother has no other hope of support. But the fact of contingency is still there. We see it not only in the occasional horror story of a small corpse left in a dumpster, but in every plump, beloved little baby advertising to the world around: 'I am a keeper.'</p> <p>The wars over sociobiology have been going on now for a quarter of a century. In her splendid book, Defenders of the Truth (Oxford, \u00a320), Ullica Segerstr\u00e5le compares them to grand opera, with sociobiologists and their opponents singing at full voice from separate balconies, while choruses of their supporters fling up coins of moral capital from below. She ends up, though, blaming the opponents of sociobiology for helping to create a monster called 'genetic determinism', and tagging sociobiologists with an all-or-nothing view that nobody holds.</p> <p>This begins to matter away from the artificially lit stage of the opera. How genes influence behaviour is now the preoccupation of earnest biology undergraduates, who cross inbred strains of mice which are more or less likely to rape, or more or less likely to mother. They trace the relevant genes to their respective points on a chromosome. Eventually, the genes themselves, and their protein products, are unveiled one by one. Cracking the code is no longer the province of the brilliant innovator. A legion of cipher clerks, manual in hand, are reading the secrets of human nature (or at least of inbred mice).</p> <p>We need to come to terms with this. Crude genetic determinism is (or should be) dead, but genetic influences on behaviour will become common knowledge, and anyone with an interest in ethics, or politics, or social welfare must face that fact. Our conception of ourselves will embrace not only our personal genetic quirks, but the broad sweep of our evolutionary past.</p> <p>This is where a book like Hrdy's comes into its own. Much of what it concludes is common sense, even if it's told here with panache. Any woman who - like Hrdy herself, like me - has juggled children and career will know how we compromised. Hrdy gave up her fieldwork on the sacred monkeys, the hanuman langurs of India, to raise her children. I gave up my Madagascar lemurs for ten years, and went back only when my husband said, 'Come on, it's Women's Year, I'll take six months to mind the kids.' We both had the luxury of writing books from home, which turned out to be a smart career choice. Charlotte Perkins Gilman horrified her contemporaries by making the opposite decision. She left her adored daughter behind with her husband and his new wife, reasoning that a stable home would be better for the child than her own life as itinerant author and lecturer. We had choices. A large number of mothers, however, have no choice but to work outside the home, or the family doesn't eat. That means finding childcare. Arguing the evolutionary background doesn't change brute facts.</p> <p>What it does do, however, is give us ammunition. The view that a mother should simply stay at home breeding, whether or not that suits her needs, has long since been consigned to a dustbin called 'Victoriana'. The more recent view that a woman with children must become a superwoman who does it all, all at once, all by herself, male-style career alongside responsibility for the family, can now be tossed in a dustbin labelled 'non-human primate'. Childcare by fathers, friends, grandmothers and the community at large, is an integral part of growing up human - the freeing of human mothers to love our babies while still being ourselves.</p> <p>\u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/\">LRB</a>.

      "bodyText": "Mother Nature: Natural Selection and the Female of the Species by Sarah Blaffer Hrdy Chatto, 697 pp., \u00a320, 4 November 1999, 0 701 16625 8 Buy it at BOL Sarah Hrdy is tough-minded about a tender subject. Motherhood, she says, is a minefield. Mothers love babies passionately - but not unconditionally. We have evolved as adept sociobiologists, able to calculate love. On the other side of the relationship, baby love is unconditional, indeed desperate. Babies want it all, every scrap of attention they can command, at least up to the point where the mother would be so exhausted that her failure would rebound on the baby itself. Babies cannot be physical tyrants, at their body size, so they resort to psychological tyranny: they are irresistible. In the 700 funny, erudite and combative pages of Mother Nature Hrdy ranges from wet nursing to attachment theory to why a female executive punches through the glass ceiling. Where her biological arguments in general are concerned, I'll assume, to leap to the bottom line, that the nature/nurture debate has moved by this time from the theoretical sphere to the technological - soon, the feuding over sociobiology is going to seem pretty trivial. As for Hrdy's political agenda, her robust analysis goes far towards bridging the gulf between biologists and liberal humanists. It turns out that sociobiology has now joined up with feminism to argue for community spirit and co-operative child care. Childcare enabled human mothers to become human. Mothers' and babies' calculations of love reflect the law proposed by the late William Hamilton, a creative genius of sociobiology. (Hamilton died this year of malaria contracted in the Congo, where he was pursuing his latest ideas on the transmission of disease between species - arguably a martyr to his own passion for truth.) Hamilton reasoned that, by genetic logic, kin should help kin when the benefit outweighs the cost, but help is discounted by distance of relationship. A child shares only half her mother's genes; the other half of the genetic equation comes from the father. The baby is, of course, wholly itself. Hence the potential conflict: the baby wants everything, even if the mother's interests are different. But why should a mother hold back, even a little, from anything as wonderful as her child? If evolution is all about the reproduction of genes, surely the child is her hope of a genetic future? Well, not just this child. She needs to spread her devotion over her whole family, to the toddler(s) already born, and also take into account her chances of having another baby after this one. That means saving enough of herself from the needy newborn, so that she can care for the siblings when they have their noses put out of joint by the new arrival. It means, above all, taking care of herself. Hrdy points out that in human societies as far apart as the Kung San hunter gatherers of the Kalahari Desert, and the inhabitants of California's Sacramento Valley, around 40 per cent of women leave no surviving descendants at their death. Our pre-human foremothers probably had an even lower rate of reproductive success. Perhaps only half the females, in an average generation, left grandchildren. Those who became our ancestresses in each generation were lucky, and strong, and able unconsciously to balance their children's welfare against their own. A mother who squandered the resources needed to maintain her own health would be quickly weeded out - and her family would probably follow her into oblivion. On top of physical health, it helped a whole lot to be dominant. Relations with males are a crucial part of the story. In the vast majority of primate species, males routinely dominate females. In a few, like our near relations the bonobos, or distant ones like ringtailed lemurs, females are clearly the dominant sex. In some more monogamous species, the sexes are co-dominant. (You must judge for yourselves where humans fall along this continuum.) What males seek (genetically speaking) revolves around sex - either access to several (or many) females, or control of at least one female's reproduction to ensure paternity within their own family and a good prospect of siring the next child. (On the kinder side, certainty of paternity often goes with devotion to the child.) Hrdy begins her book by pointing out that males' attempts to control female reproduction began in pre-human times and show no sign of abating. In a passage that has mysteriously disappeared from the British edition, she tells how the US senator Rick Santorum became near-apoplectic (literally) on the Senate floor while talking about his refusal to let his wife have a late-stage abortion when her life was in danger. (Mrs Santorum survived, although the infant was stillborn.) Congresswoman Patricia Schroeder observed: 'It's very interesting the issues they select. They don't want to intervene in the bodily functions of men.' Primate females don't just deal with males, they compete with each other directly over food. Dominant females leave more surviving young on average than subordinate ones. Women, Hrdy argues, still have every incentive to be ambitious - ambition to gain social status is in their genes. This does not mean that every woman is ambitious all the time. No lineage has ever been perpetually dominant, or not for long enough to breed a line of blue-blooded snobs with secure places at the top of the female hierarchy. What has been bred in is the ability to work the social system - knowing how to deal with life as a subordinate, and when ambition will pay off in making a bid for social power. Nowadays, ambition flowers in many spheres: riches or a seat in parliament, painting pictures or improving society. However, in the not-so-distant past, a sense of personal worth was a sine qua non of successful motherhood. What about limiting family size? Mammalian females go for quality offspring, more than quantity. If you simply count genes, the bottom line is having great-grandchildren, not how big your immediate family is.

Today's report by the public watchdog, the national audit office, is the first serious study of the ineffectiveness of the SSRA, Labour's son of British Rail, which has been struggling for life since Tony Blair was elected. The SSRA, which should finally be given teeth in the government's transport legislation this autumn, is not the body it has been cracked up to be. It is supposed to be the highly active offspring of an unwanted creature of the last government, the rail franchise regulator. This was the unfortunate body given the difficult task of shelling out franchises as quickly as possible to anybody who asked, without bothering to ensure that passengers were properly protected. The best example of that occurred three years ago when South West Trains got rid of 70 drivers, only to find that it had to cancel hundreds of trains. Where was the franchise director? Wringing his hands on the sidelines, saying: \"Oh dear!'' The SSRA says that it will be tougher and more demanding, but there are few signs yet that it is happy with its new mandate, and the NAO report quite rightly suggests new methods to make it more passenger-friendly. The SSRA's problem is its deafening silence on strategy. It has been an entity for almost 18 months, but there is no sign of a strategy for an industry which is experiencing the biggest boom since the end of the second world war. The NAO report does not mention this, but the SSRA has approached the task back to front. Instead of producing a much-needed panacea for the railways by acting as the lead organisation, it has simply asked the rail companies to come forward with new bids.

OPRAF does not have enough powers to penalise or reward firms for the punctuality of their trains. Some firms haven't been set high enough performance targets and have no incentive to do better. Because the train operators fear penalties for cancelled trains more than penalties for late trains, some prefer to run trains very late instead of cancelling them, leading to timetable disruption.</p> <p><b>How big are these penalties, and how have the privatised trains shaped up against British Rail?</b><br> In 1999-2000, the rail companies were penalised to the tune of \u00a325.6m but were given \u00a322.3m in rewards for good performance. The NAO says the number, punctuality and reliability of trains has been slightly better than under BR, with 87% of trains arriving within five minutes of schedule and 1.2% cancelled. But these figures conceal wide variations between different train firms.</p> <p><b>What about overcrowding on the trains?</b><br> The report says OPRAF hasn't had the powers to force companies to make more seats available. There is a set of rules which is supposed to penalise companies which don't put enough carriages on trains at peak times, but the NAO says the penalties probably aren't high enough. And there isn't enough information about where the growth in passenger numbers is happening, and why.</p> <p><b>Why hasn't OPRAF kept an eye on what its franchisees are really up to?</b> <br>That's what the NAO would like to know. Not only did OPRAF fail to work out how to count passengers properly, but it relied on passenger satisfaction surveys and information from the companies to assess what journeys on the privatised railways were actually like - instead of sending inspectors out to look at the state of the carriages and stations and experience the misery of delays and overcrowding for themselves.</p> <p><b>Is this report going to change things?</b> <br>Things are already changing. OPRAF, set up by the Conservatives in 1993, is going to be replaced soon by the Strategic Rail Authority, which has set out its menu of reforms as the Shadow Strategic Rail Authority, the SSRA.

This is a web, not Wap site, which offers a simple, almost idiot-proof, way of doing it - and it is completely free (apart from the usual call charges). You just type in what you want on an ordinary website and the site will do the necessary to make it appear on your phone. All you have to do then is to find some way of telling the rest of the world it is there. </p> <p>Digitaloctopus has had the neat idea of putting Hugh Johnson's pocket book of wine on to Orange phones from this week: obtainable through its What's New menu. It enables discreet diners to check out the quality of the wine while the wine waiter isn't looking, or to browse before buying in a supermarket. There is a search facility as well. Digitaloctopus takes its cut by getting a percentage of the cost of the call - usually 5p a minute. Smart application. </p> <p>Another useful service is www.curryhouse.net/wap which tells you where your nearest curry house is after you type in a place name. Best to get it via the wap portal <a href=\"http://www.waphq.com\">www.waphq.com</a>, which has bags of other things as well. When you get through, go to the Leisure section and hope that you don't get \"connectivity\" problems. </p> <p>Search engines are starting to appear on Wap phones such as web-favourite Google but connectivity was spasmodic on the phone I was using (Nokia/Vodafone). And trying to navigate the main web through the small screen of a phone is like being lost in the jungle with only a magnifying glass. </p> <p>Lots of mainstream web sites are now starting to introduce Wap offspring like www.multimap.com/wap. This is the wap offshoot, of the multimap.com website offering free maps that gets 1.9m unique users every month. Lastminute.com and Amazon.com also have wap sites - but again it is better (alas) at the moment to access them through an established portal because direct access is tricky. </p>",

This is a web, not Wap site, which offers a simple, almost idiot-proof, way of doing it - and it is completely free (apart from the usual call charges). You just type in what you want on an ordinary website and the site will do the necessary to make it appear on your phone. All you have to do then is to find some way of telling the rest of the world it is there. Digitaloctopus has had the neat idea of putting Hugh Johnson's pocket book of wine on to Orange phones from this week: obtainable through its What's New menu. It enables discreet diners to check out the quality of the wine while the wine waiter isn't looking, or to browse before buying in a supermarket. There is a search facility as well. Digitaloctopus takes its cut by getting a percentage of the cost of the call - usually 5p a minute. Smart application. Another useful service is www.curryhouse.net/wap which tells you where your nearest curry house is after you type in a place name. Best to get it via the wap portal www.waphq.com, which has bags of other things as well. When you get through, go to the Leisure section and hope that you don't get \"connectivity\" problems. Search engines are starting to appear on Wap phones such as web-favourite Google but connectivity was spasmodic on the phone I was using (Nokia/Vodafone). And trying to navigate the main web through the small screen of a phone is like being lost in the jungle with only a magnifying glass. Lots of mainstream web sites are now starting to introduce Wap offspring like www.multimap.com/wap. This is the wap offshoot, of the multimap.com website offering free maps that gets 1.9m unique users every month. Lastminute.com and Amazon.com also have wap sites - but again it is better (alas) at the moment to access them through an established portal because direct access is tricky.",

      "body": "<p>As Gordon Brown contemplates his final hours as a single man this morning at his constituency home overlooking the Firth of Forth, he might allow himself a moment to enjoy a sweet irony.</p> <p>Despite regular speculation in newspaper diary columns and the best efforts of Charlie Whelan, the former spin doctor fond of talking up the prospect of a union between the chancellor and Sarah Macauley, news of the couple's impending nuptials came as a surprise when it was announced a little after 8.30pm yesterday.</p> <p>A fiercely private man uncomfortable with the gossip that has surrounded his relationship, the chancellor will surely take some pleasure in having outwitted colleagues and commentators alike. Mr Whelan last night said the ceremony had been planned with all the secrecy of a budget since Mr Brown proposed in January. But had anyone cared to scan the noticeboard at Inverkeithing registry office during the last fortnight they would have seen the wedding bans.</p> <p>Like any other couple Mr Brown and Ms Macaulay were obliged to publicise details of their plans 15 days before the ceremony. Under Scots law, everyone must inform their local registry office of the time and place of their marriage.</p> <p>Their full names - James Gordon Brown and Sarah Jane Macaulay - appeared on a piece of paper pinned to a front window of the local registry alongside every other couple planning to wed. Mr Brown has reason to be grateful for the discretion of those locals who saw the notice..</p> <p>Mr Brown's decision to marry seven months short of his 50th birthday ends six years of speculation and gos sip about the nature of his relationship with Ms Macauley.</p> <p>The couple met in February 1994 at a fundraising event in Mr Brown's constituency, and took to each other immediately. Mr Brown was already shadow chancellor, developing Labour's economic policy alongside party leader John Smith.</p> <p>Within three months, however, Smith was dead, and as Mr Brown stood aside and let Tony Blair contest the leadership election, Miss Macauley was a source of support and wise counsel.</p> <p>With the couple remaining out of the spotlight and Miss Macauley one half of Hobsbawm Macauley, the most formidable PR agency in London and a major player in Labour's fund-raising machine, there was speculation that the relationship was more a product of spin than true love, intended to boost the batchelor's popularity with the electorate.</p> <p>Mr Brown's occasional and enigmatic comments on the subject did little to dispel such rumours. In 1996, pressed by Sue Lawley on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs about to his sexuality, he replied: \"I'm not married. It just hasn't happened. I hope it does. It may yet. It probably will do. It's one of those things that I'm suprised hasn't happened, but it hasn't.\"</p> <p>As the 1997 general election approached however and the Labour spin machine moved into top gear, Mr Brown's jealously guarded privacy was inevitably comprimised. Charlie Whelan was fond of briefing on the couple's relationship leading to reports of an engagement at the turn of the year. One newspaper even speculated that Ms Macauley had taken advantage of a leap year in 1996 to propose.</p> <p>Despite Mr Brown's retuicence news about the couple did seem to appear at politically expediant moments. In the wake of the election triumph and shortly before Mr Brown's first budget the News of the World photographed the couple as they enjoyed a meal in a cramped Soho restaurant. The picture appeared the work of a papparazzo but was in fact carefully staged by Whelan, who was rumoured to be sitting at an adjoining table.</p> <p>Early in 1998 the couple were pictured together at the wedding of Ed Balls, Brown's special economics advisor, and Yvette Cooper, public health minister shortly before an authorised biography of the chancellor was published. Balls and Cooper will be in attendance today.</p> <p>In March that year, two days before the budget, they appeared together again at a birthday party for the son of Brown's secretary, Sue Nye, and his advisor Gavyn Davies.

      "bodyText": "As Gordon Brown contemplates his final hours as a single man this morning at his constituency home overlooking the Firth of Forth, he might allow himself a moment to enjoy a sweet irony. Despite regular speculation in newspaper diary columns and the best efforts of Charlie Whelan, the former spin doctor fond of talking up the prospect of a union between the chancellor and Sarah Macauley, news of the couple's impending nuptials came as a surprise when it was announced a little after 8.30pm yesterday. A fiercely private man uncomfortable with the gossip that has surrounded his relationship, the chancellor will surely take some pleasure in having outwitted colleagues and commentators alike. Mr Whelan last night said the ceremony had been planned with all the secrecy of a budget since Mr Brown proposed in January. But had anyone cared to scan the noticeboard at Inverkeithing registry office during the last fortnight they would have seen the wedding bans. Like any other couple Mr Brown and Ms Macaulay were obliged to publicise details of their plans 15 days before the ceremony. Under Scots law, everyone must inform their local registry office of the time and place of their marriage. Their full names - James Gordon Brown and Sarah Jane Macaulay - appeared on a piece of paper pinned to a front window of the local registry alongside every other couple planning to wed. Mr Brown has reason to be grateful for the discretion of those locals who saw the notice.. Mr Brown's decision to marry seven months short of his 50th birthday ends six years of speculation and gos sip about the nature of his relationship with Ms Macauley. The couple met in February 1994 at a fundraising event in Mr Brown's constituency, and took to each other immediately. Mr Brown was already shadow chancellor, developing Labour's economic policy alongside party leader John Smith. Within three months, however, Smith was dead, and as Mr Brown stood aside and let Tony Blair contest the leadership election, Miss Macauley was a source of support and wise counsel. With the couple remaining out of the spotlight and Miss Macauley one half of Hobsbawm Macauley, the most formidable PR agency in London and a major player in Labour's fund-raising machine, there was speculation that the relationship was more a product of spin than true love, intended to boost the batchelor's popularity with the electorate. Mr Brown's occasional and enigmatic comments on the subject did little to dispel such rumours. In 1996, pressed by Sue Lawley on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs about to his sexuality, he replied: \"I'm not married. It just hasn't happened. I hope it does. It may yet. It probably will do. It's one of those things that I'm suprised hasn't happened, but it hasn't.\" As the 1997 general election approached however and the Labour spin machine moved into top gear, Mr Brown's jealously guarded privacy was inevitably comprimised. Charlie Whelan was fond of briefing on the couple's relationship leading to reports of an engagement at the turn of the year. One newspaper even speculated that Ms Macauley had taken advantage of a leap year in 1996 to propose. Despite Mr Brown's retuicence news about the couple did seem to appear at politically expediant moments. In the wake of the election triumph and shortly before Mr Brown's first budget the News of the World photographed the couple as they enjoyed a meal in a cramped Soho restaurant. The picture appeared the work of a papparazzo but was in fact carefully staged by Whelan, who was rumoured to be sitting at an adjoining table. Early in 1998 the couple were pictured together at the wedding of Ed Balls, Brown's special economics advisor, and Yvette Cooper, public health minister shortly before an authorised biography of the chancellor was published. Balls and Cooper will be in attendance today. In March that year, two days before the budget, they appeared together again at a birthday party for the son of Brown's secretary, Sue Nye, and his advisor Gavyn Davies. In the autumn as the party conference approached with stories about Robin Cook and his second wife Gaynor dominating the papers, there were further stories that a date had been set for a wedding the following summer. At Westminster Mr Brown's decision will inevitably be seen as a key political, as well as personal, moment. Some will say it completes him as a public figure and reconfirms him as the Labour leader \"heir apparent\". The Labour heartlands, already favourites of Mr Brown, will be beating harder with last night's news. But both friend and foe in the tight world of New Labour will also hope that the wedding will be the melting of the Iron Chancellor, the episode that resolves and relaxes a sometimes driven politician. Few describe him as \"psychologically flawed\" but the marriage announcement, in a still marriage obsessed society, could make him a more popular and rounded figure. The problem in large part that people mistook his shyness for earnestness and his Scottish praise of the work ethic for workerholism. However, many immediate colleagues will hope that marriage produces not just young children to rival Leo but a New Man less prone to intervene in the affairs of most Whitehall departments. The announcement also comes at a time when Brown has decided to assert himself as the saviour of public services, following more than two years of tight control of public expenditure, the public spending review announced last month gave the Chancellor a chance to reveal his true political instincts, just as this marriage may end a period of private doubt. Miss McAulay, who is likely to fit naturally into the role of politician's wife, is not just a skilful operator as a publicist, she also has a dry acerbic sense of humour that will help to give the Chancellor the extra personal dimension he needs in an age in which politicians must not just rely on their policy but also their personality to succeed.",

      "body": "<p>When Robin Downs signed up for <a href=\"http://www.Breathe.com/\" target=\"_new\">Breathe's</a> unmetered internet access deal, Breathe Freely, he thought it would save him a fortune. </p> <p>For a one-off payment of \u00a350, Robin - a systems consultant based in the West Midlands - could surf the net whenever and for as long as he wanted. Breathe Freely's free 24/7 internet service, one of a rash of new unmetered access deals announced in April and May this year, would mean he would have no worries about racking up those giant phone bills every UK-based net user dreads. </p> <p>Or so he thought. Last week, three months after signing up to Breathe's offer, he was unceremoniously disconnected from the service provider's unmetered offering. The reason? He was using it too much. </p> <p>Around 500 other \"heavy users\" found they, too, were no longer breathing freely. </p> <p>Their disappointment was mirrored by thousands of surfers using different ISPs around the country who - while not actually thrown off their services - were suffering woeful levels of service. </p> <p>Breathe, founded by Martin Dawes Telecommunications and backed by \u00a320m from Chase Capital Partners, 3i and US Flatiron Partners, had invoked a clause in its terms and conditions allowing it to disconnect anyone who \"puts our ability to supply the service at risk\". </p> <p>But at least Downs and his fellow \"heavy breathers\" had enjoyed some kind of service - albeit briefly. Rhys Tucker, from Cardiff, is one of many NTL users who were looking forward to similar savings way back in March, when the cable giant promised: \"From 17 April 2000, you'll be able to surf the internet free of charge!\" Tucker is still waiting, along with thousands of other net users, for the vital CD-rom to arrive in the post, so he can get connected. </p> <p>By the end of last week the Advertising Standards Authority had received 144 complaints about <a href=\"http://www.ntl.com\" target=\"_new\">NTL's</a> advertising of the service, and it has launched a formal investigation. NTL, if nothing else, can at least claim the dubious honour of the highest ever number of complaints over matters of fact in an advertisement, notching up nearly double last year's record. </p> <p>Meanwhile, across the country, net users signed up to other unmetered ISPs are struggling with engaged tones, slow service and technical cock-ups. </p> <p>LineOne has announced it is pulling the plug on its unmetered access from the end of September, provoking a frosty letter from its trade association, the Internet Service Providers' Association, asking it to explain its actions. <a href=\"http://www.Virgin.Net\" target=\"_new\"> Virgin.Net</a> abandoned plans to unveil its own flat-rate service last month. Even BT's own ISP, BTInternet, has drawn complaints over its level of service, especially on weekday evenings. </p> <p>The ISPs' long summer of discontent started in a blaze of hype in March. <a href=\"http://www.altavista.com\" target=\"_new\">AltaVista</a> announced it would launch a new form of internet access which would give users free calls to the net. The company did not actually deliver until the very end of June - but that did not stop several other ISPs launching competing offers almost straight away. </p> <p>On the horizon was a deal, brokered by telecoms watchdog Oftel, which would force BT to offer the means to provide unmetered internet access at wholesale prices. With BT dragging its heels, that is only beginning to happen, meaning the ISPs are left paying users' phone bills. Some ISPs feel that is a price they are not willing to pay. </p> <p>At Breathe Freely, however, it appears to have simply been a question of capacity - or lack of it. The company decided it wanted to skim off the most internet-use intensive - and expensive - 1% of its users. </p> <p>\"We got it wrong,\" admits Sean Gardner, chief operating officer of Breathe, trying to explain why Robin Downs and around 500 other users were cut off. \"When we launched Breathe Freely we were among the first unmetered ISPs, and there was no forward visibility as to what the usage patterns would be. </p> <p>\"Looking over the first three months of the service, we found that 1% of the users were causing real problems for the rest. Had it been half of the user base, we would have had problems, but doing this was the right thing for the majority.\" </p> <p>But why could Breathe, with its high-profile financial backing and big-budget advertising campaign, not simply invest in its infrastructure to provide a decent service to all its users? Gardner says the technology which they opted for at launch was, remarkably, not scaleable to meet demand. Breathe Freely will relaunch this month, he says, with more flexible technology in place. </p> <p>Meanwhile, he says, the company has learnt a lot about users' voracious appetites for the internet when they are not paying by the minute for a connection. </p> <p>\"The research company, Durlacher, predicted a three-fold increase in a user's internet use when they got unmetered access. Our experience pointed to an increase of six to 10 times previous usage. We just could not predict that,\" says Gardner. He says one user somehow managed to clock up 29 hours of usage in one day by setting up an ISDN-style connection. </p> <p>\"There were also several businesses using the service,\" he adds, \"and we had made it clear this offer was not for business users.\" </p> <p>But Downs insists that he was not abusing Breathe Freely before he was cut off, using it mainly in the evenings and then largely only for internet chats with friends living abroad. \"They say they have a small proportion of users on for a long time,\" he says. \"But, statistically, that is always going to be the case - you're going to get people who use it a lot, and those who do not use it at all.\" </p> <p>Downs is now challenging the validity of the clause in Breathe's contract that says users can be disconnected if their level of use puts the service at risk. </p> <p>He is also angry he got no warning that his levels of use were considered abnormal. \"At no point have I had problems getting on to Breathe,\" he adds. \"I've not been hearing the engaged tone - it didn't appear line capacity was an issue.\" </p> <p> Over at NTL, consumer public relations manager Jacqueline Aldridge says it, too, has been caught out by demand. It has been limiting the number of CDs issued to preserve the quality of their service (although Online readers who have managed to get CDs have complained about engaged tones, downed email services and sluggish responses from NTLworld). </p> <p>\"There has been very high demand for the service so we have been managing distribution of discs,\" she says. \"Obviously, there are very frustrated and disappointed customers, because they are keen to get the service as soon as possible. </p> <p>\"We're sending out discs now very rapidly to people in the queue, and everyone who signed up before the end of May should get their disc before the end of August. Anyone who signed up after that is being told exactly how long they will have to wait. </p> <p>\"Most people who are using the service are really liking it. Just because it is a free service doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to get connected, or have the service collapse under the weight of people using it. We want to make sure that, for the people who are using it, it's a really high quality experience.\" </p> <p>For would-be NTLworld user Rhys Tucker that isn't the point: he feels the email he was sent in March promised him free internet access in mid-April, and NTL's failure to deliver that has cost him money in charges made to NTL's standard, metered service. He is now pursuing a claim against NTL in Cardiff county court in an attempt to recoup those charges. </p> <p>\"I'm really annoyed by it all,\" he says. \"What really gets me is that they can promise free internet access and then just not honour that commitment. They promised existing customers would have priority, but that doesn't seemed to have happened at all.\" </p> <p>The problems some ISPs are facing with unmetered access are not deterring their rivals - this week ic24 announced plans to extend its free hours online to weekday evenings. The company's marketing director, Jill Playle, has even lambasted other ISPs for deceiving consumers and taken a lie detector test in an attempt to prove her company's \"after eight\" deal is really free. </p> <p>It is, but the company's offering is still restricted, running only for four hours a night during the week, and users get cut off after one hour to discourage loitering. </p> <p>So is unconditional, quality unmetered internet access ever going to come to pass? Telecoms analyst Tim Johnson of Ovum, an IT research house, says that the arrival of a new bulk-buying arrangement with BT (see panel) will make it much easier for ISPs to offer flat-rate access 24 hours a day, by fixing their costs. </p> <p>The new system, he says, has proven technically difficult to implement, and has taken BT and some ISPs by surprise. But, he adds, \"when they do get round to it, it will change the whole scene. </p> <p>\"In 12 months' time,\" he promises, \"fixed rate access will be what everyone is doing, as a matter of course.\" </p> <p><strong>Can we turn this telecoms fiasco into Friaco?</strong></p> <p>So far, unmetered access has been a fiasco. Aside from problems with quality, even signing up to an unmetered ISP has been complicated by demands to switch phone companies, and install special software that forces you to look at advertisements. </p> <p>These problems stem from the struggle ISPs face to recoup their costs from unmetered access. They are effectively having to pay users' phone bills by the minute, while being paid only a flat fee, if anything, by the user. They are unable to buy connections in bulk from BT, whose only flat rate product - Surftime - is dismissed by many as too expensive and too complicated to administer. </p> <p>There is some hope, however. BT has been told by the telecoms regulator, Oftel, that it must offer a new solution for ISPs wanting to offer unmetered access. That solution is called Friaco - for flat rate internet access call origination. Friaco could have a dramatic effect on the way Britain accesses the internet. According to the Campaign for Unmetered Telecommunications (Cut), \"always-on\" Friaco connections could cost ISPs as little as \u00a360 a year per user, which works out at 60 to 80% less than BT Surftime. </p> <p>That is low enough to keep subscriptions low, or even free. </p> <p>Friaco was supposed to be available from June 1, but continued haggling between BT and ISPs means it has been delayed. </p> <p>Negotiations are continuing between ISPs and BT over how the costs will be split, but it is expected that we will begin to see the first Friaco services in the last three months of this year. </p> <p>And that means, finally, we could be surfing on a flat rate in time for Christmas. </p> <p>Cut's Erol Ziya says that, while this summer's problems might create short-term scepticism about unmetered offers, in the long term \"it will take off\". </p> <p>\"It is the only sensible way to use the internet,\" he says. </p> <p>\"Things will settle down, and there will be a range of providers at a range of prices and quality. </p> <p>\"There is a market for pay by the minute, but that will become the niche it always should have been.\"</p>",

The company will re-examine plans to join the market at the end of year. </p> <p>\"We had been looking at the second quarter of this year for a flotation but the market conditions are not right,\" he said. \"We are not experiencing any difficulties raising private financing because we are meeting our performance targets so there is no need to rush.\" </p> <p>Bigsave's stated aim is to reach profitability by 2002. The company has raised $22m (\u00a314.7m) in private investment so far from backers including Equitable Life, Friends Provident and a string of wealthy individuals. </p> <p>Its latest initiative is the launch of a nightly Bigsave-branded show on digital home shopping channel Ideal World. </p> <p>Mr Mellon has been a late convert to the internet but has adopted the faith with some vigour. In March he rebranded his investment vehicle Regent Pacific as iRegent.com, reflecting the weight of money going into internet stocks.

      "bodyText": "Bigsave.com, the online department store owned by Hong Kong-based financier Jim Mellon, has shelved plans for a stock market flotation that was to have valued the business at \u00a3300m. Ian Wilson, Bigsave's chief executive, said the decision had been informed by tough market conditions, which continue to punish hi-tech stocks. The company will re-examine plans to join the market at the end of year. \"We had been looking at the second quarter of this year for a flotation but the market conditions are not right,\" he said. \"We are not experiencing any difficulties raising private financing because we are meeting our performance targets so there is no need to rush.\" Bigsave's stated aim is to reach profitability by 2002. The company has raised $22m (\u00a314.7m) in private investment so far from backers including Equitable Life, Friends Provident and a string of wealthy individuals. Its latest initiative is the launch of a nightly Bigsave-branded show on digital home shopping channel Ideal World. Mr Mellon has been a late convert to the internet but has adopted the faith with some vigour. In March he rebranded his investment vehicle Regent Pacific as iRegent.com, reflecting the weight of money going into internet stocks. One of his most profitable investments has been a 45% stake in Korea Online a profitable web-based insurance company. He owns 60% of Bigsave. The British tax exile, however, is better known in this country for leading the attack that spelt the end for Hambros, the merchant bank. Bigsave claims to have between 40,000 and 50,000 hits a day and offers a wide range of goods from electrical goods, to children's toys, books and CDs. The company's board includes former Kingfisher director Nigel Whittaker. Mr Wilson said the Bigsave TV home shopping programme was illustrative of the way e-tailers would need to develop. \"This is quite clearly a key initiative for us,\" he said. \"It is about doing what the consumer wants and if the consumer would like to buy through the TV then we will provide the service.\"",

He was good with children, animals, orienteering maps and assault courses. He was handsome and clever, gallant and charming, and wise beyond his years. A leader but not authoritarian, an optimist but not a dreamer, diffident but not self-doubting. And even though he was a bit posh, Fogle was the embodiment of the hopeful wholesomeness of the BBC's Castaway experiment. </p> <p>When the BBC screened the process by which they selected the 30-odd members of the public who were to be marooned on the Hebridean island of Taransay, Fogle was the kind of righteous man in whose hands most people would willingly place their future. The other castaways liked him; the public liked him; Cynthia, Castaway's resident psychologist, was full of praise for him; even the Daily Mail liked him. And the camera loved him. Alas, Fogle is now yesterday's man. </p> <p>For today we have Big Brother; gentleman Ben and the other castaways are last-year's loves. The housemates ensconced and under watchful eyes in the specially built complex in east London are our new obsession. Critics may have castigated the show but Big Brother has proved as much of a hit here as in its country of origin, Holland, and the other territories where the format has been picked up. </p> <p>In the US, 22m viewers have been tuning in to CBS to watch the American version; in Germany, an evicted housemate has cut a number one single and now fronts his own Saturday night TV show; and frenzied fans invaded the house in Spain on the show's final day and forced an airlift evacuation of the remaining housemate. However, it is in the Netherlands that the programme has had most impact. Trouncing everything else in the ratings, Big Brother there spawned several \"stars\" including Bart, the winner, who was famously caught on infrared cameras having sex with housemate, Sabine. Bart is now a Dutch national hero. </p> <p>While Channel 4 isn't releasing audience figures, the first show won a higher than normal share of the audience for the station and, as the weeks go by, evictions are proclaimed and the tension mounts as to who will win the \u00a370,000 prize; Big Brother's grip on audiences and the national psyche seems assured. And its popularity proves one thing: we like to see people suffer. Where Castaway appeals to our better nature with its intrinsic optimism, Big Brother does the opposite. The Taransay experiment is designed to show how (and whether) a community can be built. It is about cooperation, problem-solving and conflict resolution. There is something admirable and high-minded about the castaways. While there are inevitably a couple who seek fame through their appearance on the show, taking a year out to live on a Hebridean island with a bunch of strangers, grow - and kill - your own food, while eschewing creature comforts, is a high price to pay for a five-minute appearance on Richard and Judy. Castaway is about creating a utopia for all the participants. They may fight, but their situation isn't a competition; there are no losers. The prize is the experience. </p> <p>Conversely, Big Brother is positively dystopian. As in all good drama, conflict was an essential part of the docusoap genre that preceded \"reality TV\" such as Castaway and Big Brother. Lost musicians, uncatered-for banquets and dogs in jeopardy made docusoaps the ratings successes that they were. But these were conflicts that simply arose, as they do. Castaway and Channel 4's Shipwrecked took ordinary people and put them in extraordinary circumstances. In them, conflicts arose because of the dislocation involved. The attraction of people-marooned-on-an-island programmes is seeing how ordinary people cope in alien environments. </p> <p>Big Brother has taken the genre further by adding another ingredient to the mix. By introducing the prize money, its producers have made betraying one's housemates and erstwhile friends a necessity, not simply a by-product of being in a strange situation. It takes the unique selling point of the American game show Greed, which gives contestants the opportunity to eliminate fellow team members in order to get a bigger share of the prize money, and raises the stakes. </p> <p>Conflict is inherent in Big Brother because it is a competition. Treachery is essential, as Nick, the stockbroker, has realised. Maligned by the media he may be - the Sun's Dominic Mohan has started a Kick Out Nick campaign - but Nick is liked by his housemates. In this week's vote on eviction, no one has voted to have him ousted. He plays the game too well, as proved by his exploits last week, when he encouraged everyone to vote for Sada and Caroline's expulsion then provided them with a shoulder on which to cry. Like Mel, he is everyone's friend and friends with no one. Nick's continual scheming and continuing presence is a testament to Big Brother's dystopian underpinnings. If the lovely Tom gets chucked out before Nick - and it could happen - it may even prove the old maxim that good guys finish last. </p> <p>But it's not just the money that makes the exploits of the Big Brother housemates compelling. There is their naked desperation for fame and fortune. In the first show, Nichola came out with the bald statement: \"I want to be really rich and really famous.\" Like the others, she will do anything that (she thinks) will endear her to the nation and her roommates. Hence Craig's inability to keep his clothes on, Nichola's please-like-me-I'm-dead-wacky clay painting and Sada's New Age philosophies and singing. Their exploits are made all the more delicious by the gap between what a candidate thinks will endear him or her and what actually does. </p> <p>According to the official website, of the nine housemates left, six have said their dream job is in the media. Mel's ideal occupation is presenting a TV travel show, as is Nick's. Caroline's is writing and performing songs, while Craig wants to be a performer. Anna wants to work in the music industry and Darren is torn between presenting on MTV Europe and children's television. For them, Big Brother is a means to an end as well as a means in itself. Nick's two-facedness shows his awareness of the conventions of the game and how to subvert them. </p> <p>Big Brother is such a success because, unlike Castaway, it appeals to the base urges of human nature. Of Nick, Mel, Caroline, Anna, Darren, Andrew, Tom, Nichola and Craig only the strongest - or the most scheming - will survive. Popularity, not goodness nor morality, will persist. Were Ben Fogle to stumble into the Big Brother house, he would be voted out with Machiavellian swiftness. He is simply too nice to prosper. We all love a villain, and sometimes the good guys are just too dull. </p> <p>Most of the Big Brother housemates only care about winning, and those who don't care won't win. Where Castaway is about community, Big Brother is about individuality. That's why it's easier to relate to this lot than those marooned on Taransay. This is Thatcherism TV - 1984 indeed. </p> <p>\u0095 Big Brother is made by Bazal Productions, part-owned by the Guardian Media Group.</p>",

Nick's two-facedness shows his awareness of the conventions of the game and how to subvert them. Big Brother is such a success because, unlike Castaway, it appeals to the base urges of human nature. Of Nick, Mel, Caroline, Anna, Darren, Andrew, Tom, Nichola and Craig only the strongest - or the most scheming - will survive. Popularity, not goodness nor morality, will persist. Were Ben Fogle to stumble into the Big Brother house, he would be voted out with Machiavellian swiftness. He is simply too nice to prosper. We all love a villain, and sometimes the good guys are just too dull. Most of the Big Brother housemates only care about winning, and those who don't care won't win. Where Castaway is about community, Big Brother is about individuality. That's why it's easier to relate to this lot than those marooned on Taransay. This is Thatcherism TV - 1984 indeed. \u0095 Big Brother is made by Bazal Productions, part-owned by the Guardian Media Group.",

You can go to the new <a href=\"http://www.tapster.com\">Tapster site</a> and download the free MP3 of their comeback single, Back from the Dead. While there, why not download some more free MP3s of music \"inspired by, ripped off from and dedicated to Spinal Tap\". The press release notes: \"This will be far more controversial than Napster, really,\" said Tap's Nigel Tufnel. Bassist Derek Smalls added: \"We' re not unnecessarily concerned about intellectual property - this isn't about Harvard, Yale or Oxford.\" </p> <p><strong> Rude bits</strong><br> If the appeal of saccharine electronic postcards with those horrible tinkly computerised music tracks has just about worn off by now, how about going for a mix of naughty bits and atoms instead? At <a href=\"http://www.moonpig.com\" target=\"_new\">www.moonpig.com</a> you can use the web to send a proper paper card for \u00a31.99 plus P&amp;P, which they'll print out and sign for you. Of course there are clean cards there too, but we liked being able to choose from categories such as Beer and Beaujolais, Lavatorial, and Rumpy Pumpy. Extra bonus feature: a \"naughty filter\" lets you look at (or avoid) all the dirty-joke cards. </p> <p><strong> Top of the flops</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.lostmusicals.com\">Lost Musicals</a> is a UK-based site that lovingly chronicles all those painful flops and failures that fleetingly graced the West End and Broadway stages. Moby Dick, the musical, is among them, but you can read the playbills for others or keep an eye on promising failures in the Flopwatch section of the site. </p> <p><strong> Pop charts</strong><br> Factoid and pie graph fans will like the <a href=\"http://www.prb.org\">Population Reference Bureau</a>, which has every imaginable type of statistic relating to population for 221 countries. The subsection on the European region brings up details on world refugee populations, women's lives, the high death rate among Russian men, and more. </p> <p><strong> Apocamon now</strong><br> Many parents already consider Pokemon monsters to be a plague, so the existence of Apocalypse Monsters, or Apocamon, may come as no surprise. See them in full colour and read all about each one at <a href=\"http://www.e-sheep.com/apocamon/apocadex/\">Apocamon, the Final Judgement</a>. A drop-down menu encyclopedia lets you \"find out their powers, their missions, and which segments of humanity they intend to destroy\". If you doubt the authenticity of Apokemon, note that the site's contents are copyright 80AD to St John the Divine. </p> <p><strong> Money talks</strong><br> Political activism is alive and well on the web, even for billionaires. They are getting organised for the US presidential election at billionaires for Bush or Gore <a href=\"http://www.billionairesforbushorgore.com\">www.billionairesforbushorgore.com</a> \"because inequality is not growing fast enough\". To further their ends, they offer a price/performance analysis of the presidential candidates, and invite visitors to participate in the ultimate posh protest, the Million Billionaire March. If you prefer to rebel at home, the site also offers a section full of useful chants and slogans. \"Take to your cell phones, take to your faxes, Join the fight to end all taxes!\" </p> <p><strong> Happy eaters</strong><br> Finding vegetarian-friendly restaurants can be tough, but it is especially hard for travelling veggie lovers. Globetrotting vegetarians might want to check out the <a href=\"http://www.happycow.net\">Happy Cow</a>, which offers a listing of more than 1,600 vegetarian restaurants all around the world. </p> <p><strong> Boo hoo</strong><br> Reports of the death of the net economy may be exaggerated. But there is a certain grim fascination in watching things go wrong, and sites are springing up to follow the death throes of assorted dot.coms. Best known is <a href=\"http://www.fuckedcompany.com\">www.fuckedcompany.com</a>, \"the dot com deadpool\", which relishes kicking 'em while they're down. More mainstream is Bubble Economy at <a href=\"http://www.bubbleeconomy.com\">www.bubbleeconomy.com</a> (\"prepare for the pop\"), which tracks the business pundits as they voice their internet angst. </p> <p><strong> Jargon watch</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.logophilia.com/WordSpy\"> WordSpy</a> is a word-a-day site dedicated to recently coined words or words that are staging a comeback but used in new ways.

      "bodyText": "Spinal Tapster While a certain heavy metal band - yes, you know the one! - seems to have some kind of problem with MP3s, archetypal headbangers Spinal Tap, thankfully, do not, especially when they are looking for ways to promote the September re-release of their film This Is Spinal Tap. You can go to the new Tapster site and download the free MP3 of their comeback single, Back from the Dead. While there, why not download some more free MP3s of music \"inspired by, ripped off from and dedicated to Spinal Tap\". The press release notes: \"This will be far more controversial than Napster, really,\" said Tap's Nigel Tufnel. Bassist Derek Smalls added: \"We' re not unnecessarily concerned about intellectual property - this isn't about Harvard, Yale or Oxford.\" Rude bits If the appeal of saccharine electronic postcards with those horrible tinkly computerised music tracks has just about worn off by now, how about going for a mix of naughty bits and atoms instead? At www.moonpig.com you can use the web to send a proper paper card for \u00a31.99 plus P&amp;P, which they'll print out and sign for you. Of course there are clean cards there too, but we liked being able to choose from categories such as Beer and Beaujolais, Lavatorial, and Rumpy Pumpy. Extra bonus feature: a \"naughty filter\" lets you look at (or avoid) all the dirty-joke cards. Top of the flops Lost Musicals is a UK-based site that lovingly chronicles all those painful flops and failures that fleetingly graced the West End and Broadway stages. Moby Dick, the musical, is among them, but you can read the playbills for others or keep an eye on promising failures in the Flopwatch section of the site. Pop charts Factoid and pie graph fans will like the Population Reference Bureau, which has every imaginable type of statistic relating to population for 221 countries. The subsection on the European region brings up details on world refugee populations, women's lives, the high death rate among Russian men, and more. Apocamon now Many parents already consider Pokemon monsters to be a plague, so the existence of Apocalypse Monsters, or Apocamon, may come as no surprise. See them in full colour and read all about each one at Apocamon, the Final Judgement. A drop-down menu encyclopedia lets you \"find out their powers, their missions, and which segments of humanity they intend to destroy\". If you doubt the authenticity of Apokemon, note that the site's contents are copyright 80AD to St John the Divine. Money talks Political activism is alive and well on the web, even for billionaires. They are getting organised for the US presidential election at billionaires for Bush or Gore www.billionairesforbushorgore.com \"because inequality is not growing fast enough\". To further their ends, they offer a price/performance analysis of the presidential candidates, and invite visitors to participate in the ultimate posh protest, the Million Billionaire March. If you prefer to rebel at home, the site also offers a section full of useful chants and slogans. \"Take to your cell phones, take to your faxes, Join the fight to end all taxes!\" Happy eaters Finding vegetarian-friendly restaurants can be tough, but it is especially hard for travelling veggie lovers. Globetrotting vegetarians might want to check out the Happy Cow, which offers a listing of more than 1,600 vegetarian restaurants all around the world. Boo hoo Reports of the death of the net economy may be exaggerated. But there is a certain grim fascination in watching things go wrong, and sites are springing up to follow the death throes of assorted dot.coms. Best known is www.fuckedcompany.com, \"the dot com deadpool\", which relishes kicking 'em while they're down. More mainstream is Bubble Economy at www.bubbleeconomy.com (\"prepare for the pop\"), which tracks the business pundits as they voice their internet angst.

The nice multicultural Republicanism of the first three days had really begun to scare the Democrats, for whom the low point was General Colin Powell's rousing appeal for racial inclusion on Monday night. In a presidential race in which Mr Gore is trailing by more than 10 points, the Democrats are longing for the mean-spirited, middle-aged white men of the Republicans' 1994 revolution led by Newt Gingrich (another name not even whispered in this year's convention). Possibly for that reason, President Clinton has appeared in recent days to play the role of goad, taunting George W Bush for his alleged reliance on \"daddy\" to fight the election, nearly provoking George senior into losing his temper, but not quite. Even if George the younger resumes the upbeat, positive tone of the convention, the Democrats will still have Dick Cheney to gnaw on. They have his past congressional votes: against the release of Nelson Mandela from an apartheid jail, and against the Head Start educational assistance programme for poor children. Now he has turned negative. It stoked the crowd and made him the party's darling for the night, but it also meant that the happy-smiley mask, elaborately painted in many hues over the first 72 hours of the convention, finally slipped.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Can you refresh my memory about that famous Test which was abandoned when protesters dug up the pitch?</strong> asks Steve Sheekey </p> <p>It was the third Test between England and Australia at Headingley in August 1975. The match was evenly poised going into the final day: England had made 288 (David Steele 73, John Edrich 62, Tony Greig 51, Gary Gilmour 6-85) and 291 (Steele 92, Greig 49). Australia were bowled out for 135 (Phil Edmonds 5-28 on debut), raising hopes that England would level the series at 1-1. Needing 425 to win, Australia had reached 220 for 3 by the end of the fourth day. But when the players arrived next morning they discovered that part of the pitch had been dug up, and oil had also been poured on it. The perpetrators were campaigning for the release of George Davis, a small-time criminal who had recently been convicted and imprisoned. The match was abandoned (it then rained for much of the day, so it would probably have been a draw anyway). The main sufferer was Australia's opener Rick McCosker, who was stranded on 95 not out. At the time he had not scored a Test century - but he put that right with 127 in the next Test, at the Oval. That match was also drawn, with Bob Woolmer making 149 for England, and Australia took the series 1-0. </p> <p> <strong> Can you tell me the address of Rashid Latif's website?</strong> asks Waqar Ali </p> <p>Rashid Latif is the former Pakistan captain and wicketkeeper who has been one of the loudest voices in the fight to expose match-fixing. You can find his website at www.rashidlatif.8k.com </p> <p> <strong> Where and when was the first day/night one-day international played?</strong> asks Chinta Rajap from Switzerland </p> <p>The first matches under floodlights were played during Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket at the end of the 1970s, but they don't count as official one-day internationals. The first official one-dayer under lights was Australia v West Indies at Sydney on Nov 27, 1979. Australia, batting second, won by five wickets. The first man to score an international century under lights was Allan Border, with 105* for Australia v India at Sydney on Dec 18, 1980. Geoff Boycott (105 for England v Australia, Melbourne 1979-80) and Greg Chappell (138* for Australia v New Zealand, Sydney, 1980-81) scored centuries in day/night matches before Border, but unlike him they batted in the first innings of the match, before the lights had taken effect.</p> <p> <strong> Can you tell me who topped the batting averages for the 1998-99 Sheffield Shield season please? There's a lot riding on this one</strong> says Craig Hodges </p> <p>It was Darren Lehmann, of South Australia, who made 539 runs in the Sheffield Shield alone at an average of 134.75.

      "bodyText": "Can you refresh my memory about that famous Test which was abandoned when protesters dug up the pitch? asks Steve Sheekey It was the third Test between England and Australia at Headingley in August 1975. The match was evenly poised going into the final day: England had made 288 (David Steele 73, John Edrich 62, Tony Greig 51, Gary Gilmour 6-85) and 291 (Steele 92, Greig 49). Australia were bowled out for 135 (Phil Edmonds 5-28 on debut), raising hopes that England would level the series at 1-1. Needing 425 to win, Australia had reached 220 for 3 by the end of the fourth day. But when the players arrived next morning they discovered that part of the pitch had been dug up, and oil had also been poured on it. The perpetrators were campaigning for the release of George Davis, a small-time criminal who had recently been convicted and imprisoned. The match was abandoned (it then rained for much of the day, so it would probably have been a draw anyway). The main sufferer was Australia's opener Rick McCosker, who was stranded on 95 not out. At the time he had not scored a Test century - but he put that right with 127 in the next Test, at the Oval. That match was also drawn, with Bob Woolmer making 149 for England, and Australia took the series 1-0. Can you tell me the address of Rashid Latif's website? asks Waqar Ali Rashid Latif is the former Pakistan captain and wicketkeeper who has been one of the loudest voices in the fight to expose match-fixing. You can find his website at www.rashidlatif.8k.com Where and when was the first day/night one-day international played? asks Chinta Rajap from Switzerland The first matches under floodlights were played during Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket at the end of the 1970s, but they don't count as official one-day internationals. The first official one-dayer under lights was Australia v West Indies at Sydney on Nov 27, 1979. Australia, batting second, won by five wickets. The first man to score an international century under lights was Allan Border, with 105* for Australia v India at Sydney on Dec 18, 1980. Geoff Boycott (105 for England v Australia, Melbourne 1979-80) and Greg Chappell (138* for Australia v New Zealand, Sydney, 1980-81) scored centuries in day/night matches before Border, but unlike him they batted in the first innings of the match, before the lights had taken effect. Can you tell me who topped the batting averages for the 1998-99 Sheffield Shield season please? There's a lot riding on this one says Craig Hodges It was Darren Lehmann, of South Australia, who made 539 runs in the Sheffield Shield alone at an average of 134.75. Michael Bevan of New South Wales was second with 636 runs at 106.00. In all first-class matches in Australia in 1998-99 the highest average was 118.70 by Greg Blewett, who scored two centuries for an Australian XI as well as four more for South Australia. In all first-class matches Lehmann averaged 65.78.

The Prison Officers' Association held hour long illegal meetings in protest at the announcement that the first operating public sector prison would be market tested. But last night Martin Narey, director general of the prison service, said he would dock the pay of prison officers failing to turn up to work, but refrain from taking high court action against the union. Under legislation passed by the last government prison officers are banned from taking strike action. \"I am extremely disappointed at the POA's foolish decision to hold unauthorised meetings in prisons. Those who have not gone to work this morning will have their pay stopped. If the POA repeats this action, I will have no hesitation in seeking a high court injunction,\" said Mr Narey. The dispute with the POA intensified last week when the union decided to withdraw the \"goodwill\" of its 30,000 members in protest at the privatisation of the south London prison, which is one of the union's strongholds. In retaliation, the prisons minister, Paul Boateng, postponed the promised introduction of a pay review body for the prison service which has taken three years' negotiation with the Treasury. The union wants talks about the plan to test-market Brixton, but the prison service says the decision is not open to negotiation. \"The market testing of Brixton prison is going ahead and market tests are inevitable,\" said Mr Narey. Mark Healey, POA chairman, said: \"The damaging effects of privatisation are well documented. Private sector assault rates are twice those in the public sector . \"Mr Boateng's policy shows scant regard for the health and safety of prisoners and prison officers.\" Mr Boateng's plan to market test Brixton and offer it to one of Britain's five private jail companies followed a damning report by Sir David Ramsbotham, the chief inspector of prisons, who said standards at the jail were appalling. Under the 1994 Criminal Justice Act, the POA was banned from taking industrial action by the then Conservative home secretary, Michael Howard. Although there have been small-scale outbreaks of unrest the Home Office has yet to take any high court action to enforce the ban.",

Now his cover is blown and he is heading for Hollywood, and the lawyers of those he helped to jail are heading for the appeal courts. Andrew Chambers, 43, is a native of St Louis, a former altar boy and cub scout, and a street-savvy operator who always fancied a career in law enforcement. But his failure to achieve a college degree meant that his opportunities were limited and, after a spell in the marines, he opted for the dangerous and unconventional role of undercover informer for the drug enforcement administration (DEA). His particular skill was making drug dealers believe he was the genuine article. His abilities earned him more than $2m in payment and expenses over a 16-year period. He operated throughout the country, from New Orleans to Baltimore and Boston to Houston, but his greatest successes were in the Los Angeles area, where 300 of the arrests he assisted in took place. Unlike most informers, he always claimed that he had no criminal convictions and was motivated mainly by the desire to nail drug dealers. When giving evidence he would tell the court that he had never been arrested. But a dogged defence lawyer from Orange county, California, Dean Steward, became suspicious. He started investigating his background and found that he had, in fact, been arrested 16 times and had convictions for soliciting prostitutes. Mr Steward placed a mock-up \"wanted\" poster of Mr Chambers on the internet to warn other defence lawyers about the informer's past. As a result, the DEA has \"deactivated\" Mr Chambers and dropped charges against 15 alleged drug dealers about whom he would have testified. With his cover blown, Mr Chambers has \"come out\" as an informer, to such an extent that he has been having talks about his career being the subject of a film or television series by the director Spike Lee's company. Mary Aloe, of Proud Mary Productions in Beverly Hills, confirmed yesterday that a deal was likely and that James Manos, who has written and produced for The Sopranos, was involved. \"It's pretty hot,\" Ms Aloe said, adding that there were enough \"funny and scary\" moments in Mr Chambers's career to make a whole television series. The successful Martin Scorcese film Goodfellas was based on the true story of an informer who was excused serious drug-dealing crimes because of the criminals he was able to help convict. \"I was truthful about what happened when the deal was going on,\" Mr Chambers said in an online chat after he went public earlier this month. \"I'm really an agent without a badge and a gun.\" He also said he had solicited a prostitute in Denver in 1995 - she turned out to be an undercover officer - because he thought that she might lead him to a drug dealer. He was proud of his work, assuming a variety of different identities and passing on some occasions as a Latino called \"Rico\". The DEA suggest that he had lied only out of embarrassment and that other dishonest areas of his life which came under scrutiny, such as inaccurate tax returns, should not affect the reliability of his evidence. They point to the fact that 95% of the defendants in the cases in which he was an informer pleaded guilty. Defence lawyers disagree, and are now re-examining 295 cases in which he was involved. \"When you get a guy who would lie about just about everything else, why do you think he would tell the truth about what led up to the deal?\" Mr Steward said after the news of Mr Chambers's background broke. \"It's a corrupting system,\" a leading Californian defence lawyer, Ian Loveseth, said yesterday. \"There's money flowing every which way. These guys make money, they do stings, they're professional. \"It's corrupting to the agency because they're forced to condone perjury.

He accuses the leader of dishonesty and hypocrisy, for making progressive noises on gay rights in private while clinging to the homophobic section 28 in public. \"That's not leadership, it's weakness,\" writes Mr Massow, using the one word Hagueites most dread. He accuses the Tory leader of \"prejudice and ignorance\" and says the Tories cannot be trusted to run Britain: trust, too, is a word Conservatives fear being used against them. Finally he takes a shot at the party's tax plans: as a financial expert, he declares them \"ludicrous\".</p> <p>But it is the bigger picture that should truly concern William Hague. Mr Massow's defection exposes the choice the Tory leader has made. He could have opted for a British version of the \"compassionate conservatism\" currently selling itself at the Republican convention in Philadelphia. He could have forged a fiscally conservative, socially inclusive party which would have welcomed a liberal, gay man like Mr Massow. Instead, despite this week's trek to pay homage to George W Bush, Mr Hague has headed in the reverse direction. He has gone for cold-hearted conservatism, characterised by a hard-faced attitude to homosexuals and asylum seekers. This is what Mr Massow could not live with.</p> <p>The Conservative high command may believe there are still more votes in pleasing the Daily Mail than the likes of Mr Massow. But the experience of America's Republicans suggest otherwise.</p>",

Finally he takes a shot at the party's tax plans: as a financial expert, he declares them \"ludicrous\". But it is the bigger picture that should truly concern William Hague. Mr Massow's defection exposes the choice the Tory leader has made. He could have opted for a British version of the \"compassionate conservatism\" currently selling itself at the Republican convention in Philadelphia. He could have forged a fiscally conservative, socially inclusive party which would have welcomed a liberal, gay man like Mr Massow. Instead, despite this week's trek to pay homage to George W Bush, Mr Hague has headed in the reverse direction. He has gone for cold-hearted conservatism, characterised by a hard-faced attitude to homosexuals and asylum seekers. This is what Mr Massow could not live with. The Conservative high command may believe there are still more votes in pleasing the Daily Mail than the likes of Mr Massow. But the experience of America's Republicans suggest otherwise.",

      "bodyText": "The wealthy Conservative businessman Ivan Massow defected to New Labour after the party he served for 18 years persistently failed to select him to fight a Commons seat, it emerged last night. Tony Blair's latest convert condemned \"bigots\" in local Conservative associations. They had repeatedly declined even to interview him when he was searching for a constituency, according to those who heard him talk of his growing disillusionment. But senior Tories, led by Steve Norris, who made Mr Massow an adviser to his campaign for mayor of London, insisted yesterday that the 32-year-old millionaire was \"a great self-publicist\". He had what Mr Norris called a \"massively exaggerated sense of his own importance\" to the party, which he joined at the age of 14. Mr Massow, a financial services specialist with a serious interest in culture and mental health, had not done enough grassroots work to earn a nomination, said Mr Norris (now a Tory party vice- chairman). Nor had he ever made donations to party funds. But both Mr Norris and aides to William Hague admitted that the Tory leader knew and liked Mr Massow, with whom he had discussed policy during face to face meetings. Mr Massow, both sides agreed, feels that Mr Hague has now abandoned his early commitment to \"inclusive\" social policies in favour of hard line positions on sex, race and asylum. According to those present the avowedly gay businessman was close to tears shortly before he switched political sides at a recent party in Westminster to launch a Centre for Policy Studies pamphlet on Ulster. Tom Watson, a former Labour apparatchik, said Mr Massow complained that many local parties refused to distribute his CV because he was gay. \"He was clearly distressed,\" said Mr Watson. \"I ended up feeling sorry for the guy after he explained what he had to put up with.\" Labour's Millbank HQ yesterday insisted no deal had been done to find Mr Massow a Labour seat. \"It wasn't discussed, he didn't ask for a seat,\" said one senior official, who revealed that Mr Massow's distress became so widely known that Labour approached him. Hague aides admitted regret, but said that Mr Massow had never been an adviser to the Tory leader and had not been on the official candidates list - as re ported - only on the \"deferred list\" pending greater evidence of commitment. \"He needed to distribute a few more leaflets and bang on more doors,\" a party spokesman said. Mr Norris's version of events was that Mr Massow had been told to \"come back when you've done something more for the party\". He revealed that he had dined with Mr Massow three weeks ago, when the businessman expressed the same concerns about Tory policy on section 28 repeal and Mr Hague's doomed \"tax guarantee\" as he did in yesterday's Independent. \"He was clearly unhappy and clearly felt he'd been let down by William Hague over section 28 and William's original commitment to inclusiveness, tolerance and openness which he felt were being jettisoned in favour of the Daily Mail and Telegraph,\" said Mr Norris, himself a social liberal. \"Had he talked about leaving the party I would have said 'that's a very silly thing to do'. I like the guy, but his departure has no significance whatsoever.\" Mr Norris also mischievously asked how the defector's enthusiasm for fox-hunting (he is a master of fox hounds) would play in his new party. Most Labour constituencies have already selected their candidates for the general election and the party hierarchy is still struggling to find a berth for Witney's MP, Shaun Woodward, who left the Tories for Labour over Mr Hague's reluctance to back repeal of section 28, which has been abandoned by Labour after being blocked by the Lords. At the time Mr Massow criticised Mr Woodward's defection and claimed Mr Hague's line on gay sex \"vindicated him in his efforts to modernise the party\". Parties usually mistrust defectors and Mr Massow's changing views and pro-hunting stance will not easily endear him to a Labour party still suspicious of former Tories. Ex-Conservative MP Alan Howarth is now arts minister but underwent a painful public conversion when still on the Tory benches under John Major. Peter Temple-Morris, a later defector, says he is warmly welcomed by Labour members. So is Mr Woodward when he tours the country, warning voters of the dangers of a party he knows well as one of its former propaganda chiefs, according to Millbank. In reality the Witney MP is still treated with suspicion, being forced to visit marginal seats and co-author a book attacking the Tories with two other Labour MPs. Mr Massow has an upwardly-mobile CV that attracts attention. A man about town during the week, he is something of a country squire at weekends with half a dozen horses and a spaniel called Freddie. On Saturdays he is a whipper-in for the East Sussex and Romney Marsh foxhounds, and on Sundays he is joint master of the Cokeham Bloodhounds. His company, Massow Financial Services in Covent Garden, central London, was the first to offer insurance to gay men and people with HIV. As well as making a decent living, his rising profile saw him become chairman of the Institute of Contemporary Art. Mr Massow also supports Mind and the Samaritans as well as Outrage! and Stonewall. He took up counselling after a partner, James Knight, a hairdresser, committed suicide. Since Labour took office he has done a government-funded study on mental illness and worked with Mind. At one stage Mr Massow reportedly considered having a baby with the lesbian actress Jackie Clune. Though critics accuse him of inflating his wealth, he is certainly a paper millionaire. His political importance is less tangible.

A decision to hold a vote was taken at the party's national policy forum and since then young Labour activists and students have been preparing a campaign to win the backing of the party's national executive committee. The proposal would be included in Labour's election manifesto and is seen as a way of winning the support of first time voters. Official statistics suggest there are 729,000 16-year-olds and 742,000 17-year- olds, and advocates of the change claim it will increase voter turnout amongst the young and help set a more logical definition of adulthood. Paul Boateng, the government's spokesman on youth issues and a Home Office minister, has told party members he welcomed the debate on lowering the voting age, even if the government remained to be convinced. Daniel Zeichner, a delegate from the party's eastern region to the policy forum who tabled the proposal, said yesterday: \"You can win the lottery at 16 and you can have sex, but you cannot vote. That does not seem consistent.\" He argued the change could be made in 2002, when a Labour government is due to introduce citizenship education in schools. He also argued that if young people could drink alcohol, get married with parental consent, join the army, and have heterosexual intercourse at 16, they should be allowed to vote. Similarly, it is claimed that 16-year-olds are required to make themselves available for work or training, or lose benefit, and should therefore be entitled to vote. The proposal has the support of the National Union of Students and Young Labour, the party's youth wing. Claire McCarthy, its representative on the party's national executive, said: \"This idea makes sense in the context of doing something to engage people in politics in schools.\" Simon Hughes, the home affairs spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, said it was time Labour had a debate but predicted: \"I fear Jack Straw will not see this as a priority, but just as something to dangle in front of the 18-25 age group.\" There will also be a move at party conference to have the reformed Westminster second chamber largely elected.

The Tories have committed themselves to a largely elected chamber, but Labour has yet to adopt a definitive position. The Labour leadership will come under separate pressure on the issue from the Liberal Democrats, who are due to discuss the reformed second chamber at a meeting of the Lib-Labour joint consultative committee of the cabinet. The two issues are likely to be the most controversial alternative resolutions put to the party conference from the policy forum, being the first time the conference will vote on alternative positions adopted by the forum. In another issue, the big unions are united behind a push to raise the basic state pension, probably by linking it with earnings, partly in the hope it will force the chancellor, Gordon Brown, to come up with a generous package. Mr Brown has said he is looking at changing the minimum income guarantee to reward low income pensioners who have made some pension provision for themselves, and those just above guarantee levels, and the unions will want this spelled out or will seek to put an emergency motion. The unions are also mounting a push, mainly through the TUC annual congress, to press the chancellor to prepare Britain for the single currency.

      "body": "<p>An American visitor to the Duveen gallery at the British Museum is telling a companion about the Greek campaign for the return of the Elgin marbles. They can only have them back when they've proved themselves worthy, he says. </p> <p>At the other end of the melancholy grey hall, a guard is telling two children that Lord Elgin took the sculptures when there was a war in Greece and saved them from being lost for ever. You start to suspect everyone here is talking or thinking about the one thing everyone knows about the Elgin marbles - that there is an international row about them. We have all come here to see the \"controversial Elgin marbles\". </p> <p>Something has disappeared from the experience of looking at these pieces of carved stone. In all the arguments and scandals, we have lost track of why they were ever considered important. Was it to do with Greek nationalism or British imperialism? Was it because of the way Lord Elgin obtained them? </p> <p>It was none of these things. The Elgin marbles matter because they are uniquely beautiful. </p> <p>When the marbles were put on display in the British Museum in 1817, John Keats kept coming back to sit before them. The fourth verse of his Ode on a Grecian Urn describes images from the Parthenon frieze. \"Who are these coming to the sacrifice?\" What all those hours of solitary looking told Keats was: \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - that is all ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" </p> <p>It is hard to recall those words looking at the Parthenon frieze today, or the metopes - the sculptures of centaurs fighting humans from the outer frieze - because the weight of modern history has crushed the lightness of this ancient art. Even the architecture of the Duveen gallery - a 1930s mausoleum of a place - speaks of authority and the museum. Where is the dance of beauty that Keats saw? It's there, but you have to think past the disputes and the words. </p> <p>More of these words were published recently in a report by the parliamentary select committee on culture, media and sport. In June the committee, chaired by Gerald Kaufman, was addressed by Greek foreign minister George Papandreou, who presented a radically revised proposal for the return of the Parthenon sculptures to Athens. </p> <p>Papandreou said Greece does not want to force the issue of ownership. Instead it simply wants to see the sculptures in Athens, displayed in a specially built museum as close as possible to the Parthenon, in time for the Olympics in 2004. \"This masterpiece must be reunified,\" he argued, \"its integrity restored - within its original historical and cultural environment in Athens.\" But Papandreou was wasting his breath: Tory committee members boycotted the hearing and Alastair Campbell briefed journalists that the government has no intention of returning the sculptures. </p> <p>Arts minister Alan Howarth, who addressed the select committee on behalf of the British government, agreed to speak to me about the beauty of the marbles. A great aesthetic experience, he says, is one that \"rises above the banal: a heightened experience in which the whole personality is committed\". Is beauty important in his job? It is, apparently. Howarth values \"that heightened experience of acuteness, that sense that you're dealing with things that are transcendentally important\" and says his job as arts minister is to diffuse such experiences more widely. He cites a government scheme to encourage experiment in architecture. \"Why should we tolerate mediocrity and ugliness in our buildings? It's quite unnecessary.\" </p> <p>That's great, but it is also the reason why we should cooperate with the Greeks to reunite the most beautiful conjunction of architecture and art the world has known. Isn't the reason the marbles should go back to Athens that their beauty will be appreciated there at its most powerful? Isn't this a unique chance for a Labour government to increase the beauty in the world? \"I think that's an enormously seductive case; it isn't the case the Greeks are putting to us.\" </p> <p>Yet in effect it is. \"The visitor or the researcher will be able to juxtapose the marbles in the museum with the Parthenon, as they will be situated there,\" Papandreou told the select committee. \"There will be a true sense of the aesthetics and the historical and cultural context which they were in.\" </p> <p>The beauty of the Elgin marbles is one thing; the beauty of the Parthenon is another. The sculptures that Elgin brought to London are part of the works commissioned by the Athenian statesman Pericles to celebrate the city-state's repulsion of a Persian invasion. The Parthenon housed a statue of the goddess Athena by the sculptor Phidias, credited as architect of the Parthenon. Under his supervision carvers created the exterior decorations, including the frieze, which depicts in low relief representatives of the entire Athenian people processing to the Acropolis in the festival of the Panatheneia. </p> <p>In history it was the building as a whole that impressed. \"It is extraordinary and it was extraordinary in its day,\" says Ian Jenkins, assistant keeper in the department of Greek and Roman antiquities at the British Museum. \"It has many additions and embellishments that represented in its day a great aesthetic challenge. Its beauty has persisted because of the sheer quality of its workmanship and the intelligence of its design.\" </p> <p>Despite having been blown up by the Venetians in 1682 when it was used by a Turkish garrison as a gunpowder store, the Parthenon is still standing. When you see its honey-coloured pillars against the blue sky, you don't feel you're looking at a ruin. The pillars have a delicate rhythm, echoed in the horses cantering on the frieze. It may be a ceremonial building, but it is also a human one. It seems to soar, and makes you feel more alive to look at it. It is incomparably beautiful. </p> <p>\"The Parthenon sculptures participated in that beauty,\" says Jenkins, \"but they participated as architectural ornament. It wasn't until the 18th century that people began to look really closely at them as art.\" </p> <p>Jenkins makes what appears to be a nimble case for the marbles to stay at the British Museum - although he will not make his position explicit. When they were in their original place at the top of the temple 40ft above the ground, he says, visitors could not see the details. They can only be studied up close because Elgin removed them. \"They have become this great icon of western art because they were removed. They're physically transformed, but also conceptually transformed: they became what they are through their repositioning. That transformation is an irreversible one: once you have made a museum object by displaying them at eye level, you cannot then see them other than as a result of that process.\" </p> <p>Or as the British Museum's case is summarised in the select committee report: \"The marbles are now irrevocably established as museum pieces.\" </p> <p>When I speak to Alan Howarth about the marbles, he says: \"What we're really talking about is the principle of what is in a museum.\" The government currently takes its line from the British Museum; it is a sophisticated line that sees museums as timeless public spaces, beyond national boundaries, implicitly portraying the Greek claim as narrowly nationalist. </p> <p>Beauty is not timeless, though, and it is not indestructible. Even if some of us can get closer to the marbles, they are reduced as museum pieces. They have become icons rather than a beautiful element in a larger architectural whole. Brought up on a neo-classical ideal of beauty, 19th-century spectators like Keats were stunned by the delicacy of the Parthenon sculptures: the naturalistic depiction of anatomy, the social detail of the crowd, the fact that these were real people in a real time and place. We can't recapture that in the Duveen gallery partly because of the row: by being controversial, the marbles have become invisible. Yet most visitors to Athens are overwhelmed by the Acropolis. To put the marbles back in this context would shock us into seeing them again. This would not be a simple restoration but something more interesting. It would make a new beauty available, bringing the modern cult of the Elgin marbles together with the ancient authority of the Parthenon. The beauty of the Parthenon and its sculptures leaves all other arguments out in the cold, including the issue of creating a precedent. </p> <p>It's no insult to ancient Egypt or Benin art or even the rest of ancient Greek art to call the Parthenon uniquely beautiful. The beauty of the Parthenon makes it a special case. It's our loss if we find reasons not to worship beauty and condemn ourselves to a life of aesthetic squalor. </p> <p> The marbles, says Alan Howarth, are \"a monument not just to Greece but, by their very presence in this country, to the cultural influence of ancient Greece\". But that influence has long since been absorbed. In the end it is sophistry to say that the marbles have become beautiful by being removed from the Parthenon. It suppresses the possibility of seeing things whole. We are bombarded with micro-aesthetic experiences every day: we eat beautiful meals, buy beautiful clothes. But is there a place for a great beauty that changes the world? </p> <p>The return of the Elgin marbles has been a rallying call for the British left from Lord Byron to Christopher Hitchens. This is not just sympathy with Greek nationalists; it comes from a recognition of beauty as a political good. The Parthenon frieze is a monument not to a monarch but to a democratic city-state. It is a beautiful vision of a radically democratic society. Of course Byron and Keats went woozy over it, and so should we. </p> <p>I ask Alan Howarth again why the government doesn't take this chance to do something beautiful. \"I think I have to rest on the position I've already stated.'\"</p>",

The marbles, says Alan Howarth, are \"a monument not just to Greece but, by their very presence in this country, to the cultural influence of ancient Greece\". But that influence has long since been absorbed. In the end it is sophistry to say that the marbles have become beautiful by being removed from the Parthenon. It suppresses the possibility of seeing things whole. We are bombarded with micro-aesthetic experiences every day: we eat beautiful meals, buy beautiful clothes. But is there a place for a great beauty that changes the world? The return of the Elgin marbles has been a rallying call for the British left from Lord Byron to Christopher Hitchens. This is not just sympathy with Greek nationalists; it comes from a recognition of beauty as a political good. The Parthenon frieze is a monument not to a monarch but to a democratic city-state. It is a beautiful vision of a radically democratic society. Of course Byron and Keats went woozy over it, and so should we. I ask Alan Howarth again why the government doesn't take this chance to do something beautiful. \"I think I have to rest on the position I've already stated.'\"",

      "body": "<p>The chancellor, Gordon Brown, last night finally threw prudence aside by announcing that he is to marry his long standing partner Sarah Macaulay today in his local parish church in Dunfermline.</p> <p>The marriage, trailed inaccurately for years by Mr Brown's former spin doctor Charlie Whelan, caught Westminster by surprise, and will delight his colleagues. The end to what seemed years of hesitation was announced in a one line statement from his special adviser at the Treasury.</p> <p>Mr Brown told Tony and Cherie Blair of his intentions yesterday and they were said to be delighted. They will not be attending the ceremony which will be a private affair for the couple's close friends and family only.</p> <p>It emerged that Mr Brown proposed to Miss Macaulay in January and the couple fixed a date for the wedding shortly afterwards. The announcement had been displayed in the normal way in the parish where the ceremony will take place.</p> <p>After the wedding, there will be a small reception for close family. The pair will then leave for a secret honeymoon. Mr Brown was due to fly to the couple's holiday retreat at Cape Cod in the US on Saturday. Many believed that Mr Brown had cooled on the idea of marriage to the publicist Ms Macaulay, expecting instead to see the chancellor devote his life to budget surpluses and convergence criteria. It was said he spent many of his holidays in the US with his head buried in economics text books, leaving Ms Macaulay exasperated.</p> <p>Mr Brown has always eschewed questions about his relationship, allowing himself to be depicted as a bachelor devoid of romance and wedded to ambition. Those who know the couple well say the picture is false, and he relies on Ms Macaulay greatly for political and personal advice. She regularly attends his frequent parties at 11 Downing Street.</p> <p>Ms Macaulay has worked in a public affairs consultancy with Julia Hobsbawm, the daughter of the Marxist historian, Eric Hobsbawm. Like Mr Brown she is a Scot, and lived in Falkirk. She is the eldest of three children and the daughter of an educational publisher. They have been dating each other since 1994, but news of their relationship did not surface until April 1995.</p> <p>As long ago as 1997, it was claimed that the couple were secretly engaged and it was their intention to marry after the 1997 general election.</p> <p>Mr Brown apparently delayed the announcement of the marriage until the summer recess to minimise publicity. He managed to keep it secret from the entire cabinet, just as he has managed to keep many of his colleagues in the dark about his plans for the budget.</p> <p>According to Mr Whelan, \"Gordon wanted to get married privately and he's going to do just that. He and Sarah are very much in love and very excited about tying the knot\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "The chancellor, Gordon Brown, last night finally threw prudence aside by announcing that he is to marry his long standing partner Sarah Macaulay today in his local parish church in Dunfermline. The marriage, trailed inaccurately for years by Mr Brown's former spin doctor Charlie Whelan, caught Westminster by surprise, and will delight his colleagues. The end to what seemed years of hesitation was announced in a one line statement from his special adviser at the Treasury. Mr Brown told Tony and Cherie Blair of his intentions yesterday and they were said to be delighted. They will not be attending the ceremony which will be a private affair for the couple's close friends and family only. It emerged that Mr Brown proposed to Miss Macaulay in January and the couple fixed a date for the wedding shortly afterwards. The announcement had been displayed in the normal way in the parish where the ceremony will take place. After the wedding, there will be a small reception for close family. The pair will then leave for a secret honeymoon. Mr Brown was due to fly to the couple's holiday retreat at Cape Cod in the US on Saturday. Many believed that Mr Brown had cooled on the idea of marriage to the publicist Ms Macaulay, expecting instead to see the chancellor devote his life to budget surpluses and convergence criteria. It was said he spent many of his holidays in the US with his head buried in economics text books, leaving Ms Macaulay exasperated. Mr Brown has always eschewed questions about his relationship, allowing himself to be depicted as a bachelor devoid of romance and wedded to ambition. Those who know the couple well say the picture is false, and he relies on Ms Macaulay greatly for political and personal advice. She regularly attends his frequent parties at 11 Downing Street. Ms Macaulay has worked in a public affairs consultancy with Julia Hobsbawm, the daughter of the Marxist historian, Eric Hobsbawm. Like Mr Brown she is a Scot, and lived in Falkirk. She is the eldest of three children and the daughter of an educational publisher. They have been dating each other since 1994, but news of their relationship did not surface until April 1995. As long ago as 1997, it was claimed that the couple were secretly engaged and it was their intention to marry after the 1997 general election. Mr Brown apparently delayed the announcement of the marriage until the summer recess to minimise publicity. He managed to keep it secret from the entire cabinet, just as he has managed to keep many of his colleagues in the dark about his plans for the budget. According to Mr Whelan, \"Gordon wanted to get married privately and he's going to do just that. He and Sarah are very much in love and very excited about tying the knot\".",

His work ranged from the romantic to the funny - and weird.</p> <p>Sultanpuri was the only lyricist of his generation who remained in demand, and kept writing. Some critics charged that he composed songs which were below his best during the last decade, but his rejoinder was that a lyricist had to change with the times.</p> <p>He wrote two major collections of Urdu poetry, and was the first film lyricist to be honoured, in 1993, with the Dada Saheb Phalke Award by the president of India.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Firdaus Jahan Sultanpuri, three daughters and a son.</p> <p>\u0095 Majrooh Sultanpuri (Asrar Hasan Khan), lyricist and poet, born October 1 1919; died May 24 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Hindi poet and film lyricist Majrooh Sultanpuri, who has died aged 80, was part of the 1950s golden era that established song as a significant idiom of Indian cinema. He wrote more than 2,000 songs for more than 300 features, and his simple evocations of love, suffering and sacrifice transcended class and the era. He was born Asrar Hasan Khan in Sultanpur, in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. He dabbled with becoming a hafiz (teacher) of the Koran, or a physician. But poetry was his key interest. He adopted his pen name, which meant \"wounded soul of Sultanpur\". He also joined the Communist party of India. It was a chance meeting with film-maker AR Kardar at an assembly of Urdu poets which began his movie career. His first lyrics were for Kardar's Shahjahan (1946). By the 1950s he was working with film-makers like Zia Sarhadi, Bimal Roy and Vijay Anand. His work ranged from the romantic to the funny - and weird. Sultanpuri was the only lyricist of his generation who remained in demand, and kept writing. Some critics charged that he composed songs which were below his best during the last decade, but his rejoinder was that a lyricist had to change with the times. He wrote two major collections of Urdu poetry, and was the first film lyricist to be honoured, in 1993, with the Dada Saheb Phalke Award by the president of India. He is survived by his wife, Firdaus Jahan Sultanpuri, three daughters and a son. \u0095 Majrooh Sultanpuri (Asrar Hasan Khan), lyricist and poet, born October 1 1919; died May 24 2000",

      "body": "<p>Through her radical methods of clay manipulation, the potter Joanna Constantinidis, who has died aged 72, helped to reinvent the \"thrown\" vessel - one formed on the potter's wheel, rather than hand-constructed.</p> <p>The result was a language grounded in a complex appreciation of ceramic history, and informed by the abstract purity of ancient Greek art, and much of the architecture, sculpture and painting produced by the modern movement. Constantinidis distilled and concentrated form. Looking beyond her craft, she produced ceramics that coalesced with the space and spare language of modernism.</p> <p>Born Joanna Connell in York, into a family of Scottish Celtic ancestry, she grew up in Sheffield and was educated at the local grammar school. At home she began to paint and draw, and though art was not on the school curriculum, she recalled the indelible impression made by her headmaster, talking persuasively about Picasso's The Three Musicians. This inspired her, as did the knowledge that her history teacher, Dorothy Kemp, was also a potter, who worked at the Leach pottery at St Ives.</p> <p>In 1946 Constantinidis went to Sheffield College of Art, to study fine art, but she chose pottery for her intermediate exams and became enthralled. She was taught by the fondly-recalled ceramic sculptor HR Stone who, like Dorothy Kemp, was an enthusiast for slipware pottery. Constantinidis began to absorb the few useful texts available at that time, such as Bernard Leach's A Potter's Book. It was, she remembered, a period of trial and error at a time when knowledge was scarce.</p> <p>From 1951 until her retirement in 1989, Constantinidis was a teacher at Chelmsford's technical college. Patient and inspiring, she developed her throwing skills in the spare hours.</p> <p>Her work underwent remarkable changes. Initially she looked at Staffordshire slipware, early saltglaze and industrial wares for ideas, as well as modern oriental potters such as Shoji Hamada. Although her 1950s pots, exhibited at the British Crafts Centre, the Red Rose Guild and the Whitechapel Art Gallery, were distinctly Leach-influenced, Constantinidis had never forgotten the words of Eric Jones, her Sheffield drawing teacher, who had said that \"one can do so much in a single line\". In search of such economy, she became dissatisfied with glazes and decoration and worked towards a language that emphasised form and the material of the clay.</p> <p>Impressed by a series of exhibitions by leading potters Hans Coper and Lucie Rie, held at the Berkeley Galleries in the 1950s, she reformulated her approach, concentrating, as they had, on a few elemental shapes. She focused on tall vessels and bowls, using broad fluting or incised decoration and matt glazes that emphasised the clay's surface. Pots were more \"urban\" in character, and clearly connected with much of the new architecture and design then being produced, though their roots lay in her great admiration for early Mediterranean pots.</p> <p>By the early 1970s, she was altering her shapes through post-wheel modifications - folding and cutting to create unexpected articulations. These objects still preserved the rhythms of throwing, emphasised by the quiet pulse of rings left by the turning wheel. These gently corrugated surfaces, and the asymmetry she could instil in a vessel's profile, contributed to what she called \"latent energy\", a sense of movement preserved in a pot's apparent stasis. By finally eliminating glazes and concentrating on lustres, she could define the \"bone\" of the pot more effectively.</p> <p>Through the 1980s and 1990s, her forms became simpler. Large, open, leaning pots and tall, tapering vessels explored and defined space with a sweeping concision, reminiscent of Richard Serra's steel sculptures or much industrial architecture. Yet, despite her obvious debt to the 20th century landscape, her aesthetic was just as much rooted in the natural world, whether it was the Greece of her husband, writer and film-maker Photis Constantinidis, or the windswept marshes of her beloved Essex coast.</p> <p>Increasingly alone in the last years, she concentrated on stoneware and porcelain in alternation, in the spare functionality of her home near Chelmsford. Though a regular exhibitor, her essential austerity had little interest in self-promotion. Although she made ceramics for use - her porcelain tableware was particularly well designed - she disliked the reductive connotations of \"craft pottery\". She believed strongly that ceramics had sensory values that made it an independent language, going beyond the confines of both art and craft.</p> <p>Very private, Joanna was extremely loyal to her friends, who experienced her self-deprecating wit and sense of fun, and wide cultural knowledge. Though her work was acquired by many public collections, and her contribution was marked by a major touring retrospective in 1995, Joanna felt there was still much to be learned from her material.</p> <p>She recovered sufficiently from a stroke to complete work for a final poignant show at the Crafts Council shop at the Victoria and Albert Museum last May. The pots exhibited were small and simple, but with their resonant lustres and incisive angular forms, were objects of remarkable life - a distillation of 50 years' potting. They were the hallmark of an artist who strove for a structural and material essence, and the result was a highly disciplined and intelligent language that contributed much to modern life.</p> <p>She is survived by her husband.</p> <p>\u0095 Joanna Constantinidis, potter, born December 12 1927; died August 1 2000</p>",

Born Joanna Connell in York, into a family of Scottish Celtic ancestry, she grew up in Sheffield and was educated at the local grammar school. At home she began to paint and draw, and though art was not on the school curriculum, she recalled the indelible impression made by her headmaster, talking persuasively about Picasso's The Three Musicians. This inspired her, as did the knowledge that her history teacher, Dorothy Kemp, was also a potter, who worked at the Leach pottery at St Ives. In 1946 Constantinidis went to Sheffield College of Art, to study fine art, but she chose pottery for her intermediate exams and became enthralled. She was taught by the fondly-recalled ceramic sculptor HR Stone who, like Dorothy Kemp, was an enthusiast for slipware pottery. Constantinidis began to absorb the few useful texts available at that time, such as Bernard Leach's A Potter's Book. It was, she remembered, a period of trial and error at a time when knowledge was scarce. From 1951 until her retirement in 1989, Constantinidis was a teacher at Chelmsford's technical college. Patient and inspiring, she developed her throwing skills in the spare hours. Her work underwent remarkable changes. Initially she looked at Staffordshire slipware, early saltglaze and industrial wares for ideas, as well as modern oriental potters such as Shoji Hamada. Although her 1950s pots, exhibited at the British Crafts Centre, the Red Rose Guild and the Whitechapel Art Gallery, were distinctly Leach-influenced, Constantinidis had never forgotten the words of Eric Jones, her Sheffield drawing teacher, who had said that \"one can do so much in a single line\". In search of such economy, she became dissatisfied with glazes and decoration and worked towards a language that emphasised form and the material of the clay. Impressed by a series of exhibitions by leading potters Hans Coper and Lucie Rie, held at the Berkeley Galleries in the 1950s, she reformulated her approach, concentrating, as they had, on a few elemental shapes. She focused on tall vessels and bowls, using broad fluting or incised decoration and matt glazes that emphasised the clay's surface. Pots were more \"urban\" in character, and clearly connected with much of the new architecture and design then being produced, though their roots lay in her great admiration for early Mediterranean pots. By the early 1970s, she was altering her shapes through post-wheel modifications - folding and cutting to create unexpected articulations. These objects still preserved the rhythms of throwing, emphasised by the quiet pulse of rings left by the turning wheel. These gently corrugated surfaces, and the asymmetry she could instil in a vessel's profile, contributed to what she called \"latent energy\", a sense of movement preserved in a pot's apparent stasis. By finally eliminating glazes and concentrating on lustres, she could define the \"bone\" of the pot more effectively. Through the 1980s and 1990s, her forms became simpler. Large, open, leaning pots and tall, tapering vessels explored and defined space with a sweeping concision, reminiscent of Richard Serra's steel sculptures or much industrial architecture. Yet, despite her obvious debt to the 20th century landscape, her aesthetic was just as much rooted in the natural world, whether it was the Greece of her husband, writer and film-maker Photis Constantinidis, or the windswept marshes of her beloved Essex coast. Increasingly alone in the last years, she concentrated on stoneware and porcelain in alternation, in the spare functionality of her home near Chelmsford. Though a regular exhibitor, her essential austerity had little interest in self-promotion. Although she made ceramics for use - her porcelain tableware was particularly well designed - she disliked the reductive connotations of \"craft pottery\". She believed strongly that ceramics had sensory values that made it an independent language, going beyond the confines of both art and craft. Very private, Joanna was extremely loyal to her friends, who experienced her self-deprecating wit and sense of fun, and wide cultural knowledge. Though her work was acquired by many public collections, and her contribution was marked by a major touring retrospective in 1995, Joanna felt there was still much to be learned from her material. She recovered sufficiently from a stroke to complete work for a final poignant show at the Crafts Council shop at the Victoria and Albert Museum last May. The pots exhibited were small and simple, but with their resonant lustres and incisive angular forms, were objects of remarkable life - a distillation of 50 years' potting. They were the hallmark of an artist who strove for a structural and material essence, and the result was a highly disciplined and intelligent language that contributed much to modern life. She is survived by her husband. \u0095 Joanna Constantinidis, potter, born December 12 1927; died August 1 2000",

      "body": "<p>Peter Preston rightly raises the question of the efficacy of sanctions (Comment, July 31). Anyone who has visited countries subjected to international sanctions will know that a common factor of such isolation is the sense of hopelessness and abandonment that afflicts the ordinary people, who bear the brunt of them. Sanctions only entrench dictators. Normalised relations cannot be established by anything short of revolutionary change and progress is projected into the distant future, usually related to the mortality of the dictators.</p> <p>In any event, we are highly selective about blanket sanctions. Countries such as China are perceived as too important economically and strategically to freeze out. In their case our policy is qualified normalisation. Why not apply the same approach to countries such as Iraq, Iran, Libya and Cuba? Give people hope and you empower them. <br><b>John Stone </b><br> Thames Ditton, Surrey</p> <p>\u0095August 6 will be the 10th anniversary of the imposition of economic sanctions on Iraq. Over the past decade, literally hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children have died as a result of these sanctions. The BBC's John Simpson recently commented that \"if people could hear and see what is being done in their names in Iraq, they would be outraged. But they don't, so it continues\". We agree and fully endorse the protest on August 7 at the Foreign Office. <br><b>Benjamin Zephaniah <br>Caroline Lucas MEP <br>Rowan Williams, <br>Archbishop of Wales <br>and seven others</b><br>Voices in the Wilderness <br><a href=\"mailto:voices@viwuk.freeserve.co.uk\">voices@viwuk.freeserve.co.uk</a></p> <p>\u0095On August 2 1990, Saddam's troops invaded Kuwait and wreaked havoc on our country (Saddam casts long shadow, August 2). Ten years on, Saddam represents as great a threat to the stability of Kuwait as he ever did. His political discourse has not changed. As far as he is concerned, August 2 is still a date to celebrate despite the subsequent misery inflicted on so many people. Saddam continues to deny access to hundreds of Kuwaitis and third-country nationals still unaccounted for. The whole world sympathises with the plight of ordinary Iraqis, except Iraq's own leader. He still refuses to avail himself of UN resolution 1284, which allows him to use the proceeds of oil sales to purchase food and medicines for all his people. Saddam claims he wants to end the suffering of his people. Yet by his own actions, he is ensuring the opposite. <br><b>Khaled Al-Duwaisan </b> <br>Kuwaiti ambassador</p> <p>\u0095In his analysis of the current political situation in Iraq (Targeting the tyrant, August 1), Said Aburish is right to claim that \"on a popular level, the prospects for an uprising are all but non-existent\". He fails, however, to acknowledge the real reason for this. Crushed by 10 years of sanctions which have killed 500,000 children under the age of five and destroyed the country's infrastructure, the Iraqi people are in no state to mount a serious opposition. The sanctions are not just morally corrupt, but strategically redundant. <br><b>Peter Pattisson </b><br>London <br><a href=\"mailto:ppattisson@hotmail.com\">ppattisson@hotmail.com</a></p> <p>\u0095Unicef figures of the mortality rates among the children in Iraq are a complete fabrication by the Iraqi regime. According to a UN report, Iraqi medical expenditure in the last three years totalled only $450m, although resolution 986 allocated $1.32bn every six months. While the humanitarian campaigners' concern over the people of Iraq is appreciated, their ill-informed efforts can equally be damaging. Democratisation of the Middle East won't just happen through wishful thinking.</p> <p>The regime in Iraq crippled the economy by spending its oil wealth on its military ambitions, gassing the Kurds and invading other nations.</p> <p>In 1994 a group of Baghdad merchants who tried to import cheap food in an attempt to lower the market prices were executed. Last year a group of farmers were arrested for their protest against regulations limiting rice planting. Do we really think lifting sanctions is going to help the oppressed? <br><b>Name and address supplied </b></p> <p>\u0095Eighty-four countries are presently under sanctions. But, as Peter Preston points out, success stories are rare, not to say unknown. At last there does seem to be a growing recognition of this. As a member of the Nato parliamentary assembly, I recently attended a seminar in Macedonia on regional security and reconstruction. Speaker after speaker condemned the sanctions on Yugoslavia, which are devastating the whole area.</p> <p>There is little confidence in the chances of success of the stability pact for south-east Europe, which seeks to exclude Yugoslavia. Serbia can't be ignored, it is one of the most important economies of the region. Those who can least cope are hardest hit by sanctions - refugees, children, the sick and elderly. The UN says poverty levels in Serbia almost doubled between July 1998 and September 1999 to 63% of the population.</p> <p>The UN charter envisages sanctions as a means of averting a threat to international peace and security without resorting to military intervention - a means of resolving conflict, not a continuation of war by economic means. It's high time sanctions on Yugoslavia were lifted, so the process of rebuilding civil society can begin. <br><b>Alice Mahon MP</b></p>",

      "bodyText": "Peter Preston rightly raises the question of the efficacy of sanctions (Comment, July 31). Anyone who has visited countries subjected to international sanctions will know that a common factor of such isolation is the sense of hopelessness and abandonment that afflicts the ordinary people, who bear the brunt of them. Sanctions only entrench dictators. Normalised relations cannot be established by anything short of revolutionary change and progress is projected into the distant future, usually related to the mortality of the dictators. In any event, we are highly selective about blanket sanctions. Countries such as China are perceived as too important economically and strategically to freeze out. In their case our policy is qualified normalisation. Why not apply the same approach to countries such as Iraq, Iran, Libya and Cuba? Give people hope and you empower them. John Stone Thames Ditton, Surrey \u0095August 6 will be the 10th anniversary of the imposition of economic sanctions on Iraq. Over the past decade, literally hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children have died as a result of these sanctions. The BBC's John Simpson recently commented that \"if people could hear and see what is being done in their names in Iraq, they would be outraged. But they don't, so it continues\". We agree and fully endorse the protest on August 7 at the Foreign Office. Benjamin Zephaniah Caroline Lucas MEP Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Wales and seven others Voices in the Wilderness voices@viwuk.freeserve.co.uk \u0095On August 2 1990, Saddam's troops invaded Kuwait and wreaked havoc on our country (Saddam casts long shadow, August 2). Ten years on, Saddam represents as great a threat to the stability of Kuwait as he ever did. His political discourse has not changed. As far as he is concerned, August 2 is still a date to celebrate despite the subsequent misery inflicted on so many people. Saddam continues to deny access to hundreds of Kuwaitis and third-country nationals still unaccounted for. The whole world sympathises with the plight of ordinary Iraqis, except Iraq's own leader. He still refuses to avail himself of UN resolution 1284, which allows him to use the proceeds of oil sales to purchase food and medicines for all his people. Saddam claims he wants to end the suffering of his people. Yet by his own actions, he is ensuring the opposite. Khaled Al-Duwaisan Kuwaiti ambassador \u0095In his analysis of the current political situation in Iraq (Targeting the tyrant, August 1), Said Aburish is right to claim that \"on a popular level, the prospects for an uprising are all but non-existent\". He fails, however, to acknowledge the real reason for this. Crushed by 10 years of sanctions which have killed 500,000 children under the age of five and destroyed the country's infrastructure, the Iraqi people are in no state to mount a serious opposition. The sanctions are not just morally corrupt, but strategically redundant. Peter Pattisson London ppattisson@hotmail.com \u0095Unicef figures of the mortality rates among the children in Iraq are a complete fabrication by the Iraqi regime. According to a UN report, Iraqi medical expenditure in the last three years totalled only $450m, although resolution 986 allocated $1.32bn every six months. While the humanitarian campaigners' concern over the people of Iraq is appreciated, their ill-informed efforts can equally be damaging. Democratisation of the Middle East won't just happen through wishful thinking. The regime in Iraq crippled the economy by spending its oil wealth on its military ambitions, gassing the Kurds and invading other nations. In 1994 a group of Baghdad merchants who tried to import cheap food in an attempt to lower the market prices were executed. Last year a group of farmers were arrested for their protest against regulations limiting rice planting. Do we really think lifting sanctions is going to help the oppressed? Name and address supplied \u0095Eighty-four countries are presently under sanctions. But, as Peter Preston points out, success stories are rare, not to say unknown. At last there does seem to be a growing recognition of this. As a member of the Nato parliamentary assembly, I recently attended a seminar in Macedonia on regional security and reconstruction. Speaker after speaker condemned the sanctions on Yugoslavia, which are devastating the whole area. There is little confidence in the chances of success of the stability pact for south-east Europe, which seeks to exclude Yugoslavia. Serbia can't be ignored, it is one of the most important economies of the region. Those who can least cope are hardest hit by sanctions - refugees, children, the sick and elderly. The UN says poverty levels in Serbia almost doubled between July 1998 and September 1999 to 63% of the population. The UN charter envisages sanctions as a means of averting a threat to international peace and security without resorting to military intervention - a means of resolving conflict, not a continuation of war by economic means. It's high time sanctions on Yugoslavia were lifted, so the process of rebuilding civil society can begin. Alice Mahon MP",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>A thread of quite startling naivety runs through the thoughts of the young millionaire businessman Ivan Massow, published yesterday upon his defection from what he called William Hague's \"nasty\" Conservative party. His recantation was absolute - indeed, so much so that the Cabinet Office minister Mo Mowlam, with characteristic directness, was moved to observe upon her surprise and incomprehension at the fact that he hadn't been in the Labour party in the first place.</p> <p>Mr Massow could not have been more candid about the mistakes that he had made in not joining the nice \"new\" Labour party when Tony Blair was elected to lead it in 1994, nor about the misjudgments he now also recognised that he had similarly made about the political principles and pragmatism of Mr Hague. Yet it is nevertheless passingly bizarre that a man who has been on the inside track at Conservative Central Office since the last election, who was a potential runner as the Tory candidate to be the London mayor, who was on the official list of his former party's parliamentary seat-seekers until yesterday and who was apparently a personal and political adviser to the leader himself, could have got things quite so fundamentally wrong.</p> <p>It is perhaps, in its way, a measure of the state of our party politics that this should be so. Defections are not, at present, as unusual as they have been during much of the postwar period. There were a few rightwing Labour MPs who understandably fell off the party bandwagon as it careered to the left in the 70s, and a few leftwing Tories became increasingly uncomfortable with Margaret Thatcher during the 80s, although not many actually left the party. The invention of the short-lived Social Democratic party helped redefine the centre left - and the Liberal party to redefine itself. It is only since the election of Mr Blair, first as Labour leader and then as prime minister, that the centre ground has become increasingly crowded. Mr Massow appears to be the latest victim of a lack of identifiable ideological commitment in either of the two major parties.</p> <p>Even so, he presents himself as a figure of extraordinary political innocence. In his valedictory to the Tory party yesterday, he explained that he was sure, after the election in 1997, that he had made the right decision to stay with them because of Mr Hague's election to replace John Major and because of the new leader's expressions of inclusivity and tolerance. Yet any reading of the newspapers at that time or any conversation with a cross-section of Conservative MPs with a wider experience than Mr Massow of the world at Westminster would surely have told him then that precisely the opposite was the case.</p> <p>In seeking the succession to Mr Major, Mr Hague was not the candidate who represented the ideas of a liberal, consensual Conservative party - nobody ever previously accused him of that. Given the views Mr Massow now expresses, the candidate he should have supported in that election was obviously Kenneth Clarke. Yet in fact it is quite hard to see how, for Mr Massow, anybody could have been an improvement on Mr Major. It would have been almost impossible to have found a single individual in any political party in the United Kingdom in the last century who was more inclusive and tolerant than the outgoing Mr Major. And poor John Major, how he suffered for it, too.</p> <p>Ever since he succeeded to the leadership, Mr Hague has made it perfectly evident that he intended to reposition the Conservative party and he has set about doing exactly this. He has surrounded himself with a group of enthusiastic young advisers - Mr Massow, of course, being one of them - who seemed to know little about the practice of politics and understand less. The word in Tory circles is that Mr Hague actually consults nobody at all. An indication of this was given when a member of the shadow cabinet recently asked a former minister how the principle of collective cabinet responsibility applies in practice if nobody has been involved in any decisions. But Mr Hague's aim, presumably, has been to demonstrate firm leadership and thus establish the distinction between his policies and the wishy-washy, inclusive policies of Mr Major, who had tried so valiantly - and so unsuccessfully - to keep the party united. In pursuit of this objective, however, Mr Hague has been both exclusive and intolerant.</p> <p>The result has been disastrous for the Conservative party, as most Tory MPs miserably concede in private.

      "bodyText": "A thread of quite startling naivety runs through the thoughts of the young millionaire businessman Ivan Massow, published yesterday upon his defection from what he called William Hague's \"nasty\" Conservative party. His recantation was absolute - indeed, so much so that the Cabinet Office minister Mo Mowlam, with characteristic directness, was moved to observe upon her surprise and incomprehension at the fact that he hadn't been in the Labour party in the first place. Mr Massow could not have been more candid about the mistakes that he had made in not joining the nice \"new\" Labour party when Tony Blair was elected to lead it in 1994, nor about the misjudgments he now also recognised that he had similarly made about the political principles and pragmatism of Mr Hague. Yet it is nevertheless passingly bizarre that a man who has been on the inside track at Conservative Central Office since the last election, who was a potential runner as the Tory candidate to be the London mayor, who was on the official list of his former party's parliamentary seat-seekers until yesterday and who was apparently a personal and political adviser to the leader himself, could have got things quite so fundamentally wrong. It is perhaps, in its way, a measure of the state of our party politics that this should be so. Defections are not, at present, as unusual as they have been during much of the postwar period. There were a few rightwing Labour MPs who understandably fell off the party bandwagon as it careered to the left in the 70s, and a few leftwing Tories became increasingly uncomfortable with Margaret Thatcher during the 80s, although not many actually left the party. The invention of the short-lived Social Democratic party helped redefine the centre left - and the Liberal party to redefine itself. It is only since the election of Mr Blair, first as Labour leader and then as prime minister, that the centre ground has become increasingly crowded. Mr Massow appears to be the latest victim of a lack of identifiable ideological commitment in either of the two major parties. Even so, he presents himself as a figure of extraordinary political innocence. In his valedictory to the Tory party yesterday, he explained that he was sure, after the election in 1997, that he had made the right decision to stay with them because of Mr Hague's election to replace John Major and because of the new leader's expressions of inclusivity and tolerance. Yet any reading of the newspapers at that time or any conversation with a cross-section of Conservative MPs with a wider experience than Mr Massow of the world at Westminster would surely have told him then that precisely the opposite was the case. In seeking the succession to Mr Major, Mr Hague was not the candidate who represented the ideas of a liberal, consensual Conservative party - nobody ever previously accused him of that. Given the views Mr Massow now expresses, the candidate he should have supported in that election was obviously Kenneth Clarke. Yet in fact it is quite hard to see how, for Mr Massow, anybody could have been an improvement on Mr Major. It would have been almost impossible to have found a single individual in any political party in the United Kingdom in the last century who was more inclusive and tolerant than the outgoing Mr Major. And poor John Major, how he suffered for it, too. Ever since he succeeded to the leadership, Mr Hague has made it perfectly evident that he intended to reposition the Conservative party and he has set about doing exactly this. He has surrounded himself with a group of enthusiastic young advisers - Mr Massow, of course, being one of them - who seemed to know little about the practice of politics and understand less. The word in Tory circles is that Mr Hague actually consults nobody at all. An indication of this was given when a member of the shadow cabinet recently asked a former minister how the principle of collective cabinet responsibility applies in practice if nobody has been involved in any decisions. But Mr Hague's aim, presumably, has been to demonstrate firm leadership and thus establish the distinction between his policies and the wishy-washy, inclusive policies of Mr Major, who had tried so valiantly - and so unsuccessfully - to keep the party united. In pursuit of this objective, however, Mr Hague has been both exclusive and intolerant. The result has been disastrous for the Conservative party, as most Tory MPs miserably concede in private. It will prove even more so in the months to come. Mr Hague has benefited from the government's difficulties and discomfiture in the past few weeks, but that has not been because of any positive leadership he has shown. He can better the prime minister at Question Time in the House of Commons but, surprisingly enough, that doesn't really seem to matter much any more. A small inroad has been made on Mr Blair's previously invincible poll ratings, but there is little doubt that this has happened because of the government's mistakes and failures rather than the perspicacity of the opposition's policies.

The news surprised and confused US officials, who said it appeared to undermine much of the recent progress made in talks on introducing greater controls on nuclear materials. In a full-page newspaper advertisement the Pakistani commerce ministry has published an application form for the export of 11 radioactive substances, including depleted uranium, enriched uranium, plutonium and tritium, and 17 types of equipment, including nuclear power reactors, nuclear research reactors and reactor control systems. It is the first time Pakistan has openly authorised the sale of nuclear materials since it became the world's newest acknowledged nuclear power in May 1998, when it conducted six bomb tests in direct response to tests in India. Would-be exporters, who have to pay up to \u00a31,400 in application fees, must declare that the sale is for peaceful purposes only and the material will not be re-exported. They must reveal the source of the material or equipment, supply an end-user certificate, and obtain a \"no-objection certificate\" from the government.

High temperatures in the Gulf have a \"significant effect\" on the performance of F3 Tornados, which were designed for cold war air defence operations over the North Sea, said the Commons defence committee. The aircraft, it added, could not fly as high as the US F-15 fighters. \"We understand the frustration of our air crew in undertaking difficult missions with aircraft that are not ideal for the task, particularly when they are operating alongside their US colleagues who have demonstrably superior equipment,\" said the committee. The Ministry of Defence is upgrading the Tornados to give them advanced air to air missiles and enable pilots to identify planes flying nearby through electronic means rather than just on sight. The committee also criticised the accommodation at the RAF's Ali Al Salem airbase in Kuwait, where, it said, personnel were required to live 20 to a room, with 40 having access to only one bathroom with \"inadequate\" air conditioning. The poor telephone system connecting RAF personnel with the UK meant staff lost as much as half their weekly 20 minutes of free calls.

Consultants with covert tobacco links were put in key posts at international health agencies, raising \"serious questions about whether the integrity of WHO decision-making has been compromised\". \"The documents show that tobacco companies sought to divert attention from the public health issues raised by tobacco use, to reduce budgets for the scientific and policy activities carried out by WHO, to pit other UN agencies against the WHO, to convince developing countries that WHO's tobacco control programme was a 'First World' agenda carried out at the expense of the developing world, to distort the results of important scientific studies on tobacco and to discredit WHO as an institution.\" David Davies, vice-president of the EU region of Philip Morris International, said yesterday: \"It is true that we had scientists retained by us to secure information. \"But there is nothing in the document and nothing in the report to suggest there was anything improper that occurred in relation to those activities and certainly nothing which in any sense influenced or undermined the activities of the WHO.\" Mr Davies said that during the late 1980s and early 1990s Philip Morris had paid \"a handful\" of scientists to go to \"ordinary plenary meetings\" of the WHO to which it as a company had been denied access. Mr Davies said those people were known to be working with the tobacco industry. \"I'm aware of one individual who had been a delegate to the WHO. We subsequently entered into arrangements with this person where we assisted in disseminating his views that were critical of the WHO,\" Mr Davies said. He denied that tobacco companies had sought to influence research into smoking, but said a toxicologist working with a joint committee of the WHO and the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) had also worked for a tobacco industry body. \"As I understand it it was not known to a number of people that he had been separately retained by the tobacco industry.\" At the end of the report the experts, led by Thomas Zeltner, the director of Switzerland's public health authority, conclude: \"That top executives of tobacco companies sat together to design and set in motion elaborate strategies to subvert a public health organisation is unacceptable and must be condemned.\" They recommended further investigation in the WHO's 189 member states, including Britain, as well as other UN agencies, including the FAO, because of \"possible clandestine tobacco company influence\" on policies and officials. British American Tobacco said the experts had misrepresented \"the tobacco industry's legitimate lobbying activity\". The WHO adopted rules earlier this year obliging its employees to declare any conflict of interest and has not ruled out further action after the report. Dr Zeltner said: \"The consequences of the tobacco industry's misconduct fall not on global institutions but on people - by undermining tobacco control activities, tobacco companies have increased the toll of lives damaged and lost.\" The WHO estimates that about 4m deaths a year are caused by tobacco, rising to about 10m by 2020.",

With crime costing the country an estimated \u00a350bn a year, the gangs pose a formidable threat to the economy and the justice system. They have started \"networking\" in a way that could make them more difficult to catch, the National Criminal Intelligence Service warned. NCIS said 56% of gangs are involved in drug trafficking and nearly all are money laundering in the report The Threat from Serious and Organised Crime. Yet NCIS found that few solicitors, accountants and estate agents had written \"suspicious transaction reports\". Investigators believe that many professionals turn a blind eye to criminal activity. Rows between rival drug gangs accounted for an estimated 52 murders in the UK last year, the report said. The increase in the number of kidnappings - from 41 in 1998 to 72 last year - was a reflection of the increase in illegal entrant traffic, particularly from the Fujian province in China. Many of those who pay criminals for passage into the UK are either forced into prostitution or imprisoned until their families pay ransom money. While most of the crime gangs in the UK are British, NCIS identified significant activity by criminals from Albania, China, Colombia, the former Soviet Union, south Asia, Turkey, west Africa and the West Indies. Albanian criminals were associated mainly with heroin trafficking, and prostitution. Chinese Triads, primarily the 14K and Wo Shing Wo groups, were linked to illegal immigration. The Colombian cocaine cartels have been focusing particular attention on the UK because users here are prepared to pay up to 20% more for the drug than in other European countries. The report said there were signs that crime gangs are beginning to diversify and collaborate in an unprecedented way. \"Thus, south Asian criminals appear to be involved in a wide spectrum of organised crime, including armed robbery, insurance fraud, credit card fraud, and vehicle theft, as well as crimes with which they were previously associated, such as heroin trafficking and illegal immigration.\" The report added: \"If a greater degree of collaboration occurs between criminals of different ethnicities, it will... make criminals more effective by introducing them to new criminal networks.\" NCIS has compiled intelligence reports on 930 families and gangs working in the UK, though Roger Gaspar, the director of intelligence at NCIS, said they were not all major organisations.

A bus pass costs \u00a340 a month. Often she gets lifts to work with colleagues who also have to commute. Sometimes if she works late, she pays \u00a312 for a taxi. \"Living far from the school is limiting because I am outside a community that I should be a part of,\" she said. Jason Warriner is a staff nurse at Ealing hospital's HIV clinic in west London. At 30, he has seven years' nursing experience and earns \u00a317,000 a year. A one bedroom flat near his hospital costs between \u00a3130,000 and \u00a3200,000. \"I live in a 10ft by 14ft room that I rent for \u00a3294 a month from the hospital accommodation service. \"It contains a single bed, desk, wardrobe, wash basin and a chair. When people come round they have to sit on the bed. Four people on my corridor share a bathroom, but there is no sitting room,\" he said. For the same price, he used to be able to rent a one bedroom flat in Leeds. Ealing hospital accommodation service requires one month's rent in advance, which many nurses are pushed to find. \"I'm trying to save for a deposit on an accommodation service flat,\" Mr Warriner said. \"To do this, I'm working extra shifts in coronary care at night and at weekends.\" \"I always thought that at my age I'd be living in my own house in a decent area. Instead I've got furniture stored all over the country because I can't afford a deposit on a flat. \"But I'm dedicated to my job and I would never give it up.\"",

      "bodyText": "The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, yesterday took a double blow from a hostile parliament, as he suffered the resignation of his foreign minister, David Levy, and a vote granting preliminary approval to new elections. Most observers now believe early elections are inevitable for Mr Barak, whose coalition government is just 15 months old. The parliamentary recess gives him a reprieve until late October but his only chance of survival rests on his ability to reach agreement with his old enemy Yasser Arafat before elections are called. \"Mr Barak now has precious time to try to close a deal with Mr Arafat and to bring it to the Israeli public and call for a general election,\" said Yaron Ezrahi, a fellow of the Israel Democracy Institute and a political science professor at Hebrew University. \"This gives him the opportunity to go to the people over the heads of the parties and the parliament.\" The Israeli prime minister may also try to restart secret talks with Syria. However, Mr Ezrahi warned that the rightwing Likud party could try to wrongfoot Mr Barak by reconvening parliament early to push through the elections bill. Mr Levy's resignation yesterday, in protest at the Israeli prime minister's concessions at Camp David, added to the pressure on the government. After vowing never to divide Jerusalem, whose eastern half has been occupied illegally by Israel since 1967, Mr Barak offered the Palestinians control over some distant neighbourhoods of the city. Mr Levy termed this a betrayal. He was also piqued by Mr Barak's decision to let another minister, Shlomo Ben Ami, lead the negotiations. Mr Ben Ami, and another senior negotiator, Dan Meridor, are among the candidates to replace him as foreign minister. The knesset vote for fresh elections yesterday was won by 61 votes to 51. The bill must pass three further meetings, and could be bottled up in committee. Mr Barak lost another vote earlier this week when the knesset conspired to defeat his choice for Israel's president, Shimon Peres. In the face of his mounting troubles, Mr Barak was undaunted, and promised to astonish Israeli voters by succeeding in the weeks ahead where the 15 days at Camp David failed. \"The elections are much farther away than you think,\" he said. \"We may have three months to try and consolidate either the peace negotiations or the government and this may be the 90 days of the most important period in the present Israeli agenda.\" A more pressing deadline for Mr Barak is September 13, when Mr Arafat is pledged to declare an independent state. The two sides have re-opened low-level negotiations. But Mr Arafat may not be able to make the compromises on Jerusalem and the rights of 3.6m registered Palestinian refugees that the Israelis and Americans are pressing him to. At the weekend, the US president, Bill Clinton, hardened his criticism of Mr Arafat, and threatened to review $400m in US aid to the Palestinians, and consider moving Washington's embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem if he declares a state. Yesterday, Mr Barak told Israeli television that the US could move its embassy by June 20, the day President Clinton leaves office. Mr Ezrahi and others argue that Mr Barak, a highly decorated former army chief, is Mr Arafat's best hope for a just peace, and that future Israeli leaders will not be able to offer as much to the Palestinians. However, it is far from certain that Mr Arafat can be frogmarched towards a deal, especially one that would involve concessions that his people, and the Muslim world at large, would find impossible to stomach. \"Arafat does not really have much room to manoeuvre,\" said Khalil Shikaki, a Palestinian analyst. \"It is not just Jerusalem, but more general, and it does not look like Arafat is finding public opinion pushing him towards a compromise.\"",

The widespread support for the strike called by Zimbabwe's trade union confederation, and backed by the main political opposition party and farmers, was a further demonstration of disillusionment with the government a day after a one-third devaluation of the national currency.

It looks as though it's about to rain. </p> <p>\"Mmm, yes,\" says Jihanti carefully, \"but to be fair, Colin was exhausted, we'd been filming him for days.\" It's the culmination of a series of scenes which show a petulant, increasingly impotent figure. Tennant is an exotic creature, familiar to many for his friendship with Princess Margaret and a lifetime's worth of gossip column appearances, but Jihanti - the Oscar-winning producer of When We Were Kings, his documentary about Muhammad Ali's mid-70s Rumble In The Jungle - and Bullman did not set out to make a film about him. </p> <p>Commissioned by Channel 4 to contribute to the Caribbean Summer series, they headed for the islands to find themselves a story. An initial visit to Mustique yielded little of interest, but returning to St Vincent, they spotted an intriguing-looking elderly white man, tall and clad in flowing robes and high hat. \"Do you think that might be Tennant?\" asked Bullman. One direct approach from Jihanti, which established the answer to be yes, and they were hooked. </p> <p>\"When we'd been in Mustique, everyone had talked about Colin, even though he hasn't lived there for years\", explains Jihanti. Tennant bought the entire island, three miles long and a mile wide, in 1958 as a wedding gift for his wife. It cost him \u00a345,000. Alan Whicker made an oleaginous programme about Mustique in 1970, celebrating its A-list celebrity pulling power, as the likes of Mick Jagger and David Bowie came there to party. But by the mid 70s Tennant was gone, forced to sell up by financial necessity. He has rarely been back since, so for the film-makers to persuade him to revisit the island with them was something of a coup. </p> <p>\"Colin told us about the Whicker documentary, and was obviously hoping we'd make something similar\", says Jihanti. If so, his hopes were in vain. The film benefits hugely from the inclusion of mischievous out-takes - Tennant demanding that he be allowed to shoot links again, and maligning his perceived tormentors. Of some local labourers he says, \"They're all so frightfully slow and stupid.\" His biographer, a hapless figure called Nicholas Courtney, is screeched at for wanting to hog the limelight and told to get out of camera-shot, while a polite American couple, house-owners on Mustique, are labelled \"social-climbing worms\". Tennant himself is profoundly class-conscious, and Princess Margaret is just about the only person in the film to get unbroken charm from him. \"And Patrick Lichfield,\" notes Jihanti drily, \"after all, he's an Earl, so he's more grand than Colin. I'm an American, but if you spend time with Colin you soon get to know your Debrett's Peerage.\" </p> <p>The chief purpose of Tennant's trip to Mustique is to set up his own tent and entertain Princess Margaret to lunch in front of the cameras. To be allowed to do this, he must be granted permission by the private island's central bookings service to pitch his tent - a state of affairs he clearly has difficulty accepting as anything other than a great impertinence. By contrast, in a scene where native islanders hold a church service to thank him for all that he has done for Mustique in the past, Tennant radiates goodwill, safely back in his preferred role of gracious patriarch. Jihanti says that he sees parallels with Tennant, unwanted on Mustique, and the exiled King Lear. As Tennant flaps around in his white robes, berating all and sundry in fluting, Brian Sewell-esque tones, the comparison doesn't seem too fanciful. </p> <p>When Tennant achieves his aim of receiving Princess Margaret in his lavishly appointed tent, the film-makers gain remarkable access to a member of the royal family at a private event. Confronted by the vivid Kamasutra-style illustrations with which Tennant has decorated the walls, HRH can do little except express her astonishment, while Tennant valiantly fills in all the gaps in the conversation. Jihanti sees this sequence as evidence of his subject's sense of humour. \"All the negatives about Colin are on screen,\" he concedes, \"but there's so much more to him than that. He agreed to the film because he's desperate to prove that he's not just a fool who squandered his inheritance and threw away the greatest investment - Mustique - of his life.\" </p> <p>Despite his sympathy for Tennant, Jihanti is aware that, with its bizarre cast of British nobles, The Man Who Bought Mustique can most easily be read as an argument for republicanism. The film is a character study of an British aristocrat struggling - and failing - to adapt to the changing world around him. Its idyllic Caribbean setting is almost irrelevant. What's fascinating are the flaws of the man revealed on screen. Jihanti and Bullman have accomplished the unusual feat of capturing a living, breathing dinosaur on film. </p> <p>The Man Who Bought Mustique, tonight, 9pm, Channel 4.</p>",

What's fascinating are the flaws of the man revealed on screen. Jihanti and Bullman have accomplished the unusual feat of capturing a living, breathing dinosaur on film. The Man Who Bought Mustique, tonight, 9pm, Channel 4.",

      "body": "<p>It has been a mixed week for the male sexual organ. The penises of heterosexual men, it has been reported, contracted 31% more gonorrhoea last year than they had the year before, with young men particularly at risk. It has also been shown that the fertility of older men, as we always suspected, declines with age - 15% of men over 35 take more than a year to make their partners pregnant, say research teams from Bristol and Brunel universities. And according to Spice Girl Mel C, the former children's television presenter Jamie Theakston, who now presents Top of the Pops, has got \"the biggest cock in the business\".</p> <p>On Tuesday, newspapers speculated about the rise in sexually transmitted diseases, about why the young men were taking such risks. Why these guys were plunging in, without making the effort to protect themselves with condoms. Kevin Fenton, a consultant epidemiologist, noted: \"Young people are particularly vulnerable, as many are unaware of sexually transmitted diseases and their symptoms.\"</p> <p>The lessening of fear of Aids is, of course, a factor. \"We can't lose vigilance,\" Fenton says. But vigilance is, in some ways, increasing. On Wednesday, a tabloid reported that the comedian Mark Lamarr, who had been seen emerging from Tara Palmer-Tomkinson's hotel room, \"has got a bit of a 'Theakston' on his hands - or rather Tara's hands\".</p> <p>What do I know about the penises of famous people? Quite a lot, it turns out. Theakston's was last week reported by an ex-girlfriend to be small, but apparently it has grown. Lamarr's \"isn't in the same ballpark\" (the Sun) as that of Tara Palmer-Tomkinson's previous boyfriend, Michael \"Skinny\" Power. Errol Flynn's was big but not as big as he tried to make out. That of poor Keith Chegwin, who recently stripped for a nudist gameshow on Channel 5, is not big but might be bigger than other people have tried to make out.</p> <p>The question is: why do I know all this stuff? I know it because, as censorship recedes, we find ourselves being free to talk about male sexual organs - not just between ourselves, as we did in Errol Flynn's time, but in national newspapers and on television. Not just in a general sense but in a personal sense. Again, poor Keith Chegwin. In cultural terms, another borderline is being crossed.</p> <p>This, of course - another layer of prudishness being stripped away, another set of taboos being dumped - is a good thing. It is also hilarious. Penises are great things to joke about. Did you see the episode of Seinfeld in which Jason Alexander goes swimming in cold water? As he's slipping out of his trunks, the woman he fancies opens the door. He is horrified. Shaken, he asks Jerry the question: \"Do women understand about shrinkage?\"</p> <p>Men don't mind - they can take it. Men like to laugh at themselves. The American comedian Drew Carey tells penis jokes. \"My dick is so big,\" he says, \"it's got an opening act.\"</p> <p>The penis can be laughed at because, as we can see from the gonorrhoea figures, it is a predatory organ. The penis does not belong to a minority group. It is a vector of misery; it can be an agent of damage and shame. We are comfortable when we see a television advert in which a French model holds a tape-measure to her crotch and says: \"Size matters.\" We laugh - and we snigger again when the man in the ad says, rather pathetically: \"It's what you do with it that counts.\"</p> <p>What are we supposed to do with it? As a boy, I knew what I had to do - I had to score. My sexual desire would only be acceptable, in the fullest sense, when I had properly consummated it, when I had gone through the proper channels. As a male in our culture, I learned that to have sexual desire that is not sanctified in this way, by actually having sex with an actual woman, was demeaning. It was unbecoming.</p> <p>How did I feel? I felt like the 15,572 guys who contracted gonorrhoea in 1999. It's not that I hated condoms, it's that I didn't give them very much thought. Venereal disease and pregnancy seemed like distant consequences of having risky sex, in the same way that champagne poisoning might seem like a distant consequence of winning the lottery. It doesn't stop you entering the draw.</p> <p>No wonder we make fun of male sexual organs. And no wonder their female counterparts are celebrated. I was reading an article in Cosmopolitan's Real Life Stories, in which women talked about their sexual exploits. One woman said: \"Some of the best orgasms I've had were with a camel!\" It was the movement of the \"magnificent beast\" beneath her crotch that did it. \"I decided to use the shower head as a vibrator,\" said another. These were not women who had failed to score but women who had succeeded in being self-sufficient. Can you imagine what we'd say to men who talked in a similar vein? We'd laugh at them, the wankers.</p> <p>We may have equality of the sexes but we do not have equality of sexual organs. One cannot imagine an ad in which a guy smugly purrs \"Firmness counts\" or \"Tightness matters\". This would definitely be below the belt.</p> <p>Female sexual organs carry a powerful taboo. I can print the words prick, cock and dick as much as I like but I know I have to be careful with the c-word. I can smirk at an ad in which a man compares himself with another man in a urinal but there is, of course, no female equivalent. When Gore Vidal reported Cecil Beaton's remark to Greta Garbo that, with age, his genitals were becoming smaller, and Garbo's sad reply: \"I wish that I could say the same,\" it was her words that seemed the more shocking - or, in any case, the less palatable.</p> <p>Is our inequality when it comes to sexual organs a good thing? Not necessarily. It's a phase we're going through. We laugh at male organs because we truly believe they are, in general, less vulnerable than female ones. But men - heterosexual men, at least - still define themselves, still seek their identity, in phallic terms; they still feel the need to score. This is why they catch gonorrhoea; this is why city traders talk about \"getting your cock in the custard\" when they are making a risky trade. This is why, even if men feel the ticking of the biological clock, they won't feel it in the same way as women. This is why Drew Carey says: \"My dick is so big it's got a dick of its own! And even my dick's dick is bigger than your dick.\"</p>",

Signalling the start of a long hot autumn when Brussels returns from its normally sleepy summer break, the European Civil Service Federation (FFPE) said yesterday that it would pursue its complaint to the court of justice if necessary. Commission employees are up in arms over Mr Prodi's decision to appoint his former spokesman, Ricardo Levi, to run a directorate dealing with forward planning. Tensions are already mounting over far-reaching internal reform plans being overseen by Neil Kinnock, Mr Prodi's British deputy. Mr Levi, a journalist and long-time confidant of the former Italian prime minister, performed badly during his stint in the hot seat and was replaced by a professional British eurocrat who it is hoped will prove a more effective spin doctor. Commission officials insisted yesterday that proper procedures were followed, but the union complained that the Levi appointment \"flies in the face of Mr Prodi's own undertakings and seriously undermines the credibility of civil service structures\". Privately, some commission officials call the six staff unions \"dinosaurs\" bent on disrupting work and inflating their membership figures, said to constitute no more than 20% of the 18,500 employees. The FFPE noted that Mr Prodi was appointed after the mass resignation of Jacques Santer's commission. It claimed that Mr Levi's appointment was made without the advertisement of a detailed job description or proper interviews. This was \"illegal and flies in the face of the very rules drawn up by the commission\", the union said. The move comes against a background of unhappiness over Mr Kinnock's reform plans, aimed at creating what he has called the \"best multinational administration in the world\". The former Labour party leader said last week that his plans were making progress, with new financial management rules in place and an unprecedented bid for extra staff. Critics argue that his main achievement so far has been in avoiding industrial action, and trouble is possible in the autumn when management and staff start discussing core personnel and career issues. Staff also complained at the decision to close the notorious Economat food shop, long a symbol of a \"fat cat\" lifestyle in the Eurosceptic media. Mr Prodi has had a rocky ride since taking over from Mr Santer last September, and the union action seems likely to cast a shadow over his first anniversary next month. The weakness of the commission has allowed the EU's big governments, especially France and Germany, to ignore it, even as the European parliament has seemed to be stronger since playing a high-profile role in Mr Santer's dramatic downfall.",

But three weeks ago a few dozen white farmers hit back against the government and went on strike.</p> <p>Even before their protest culminated in yesterday's widely respected nationwide general strike to demand the restoration of the rule of law, many farmers had cause for regret. Robert Mugabe responded to the defiance in his favoured manner - he focussed his ire on the whites and greatly raised the stakes.</p> <p>The government's announcement that it will now seize about two-thirds of all white-owned farmland threatens to bring Zimbabwe's burgeoning crisis to a head within weeks.</p> <p>Just a few days ago, Zimbabweans were debating whether Mr Mugabe would run for another term as president in two years or step aside for a younger candidate in the hope of reviving Zanu-PF's popularity. Now the debate is over whether Zimbabwe's economy can survive Mr Mugabe's rule, however short it might be.</p> <p>The original core of a few dozen white farmers went on strike last month in protest at the continued occupation of their land by \"war veterans\" and escalating violence.

      "bodyText": "Perhaps it was desperation at the continued harassment, or perhaps it was a misplaced confidence after the stinging rebuke Zimbabwe's voters delivered to their desperate president. But three weeks ago a few dozen white farmers hit back against the government and went on strike. Even before their protest culminated in yesterday's widely respected nationwide general strike to demand the restoration of the rule of law, many farmers had cause for regret. Robert Mugabe responded to the defiance in his favoured manner - he focussed his ire on the whites and greatly raised the stakes. The government's announcement that it will now seize about two-thirds of all white-owned farmland threatens to bring Zimbabwe's burgeoning crisis to a head within weeks. Just a few days ago, Zimbabweans were debating whether Mr Mugabe would run for another term as president in two years or step aside for a younger candidate in the hope of reviving Zanu-PF's popularity. Now the debate is over whether Zimbabwe's economy can survive Mr Mugabe's rule, however short it might be. The original core of a few dozen white farmers went on strike last month in protest at the continued occupation of their land by \"war veterans\" and escalating violence. Even the government said the occupations should stop in favour of a more orderly distribution. Dozens of other farmers across the country joined the protest which forced the hand of the unions and the main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change. They were not only bound to support the strike but had to be seen to organise it. But the evident role of whites in promoting the protest further angered Mr Mugabe, whose government hit back by quadrupling the number of farms facing confiscation to 3,000. While the farm seizures might strengthen Mr Mugabe's political control in the short term, ultimately they look disastrous for his country's economy and damaging for the government. The earmarked land produces a good proportion of the country's agricultural exports. Tobacco earned Zimbabwe about \u00a3250m last year but revenues are expected to drop by at least one-fifth this year. Manufacturers are warning of large scale redundancies. Already there is talk of a looming food shortage. Neither will the chaos of the land distribution help Mr Mugabe. Whether there are 500,000 families who want to move, as the government says, is a moot point. While Zimbabwean farms are large - the 3,000 earmarked for redistribution cover nearly 20,000 square miles - much of the land is of poor quality or barren. If the farms are subdivided into hundreds of thousands of small plots, some are going to be left with the scraps. And, although the recent changes to the constitution permit the confiscation of farms without compensation, there is still an established process of notification and appeal to be followed. The government has already completed the procedure for the original 804 farms but if, as it says, it wants to seize the additional land before the rains in a few weeks it will have to ride roughshod over its own regulations and defy the courts.",

      "bodyText": "US scientists have deciphered the entire genetic makeup of the cholera microbe - one of humanity's cruellest enemies. The research could trigger drugs or vaccines to control the disease which can kill its victim in a day. The genetic sequence was unravelled by the Institute for Genomic Research, a non-profit laboratory in Maryland founded by the scientist and entrepreneur Craig Venter and headed by his wife, Claire Fraser. The microbe Vibrio cholerae has two chromosomes with a total of 3,885 genes, spelled out in more than 4m letters of DNA. It has been a scourge in south Asia for at least 1,000 years, but moved worldwide in 1817, in the first of a series of seven pandemics. Strains of the bacterium live harmlessly in brackish estuaries and coastal waters; some infect fish and shellfish while others are dangerous to humans. In refugee camps, city slums and places where sanitation is poor, cholera can kill up to half of its victims. Cholera joins other dangerous microbes - including tuberculosis, meningitis and syphilis in having been sequenced.",

      "bodyText": "A senior minister in Germany yesterday said that the time had come to consider banning extreme rightwing parties in the country. The environment minister, J\u00fcrgen Trittin, made his proposal amid a rapidly growing crusade by the government against the far right. The campaign was given huge additional impetus last Thursday when a bomb, thought to have been planted by ultra rightwingers, exploded at a D\u00fcsseldorf railway station injuring nine immigrants, including six Jews. Mr Trittin's remarks nevertheless planted the seeds of a potentially troublesome crop for the government. The only parties that can be outlawed in Germany are those proved to be undermining the constitution. A ban would need to be reviewed by the constitutional court and the process of scrutiny could take years. Doubts were also expressed about the effectiveness of such a ban, even if it were approved. The interior minister of Germany's most populous region, North Rhine-Westphalia, said that when the authorities there outlawed a far-right group, it only succeeded in driving it underground and making surveillance of its members more difficult. \"It actually led to the opposite of what we wanted,\" said Fritz Behrens.

Pension reform is the key political issue on Mr Schr\u00f6der's autumn agenda. The other factor prompting official concern is the prospect of EU enlargement to the east, which could bring large numbers of Poles, Czechs and Hungarians into Germany. They risk encountering a level of xenophobia which prompted Wolfgang Thierse, the speaker of the lower house of the German parliament, to say at the weekend: \"I am ashamed of this country.\" Statistics point to a level of anti-immigrant violence proportionately similar to that in Britain. The daily Frankfurter Allegemeine Zeitung yesterday quoted police and security officials as saying that more than 30 people had been killed by rightwing extremists in the past 10 years - in a country of some 80m. The Home Office in London said that in the four years from 1996 to 1999, there were 10 reported racially motivated homicides, in a country with a population less than three-quarters the size of Germany's. The problem is that Germany's far-right violence is overwhelmingly concentrated in the economically depressed east, which was under communist rule and, until the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, had an uninterrupted experience of dictatorship stretching back to the foundation of the Third Reich. There was far less re-examination of the Nazi past in the east than in the capitalist west. A report issued earlier this year by the BVD, Germany's equivalent of MI5, showed that the five regions with the highest incidence of suspected or proven rightwing violence were all in east Germany.

      "body": "<p>I could be making my name on the internet right now. All I need is a bright idea and I can live the Great Internet Dream - that my startup website becomes the best in the field and millions will surf a path to my door. Kudos, fame, interviews in Time magazine, profiles in the FT... all around the corner, just as soon as I have a brilliant idea. </p> <p>While awaiting inspiration, I had a look for other sites that have done the same. There are quite a few. Although the corporate giants such as Microsoft, the BBC, CNN and AOL Time Warner have a massive web presence, some of the smaller non-profit sites have the reputation that is infinitely more powerful on the net. </p> <p>Best known is the <a href=\"http://www.drudgereport.com\">Drudge Report</a>, which reached international prominence when it broke the story of President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky. Matt Drudge started by relaying anonymous Hollywood gossip, and, as his reputation and contacts list grew, he moved into all types of news - his was the first US news source to publish the story of Princess Diana's death. It is unpleasant to read and often strident, but it does get the news out. </p> <p>Many other sites have achieved success in the same way, although not to the same government-shaking extent. <a href=\"http://www.aintitcool.com\" target=\"_new\">Ain't It Cool News</a> is simply one person's website consisting mainly of film reviews not very well presented - but, like the Drudge Report, it has access. Its reputation has brought it prominence in a continual virtuous circle. The more people you reach, the more people contribute rumours, gossip, reviews or whatever to your site; as your site gets better content, its reputation grows and more people visit.

All I need is a bright idea and I can live the Great Internet Dream - that my startup website becomes the best in the field and millions will surf a path to my door. Kudos, fame, interviews in Time magazine, profiles in the FT... all around the corner, just as soon as I have a brilliant idea. While awaiting inspiration, I had a look for other sites that have done the same. There are quite a few. Although the corporate giants such as Microsoft, the BBC, CNN and AOL Time Warner have a massive web presence, some of the smaller non-profit sites have the reputation that is infinitely more powerful on the net. Best known is the Drudge Report, which reached international prominence when it broke the story of President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky. Matt Drudge started by relaying anonymous Hollywood gossip, and, as his reputation and contacts list grew, he moved into all types of news - his was the first US news source to publish the story of Princess Diana's death. It is unpleasant to read and often strident, but it does get the news out. Many other sites have achieved success in the same way, although not to the same government-shaking extent. Ain't It Cool News is simply one person's website consisting mainly of film reviews not very well presented - but, like the Drudge Report, it has access. Its reputation has brought it prominence in a continual virtuous circle. The more people you reach, the more people contribute rumours, gossip, reviews or whatever to your site; as your site gets better content, its reputation grows and more people visit. Reputation is all: David Lisk of Northern Ireland has, for some reason, built an amateur list at www.airdisasters.co.uk of every civilian air crash in history.

He is arguably the man who laid the foundations for 20th century science; he was also a mountaineer, an agnostic who envied the religious, a railroad engineer turned socialite, and the man who answered that most fundamental question: why is the sky blue? </p> <p>\"He touched on everything. He was the centre of English science - he sent British science off on a new road and made it great,\" says Professor John Lienhard, of the University of Houston in Texas, who has made Tyndall his hero. It is precisely because Tyndall set up British science, rather than concentrated on one invention or one theory, that he is relatively unknown today. \"A lot of people travelled on his back,\" adds Lienhard, \"We've capitalised on his work.\" </p> <p>Tyndall was born in 1820 in the village of Leighlinbridge in southern Ireland. He started as a railroad engineer and ended up studying for a doctorate in Berlin and teaching at the Royal Institute in London. While he was in London in 1859, he took the first steps towards understanding why the sky is blue. He shone a white light through a tank of water mixed with a little milk. The particles of milk deflected the light so that from the side the light emerging looked blue. </p> <p>We now know that the sky is blue because molecules in the air scatter blue light from the sun more than they scatter red light. Tyndall thought dust or droplets of water in the atmosphere were responsible for blue skies, but scientists subsequently realised that this would mean there would be a greater variation in the colour of the sky depending on the weather conditions than there is. </p> <p>Although the sky undoubtedly changes colour, the amount of oxygen and nitrogen in the air is sufficient to scatter blue light far more than red light. It was Einstein who in 1911 calculated the exact formula for light scattering by molecules. Tyndall went on to build a number of instruments that became the basis for light measuring equipment, such as violet spectrometers, which we use today. </p> <p>He invented the first device that used infra-red to measure atmospheric pollution in the London smog, and he made a light pipe which, with some modification, is now the endoscope, allowing doctors to examine a patient's insides without surgery. This study of light led to his theory on germs. He wanted to create a box for his light experiments which was dust-free and ended up proving that bacteria are responsible for disease. </p> <p>At the time doctors knew that dirt and dust caused disease, and that germs might be the major agents. Tyndall put these ideas together when he realised that by creating a box of clean air, he had removed the germs. He proved that keeping meat, fish, vegetables and urine in sterile air kept them free from rot whereas the same materials left outside quickly became contaminated by bacteria. </p> <p>Tyndall worked on sound, discovering that he could measure pitch and tone quality by using fire; at one point he read a poem by Spenser to a naked flame, watching how it danced to different vowel sounds. He brought his wide ranging intellect to bear on spiritual matters; he tried to analyse the right conditions for a miracle to occur or when a prayer might be answered; he wrote about cosmology and creation. </p> <p>In 1868 he described the planchette, a heart shaped plate on rollers which held a pencil. When two people place their fingers on either side, the planchette moves and allegedly writes out spirit messages; at the time this was an American obsession. Tyndall and his friend, Michael Faraday, offered to study the planchette objectively, but received neither help nor encouragement from those who made the greatest claims for spirit writing. </p> <p>According to Lienhard, the subtext for this work was that Faraday was intensely religious and the agnostic Tyndall was not a little envious. He wrote that Faraday \"drinks from a fount on Sunday which refreshes his soul for a week.\" </p> <p>Lienhard stresses that Tyndall's greatest contribution was bringing a new way of thinking to British science: \"He was the conduit by which the romantic poets were heard in science. He was a romantic thinker, he discovered nature by dreaming nature.\" This, after all, is the man who wrote: \"Thus having exhausted science and reached its very rim, the real mystery of existence still looms around us. And thus it will ever loom - ever beyond the bourne of man's intellect - giving the poets of successive ages just occasion to declare that, We are such stuff/ As dreams are made on, and our little life/ Is rounded with a sleep.\" </p> <p>Lienhard adds: \"Tyndall is far more important that he's cracked up to be, but don't be too literal - you'll miss him, he'll slip by you. You shrink him if you reduce him to a set of specific contributions. He's embedded in the subtleties.\" </p> <p>Tyndall, who in this age of unsubtlety, might escape with his genius intact, was a keen mountaineer. He was the first to climb the Weisshorn, and would have been the first to climb the Matterhorn but his guides refused to traverse the highest peak in 1862. The penultimate peak and the ridge which stretches from it to the final peak were named after him; a tribute to a man who helped finesse British science, but whose name rarely ranks among the great and the good.</p>",

Most people are in danger of getting sick. For those already weak, or ill, or under stress, this sickness is considered one of the vilest.

In one day, a bad case can void 20 litres of water. This is dehydration at a catastrophic level. One healthy adult human male contains only about 44 litres of water altogether, between and inside his trillions of cells, so the sufferer can lose half of his bodyweight in a day, and the suffering is commensurate. </p> <p>As the dehydration reaches a critical stage, agonising cramps set, in, convulsing all the muscles in the body and causing the victims to writhe with pain.

Some might fall into a death-like coma. \"Among the common people of England,\" says Sheldon Watts in his study Epidemics And History (Yale, 1997) \"the fear that carrion removal squads would haul one off while still alive was matched only by the anxiety about who the cholera would alight on next.\" </p> <p>A team led by Claire Fraser, of the Institute for Genomic Research in Maryland, reports in Nature today that it has completed the entire DNA sequence of Vibrio cholerae.

Yet for most of human history, most people had never heard of, and never experienced it. It was probably endemic in India, but it first ventured beyond the subcontinent in 1817.

In 1829 it hit Europe, causing 7,000 deaths in Paris, and 4,000 in London. Migrating Irish carried to America and Canada, and from there it moved to Cuba. Altogether, cholera has swept around the globe in seven great pandemics. The last began in 1961, and continues. From the start, cholera puzzled what passed then for a medical profession because nobody could work out why some streets or villages were stricken, why some were unscathed; why some people were not touched, and others folded like limp rags. </p> <p>Some suggested that certain classes or physiques were more at risk than others; some calculated that contagion might play a role, and set up quarantine regimes. But it was not until 1854 that a London physician, John Snow - he gave chloroform to Queen Victoria to help her in childbirth, and collaborated with Florence Nightingale - cracked the mystery and helped found a new science called epidemiology. </p> <p>Snow studied the pattern of illnesses in London during an epidemic in 1848-49 and built up a careful map of cases street by street then arrived at the answer by logic: one group who had died of cholera had all used water from a particular pump in Broad Street (now Broadwick Street in Soho). The people nearby who drank beer did not get cholera: ergo, contaminated water spread the disease. </p> <p>He mapped death rates from cholera against housing values and water supply companies over dozens of London districts: typically, deaths in well-heeled Hampstead or St James's, Westminster were far fewer than in the hovels of Rotherhithe and the stews of Islington. This too, matched other observations: healthy, well-nourished people tended to have immune systems that permitted recovery. </p> <p>But as the Red Cross and Red Crescent workers know too well, exhausted, half-starved, distressed and desperate people are easy prey to cholera. Although Snow's work now looks incontrovertible, many still argued that cholera was airborne, rather than waterborne. The confirmation of an actual agent, a bacillus, came from the great Prussian biologist Robert Koch, who began the hunt for the killer in Cairo and completed it in Calcutta, in 1883, where he found it in the water supply. There were always a few deaths from cholera at any time, around the waters of the lower Ganges. After a famine, however, cholera mortality would skyrocket. </p> <p>One recent outbreak of cholera in the Americas, ironically, grew out of worries about the possible carcinogenic effects of chlorinated water.

      "body": "<p><strong> Any favourite websites?</strong> The <a href=\"http://www.ft.com\">Financial Times</a> is one, as is <a href=\"http://www.tornadoinsider.com\">Tornado Insider</a>. I also go to <a href=\"http://www.redherring.com\">Red Herring</a> for all the latest on the industry. </p> <p><strong> Are you happy with the way the net is regulating itself?</strong> It's still pretty anarchic and there are still a lot of poor sites, useless information and anyone can pretty much do what they like. So I think I would like to see a bit more regulation. I also see taxation ahead, although it will be very difficult for governments to work out a successful way of taxing the net. </p> <p><strong> Are any of the new platforms having any impact?</strong> I don't think that Wap (wireless application protocol) has had a terrific impact yet but it's all set to be the most significant platform for accessing the net over the next year. I think it needs a more advanced distribution system. GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) will make a tremendous difference, as will third generation technologies when you'll be able to transmit video images to a mobile phone screen. </p> <p><strong> Is e-commerce having any effect on conventional commerce?</strong> I think it's denting it very slightly in certain areas. Even though e-commerce revenues are set to quadruple in Europe over the next three to four years, more than 50% of net users in the UK still do not buy anything online! Surprisingly, the biggest area for online shopping is groceries and women, who are the biggest online shoppers for groceries, but comprise a fairly small proportion of internet users </p> <p><strong> Where do you see e-commerce going?</strong> I think it's clearly growing in certain areas like travel, computer software and hardware, videos and CDs but there will be fewer players. The larger retailers and high street brand names will continue to do well offline but they will do better than the pure play internet brands as and when they decide to go online. They'll have a much better-known and trusted brand. </p> <p><strong> Do we suffer from too much information?</strong> Many of the online news and information sites are not always very focused. It's often not very clear what they're offering, for whom and why. </p> <p><strong> Are you a fan of gadgets?</strong> No, not really. However, I am technically literate. </p> <p><strong> Is the internet community any less prone to sexism?</strong> I think the problem starts when many women feel that the internet is about IT, which it isn't. I commented some time back that I do not receive enough requests for investment from women. Many women maybe don't have enough confidence to submit a business plan but also feel they have to have an understanding of technical issues or technical skills which they absolutely don't need to have. All they have to be able to do is articulate what they would like the customers to do on the site, what services they'd like to provide and what options they'd like to give. A systems development company would then help them put it all together. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Any favourite websites? The Financial Times is one, as is Tornado Insider. I also go to Red Herring for all the latest on the industry. Are you happy with the way the net is regulating itself? It's still pretty anarchic and there are still a lot of poor sites, useless information and anyone can pretty much do what they like. So I think I would like to see a bit more regulation. I also see taxation ahead, although it will be very difficult for governments to work out a successful way of taxing the net. Are any of the new platforms having any impact? I don't think that Wap (wireless application protocol) has had a terrific impact yet but it's all set to be the most significant platform for accessing the net over the next year. I think it needs a more advanced distribution system. GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) will make a tremendous difference, as will third generation technologies when you'll be able to transmit video images to a mobile phone screen. Is e-commerce having any effect on conventional commerce? I think it's denting it very slightly in certain areas. Even though e-commerce revenues are set to quadruple in Europe over the next three to four years, more than 50% of net users in the UK still do not buy anything online! Surprisingly, the biggest area for online shopping is groceries and women, who are the biggest online shoppers for groceries, but comprise a fairly small proportion of internet users Where do you see e-commerce going? I think it's clearly growing in certain areas like travel, computer software and hardware, videos and CDs but there will be fewer players. The larger retailers and high street brand names will continue to do well offline but they will do better than the pure play internet brands as and when they decide to go online. They'll have a much better-known and trusted brand. Do we suffer from too much information? Many of the online news and information sites are not always very focused. It's often not very clear what they're offering, for whom and why. Are you a fan of gadgets? No, not really. However, I am technically literate. Is the internet community any less prone to sexism? I think the problem starts when many women feel that the internet is about IT, which it isn't. I commented some time back that I do not receive enough requests for investment from women. Many women maybe don't have enough confidence to submit a business plan but also feel they have to have an understanding of technical issues or technical skills which they absolutely don't need to have. All they have to be able to do is articulate what they would like the customers to do on the site, what services they'd like to provide and what options they'd like to give. A systems development company would then help them put it all together.",

Following his father, he became an engineer, before winning a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music from 1947-51. He studied composition with William Alwyn and piano with Harold Craxton, while also taking a BMus at London University. His Op. 1, a set of variations for string orchestra, dates from 1949. </p> <p>Prizes, awards and recognition then came very quickly, including the Royal Philharmonic Society Prize for his Clarinet Concerto and the Koussevitsky Foundation Award for his Second Symphony. </p> <p>A steady flow of works continued throughout the early 1950s - a Violin Concerto, a Bartholomew Fair overture, and a set of Symphonic Variations. Chamber music included a Viola Sonata, a Piano Sonata and a Piano Trio commissioned by the Dartington Summer School of Music, and first performed there in August 1956, with the late Sir William Glock at the piano. A group of vocal works included The Fray of Suport for chorus, a barbaric tour de force well worth revival. </p> <p>A vocal-orchestral piece, The Bermudas, set three texts ending with Marvell's poem; its tranced evocation of marine distance calls for further revival. </p> <p>Until his last years, Hamilton was always very aware of the public role and responsibilities of the composer. In 1958, he was chairman of the Composers' Guild, which much later on (1975) was to present him with the Ralph Vaughan Williams Award as composer of the year. He was also chairman of the music section of the ICA (1958-60), a member of the BBC's Music Advisory Panel, and did much work for the Society for the Promotion of New Music. </p> <p>From 1952-58 he taught at Morley College, London, and from 1956-60 at London University. As a lecturer, his animated style and rapid rate of delivery exactly displayed the mercurial aspect of his character. As a private teacher, he was conscientious and encouraging, patient and wise, always eager to instil professional standards of behaviour in his pupils. </p> <p>By the late 1950s, an even younger generation of composers had been captivated by the new sounds and ideas coming out of Darmstadt and Donaueschingen, Cologne and Paris. Hamilton, too, began to study Webern: the result was immediate and radical. With the Sonata for Chamber Orchestra and the Cello Sonata (both 1958) and the Nocturnal for 11 solo voices, Hamilton suddenly aligned himself with the continental avant-garde of the day. A major collision with a disconcerted public came when the Sinfonia for Two Orchestras was performed at the 1959 Edinburgh Festival. The rest of his compositional career was to be a gradual retreat from this extreme position. </p> <p>In 1961, Hamilton went to live in New York and thence commuted regularly to North Carolina, where he was professor of music 1962-78. In 1962, he was resident composer at Tanglewood: he also acted as visiting composer to the University of Alabama and various other institutions. Visits to the West Indies in the mid-1960s added a Caribbean flavour to his musical interests. </p> <p>From childhood, Hamilton had been enthralled by the theatre, and in his fifties turned to writing operas, usually adapting his own libretto from a pre-existing literary source. The best known of his operas is The Royal Hunt of the Sun (after Peter Shaffer, 1967-69), produced at the London Coliseum in 1977. The Cataline Conspiracy (after Ben Jonson, 1972-73) awoke interest because of its apparent relevance to contemporary events, as the governments of Edward Heath and Richard Nixon came to a close. Anna Karenina was performed by English National Opera in 1978, and later had a revival.

But the tides of interest and of fashion had turned, and his music, old or new, was now to be heard only rarely. The BBC offered only a token celebration of his 70th birthday in 1992. </p> <p>In his personal life, a process of withdrawal from even those who had been intimate friends made him an increasingly isolated figure, saddening all those who remember his quirky high spirits and vitality, sharp intelligence, keen sense of the ridiculous, and his integrity, wisdom and generosity as adviser, teacher and friend. </p> <p>\u0095 Iain Ellis Hamilton, composer, born June 6 1922; died July 21 2000</p>",
