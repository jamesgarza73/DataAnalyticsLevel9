      "trailText": "<p>After years of sanctions, it was Serbia's passionate student movement that finally sparked the downfall of Milosevic's feared and repressive regime, says  Helena Smith</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The shambolic, ignominious fall of Slobodan Milosevic, for 13 years the most powerful figure in Yugoslavia, proves again that student power - the irreverence of youth - is the one enduring factor no leader should ever take for granted. </p> <p>Milosevic appeared immovable until Generation X, Serbs as young as 16 who had only ever known war, decided to dislodge him, according to Balkan specialists. </p> <p>The rottenness of the regime may have enabled it to collapse bloodlessly and in record time (three hours, witnesses say). But it was the birth and dedication of the student movement known as Otpor (\"Resistance\") which ultimately brought much-needed momentum to a process that Serbia's disillusioned democrats had otherwise given up on. </p> <p>Amidst all the mirth and mystery still shrouding the precise chain of events that lead to Milosevic's calamitous defeat, there is one thing of which historians are in no doubt: the tyrant's ouster owes as much to the irrepressible optimism of Otpor as it does to the millions of dollars invested in the opposition by the west. Eventually, Serbia's youth - wide-eyed teenagers, university attendees and graduates - did what 10 years of economic sanctions, isolation and Nato bombs failed to do. </p> <p>\"In Serbia we have seen students yet again replace the workers,\" says Robert Rotberg, director of the Kennedy School's programme on intra-state conflict at Harvard University. \"It happened in Hungary in 56, Iran in 79, China in 1989 and then Prague. Workers have more at stake. Students don't have jobs, families, children, and at the barricades they're not so easily coerced. They're fed on the rhetoric of change and they can galvanise people around them.\" </p> <p>From the start Otpor was a non-violent movement. But it had an ingenuous, grassroots strategy that it followed from the outset; one that allowed the group to build the biggest possible anti-Milosevic coalition. Its ranks ultimately included members of Serbia's Orthodox church and other once-prominent nationalists. </p> <p>By artfully blending street protests with plain silly happenings, the movement managed to channel anger into the countryside, where ordinary Serbs, manipulated by Milosevic's propaganda machine, had no idea how to vent their frustration. </p> <p>\"We made a few very simple calculations,\" explains Vuk Jeremic, Otpor's international representative who \"spread the message\" from his Tower Hill home in London. </p> <p>\"Our polls showed that 40% of the population was so disillusioned, after 13 years of war, poverty and the Nato bombing, it did not even want to vote. When we found out that at least 65% of that number was between 18 and 25 we realised we had found our target audience.\" </p> <p>The hope, he said, was to get at least 70% of the population to vote \"because you can steal 150,000 votes, but it's practically impossible to steal a million\". </p> <p>With the clenched-fist as their symbol, the activists had two slogans - Vremeje (\"It's Time\") and Gotov Je (\"He's Finished\"); three weapons - badges, stickers and posters; and one mission - to give people the courage to believe that every ballot would count in the battle to remove a regime that relied on fear. But campaigning was far from easy. \"After the Nato bombing, telling Serbs to emulate western democracies was like putting a red rag to a bull,\" says Jeremic. </p> <p>Recognising Otpor's burgeoning popularity, however, western organisations began injecting much-needed cash into the movement. </p> <p>Last April, Harvard's Kokkalis program on south-eastern Europe at the Kennedy school invited Jeremic and other Serb opposition leaders to flesh out their policies at a now historic conference. \"There was a lot of arguing, but there were US state department officals there who said, 'If you want to campaign, this is what you should do'.\" The advice was to prove invaluable. </p> <p>Otpor was originally conceived to resist the draconian 1997 university law purging higher education establishments of opposition voices. From its birth, it operated as an amorphous group that eschewed leadership as much as it avoided politics (other than the cause of democracy) in a deliberate bid to both elude detection and keep squeaky clean. </p> <p>More than anything, historians say, it was the movement's incorruptible, innocent image that helped transform it into a truly national force. By election day, Otpor had opened 140 branches across the pariah state, its clenched fist and optimistic tone infiltrating every village and hamlet. </p> <p>\"Otpor was much less institutionalised than any of the opposition parties,\" says Slobodan Homen, one of the movement's original founders. \"But it was very organised and disciplined and could adapt much more easily to any situation. Being flexible enabled us to mobilise a huge number of people who were disappointed in the opposition and saw through the lies of the regime.\" </p> <p>A lot of that initial support came from the families of Otpor members, now believed to exceed some 50,000.

      "bodyText": "The shambolic, ignominious fall of Slobodan Milosevic, for 13 years the most powerful figure in Yugoslavia, proves again that student power - the irreverence of youth - is the one enduring factor no leader should ever take for granted. Milosevic appeared immovable until Generation X, Serbs as young as 16 who had only ever known war, decided to dislodge him, according to Balkan specialists. The rottenness of the regime may have enabled it to collapse bloodlessly and in record time (three hours, witnesses say). But it was the birth and dedication of the student movement known as Otpor (\"Resistance\") which ultimately brought much-needed momentum to a process that Serbia's disillusioned democrats had otherwise given up on. Amidst all the mirth and mystery still shrouding the precise chain of events that lead to Milosevic's calamitous defeat, there is one thing of which historians are in no doubt: the tyrant's ouster owes as much to the irrepressible optimism of Otpor as it does to the millions of dollars invested in the opposition by the west. Eventually, Serbia's youth - wide-eyed teenagers, university attendees and graduates - did what 10 years of economic sanctions, isolation and Nato bombs failed to do. \"In Serbia we have seen students yet again replace the workers,\" says Robert Rotberg, director of the Kennedy School's programme on intra-state conflict at Harvard University. \"It happened in Hungary in 56, Iran in 79, China in 1989 and then Prague. Workers have more at stake. Students don't have jobs, families, children, and at the barricades they're not so easily coerced. They're fed on the rhetoric of change and they can galvanise people around them.\" From the start Otpor was a non-violent movement. But it had an ingenuous, grassroots strategy that it followed from the outset; one that allowed the group to build the biggest possible anti-Milosevic coalition. Its ranks ultimately included members of Serbia's Orthodox church and other once-prominent nationalists. By artfully blending street protests with plain silly happenings, the movement managed to channel anger into the countryside, where ordinary Serbs, manipulated by Milosevic's propaganda machine, had no idea how to vent their frustration. \"We made a few very simple calculations,\" explains Vuk Jeremic, Otpor's international representative who \"spread the message\" from his Tower Hill home in London. \"Our polls showed that 40% of the population was so disillusioned, after 13 years of war, poverty and the Nato bombing, it did not even want to vote. When we found out that at least 65% of that number was between 18 and 25 we realised we had found our target audience.\" The hope, he said, was to get at least 70% of the population to vote \"because you can steal 150,000 votes, but it's practically impossible to steal a million\". With the clenched-fist as their symbol, the activists had two slogans - Vremeje (\"It's Time\") and Gotov Je (\"He's Finished\"); three weapons - badges, stickers and posters; and one mission - to give people the courage to believe that every ballot would count in the battle to remove a regime that relied on fear. But campaigning was far from easy. \"After the Nato bombing, telling Serbs to emulate western democracies was like putting a red rag to a bull,\" says Jeremic. Recognising Otpor's burgeoning popularity, however, western organisations began injecting much-needed cash into the movement. Last April, Harvard's Kokkalis program on south-eastern Europe at the Kennedy school invited Jeremic and other Serb opposition leaders to flesh out their policies at a now historic conference. \"There was a lot of arguing, but there were US state department officals there who said, 'If you want to campaign, this is what you should do'.\" The advice was to prove invaluable. Otpor was originally conceived to resist the draconian 1997 university law purging higher education establishments of opposition voices. From its birth, it operated as an amorphous group that eschewed leadership as much as it avoided politics (other than the cause of democracy) in a deliberate bid to both elude detection and keep squeaky clean. More than anything, historians say, it was the movement's incorruptible, innocent image that helped transform it into a truly national force. By election day, Otpor had opened 140 branches across the pariah state, its clenched fist and optimistic tone infiltrating every village and hamlet. \"Otpor was much less institutionalised than any of the opposition parties,\" says Slobodan Homen, one of the movement's original founders. \"But it was very organised and disciplined and could adapt much more easily to any situation. Being flexible enabled us to mobilise a huge number of people who were disappointed in the opposition and saw through the lies of the regime.\" A lot of that initial support came from the families of Otpor members, now believed to exceed some 50,000. The sight of youngsters being beaten, or arbitrarily arrested, was more than many Serbs could take. As the repression grew so too did the resistance of exiled Serb students, who also joined the movement. \"We had some 2,500 arrests on record and whenever members were hauled into the police station it was mothers who went and begged for their release,\" says Jeremic. \"Entire families soon joined the cause, often under the influence of their children.\" Do Homen or Jeremic, whose parents fled to England with the rise of Milosevic in 1990, envisage becoming involved in the new Serbia's political scene? There are not a few who believe that Otpor activists could soon be forming the country's new political elite. \"I'm sure a lot of us will want to go into politics once we have finished studies that have been disrupted for so long,\" says Homen, 28. For the moment, however, Otpor is keen to just act as a watchdog \"to see that reform is done\". \"We're not going to go away,\" says Jeremic. \"We're going to watch from below.\" As true revolutionaries who work from the bottom, Serbia's militant youth are clearly going to be the new conscience of their new country. Can you help? Precisely because Serbian students were the target of so much of the ancien regime's venom, Yugoslavia's new politicians are now prioritising educational reform.

He may well be ruing his participation in the match against arch-rivals <strong>New South Wales</strong> in Melbourne after breaking his spinning finger and seeing his side lose heavily. Warne was fielding at first slip when he appeared to juggle a simple chance from <strong>Mark Waugh</strong> - the ball hit the end of his finger, breaking the first joint, and he required surgery to insert two metal plates. Australia's leading wicket-taker will now miss at least the first three Tests of the forthcoming series against West Indies. The entire first day was lost to rain, and after a delayed start on the second morning some creative captaincy was needed to ensure a result. New South Wales reached 250 in their first innings, with Waugh making 53 before being induced to balloon that catch to Warne off the bowling of <strong>Colin Miller</strong>, and <strong>Shane Lee</strong> also making 53. Victoria captain <strong>Paul Reiffel</strong> declared his side's first innings closed at 194-6 with <strong>Brad Hodge</strong> unbeaten on 85, and <strong>Steve Waugh</strong> reciprocated by declaring the New South Wales second innings at 210-6, after an entertaining late cameo from <strong>Don Nash</strong>, who made 46 off just 23 balls. Chasing 267 to win and missing the injured Warne, <strong>Victoria</strong> collapsed to 149 all out in the face of <strong>Brett Lee</strong> (5-42) and <strong>Stuart MacGill</strong> (3-50) who may well be expecting a call-up to the Australian squad. </p> <p><strong>New South Wales</strong> 250 and 210-6 dec <br> <strong>Victoria*</strong> 194-6 dec and 149 <br> <strong>New South Wales won by 117 runs</strong><br> <strong> New South Wales </strong> 6pts, <strong>Victoria</strong> 0pts </p> <p>The one-day Mercantile Mutual Cup game between the same two sides at the Richmond Cricket Ground in Melbourne was a tense, low-scoring affair in which <strong>Victoria</strong> scraped home by two wickets. On a day when ball dominated bat, the star-studded <strong>New South Wales</strong> side managed only 129 after being put in, the only partnership of note being 49 from the <strong>Waugh brothers</strong> for the third wicket. Victoria then made life difficult for themselves by collapsing to 60-5 before a steadying partnership between youngsters <strong>Michael Klinger</strong> (19) and <strong>Ben Oliver</strong> (29). There looked to be another twist to the game as <strong>Brett Lee</strong> (3-41) launched a late onslaught, but experienced wicketkeeper <strong>Darren Berry</strong> (14*) managed to push Victoria over the line. </p> <p><strong>New South Wales</strong> 129 (42 overs) <br> <strong>Victoria*</strong> 130-8 (41.5 overs) <br> <strong>Victoria won by 2 wickets</strong> </p> <p> <strong>South Australia</strong> managed to hold on for an unlikely draw against <strong>Western Australia</strong> in their first Pura Cup game of the season, at the Adelaide Oval.

In reply South Australia managed 282, with a surprising contribution of 51 from fast bowler <strong>Jason Gillespie</strong>, batting at the unaccustomed position of No5. South Australia were asked to follow on and looked in some trouble before <strong>Jeff Vaughan</strong>, who had made a duck in the first innings, gritted his teeth and held on for six-and-a-half hours to make an unbeaten 131, his third first-class century, as the game ended in a draw. </p> <p><strong>Western Australia*</strong> 480-4 dec <br> <strong>South Australia</strong> 282 and 358-5 <br> <strong>Match drawn </strong><br> <strong>Western Australia </strong> 2pts, <strong> South Australia </strong> 0pts </p> <p>Not even a dazzling career-best 233 from <strong>Ricky Ponting</strong> could set up a win for <strong>Tasmania</strong> against <strong>Queensland </strong> in an extraordinary match in Brisbane. After the Tasmania captain <strong>Jamie Cox </strong> had won the toss and elected to bat, Ponting put on a superb display. He struck 37 fours and four sixes, and shared in century partnerships with all-rounder <strong>Dan Marsh </strong> (61), the son of ex-Australian wicketkeeper Rodney Marsh, and <strong>Sean Young</strong> (22). Tasmania looked to be in the driving seat as they dismissed Queensland for 289 and then, with time running out, declared their second innings at 258-7. Ponting (61) and Marsh (58*) again proved their main contributors. Set a daunting 373 to win Queensland never looked in the hunt at 59-3, but a fourth-wicket partnership of 261 between <strong>Martin Love </strong> (161*) and the hard-hitting <strong>Andrew Symonds </strong> (133) set up an unlikely victory with just one over to spare. </p> <p><strong>Tasmania*</strong> 403 and 258-7 dec <br> <strong>Queensland</strong> 289 and 373-6 <br> <strong>Queensland won by 4 wickets </strong><br> <strong>Queensland</strong> 6pts, <strong>Tasmania</strong> 0pts</p> <p> <strong>South Africa </strong></p> <p>Defending Supersport Series champions <strong>Gauteng</strong> (also known this season as the Highveld Strikers due to a sponsorship deal) defeated <strong>North West</strong> by 121 runs at Pootchefstroom, despite an excellent all-round performance from North West's West Indian star, <strong>Mark Lavine</strong>. Lavine destroyed Gauteng's top and middle order with 6-55 in their first innings, and then proceeded to follow it up with 85, including ten fours and three sixes, in North West's first innings. It was a lonely vigil though; Gauteng stepped up a gear in their second innings and made 322, with opening batsman <strong>Sven Koenig</strong> contributing 80. Koenig became the unlikely hero with the gloves in North West's second innings after regular keeper <strong>Nic Pothas</strong> had withdrawn with badly bruised fingers. He took three catches, including one to dismiss the dangerous Lavine, and seamer <strong>David Terbrugge</strong> picked up 5-39 to dismiss North West well short of their target. </p> <p><strong>Gauteng</strong> 224 and 322<br> <strong>North West</strong> 277 and 148<br> <strong>Gauteng won by 121 runs </strong><br> <strong>Gauteng</strong> 16pts, <strong>North West</strong> 7pts </p> <p>A well-crafted, chanceless 128 from captain <strong>Hylton Ackerman</strong> set up a win for <strong>Western Province</strong> in their game against <strong>Eastern Province</strong> at Port Elizabeth. Put in to bat, Western Province scored 362 before dismissing Eastern Province for 282, <strong>Dave Callaghan</strong> (129) scoring almost half the runs. Western Province then declared their second innings closed at 212-8, leaving Eastern Province to chase 293, but man of the match <strong>Claude Henderson</strong>, a left-arm spinner, took 5-40 as Eastern Province managed only 165. </p> <p><strong>Western Province</strong> 362 and 212-8 dec <br> <strong>Eastern Province*</strong> 282 and 165 <br> <strong>Western Province won by 127 runs</strong> <br> <strong>Western Province</strong> 18pts, <strong>Eastern Province</strong> 7pts </p> <p><strong>Easterns</strong> started their campaign with a big win over <strong>Kwa-Zulu Natal</strong> at Benoni, despite a defiant 104 from Kwa-Zulu Natal No9 <strong>Golam Bodi</strong>. The diminutive Bodi, an Indian-born slow left arm bowler, scored his maiden first-class century (easily beating his previous best score of 33) in entertaining fashion, thrashing eleven fours and six sixes, but it was to no avail as Kwa-Zulu Natal went down by 108 runs. Kwa-Zulu Natal had won the toss and asked Easterns to bat, restricting them to 245 as medium-pacer <strong>John Kent</strong> took a career-best 6-77. Kwa-Zulu Natal found themselves equally restricted, struggling to 123 against the bowling of West Indian quickie <strong>Kenny Benjamin</strong> (3-23) and left-arm medium-pacer <strong>Gareth Flusk</strong> (3-31). They were helped by an excellent performance by wicketkeeper <strong>Dylan Jennings</strong>, who took six catches. When Easterns declared their second innings at 284-8 KZN were set 407 to win, but never looked in contention despite Bodi's last-minute knock. They were blown away by the pace bowling of Benjamin (4-79) and <strong>Andre Nel</strong> (5-64). </p> <p><strong>Easterns</strong> 245 and 284-8 dec <br> <strong>Kwa-Zulu Natal*</strong> 123 and 298 <br> <strong>Easterns won by 108 runs</strong> <br> <strong>Easterns</strong> 16pts, <strong>Kwa-Zulu Natal</strong> 4pts </p> <p>Some fine bowling from seamer <strong>Charl Langeveldt</strong> (5-19 and 1-49) and medium pacer <strong>Brad Player</strong> (3-11 and 5-26) ensured a win for <strong>Boland</strong> over <strong>Free State</strong> at Paarl. After asking the visitors to bat Boland blew them away for 102 in their first innings and restricted them to 249 in the second. Boland made 330 in their first innings, mainly thanks to <strong>Pieter Barnard</strong> (120) and <strong>James Henderson</strong> (76), and then openers Henderson and <strong>James Trott</strong> knocked off the 22 runs required in their second innings without loss. </p> <p><strong>Free State</strong> 102 and 249 <br> <strong>Boland*</strong> 330 and 23-0 <br> <strong>Boland won by 10 wickets </strong><br> <strong>Boland</strong> 18pts, <strong>Free State</strong> 2pts </p> <p><strong>Pakistan</strong></p> <p><strong>Lahore</strong> registered a ten-wicket win over <strong>Karachi Blues</strong> in their Quaid-e-Azam Trophy Grade I match at the LCA ground in Lahore, thanks to a sparkling 174 from wicketkeeper-batsman <strong>Kamran Akmal</strong>. He hit 28 fours and one six in his innings, sharing partnerships of 109 for the sixth wicket with <strong>Tariq Mahmood</strong> (46) and 129 for the seventh with <strong>Naeem Ashraf</strong> (28), as Lahore reached 428. Earlier they had dismissed Karachi Blues for 259 after asking them to bat; <strong>Afsar Nawaz</strong> was the mainstay of the Karachi innings with 114. When Karachi managed only 192 in their second innings Lahore were left with a target of 24, which openers <strong>Ali Hussain</strong> and <strong>Maqsood Rana</strong> polished off in 3.3 overs. </p> <p><strong>Karachi Blues</strong> 259 and 192 <br> <strong>Lahore</strong> 428 and 26-0 <br> <strong>Lahore won by 10 wickets</strong></p> <p> In a high-scoring match in <strong>Karachi</strong>, the home side drew with <strong>Bahawalpur</strong> after neither team seemed able to bowl the other out quickly enough for a positive result. Karachi racked up 485-8 declared in their first innings, with <strong>Mohammad Masroor</strong> (97), <strong>Hasan Raza</strong> (81), <strong>Asif Mujtaba</strong> (81) and one-time Pakistan wicketkeeper <strong>Atiq-uz-Zaman</strong> (62) all making major contributions. Bahawalpur replied with 367 (<strong>Shadab Kabir</strong> 84, <strong>Usman Tariq</strong> 62), and Karachi had reached 267-4 in their second innings (<strong>Shadab Kabir</strong> 116, <strong>Zeeshan Pervez</strong> 96) when time ran out. </p> <p><strong>Karachi</strong> 485-8 dec and 267-4 <br> <strong>Bahawalpur</strong> 367 <br> <strong>Match drawn </strong></p> <p>Elsewhere in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy Grade I it was a case of ball dominating bat, with low-scoring games producing wins for <strong>Peshawar</strong> over <strong>Faisalabad</strong>, <strong>Sheikhupura</strong> over <strong>Gujrunwala</strong>, <strong>Rawalpindi</strong> over <strong>Sargodha</strong>, and <strong>Lahore Blues</strong> over <strong>Islamabad</strong>. </p> <p><strong>Peshawar</strong> 174 and 177 (Shahid Nazir 6-58)<br> <strong>Faisalabad*</strong> 73 (Nauman Habib 5-11) and <strong>170</strong> <br> <strong>Peshawar won by 108 runs</strong> </p> <p><strong>Sheikhupura</strong> 146 (Qaisar Abbas 67, Sarfraz Ahmed 5-43) and 194 (Zahid Javed 59, Mubashir Nazir 6-56) <br> <strong>Gujrunwala*</strong> 198 (Naved-ul-Hasan 6-80) and 145-6 (Majid Saeed 94*) <br> <strong>Gujrunwala won by 4 wickets</strong> </p> <p><strong>Sargodha</strong> 106 and 219 (Misbah-ul-Haq 73) <br> <strong>Rawalpindi*</strong> 383-9 dec (Pervez Aziz 154, Naeen Akhtar 64) <br> <strong>Rawalpindi won by an innings and 58 runs</strong> </p> <p><strong>Lahore Blues</strong> 199 (Stephen John 5-82) and 357-9 dec (Imran Farhat 77, Mohammed Hussain 65, Stephen John 5-128) <br> <strong>Islamabad*</strong> 209 (Husnain Kazim 6-58) and 180 (Asif Ali 63) <br> <strong>Lahore Blues won by 167 runs</strong> </p> <p><em>Catherine Hanley is an Australian who supports Somerset but lives and works in Sheffield.

Lavine destroyed Gauteng's top and middle order with 6-55 in their first innings, and then proceeded to follow it up with 85, including ten fours and three sixes, in North West's first innings. It was a lonely vigil though; Gauteng stepped up a gear in their second innings and made 322, with opening batsman Sven Koenig contributing 80. Koenig became the unlikely hero with the gloves in North West's second innings after regular keeper Nic Pothas had withdrawn with badly bruised fingers. He took three catches, including one to dismiss the dangerous Lavine, and seamer David Terbrugge picked up 5-39 to dismiss North West well short of their target. Gauteng 224 and 322 North West 277 and 148 Gauteng won by 121 runs Gauteng 16pts, North West 7pts A well-crafted, chanceless 128 from captain Hylton Ackerman set up a win for Western Province in their game against Eastern Province at Port Elizabeth. Put in to bat, Western Province scored 362 before dismissing Eastern Province for 282, Dave Callaghan (129) scoring almost half the runs. Western Province then declared their second innings closed at 212-8, leaving Eastern Province to chase 293, but man of the match Claude Henderson, a left-arm spinner, took 5-40 as Eastern Province managed only 165. Western Province 362 and 212-8 dec Eastern Province* 282 and 165 Western Province won by 127 runs Western Province 18pts, Eastern Province 7pts Easterns started their campaign with a big win over Kwa-Zulu Natal at Benoni, despite a defiant 104 from Kwa-Zulu Natal No9 Golam Bodi. The diminutive Bodi, an Indian-born slow left arm bowler, scored his maiden first-class century (easily beating his previous best score of 33) in entertaining fashion, thrashing eleven fours and six sixes, but it was to no avail as Kwa-Zulu Natal went down by 108 runs. Kwa-Zulu Natal had won the toss and asked Easterns to bat, restricting them to 245 as medium-pacer John Kent took a career-best 6-77. Kwa-Zulu Natal found themselves equally restricted, struggling to 123 against the bowling of West Indian quickie Kenny Benjamin (3-23) and left-arm medium-pacer Gareth Flusk (3-31). They were helped by an excellent performance by wicketkeeper Dylan Jennings, who took six catches. When Easterns declared their second innings at 284-8 KZN were set 407 to win, but never looked in contention despite Bodi's last-minute knock. They were blown away by the pace bowling of Benjamin (4-79) and Andre Nel (5-64). Easterns 245 and 284-8 dec Kwa-Zulu Natal* 123 and 298 Easterns won by 108 runs Easterns 16pts, Kwa-Zulu Natal 4pts Some fine bowling from seamer Charl Langeveldt (5-19 and 1-49) and medium pacer Brad Player (3-11 and 5-26) ensured a win for Boland over Free State at Paarl. After asking the visitors to bat Boland blew them away for 102 in their first innings and restricted them to 249 in the second. Boland made 330 in their first innings, mainly thanks to Pieter Barnard (120) and James Henderson (76), and then openers Henderson and James Trott knocked off the 22 runs required in their second innings without loss. Free State 102 and 249 Boland* 330 and 23-0 Boland won by 10 wickets Boland 18pts, Free State 2pts Pakistan Lahore registered a ten-wicket win over Karachi Blues in their Quaid-e-Azam Trophy Grade I match at the LCA ground in Lahore, thanks to a sparkling 174 from wicketkeeper-batsman Kamran Akmal. He hit 28 fours and one six in his innings, sharing partnerships of 109 for the sixth wicket with Tariq Mahmood (46) and 129 for the seventh with Naeem Ashraf (28), as Lahore reached 428. Earlier they had dismissed Karachi Blues for 259 after asking them to bat; Afsar Nawaz was the mainstay of the Karachi innings with 114. When Karachi managed only 192 in their second innings Lahore were left with a target of 24, which openers Ali Hussain and Maqsood Rana polished off in 3.3 overs. Karachi Blues 259 and 192 Lahore 428 and 26-0 Lahore won by 10 wickets In a high-scoring match in Karachi, the home side drew with Bahawalpur after neither team seemed able to bowl the other out quickly enough for a positive result. Karachi racked up 485-8 declared in their first innings, with Mohammad Masroor (97), Hasan Raza (81), Asif Mujtaba (81) and one-time Pakistan wicketkeeper Atiq-uz-Zaman (62) all making major contributions. Bahawalpur replied with 367 (Shadab Kabir 84, Usman Tariq 62), and Karachi had reached 267-4 in their second innings (Shadab Kabir 116, Zeeshan Pervez 96) when time ran out. Karachi 485-8 dec and 267-4 Bahawalpur 367 Match drawn Elsewhere in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy Grade I it was a case of ball dominating bat, with low-scoring games producing wins for Peshawar over Faisalabad, Sheikhupura over Gujrunwala, Rawalpindi over Sargodha, and Lahore Blues over Islamabad. Peshawar 174 and 177 (Shahid Nazir 6-58) Faisalabad* 73 (Nauman Habib 5-11) and 170 Peshawar won by 108 runs Sheikhupura 146 (Qaisar Abbas 67, Sarfraz Ahmed 5-43) and 194 (Zahid Javed 59, Mubashir Nazir 6-56) Gujrunwala* 198 (Naved-ul-Hasan 6-80) and 145-6 (Majid Saeed 94*) Gujrunwala won by 4 wickets Sargodha 106 and 219 (Misbah-ul-Haq 73) Rawalpindi* 383-9 dec (Pervez Aziz 154, Naeen Akhtar 64) Rawalpindi won by an innings and 58 runs Lahore Blues 199 (Stephen John 5-82) and 357-9 dec (Imran Farhat 77, Mohammed Hussain 65, Stephen John 5-128) Islamabad* 209 (Husnain Kazim 6-58) and 180 (Asif Ali 63) Lahore Blues won by 167 runs Catherine Hanley is an Australian who supports Somerset but lives and works in Sheffield.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The week in which she was the centre of attention for a BBC film crew ended on a rather prosaic note for Catherine Samuel, the deputy head- teacher of Blaendulais Primary School near Neath. \"I was getting a box down from high up in a storage room when a loose shelf fell on my toe,\" she explains. \"It's not broken but I can't put on my shoe.\" </p> <p>Injured toes apart, Samuel at 60 is as energetic and enthusiastic a teacher of early years as when she started 39 years ago \u0084 the vast proportion of that time at Blaendulais. In fact her connection to the school goes even further back, for between the ages of four and 10 she was a pupil. </p> <p>Although she had a stint as a head, and clearly has had the chance to move into teacher training, Samuel decided to stay in the classroom and nurture the next generation of early years teachers at the same time. \"Above all else, I am a practitioner,\" she says. \"I spotted early on that heads were getting more isolated and so I stayed where I felt I was most effective.\" </p> <p>Samuel's classroom has long been a centre of excellence and there is a constant stream of visitors. \"Just last week I had four teachers in from the Swansea valley. Our present head is a firm believer in inviting others in to see our work: it keeps us on our toes.\" </p> <p>Her nomination arose when a teacher spotted publicity for the Award and thought immediately of her. The idea was mooted at a governors' meeting and received unanimous support. </p> <p>She takes me on a tour of her teaching area. It is made up of a series of sections in which children are offered the richest diet of experiences. \"We have a computer area, and a puppet section - the children love playing with them. Then there is a construction corner, and an interchangeable area which can be transformed into a hospital, a post office or a fire station - depending on whichever visit we are due to make out in the community. In the 'listening station' the children hear stories of the past from some of the older ladies from the village. They also come in to help us make Welsh bread and take part in the old-fashioned wash day.\" </p> <p>Catherine Samuel has a genius for creating school - community links, and always makes parents welcome. One said: \"It is remarkable that Mrs Samuel has maintained such a high standard at the Nursery Unit over 30 years. We really appreciate the commitment she has given to our children. They could not have had a better start with their formal education.\" </p> <p>For children in her class, the year is filled with out-of-school visits ranging from rescuing frog spawn from people's gardens to dropping in on the local dentist to allay some of their fears. </p> <p>Some of the strongest links Samuel has forged have been with local farmers, poultry breeders and gamekeepers, who have supplied her 'growth area' with a wide range of eggs to incubate. \"We have hatched goslings, quails and even pheasants. Our chicks have won awards at the Royal Welsh Show.\" </p> <p>It is not only chicks that go on to achieve excellence by association with Samuel. \"I have always valued the role in the classroom of the nursery nurse,\" she says. \"It is such a waste that they have often been seen as dogsbodies. They have always worked alongside me and I have encouraged several to train to be teachers.\" </p> <p> One former colleague, Ceinwen Williams, said: \"She has proved to be my best teacher, most valued colleague and friend, my mentor and always my inspiration. In truth, she epitomises the best in early years practitioners.\" </p> <p>Asked if there are any children that have particularly stood out for her, she answered that she is proud of them all. They have a high regard for her, too. Alissa Bevan, now aged nine, said, \"Mrs Samuel is very fair; if there is an argument she listens patiently to both sides.\" </p> <p>Samuel refuses to be drawn when asked what will be done with the \u00a320,000 prize. \"All I can say that what happens to the prize will be a whole school decision.\" </p> <p>And what about her plans now her 60th birthday is approaching? Catherine Samuel is clear she is not entertaining thoughts of retirement. \"I still enjoy it all.\" </p> <p><strong>The judge says:</strong> </p> <p>We read nearly every day of the supposed shortcomings of the teaching profession, and yet almost every parent is loud in their acclaim of their own child's teacher. Ever since WWII, there has been a slide in the perceived status and commitment of teachers, who in my young days were seen as the leaders of their community. </p> <p>The Teaching Awards are an attempt to rectify this misunderstanding and to honour the dedication, wisdom and hard work of so many of our teachers. </p> <p>Teaching is even more of a calling than a profession. Our lifetime achievers are all people who have a clear and profound calling to help all their pupils to achieve the unbelievable, to go that extra mile. They give of themselves unselfishly and generously. With nominees of such a high calibre, we relied upon evidence from colleagues, parents and pupils, rather than academic statistics, to make the differentiation between the good and the remarkable. </p> <p>I have been honoured to be given the task of chairing the excellent group of volunteer judges, and humbled by the example of the teachers who have been nominated for awards. They are all a beacon of light and hope for the futures of our young people. <br></p> <p><strong> Sir John Harvey Jones, Chair of judges</strong><br></p> <p><strong>Regional winners: </strong><br></p> <p> <strong>Thomas Baker</strong> North East &amp; Cumbria <br> Red Rose Primary School, Chester Le Street</p> <p> <strong> Christine Balson</strong> West <br> Badocks Wood Primary School, Bristol </p> <p><strong> Rose Marie Bradley </strong>Northern Ireland <br> St Eugene South Primary School, Londonderry </p> <p><strong>David Patrick Fox</strong> North <br>Giggleswick School, Settle </p> <p><strong> David Hammond </strong>East Midlands<br>De Lisle RC Secondary School, Leicestershire</p> <p><strong> Ronald Naylor</strong> North West<br> King Edward VII &amp; Queen Mary School, Lytham </p> <p><strong> Pamela Patterson </strong>South West<br> St Minver County Primary School, Wadebridge </p> <p><strong>Catherine Ann Samuel</strong> Wales <br>Blaendulais Primary School, Neath</p> <p><strong> Phillip Staley </strong>West Midlands<br> Wilkinson School, Bilston </p> <p><strong>Pamela Walker </strong>South East<br> Wellington Primary School, London </p> <p><strong>Michael Weaver </strong>East <br> Woodbridge School, Woodbridge</p> <p> <strong> Shirley Westwood </strong>South Helenswood School, Hastings</p>",

      "bodyText": "The week in which she was the centre of attention for a BBC film crew ended on a rather prosaic note for Catherine Samuel, the deputy head- teacher of Blaendulais Primary School near Neath. \"I was getting a box down from high up in a storage room when a loose shelf fell on my toe,\" she explains. \"It's not broken but I can't put on my shoe.\" Injured toes apart, Samuel at 60 is as energetic and enthusiastic a teacher of early years as when she started 39 years ago \u0084 the vast proportion of that time at Blaendulais. In fact her connection to the school goes even further back, for between the ages of four and 10 she was a pupil. Although she had a stint as a head, and clearly has had the chance to move into teacher training, Samuel decided to stay in the classroom and nurture the next generation of early years teachers at the same time. \"Above all else, I am a practitioner,\" she says. \"I spotted early on that heads were getting more isolated and so I stayed where I felt I was most effective.\" Samuel's classroom has long been a centre of excellence and there is a constant stream of visitors. \"Just last week I had four teachers in from the Swansea valley. Our present head is a firm believer in inviting others in to see our work: it keeps us on our toes.\" Her nomination arose when a teacher spotted publicity for the Award and thought immediately of her. The idea was mooted at a governors' meeting and received unanimous support. She takes me on a tour of her teaching area. It is made up of a series of sections in which children are offered the richest diet of experiences. \"We have a computer area, and a puppet section - the children love playing with them. Then there is a construction corner, and an interchangeable area which can be transformed into a hospital, a post office or a fire station - depending on whichever visit we are due to make out in the community. In the 'listening station' the children hear stories of the past from some of the older ladies from the village. They also come in to help us make Welsh bread and take part in the old-fashioned wash day.\" Catherine Samuel has a genius for creating school - community links, and always makes parents welcome. One said: \"It is remarkable that Mrs Samuel has maintained such a high standard at the Nursery Unit over 30 years. We really appreciate the commitment she has given to our children. They could not have had a better start with their formal education.\" For children in her class, the year is filled with out-of-school visits ranging from rescuing frog spawn from people's gardens to dropping in on the local dentist to allay some of their fears. Some of the strongest links Samuel has forged have been with local farmers, poultry breeders and gamekeepers, who have supplied her 'growth area' with a wide range of eggs to incubate. \"We have hatched goslings, quails and even pheasants. Our chicks have won awards at the Royal Welsh Show.\" It is not only chicks that go on to achieve excellence by association with Samuel. \"I have always valued the role in the classroom of the nursery nurse,\" she says. \"It is such a waste that they have often been seen as dogsbodies. They have always worked alongside me and I have encouraged several to train to be teachers.\" One former colleague, Ceinwen Williams, said: \"She has proved to be my best teacher, most valued colleague and friend, my mentor and always my inspiration. In truth, she epitomises the best in early years practitioners.\" Asked if there are any children that have particularly stood out for her, she answered that she is proud of them all. They have a high regard for her, too. Alissa Bevan, now aged nine, said, \"Mrs Samuel is very fair; if there is an argument she listens patiently to both sides.\" Samuel refuses to be drawn when asked what will be done with the \u00a320,000 prize. \"All I can say that what happens to the prize will be a whole school decision.\" And what about her plans now her 60th birthday is approaching? Catherine Samuel is clear she is not entertaining thoughts of retirement. \"I still enjoy it all.\" The judge says: We read nearly every day of the supposed shortcomings of the teaching profession, and yet almost every parent is loud in their acclaim of their own child's teacher. Ever since WWII, there has been a slide in the perceived status and commitment of teachers, who in my young days were seen as the leaders of their community. The Teaching Awards are an attempt to rectify this misunderstanding and to honour the dedication, wisdom and hard work of so many of our teachers. Teaching is even more of a calling than a profession. Our lifetime achievers are all people who have a clear and profound calling to help all their pupils to achieve the unbelievable, to go that extra mile. They give of themselves unselfishly and generously. With nominees of such a high calibre, we relied upon evidence from colleagues, parents and pupils, rather than academic statistics, to make the differentiation between the good and the remarkable. I have been honoured to be given the task of chairing the excellent group of volunteer judges, and humbled by the example of the teachers who have been nominated for awards. They are all a beacon of light and hope for the futures of our young people.

It has signed up with Tools for Schools, an organisation that refurbishes used computers donated by business and then sells them cheaply to schools. To date the school has taken delivery of 60 computers, 50 of which are now out on loan. The remaining \u00a310,000 has been spent on a new digital camcorder to capture good quality video and a new digital camera. The \u00a33,500 regional award money was used to buy video equipment to capture and edit video on the school's computer network.</p> <p>Inverteign Junior School in Teignmouth spent some of its prize money on a minibus to ferry its children to sporting fixtures.

I was in charge of football and taking kids to matches was always a bit of a nightmare for us because a lot of our parents do not have cars. It was impossible to get to away matches.

We also bought some stage lighting for the hall to make our productions a little bit more professional looking.\" A local artist has also painted a Matisse-like mural on an old mobile classroom in the school's playground.</p> <p>Wingate Nursery School in County Durham is well equipped already, so the school spent the prize money, awarded to headteacher Paddy Beels for working with parents in the community, on training staff to develop children's creative thinking. Schools in Reggio Emilia in northern Italy have developed an innovative pre-school learning approach, now practised in Danish schools. This builds on children's interests.

But it wasn't always this way. When headteacher Eric Gates, winner of this year's award for Working with Parents and the Community in a primary school, arrived, the school, situated in a deprived area of the town, had been placed in special measures by Ofsted.

His school is less immediately impressive, with shambling buildings which the Teaching Awards judges described as the least attractive accommodation they had visited.</p> <p> So much for first impressions. This year 63% of Aldercar's Year 11 gained 5 or more higher grades at GCSE. Many schools in leafy suburbs would be quite satisfied with that figure, but Aldecar, sandwiched between Derby and Nottingham, is a depressed ex-mining community where over a quarter of that year group entered school with reading ages up to 4 years below their chronological age.</p> <p> In 1994 an Ofsted inspection raised serious concerns about the school, but the past 5 years have seen a 231% increase in higher grades at GCSE, an increase the judges described as \"quite staggering\". The school has held the Basic Skills Agency's quality mark for the past two years. Children learn Japanese and, if an application to become a language college is successful, the school hopes to offer Mandarin. Yet in the mid-90s the school's reputation was dire.</p> <p> \"The school was very comfortable with where it was,\" says Cooper. \"Yet the results were mediocre. Every year group were being done a disservice. The quote that I got - and still get - is: 'well, what do you expect from children from that area'.\"</p> <p> Cooper expected better. He was a deputy at the school in the 90s, which he found \"frustrating at times, because you wanted to move things forward.\" When the headship became available colleagues expected him to apply for \"better schools elsewhere\", but there was never any real question of where he wanted to be. \"Anybody can pick the cherries. Go to a school with 90% higher grades, and let things ride. But that's not me.\"</p> <p> With a new management team, Cooper set about seizing the school and its community by the scruff of the neck. An early decision involved bringing support workers into the heart of the school and involving them directly in learning. \"One of the things that used to exist in the school was the attitude 'We're teachers - you're not',\" he says, \"so we've worked on that.\" Blending together a team of lunchtime supervisors, librarians and ancillaries Cooper formed a literacy \"hit squad\" which, on average, raises pupils' reading ages by 20-24 months in just a term of school time. Many of the team are parents. Other initiatives to bring the community into the school include allocating accommodation for the local playgroup, and allowing parents to study alongside pupils in a range of subjects.</p> <p> \"When I first came to this school, people were saying 'You don't want to go there, it's rubbish',\" says year 10 pupil Adam Grice. \"Now some of them want to come here, but they can't get in.\" The children are fiercely proud of their school, particularly as some came to Aldercar after unhappy experiences elsewhere. They understand that the school's encouraging atmosphere is down to their headteacher: \"He's easy to talk to,\" said Laura Wadsley. \"If you have any problems you can go to him and he'll sort it out for you. In my old school I didn't get on with any of the teachers.\"</p> <p> Cooper doesn't see himself as a superhead and he certainly doesn't envisage parachuting into other schools to solve their problems. \"I've yet to be convinced that because someone has done a wonderful job in one school, they can be lifted and dropped into a challenging school and suddenly expect it to rise out of the ashes,\" he says. \"It's taken us five years to get this far and we're not there yet.\"</p> <p> The prize money will be used to support the language college bid. Competing claims on the funding include new sports developments, a community performing arts centre, and the never-ending fight to maintain sub-standard buildings. Moving on isn't an option that has occurred to him. Apart from unfinished agendas, he has his family to consider. His children attend the school and he would like that to continue. \"Ten to 15 years ago this school used to follow in the wake of others,\" he says. \"I'm never going to let that happen again. If something good is available for the kids of this area then we must grab it.\"</p> <p> Led by Tony Cooper, the people at Aldercar seem to have done everything that could have been asked of them. Perhaps someone should have a look at the environment they're expected to work in.</p> <p><strong>The judge says:</strong><br></p> <p>Despite all the talk about superheads running several schools at once, almost all schools have a single head- teacher, usually assisted by one or more deputies. Whenever a school is scrutinised, whether by inspectors, researchers, or the travelling army of schools improvers, its leadership is an important factor in any success and failure. The award winners had inspired teachers, pupils, parents, governors, support staff and their communities, showing that this impossible-looking job can still be done well. Their speeches always stress teamwork: all are respectful about their colleagues and their pupils.

Her hallmark is respect for the children but she also has the skills to go along with it to do an outstanding job.\" \"I am delighted and absolutely honoured to have won,\" Campbell says. \"But you can't single out one teacher because it is all about teamwork.\" And where could the money best be spent?

We are not allowed to say 'I can't' in my classroom; we say 'I have to find another way'.\" She creates books for the children if textbooks are not suitable. This year she has already made about a dozen books, such as 'Life in early Times'. The pupils in turn will do anything to please her and win one of the stickers saying \"I'm one of Mrs Campbell's superstars\". Several parents wrote to support Campbell's nomination, all impressed by the progress their children make with her. \"I think she is just tremendous,\" said Pat McAllister. \"She has a wonderful personality and great sensitivity and puts in an extraordinary effort. Her hallmark is respect for the children but she also has the skills to go along with it to do an outstanding job.\" \"I am delighted and absolutely honoured to have won,\" Campbell says. \"But you can't single out one teacher because it is all about teamwork.\" And where could the money best be spent? Replacing the obsolete Archimedes machines in the primary department; and literary and numeracy resources. Mary Campbell appreciate what the award represents: \"To reach the point that you are recognised by your peers for your contribution to children is extremely gratifying.\" Regional winners: Mary Campbell N Ireland, St Gerard's Education Resource Centre, Belfast Valerie Cordy N West, St Dominics Catholic Junior School, Liverpool Elizabeth Gwynn South, Manor Junior, Hampshire Sian Lane South West, Beacon Heath First, Exeter Susan Marsden E Mids, Westfield Infant, Hinckley Michael Nash W Mids, Great Barr Primary, Birmingham Geraldine Petherbridge Wales, Whitestone Primary, Swansea Madeline Pugh East, St Johns School, Bedford Lindsey Shaw South East, Broadfields Infant, Edgware Teresa Webb West, Avalon School, Somerset Sheila Whitworth North, Lowerhouses CE Primary School, Huddersfield",

      "body": "<p>Cathy Roberts has been head of music at St Aidan's Church of England Secondary school in Harrogate for six years. \"My philosophy is equal opportunities in music for every child,\" says Roberts. \"They each have a creative streak, whatever their coordination and whatever their physical ability. My job is to make them believe in themselves.\" Her enthusiasm for her work has not gone unrecognised - her nomination for the Guardian Award for Teacher of the Year was proposed by the parents.</p> <p>\"We have a Down's Syndrome pupil who is learning flute and piano because she loves music,\" says Roberts. \"I believe music is a marvellous leveller, which develops so many skills - coordination, performance, discipline and listening - which can be brought to other subjects.\" Roberts, 34, has a background in both primary and secondary schools, and taught primary teachers how to teach music. At St Aidans, she heads a team of three full-time music staff, one part-time teacher and 17 instrumental teachers. Headteacher Dennis Richards said: \"In this age of focus on numeracy, literacy and science, it is so refreshing and invigorating to have a musician like Cathy involving each pupil in a subject which might have been sidelined, or deemed less important.\"</p> <p>Around 400 pupils take instrumental lessons, and Roberts directs three ensembles, including the school concert band of 120 which has played in Canada, the US and Sweden. She also heads the Chamber Choir of 52 which has toured Holland, Belgium and Germany, and reached the semi-finals of Sainsbury's Choir of the Year.\"She has a superhuman commitment,\" says Richards. \"In 30 years, I have never met a teacher who comes anywhere remotely near her in terms of devoting their own time to students.\"</p> <p> Her dedication is particularly evident when one learns that once a term the chamber choir sings live for Radio Four's daily service. This requires them to leave school at 5:30am, rehearse from 8am, go live at 9:45 and get back on the bus for school at 10am. \"Cathy works brilliantly under pressure and has enabled a bunch of not naturally outstanding youngsters to sing to a very high standard indeed,\"says Philip Billson, the producer for BBC Religion. \"She achieves this both through her own excellent musicianship, but also her inspiring leadership.\"</p> <p> Roberts' passion for her job means she is at school most nights until 8pm. \"If I've gone the extra mile for music it's in the hours,\" she admits. \"But I don't often think about it, because as soon as I arrive at a cathedral on a Sunday morning and see how excited the children are to perform, it's all worth it.\"</p> <p> Roberts's teaching methods are inclusive, and every pupil at the school will take part in a concert performance. This term, Roberts is teaching year 7 rhythm and singing through the cantata - 230 pupils will then sing at the Royal Hall in Harrogate. \"It is really important that each child experiences a live performance,\" she says. \"Every pupil must know what it is like to be on stage and see the audience clapping them. Every child should be given a voice.\" She is currently teaching rap to year 9, culminating in a performance by 13 and 14 year olds using only their voices and classroom props.</p> <p> When asked about her award, Roberts says: \"I am here to represent the school, so I have won for them. Without the support of other staff, I wouldn't be here.\" The prize money will go towards music technology teaching at the school, which has just started an A-level in the subject. \"Recording and mixing equipment and microphones are important not only for our pupils, but for the local special school and blind students.\"</p> <p> The last word should go to a parent. Pauline Hanover, whose 13-year-old son attends St Aidan's, feels she owes a debt of gratitude to Roberts: \"The musical soul of our son has been encouraged, nurtured and strengthened by Mrs Roberts. Music is undoubtedly her life, and now, through her inspiration, it is our son's.\" </p> <p> Surely that is what every teacher strives to achieve.</p> <p> <strong>The judge says:</strong><br></p> <p> Judging the secondary teacher of the year national award this year, I was very conscious of how proud each school was of their finalist. They saw the award as recognition of both their excellent teacher and their school. We spoke to ex-pupils, present pupils, other staff, parents and the community. We were continually impressed, both by the outstanding teaching and by the ex pupils, parents and others who took time to tell us about the impact of a particular teacher on their lives. </p> <p> Each visit was a school's celebration of the best there is in teaching. If only we could bottle this pride and enthusiasm and give it to those who decry our teachers. While we have teachers like these, the future is bright.</p> <p><strong>Frances Raval</strong><br></p> <p><strong>Regional winners: </strong><br></p> <p><strong>Susan Ball</strong> E Mids, Uppingham Comm.

She also heads the Chamber Choir of 52 which has toured Holland, Belgium and Germany, and reached the semi-finals of Sainsbury's Choir of the Year.\"She has a superhuman commitment,\" says Richards. \"In 30 years, I have never met a teacher who comes anywhere remotely near her in terms of devoting their own time to students.\" Her dedication is particularly evident when one learns that once a term the chamber choir sings live for Radio Four's daily service. This requires them to leave school at 5:30am, rehearse from 8am, go live at 9:45 and get back on the bus for school at 10am. \"Cathy works brilliantly under pressure and has enabled a bunch of not naturally outstanding youngsters to sing to a very high standard indeed,\"says Philip Billson, the producer for BBC Religion. \"She achieves this both through her own excellent musicianship, but also her inspiring leadership.\" Roberts' passion for her job means she is at school most nights until 8pm. \"If I've gone the extra mile for music it's in the hours,\" she admits. \"But I don't often think about it, because as soon as I arrive at a cathedral on a Sunday morning and see how excited the children are to perform, it's all worth it.\" Roberts's teaching methods are inclusive, and every pupil at the school will take part in a concert performance. This term, Roberts is teaching year 7 rhythm and singing through the cantata - 230 pupils will then sing at the Royal Hall in Harrogate. \"It is really important that each child experiences a live performance,\" she says. \"Every pupil must know what it is like to be on stage and see the audience clapping them. Every child should be given a voice.\" She is currently teaching rap to year 9, culminating in a performance by 13 and 14 year olds using only their voices and classroom props. When asked about her award, Roberts says: \"I am here to represent the school, so I have won for them. Without the support of other staff, I wouldn't be here.\" The prize money will go towards music technology teaching at the school, which has just started an A-level in the subject. \"Recording and mixing equipment and microphones are important not only for our pupils, but for the local special school and blind students.\" The last word should go to a parent. Pauline Hanover, whose 13-year-old son attends St Aidan's, feels she owes a debt of gratitude to Roberts: \"The musical soul of our son has been encouraged, nurtured and strengthened by Mrs Roberts. Music is undoubtedly her life, and now, through her inspiration, it is our son's.\" Surely that is what every teacher strives to achieve. The judge says: Judging the secondary teacher of the year national award this year, I was very conscious of how proud each school was of their finalist. They saw the award as recognition of both their excellent teacher and their school. We spoke to ex-pupils, present pupils, other staff, parents and the community. We were continually impressed, both by the outstanding teaching and by the ex pupils, parents and others who took time to tell us about the impact of a particular teacher on their lives. Each visit was a school's celebration of the best there is in teaching. If only we could bottle this pride and enthusiasm and give it to those who decry our teachers. While we have teachers like these, the future is bright. Frances Raval Regional winners: Susan Ball E Mids, Uppingham Comm.

      "bodyText": "Youngsters living on a remote South Atlantic island have became hooked on football during an experiment to find out whether television makes children violent. Locals on St Helena had satellite TV broadcast to them 24 hours a day for five years. Sixty hours of the Supersport channel were screened on the island every week as well as round-the-clock coverage from the Discovery channel, KTV, Movie Magic and the BBC. Experts studied more than 30 hours of video footage of children aged between three and eight recorded in the playgrounds of two of the island's schools. They discovered that instead of showing aggressive, anti-social behaviour learned from TV, the island's 1,000 children became addicted to soccer. The youngsters' behaviour actually improved as they began to take part in team games in a bid to copy their new heroes, including Aston Villa star David Ginola and Manchester United's David Beckham. In fact, the children on the former colony - whose 5,644 inhabitants live a 1,000 miles from the African mainland - were found to be among the best-behaved. Now experts from Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester College of Higher Education, Gloucestershire, have argued that the breakdown of the family network, and not television, is to blame for violent, unruly behaviour.

BMG, Bertelsmann's music industry subsidiary, will withdraw its lawsuit against the company if the collaboration proves successful. Bertelsmann is to develop a new secure file-sharing music service with Napster, which achieved instant notoriety with record executives when it launched a site that enabled fans to download and share music free of charge. Radiohead have been the most high-profile victims of the service, which record companies claim threatens the payment of royalties and the future of the industry. But Bertelsmann has decided to lend money to Napster to develop a more secure service. The service will provide payments to copyright holders, including recording artists, songwriters, record companies and music publishers. Thomas Middelhoff, chairman of Bertelsmann, said rival record and publishing companies should follow his company in embracing music on the net.

      "body": "<p><strong>SVEN THE BOAT COMES IN</strong></p> <p>Is the appointment of Sven-Goran Eriksson as England coach, and the worst weather to hit the British Isles since Mad Jock McDoom Fiver was on work experience at the Met Office, by any chance related? Probably not, seeing as Lazio's Swedish coach is not renowned for his meteorological powers. But with the apocalyptic warnings that filled today's back pages - the Sun's John Sadler practically had a stroke - you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise.</p> <p>The FA (CEO: Adam \"Del Boy\" Crozier) this afternoon confirmed that Eriksson will be the new Kelvin Koogan, signing a five-year contract to take full-time responsibility of the side from July 1 2001, with the potential before this date to coach part-time. Crozier, facing a barrage of \"Lord Nelson would be spinning in his grave\"-style questioning, explained that Eriksson would be moving to London, is very excited about working with English players, and, aside from fellow Swede Tord Grip (who will act as his chief scout), will work with the team already in place. \"Sven-Goran Eriksson was the unanimous choice of our selection team\", Crozier said. \"He is one of the best coaches in the world. We're very certain we've made the right choice.\"</p> <p>It's good that the FA are getting their retaliation in first, as Sven is unlikely to have an easy time of it. The players are reported to have preferred an English coach, the fans certainly did, and some pundits would rather see a foreigner take charge of Britain's media outlets (hang on) than England's football team. This fact was not lost on the Swedish press this morning, who observed: \"Welcome to the world's toughest job, Svennis,\" using their pet name for the former Gothenburg boss. \"Even if there are bigger tasks in the world of football,\" wrote columnist Mats Olsson in the daily Expressen, \"there's nothing that's so prestigious, charged, important and probably so wonderful as being in charge of England.\" Which is probably the best use of \"probably\" for some time.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>DANE DEAL DONE</strong></p> <p>Danish international winger Jesper Gronkjaer was born in Greenland at the height of the summer dog-sled season. So he's a quick lad. But not even he could escape the clutches of Colin Hutchinson, managing director of swanky London boutique Chelsea's of Chelsea. Because today - after a 12-month chase - Hutch finally got his man, signing Gronkjaer from Ajax for an ice-cool \u00a37.8m. Unfortunately for Chelsea fans, the Dane has a slight thigh strain and so won't be arriving until January 1. But despite this problem (Greg Van Rusedski anyone?) there were smiles all round south-west London this morning. </p> <p>\"This is a great move for me,\" a delighted Gronkjaer admitted. \"I was very impressed when I visited Chelsea. I spoke with Claudio Ranieri for two hours and liked what he had told me. I am looking forward to working with him and playing with some of Europe's top players.\" And Dennis Wise too, we wager. Meanwhile, Hutch was also in a happy mood, and quickly allayed fears that Gronkjaer's injury was serious. \"Because of Euro 2000, Jesper only had one week of holiday this summer,\" he claimed. \"The present minor injury needs rest.\"</p> <p>So come January, what type of player will Chelsea be getting for their money? Well, Barcelona wanted him, as did the big clubs in Italy, especially after his performances in Euro 2000, where he averaged 12 dribbles per game - more than any other player. And if that isn't impressive enough, Gronkjaer's favourite film is The Fugitive, and his plans for life outside football include working in a bank. In fact, there's only one potential problem with Chelsea's new golden boy: Gronkjaer is often compared with the Laudrup brothers - and we all know what brother Brian did after just a few weeks at the Bridge.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"We have to make the game more of a show.

Since Camara had been unavailable for selection until the middle of October due to injury and international duty, Houllier thought this strange. \"I can't accept that someone who has been available to this club for only ten days, during which time we played three games and won all three, wants to leave because he is not in the team,\" he reasoned pro-logically. \"It disappoints me for the fans and I don't think its being fair on the club.\"</p> <p>It soon became clear that Houllier had embarked not on an economy programme but an intensive one (with pre-iron settings). Questioning the commitment of Camara - who scored for Liverpool on the day his father died - he continued: \"He is the only player I know who has got injured without playing. The injury was so bad that he could only come back seven weeks later. I don't know what kind of injury he had.\" All this suggests Titi's time at Anfield is at an end, but as previous suitors Manchester City, Bradford and Celtic are no longer interested, he could soon be off back to France.

      "body": "<p>The worst storm for a decade, which caused road and rail chaos across the country, killed six people, and left hundreds of millions of pounds worth of damage in its wake, last night prompted warnings that Britain is now beginning to pay the price of unchecked global warming. </p> <p>Torrential rain and winds up to 90mph uprooted trees, blocked roads, and cut electricity supplies across southern England and Wales. </p> <p>A tornado ripped through a caravan park in Selsey in West Sussex less than 48 hours after a similar twister devastated parts of Bognor Regis, and thousands of people were stranded mid-channel unable to dock in Dover. </p> <p>Last night a tanker began leaking chemicals into the English Channel after it was overcome by high seas. The 14-strong crew of the Italian ship Ievoli Sun was airlifted to safety. </p> <p>Shops, banks and schools were closed as people failed to get to work, and the Environment Agency issued 25 severe flood warnings across Wales, south-east and south-west England. Dozens of rivers broke their banks flooding hundreds of homes, and lifeboats were rescuing stranded people 30 miles inland. In Yorkshire, the first blizzards of the winter coincided with flash floods. </p> <p>The severe weather followed record rainfall in south-east England in October and an exceptionally wet September.

      "bodyText": "The worst storm for a decade, which caused road and rail chaos across the country, killed six people, and left hundreds of millions of pounds worth of damage in its wake, last night prompted warnings that Britain is now beginning to pay the price of unchecked global warming. Torrential rain and winds up to 90mph uprooted trees, blocked roads, and cut electricity supplies across southern England and Wales. A tornado ripped through a caravan park in Selsey in West Sussex less than 48 hours after a similar twister devastated parts of Bognor Regis, and thousands of people were stranded mid-channel unable to dock in Dover. Last night a tanker began leaking chemicals into the English Channel after it was overcome by high seas. The 14-strong crew of the Italian ship Ievoli Sun was airlifted to safety. Shops, banks and schools were closed as people failed to get to work, and the Environment Agency issued 25 severe flood warnings across Wales, south-east and south-west England. Dozens of rivers broke their banks flooding hundreds of homes, and lifeboats were rescuing stranded people 30 miles inland. In Yorkshire, the first blizzards of the winter coincided with flash floods. The severe weather followed record rainfall in south-east England in October and an exceptionally wet September. It is exactly the recipe for disastrous flooding predicted by scientists two years ago when looking at the potential effects of global warming on Britain. Yesterday Marilyn McKenzie Hedger, head of the UK Climate Impacts Programme based at Oxford, said: \"These events should be a wake-up call to everyone to discover how we are going to cope with climate change. \"We have had a 0.6C rise in average temperature in the last century, and extreme events have started to happen with greater frequency.

The Korean War, it says, was essentially a civil war between North and South, which had been artificially divided five years earlier when US and Russian forces divided the country. Interestingly, this analysis has long been argued by some thoughtful western scholars who say that the conventional view of the war as a \"communist plot\" overlooks the domestic elements of conflict between two rival regimes and social systems.

Doctors calculate that in her age group there is a 50% chance of cure if treated conventionally. Teresa, instead, opted to follow the Gerson therapy, a gruelling regime which consists of hourly freshly made organic juices, a strict diet, injections and five coffee enemas a day. It demands a monastic life, tough on participants, friends and relatives. It is costly and requires an iron commitment. So, in the 12 months since Teresa began the treatment, when her story first appeared in the Guardian, how has she fared? </p> <p>Before cancer was diagnosed, Teresa, who is single, worked as an art director in television and lived in Bristol. Her widowed mother, Venetia, has a cottage in Oxford where she teaches cello. After her diagnosis, Teresa moved in with Venetia (she now splits her time between the cottage and a nearby bedsit). The two say they had a good relationship before but have now become \"a team\". </p> <p>\"If you don't get on,\" says Venetia, \"it must be a living nightmare, not least because there's just so much work involved each day, every day.\" </p> <p>Wednesday, when I visit, is organic vegetable delivery day - \u00a3150 worth a week. In the overflowing kitchen, Miche, one of the helpers paid to juice and cook five mornings a week, is preparing Hippocrates soup (tomatoes, celeriac, onions and distilled water), to be eaten twice a day. On the table is a wonderful feast - unless, of course, you are irredeemably wedded to steak, chips, brown sauce and bitter, in which case it is then menu from hell. </p> <p>Gerson does not permit salt, pepper, coffee, tea, wine, processed foods, fats, butter, carbohydrate or protein. Its aim is to detoxify and boost the body nutritionally by introducing large amounts of potassium and removing excess sodium, enabling the immune system to fight off malignancies. Max Gerson, a German army doctor who refined the regime in the 30s, believed that surgery, radiation and chemotherapy hinders rather than helps by damaging the liver and other organs. Scientific proof for his theory is nonexistent. Its popularity rests solely on individual histories. </p> <p>On the table are several dishes, including baked potatoes; red cabbage and chard stalks cooked in orange juice and cider vinegar; aubergines and yellow pepper baked in maple syrup; and hokkaido squash roasted with tarragon, plus a pile of garlic cloves, which Teresa squashes over her food along with linseed oil and low-fat yoghurt. Fast food this isn't. \"We genuinely love the diet,\" says Venetia, a former carnivore. \"Eating is the pleasurable part.\" </p> <p>Teresa is a picture of health; clear eyes, beautiful skin, lots of smiles, a strong sense of humour. She radiates attitude of the most positive kind. \"I see the cancer not as a negative experience but an unexpected turning in my life,\" she says. \"When I'm well, I want to work in this field. It's given me a new beginning.\" </p> <p>Tim Littlewood, Teresa's doctor at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, specialises in haematological cancers. \"It's rare to meet a person as serene and confident as Teresa - with or without lymphoma,\" he says. On her last visit, he adds, her blood tests were normal, she had no lumps and there was no evidence that the lymphoma had returned. </p> <p>A scan would reveal the precise state of Teresa's health but she refuses to have one. \"No matter what it revealed, it wouldn't alter how I'm choosing to treat the cancer,\" she says. \"Even after the two years are up, I'll continue with a modified diet because I just feel weller and weller.\" </p> <p>In her early 20s, Teresa developed dermatomyasitis, a muscle-wasting disease. Steroids were prescribed. Teresa refused and opted for exercise and acupuncture instead. It was a fortunate decision, since steroids might have masked the cancer. Eighteen months ago, Teresa developed a lump under her arm. It was diagnosed as benign, so she refused to have it removed. </p> <p>Three months of intense pain followed, and one lump developed into three. Twice she asked for the lumps to be looked at again; both times she was given painkillers. Finally, the specialist treating her dermatomyasitis saw the lumps and ordered tests. Teresa embarked on the first course of chemotherapy. </p> <p>It hospitalised her for three days. \"I was convinced that because my body was already so weak from the dermatomyasitis, the chemo would kill me, even if the cancer didn't,\" she explains. \"I decided on Gerson. People around me were horrified. My oncologist at the time told me that I would die and I was really scared. Since taking the decision though, I've never lost faith - not once. I'm not seeking another five years of life. My aim is to become completely well.\" </p> <p>She knows that for others, Gerson has been tougher. One friend with three small children has died. Others have minimal help; they struggle with the diet and find the experience much more of an emotional roller-coaster. Teresa says that recently, boredom has begun to bite. She finds herself skipping enemas then worrying about the effect on her recovery; she now loathes the weekly injection of vitamin B12 and liver extract and is aware that she doesn't rest enough. She has taken up yoga and begun an Open University degree in health and disease but the strictures of Gerson preclude a normal social life. \"It can be very isolating,\" she says, more as a statement of fact than in search of pity. \"But I don't have a single regret.\" </p> <p>\"A year on, it's like being in the trenches,\" her mother says. \"It's no longer a novelty, you don't have the same adrenalin rush; others naturally don't have the same degree of interest.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<b> December 1999</b> <p> Karen complains of a bad back. We see a doctor and begin consultations with a chiropractor. Karen constantly feels down and we talk of putting off another IVF attempt until she feels better. Kal begins taking antidepressants but didn't want to take them over the Christmas period because of the side effects. </p> <p> <b> January 2000</b> </p> <p> Karen continues to complain of her bad back and is very distressed by it. She works for only three days this month. She constantly phones me at work because she feels so down, alone and anxious. I get a phone call to say she has collapsed, rush home and call out the doctor; he gets her admitted to the Princess of Wales hospital at Bridgend. They carry out various tests on her to no avail and she is discharged but must return for further tests. She has a CAT scan whilst in hospital but nothing is found. </p> <p>We arrange for Karen to see a counsellor, as she continues to feel down and that everyone is against her. The talks help at first but then the panic attacks begin to take over. </p> <p> <b> February</b> </p> <p>Karen's depression continues. We are constantly visiting the doctors and Karen talks to her counsellor. Unfortunately there is no improvement, Kal is taking antidepressants but they don't suit her and she suffers from side effects. The doctor changes the medication and tries to find a drug that suits her. </p> <p>The panic attacks and anxiety get worse and life between us begins to get fractious. Kal continues with her visits to try to ease her back pain. </p> <p> <b> March</b> </p> <p>The confusion starts to become really bad. Kal is up and down to the loo all night and gets lost returning to the bedroom, and it's only next door. She tries to get into bed either via the wardrobe or by trying to climb through the wall. Life is very stressful and Karen's mum moves in with us to help me look after her. </p> <p>I begin to sleep in the spare room as Kal keeps me up all night and I have to get up at 6.30am to get ready for work. We find that the osteopath is not helping Kal's back; we seek help for Kal from someone who specialises in Chinese medicine, at the Centre for Natural Medicine in Cardiff. He finds it difficult to treat her, as he has to fight with the effects of the anti-depressants that Kal is taking. </p> <p> <b> April</b> </p> <p>The confusion is at its worst. Karen has started to lose her sense of balance and cannot walk unaided. The antidepressants aren't working and the doctor prescribes another one: it must be the fourth or fifth we have tried. Reading the literature that is supplied with the dopethin, one of the side effects is confusion. I ask the doctor about this and I am reassured that this will wear off as the body adjusts itself to the medication. It doesn't and Kal is readmitted to the psychiatric unit at the Princess of Wales Hospital just before Easter. Karen's mum and I are asking for help trying to cope with Kal but to no avail; we so desperately need help and no one is listening. </p> <p>Kal spends four days in hospital and is assessed in a 60-minute interview with the psychiatric team. I am not impressed as they (I'm informed) did not consult the nursing staff about Kal. She is discharged and the team inform me that Kal's problem is behavioural and not psychiatric. I ask for help yet again but no one listens to me. Kal is showing signs of loss of balance and cannot walk unaided and I have to help her walk from the interview room. </p> <p>A social worker visits Kal whilst she is in hospital and talks to her mum. She informs her that she was really disappointed with Kal as she was not making any sense when she interviewed. I'm livid and cannot believe that the social worker could be so insensitive to Kal and our needs. </p> <p>We have no further contact from her and are left to cope on our own again. At home I have to remove fuses from electrical appliances and hide all medication from Kal as she is not capable of looking after herself any more. She has left the hairdryer running and placed it on the carpet, switched electric blankets on for no reason and once, when left for five minutes, was found by a neighbour wandering around the village. </p> <p> <b> May</b> </p> <p> This is as bad as it gets. Karen is really bad, the confusion is dreadful, the bad back continues and we are all very stressed. We have to feed Karen, shower her and help her in everything she does. She is hypersensitive to touch and finds any form of contact painful. She can hardly walk and we feel that she is aware that there is something seriously wrong with her. We constantly try to reassure her, that we will find out what is wrong and that she will get better. </p> <p>We are still trying to cope on our own but now we are receiving disability living allowance and sick pay; this helps a bit. Money is starting to become very tight. I'm helping Kal's mum with her travelling expenses, as she is a pensioner. I sold my sports car earlier in the year and that money is keeping our heads above water; we can probably last until Christmas, and then we will have to sell the house. I just hope that nothing happens at work so that I lose my job. </p> <p>Karen's mum is finding it extremely difficult trying to cope as Kal is just too much for her to handle. I know I find it difficult enough and feel so guilty going off to work and leaving Kal's mum to look after her. She has had a rough time over the past few years. Firstly her husband died unexpectedly, and then she had breast cancer followed by hepatitis. I worry about her being poorly again and the cancer reappearing. </p> <p>Karen is very ill and the confusion manifests itself in many different ways. She is convinced we have Australians staying with us and keeps looking for them, making them cups of tea and trying to get meals ready for them. It is very distressing seeing her struggle to make several cups of tea, some of which turn out to be cold water, others just have a teabag in, and still others are empty. </p> <p>Some days she asks me to take her home as she doesn't like being in Australia, and talks about the baby we spent so long trying for.

      "bodyText": "December 1999 Karen complains of a bad back. We see a doctor and begin consultations with a chiropractor. Karen constantly feels down and we talk of putting off another IVF attempt until she feels better. Kal begins taking antidepressants but didn't want to take them over the Christmas period because of the side effects. January 2000 Karen continues to complain of her bad back and is very distressed by it. She works for only three days this month. She constantly phones me at work because she feels so down, alone and anxious. I get a phone call to say she has collapsed, rush home and call out the doctor; he gets her admitted to the Princess of Wales hospital at Bridgend. They carry out various tests on her to no avail and she is discharged but must return for further tests. She has a CAT scan whilst in hospital but nothing is found. We arrange for Karen to see a counsellor, as she continues to feel down and that everyone is against her. The talks help at first but then the panic attacks begin to take over. February Karen's depression continues. We are constantly visiting the doctors and Karen talks to her counsellor. Unfortunately there is no improvement, Kal is taking antidepressants but they don't suit her and she suffers from side effects. The doctor changes the medication and tries to find a drug that suits her. The panic attacks and anxiety get worse and life between us begins to get fractious. Kal continues with her visits to try to ease her back pain. March The confusion starts to become really bad. Kal is up and down to the loo all night and gets lost returning to the bedroom, and it's only next door. She tries to get into bed either via the wardrobe or by trying to climb through the wall. Life is very stressful and Karen's mum moves in with us to help me look after her. I begin to sleep in the spare room as Kal keeps me up all night and I have to get up at 6.30am to get ready for work. We find that the osteopath is not helping Kal's back; we seek help for Kal from someone who specialises in Chinese medicine, at the Centre for Natural Medicine in Cardiff. He finds it difficult to treat her, as he has to fight with the effects of the anti-depressants that Kal is taking. April The confusion is at its worst. Karen has started to lose her sense of balance and cannot walk unaided. The antidepressants aren't working and the doctor prescribes another one: it must be the fourth or fifth we have tried. Reading the literature that is supplied with the dopethin, one of the side effects is confusion. I ask the doctor about this and I am reassured that this will wear off as the body adjusts itself to the medication. It doesn't and Kal is readmitted to the psychiatric unit at the Princess of Wales Hospital just before Easter. Karen's mum and I are asking for help trying to cope with Kal but to no avail; we so desperately need help and no one is listening. Kal spends four days in hospital and is assessed in a 60-minute interview with the psychiatric team. I am not impressed as they (I'm informed) did not consult the nursing staff about Kal. She is discharged and the team inform me that Kal's problem is behavioural and not psychiatric. I ask for help yet again but no one listens to me. Kal is showing signs of loss of balance and cannot walk unaided and I have to help her walk from the interview room. A social worker visits Kal whilst she is in hospital and talks to her mum. She informs her that she was really disappointed with Kal as she was not making any sense when she interviewed. I'm livid and cannot believe that the social worker could be so insensitive to Kal and our needs. We have no further contact from her and are left to cope on our own again. At home I have to remove fuses from electrical appliances and hide all medication from Kal as she is not capable of looking after herself any more. She has left the hairdryer running and placed it on the carpet, switched electric blankets on for no reason and once, when left for five minutes, was found by a neighbour wandering around the village. May This is as bad as it gets. Karen is really bad, the confusion is dreadful, the bad back continues and we are all very stressed. We have to feed Karen, shower her and help her in everything she does. She is hypersensitive to touch and finds any form of contact painful. She can hardly walk and we feel that she is aware that there is something seriously wrong with her. We constantly try to reassure her, that we will find out what is wrong and that she will get better. We are still trying to cope on our own but now we are receiving disability living allowance and sick pay; this helps a bit. Money is starting to become very tight. I'm helping Kal's mum with her travelling expenses, as she is a pensioner. I sold my sports car earlier in the year and that money is keeping our heads above water; we can probably last until Christmas, and then we will have to sell the house. I just hope that nothing happens at work so that I lose my job. Karen's mum is finding it extremely difficult trying to cope as Kal is just too much for her to handle. I know I find it difficult enough and feel so guilty going off to work and leaving Kal's mum to look after her. She has had a rough time over the past few years. Firstly her husband died unexpectedly, and then she had breast cancer followed by hepatitis. I worry about her being poorly again and the cancer reappearing. Karen is very ill and the confusion manifests itself in many different ways. She is convinced we have Australians staying with us and keeps looking for them, making them cups of tea and trying to get meals ready for them. It is very distressing seeing her struggle to make several cups of tea, some of which turn out to be cold water, others just have a teabag in, and still others are empty. Some days she asks me to take her home as she doesn't like being in Australia, and talks about the baby we spent so long trying for. I spend hours on end trying to explain to Kal that we live in a bungalow and do not have an upstairs. I show her the loft to prove we do not have an upstairs and she becomes very upset. Karen has become very aggressive to both her mum and myself; she has attacked me on several occasions. She hallucinates constantly and talks to her father who, as far as she is concerned, is here in the house with us. When I take her out in the car she gets very anxious and tries several times to climb out when travelling at 70mph.

Residents of Yalding in Kent were last night evacuated from their homes by the Army as parts of the town flooded, although an agency spokesman said the situation there was not expected to worsen. PA WeatherCentre said heavy blustery showers would continue to batter the south coast, with Cornwall, Hampshire, Kent and Sussex taking the brunt. The rain was forecast to carry on today, tomorrow and Thursday, with Friday and Saturday expected to be dry. Environment minister Michael Meacher said the storms were evidence of change in the climate. He said: \"As a result of pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, at a level in excess of what the atmosphere can cope with as a result of that, a blanket appearing in the atmosphere is gradually warming up the earth.\" The storm brought much of the rail network to a standstill yesterday and rail firms were battling today to get services already hit by speed restrictions imposed after the Hatfield crash back to normal. Passengers tried to cross live rail lines in driving rain yesterday in a bid to catch trains, the director general of the train operating companies, George Muir, said today. He defended the decision to shut down large sections of the southern zone. Hundreds of homes around the country were evacuated as severe flood warnings were issued, including Kent, Essex and North Yorkshire. Shops and banks across the country were forced to close yesterday and some schools were due to remain shut today. The London Chamber of Commerce estimated that the gales cost the capital's economy up to \u00a3100m in lost production yesterday. A man was killed when his motorbike hit a tree on the A378 near Taunton, Somerset. Another person was killed and two seriously injured when a tree fell on to two vehicles on the A3, near Hindhead, Surrey. In south London, 31-year-old computer technician Richard Clark was killed on Sunday night when his car hit surface water and skidded into a parked car and then a bus. And at sea, a Dutch skipper is feared to have fallen to his death due to ferocious seas off the Devon coast. The high winds were last night blamed for the death of a lorry driver after a van was blown into the path of his vehicle on the A17 at Kirkby la Thorpe, in Lincolnshire. And the storms were feared to have claimed another victim after a man jumped into the River Thame in Birmingham yesterday in an apparent attempt to escape arrest. In the Commons, Mr Prescott said that local and central government leaders would meet tomorrow to discuss how to undertake a more in-depth analysis of what needs to be done. He said that along with emergency services, and the Environment Agency, they would want to examine how to review systems for dealing with emergencies. Mr Prescott offered his \"deepest sympathy\" to the relatives of those who died, and congratulated the emergency services on doing a \"magnificent job\". He said that the Environment Agency would draw up a report on the lessons to be learnt from the floods two weeks ago in East Sussex and the current floods. He confirmed that the weekend's storms were, according to the Met Office, \"the most severe since 1987\".",

      "bodyText": "Palestinian clashes with Israeli troops today left more dead, after a night of Israeli helicopter assaults on Yasser Arafat's command centres. A 17-year-old died in the gunfire and a second was left brain dead after Palestinians threw stones and firebombs in retaliation at Israeli troops on the Gaza Strip Last night's helicopter assault was in response to the killing of two Jews, presumably by Palestinians. Yesterday, a security guard was shot dead in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem and the resident of a Jewish neighborhood stabbed. In Nablus, the largest West Bank town, Palestinians shot in the air when they heard the roar of helicopter engines but failed to prevent the gunships from sending two missiles into the Fatah office in the city. Israeli machine gun fire also damaged the temple and offices of the biblical Samaritans, followers of an offshoot of Judaism. Mr Arafat accused Israel of destroying the peace process as he toured one of the sites damaged by the helicopter attacks, a base for his bodyguards in Gaza. But he said that the assaults would not break Palestinian resolve: \"What happened here and elsewhere in the Palestinian territories will not shake one hair on the head of the Palestinian children.\" The Israeli government's chief police adviser Danny Yatom said the rocket attacks were intended as a warning to Fatah, whose gunmen have taken the lead in shooting attacks on Israeli targets. \"We are trying to signal to the Palestinians that we know who is responsible,\" he said. Monday night's attack was one of the most intense by Israel in 34 days of fighting. Peace talks are on hold, and one obstacle to their resumption is the political instability in Israel. Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak was today working to build a political alliance with the ultra-orthodox Shas party as prospects faded for a partnership with the hawkish Likud faction. For several weeks, Mr Barak has sought to bring Likud leader Ariel Sharon into his minority government, but negotiations broke down on Monday after the prime minister refused to grant Likud a veto right over future peace talks. \"He is not fit to lead the country,\" said Mr Sharon, whose visit to a contested Jerusalem shrine is cited by the Palestinians as a trigger for the weeks of Israeli-Palestinian fighting.",

Young sufferers often fail at school and are even suspended or expelled because of their uncontrollable actions. Around 3% of the population, mainly children, have ADHD or attention deficit disorder (ADD). The incidence of cases has increased threefold between 1991 and 1995, with the trend still rising. <p><br><b>What is Ritalin?</b><br> Ritalin is a stimulant, chemically similar to cocaine or amphetamines like speed but, surprisingly, works by actually calming sufferers down. It is a class B drug and its chemical name is methylphenidate hydrochloride.</p> <p><br><b>How widely is Ritalin used?</b><br> Last year, 157,000 prescriptions were written for Ritalin, mainly for children. It has been around for 50 years but its use rose dramatically during the nineties with prescriptions doubling every year until 1999. Prescriptions have levelled off but are still rising overall.</p> <p><br><b>Does Ritalin work?</b><br> Some parents say their children's lives have been transformed for the better by the drug. However, others claim that Ritalin has turned their youngsters into \"monsters\" or \"zombies\", claiming it is used like \"a chemical cosh\" to make hyperactive children docile, leaving them staring into space and dreamy. Parents in the US are taking legal action against Ritalin manufacturers, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, alleging that the company failed to warn about its possible impact on children's cardiovascular and nervous systems. Here, there have also been allegations of over-prescription of Ritalin, with huge increases in the number of children diagnosed with ADHD and put on psychoactive drugs. Campaigners are concerned that the UK is going the way of the US, where four million children are taking Ritalin. There are claims that some UK doctors are now dishing the pills out \"like smarties\". The US author, Elizabeth Wurtzel, who wrote Prozac Nation, told earlier this year how she became addicted to Ritalin, chopping up and snorting up to 40 tablets a day. </p> <p><b>What are the government doing?</b><br> The NHS's \"best practice\" watchdog is to issue guidelines advising caution on its use for very young children. There are concerns that the use of the medication can mask emotional or other causes of troubled behaviour. Psychiatrists have warned that toddler tantrums, for example, may be confused with more serious disorders. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (Nice) was setting out advice today on who should be prescribed the drug. Nice is expected to recommend that Ritalin should not be given to under-fives. Although older children may continue to receive it, there will be clearer definitions of the conditions for which it can be beneficial as part of a specialist treatment programme. The move is a bid to end the \"postcode lottery\" where patients in some parts of the country have access to the drug and others are denied it. The body is also expected to give a clearer definition of exactly who can benefit from it. Ministers, manufacturers and patients have had a few weeks to challenge the findings before today. The guidelines will cover England and Wales. </p> <p><b>Will everyone welcome this development?</b><br> No. Gill Mead, of ADHD Support for Families, said parents of younger children would be \"disappointed\" if they were refused medication. She said: \"Most parents start coming to us when their children first enter social situations - nursery school. The touch-paper is ignited, the minute you put them into situations that trigger anxiety. \"Some parents are very anti-medication. I can recall a sad case of two head teachers with a son diagnosed with ADHD. They said, 'We don't need medication and we don't need to pump our son full of drugs' - they came back to me and said they wished they had tried drug treatment because he is now up for grievous bodily harm.\" Ms Mead firmly believes that Ritalin works, \"not only for the child but for the parents, who are given enough of a breathing space from troubled behaviour to assist the family to maintain the love for that child\". </p> <p><br><b>What do supporters of the drug say?</b><br> Caroline Hensby, a mother-of-three from Thanet, Kent, has a teenage son with ADHD and last year she was diagnosed with ADD at the age of 37. She believes Ritalin has helped both her and her son Richard. She said: \"There have been a lot of scare stories about Ritalin but it has helped thousands and thousands of children and adults. I used to lose my temper and just explode. \"Now I can recognise a situation where that might happen, focus and stop myself from exploding. It means children who were failing at school can actually sit and learn and do well.\" </p> <p><br><b>Are there any alternatives?</b><br> There are but these are also controversial. In the US, the family of a man who shot dead his baby daughter and tried to kill himself is suing a British drug company which produced the ADHD drug Adderall. Ryan Ehlis, 26, from North Dakota, in the US, was acquitted of the murder of his five-week-old daughter Tyra. The case was dismissed after psychiatrists for the prosecution and defence agreed that the prescription medicine he was taking for was responsible for the tragedy by inducing in him a temporary psychosis. Adderall is the main rival to Ritalin in the US, where it had captured 28% of the market by the end of last year. A spokeswoman for Shire Pharmaceuticals said: \"The safety profile for Adderall is extremely good. Out of 10m prescriptions to date, there have been only 14 incidents of psychosis and they were very mild. This is the only one that was serious.\" Novartis say its drug is a mild stimulant with no association to violent behaviour. \"But some children, and probably some adults, with ADHD suffer from other conditions which may make their management more complex,\" it said in a statement.</p> <p><br><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/focus/story/0,6903,158122,00.html\">Ritalin made my son a demon - Observer</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.healthyalternatives.co.uk/attentiondeficitdisorder06.html\">Natural alternative to Ritalin</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/disability-research/1998-07/0112.html\"> Ritalin for other problems</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.novartis.co.uk/\">Keyplayer - Novartis</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "BSkyB today unveiled a new campaign to thwart the BBC's plans to launch TV channels including new children's networks. BSkyB wants new rules that will give it a slice of licence payers' money for its own channels. Sky's director of public affairs, Ray Gallagher, said the money the BBC was planning to spend on its new services - BBC3, BBC4 and two children's networks - should be ploughed into a new public service \"fund\" available to all. The fund would be ringfenced from the BBC but the corporation and other organisations could pitch for it, he said at today's Royal Television Society autumn symposium. Mr Gallagher argued that the BBC's recently revised licence fee settlement, which will deliver hundreds of millions of pounds in extra funding up to 2006, should be split into two pools, for core BBC services and new digital offerings. The latter money should form the new public service fund, which could be used to finance new arts or children's services. Mr Gallagher added that the BBC had been awarded the extra money for new services by the government, without setting out specifically what those services would be. Mr Gallagher said: \"Much of what passes for debate about public service broadcasting is not about what's best for the public, but what's best for public service broadcasters. Market failure must be the fundamental test of what public resources should be allocated to public service broadcasting.\" Granada TV bosses also had their begging bowls out today. Granada Media chief executive Steve Morrison agreed with the idea of a public service fund for new digital services that any TV company could bid for. But he said this fund should come from new money, and should not be taken from the existing BBC licence fee. Mark Thompson, BBC director of television, countered, saying the suggestions were simply non-starters.

Thanks for nothing.\"</p> <p>But Lawrence is not the only one who is angry. \"We've sold out to all we once knew as english,\" cries Zee Bacchus. \"And I do not apologise for spelling \"english\" without a capital \"E\" - that is how it should be spelt in future, if a Swede coaches england.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile a much more coherent argument comes from Simon Morehen. \"Didn't David Davies himself say that the FA are looking for a coach with integrity?\" he points out. \"How does he square this with Sven Goran Eriksson reneging on his agreement to coach Blackburn?\"</p> <p>The clear majority of our readers, however, seem to support Eriksson's appointment. \"As much as it hurts to admit to being a second class footballing nation a foreign coach could well be the answer,\" reckons Richard Lowes. </p> <p>\"His non-domestic impartiality and experience in handling the biggest egos in world football could stand Eriksson in good stead. And seeing some players for perhaps the first time will perhaps be a bonus towards his first squad selection. Not having been immersed in the Phillips/Cole/Heskey debate - among others - will enable him to bring a fresh perspective.</p> <p>\"As long as the FA does not stop here and continue with this new approach the (distant) future could be rosy for us,\" he adds.</p> <p>And Matthew Willis agrees, although he wants to know why the choice of a foreign manager has become inevitable. \"Personally, I don't find it an insult to my pride, as so many narrow minded xenophobes have stupidly suggested that England are about to have a foreign coach,\" he says. \"But the point I'm interested in, which doesn't seem to have been discussed greatly, is why there is such a shortage of English candidates? Or, put another way, why are English footballers so bloody stupid?\"</p> <p>\"The answer to this would seem to me to be the culture of English football, which has traditionally removed anyone capable of kicking a ball from the normal system of education. It doesn't seem to be the same with foreign footballers - looking at all of the fluent English speaking players in the Premiership, the majority are foreign.</p> <p>\"If English football is to be self-reliant ever again, the system needs to start putting more emphasis on education and basic literacy.\"</p>",

Thanks for nothing.\" But Lawrence is not the only one who is angry. \"We've sold out to all we once knew as english,\" cries Zee Bacchus. \"And I do not apologise for spelling \"english\" without a capital \"E\" - that is how it should be spelt in future, if a Swede coaches england.\" Meanwhile a much more coherent argument comes from Simon Morehen. \"Didn't David Davies himself say that the FA are looking for a coach with integrity?\" he points out. \"How does he square this with Sven Goran Eriksson reneging on his agreement to coach Blackburn?\" The clear majority of our readers, however, seem to support Eriksson's appointment. \"As much as it hurts to admit to being a second class footballing nation a foreign coach could well be the answer,\" reckons Richard Lowes. \"His non-domestic impartiality and experience in handling the biggest egos in world football could stand Eriksson in good stead. And seeing some players for perhaps the first time will perhaps be a bonus towards his first squad selection. Not having been immersed in the Phillips/Cole/Heskey debate - among others - will enable him to bring a fresh perspective. \"As long as the FA does not stop here and continue with this new approach the (distant) future could be rosy for us,\" he adds. And Matthew Willis agrees, although he wants to know why the choice of a foreign manager has become inevitable. \"Personally, I don't find it an insult to my pride, as so many narrow minded xenophobes have stupidly suggested that England are about to have a foreign coach,\" he says. \"But the point I'm interested in, which doesn't seem to have been discussed greatly, is why there is such a shortage of English candidates? Or, put another way, why are English footballers so bloody stupid?\" \"The answer to this would seem to me to be the culture of English football, which has traditionally removed anyone capable of kicking a ball from the normal system of education. It doesn't seem to be the same with foreign footballers - looking at all of the fluent English speaking players in the Premiership, the majority are foreign. \"If English football is to be self-reliant ever again, the system needs to start putting more emphasis on education and basic literacy.\"",

If accepted, DMGT's bid will immediately be referred to the Department of Trade &amp; Industry's competition commission, as the combined circulation of the groups' newspapers would exceed 500,000. The London-based Hinduja brothers, who run oil, banking and cable TV companies in Europe and India, will not be subjected to regulatory scrutiny as they do not own any UK newspapers. Meanwhile, industry sources today claimed that Express Newspapers may barely break even when revenue from the West Ferry print operation, a joint venture with the Daily Telegraph, is stripped out of its revenue figures. DTI regulations allow a newspaper to bypass the regulatory minefield if it can prove that its acquisition target is in dire financial straits. The Daily Telegraph has an arrangement with its business partner that allows it to buy the other 50% of the West Ferry plant should the Express be bought. Conrad Black is expected to make a bid for the Express titles through his Hollinger company. He was unavailable for comment this afternoon.",

BBC Online has over half a million pages of content covering just about everything you could ever want to know about, from music and sport to education and the arts.

It also contains highly maintained interactive sites dedicated to the BBC's most popular programmes, including EastEnders and Changing Rooms. </p> <p> <strong> Q. How long has it been around?</strong><br> A. BBC Online launched in November 1997 as a collection of programme-related sites.

How much money has the BBC invested so far?</strong><br> A. About \u00a390m of licence-payers money. BBC Online was launched with an initial investment of \u00a330m and the corporation has since spent about \u00a330m a year on the service. This represents about 1% of the total licence fee income - the equivalent of several years-worth of EastEnders. </p> <p><strong> Q. How much is it planning to spend?</strong><br> A.

BBC Online is the most popular site in Britain and the most-visited non-portal website outside the US.

At the height of the BSE crisis, the last government banned the feeding of mammalian meat and bone meal to cattle but stopped short of outlawing all animal by-products.",

MacLaurin is reported to have said: \"It's ridiculous. If someone is under suspicion he should be removed from the game until the case is heard and his innocence is proven. If an England player were involved that is what would happen.\" Critics of MacLaurin say his comments will inspire the Pakistanis against England.</p> <p>Since the Qayyum report in May, the chairman of the ICC's Code of Conduct Commission, <strong>Lord Griffiths</strong>, has been considering evidence to see if further action should be taken against the \"guilty\" Pakistan players,<strong> Wasim Akram</strong>, <strong>Mushtaq Ahmed</strong>, <strong>Inzamam-ul-Haq</strong>, <strong>Saeed Anwar</strong> and <strong>Waqar Younis</strong>.

He is reported to have said: \"I don't see how that will help. Ultimately it is the players who have to be honest. You can fill in 10 such forms and still tank a match.\"</p> <p><strong>Sunday October 22 </strong><br> The Sunday Telegraph's <strong>Scyld Berry</strong> reports that two West Indian cricketers have been named in the long-awaited report on match-fixing by India's CBI. Four Indian cricketers - <strong>Mohammed Azharrudin, Ajay Jadeja, Ajay Sharma and Manoj Prabhaker</strong> - were named on Saturday October 21 by the Indian Express in a summary of the leaked report. The Sunday Telegraph reveals that in a chapter on foreign players in the report, two senior West Indies players and three Australians are named - but no England players. The involvement of the two West Indians, says Berry, relates to a qualifying match during the World Cup in 1996, when the Caribbean side surprisingly lost by 73 runs to Kenya. He concludes by saying that the evidence is mounting that about half of Test-playing countries have been tainted by match-fixing. </p> <p><strong>Monday October 23</strong><br> According to Reuters, India's federal investigators announce they will present their interim report into allegations of match-fixing to the government during the week ahead. </p> <p>The Australian Cricket Board says it will ignore what it describes as \"unsubstantiated reports\" accusing unnamed Australian players of being included in the Indian CBI's report on cricket's betting scandal until more substantial evidence emerges. </p> <p><strong>Tuesday October 24</strong><br> The West Indies Board is reported to have asked to see the report by India's CBI before commenting on allegations that two of its players have been involved in the scandal. The claim relates to the shock 1996 World Cup match where the West Indies lost to Kenya by 73 runs. </p> <p><strong>Wednesday October 25</strong><br> Former Pakistani umpire <strong>Javed Akhtar</strong> says he will sue <strong>Ali Bacher</strong> of the United Cricket Board of South Africa to the tune of R100M (about \u00a31,210,000) for bringing his name into disrepute. Bacher is reported to have accused Akhtar of giving eight questionable lbws during the crucial Headingley Test between England and South Africa in 1998. Bacher said Akhtar was paid to influence the result of that 5th and final Test that England won by 23 runs and that he colluded with a bookmaker whose name starts with R. Bacher first accused Akhtar when he was interviewed by the Australian newspaper in April, although he later retracted the statement saying he had been misquoted. However, he again levelled charges against Akhtar in front of the King Commission in June. </p> <p><strong>Thursday October 26 </strong><br> <strong>Richie Richardson</strong> denies that he is one of the two West Indians reported to be named in the CBI report. The former West Indies captain told Starcom Network Sports: \"I never had approaches and I wasn't aware of the sort of things that were going on. I could not conceive that somebody could be playing for their country and want to sell a match.\" Richardson said during his career he had received calls from individuals asking about the weather and the toss, but he hadn't thought anything of this. He said: \"Match-fixing is a serious thing and whoever is involved should be dealt with severely. I can't say exactly how, but I just think they should be dealt with severely. It's the worst thing anybody can do - to sell out their country.\" </p> <p>The manager of the Kenyan cricket team who beat the West Indies in 1996, <strong>Harilal Shah</strong>, says allegations that the match was rigged are \"total nonsense\". Shah, now vice-chairman of the Kenyan Cricket Association, said to the Kenyan national newspaper, the Daily Nation: \"I was present during the match and [what] I saw in the faces of the West Indies team was total shock and disbelief.\" </p> <p><strong> Friday October 27</strong><br> <strong>Wasim Akram</strong> tells the Guardian's Paul Weaver how angry he is with England and Wales Cricket Board chairman <strong>Lord MacLaurin</strong>. Akram said: \"I lived in England and have been helping England whenever I could for the past 12 years, working with youngsters and trying to do my best while I play. So when the boss of English cricket says [I should be banned for the series against England] of course I'm going to be disappointed.\" He also claims the allegations of match-fixing have given him diabetes. </p> <p><strong>Sunday October 29 </strong><br> India's CBI report will be handed to the Union Sports Minister on Monday October 30 according to agency sources in Delhi. Reports indicate at least five Indian players will be named in the 150-page report, plus some foreigners, based on the testimony of bookmakers. </p> <p><strong>Monday October 30</strong><br> The Guardian reports that the public hearings into alleged match-fixing by Cronje have been postponed until next year, according to <strong>Judge Edwin King</strong>, who leads the inquiry. </p> <p>The CBI's interim report on betting and match-fixing was finally handed to the Union Sports Minister <strong>SS Dhindsa</strong> in New Delhi today. Dhindsa said that he will seek a legal opinion on what possible action can be taken against those found \"guilty\" in the report. </p> <p>India's Star Television said <strong>Mohammed Azharuddin, Ajay Jadeja, Nayan Mongia, Manoj Prabhakar, Ajay Sharma, Mark Waugh</strong> and <strong>Salim Malik</strong> were also named in the CBI report. <strong>Brian Lara</strong> has denied any involvement.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday October 31</strong></p> <p><strong>Manoj Prabhakar</strong> has hit back at reports that he has been found \"guilty\" in his country's CBI interim report on match-fixing. Prabhakar, who made allegations against former team-mate and coach <strong>Kapil Dev</strong>, said: \"I don't know on what basis my name is being bandied about. If serving the nation is a crime, I plead guilty. As far as I am concerned, now the ball is neither in the CBI's court nor in the Government's court but it is in the people's court. It is for the people of the country to decide whether I am guilty or not.\"</p> <p>West Indies Cricket Board chief <strong>Pat Rousseau</strong> is reported to have said he would not \"fuel the rumour mill\" by commenting on an Indian government report that allegedly accuses <strong>Brian Lara</strong> and others of involvement in a match-fixing scandal. According to Associated Press, Rousseau told The Observer newspaper in the Caribbean: \"So far all we can hear is sources saying this and that without a shred of evidence.\"</p> <p>English cricket is stunned when <strong>Alec Stewart</strong> is dragged into the scandal. It is reported that Indian sports minister <strong>SS Dhindsa</strong> is claiming that the names of Stewart and <strong>Brian Lara</strong> are in the CBI's report due to be released on Wednesday November 1, but he did not reveal the context in which their names appeared. It is unclear whether Stewart and Lara are accused of any wrongdoing.</p> <p>Stewart and ECB officials in Pakistan declined to comment on the reports. Dhindsa said on Star News TV: \"Lara is there, and Stewart, the English player.\"</p> <p> <em>Watch this space</em></p>",

I don't subscribe to the point of view that Pakistan played any fixed matches.\" Sunday October 15 The Independent's Derek Pringle says Wasim Akram may face a ban of between two years and life if the ICC Code of Conduct Commission decide the Qayyum Report didn't go far enough. It is reported that the four Indians against whom the CBI is alleged to have collected \"circumstantial evidence\" are unlikely to face prosecution under the country's Prevention of Corruption Act as they are not public servants who come under its jurisdiction. News circulates that the report is likely to find Kapil Dev not guilty of the allegations levelled by Manoj Prabhakar, that Kapil had offered him a bribe to under-perform in a one-day international against Pakistan in Colombo in 1994. The timing of the chairman of the ECB, Lord MacLaurin, is questioned when he calls for a ban on players named in the Qayyum Report, including Wasim Akram, during the three-Test series against England. MacLaurin is reported to have said: \"It's ridiculous. If someone is under suspicion he should be removed from the game until the case is heard and his innocence is proven. If an England player were involved that is what would happen.\" Critics of MacLaurin say his comments will inspire the Pakistanis against England. Since the Qayyum report in May, the chairman of the ICC's Code of Conduct Commission, Lord Griffiths, has been considering evidence to see if further action should be taken against the \"guilty\" Pakistan players, Wasim Akram, Mushtaq Ahmed, Inzamam-ul-Haq, Saeed Anwar and Waqar Younis. According to an English newspaper report today, Griffiths has concluded that more severe punishment is needed. South African players reportedly question the timing of the announcement of Cronje's life ban just before the ICC tournament. Monday October 16 Lawyers for Cronje say they may sue the UCBSA over his life-ban. His legal representative, Leslie Sackstein, says the decision is unlawful but he declines to say why, claiming it is privileged information. Former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Condon, who heads the newly-established ICC anti-corruption unit, says it will not interfere with the match-fixing and bribery inquiries set up by the ICC's affiliated nations. The unit will receive $4 million over the next year. Wasim Akram describes Cronje as \"a brave man\". The former Lancashire captain says: \"At least he admitted he did something wrong.\" Akram says Cronje has a point when he says he was treated unfairly compared to Shane Warne and Mark Waugh. Indian sports minister SS Dhindra says his country's interim report on the match-fixing will be tabled in parliament in November. Tuesday October 17 Wasim Akram speaks out over Lord MacLaurin's comments and says his call for bans on some Pakistan players are an attempt to distract them from the series against England. Lt Gen Tauqir Zia also joins in, saying MacLaurin's comments are \"unnecessary and negative tactics\". The UCBSA ignores the deadline set by Cronje's lawyers to repeal their ban on him. Cronje demands he be allowed to work as a cricket columnist and broadcaster. Thursday October 19 The ICC met in Kenya during the ICC tournament and announce today that they are encouraged that the PCB \"intends to pursue a policy of no tolerance to corruption\". They say that Lord Griffiths has been asked, however, as a matter of some urgency, to secure further confidential information from Pakistan before producing his final report. The ICC confirms they are content with the penalties imposed on South Africa's Henry Williams and Herschelle Gibbs, who have been banned until the start of 2001. All international players, umpires, referees, team officials, administrators, employees and curators/groundsmen will be required to complete confidential questionnaires before November 30. Among the five questions, one asks whether individuals have \"ever taken part in or been approached to take part in any arrangement with any other person involved in the playing or administration of the game of cricket which might involve corruption in any form\". The other questions involve rigged matches, infringements of the ICC's code of conduct, weather information for financial gain and playing badly to contrive a result. There is a report that the King Commission will resume in November after all. Friday October 20 India captain Sourav Ganguly is unimpressed by the ICC's documents on fair play which players and officials will be soon required to sign. He is reported to have said: \"I don't see how that will help. Ultimately it is the players who have to be honest. You can fill in 10 such forms and still tank a match.\" Sunday October 22 The Sunday Telegraph's Scyld Berry reports that two West Indian cricketers have been named in the long-awaited report on match-fixing by India's CBI. Four Indian cricketers - Mohammed Azharrudin, Ajay Jadeja, Ajay Sharma and Manoj Prabhaker - were named on Saturday October 21 by the Indian Express in a summary of the leaked report. The Sunday Telegraph reveals that in a chapter on foreign players in the report, two senior West Indies players and three Australians are named - but no England players. The involvement of the two West Indians, says Berry, relates to a qualifying match during the World Cup in 1996, when the Caribbean side surprisingly lost by 73 runs to Kenya. He concludes by saying that the evidence is mounting that about half of Test-playing countries have been tainted by match-fixing. Monday October 23 According to Reuters, India's federal investigators announce they will present their interim report into allegations of match-fixing to the government during the week ahead. The Australian Cricket Board says it will ignore what it describes as \"unsubstantiated reports\" accusing unnamed Australian players of being included in the Indian CBI's report on cricket's betting scandal until more substantial evidence emerges. Tuesday October 24 The West Indies Board is reported to have asked to see the report by India's CBI before commenting on allegations that two of its players have been involved in the scandal. The claim relates to the shock 1996 World Cup match where the West Indies lost to Kenya by 73 runs. Wednesday October 25 Former Pakistani umpire Javed Akhtar says he will sue Ali Bacher of the United Cricket Board of South Africa to the tune of R100M (about \u00a31,210,000) for bringing his name into disrepute. Bacher is reported to have accused Akhtar of giving eight questionable lbws during the crucial Headingley Test between England and South Africa in 1998. Bacher said Akhtar was paid to influence the result of that 5th and final Test that England won by 23 runs and that he colluded with a bookmaker whose name starts with R. Bacher first accused Akhtar when he was interviewed by the Australian newspaper in April, although he later retracted the statement saying he had been misquoted. However, he again levelled charges against Akhtar in front of the King Commission in June. Thursday October 26 Richie Richardson denies that he is one of the two West Indians reported to be named in the CBI report. The former West Indies captain told Starcom Network Sports: \"I never had approaches and I wasn't aware of the sort of things that were going on. I could not conceive that somebody could be playing for their country and want to sell a match.\" Richardson said during his career he had received calls from individuals asking about the weather and the toss, but he hadn't thought anything of this. He said: \"Match-fixing is a serious thing and whoever is involved should be dealt with severely. I can't say exactly how, but I just think they should be dealt with severely. It's the worst thing anybody can do - to sell out their country.\" The manager of the Kenyan cricket team who beat the West Indies in 1996, Harilal Shah, says allegations that the match was rigged are \"total nonsense\". Shah, now vice-chairman of the Kenyan Cricket Association, said to the Kenyan national newspaper, the Daily Nation: \"I was present during the match and [what] I saw in the faces of the West Indies team was total shock and disbelief.\" Friday October 27 Wasim Akram tells the Guardian's Paul Weaver how angry he is with England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Lord MacLaurin. Akram said: \"I lived in England and have been helping England whenever I could for the past 12 years, working with youngsters and trying to do my best while I play. So when the boss of English cricket says [I should be banned for the series against England] of course I'm going to be disappointed.\" He also claims the allegations of match-fixing have given him diabetes. Sunday October 29 India's CBI report will be handed to the Union Sports Minister on Monday October 30 according to agency sources in Delhi. Reports indicate at least five Indian players will be named in the 150-page report, plus some foreigners, based on the testimony of bookmakers. Monday October 30 The Guardian reports that the public hearings into alleged match-fixing by Cronje have been postponed until next year, according to Judge Edwin King, who leads the inquiry. The CBI's interim report on betting and match-fixing was finally handed to the Union Sports Minister SS Dhindsa in New Delhi today. Dhindsa said that he will seek a legal opinion on what possible action can be taken against those found \"guilty\" in the report. India's Star Television said Mohammed Azharuddin, Ajay Jadeja, Nayan Mongia, Manoj Prabhakar, Ajay Sharma, Mark Waugh and Salim Malik were also named in the CBI report. Brian Lara has denied any involvement. Tuesday October 31 Manoj Prabhakar has hit back at reports that he has been found \"guilty\" in his country's CBI interim report on match-fixing. Prabhakar, who made allegations against former team-mate and coach Kapil Dev, said: \"I don't know on what basis my name is being bandied about. If serving the nation is a crime, I plead guilty. As far as I am concerned, now the ball is neither in the CBI's court nor in the Government's court but it is in the people's court. It is for the people of the country to decide whether I am guilty or not.\" West Indies Cricket Board chief Pat Rousseau is reported to have said he would not \"fuel the rumour mill\" by commenting on an Indian government report that allegedly accuses Brian Lara and others of involvement in a match-fixing scandal. According to Associated Press, Rousseau told The Observer newspaper in the Caribbean: \"So far all we can hear is sources saying this and that without a shred of evidence.\" English cricket is stunned when Alec Stewart is dragged into the scandal. It is reported that Indian sports minister SS Dhindsa is claiming that the names of Stewart and Brian Lara are in the CBI's report due to be released on Wednesday November 1, but he did not reveal the context in which their names appeared. It is unclear whether Stewart and Lara are accused of any wrongdoing. Stewart and ECB officials in Pakistan declined to comment on the reports. Dhindsa said on Star News TV: \"Lara is there, and Stewart, the English player.\" Watch this space",

In the 47-year-old Californian's two decades of fiction, you'll find the most obsessively explored sexual pathology since Sade, an uninhibited fascination with the opening of male bodies in the search for some inner perfection, whether through sex or imagined butchery. Murder, mutilation, even paedophile rape are, to the casual observer, passed over with a cool eye. </p> <p>No wonder, you think, he has received death threats (from Queer Nation). No surprise that American Psycho author Bret Easton Ellis calls him, \"the last literary outlaw in mainstream American fiction\". What, though, was William Burroughs thinking when he canonised Cooper as \"a born writer\"? </p> <p>Take another look. And beneath the Californian cool and grisly physicality you may find an artist more to your taste. From the first pages of his debut novel, 1989's Closer, a desire for love infects the carnage. The humour and tenderness in 1994's Try - the cycle's structural and emotional heart, about an 18-year-old boy's search for affection amid ongoing abuse - are undeniable. Pop culture mastery and structural daring are also part of the picture; in Period, prose is pared back almost to notes, and only a lost zombie boy, George - the beloved, damaged hero of Closer - still shows emotion. </p> <p>Cooper comes as no surprise in the flesh, simply because it is useless to imagine who could write such things. Handsome, with glinting yet evasive eyes, he's tense and nervous at first, stuttering answers, but soon settles into lucid honesty. We start talking about Period, and George, the boy who has floated from one end of his fiction to the other. Any idea that the work is that of a sick sadist is quickly snuffed. George was a real boy, his deepest love from his schooldays. Just before starting Period, he discovered that George had died: a shotgun suicide. </p> <p>\"I wanted to make a book that disappeared, that committed suicide,\" Cooper says. \"I wanted it to be a grave for George. It was written out of real grief for this friend. It was about the fact that I actually wrote all these books for him, and then found out by accident he had killed himself, that he'd been dead before I started the first book. That's why Period is so full of guilt, because I'd taken this real boy, the most important person to me, and put him through the mill in my books, until he was abstract. </p> <p>\"And it's full of failure. Because the fact he had killed himself seemed to have something to do with the books. I always thought of them as being for him, but they hadn't done anything for him. I wrote the books partly to resolve my interest in sex and violence - and I did, I got rid of them, they're a joke by the end. But the stuff with George wasn't resolved at all.\" </p> <p>Even the books without George, it turns out, have the same unexpected sentiment. \"Each book has someone in it who is really close to me,\" Cooper says. \"The reason I picked George originally, and then the others, is that I know if they're the main character, I will never hurt them. No matter how bad things get, the books will always be about caring for them.\" </p> <p>Peripheral characters aren't so fortunate. From Cooper's first short stories in the early 1980s (collected in 1992's aptly titled Wrong), beautiful young boys are blankly cut up, raped and ripped, a reason for Queer Nation's ire, and others' repulsion. These are the personally gentle Cooper's own fantasies, obsessively repeated until, with Period, they seem used up. What did he learn, putting such viciousness on the page? </p> <p>\"Clarity. The books have some confused attitudes towards some really terrible things, and so did I. I'm more reasonable for writing them. I used to use a lot of drugs, I used to be crazy, and I'm not any more. I'm not as sexual. I could never just be with someone because I was so interested in the body and what was inside it. It was psychosis to write about it. But when I wrote it, I did believe it.\" </p> <p>Frisk (1991) is Cooper's definitive account of his fantasy life; it includes a long letter describing the imagined destruction of blameless boys sure to shake most readers. Written after Cooper had spent two debauched years in the novel's Amsterdam setting, and directly after an unspecified \"incident where I realised OK, this is not good\", repulsion was not the aim. </p> <p>\"No, I wanted the book to seduce you. He writes that letter wanting company, and I wrote the book to say, 'Am I the only one?' I got all kinds of responses. I got a death threat. I'm going to live down that book the rest of my life. But on the other hand, a lot of people really did understand it. It made me feel better.\" </p> <p>Were Cooper's fiction just a safety valve for his own fetishes, it would be hard to recommend. But his resolve to write out a fantasy life that began, aged 12, when he read about three boys being raped and mutilated near his home and felt a shiver of eroticised fear and fascination - to write it even though his real-life impulses are desperately protective of the young - asks deeper questions, and offers, perhaps, deeper relief. Cooper's dissection of his sexuality, and the unexpressed twists it puts in his head, will strike a chord with more people than may care to admit it. </p> <p>It all sounds \"sick\", he knows. He has a ready-made excuse if he wants it - an alcoholic mother who terrorised him as a child with repeated threats of suicide, a father who beat him. But he won't shift the blame. \"I cut my family off emotionally when I was 16, and barely stayed at home,\" he says. \"So however horrible that stuff was, I don't feel it's the answer.\" </p> <p>Cooper rejected the hippies around him as a teenager too, instead finding his ideals later, in anarchism, punk and the perfectionist writing theory of his idol, Rimbaud, the source of his structural rigour. </p> <p>\"He had absolute purity of intention,\" he declares. \"Otherwise I don't see the point. I would never be satisfied just writing a novel that sells and gets good reviews. It has to be more than that.

      "body": "<p>Decine di capi di stato si riuniranno in dicembre a Palermo per un summit sulla lotta alla criminalit\u00e0 e alle mafie nel mondo. Parteciper\u00e0 all'incontro, su richiesta dell'ONU, anche un'associazione italiana che \u00e8 diventata simbolo di lotta alle mafie: Libera. Questa associazione raccoglie 741 gruppi che operano nei campi pi\u00f9 disparati, con ispirazione religiosa o laica, ma hanno un obiettivo comune: educare alla legalit\u00e0 e alla cittadinanza attiva. Libera conduce la lotta dal basso, col lavoro quotidiano di prevenzione, cultura, impegno civile. Il suo fondatore, don Luigi Ciotti, ne \u00e8 l'anima e lo stimolo. Fra le molte campagne di Libera, la raccolta di un milione di firme che hanno sostenuto l'approvazione della legge del 1996 che consente l'uso dei beni confiscati alla mafia per fini sociali. Questi beni vengono trasformati in scuole, uffici, parchi pubblici, centri sociali, cooperative agricole . . . Vogliamo raccontare una di queste esperienze di riconquista del territorio attraverso le parole di don Salvatore Lo Bue, che ne \u00e8 uno degli artefici, e le opinioni di alcuni giovani. Capiremo cosa lega una bottiglia di olio alla lotta alla criminalit\u00e0! </p> <p>Come nasce l'esperienza della Casa dei Giovani? Don Salvatore Lo Bue - La Casa dei Giovani nasce nel 1983 a Bagheria, vicino a Palermo, luogo famoso per le sue sontuose ville barocche e per la fama di molti suoi figli, come il pittore Renato Guttuso, ad esempio. Ma anche luogo famigerato, roccaforte della grossa mafia che ne ha condizionato pesantemente lo sviluppo. Proprio in una delle ville di Bagheria abbiamo fondato una comunit\u00e0 terapeutica per le tossico dipendenze. Non volevamo solo salvare giovani vite, ma combattere i portatori di morte espressi dalle grandi organizzazioni mafiose internazionali. Dopo la legge del 1996, abbiamo ottenuto dallo Stato un terreno in provincia di Trapani confiscato a Bernardo Provenzano, la primula rossa della mafia, che pare si nasconda proprio a Bagheria. Era un uliveto abbandonato al degrado, che abbiamo reso produttivo. Ci lavorano i ragazzi che escono dalla comunit\u00e0 terapeutica. Da vittime e inconsci collaboratori della mafia, poich\u00e9 spesso a loro volta spacciatori, i ragazzi diventano protagonisti di un impegno civile e politico che li riscatta. Non \u00e8 cosa facile: subiamo intimidazioni, come il taglio alla base di piante di ulivo o l'incendio di un trattore, ma \u00e8 una grossa vittoria. Produciamo olio di oliva di altissima qualit\u00e0. Lo abbiamo chiamato Libera, come l'associazione fondata da don Ciotti di cui facciamo parte. Sull'etichetta abbiamo scritto: \"Dalle terre confiscate alla Mafia . . .\" Cosa pensi di questa esperienza? Sabrina, animatrice scolastica - Sono siciliana, lavoro a Torino ma torno in Sicilia spesso. Quando ho saputo di questa esperienza, il cuore mi si \u00e8 aperto. Ridare ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 stato tolto e dare occasione di lavoro a dei ragazzi \u00e8 bellissimo. Gabriele, studente aTorino - Credo sia positivo trasformare terre mafiose in terre di legalit\u00e0 e ho molta ammirazione per quello che fa Libera. Eleonora, studentessa a Palermo - Impegnare ragazzi con difficolt\u00e0 in una cosa concreta, come produrre olio, \u00e8 un'idea forte. Sentirsi utili \u00e8 importante.</p> <p>Hai mai percepito la presenza della mafia? Sabrina - Quando vado in Sicilia sento che l'aria che si respira \u00e8 pesante. Chi sta bene tende a negare la presenza della mafia, i pi\u00f9 poveri invece la vedono come qualcosa di inevitabile, pensano che non ci sia niente da fare. Gabriele - Direttamente no, ma ho discusso di multinazionali e commercio globale durante una settimana di studio con altri studenti e ho capito come, anche se non lo sentiamo direttamente, malavita e illegalit\u00e0 si insinuano nella vita di tutti.

      "bodyText": "Decine di capi di stato si riuniranno in dicembre a Palermo per un summit sulla lotta alla criminalit\u00e0 e alle mafie nel mondo. Parteciper\u00e0 all'incontro, su richiesta dell'ONU, anche un'associazione italiana che \u00e8 diventata simbolo di lotta alle mafie: Libera. Questa associazione raccoglie 741 gruppi che operano nei campi pi\u00f9 disparati, con ispirazione religiosa o laica, ma hanno un obiettivo comune: educare alla legalit\u00e0 e alla cittadinanza attiva. Libera conduce la lotta dal basso, col lavoro quotidiano di prevenzione, cultura, impegno civile. Il suo fondatore, don Luigi Ciotti, ne \u00e8 l'anima e lo stimolo. Fra le molte campagne di Libera, la raccolta di un milione di firme che hanno sostenuto l'approvazione della legge del 1996 che consente l'uso dei beni confiscati alla mafia per fini sociali. Questi beni vengono trasformati in scuole, uffici, parchi pubblici, centri sociali, cooperative agricole . . . Vogliamo raccontare una di queste esperienze di riconquista del territorio attraverso le parole di don Salvatore Lo Bue, che ne \u00e8 uno degli artefici, e le opinioni di alcuni giovani. Capiremo cosa lega una bottiglia di olio alla lotta alla criminalit\u00e0! Come nasce l'esperienza della Casa dei Giovani? Don Salvatore Lo Bue - La Casa dei Giovani nasce nel 1983 a Bagheria, vicino a Palermo, luogo famoso per le sue sontuose ville barocche e per la fama di molti suoi figli, come il pittore Renato Guttuso, ad esempio. Ma anche luogo famigerato, roccaforte della grossa mafia che ne ha condizionato pesantemente lo sviluppo. Proprio in una delle ville di Bagheria abbiamo fondato una comunit\u00e0 terapeutica per le tossico dipendenze. Non volevamo solo salvare giovani vite, ma combattere i portatori di morte espressi dalle grandi organizzazioni mafiose internazionali. Dopo la legge del 1996, abbiamo ottenuto dallo Stato un terreno in provincia di Trapani confiscato a Bernardo Provenzano, la primula rossa della mafia, che pare si nasconda proprio a Bagheria. Era un uliveto abbandonato al degrado, che abbiamo reso produttivo. Ci lavorano i ragazzi che escono dalla comunit\u00e0 terapeutica. Da vittime e inconsci collaboratori della mafia, poich\u00e9 spesso a loro volta spacciatori, i ragazzi diventano protagonisti di un impegno civile e politico che li riscatta. Non \u00e8 cosa facile: subiamo intimidazioni, come il taglio alla base di piante di ulivo o l'incendio di un trattore, ma \u00e8 una grossa vittoria. Produciamo olio di oliva di altissima qualit\u00e0. Lo abbiamo chiamato Libera, come l'associazione fondata da don Ciotti di cui facciamo parte. Sull'etichetta abbiamo scritto: \"Dalle terre confiscate alla Mafia . . .\" Cosa pensi di questa esperienza? Sabrina, animatrice scolastica - Sono siciliana, lavoro a Torino ma torno in Sicilia spesso. Quando ho saputo di questa esperienza, il cuore mi si \u00e8 aperto. Ridare ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 stato tolto e dare occasione di lavoro a dei ragazzi \u00e8 bellissimo. Gabriele, studente aTorino - Credo sia positivo trasformare terre mafiose in terre di legalit\u00e0 e ho molta ammirazione per quello che fa Libera. Eleonora, studentessa a Palermo - Impegnare ragazzi con difficolt\u00e0 in una cosa concreta, come produrre olio, \u00e8 un'idea forte. Sentirsi utili \u00e8 importante. Hai mai percepito la presenza della mafia? Sabrina - Quando vado in Sicilia sento che l'aria che si respira \u00e8 pesante. Chi sta bene tende a negare la presenza della mafia, i pi\u00f9 poveri invece la vedono come qualcosa di inevitabile, pensano che non ci sia niente da fare. Gabriele - Direttamente no, ma ho discusso di multinazionali e commercio globale durante una settimana di studio con altri studenti e ho capito come, anche se non lo sentiamo direttamente, malavita e illegalit\u00e0 si insinuano nella vita di tutti. Eleonora - L'anno scorso, quando facevamo interviste per strada per il giornale scolastico, percepivamo l'omert\u00e0. Facevamo domande sul pizzo, l'usura, la droga e la gente spesso diceva \"non so\", \"non voglio rispondere\". Cosa pensi possa fare la scuola per educare alla legalit\u00e0?

As the happily married matriarch of daytime television, Feltz's ample cleavage and dimpled cheeks were the essence of tea-and-sugar sympathy; in the year since her marriage broke up and her career took a dive, she has fought back in Daily Mail-approved fashion, drowning her sorrows in Slimfast and losing five stone. </p> <p>So it is almost eerily appropriate that Feltz's new man should be Dennis Duhaney, the personal trainer who helped her lose weight. And even more fitting that their first paparazzi-snapped kiss should be Lycra-clad in a swimming pool, at the Marrakesh Sheraton. (Perhaps they are treading water? Very good for the thighs, after all.) </p> <p>Of course, Feltz is years behind Madonna, who hired, had a daughter by, and dismissed Carlos Leon before most of us even knew what a personal trainer was. Over the past five years, personal trainers have become, for a certain type of woman, as de rigueur a lifestyle accessory as karma bracelets and wheat-free diets. Madonna now has a private yoga teacher, the \u00fcber -chic version of the personal trainer. Victoria Mather, travel editor of Tatler magazine and author of The Party Blonde book of social stereotypes, describes them as \"a matching accessory to the modern woman's life\". Stories of legging-clad lust abound. There is the powerful female media player whose personal training sessions allegedly consist of a 6am run, a 15-minute intimate workout on the sitting room floor, then straight into a gruelling weights session. </p> <p>Matt Roberts Personal Training, which has branches in Knightsbridge, Mayfair, One Aldwych hotel and Mauritius, is one of the most exclusive companies around. Unsurprisingly, John Roberts, brother of Matt and a director of the company, is keen to disabuse the public of the image of personal trainers as glorified strollers. \"It's just not an issue for us. When clients come to us, they are coming to an expert who is going to help them achieve their goals. Of course, it's important for the client to enjoy the process, but the keys to this are professionalism and trust. Any friendship that a trainer and a client have would mean nothing if there were no results.\" </p> <p>As for the pictures of Feltz's swimming pool clinch: \"If a trainer is on holiday with a client to help her make sure she is training every day, that's professional,\" says Roberts. \"But if the relationship goes beyond that it's going to be unhelpful.\" </p> <p>None the less, it doesn't take an in-depth knowledge of psychology to spot the latent erotic potential of the trainer-client relationship. \"It's not complicated,\" says Vicki Woods, a 52-year-old journalist who hired personal trainer Lee Hogan two years ago when she felt she needed to lose weight. \"The thought wouldn't have occurred to me in a million years - we are both happily married and he's much younger than I - but I can definitely see how it happens. Trainers get more up close and personal than almost anyone else, after all. Plus they tend to be 6ft 3in, lightly, but rather brilliantly muscled, bouncing with energy and heterosexual. And they give you all this attention. You find yourself showing off about how you've been eating rice cakes because you want this god-like creature to praise you.\" </p> <p>God-like indeed: while a trainer in a gym is a fitness instructor, personal trainers are usually referred to as \"fitness gurus\". What Mathers calls \"the undivided attention, and from someone who's seen you at your very worst\" is all the more addictive as the trainer typically has a host of female clients. \"He would tell me about his other clients - not their names, he was very discreet, but he'd talk about how one client had done really well, had lost 6lbs this week,\" says Woods. \"So although I didn't know who they were, I knew I was being compared to five or six other women in my area.\" </p> <p>And even if you do keep the relationship strictly professional, others can get the wrong impression. \"When you come lurching out of a copse, purple in the face and lapped with sweat, out of breath and leaning on this long, lean, lithe person in a gleaming singlet, and you bump into your neighbour who's out walking the dog in a Barbour, the look on their face is hilarious,\" says Woods. </p> <p>For many clients, losing weight is closely tied with the process of gaining or regaining sexual attractiveness, which lends the relationship with the trainer a symbolic sexual or romantic significance - whether requited or not. Feltz's new slimline image is a classic example of the breakover phenomenon - a post break-up makeover, designed to show the world and your ex that you have Bounced Bravely Back. </p> <p>Mathers feels that client-trainer relationships \"show exactly the same lack of imagination as a man marrying his secretary. It shows you can't be bothered to go out and do it properly\". After all, standing in sports bra and leggings having your body fat percentage measured isn't exactly the romantic how-we-met story with which one imagines oneself boring the grandchildren. </p> <p>\"It was absolutely the most humiliating experience,\" says Mathers. \"We trained in my drawing room and as well as feeling fat, I'd push back a chair to make room and discover that no one had vacuumed under it in living memory. He was actually a terribly nice man but I started to resent him deeply. It was all just so embarrassing. I go to the gym now, which is much more private than having a personal trainer.\" </p> <p>\"The relationship with a client is important,\" says personal trainer Gerry Jackson. \"As you develop a friendship you understand more about personal problems, the things that mean someone gives 100% one week and not the next. But clients only get too attached if you allow that to happen. If the chemistry gets too strong, it's down to the trainer to think, I'm doing a job here and I can't afford to get involved. It might be fine for a few months, but somewhere down the line it's going to create problems.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "British fashion designer Matthew Williamson, who counts Liz Hurley, Madonna and Julia Roberts among his fans, has teamed up with Saatchi &amp; Saatchi to boost his selling power. The 28-year-old Manchester-born designer has worked with the agency to create a 10-minute film highlighting his work from the recent London Fashion Week. The film, which marks the first time Mr Williamson has collaborated with an ad agency, includes behind-the-scenes footage from his shows and interviews with the designer. It will be used as a promotional tool in-store and sent out to potential buyers. Joseph Velosa, managing director at Matthew Williamson in London, said \"Saatchi &amp; Saatchi has created something much better than we could normally afford. It's great for both parties.\" Showing his first collection in 1997, Mr Williamson has become known for his intricate embroideries, beading, cutaway T-shirts and body-revealing dresses. He now stretches to 50 outfits a show. The film was produced by Inca Productions",

It was argued at the time that the Times and the Sunday Times were both making a loss, although diary extracts from the late Lord Wyatt of Weeford later suggested that Lady Thatcher had colluded with Mr Murdoch and that the Sunday Times was in fact in profit.

      "bodyText": "One of Britain's biggest carmakers, Honda, today announced big changes to production plans at its UK plant, providing fresh evidence that the high value of the pound and uncertainty over the euro is damaging British manufacturing. A previously announced plan to build a new \"super Mini\" at the factory in Swindon has been postponed, the company said in a statement from Tokyo. The carmaker also announced that a 4x4 Honda - the CR-V - which has just started production at Swindon - will be exported to north America. The company cited the continued high value of the pound as one of the main reasons for Honda altering its production plans so that Swindon reaches full manufacturing capacity quicker than previously announced. \"Honda's commitment to the UK remains rock solid,\" said a company spokesman. \"We have worked our way around the euro/high pound problem by adapting manufacturing facilities.\" Employment levels will not be affected by the announcement, with Honda continuing to increase its workforce at Swindon from the present 3,000 to 4,000 by 2002. The company launched a major recruitment drive last month to hire 500 production workers to support planned expansion at Swindon. Sir Ken Jackson, general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, said he was disappointed that the new \"super Mini\" will not be built at Swindon but added he was relieved that no jobs were being lost. \"This shows that unless we join the euro we will become uncompetitive and find it more difficult to export into Europe,\" he said. \"Most companies will not be able to switch markets like Honda and job losses will undoubtedly follow.\"",

Mr Straw's remark that the looming crisis \"places the responsibility on industry and organisations like the health service to get in stocks\" prompted complaints from senior Tories that he is bound to provoke panic buying among ordinary motorists. In a series of radio and TV interviews to promote the government's hard line the home secretary, who chairs the cabinet's civil emergencies committee, also confirmed that soldiers are being rapidly trained - up to 1,000 ministers later admitted - to drive oil tankers. Bernard Jenkin, the Tory transport spokesman, wrote to Mr Straw, accusing him of provoking \"panic buying amongst the population as a whole\" because ministers had been\"humiliated\" by the September protest. As both sides in the dispute flexed their muscles two weeks before the expiry of the protesters' 60 day deadline for tax concessions, Tory MPs at Westminster also denounced ministerial \"sabre rattling\" and demanded to know who would be in charge if troops are de ployed to \"bust any sort of strike\". In the Commons yesterday, the defence minister, John Spellar, confirmed weekend press reports that 1,000 soldiers will have been \"prudently and contingently\" trained to drive oil tankers by the November 13 deadline, to avoid repetition of the rapid collapse of stocks in September. Encouraged by unions which recall the efficiency with which Margaret Thatcher defeated public sector strikes in the 1980s ministers are taking a belligerent line against the motley alliance of farmers, truckers and their allies, determined to show they too can maintain public order and essential supplies in the face of a determined campaign. \"It is absolutely right to make contingency plans in the event that there is a request from the civil authorities for the military forces to train a number of personnel to be able to undertake such tasks in order to maintain the supply of essential services to the nation,\" Mr Spellar told MPs. Opposition MPs demanded to know the legal basis of soldiers' involvement and whether they would all be volunteers for what truckers warn will be a dangerous exercise even without the possibility of intimidation. Oil tankers are hard to drive and carry an explosive cargo, they point out. With the fuel protesters leaders complaining that they have not been allowed to make their case directly to Tony Blair or Chancellor Brown, the financial secretary to the Treasury, Stephen Timms, was forced by the bad weather to postpone a private meeting with freight industry representatives yesterday. \"This was to have been part of a consultation process. It would have been us talking and them listening. We have had a series of meetings and the government are definitely in listening mode,\" Geoff Dossetter, a truckers' spokesman, said. Nine days ahead of Mr Brown's annual pre-budget report, which will signal many of the tax and spending changes in the March budget - including petrol and vehicle taxes-- Mr Timms is seeing a number of representative bodies. Both sides are engaged in a war of nerves ahead of the threatened showdown while keen not to lose public opinion which sided with the protesters in September.

Renewable energy flows to Earth are roughly three times greater than total global energy consumption. But the so-called new renewables - which include modern forms of biomass, as well as small hydropower, wind, solar and geothermal energy - provide only some 2% of global energy, seven-eighths of which comes from biomass. Solar photovoltaics and wind energy capacity are growing fast - at perhaps 30% a year - but it will still be several years before they provide a significant contribution.</p> <p>The short-term driver for change is the Opec price and the potential for disruption. As former Saudi oil minister Sheikh Yamani put it: \"The Stone Age didn't come to an end for the lack of stones, and the oil industry may not end for lack of oil.\" If the Opec cartel or conflict in the Middle East were to push the oil price beyond a certain threshold, it would hasten its own demise by accelerating the flight from oil into alternative fuels.</p> <p>But the real long-term driver remains the relentless advance of climate change disasters. Across the world, millions face drought, flooding and disease. Here in the UK we too face threats - the prospect of exotic diseases becoming commonplace, of floods in some years, droughts in others, of low-lying areas being swallowed by the sea. But we have the opportunity to start tackling the impending crisis now.</p> <p>Michael Meacher is environment minister</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Renewable energy flows to Earth are roughly three times greater than total global energy consumption. But the so-called new renewables - which include modern forms of biomass, as well as small hydropower, wind, solar and geothermal energy - provide only some 2% of global energy, seven-eighths of which comes from biomass. Solar photovoltaics and wind energy capacity are growing fast - at perhaps 30% a year - but it will still be several years before they provide a significant contribution. The short-term driver for change is the Opec price and the potential for disruption. As former Saudi oil minister Sheikh Yamani put it: \"The Stone Age didn't come to an end for the lack of stones, and the oil industry may not end for lack of oil.\" If the Opec cartel or conflict in the Middle East were to push the oil price beyond a certain threshold, it would hasten its own demise by accelerating the flight from oil into alternative fuels. But the real long-term driver remains the relentless advance of climate change disasters. Across the world, millions face drought, flooding and disease. Here in the UK we too face threats - the prospect of exotic diseases becoming commonplace, of floods in some years, droughts in others, of low-lying areas being swallowed by the sea. But we have the opportunity to start tackling the impending crisis now. Michael Meacher is environment minister comment@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p>Autumn has generally got a pretty good press from English poets: \"There is a harmony in autumn, and a lustre in the sky\"; \"Oh, good gigantic smile o' the brown old earth, this autumn morning\"; \"Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness\". It is the same in children's story books. The autumnal illustrations always show happy little girls in thin macs and light-duty wellies scrunching their way through dry piles of leaves. </p> <p>What bilge. October has been a disgusting month throughout, even before this weekend, which provided the most sustained outburst of wind and rain I can remember. It was extra-long too, because of the clocks going back. When a walk was vaguely suggested, even the dog adopted an expression of total contempt. And so far we've been lucky out our way. The thought of spending a stormy night barred from entry to Dover harbour terrifies me even more than the notion of going on a British train. Anywhere. Ever. </p> <p>But it is always like this. In some distant vault of memory, I do recall an autumn that had a lustre in the sky and a gigantic smile. I can date it from where I was living, and the records back me up. Indian summer lingered for ages, and the London parks were ablaze with sunlit trees turning gently orange. It was 1978. That means we are now into the 22nd consecutive shocker. </p> <p>This is a time of year foreigners do vastly better than the British. The forecast is 70 and sunny in Casablanca and Cairo, where no sane person would go in August. They are still having lunch outside in much of France. And the Americans, whose summer can be pretty bloody, get this time of year spot on. Their typical fall day is cloudless and sparkling, and the calendar moves rapidly from event to event: the baseball season ends just in time for Halloween. Then it is Thanksgiving, followed by a brief and manageable festive season. </p> <p>We have nothing except the declining annual damnation of Guy Fawkes (presumably people will no longer give a penny for the guy for fear that children will not in fact spend money on fireworks to blind each other but hand it over to Romanian beggars). This is followed by the seven-week period characterised by the traditional greeting: \"We won't be able to do it this side of Christmas, guv.\" </p> <p>October might have been unpleasant, but the worst month of all starts tomorrow: not merely cold, wet and windy but dark at teatime as well. There are those who claim that February is worse than November. But they are out of date. February is mercifully short, anyway. It is optimistic too, with the days lengthening and the first hint of spring wafting in on the southerly breezes. And climate change has had its effect: daffodils are now in bloom all month in London in February. </p> <p> November offers nothing, not even much decent sport on telly. The time has come to take action. It occurs to me that 2002 is the 250th anniversary of the introduction of the Gregorian calendar. We should mark the occasion by abolishing this most useless of months. </p> <p>Now I recognise there are issues involving the rotation of the earth round the sun, which will take longer to alter (though, as with the climate, humanity is probably starting to do just that). The main purpose of the change would be psychological. </p> <p>Henceforth, most British months would have 33 days, with 32 in February (except in a leap year) and 34 for June, July and August. This would be easier to understand than the current system, and more agreeable. We would skip lightly from summer into September. After that we would just have to endure a couple of extra October days - then it would almost be Christmas. </p> <p>There would be some minor disruption. But it is an insignificant time for most farmers and gardeners. And, although some birthdays would have to be shifted, I am assured this mainly affects Scorpios, and people who dabble in such matters tend to be snotty about Scorpios. </p> <p>We could remember, remember the 5th of October. Or the 5th of December. The lord mayor's show would have to be moved. But we all know what comes after that: the state opening of parliament. There seems to be general confusion about that date anyway, so it might be postponed until well into the New Year, forcing the Commons to do less, to general approval. </p> <p>In short, the gains would far outweigh the losses. And when our grandchildren puzzle over dates in the olden days, we can quote Thomas Hood at them so they know they are missing nothing: </p> <p>No warmth, no cheerfulness, no healthful ease! <br> No comfortable feel in any member - <br> No shade, no shine, no butterflies, no bees, <br> No fruits, no flowers, no leaves, no birds - <br> November! </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:matthewengel@ndirect.co.uk\">matthewengel@ndirect.co.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Autumn has generally got a pretty good press from English poets: \"There is a harmony in autumn, and a lustre in the sky\"; \"Oh, good gigantic smile o' the brown old earth, this autumn morning\"; \"Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness\". It is the same in children's story books. The autumnal illustrations always show happy little girls in thin macs and light-duty wellies scrunching their way through dry piles of leaves. What bilge. October has been a disgusting month throughout, even before this weekend, which provided the most sustained outburst of wind and rain I can remember. It was extra-long too, because of the clocks going back. When a walk was vaguely suggested, even the dog adopted an expression of total contempt. And so far we've been lucky out our way. The thought of spending a stormy night barred from entry to Dover harbour terrifies me even more than the notion of going on a British train. Anywhere. Ever. But it is always like this. In some distant vault of memory, I do recall an autumn that had a lustre in the sky and a gigantic smile. I can date it from where I was living, and the records back me up. Indian summer lingered for ages, and the London parks were ablaze with sunlit trees turning gently orange. It was 1978. That means we are now into the 22nd consecutive shocker. This is a time of year foreigners do vastly better than the British. The forecast is 70 and sunny in Casablanca and Cairo, where no sane person would go in August. They are still having lunch outside in much of France. And the Americans, whose summer can be pretty bloody, get this time of year spot on. Their typical fall day is cloudless and sparkling, and the calendar moves rapidly from event to event: the baseball season ends just in time for Halloween. Then it is Thanksgiving, followed by a brief and manageable festive season. We have nothing except the declining annual damnation of Guy Fawkes (presumably people will no longer give a penny for the guy for fear that children will not in fact spend money on fireworks to blind each other but hand it over to Romanian beggars). This is followed by the seven-week period characterised by the traditional greeting: \"We won't be able to do it this side of Christmas, guv.\" October might have been unpleasant, but the worst month of all starts tomorrow: not merely cold, wet and windy but dark at teatime as well. There are those who claim that February is worse than November. But they are out of date. February is mercifully short, anyway. It is optimistic too, with the days lengthening and the first hint of spring wafting in on the southerly breezes. And climate change has had its effect: daffodils are now in bloom all month in London in February. November offers nothing, not even much decent sport on telly. The time has come to take action. It occurs to me that 2002 is the 250th anniversary of the introduction of the Gregorian calendar. We should mark the occasion by abolishing this most useless of months. Now I recognise there are issues involving the rotation of the earth round the sun, which will take longer to alter (though, as with the climate, humanity is probably starting to do just that). The main purpose of the change would be psychological. Henceforth, most British months would have 33 days, with 32 in February (except in a leap year) and 34 for June, July and August. This would be easier to understand than the current system, and more agreeable. We would skip lightly from summer into September. After that we would just have to endure a couple of extra October days - then it would almost be Christmas. There would be some minor disruption. But it is an insignificant time for most farmers and gardeners. And, although some birthdays would have to be shifted, I am assured this mainly affects Scorpios, and people who dabble in such matters tend to be snotty about Scorpios. We could remember, remember the 5th of October. Or the 5th of December. The lord mayor's show would have to be moved. But we all know what comes after that: the state opening of parliament. There seems to be general confusion about that date anyway, so it might be postponed until well into the New Year, forcing the Commons to do less, to general approval. In short, the gains would far outweigh the losses. And when our grandchildren puzzle over dates in the olden days, we can quote Thomas Hood at them so they know they are missing nothing: No warmth, no cheerfulness, no healthful ease! No comfortable feel in any member - No shade, no shine, no butterflies, no bees, No fruits, no flowers, no leaves, no birds - November! matthewengel@ndirect.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>Within two weeks the question may arise: who runs Britain? The chancellor prepares his pre-budget statement against the louring threat of a national breakdown. Hauliers, with farmers at their side, presume to insist that he should grant them a large cut in fuel duty or face the consequences they imposed in September. This extraordinary state of affairs is given respectability by ceaseless repetition, especially on the BBC. November 13 has acquired awesome legitimacy. It is the expiry date of the 60-day permit the protesters graciously allotted the government to carry on running the country, prior to resuming their blockades if ministers do not submit to the hauliers' demands.</p> <p>When the September events unfolded, the government did not know what to do. It was quite unprepared. Mr Blair was affronted and confused. Temporarily, he lost a lot of public support for the sound reason that he, as national leader, had not ensured that people could lead their normal lives. This time, if the hauliers unite to inflict another burst of direct action, the government will not be unprepared. A lot of talking has been done, with the police, the army and the oil companies, to insure against the worst consequences of haulier hubris. But the problem for ministers is worse than that. They face, in bewilderment, a modern crisis of the governing class.</p> <p>The trivial aspect of this crisis comes from technology. Mobile telephones bring disparate protesters together fast and in secret, which makes them harder to counter. There is no Arthur Scargill to demonise or treat with. Small, scattered groups which have never met are able to scheme for a common purpose, sometimes a good one. Against the subversive internet, the instruments of government lumber vainly to keep up.</p> <p>More serious for politicians is the mercurial condition of the public mind, which seems to mirror this new fluidity. What mattered in September was the willingness of the general British public to back the protest. This may have been primarily a gesture of self-interest: everybody would like lower petrol prices. And it would have begun to wither quickly once hospitals and other emergency services became terminal victims of the hauliers' callous selfishness.</p> <p>But at a deeper level, the public showed little respect for the people they pay to defend their common interest and the society in which they live. They were unimpressed by Mr Blair's appeals. They did not instinctively back him against either the blatantly illegal impositions of the hauliers or the oil companies' combination of greed and cowardice. In the showdown, the man whose party they had elected into government by a massive majority was treated with less sympathy than a bunch of sullen, bullying whingers, parked comfortably outside petrol depots watching the country grind to a halt.</p> <p>Here we see the price of the contempt into which the trade of politics has fallen. Where are these people when you need them? Mired in bogs of ridicule and mistrust, to which they have been dispatched by their own actions and by our exaggerations of their iniquity. Every time they mislead, they stack the store of disbelief. Every time they take shady political money, they seem to be on the make for their parties, not the country. Every time they shade the facts to suit themselves, they replenish scepticism. They don't always deserve this. But when a prime minister cannot secure public support for the defence of the realm against the force of a tiny group of commercially motivated men, something corrosive has happened to democracy.</p> <p>It is cynical and perverse, however, to use this evidence against Blair. To show that democratic assent is compromised is not a good reason for saying that those who compromise it are worth defending. That is what both the Conservative party and its media backers did in September. The collapse of faith in politicians is the most striking, and arguably the most disturbing, phenomenon in public life. But the coming trial of strength in Britain should be the occasion for destroying the specious arguments that support it, not sneakily reinforcing them.</p> <p>The most common, pleaded by the Daily Telegraph, is that Britain is \"no longer a properly functioning parliamentary democracy\". That is apparently enough to justify any group using direct action to secure its aims. It is poisonous nonsense. What it means is that Labour is in power with a majority that can get its way, to the displeasure of the Daily Telegraph. Mr Blair may have handled this situation with a certain insensitivity, failing to show up very often himself, and driving his legislation through as fast as the House of Lords will let him.</p> <p>But parliamentary democracy is functioning no better and no worse than when the Thatcher government drove through the poll tax. Justifying the fuel protests by reference to Labour's unshakeable majority is a singularly perverted way of defending the British system of government.</p> <p>Under that system - does one really have to say this? - the government holds the ring between competing interests, and makes a compromise between them. No one else can do this. No one else can defend weak interest groups against strong ones or the peaceful against the violent. It is sophistry to pretend that direct action by the hauliers is designed to do anything other than violence to society. Only government can defend society against its enemies, among whom the People's Fuel Lobby and Farmers for Action, with their air of creepy righteousness and triumphalist menace, should certainly be counted. If government is denied the right and duty to do that, we deliver ourselves into the hands of the biggest bully.</p> <p>Only government can determine what the level of fuel duty should be. The cost of driving lorries is higher here than in many countries, though less so if all business taxes are taken into account. Striking the balance between fiscal needs, environmental factors and political necessity is what we elect governments to do. They have to listen to every kind of request and complaint. As Jack Straw admitted yesterday, governments are giving in to pressure all the time. When Gordon Brown has finished his pre-budget calculations, it will be surprising if his intensive conversations with the road haulage industry don't yield a change in the licensing and/or tax arrangements that give it comfort.</p> <p>For some people, though, it won't be enough. They've got the bit between their voracious teeth. They evidently enjoy the power the political discourse currently assigns them. We approach a moment of truth. Either they can continue to be called fine upright citizens, for whom William Hague has nothing but respect. This will be the temptation of newspapers that have become viciously anti-Labour in the last six months. Alternatively the protest can be seen for what it is: an attempt, by ruthless little men, to exploit the vulnerability of modern societies and the weakness of their politics. It seems important that this time the public understand which side it should be on.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p>",

It is the expiry date of the 60-day permit the protesters graciously allotted the government to carry on running the country, prior to resuming their blockades if ministers do not submit to the hauliers' demands. When the September events unfolded, the government did not know what to do. It was quite unprepared. Mr Blair was affronted and confused. Temporarily, he lost a lot of public support for the sound reason that he, as national leader, had not ensured that people could lead their normal lives. This time, if the hauliers unite to inflict another burst of direct action, the government will not be unprepared. A lot of talking has been done, with the police, the army and the oil companies, to insure against the worst consequences of haulier hubris. But the problem for ministers is worse than that. They face, in bewilderment, a modern crisis of the governing class. The trivial aspect of this crisis comes from technology. Mobile telephones bring disparate protesters together fast and in secret, which makes them harder to counter. There is no Arthur Scargill to demonise or treat with. Small, scattered groups which have never met are able to scheme for a common purpose, sometimes a good one. Against the subversive internet, the instruments of government lumber vainly to keep up. More serious for politicians is the mercurial condition of the public mind, which seems to mirror this new fluidity. What mattered in September was the willingness of the general British public to back the protest. This may have been primarily a gesture of self-interest: everybody would like lower petrol prices. And it would have begun to wither quickly once hospitals and other emergency services became terminal victims of the hauliers' callous selfishness. But at a deeper level, the public showed little respect for the people they pay to defend their common interest and the society in which they live. They were unimpressed by Mr Blair's appeals. They did not instinctively back him against either the blatantly illegal impositions of the hauliers or the oil companies' combination of greed and cowardice. In the showdown, the man whose party they had elected into government by a massive majority was treated with less sympathy than a bunch of sullen, bullying whingers, parked comfortably outside petrol depots watching the country grind to a halt. Here we see the price of the contempt into which the trade of politics has fallen. Where are these people when you need them? Mired in bogs of ridicule and mistrust, to which they have been dispatched by their own actions and by our exaggerations of their iniquity. Every time they mislead, they stack the store of disbelief. Every time they take shady political money, they seem to be on the make for their parties, not the country. Every time they shade the facts to suit themselves, they replenish scepticism. They don't always deserve this. But when a prime minister cannot secure public support for the defence of the realm against the force of a tiny group of commercially motivated men, something corrosive has happened to democracy. It is cynical and perverse, however, to use this evidence against Blair. To show that democratic assent is compromised is not a good reason for saying that those who compromise it are worth defending. That is what both the Conservative party and its media backers did in September. The collapse of faith in politicians is the most striking, and arguably the most disturbing, phenomenon in public life. But the coming trial of strength in Britain should be the occasion for destroying the specious arguments that support it, not sneakily reinforcing them. The most common, pleaded by the Daily Telegraph, is that Britain is \"no longer a properly functioning parliamentary democracy\". That is apparently enough to justify any group using direct action to secure its aims. It is poisonous nonsense. What it means is that Labour is in power with a majority that can get its way, to the displeasure of the Daily Telegraph. Mr Blair may have handled this situation with a certain insensitivity, failing to show up very often himself, and driving his legislation through as fast as the House of Lords will let him. But parliamentary democracy is functioning no better and no worse than when the Thatcher government drove through the poll tax. Justifying the fuel protests by reference to Labour's unshakeable majority is a singularly perverted way of defending the British system of government. Under that system - does one really have to say this? - the government holds the ring between competing interests, and makes a compromise between them. No one else can do this. No one else can defend weak interest groups against strong ones or the peaceful against the violent. It is sophistry to pretend that direct action by the hauliers is designed to do anything other than violence to society. Only government can defend society against its enemies, among whom the People's Fuel Lobby and Farmers for Action, with their air of creepy righteousness and triumphalist menace, should certainly be counted. If government is denied the right and duty to do that, we deliver ourselves into the hands of the biggest bully. Only government can determine what the level of fuel duty should be. The cost of driving lorries is higher here than in many countries, though less so if all business taxes are taken into account. Striking the balance between fiscal needs, environmental factors and political necessity is what we elect governments to do. They have to listen to every kind of request and complaint. As Jack Straw admitted yesterday, governments are giving in to pressure all the time. When Gordon Brown has finished his pre-budget calculations, it will be surprising if his intensive conversations with the road haulage industry don't yield a change in the licensing and/or tax arrangements that give it comfort. For some people, though, it won't be enough. They've got the bit between their voracious teeth. They evidently enjoy the power the political discourse currently assigns them. We approach a moment of truth. Either they can continue to be called fine upright citizens, for whom William Hague has nothing but respect. This will be the temptation of newspapers that have become viciously anti-Labour in the last six months. Alternatively the protest can be seen for what it is: an attempt, by ruthless little men, to exploit the vulnerability of modern societies and the weakness of their politics. It seems important that this time the public understand which side it should be on. hugoyoung@compuserve.com",

It's just one of those things,\" said the Met Office. \"There is no real scientific answer for what starts that spinning rotation as yet.\" There is a report, from the US, of a cottage being lifted into the air by a tornado and dropped into a lake, along with its two inhabitants. Although tornadoes have swept across towns and villages in Britain - in Selsey in 1998, one damaged the telescopes of the astronomer, Patrick Moore - reports of damage are rare, and the tornadoes themselves are shortlived. The worst recorded in the United States was on March 18, 1925, when a tornado sped across Missouri, Illinois and Indiana, killing 695 and injuring 2,027.",

They couldn't, reasoned the unimpressed impresario, relate to the grouchy protagonist of <strong> One Foot In The Grave</strong> (BBC1), never mind reconcile the absurd nature of the aforementioned events with their own lives.

David Renwick's considerable achievement with this episode is that he foregrounds the process of writing, creating a classy example of meta-sitcom - Italo Calvino meets Molly Sugden - as he again conveys the weirdness of ordinary life in all its glory and how we - and I think it is a particularly British thing - react to that nonsense. It may be magnified but there is a mote of truth there nonetheless. There is a little Victor Meldrew in all of us. </p> <p> <strong> Equinox: The Science Of Stress</strong> (Channel 4) was an illuminating, scary, and resonant exploration of the subject. My Sunday night, for example, wasn't what I would call a blast. Having avoided being splattered on the runway at London City Airport, the plane I was on landed at Stansted where it sat on the runway for some 30 minutes. After another 20 minutes on a bus waiting to enter the terminal \"because there was no one to open the terminal door\", it was onto another bus to Liverpool Street. We, the paying passengers, couldn't take bags onto the bus \"because the driver didn't want us to\", and if we did, we could \"get another bus\". The lady from Stansted Airport didn't caution the driver that this was no way to speak to people and instead positively encouraged him by saying he was \"doing her a favour\" by letting us on his bus. Curious, since it looked like he was just doing his job, but there you go. And then there was the drive to London complete with pumping UK garage soundtrack. The people you meet when you don't have a gun. </p> <p>According to Equinox, lack of control over one's situation, perinatal factors, the method of one's delivery into the world, and new technology all factor in our stress levels, though no one component is as important as the way we handle stress. In that respect, there is a big Victor Meldrew within some of us. </p> <p>What better way to unwind than watching <strong> Tweenies</strong> (BBC2)? Pretty much any other way you can imagine, actually. Muppet-ish characters with tiny hands and enormous feet, giant red dogs (that talk), a purple spongy woman called Judy who started explaining similes, and a clock that wasn't a clock at all, Tweenies is like the hallucination sequences in Jacob's Ladder. I wouldn't be surprised if Tim Robbins is lying comatose in their bathroom. </p> <p>The gang - Bella, Milo, Jake and Fist (I may have misheard that last one) - consulted their weird clock-not-clock and lo, it was time for a singsong. This Old Man (He Played One) was their choice of chorus and it was all fine - drums, shoes, knees, doors - until they reached five, at which point this old man, he played knick-knack on \"my hive\". Only it wasn't a hive at all. Or even hives (which, covered in all that man-made fibre, may be plentiful on the people inside the Tweeny costumes). It was a vase. A blue vase. I think that's asking too much of the audience to imagine a blue vase as a beehive, don't you? Even with the buzzing noises Fist and her less aggressively-named chums were making. Couldn't they have picked a cream vase or, even better, a Habitat lampshade that at least resembled a hive? Should the Tweenies be encouraging children to pick up beehives and play knick-knack on them in the first place? That's how accidents happen. And if that weren't enough to make you yodel, this old man died at seven (playing knick-knack up to heaven) only to return to earth for eight, nine and ten (gates, lines and hens respectively). No wonder children are confused.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Scores of householders were evacuated across southern Britain and thousands of homes plunged into darkness as fallen trees severed power lines. The environment agency issued eight severe flood warnings in south-east England.</p> <p>Rough seas stranded 6,000 ferry passengers off the Kent coast overnight and the port of Dover closed for the day. </p> <p>Amid gusts exceeding 85mph, four passenger ships from Calais and two freight carriers from Zeebrugge were redirected to Deal. Graham Munslow, 37, from Epsom, Surrey, who was stranded on the Pride of Dover for 14 hours, said the journey was a \"fairground ride\". \"When you walked into the coffee bar all the chairs were sliding to and fro because the floors were slippery because of spilled liquid.\" </p> <p>Kate Rowson, 27, from Maida Vale, London, said: \"There was cutlery flying and glass smashing all over the place.\" </p> <p>In East Sussex, the towns of Lewes and Uckfield were placed on alert and warned that they faced a repeat of the devastating floods of two weeks ago. In Kent, the river Medway in Maidstone burst its banks. </p> <p>Train services to London were reduced to a trickle and large sections of the M25 around London were closed, while other main roads were reduced to a crawl. </p> <p>In south London, a 31-year-old man, Richard Clark, was killed on Sunday night when his car hit surface water and skidded into a parked car and then a bus. </p> <p>Hundreds of trees fell across the south-east, blocking roads and wrecking cars. About 13,000 homes suffered power cuts. </p> <p><strong> South-west</strong><br> </p> <p> Environment agency officials and emergency services breathed a sigh of relief last night after the centre of Taunton was spared a repetition of floods from the river Tone that hit the Somerset town 40 years ago this month. \"We came within an inch of a repetition of 1960, with the highest river levels in 40 years,\" an environment agency spokesman said. But with more rain and high tides expected, severe flood warnings remained in force on the Tone and other rivers, including the Avon between Malmesbury and Bristol. </p> <p>The storms forced the cancellation of trains across the region, resulting in atrocious road conditions. Two lanes of the M5 motorway near Bristol had to be closed because of flooding. In Devon, dozens of roads were closed by fallen trees or landslips. \"It has been chaos on roads,\" said a spokesman for Avon and Somerset police, warning motorists not to drive unless they have to. \"Roads are littered with debris and there is a lot of surface water.\" </p> <p>Power lines brought down by gale force winds left 25,000 customers without electricity from Redruth and Bodmin in Cornwall to Crewkerne in Somerset. </p> <p><strong> East Anglia</strong><br> </p> <p> Lifeboats were standing by 30 miles inland yesterday after floods in Essex left many homes five feet under water. The river Lea at Waltham Abbey burst its banks, flooding hundreds of homes in the town and nearby villages. Commuter villages like Nazeing and Thornwood were completely cut off and commuters found rail services cancelled after falling trees brought down power lines. </p> <p>Around 13,000 households in Essex suffered power cuts and 64 schools were closed because of blocked roads. More than 50,000 householders across East Anglia suffered power cuts. </p> <p>High winds were blamed for the death of a lorry driver after a van was blown into the path of his vehicle on the A17 at Kirkby la Thorpe, in Lincolnshire. A taxi driver was injured when a tree fell on his cab outside Brentwood, Essex. </p> <p><strong> Wales</strong><br> </p> <p> Torrential rain and winds gusting up to 97mph brought chaos across Wales, halting rail traffic, forcing schools to close and leaving thousands of homes without electricity. Homes and businesses in the town of Ruthin were flooded for the third time in seven years when the river Clwyd burst its banks, while in mid-Wales a couple had to be rescued from the upstairs of their cottage by boat after becoming trapped by the rising water. </p> <p>Severe flood warnings remained in place last night on the rivers Wye, Usk, Ely and Monnow in south-east Wales and on the river Vyrnwy in mid-Wales. </p> <p>Power workers battled throughout the day to restore supplies to 30,000 customers in the Carmarthenshire, Swansea and Brecon areas. </p> <p><strong> Midlands</strong><br> </p> <p> Falling trees and floods brought chaos to much of the Midlands, cutting more than 15 major roads. </p> <p>Sixty rail commuters escaped a near catastrophe by seconds in West Bromwich when two trees fell on to the track and electric cables, and then a third tree struck the end of the 8.30am train for Birmingham. Shaken passengers were taken to safety through nearby residents' gardens amid showers of sparks. </p> <p>A historic oak tree at Boscobel House, near Wolverhampton, where Charles II hid after losing the battle of Worcester in 1651, was another victim of gusts of up to 90mph. The tree, an offshoot of the one in which the fleeing king is said to have clambered, is not expected to recover. </p> <p>Snow from the north reached as far as Stoke-on-Trent, where dozens of roads were also blocked by trees and branches. The M42 link between the M1 and M6 motorways, one of the busiest commuter routes, was described as \"horrendous\". </p> <p>All rail services in the morning were cancelled by Central Trains and Midland Mainline and all Virgin services on the west coast main line were suspended, severing links between Birmingham and London southwards and Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow to the north. </p> <p>A 28-year-old is thought to have drowned last night in the swollen river Nene at Northampton after jumping in to try to save a woman's dog. </p> <p><strong> North-west</strong><br> </p> <p> People woke yesterday to what the Met Office called \"large lumps of very thick, sticky, wet, snow\" which quickly turned to rain, less than that in the south but enough to cause floods and power cuts. </p> <p>More than 2,000 children in Merseyside and Cheshire were sent home from school because of serious flooding. The environment agency issued flood warnings on five rivers including the Ribble at Ribch ester, where several homes and car parks were under water. The most severe warning was for the river Douglas in Wigan. </p> <p>Around 5,000 homes and businesses suffered power cuts across Merseyside, Cheshire and north Wales because of flying branches hitting electricity wires.

      "bodyText": "Scores of householders were evacuated across southern Britain and thousands of homes plunged into darkness as fallen trees severed power lines. The environment agency issued eight severe flood warnings in south-east England. Rough seas stranded 6,000 ferry passengers off the Kent coast overnight and the port of Dover closed for the day. Amid gusts exceeding 85mph, four passenger ships from Calais and two freight carriers from Zeebrugge were redirected to Deal. Graham Munslow, 37, from Epsom, Surrey, who was stranded on the Pride of Dover for 14 hours, said the journey was a \"fairground ride\". \"When you walked into the coffee bar all the chairs were sliding to and fro because the floors were slippery because of spilled liquid.\" Kate Rowson, 27, from Maida Vale, London, said: \"There was cutlery flying and glass smashing all over the place.\" In East Sussex, the towns of Lewes and Uckfield were placed on alert and warned that they faced a repeat of the devastating floods of two weeks ago. In Kent, the river Medway in Maidstone burst its banks. Train services to London were reduced to a trickle and large sections of the M25 around London were closed, while other main roads were reduced to a crawl. In south London, a 31-year-old man, Richard Clark, was killed on Sunday night when his car hit surface water and skidded into a parked car and then a bus. Hundreds of trees fell across the south-east, blocking roads and wrecking cars. About 13,000 homes suffered power cuts. South-west Environment agency officials and emergency services breathed a sigh of relief last night after the centre of Taunton was spared a repetition of floods from the river Tone that hit the Somerset town 40 years ago this month. \"We came within an inch of a repetition of 1960, with the highest river levels in 40 years,\" an environment agency spokesman said. But with more rain and high tides expected, severe flood warnings remained in force on the Tone and other rivers, including the Avon between Malmesbury and Bristol. The storms forced the cancellation of trains across the region, resulting in atrocious road conditions. Two lanes of the M5 motorway near Bristol had to be closed because of flooding. In Devon, dozens of roads were closed by fallen trees or landslips. \"It has been chaos on roads,\" said a spokesman for Avon and Somerset police, warning motorists not to drive unless they have to. \"Roads are littered with debris and there is a lot of surface water.\" Power lines brought down by gale force winds left 25,000 customers without electricity from Redruth and Bodmin in Cornwall to Crewkerne in Somerset. East Anglia Lifeboats were standing by 30 miles inland yesterday after floods in Essex left many homes five feet under water. The river Lea at Waltham Abbey burst its banks, flooding hundreds of homes in the town and nearby villages. Commuter villages like Nazeing and Thornwood were completely cut off and commuters found rail services cancelled after falling trees brought down power lines. Around 13,000 households in Essex suffered power cuts and 64 schools were closed because of blocked roads. More than 50,000 householders across East Anglia suffered power cuts. High winds were blamed for the death of a lorry driver after a van was blown into the path of his vehicle on the A17 at Kirkby la Thorpe, in Lincolnshire. A taxi driver was injured when a tree fell on his cab outside Brentwood, Essex. Wales Torrential rain and winds gusting up to 97mph brought chaos across Wales, halting rail traffic, forcing schools to close and leaving thousands of homes without electricity. Homes and businesses in the town of Ruthin were flooded for the third time in seven years when the river Clwyd burst its banks, while in mid-Wales a couple had to be rescued from the upstairs of their cottage by boat after becoming trapped by the rising water. Severe flood warnings remained in place last night on the rivers Wye, Usk, Ely and Monnow in south-east Wales and on the river Vyrnwy in mid-Wales. Power workers battled throughout the day to restore supplies to 30,000 customers in the Carmarthenshire, Swansea and Brecon areas. Midlands Falling trees and floods brought chaos to much of the Midlands, cutting more than 15 major roads. Sixty rail commuters escaped a near catastrophe by seconds in West Bromwich when two trees fell on to the track and electric cables, and then a third tree struck the end of the 8.30am train for Birmingham. Shaken passengers were taken to safety through nearby residents' gardens amid showers of sparks. A historic oak tree at Boscobel House, near Wolverhampton, where Charles II hid after losing the battle of Worcester in 1651, was another victim of gusts of up to 90mph. The tree, an offshoot of the one in which the fleeing king is said to have clambered, is not expected to recover. Snow from the north reached as far as Stoke-on-Trent, where dozens of roads were also blocked by trees and branches. The M42 link between the M1 and M6 motorways, one of the busiest commuter routes, was described as \"horrendous\". All rail services in the morning were cancelled by Central Trains and Midland Mainline and all Virgin services on the west coast main line were suspended, severing links between Birmingham and London southwards and Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow to the north. A 28-year-old is thought to have drowned last night in the swollen river Nene at Northampton after jumping in to try to save a woman's dog. North-west People woke yesterday to what the Met Office called \"large lumps of very thick, sticky, wet, snow\" which quickly turned to rain, less than that in the south but enough to cause floods and power cuts. More than 2,000 children in Merseyside and Cheshire were sent home from school because of serious flooding. The environment agency issued flood warnings on five rivers including the Ribble at Ribch ester, where several homes and car parks were under water. The most severe warning was for the river Douglas in Wigan. Around 5,000 homes and businesses suffered power cuts across Merseyside, Cheshire and north Wales because of flying branches hitting electricity wires. Some homes were without power all day. Manchester airport absorbed around 5,000 extra passengers on 22 flights diverted from Heathrow, Gatwick, Cardiff and Paris, causing crowding and delaying regular departures. A spokeswoman said staff were doing their best to get hundreds of passengers to their destinations by coach, but the roads were congested because of train cancellations. AA Roadwatch in Manchester said around 30 roads in Lancashire were closed due to flooding. A spokesman said: \"I've never seen it that bad.\" Worst hit was the M6. On the A562, one car was stranded with water up to its windows. In Lancashire, 80% of trains were cancelled after a landslide blocked the line between Preston and Lancaster. North-east Blizzards struck at the height of the morning rush-hour in Yorkshire, gridlocking Leeds and Bradford for almost two hours. The snow coincided with widespread flash floods across the region as an all-night downpour turned roads into lakes. Much of Yorkshire and the north-east was also cut off for the morning by crawling traffic on the trans-Pennine routes and the closure of the east coast main line. Great North Eastern cancelled all services between Scotland, the north-east and Yorkshire and London after gales wrecked overhead power lines at Peterborough. Police last night stopped drivers entering part of Castleford, where 700 houses and factories, including the Hickson's chemical plant, were partly under water. The Aire broke its banks at Kirkstall in Leeds, the Calder at Hebden bridge and the Wharfe at Pool-in-Wharfedale. By mid-afternoon, 19 flood warnings had been issued between the Tyne and the Trent. Ten major roads closed completely, including the A66 between Carlisle and Darlington. Scotland Although Scotland and Northern Ireland escaped the worst weather, heavy rain brought disruption. GNER cancelled all its services linking Edinburgh to London on the east coast main line and Virgin operated a skeletal service on the west coast main line.

      "bodyText": "Iraq opened another crack in the sanctions regime yesterday by announcing the resumption of commercial flights inside the western imposed no-fly zones on November 5. The transport minister, Ahmed Khalil, said domestic services would operate between Baghdad and Basra, 375 miles to the south, and Mosul, 270 miles to the north. Both destinations lie in the no-fly zones. The US and Britain imposed the no-fly zones in 1991 to protect Kurds in the north and Shia Muslims in the south from possible attack by Iraqi forces. Since then both countries have led Iraq to believe that the ban on flights extended to civilian as well as military aircraft. But yesterday a Foreign Office spokesman said the Iraqi announcement \"doesn't present a problem, because the no-fly zones don't apply to civilian flights\". As recently as last month western diplomatic sources continued to maintain that civilian flights would be an infringement of the zones. The reinterpretation of the no-fly rules follows a study of the legal position commissioned by Iraq five months ago. Last night an Iraqi official told the Guardian: \"When we checked it through lawyers, we found out that there wasn't any prohibition on civilian flights in the areas.\" Officially, the zones are said to be \"derived\" from UN security council resolution 688 - which does not actually mention them - though \"humanitarian necessity\" is also cited as a justification. Iraq is planning to use Ilyushin aircraft for the internal flights. Before the Gulf war, Iraqi Airways flew 15 Boeing airliners of various types and 22 Ilyushin-76s. Most of the aircraft were flown abroad for protection, hours before the war began on January 17 1991. Baghdad has repeatedly asked the UN sanctions committee on Iraq to allow them to be returned.

If the race is close, says Hold Your Vote, then voters in the west must swallow their pride and back Mr Gore. If Mr Gore is winning, they can cast a worry-free vote for Mr Nader.

      "bodyText": "Directors and senior executives of British American Tobacco will be formally questioned this week by Department of Trade and Industry investigators after the government ordered an inquiry into allegations that the corporation orchestrated cigarette smuggling. A three-man Whitehall team descended on the central London head office of the world's second biggest tobacco firm at 9am yesterday to start interviewing key personnel and study hundreds of confidential internal reports after giving the company only a few minutes warning in a telephone call. Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, has the power to pass files to the police, customs or crown prosecution service if the inspectors from his department's company law and investigations directorate discover any evidence of wrongdoing. Mr Byers acted after the Commons health committee recommended an investiga tion following the Guardian's disclosure last January that BAT's own documents revealed how it had secretly condoned tax evasion and exploited widespread smuggling in Latin America and Asia, benefiting from black marketeering on a massive scale. Anti-smoking campaigners applauded the intervention which comes as tobacco firms face action by the European commission and US administration, hailing it as a \"turning point\" in the battle against smuggling, which boosts sales as tax-free cigarettes are sold cheaply, undermining the health and economic policies of governments. BAT said it was disappointed by the decision but pledged to cooperate with the inspectors, who are expected to spend a week in its headquarters before producing a preliminary report early next year. \"We will, of course, cooperate fully with the investigators but will be making no further comments during the course of their work,\" BAT said. Among those certain to be questioned are Ulrich Herter, managing director, and Keith Dunt, finance director, who were named in BAT documents dating up to 1995 published by the Guardian, as well as Martin Broughton, the current chairman. Kenneth Clarke, the former Tory chancellor and health secretary who is now a part-time deputy chairman, may also be quizzed. Mr Clarke made no public comment. Mr Byers appointed the inspectors under section 447 of the Companies Act 1985 and they have the power to order BAT to release documents and provide explanations, backed up by the threat of legal action against a director or executive suspected of being obstructive. Legal experts believe a prosecution in this country for activities abroad is highly unlikely since most of the allegations of smuggling relate to the 1980s and 1990s while the Criminal Justice(Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act, which makes it an offence to conspire to commit crimes outside the European Union, did not come into force until September 1999.",

      "bodyText": "Bloodshed returned to the heart of Arab East Jerusalem yesterday when an Israeli security guard was shot dead, tightening the siege of the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, as he faced a hostile opening session of parliament. Two armed guards from a private firm were shot in the head at close range inside a branch of the National Insurance Institute, which is responsible for Israel's social services. The office is less than 100 metres from one of the city's biggest police stations. One man died instantly, the first Jew to be killed in Jerusalem since the uprising began, and the second was seriously wounded. Shopkeepers said a man fired six shots from a handgun before disappearing into the busy lunchtime crowds. The guards did not return fire. The office has not been fully operational for a couple of months because of a strike. It is not normally open on Mondays, adding to the impression that it was a very well planned operation. The attack, and the discovery hours earlier of the bound and stabbed body of an Israeli man in a river bed near a Jewish settlement on the southern fringes of the city, were an unmistakable challenge to Mr Barak. After a month in which more than 140 Palestinians have died in confrontations with Israeli soldiers, the intifada is becoming a guerrilla war. Armed Palestinian cells intend to take their struggle to Arab East Jerusalem, occupied by Israel since 1967 and claimed by the Palestinians as the capital of their unborn state. Mr Barak has never looked weaker. Hours after the killings, at the opening of the winter session of parliament, he was heck led constantly by Israeli Arab members, and by rightwing opponents. One Arab MP held up pictures of Palestinian children killed in the last month and a rightwing MP screamed: \"You are sacrificing your children to be martyrs.\" The unruly scenes drowned out much of Mr Barak's address. \"You will find us united against violence,\" he said. \"Negotiations are conducted around a table, not in the streets and not with shooting and stones. There will be no prize for violence.\" But there was also no sign of unity. Mr Barak sat alone. Labour MPs, including the former prime minister and Nobel Peace Prize winner Shimon Peres, refused to sit beside him, or even make eye contact. Mr Barak was facing a further snub last night when MPs were expected to vote against the prime minister's opening address for the first time in Israel's 52 years. Mr Barak offered no new prescriptions for the crisis, dishing up almost verbatim the cliched mixture of threats, and cajolements to Yasser Arafat to return to the peace process, which has been dead for weeks. Events also appeared to be moving too fast for the Likud party leader, Ariel Sharon, whose visit to the Jerusalem compound housing the al-Aqsa mosque on September 28 ignited Palestinian anger. Yesterday he told parliament he remained open to the idea of joining an emergency government. The Knesset appeared in no mood to listen. Arab MPs screamed back: \"You are the man who lit the match.\" After weeks of negotiation, the prospect of an emergency government being formed was receding yesterday. Mr Barak is calculating that he can keep his minority government afloat with the Shas party, which has promised its support for one month provided he shelves plans for secular reform and bars two leftwing secular parties from the coalition. The conditional reprieve is a meagre consolation for Mr Barak after yesterday's killings in occupied parts of Jerusalem. But even as the battle for Jerusalem arrived on his doorstep, there was no sign of a let-up in the pitched battles that have convulsed the West Bank and Gaza. In Yabed, in the West Bank, 1,000 villagers mourned the death of two young Palestinian brothers, Bilal and Hilal Abu Salah, killed by Israeli soldiers in clashes on Sunday. Bilal, 20, was shot in the head and Hilal, 19, who was found only five metres from where his brother fell, died five hours later from a bullet wound to the throat. In Gaza Israeli tanks shelled stone-throwers near the Egyptian border during widespread clashes in which at least nine Palestinians were injured.

Overall outstanding consumer debt, including home loans, now stands at \u00a3610bn, while unsecured loans have risen to \u00a3115bn. The minister announced the formation of the taskforce following a summit meeting held in London attended by the British Bankers' Association, Council of Mortgage Lenders, the National Consumer Council and others. He said he wanted to see greater transparency on contracts - \"what the percentage rates are, how long the loan will last and what it will mean to the borrower in terms of their personal finances\". Too often, the most important information was buried in the small print. There was also concern about the methods companies use to lure people into taking out their products - NACAB said it had come across cases where companies were offering free products in order to tempt people into signing up. It later emerged that one company highlighted at the meeting was credit card firm Capital One, which has been sending unsolicited letters to people offering them the chance to sign up for a platinum card with a credit limit of up to \u00a325,000.",

Estimates of damage in 1987 were more than \u00a3100m against \u00a3200m this time. Commuters struggled to get to work as train operators cancelled services, and fallen trees and heavy flooding made roads impassable. Tens of thousands of households were left without heat or light as trees brought down power lines, affecting up to 50,000 in East Anglia. A burst water main left 13,000 properties in Exeter without supplies. In North Tawton they wearily began to clear up the mess after the fourth - and worst - flood in 10 months. Even the gloom of a festive flood last Christmas Day could not compare to the daunting sight of these waters, which rose two feet in just half an hour.

The collapse of the Long Term Capital Management hedge fund, which nearly brought the world financial system to a halt in October 1998, had its origins in events in Asia. By 1999 the worse hit economies had made strong recoveries and the IMF proclaimed the end of the crisis. While growth has recovered, markets and currencies throughout the region have taken another bath this year. </p> <p>This time, regional development analysts are trying to convince anyone who will listen that the turmoil is nothing to worry about. The Asian Development Bank, for instance, in its October Asia Recovery Report, put a remarkably bullish spin on a region where equity market capitalisation in local currency levels has fallen by an average of over 30% since the start of the year. </p> <p>\"The magnitude of net capital outflows is nowhere near as large as it was in 1997 and 1998,\" it says. \"The symptoms are the same, but the causes are quite different,\" said Yoshihiro Iwasaki, the head of ADB's regional economic monitoring unit. </p> <p>In the last crisis, a massive inflow of foreign investment put the weak financial systems of the region under strain. This time, investors have been more wary so there is less foreign money to withdraw. Most countries in the region have abandoned pegging their currencies, forcing companies to hedge against the risk of fluctuations in the exchange rate. </p> <p>The trigger for investor nerves this time has been politics rather than economics. The peso has fallen from less than 44 to the US dollar to 51.3 at yesterday's close, thanks to Mr Estrada's involvement in the gambling scandal. Mr Estrada likes to boast that the Philippines is doing better than its neighbours and has recovered much of its losses since 1997. The reality is that its economy did not have so far to fall and is now barely afloat. </p> <p>Indonesia is not far behind. Its currency, the rupiah, was at 8,500 to the dollar 10 weeks ago. Yesterday it fell from 9,035 to 9,410 before firming slightly to 9,325. The central bank advocates intervention but the president, Abdurrahman Wahid, disagrees. Mr Wahid is embroiled in several financial scandals himself, including giving heavily-indebted cronies billions of pounds in debt bailouts. There is growing anti-western sentiment in Indonesia. Many investors have pulled out. </p> <p><strong>Tight controls</strong><br> </p> <p>Malaysia rejected international assistance in 1997 and imposed capital controls instead. The last of these controls were lifted yesterday and a slew of foreign money left for safer climes immediately. No one is predicting what the next few weeks will hold. </p> <p>Thailand is proving to be the nation with its finger in the dyke. While there is nervousness in Bangkok over December's general election and a clear slowdown in economic reform, the baht appears to be holding its own. Dealers say the crucial level is 44 baht to the US dollar. Experts believe that a drop in that level could create problems in Thailand and elsewhere. It closed yesterday at 43.65 with dealer sentiment becoming increasingly negative. </p> <p>Gerard Lyons, head of treasury research at Standard Chartered, says the causes of unease this time are specific to individual countries, and are therefore less likely to lead to a re-run of the last crisis. But he notes that the lesson to be learnt from 1997, is that contagion quickly spreads. \"You can easily be too complacent.\"</p>",

Yesterday it fell from 9,035 to 9,410 before firming slightly to 9,325. The central bank advocates intervention but the president, Abdurrahman Wahid, disagrees. Mr Wahid is embroiled in several financial scandals himself, including giving heavily-indebted cronies billions of pounds in debt bailouts. There is growing anti-western sentiment in Indonesia. Many investors have pulled out. Tight controls Malaysia rejected international assistance in 1997 and imposed capital controls instead. The last of these controls were lifted yesterday and a slew of foreign money left for safer climes immediately. No one is predicting what the next few weeks will hold. Thailand is proving to be the nation with its finger in the dyke. While there is nervousness in Bangkok over December's general election and a clear slowdown in economic reform, the baht appears to be holding its own. Dealers say the crucial level is 44 baht to the US dollar. Experts believe that a drop in that level could create problems in Thailand and elsewhere. It closed yesterday at 43.65 with dealer sentiment becoming increasingly negative. Gerard Lyons, head of treasury research at Standard Chartered, says the causes of unease this time are specific to individual countries, and are therefore less likely to lead to a re-run of the last crisis. But he notes that the lesson to be learnt from 1997, is that contagion quickly spreads. \"You can easily be too complacent.\"",

Mr Bush was the first to hit California, arriving yesterday for rallies in Los Angeles and in the agricultural heartland city of Fresno, where he was joined by his former Republican rival Senator John McCain.

So confident of victory was Mr Gore that he had not visited the state since speaking at the Democratic convention in Los Angeles in August.

Mr Bush will be vying with Mr Clinton in making a special pitch to the large Latino vote in California. Spanish language ads for the Republicans have been shown widely in the state and Mr Bush addressed Latino community leaders in the city of Anaheim by satellite on Sunday. \u0095 Two weeks after her husband died in an air crash, the widow of the Missouri governor and Democratic senatorial candidate Mel Carnahan announced yesterday that she would take up his seat if he is posthumously elected on November 7.

You are losing skilled manpower in which you have put a considerable investment,\" he said. Dr Singhvi, an eminent jurist and Indian MP, has recently been appointed to a new cabinet committee to forge better links between India and its diaspora. He wants Britain and other countries to compensate India for the initial cost of educating skilled workers who then go abroad, in the form of investment in Indian colleges and universities. \"Equity demands that something should be done. The British are well known for their sense of fair play. As things stand India gets a bad bargain,\" he said. But others suggest that the only reason Indians have been successful abroad is because they left in the first place. LK Sharma, the Times of India's veteran London correspondent, points to the example of Har Gobind Khorana, who won the Noble prize for medicine after leaving Indian research facilities for the US. He later decided to become a US citizen. \"The ethos of their new countries has something to do with their achievement,\" Mr Sharma said. 'Life is good. Italians are good people' Razzak Abdu, 33, from Bangladesh, works in a grocery shop in Rome \"I left my home 11 years ago to find a job because in Bangladesh it was impossible, there were so many people. I left my family behind but it was the only way. \"I came to Italy and was lucky. There were far fewer foreigners than there are now. I got papers and was allowed to work legally. For the first few years I stayed with a friend in Rome, before finding my own place. \"He helped me to find a job in a grocery shop and I've been here ever since. I sort out deliveries, stock the shelves, clean, run messages. Usually I work around 12 hours a day, six days a week. It's long, but I like it. \"It was a few years before I spoke good Italian. My wife and two children joined me three years ago. I can make just one visit home a year, and I miss my parents. \"Life is good here. Italians are good people, they have treated me decently, though I have many friends who can't find apartments because they're foreigners. Some day I'd like to open my own shop.\" 'The worst thing is being talked down to' Norma Vitor, 37, took a job as a cleaner after moving from Peru to Spain \"If I had known how hard it was going to be I wouldn't have come. I shouldn't complain - I had enough money and contacts. I've known some who slept out in the streets. \"I'd taken a payoff from the company I worked for in Peru as a secretary. The economy and the politics were bad. I'd seen films about Spain; we spoke the same language. I thought that people would be more welcoming. \"First I flew to Lisbon [in Portugal] and then took the train. I was terrified the police would ask for my papers - I knew they were sending people back. \"I soon found work cleaning. It's a step down but I don't mind. The worst thing is being talked down to. Spanish people can be very harsh. At home they're softer, they have more time. \"Things have worked out. I have my residency permit. I'm even thinking of buying a flat. But the sense of distance is very hard. Without the other Peruvians I wouldn't have survived.\"",

A total of 4.5m shares, priced between SFr85 (\u00a332) and SFr105, will be available in a global offering on November 13 which will see the new venture floated in London, New York, on SWX in Switzerland and the OMX in Sweden. But the plan may still face delays as the US federal trade commission is yet to approve the move, which follows the merger of Novartis and AstraZeneca. The two companies decided to spin-off their crop protection and seeds operations into Syngenta, in order to concentrate on health care. Syngenta also announced yesterday it was selling its corn herbicides business to Dow Chemical for an undisclosed sum. Michael Pragnell, the company's chief executive, refused to disclose further details of the sale which was required by the European Commission as part of its competition review for creating Syngenta. \"The major divestment is acetochlor, which is corn herbicides,\" he said at a news conference in Zurich, adding that further, smaller sales might result from talks currently in progress with potential buyers. Analysts were generally disappointed with the news, saying the valuation was considerably lower than Syngenta had originally expected. The reasons behind the relatively low figure, they suggested, included disenchantment with the specialty chemicals industry and the fact the farm sector was yet to bounce back to prominence. Another City analyst commented Syngenta would find its markets tough over the next year but easing towards 2002. \"There's a feeling it's been tough but is unlikely to get any worse,\" he said. \"Next year is likely to be different with some sort of recovery taking place.\" The flotation plans will see a syndicate led by Credit Suisse First Boston and UBS Warburg will sell up to 4.5m Syngenta shares in the offering.

Several consequences flowed from this fundamental self-delusion. One was that when immigration rose again in the 80s it was dealt with not by a modern immigration act but by bending the asylum laws. Just like apartheid As Mr Schr\u00f6der and the captains of hi-tech industries sat down to their dinner, Christopher Nsoh was drafting an open letter to highlight the grievances of asylum seekers. \"We cannot work. We cannot study. And we cannot travel,\" Mr Nsoh, a lawyer from Cameroon who lives in a hostel in the eastern town of Rathenow, explained. \"If we want to go more than 60 miles outside the boundaries of our Landkreis [borough] then we need permission from the immigration officer. It is just like South Africa before the fall of apartheid.\" To add to their problems, asylum seekers are favourite targets for neo-Nazi skinheads. \"I've tried going out at night three times in Rathenow and I've been assaulted each time,\" Mr Nsoh said. \"[It is] racism on the streets, racism in the institutions and racism in the law.\" The green card initiative has undoubtedly helped to change perceptions. It has made the point that immigrants are a boon, not a burden. At the same time it is helping to sustain the old myth that one day, if circumstances change, the foreigners may all go home and leave Germany to the Germans. The green cardholders, with their five-year work permits, are ultimately modern hi-tech guest workers.",

Studies have shown that people who beg are already committing other crime.\" Suzanne Fitzpatrick, lecturer in housing and social policy at the University of Glasgow, one of the signatories, said: \"Here is incontrovertible proof that people use begging as an alternative to crime.\" Hartley Dean, professor of social policy at, Luton University, said: \"There is persuasive evidence that some at least of those who beg would resort to criminal activities. You don't have to be Einstein to work this one out.\" The latest government campaign builds on the work of the rough sleepers unit which aims to reduce the number of people sleeping on the streets to 620 by 2002. The current figure is said to be 1,200. Charities report that Ms Casey has threatened to withdraw funding from groups which refuse to back the anti-begging drive. One feature of the campaign is the setting up of an \"alternative giving fund\" with collection points in shops and pubs where the public will be invited to donate rather than give directly to beggars. The academics, however, say diverted giving schemes have been shown to be ineffective in their impact on several English towns where they have been tried out.",

Gordon Pollock QC, for Sir Elton, told the high court in London there was concern that the singer's spending habits could be deployed to cause \"a media frenzy\" and put pressure on him. Sir Elton, 53, claims that for more than 10 years he was charged for expenses on his overseas tours that his managing company, John Reid Enterprises Ltd, should have borne. The court heard that the alleged discrepancy in his income came to light only in 1998, when he parted company with his long-time manager and friend, John Reid. Mr Pollock said the problem started when the accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers were finalising accounts of his 1987 North American tour. The firm had taken on the singer's business only a year before the alleged blunder. He said that under a new contract signed in 1986 and dating back to 1984, JREL had increased its commission to 20% of Sir Elton's gross earnings (previously it had been net earnings) on the condition that the managing company took on additional costs. But the team of three accountants failed to implement the change in contract, leaving Sir Elton paying hefty booking fees, travel expenses and accountancy charges while on tour. He has issued a writ against two named defendants, claiming PricewaterhouseCoopers were negligent in not contacting him or his solicitors when initial concerns were noted. Mr Pollock said these concerns were not followed up despite being raised in the original assessment of Sir Elton's accounts. He is also suing his long-term business partner, Andrew Haydon - who managed his subsidiary company, Happenspace Ltd, which oversaw much of his tour business - for breach of contract. A settlement between Sir Elton and Mr Reid of $5m (\u00a33.5m) in compensation was agreed on their parting. Mr Pollock told the court that over 18 years Mr Reid received around \u00a373.5m by way of commission. Sir Elton \"hires people to do these mundane administrative tasks, and he trusted them implicitly,\" Mr Pollock said. \"Mr Haydon effectively ran and was the driving force behind JREL. He received on top of his generous salary a bonus of 5% of the company's commission from Elton John's earnings. \"But the main issue of this case concerns certain costs when Sir Elton goes on tour, costs _ which should have fallen to JREL.\" Mr Pollock told the court that PricewaterhouseCoopers would state that the contract would simply have been rectified if discussed earlier.

(Rostrum, October 24) - so many omissions in your article, so much jumping to conclusions without any fact-checking, so many assumptions quite unsubstantiated by any of the text in the piece by Peter Kingston on South East Essex College (Are you being Served? October 10). As Simmonds said, it was an article on the \"open-plan, learning-centre\" style of internal college architecture that we have developed. \"Students, energised by the mere proximity of other students and assisted by 'learning advisers', work from student-centred materials and the college intranet. The simple removal of walls improves behaviour and boosts performance.\" Absolutely! OK so far. </p> <p>Jean Simmonds claims there are deliberate evasions and omissions. Peter Kingston spent some time in the college talking to staff and students describing what he saw - not simply reading about us and jumping to conclusions based on pre-conceived, outmoded ideas. </p> <p>Jean Simmonds asserts, not having seen it, there is \"a shoddy reality, having more to do with economic imperatives than educational benefits\". </p> <p>Surprising as it may seem to educational reactionaries, the driving imperative is the educational benefit of our complex, interlocking sets of strategies for managing student learning for successful achievement. A reputation for student satisfaction and success is what brings students in to enrol, the younger ones fully supported by their parents in choosing this college. From that derives our general institutional success, which enables us to provide learning environments to smart, professional workplace standards, equipped with a range of educational resources to match modern learning requirements. </p> <p>One strand of these strategies is to work in many large learning centres. These can accommodate many groups, can be staffed with several teachers and additional learning support staff and can be provided with an extensive range of specialised resources. Peter Kingston captured this concept through the \"department store\" analogy. </p> <p>Within large specialist centres, many staff can be deployed to give support to individual students, qualified learning advisers help students to use the hardware and software resources and centre co-ordinators deal with much of the administration. The intranet structures student learning (potentially 24 hours a day), provides asynchronous in-course communications, assignments, deadlines, wider reading and research links and learning materials to a college standard where previously these might have been dictated, copied from the board or put into handouts of variable quality. </p> <p>On top of all this, the teacher is still there, getting on with essential professional tasks; supervising the progress of learners, encouraging, motivating, assessing, providing feedback and ensuring the up-to-date curriculum delivers students' learning objectives. </p> <p>We employ a normal number of teaching staff with a standard average schedule with learners of 21 hours per week; all 350, full-time and part-time, are employed in permanent salaried positions. In addition, we employ 46 academic and learning support staff, 29 learning advisers, 28 centre co-ordinators and 15 staff maintaining network systems. All the above staff are qualified. Most of them have subject-specific degrees. </p> <p>The support we give to students through tutorials and a range of other activities is only possible because of our learning approach - in two successive inspections, we were awarded grade 1 (outstanding). Last year an independent national benchmarking service concluded that the staff/student ratio and student contact hours were considerably higher than average, yet student qualifications outcomes per hour of teaching were the highest they had ever found. </p> <p>We use staff effectively, in multidisciplinary teams and they work with resources (also grade 1 in both inspections) that visitors from numerous colleges and universities have told us they envy. </p> <p>Finally back to the learners. They work in a busy, stimulating, social environment precisely as envisaged by Tim Brighouse (TES, October 20): \"... the number of relationships created by teachers, support learning staff, peer tutors and mentors increase the likelihood of the learner feeling so 'special and unique' that they suspend disbelief and make great learning strides.\"</p>",

Within large specialist centres, many staff can be deployed to give support to individual students, qualified learning advisers help students to use the hardware and software resources and centre co-ordinators deal with much of the administration. The intranet structures student learning (potentially 24 hours a day), provides asynchronous in-course communications, assignments, deadlines, wider reading and research links and learning materials to a college standard where previously these might have been dictated, copied from the board or put into handouts of variable quality. On top of all this, the teacher is still there, getting on with essential professional tasks; supervising the progress of learners, encouraging, motivating, assessing, providing feedback and ensuring the up-to-date curriculum delivers students' learning objectives. We employ a normal number of teaching staff with a standard average schedule with learners of 21 hours per week; all 350, full-time and part-time, are employed in permanent salaried positions. In addition, we employ 46 academic and learning support staff, 29 learning advisers, 28 centre co-ordinators and 15 staff maintaining network systems. All the above staff are qualified. Most of them have subject-specific degrees. The support we give to students through tutorials and a range of other activities is only possible because of our learning approach - in two successive inspections, we were awarded grade 1 (outstanding). Last year an independent national benchmarking service concluded that the staff/student ratio and student contact hours were considerably higher than average, yet student qualifications outcomes per hour of teaching were the highest they had ever found. We use staff effectively, in multidisciplinary teams and they work with resources (also grade 1 in both inspections) that visitors from numerous colleges and universities have told us they envy. Finally back to the learners. They work in a busy, stimulating, social environment precisely as envisaged by Tim Brighouse (TES, October 20): \"... the number of relationships created by teachers, support learning staff, peer tutors and mentors increase the likelihood of the learner feeling so 'special and unique' that they suspend disbelief and make great learning strides.\"",

      "body": "<p>Sixth-form and further-education colleges may be wholeheartedly embracing Curriculum 2000, but not all universities are rushing to endorse the reformed qualifications for young people of 16 to 19. </p> <p>In academic circles there is a growing suspicion that the older \"selecting\" universities are dragging their feet and preferring instead to rely on the traditional three or four A-level entry package. Many fear that this could critically undermine the government's attempt to broaden sixth-form level study. </p> <p>The new Curriculum 2000 changes introduced this term include five key elements: enabling students to study up to five subjects to AS-level before specialising in three or more A2 levels in the second-year sixth; the introduction of vocational A-levels; key skills qualifications in communication, application of number and information technology; and student involvement in enrichment programmes, such as the Duke of Edinburgh's award, sport and citizenship. </p> <p>Bernie Borland, principal of St Francis Xavier Sixth Form College in Clapham, south London, which has 1,100 students studying for more than 30 A-level, AS and advanced vocational courses, argues that the more selective universities, often the redbricks, have been quite muted in their response to Curriculum 2000. </p> <p>\"They have not wished to say anything that goes against the government's intentions,\" he says. \"But they still, I believe, will want three or four good A2 grades related to the area in which the student is going to pursue his or her degree.\" </p> <p>This view is endorsed by Margaret Ingram, deputy principal of Hills Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge, which has 800 students in its lower sixth following a four or five AS-level course with key skills and enrichment activities. She said that there were signs that some universities were being very slow in signalling their support for Curriculum 2000. </p> <p>\"They are playing safe by saying really they will want three good A-levels,\" she said. \"If AS-levels are going to be valued then sooner or later the universities are going to have to take note of them. </p> <p>\"There is also a question mark over whether the universities are going to require key skills as part of the A-level package. I think some of them will and some of them will not, but it would be quite helpful to schools and colleges if they were to say: 'Yes, we would like everybody to have a key skills qualification'.\" </p> <p>Predictably, perhaps, the newer universities, which traditionally have greater problems recruiting students, are higher education's most enthusiastic supporters of Curriculum 2000. But this is not in itself cause for celebration as it merely opens the way for the reintroduction by the back door of the two-tier higher education system that incorporation was designed to abolish. </p> <p>Sally McEnhill, principal of Merton College in west London, which has 650 students doing AS, A-levels and advanced vocational courses, praised the former polytechnics and the newer universities for their involvement in the widening participation agenda by giving Ucas points for key skills and more subjects representing a broader curriculum. But she could see little prospect of improvement while Oxbridge and the red bricks were still insisting on the traditional three A-levels. </p> <p>\"Until the universities really say it is worth having these additional qualifications, we are going to have difficulty in convincing young people that it is worth their while putting that extra effort into the wider curriculum,\" she said, echoing the feelings expressed by principals across the further education sector. </p> <p>\"Some may well start with four or five AS-levels, but how many will keep them up? The sort of students we have will do better through the broader curriculum with the opportunity to review their progress after one year, than they would do on the traditional two-year A-level programme, where a lot of them would drop out.

Which was fantastic because, to paraphrase Eamonn McCabe, The Guardian's picture editor and one of the judges, competitions are about taking risks. </p> <p>But they are also about technical skills, according to his distinguished fellow judge, Paul Wombell, director of The Photographers' Gallery in London, where the 12 winning pictures are now on display. </p> <p>\"As well as a good idea, you have to be able to express it photographically using the language of the medium, and that would mean both using the camera well and making the print well in the dark room.\" </p> <p>The picture judged overall winner is by Vanessa Beard, who is 28 and studying for a BTec national certificate in photography at City of Westminster College. </p> <p>\"It perfectly captures a moment of tension in a training restaurant,\" according to Chris Hughes, third judge and chief executive of the Further Education Development Agency, co-organisers of the competition. </p> <p>In Wombell's opinion, the winner stands out from the field, partly because of its display of technical skill. </p> <p>\"This is somebody thinking about the technology. There's an awareness of the use of flash and how that can be used to represent movement,\" he says. </p> <p>\"It is also very well constructed in terms of the image and how the ele ments are put together\", Wombell says. </p> <p>The judges were also struck by Ruth Saunby's study of a mature student trying to juggle books and parenthood. In Wombell's view, her shot taken from above of a man on his sofa hemmed in by essay-writing paraphernalia clinched a place for Saunby, from South Nottingham College, as \"a good runner-up\". </p> <p>McCabe was impressed by a whimsical series of shots by Hannah Marsh, also at South Nottingham. Her studies show students posing as if for police mugshots, but with the name of their subject rather than a crime number. </p> <p>One of two chief runners-up, Mark Hunt, 34, is also from City of Westminster College - four of the 12 winners come from this stable. He too chose a mature student as his subject, this time a woman. \"A very strong set of pictures,\" is Wombell's verdict. </p> <p>The entries as a whole, he thinks, show lack of technical skill: \"If there's a competition next year, hopefully that would be something participants would give some thought to.\" </p> <p>But McCabe adds: \"I felt the standard was much better than in most competitions from student photographers.\" </p> <p> \u0095 The Photographers' Gallery, Great Newport Street, London WC2, the winners: </p> <p> Vanessa Beard, 28, City of Westminster College, BTec National Certificate in Photography; Andrew Blackburn, 22, Doncaster Art College, National Diploma Photography and Video; Christel Sundeback, 28, City of Westminster College, BTec National Diploma in Photography; Mark Hunt, 34, City of Westminster College, BTec National Diploma in Photography; Ruth Saunby, 24, South Nottingham College, BTec National Diploma in Photography; Katie Reader, 17, South Downs College, A-Level Photography (Art); Maria Kenward, 17, Taunton's College, Southampton, Media Studies, English, Photography;Victoria Hill, 34, City of Westminster College, BTec National Diploma in Photography; Jason Hendley, 30, Solihull Art School, HND Photography; Hannah Marsh, 24, South Nottingham College, BTec National Diploma in Photography; Alison Aram, 19, South Nottingham College, BTec Photography; Andrew Lynch, 32, Doncaster Art College, National Diploma Photography and Video.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was a broad, but simple, theme that we set all you budding photographers who fancied a crack at our competition. We asked you to send us a picture which could bear the title: Student Life - The Reality. And judging from some of the entries, reality for one or two of you is a very foreign land indeed. Which was fantastic because, to paraphrase Eamonn McCabe, The Guardian's picture editor and one of the judges, competitions are about taking risks. But they are also about technical skills, according to his distinguished fellow judge, Paul Wombell, director of The Photographers' Gallery in London, where the 12 winning pictures are now on display. \"As well as a good idea, you have to be able to express it photographically using the language of the medium, and that would mean both using the camera well and making the print well in the dark room.\" The picture judged overall winner is by Vanessa Beard, who is 28 and studying for a BTec national certificate in photography at City of Westminster College. \"It perfectly captures a moment of tension in a training restaurant,\" according to Chris Hughes, third judge and chief executive of the Further Education Development Agency, co-organisers of the competition. In Wombell's opinion, the winner stands out from the field, partly because of its display of technical skill. \"This is somebody thinking about the technology. There's an awareness of the use of flash and how that can be used to represent movement,\" he says. \"It is also very well constructed in terms of the image and how the ele ments are put together\", Wombell says. The judges were also struck by Ruth Saunby's study of a mature student trying to juggle books and parenthood. In Wombell's view, her shot taken from above of a man on his sofa hemmed in by essay-writing paraphernalia clinched a place for Saunby, from South Nottingham College, as \"a good runner-up\". McCabe was impressed by a whimsical series of shots by Hannah Marsh, also at South Nottingham. Her studies show students posing as if for police mugshots, but with the name of their subject rather than a crime number. One of two chief runners-up, Mark Hunt, 34, is also from City of Westminster College - four of the 12 winners come from this stable. He too chose a mature student as his subject, this time a woman. \"A very strong set of pictures,\" is Wombell's verdict. The entries as a whole, he thinks, show lack of technical skill: \"If there's a competition next year, hopefully that would be something participants would give some thought to.\" But McCabe adds: \"I felt the standard was much better than in most competitions from student photographers.\" \u0095 The Photographers' Gallery, Great Newport Street, London WC2, the winners: Vanessa Beard, 28, City of Westminster College, BTec National Certificate in Photography; Andrew Blackburn, 22, Doncaster Art College, National Diploma Photography and Video; Christel Sundeback, 28, City of Westminster College, BTec National Diploma in Photography; Mark Hunt, 34, City of Westminster College, BTec National Diploma in Photography; Ruth Saunby, 24, South Nottingham College, BTec National Diploma in Photography; Katie Reader, 17, South Downs College, A-Level Photography (Art); Maria Kenward, 17, Taunton's College, Southampton, Media Studies, English, Photography;Victoria Hill, 34, City of Westminster College, BTec National Diploma in Photography; Jason Hendley, 30, Solihull Art School, HND Photography; Hannah Marsh, 24, South Nottingham College, BTec National Diploma in Photography; Alison Aram, 19, South Nottingham College, BTec Photography; Andrew Lynch, 32, Doncaster Art College, National Diploma Photography and Video.",

      "byline": "John Crace, with additional reporting by Lee Elliot Major",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Despite the naming and shaming of nearly 30 senior civil servants and eight former Tory ministers in last week's report by Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers over their refusal to recognise the BSE problem, Britain's scientists have largely escaped his censure. For over a decade, it has been a matter of record within the academic community that much of the research on which the government based its pronouncements on the safety of British beef was either wilfully suppressed or misinterpreted by the government, but almost to a man and woman they acquiesced in the perversion. Those who didn't, such as Richard Lacey, were so few in number they could be picked off with ease by government spin doctors as troublemakers. </p> <p>This is the latest example of a more general failure among academics to speak out on important issues, identified by Greg Philo and David Miller in a new book Market Killing. Their main targets are social scientists, but they believe the charge sticks more widely. Many academics must have had more than an inkling that something was amiss with the publication of Professor Sir Richard Southwood's report in 1989. This was the report that set the agenda for the government to declare that BSE was an animal, not human, health problem and all but closed the door on scientific research into the human health risks of infected beef. </p> <p>Sir Richard told one newspaper last week that he was urged to keep his investigation into BSE's impact on the food chain quiet and not to make any recommendations that would involve the government in too much expense. In 1990 he advised the government that further research into \"the remote possibility that humans could be infected\" was necessary. He admitted: \"I did stop eating brain tissue following my research.\" </p> <p>And yet academics knew that Southwood's committee contained no experts on scrapie or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, nor were the available experts in Britain and the US called to give evidence. </p> <p>As Miller, research manager at the Stirling Media Research Institute, wrote in a paper for Social Science and Medicine, \"of those who were called, Hugh Frazer of the Institute for Animal Health is reported to be amazed that he was only asked 'a few simplistic questions' and not for his opinion on other pertinent areas of science\". Back in 1990, Miller conducted his own research into food scandals and was amazed at the duplicity of some of the scientists who were actively engaged in government research in BSE: \"Even though the government was telling the public that British beef was safe to eat, I came across quite a few academics who told me that, based on the scientific evidence, they had concluded beef was unsafe and had stopped eating it,\" he says. \"More worrying still, one very senior scientist, who made a great show of supporting the government line by stating in public that he was happy to carry on eating beef, had actually stopped eating it on health safety grounds.\" </p> <p>Dr Peter Cotgreave, director of the Save British Science Society, claims that the Phillips report highlights the fact that there will have to be changes in the way government deals with scientific advice - and that \"scientific experts have not been given the independence to state their views\". </p> <p>But he concedes: \"When the government was standing up saying there was no risk from BSE, the scientific community should have been standing up and saying that this was not what the scientific evidence actually pointed to,\" he says. \"The advice was that there might be a risk, but we just didn't know for sure.\" </p> <p>Cotgreave says that there are many more strings attached to all kinds of government research grants than in the past. The \u00a3775m of new infrastructure funds announced in the government spending review, for example, come with a caveat that academics must attract 25% of the money from industry. \"That is going to affect the questions they ask,\" he says. </p> <p>A review of physics research in the UK earlier in the year by a group of international experts suggested that UK academics are more willing to just do what the government asks. Similar pressure abroad would start riots in universities. </p> <p>Former government chief scientific adviser Sir Bob May agreed that scientific experts should be more vocal. \"I can see the reasons why people do not get involved. They have given willingly of their time, and then have not been altogether happy with what happened, and are reluctant to give yet more time to make themselves unpopular,\" he said. \"But at the same time I think it is something they should do.\" But Sir Bob says that he is unaware of evidence that academics or scientists withhold results or that research is getting less fundamental: \"If you actually assess the distribution of research council money for fundamental versus applied work, it has moved into the direction of more fundamental work. If you actually count the fraction of papers that are in high-quality, rigorously refereed journals the British share has gone up not down.\" </p> <p>Tim Lang, professor of food policy at Thames Valley University, agrees with Miller that academics did abdicate their responsibilities over the BSE crisis and subjects unpopular with ministers. In an email to Miller he wrote: \"As you know, in the 1980s and 1990s the number of academics who participated in the food-scandals debate was pitifully few. I have been clearing out my archives for the last week and have got all angry again about how few were prepared to research food poverty. Those who did so were giants.\" </p> <p>Academics are ultimately funded by the taxpayer, but are not always the fearless guardians of truth and objectivity they may sometimes claim to be; rather, they are men and women with families and a mortgage who are loath to rock boats for fear of damaging their career prospects. The public interest gets lost. </p> <p>This is perhaps understandable, if not exactly noble. Miller reports on the reaction he got when he announced he was planning to undertake some unpopular research into the effect of the broadcast ban on the IRA in Northern Ireland. \"You could hear the sound of doors shutting,\" he says. </p> <p>The other aspect of this silencing of the lambs is the commercialisation of academic research. In the early 1980s many research bodies were publicly funded; now they are virtual plcs. The effect of this is that most research is either driven by commercial gain - hence the huge amount of money and time spent on finding a cure for hair loss - or by a government agenda, for which money is made available. There is very little independent research taking place and almost nothing to rock the status quo. \"Most academics have effectively given up their role as a critical voice of public policy,\" says Greg Philo, director of the Glasgow Media Group. \"Increasingly it is being left to journalists to ask the difficult questions. Instead, academics are happy either to take the cash from commercial sponsors or to engage in oceans and oceans of non-empirical, intellectually bankrupt, office-based post-modern research where there is no such thing as truth and anything can mean anything. </p> <p>\"Film studies academics have been pursuing inaccurate and pointless research for years, but because they are all doing it, no one challenges them. What's more they all award themselves top ratings at peer review for the Research Assessment Exercise.\" </p> <p>Noam Chomsky, professor of linguistics at Massachussets Institute of Technology, goes along with this. Berating the post-modern trend, he says: \"People are being deprived of valuable modes of understanding and insight they badly need, and crucial questions about how the world works and how it might be changed are avoided, even ridiculed.\" </p> <p>The point about this postmodern research, of course, is that it is cheap and non-controversial - exactly the sort of thing that cash-strapped universities are looking for to boost their research ratings. \"Who is doing the research into the dumbing down of the media,\" asks Greg Philo, \"and the destruction of current affairs programming, the effects of violence in the media and the effects of huge corporations taking over the media? </p> <p>\"There's a similar silence in other areas of public policy. Take the drugs debate.

      "bodyText": "Despite the naming and shaming of nearly 30 senior civil servants and eight former Tory ministers in last week's report by Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers over their refusal to recognise the BSE problem, Britain's scientists have largely escaped his censure. For over a decade, it has been a matter of record within the academic community that much of the research on which the government based its pronouncements on the safety of British beef was either wilfully suppressed or misinterpreted by the government, but almost to a man and woman they acquiesced in the perversion. Those who didn't, such as Richard Lacey, were so few in number they could be picked off with ease by government spin doctors as troublemakers. This is the latest example of a more general failure among academics to speak out on important issues, identified by Greg Philo and David Miller in a new book Market Killing. Their main targets are social scientists, but they believe the charge sticks more widely. Many academics must have had more than an inkling that something was amiss with the publication of Professor Sir Richard Southwood's report in 1989. This was the report that set the agenda for the government to declare that BSE was an animal, not human, health problem and all but closed the door on scientific research into the human health risks of infected beef. Sir Richard told one newspaper last week that he was urged to keep his investigation into BSE's impact on the food chain quiet and not to make any recommendations that would involve the government in too much expense. In 1990 he advised the government that further research into \"the remote possibility that humans could be infected\" was necessary. He admitted: \"I did stop eating brain tissue following my research.\" And yet academics knew that Southwood's committee contained no experts on scrapie or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, nor were the available experts in Britain and the US called to give evidence. As Miller, research manager at the Stirling Media Research Institute, wrote in a paper for Social Science and Medicine, \"of those who were called, Hugh Frazer of the Institute for Animal Health is reported to be amazed that he was only asked 'a few simplistic questions' and not for his opinion on other pertinent areas of science\". Back in 1990, Miller conducted his own research into food scandals and was amazed at the duplicity of some of the scientists who were actively engaged in government research in BSE: \"Even though the government was telling the public that British beef was safe to eat, I came across quite a few academics who told me that, based on the scientific evidence, they had concluded beef was unsafe and had stopped eating it,\" he says. \"More worrying still, one very senior scientist, who made a great show of supporting the government line by stating in public that he was happy to carry on eating beef, had actually stopped eating it on health safety grounds.\" Dr Peter Cotgreave, director of the Save British Science Society, claims that the Phillips report highlights the fact that there will have to be changes in the way government deals with scientific advice - and that \"scientific experts have not been given the independence to state their views\". But he concedes: \"When the government was standing up saying there was no risk from BSE, the scientific community should have been standing up and saying that this was not what the scientific evidence actually pointed to,\" he says. \"The advice was that there might be a risk, but we just didn't know for sure.\" Cotgreave says that there are many more strings attached to all kinds of government research grants than in the past. The \u00a3775m of new infrastructure funds announced in the government spending review, for example, come with a caveat that academics must attract 25% of the money from industry. \"That is going to affect the questions they ask,\" he says. A review of physics research in the UK earlier in the year by a group of international experts suggested that UK academics are more willing to just do what the government asks. Similar pressure abroad would start riots in universities. Former government chief scientific adviser Sir Bob May agreed that scientific experts should be more vocal. \"I can see the reasons why people do not get involved. They have given willingly of their time, and then have not been altogether happy with what happened, and are reluctant to give yet more time to make themselves unpopular,\" he said. \"But at the same time I think it is something they should do.\" But Sir Bob says that he is unaware of evidence that academics or scientists withhold results or that research is getting less fundamental: \"If you actually assess the distribution of research council money for fundamental versus applied work, it has moved into the direction of more fundamental work. If you actually count the fraction of papers that are in high-quality, rigorously refereed journals the British share has gone up not down.\" Tim Lang, professor of food policy at Thames Valley University, agrees with Miller that academics did abdicate their responsibilities over the BSE crisis and subjects unpopular with ministers. In an email to Miller he wrote: \"As you know, in the 1980s and 1990s the number of academics who participated in the food-scandals debate was pitifully few. I have been clearing out my archives for the last week and have got all angry again about how few were prepared to research food poverty. Those who did so were giants.\" Academics are ultimately funded by the taxpayer, but are not always the fearless guardians of truth and objectivity they may sometimes claim to be; rather, they are men and women with families and a mortgage who are loath to rock boats for fear of damaging their career prospects. The public interest gets lost. This is perhaps understandable, if not exactly noble. Miller reports on the reaction he got when he announced he was planning to undertake some unpopular research into the effect of the broadcast ban on the IRA in Northern Ireland. \"You could hear the sound of doors shutting,\" he says. The other aspect of this silencing of the lambs is the commercialisation of academic research. In the early 1980s many research bodies were publicly funded; now they are virtual plcs. The effect of this is that most research is either driven by commercial gain - hence the huge amount of money and time spent on finding a cure for hair loss - or by a government agenda, for which money is made available. There is very little independent research taking place and almost nothing to rock the status quo. \"Most academics have effectively given up their role as a critical voice of public policy,\" says Greg Philo, director of the Glasgow Media Group. \"Increasingly it is being left to journalists to ask the difficult questions. Instead, academics are happy either to take the cash from commercial sponsors or to engage in oceans and oceans of non-empirical, intellectually bankrupt, office-based post-modern research where there is no such thing as truth and anything can mean anything. \"Film studies academics have been pursuing inaccurate and pointless research for years, but because they are all doing it, no one challenges them. What's more they all award themselves top ratings at peer review for the Research Assessment Exercise.\" Noam Chomsky, professor of linguistics at Massachussets Institute of Technology, goes along with this. Berating the post-modern trend, he says: \"People are being deprived of valuable modes of understanding and insight they badly need, and crucial questions about how the world works and how it might be changed are avoided, even ridiculed.\" The point about this postmodern research, of course, is that it is cheap and non-controversial - exactly the sort of thing that cash-strapped universities are looking for to boost their research ratings. \"Who is doing the research into the dumbing down of the media,\" asks Greg Philo, \"and the destruction of current affairs programming, the effects of violence in the media and the effects of huge corporations taking over the media? \"There's a similar silence in other areas of public policy. Take the drugs debate. Academics spend years researching into ecstasy because the government decides it's a popular area, yet virtually ignore the legal drugs, such as alcohol, that kill thousand and thousands of people each year. It's madness. When the Tories reopened the cannabis debate, the academic world was silent because it had nothing to say; it was left to the police to voice the arguments.\" It's not all bad news, though, as Philo admits. \"There are some organisations, such as the Rowntree Foundation, Nuffield and the trade unions sponsoring independent research,\" he says, \"and very good work is coming out of it. For instance the trade union-sponsored research into stress and bullying in the workplace has made an impact. However, such studies are few and far between. I know that many academics are overworked and demoralised but they must be prepared to stand up and be counted in the public forum.\" But Cotgreave is pessimistic in the light of further research cuts at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. \"The ministry has got to stop cutting its research budget,\" he said. \"Ministers have said that they are preserving their BSE budget, but this means they are cutting other areas that might be important next year or the year after.

      "body": "<p>The final straw for Liz Carnell came when her 12-year-old son John was attacked in a corridor at school. He had been called \"swot\" before, his books had been scribbled on, his pencil case and school bag and rugby kit stolen or destroyed. He had been hit on the head a number of times by another pupil, and had even needed hospital treatment for internal bruising after another boy punched him in the kidneys during a chemistry lesson. On that occasion she had called the police, though they took no action. </p> <p>But after more than a year of torment for John, and what felt like complete indifference from the school, Carnell had had enough. She had visited the school, talked to John's teacher and the headteacher, written, phoned, contacted the governors, written to the local education authority. The school told her: \"We don't have this much trouble with other parents,\" and refused to deal with any specific allegations against the bully. So Carnell took John out of school and kept him at home. She didn't know what else she could do to protect her son. </p> <p>\"We complained in a fairly low-key way to begin with,\" says Carnell, a journalist from Harrogate in Yorkshire. \"I didn't want to make a fuss. But as time went on I got very upset. I used to cry because I didn't know what I had to do to protect John. On one occasion he said to me, 'I wish I was dead.' That's a terrible thing for a parent to have to deal with, to go to work every day knowing that your child is feeling that way.\" The reaction of the school, she says, was \"thoroughly unpleasant\". She says the headteacher told her the bullying must be John's fault. In the end they started legal proceedings against North Yorkshire county council. In 1997, five years after the bullying began, the council paid John \u00a36,000 to settle out of court. </p> <p>Parents and teachers may assume that Carnell's experiences in dealing with her son's bullying are rare, but they would be unwise to be complacent. Last week a 17-year-old boy from Greater Manchester won \u00a31,500 from his local authority because his grammar school was found to be in breach of its duty of care in failing to protect him from being bullied: the first successful legal action over bullying in three decades. </p> <p>Another teenager, Leah Bradford-Smart, now 19, is pursuing a case against West Sussex county council alleging that her school also failed to protect her from persistent bullying. </p> <p>Schools are required by law to have anti-bullying policies, but it appears they will increasingly need to consider the risk of litigation if they cannot satisfy parents. Liz Carnell set up a website after John's case was settled. In less than a year Bullying Online has had 42,000 visitors, and Carnell has responded to 3,700 emails since the site launched in April 1999. A lot of her correspondence, she says, is from parents wanting advice on how to sue their local education authority. </p> <p>Mike McKay knows about the urge to \"go in and blow them all up with a cannon\". When his son Martin was 12, he got a phone call from his ex-wife saying that Martin had tried to kill himself. McKay had not been aware that the boy, who lived with his mother, was being physically bullied and on one occasion had been beaten up with an iron bar. The reaction of the school, he says, was that Martin must have brought it on himself. </p> <p>\"There was one occasion when the whole thing welled up and I was crying and angry and kicking things because I was really, really mad, but I managed to get that rage out of my system. Because of the way the LEA had misinterpreted my son's behaviour, I didn't want to demonstrate too much emotion in case they thought, well it's hardly surprising, his father is off his trolley as well. That's the effect it can have on people.\" </p> <p>Mick Brookes, president of the National Association of Head Teachers and head of a school in Nottinghamshire, agrees McKay's reasoned approach is the best way to deal with the problem. He argues that schools are now much better trained in dealing with bullying. \"In the past schools pretended bullying wasn't happening. Now people realise that it tends to happen everywhere, even in the workplace.\" His view is that no situation of bullying is beyond a solution. \"In my 22 years of being a headteacher I have found that where parents can work together with the school this issue can be cracked every time.\" </p> <p>Liz Carnell will hope he is right. She would like to see local authorities holding training sessions on bullying every year, and heads required to provide information to their governors on the number of complaints about bullying. Schemes to encourage children to support their peers by reporting any bullying should also be encouraged, she says. It is also vital for parents and teachers to be looking for telltale signs, such as cuts and bruises, missing books or repeated visits to the school nurse to try to get out of class. </p> <p>\"Sometimes it can be difficult for parents to tell what is bullying,\" she says. \"When very young children start school they can be in the rough and tumble of the playground and parents don't know whether that constitutes bullying. I would say even then to pop into the school to have a word with the class teacher and hopefully nip it in the bud. It might save a lot of problems in the long run.\" </p> <p> \u0095 Some names have been changed. <br></p> <p> <strong>What parents should do</strong><br></p> <p> \u0095 At the first sign of bullying, ask to see the teacher and explain the situation in a non-confrontational way. Ask them to keep an eye on the situation. </p> <p>\u0095 Ask to see a copy of the school's bullying policy. Procedures for staff, parents and pupils to follow if bullying occurs should be clear and well publicised throughout the school. </p> <p>\u0095 Keep a diary of what your child tells you is happening. </p> <p>\u0095 If the bullying continues, write to the teacher or head of year, asking them to note your concerns on your child's file, together with a note of the action they have taken. </p> <p>\u0095 Write to the headteacher if you are still concerned, outlining everything and including information from the diary to back up your complaint. </p> <p>\u0095 Take your child to a doctor if they are particularly distressed, as medication or counselling may be appropriate. A letter from your doctor to the school will reinforce your case. </p> <p>\u0095 Each time you visit the school take notes, and write after your meeting confirming what you agreed should happen next. </p> <p>\u0095 If you are still unhappy, contact the chair of governors. You are entitled to see a copy of your child's school record within 15 school days. </p> <p>\u0095 The last resort is to make a formal complaint to the local authority, the local government ombudsman, your MP and ultimately the secretary of state, David Blunkett. </p> <p> <strong> Web links</strong><br></p> <p> The Department for Education and Employment: <a href=\"http://www.dfee.gov.uk\">www.dfee.gov.uk</a> <br></p> <p> The National Association of Head Teachers: <a href=\"http://www.naht.org.uk\">www.naht.org.uk</a><br></p> <p> Bullying Online: <a href=\"http://www.bullying.co.uk\">www.bullying.co.uk</a> <br></p> <p> Parentline Plus: <a href=\"http://www.parentlineplus.org.uk\">www.parentlineplus.org.uk</a>, helpline 0808 800 2222 <br></p> <p> A site by George Robinson and Barbara Maines, whose materials are well-regarded: <a href=\"http://www.luckyduck.co.uk\">www.luckyduck.co.uk</a><br></p> <p> Kidscape, a child safety charity: <a href=\"http://www.educate.co.uk/bull2.htm#top\">www.educate.co.uk/bull2.htm#top</a> <br></p> <p> Childline's advice for parents of bullies as well as of bullied children: <a href=\"http://www.childline.org.uk/\"> www.childline.org.ukl</a> <br></p> <p> The BBC's anti-bullying site: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/bully/\">www.bbc.co.uk/education/bully/</a></p>",

On that occasion she had called the police, though they took no action. But after more than a year of torment for John, and what felt like complete indifference from the school, Carnell had had enough. She had visited the school, talked to John's teacher and the headteacher, written, phoned, contacted the governors, written to the local education authority. The school told her: \"We don't have this much trouble with other parents,\" and refused to deal with any specific allegations against the bully. So Carnell took John out of school and kept him at home. She didn't know what else she could do to protect her son. \"We complained in a fairly low-key way to begin with,\" says Carnell, a journalist from Harrogate in Yorkshire. \"I didn't want to make a fuss. But as time went on I got very upset. I used to cry because I didn't know what I had to do to protect John. On one occasion he said to me, 'I wish I was dead.' That's a terrible thing for a parent to have to deal with, to go to work every day knowing that your child is feeling that way.\" The reaction of the school, she says, was \"thoroughly unpleasant\". She says the headteacher told her the bullying must be John's fault. In the end they started legal proceedings against North Yorkshire county council. In 1997, five years after the bullying began, the council paid John \u00a36,000 to settle out of court. Parents and teachers may assume that Carnell's experiences in dealing with her son's bullying are rare, but they would be unwise to be complacent. Last week a 17-year-old boy from Greater Manchester won \u00a31,500 from his local authority because his grammar school was found to be in breach of its duty of care in failing to protect him from being bullied: the first successful legal action over bullying in three decades. Another teenager, Leah Bradford-Smart, now 19, is pursuing a case against West Sussex county council alleging that her school also failed to protect her from persistent bullying. Schools are required by law to have anti-bullying policies, but it appears they will increasingly need to consider the risk of litigation if they cannot satisfy parents. Liz Carnell set up a website after John's case was settled. In less than a year Bullying Online has had 42,000 visitors, and Carnell has responded to 3,700 emails since the site launched in April 1999. A lot of her correspondence, she says, is from parents wanting advice on how to sue their local education authority. Mike McKay knows about the urge to \"go in and blow them all up with a cannon\". When his son Martin was 12, he got a phone call from his ex-wife saying that Martin had tried to kill himself. McKay had not been aware that the boy, who lived with his mother, was being physically bullied and on one occasion had been beaten up with an iron bar. The reaction of the school, he says, was that Martin must have brought it on himself. \"There was one occasion when the whole thing welled up and I was crying and angry and kicking things because I was really, really mad, but I managed to get that rage out of my system. Because of the way the LEA had misinterpreted my son's behaviour, I didn't want to demonstrate too much emotion in case they thought, well it's hardly surprising, his father is off his trolley as well. That's the effect it can have on people.\" Mick Brookes, president of the National Association of Head Teachers and head of a school in Nottinghamshire, agrees McKay's reasoned approach is the best way to deal with the problem. He argues that schools are now much better trained in dealing with bullying. \"In the past schools pretended bullying wasn't happening. Now people realise that it tends to happen everywhere, even in the workplace.\" His view is that no situation of bullying is beyond a solution. \"In my 22 years of being a headteacher I have found that where parents can work together with the school this issue can be cracked every time.\" Liz Carnell will hope he is right. She would like to see local authorities holding training sessions on bullying every year, and heads required to provide information to their governors on the number of complaints about bullying. Schemes to encourage children to support their peers by reporting any bullying should also be encouraged, she says. It is also vital for parents and teachers to be looking for telltale signs, such as cuts and bruises, missing books or repeated visits to the school nurse to try to get out of class. \"Sometimes it can be difficult for parents to tell what is bullying,\" she says. \"When very young children start school they can be in the rough and tumble of the playground and parents don't know whether that constitutes bullying. I would say even then to pop into the school to have a word with the class teacher and hopefully nip it in the bud. It might save a lot of problems in the long run.\" \u0095 Some names have been changed. What parents should do \u0095 At the first sign of bullying, ask to see the teacher and explain the situation in a non-confrontational way. Ask them to keep an eye on the situation. \u0095 Ask to see a copy of the school's bullying policy. Procedures for staff, parents and pupils to follow if bullying occurs should be clear and well publicised throughout the school. \u0095 Keep a diary of what your child tells you is happening. \u0095 If the bullying continues, write to the teacher or head of year, asking them to note your concerns on your child's file, together with a note of the action they have taken. \u0095 Write to the headteacher if you are still concerned, outlining everything and including information from the diary to back up your complaint. \u0095 Take your child to a doctor if they are particularly distressed, as medication or counselling may be appropriate. A letter from your doctor to the school will reinforce your case. \u0095 Each time you visit the school take notes, and write after your meeting confirming what you agreed should happen next. \u0095 If you are still unhappy, contact the chair of governors. You are entitled to see a copy of your child's school record within 15 school days. \u0095 The last resort is to make a formal complaint to the local authority, the local government ombudsman, your MP and ultimately the secretary of state, David Blunkett.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When is a slap not a slap? When it's administered by a teacher in \"exceptional circumstances, where there is an immediate risk of injury\", according to Section 550a of the Education Act 1996: then, it becomes \"reasonable force\". To prevent a pupil from committing an offence, injuring him/herself or others, damaging property or behaving in a manner likely to disrupt good order, \"a member of the staff of a school may use ... such force as is reasonable.\" </p> <p>The problem - one of many to emerge from the law governing teachers' rights to restrain pupils - comes with that word \"reasonable\". Is it reasonable to hit a child who is scribbling on a desk? What if the child tips that desk over, or throws a chair? What if that child then throws a chair at a teacher, or another pupil? Most parents, and teachers themselves, would say no, that to react to any of these situations with a slap is unacceptable since the abolition of corporal punishment. </p> <p>So, slapping is out. But detentions and threats of treats withdrawn often - as any teacher or, indeed, child will admit - fail to control a pupil intent on causing havoc. Is it then reasonable to lock that pupil in a cupboard, throw water in his or her face, tie two young siblings together with a skipping rope? The regulations here are not so much a grey area as a black hole. </p> <p>The above incidents were all alleged to have taken place at St Mary's primary school in Caldicot, Wales, where headteacher Marjorie Evans is soon to restart her career after 13 months of suspension. Accusations that she had slapped an unruly pupil were cast out at the Court of Appeal last month; no charges will be brought in relation to the other claims. </p> <p>Evans robustly denies accusations that she has mistreated pupils, but happily concedes that the \"skipping rope\" incident did happen. The loose tying together of wrists while the two, a brother and sister, were in a group taking part in a sponsored walk was, she insists, done for the protection of both of them - staff were worried that the boy could have run into the road and been hit by a car. It was carried out, says Evans, in a jovial manner: the children themselves were amused, and their mother has expressed her support for the school. </p> <p>Others involved in the care of children aren't so sure that such measures are as harmless as they might first appear. \"It's outrageous,\" says Carolyn Hamilton of the Children's Legal Centre. \"Tying children together definitely crosses the line. Force can only be used in very specific circumstances, ones in which children will pose a danger. Restraint is not appropriate for small children being naughty.\" </p> <p>Many teachers are not so certain. When faced with very difficult behaviour, many are unsure about the severity of any sanctions, and are afraid that if they inadvertently overstep the line they could face charges of abuse. And, reading the guidelines issued by the Department for Education and Employment in September 1998 in an attempt to clarify the 1996 Act, is it any wonder? </p> <p>\"There is no legal definition of 'reasonable force'\", the guidelines state, \"so it is not possible to set out comprehensively when it is reasonable to use force, or the degree of force that may reasonably be used. It will always depend on the circumstances.\" </p> <p>So it remains a matter of interpretation. \"Three years ago you couldn't do anything at all - it had almost got to the point where you had to stand back if a child was violent,\" says Roger Alexander, who was headteacher at a \"fairly tough\" primary school for 13 years. \"After various attacks on teachers, it's now agreed that you can use reasonable force to protect yourself, the child, or another child,\" he explains. </p> <p>So, was it acceptable to tether two children to each other with a rope? Definitely not, in his opinion. \"It just wouldn't work. It's like putting two fireworks side by side. What you need to do is attach - not literally - one child to one teacher and the other to another teacher. It sends a message to the other kids and isolates the ones causing the problems.\" </p> <p>Fiona Campbell, a primary school teacher from Sheffield, agrees. \"There is no place in education for such a humiliating thing,\" she insists. \"What worries me is that people will think this sort of thing regularly goes on in schools, but it doesn't and shouldn't.\" She admits that teachers can be pushed to the limits by the more challenging children, but argues that there are other ways to deal with such a situation. \"The key thing is safety. If you think that children will be unsafe on a sponsored walk, then you don't take them, even if it means that the whole class doesn't go.\" </p> <p>One problem for primary teachers in particular is that there are very few sanctions available to them. Young children cannot be detained after school. Removing the child from a classroom is only a short-term solution. Very quickly, the teacher can find that he or she has run out of disciplinary measures to control a child who simply will not stop misbehaving. </p> <p>Often, says Alexander, the teacher's situation is complicated by the fact that parents can be blind to their child's faults. Conversely, there are parents who are all too keen for teachers to take a firm hand with their offspring. Parents like Robert Whelan, director of Family and Youth Concern (FYC). \"A smack brings a problem to a conclusion,\" he says. So what do parents like this think of more moderate sanctions, such as the use of a skipping rope as a restraint? \"The law should not be brought to bear on a teacher who is doing her job,\" Whelan says without hesitation. \"It is up to parents to decide whether methods of discipline are acceptable. The parents in the skipping rope case supported Marjorie Evans, but she has not been supported by the system. If the parents agree, let that be an end to it. Those who don't can find another school to send their children to.\" </p> <p>But shouldn't parents be able to send their children to school in the knowledge that physical force will not be used against them? \"I'd go mad if a teacher did that to my daughter,\" says Tom Carney, who has three children aged between 10 and 21. \"There should still be punishment in schools - and I think there's still room for the cane if a kid is really naughty - but there's got to be a line you don't cross.\" </p> <p>If a child is not physically harmed, it can be easy to overlook the fact that force has been used. Paula Woodhurst recalls an incident when her son, now 21, told her that his teacher had grabbed his tie and pushed him against a wall. \"I told him he probably deserved it, because I knew what a horror he could be,\" she says. \"I should have gone up to the school, but I had sympathy for the teacher.\" </p> <p>DfEE guidelines dictate that detailed records should be kept of all incidents where force is used, and that parents should be invited to discuss it. This does not, however, allow the child the same opportunity. Children often have different ideas from adults about what can \"reasonably\" be done to them. Humiliation, after all, can be as distressing as pain. </p> <p>\"I would have felt worried, and afraid of what she was going to do next,\" says Jasmine, eight, of the skipping rope solution. \"I've never seen it done, and it shouldn't be allowed. It's not funny.\" Matthew, 12, agrees that \"it wouldn't be right,\" but concedes that \"it's a bit funny, but then it isn't really. It probably causes pain. It's probably embarrassing. And it's illegal, isn't it?\" </p> <p>Both children appreciate that pupils can wind their teachers up to the point where tempers are lost and lessons are wasted. \"There is a boy in my class who annoys the teacher, and it affects the whole class, stops us from learning,\" explains Matthew. </p> <p>The recognition that children be protected from violence has meant there is no longer any place in the classroom for the cane. It has also meant that there is little room for error on the part of teachers. At a briefing for heads, Alexander recalls being warned that few teachers could expect to retire without having been suspended at least once. Official figures indicate that such measures are still rare - the National Union of Teachers registered 120 allegations against teachers last year, of which 60% were proved false. But teachers can feel as if they are under siege: \"If a child makes a claim, then you're guilty until proven innocent. The automatic procedures just kick in.\" </p> <p>They certainly did for Sarah Foster. She too was falsely accused of assaulting a pupil, at the infant school at which she is head. She was interviewed (and photographed, and finger-printed) by police. Within 24 hours, the Crown Prosecution Service decided there was no case to answer. Nevertheless, she was suspended by the local authority while it carried out its own investigation; she was reinstated two weeks later. The child remains on the site. </p> <p>\"I still feel devastated. There is very little support for teachers. You get complaints from parents whose children have been kicked and thumped by difficult pupils, and you realise that those complaints are justified. You need to remove a child from a situation when he is disruptive, but teachers are wary about stepping in.\" </p> <p>On Thursday, the NUT will unveil its new guidelines to teachers. They promise to go beyond the advice offered by the DfEE, which many teachers find impractical. \"Teachers need more protection and more clarity,\" agrees Foster. \"At the moment, the code of conduct is just not detailed enough. Everything seems to be working against the teacher.\" </p> <p> \u0095 Some names have been changed.</p>",

The former shop steward, whom critics had feared would prove ineffectual, seized the opportunity to reveal an uncompromising side a week after being elected to replace Betty Boothroyd. Responding to allegations that the Ministry of Defence had leaked a story about shipbuilding contracts the day before making an announcement in the Commons, he said: \"If ministers were to release information to the press before the house is informed of major policy developments I would regard that as an unacceptable discourtesy. I would expect the minister concerned to apologise to the house.\" Ms Boothroyd had made similar pleas about the need for ministers to announce policy first and foremost to MPs, but last week's bitterly fought election left Mr Martin in little doubt that backbenchers were desperate to reassert their collective rights. In his first press conference, he said it was up to backbenchers, not him, to bring ministers to heel. His tough stance yesterday followed a complaint by the Tory MP for Buckingham, John Bercow, that a statement about shipbuilding contracts was placed on the BBC website last Thursday \"precisely one hour and 59 minutes\" before it was made to MPs. Versions of the story, revealing that four roll-on/roll-off ferries would be built on Merseyside, had also appeared in various papers that morning, including the Guardian. The Speaker conceded that \"broadly accurate advance information\" had reached the media but said he accepted the assurance of the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, that he was \"confident\" it had not come from his department. Nevertheless, he expected ministers to take steps to ensure that any organisations privy to such confidential information should not leak it, and called on Mr Hoon to investigate last week's leak. Mr Martin also told ministers they should think carefully about announcing policy initiatives as part of debates, instead of making an official announcement to the house. Backbenchers needed time to prepare to question government policies.

The latest epidemic of HE can be detected in the astonishing case of R v Botmeh and Alami, which is currently before the court of appeal. Jawad Botmeh and Samar Alami, two young Palestinian activists, were convicted in 1996 of conspiracy \"with persons unknown\" to bomb the Israeli embassy in 1994 and sent to prison for 20 years.</p> <p>Three years ago, the MI5 agent David Shayler revealed that shortly after the bombing he became aware that there had been a warning of a terrorist attack on the Israeli embassy. Ministers, led by Home Secretary Jack Straw, abused Shayler as a traitor and a fantasist, and ridiculed his assertion that any such warning had been received by the security services. Last week it emerged in court that Shayler was telling the truth. After months of prevarication, the security services finally admitted that there was such a warning and that it had nothing to do with Samar Alami or Jawad Botmeh.</p> <p>Why hasn't anyone heard about this before? The answer is simple. The security services and the Metropolitan police special branch were struck down with a terrible attack of HE - an attack that rendered them quite incapable of carrying out their most elementary duties in the course of criminal justice.</p> <p>From what emerged in court last Thursday, I counted six separate cases of HE.</p> <p>The terrorist organisation warning was \"disseminated\" by a document within the security service, but \"for reasons of human error\" it was not placed on the files shown to prosecution counsel in the Jawad/Alami case.</p> <p>Other documents from the same source were placed before counsel. One of these documents referred to the Israeli embassy, but this was not shown to Mr Justice Garland, the judge in the case, during the disclosure hearing. The reason was oversight, a nasty variant of HE.</p> <p>A copy of the document about the warning was passed by MI5 to MI6. This was handled by the MI6 desk officer dealing with the terrorist group named in the document. For reasons almost certainly connected with HE, this was not the officer responsible for disclosure of information in the Botmeh/Alami case.</p> <p>The information was filed by the desk officer but somehow did not emerge in the disclosure hearings in the Botmeh/ Alami case. The reason was obvious: human error.</p> <p>The document was also passed to the Metropolitan police special branch whose officers were hunting the bombers. It was \"placed in a file germane to the main thread of the information received but was not placed on the file connected to the Israeli embassy or one which would have fallen within the crown disclosure.\" Another bad case of HE, this time in special branch.</p> <p>There was a cross-reference to the document in a file review for disclosure which would have led to the document if noted, but the unusual physical position of the cross-reference on the file was such that it was overlooked during the disclosure exercise. Another awful case of HE.</p> <p>From this grim catalogue, there are only two possible conclusions. The first is that both sections of the security services are so hopelessly disorganised that they cannot follow elementary rules of disclosure, and that even in cases involving terrorism and bombing there is not the slightest chance that they will make good use of any information they receive. The second is that in this case MI5, MI6 and special branch conspired not to disclose information which might damage the prosecution of Samar and Jawad.</p> <p>Either alternative is, to put it mildly, disturbing. What cannot be contemplated is that after such monumental and shocking failure to disclose obviously crucial information, the flawed case against Samar and Jawad should be allowed to continue. They are back in prison. Their appeal is adjourned while their lawyers investigate yet more evidence, revealed in court last Friday and outlined in detail in last Sunday's Observer, that the police knew of another suspect but kept quiet about him.</p> <p>Surely these two young people should not have to rot any longer in jail. The plain fact is that someone else, with no connection to either prisoner, bombed the Israeli embassy. No European court or hearing under the Human Rights Act could possibly conclude that the trial of Samar and Jawad was fair. Both should be released at once on bail while their innocence is established.</p> <p>If the director of public prosecutions (David Calvert-Smith QC), who declared that he will not have any role in the current appeal, concludes that the failure of the original prosecution (masterminded by leading prosecution counsel David Calvert-Smith QC) was bungled because of human error, that is entirely a matter for him.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Almost as dangerous as BSE is HE, or human error, the disease which constantly comes to the assistance of the police and security services in their hour of need. The latest epidemic of HE can be detected in the astonishing case of R v Botmeh and Alami, which is currently before the court of appeal. Jawad Botmeh and Samar Alami, two young Palestinian activists, were convicted in 1996 of conspiracy \"with persons unknown\" to bomb the Israeli embassy in 1994 and sent to prison for 20 years. Three years ago, the MI5 agent David Shayler revealed that shortly after the bombing he became aware that there had been a warning of a terrorist attack on the Israeli embassy. Ministers, led by Home Secretary Jack Straw, abused Shayler as a traitor and a fantasist, and ridiculed his assertion that any such warning had been received by the security services. Last week it emerged in court that Shayler was telling the truth. After months of prevarication, the security services finally admitted that there was such a warning and that it had nothing to do with Samar Alami or Jawad Botmeh. Why hasn't anyone heard about this before? The answer is simple. The security services and the Metropolitan police special branch were struck down with a terrible attack of HE - an attack that rendered them quite incapable of carrying out their most elementary duties in the course of criminal justice. From what emerged in court last Thursday, I counted six separate cases of HE. The terrorist organisation warning was \"disseminated\" by a document within the security service, but \"for reasons of human error\" it was not placed on the files shown to prosecution counsel in the Jawad/Alami case. Other documents from the same source were placed before counsel. One of these documents referred to the Israeli embassy, but this was not shown to Mr Justice Garland, the judge in the case, during the disclosure hearing. The reason was oversight, a nasty variant of HE. A copy of the document about the warning was passed by MI5 to MI6. This was handled by the MI6 desk officer dealing with the terrorist group named in the document. For reasons almost certainly connected with HE, this was not the officer responsible for disclosure of information in the Botmeh/Alami case. The information was filed by the desk officer but somehow did not emerge in the disclosure hearings in the Botmeh/ Alami case. The reason was obvious: human error. The document was also passed to the Metropolitan police special branch whose officers were hunting the bombers. It was \"placed in a file germane to the main thread of the information received but was not placed on the file connected to the Israeli embassy or one which would have fallen within the crown disclosure.\" Another bad case of HE, this time in special branch. There was a cross-reference to the document in a file review for disclosure which would have led to the document if noted, but the unusual physical position of the cross-reference on the file was such that it was overlooked during the disclosure exercise. Another awful case of HE. From this grim catalogue, there are only two possible conclusions. The first is that both sections of the security services are so hopelessly disorganised that they cannot follow elementary rules of disclosure, and that even in cases involving terrorism and bombing there is not the slightest chance that they will make good use of any information they receive. The second is that in this case MI5, MI6 and special branch conspired not to disclose information which might damage the prosecution of Samar and Jawad. Either alternative is, to put it mildly, disturbing. What cannot be contemplated is that after such monumental and shocking failure to disclose obviously crucial information, the flawed case against Samar and Jawad should be allowed to continue. They are back in prison. Their appeal is adjourned while their lawyers investigate yet more evidence, revealed in court last Friday and outlined in detail in last Sunday's Observer, that the police knew of another suspect but kept quiet about him. Surely these two young people should not have to rot any longer in jail. The plain fact is that someone else, with no connection to either prisoner, bombed the Israeli embassy. No European court or hearing under the Human Rights Act could possibly conclude that the trial of Samar and Jawad was fair. Both should be released at once on bail while their innocence is established. If the director of public prosecutions (David Calvert-Smith QC), who declared that he will not have any role in the current appeal, concludes that the failure of the original prosecution (masterminded by leading prosecution counsel David Calvert-Smith QC) was bungled because of human error, that is entirely a matter for him. comment@theguardian.com",

The bomb, detonated by remote control, exploded when General Jose Francisco Querol, a 69-year-old high court judge, assigned to the military tribunal, was driving past on his way to work. The general, his chauffeur and police bodyguard were killed as his car catapulted into the air and flew over a bus. The driver of the bus, two passengers and two passers-by, including an 11-year-old girl, were badly injured. Emergency workers treated a further 60 people in a field hospital set up nearby. The explosion, just after 9am, turned a residential street in the north of the city into a scene of carnage as victims cried for help and ambulances struggled to reach them through dense smoke, burning cars and debris from shattered buildings. The bombing, which bore all the hallmarks of Eta, brought the number of people killed by the group so far this year to 19. Querol, a soldier and a judge, belonged to two of the professions most often attacked by the organisation, which has also killed several politicians and journalists. \"Eta chooses its victims among the defenders of the rule of law because it wants to subvert it.

The attack marks an escalation in Eta violence. In its current campaign it had singled out specific targets but avoided injury to passers-by. Most of its victims have been shot at close range. This time the bomb, thought by police to contain up to 30kg of dynamite, went off 25 metres from Querol's home when his car had stopped at traffic lights and was bound to be surrounded by people. It recalled the worst days of Eta's random bombing in the early 1980s and took place near the spot where the group tried to kill the prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, with a similar car bomb in 1995. The Basque regional government, led by the mainstream Basque Nationalist Party (PNV), was quick to condemn the attack. \"Eta's talk of democracy is a travesty,\" its chief spokesman said. \"It has no idea of what democracy is and seeks only to blackmail and destroy.\" Mr Aznar has accused the PNV of being soft on terrorism after it signed an agreement with Eta in 1998 to work together for an independent state in return for an end to violence.

New Zealander Mike Coburn, 36, is fighting attempts by the Ministry of Defence to block publication of his account of the 1991 Gulf war venture in the book Soldier 5. The New Zealand high court was told that the MoD considered the team expendable. Coburn, the pen name used by the former soldier, was with the SAS between 1990 and 1997 and was part of the eight man Bravo Two Zero team. Three were killed and four, including Coburn, were captured. He told Justice Peter Salmon that he blamed the regimental hierarchy for the deaths. \"We had been compromised primarily due to the fact that we had been placed in an area right next to a significant number of enemy forces, when there should not have been any,\" Coburn said. \"Being told we were expendable after the fact only served to compound the betrayal of trust.\" Last week MoD lawyers said publication of the book should be blocked because military teams could be undermined if details of their operations were made public. Coburn's lawyers said he signed a confidentiality agreement under duress and that it contravened the Human Rights Act which Britain was obliged to recognise under the European convention on human rights.

She tells this morning's Le Monde that she has received several film offers as a result of its publication earlier this month. What is more, next month she will release a new album of French and German songs, and, as if to further capitalise on the novel's triumph in Paris, she has a week of concerts at the Folies Berg\u00e8res starting on November 27. Schuhl's novel won the prize by only four votes to three, just beating Allah n'est pas Oblige (Allah Doesn't Have To) by Ahmadou Kourama, which was given the consolation prize, the Prix Renaudot. Schuhl, 59, is hardly a well-known writer in France, not least because Ingrid Caven is his first novel for nearly 25 years. \"It's been a long time since I've written, and it's a dramatic turn of events,\" he told France-2 television after winning the award. \"I didn't expect it.\" Caven was married to the film director Rainer Werner Fassbinder, and starred in many of his pictures.

To Lib\u00e9ration's critic, the novel resembled a film seen from the perspective of the \"eternal spectator\" called Charles (who bears some resemblance to Schuhl) with scenes embroiling the likes of Laurent and Bette Davis as well as fictional characters unfolding before him and before the reader. The novel none the less evokes Caven's life during the 1970s and her cocaine-fuelled excesses with Fassbinder. The choice of Schuhl's novel is certainly a vote for French literary iconoclasm at a time when the country's literary prizes in general, and the Goncourt in particular, have been widely criticised for not rewarding literary merit but bowing to the pressures of leading publishers. The Goncourt has also been attacked for not changing its judges regularly and thus becoming complacent and insular.

      "body": "<p>One of Boston's top lawyers is sitting on the edge of his seat in his spacious waterfront offices, talking animatedly about one of his clients. Ken Parsigian specialises in difficult cases and is part of a growing band of Americans concerned about the death-penalty verdict given to Kenny Richey 14 years ago in Ohio. Richey, now 36, was convicted of murdering a two-year-old girl in an arson attack in the small town of Columbus Grove. He is still waiting to be executed.</p> <p>Appealing against the death penalty is never easy. But Parsigian says: \"If I could hit the reset button and do Kenny's trial today, I'd bet my house that he would go free.\"</p> <p>Richey, born to a Scottish mother and an American father, grew up in Edinburgh. When his parents divorced in 1982 Richey decided to follow his father back to the US to start a new life. He had been a troubled, angry young man and although things started well - he married and joined the Marines - it was not to last. He left the army and divorce followed.</p> <p>Richey decided to join his father, then living in a low-rent apartment block on the edge of Columbus Grove. It is classic midwest America, where many of the hardworking citizens fly the stars and stripes outside their houses. They didn't much like the largely welfare-assisted, single-parent and jobless residents of the Old Village Apartments.</p> <p>To the young women who lived in or hung around the apartments, Richey, the outsider with the Scottish accent, was the nearest thing to exotic in their world. Candy Barchett, then 19, was smitten. For a few weeks in June 1986 she and Richey would meet regularly to gossip and party on the wooden landing between the apartments with their neighbours, Hope Collins, a single mother of a two-year-old girl, Cynthia, and Peggy Villereal.</p> <p>The afternoon of June 30 started like any other but by two o'clock next morning, Collins's daughter would be dead, killed by a fire at her home. Richey was arrested next day and charged with arson and murder.</p> <p>The prosecution argued that Richey was in a drunken jealous rage after his girlfriend left to spend the night with Mike Nichols who lived in the apartment below Collins. The fire investigators sifting through the burned-out flat the following day discovered that the smoke detector had been disconnected from its mounting. It was this crucial piece of evidence that was to earn Richey the death penalty. The Scot was said to have had motive and opportunity. He had poured petrol in the flat above and set it alight to kill Barchett and her lover, asleep in the flat below. Most damningly, witnesses said they had heard Richey say he was going to burn the building that night.</p> <p>Richey has stated that he was never jealous of Barchett and Nichols. Casual sexual encounters were part and parcel of daily life at the apartments. He claims he was planning to return to Scotland for good the following week and had already booked his ticket.</p> <p>Several witnesses who saw him that night say he watched as Nichols and Barchett kissed in front of him and that he did not seem to mind.</p> <p>But it is the following sequence of events that Richey's supporters say makes little sense. Prosecutors argue that Richey, heavily intoxicated, laden with two heavy cans of petrol, climbed on to a 5ft-high wall, then jumped on to Collins's balcony and poured the petrol on to her living-room floor to kill his intended victims below. The fact that it was a hot evening and Barchett had left her window open, that the door to the Collins apartment was unlocked, as everyone knew, and that forensic tests could find no trace of petrol on Richey's clothing seems to have mattered little to his case.</p> <p>But the last straw for his supporters was that a plausible explanation for the disabled smoke detector was provided to Richey's lawyer, William Kluge. Villereal had told him that she had seen Collins take it down that day: \"Hope was cooking some pork chops on a pan and the detector went off. She dragged over a chair and pulled it down.\" But Kluge did not present that evidence.</p> <p>He was a young, inexperienced attorney appointed by the state to represent Richey.

      "bodyText": "One of Boston's top lawyers is sitting on the edge of his seat in his spacious waterfront offices, talking animatedly about one of his clients. Ken Parsigian specialises in difficult cases and is part of a growing band of Americans concerned about the death-penalty verdict given to Kenny Richey 14 years ago in Ohio. Richey, now 36, was convicted of murdering a two-year-old girl in an arson attack in the small town of Columbus Grove. He is still waiting to be executed. Appealing against the death penalty is never easy. But Parsigian says: \"If I could hit the reset button and do Kenny's trial today, I'd bet my house that he would go free.\" Richey, born to a Scottish mother and an American father, grew up in Edinburgh. When his parents divorced in 1982 Richey decided to follow his father back to the US to start a new life. He had been a troubled, angry young man and although things started well - he married and joined the Marines - it was not to last. He left the army and divorce followed. Richey decided to join his father, then living in a low-rent apartment block on the edge of Columbus Grove. It is classic midwest America, where many of the hardworking citizens fly the stars and stripes outside their houses. They didn't much like the largely welfare-assisted, single-parent and jobless residents of the Old Village Apartments. To the young women who lived in or hung around the apartments, Richey, the outsider with the Scottish accent, was the nearest thing to exotic in their world. Candy Barchett, then 19, was smitten. For a few weeks in June 1986 she and Richey would meet regularly to gossip and party on the wooden landing between the apartments with their neighbours, Hope Collins, a single mother of a two-year-old girl, Cynthia, and Peggy Villereal. The afternoon of June 30 started like any other but by two o'clock next morning, Collins's daughter would be dead, killed by a fire at her home. Richey was arrested next day and charged with arson and murder. The prosecution argued that Richey was in a drunken jealous rage after his girlfriend left to spend the night with Mike Nichols who lived in the apartment below Collins. The fire investigators sifting through the burned-out flat the following day discovered that the smoke detector had been disconnected from its mounting. It was this crucial piece of evidence that was to earn Richey the death penalty. The Scot was said to have had motive and opportunity. He had poured petrol in the flat above and set it alight to kill Barchett and her lover, asleep in the flat below. Most damningly, witnesses said they had heard Richey say he was going to burn the building that night. Richey has stated that he was never jealous of Barchett and Nichols. Casual sexual encounters were part and parcel of daily life at the apartments. He claims he was planning to return to Scotland for good the following week and had already booked his ticket. Several witnesses who saw him that night say he watched as Nichols and Barchett kissed in front of him and that he did not seem to mind. But it is the following sequence of events that Richey's supporters say makes little sense. Prosecutors argue that Richey, heavily intoxicated, laden with two heavy cans of petrol, climbed on to a 5ft-high wall, then jumped on to Collins's balcony and poured the petrol on to her living-room floor to kill his intended victims below. The fact that it was a hot evening and Barchett had left her window open, that the door to the Collins apartment was unlocked, as everyone knew, and that forensic tests could find no trace of petrol on Richey's clothing seems to have mattered little to his case. But the last straw for his supporters was that a plausible explanation for the disabled smoke detector was provided to Richey's lawyer, William Kluge. Villereal had told him that she had seen Collins take it down that day: \"Hope was cooking some pork chops on a pan and the detector went off. She dragged over a chair and pulled it down.\" But Kluge did not present that evidence. He was a young, inexperienced attorney appointed by the state to represent Richey. There was a catalogue of disasters. He appointed Gregory Du Bois, a defence expert, to challenge the prosecution's charge of arson. Except that Du Bois was no expert. He was a metallurgist whose only experience of fire forensics was a four-day course from the Ohio State Arson Bureau - the very people claiming the fire had been arson, and whom Du Bois was to investigate independently. Not surprisingly, he agreed with the bureau. The assistant prosecutor in the case was Randolph Bassinger, a young, ambitious lawyer who at the time of the trial was running a high- profile campaign for election as a county judge. In the days after the fire, feelings were running high in Columbus Grove. Richey, the outsider, was the wrong face in the wrong place. It was Bassinger who called for the death penalty - the first in the county for more than a century. There is a final, cruel twist in Richey's story.

Collins had a history of playing with matches. The fire brigade had been called out on three occasions to fires started by her. Again, this evidence was not heard at the trial. However, in US jurisprudence it is almost impossible to introduce new evidence challenging original trial findings. Parsigian is not hopeful in this case. He has one appeal left in the state federal court but the standard of proof is extremely tough. Richey's only chance may be clemency from the state governor - who is not known as a liberal in such cases. Richey himself is philosophical. \"There is nothing to do on death row but wait and wait and wait, and hope that the waiting comes to an end sooner or later.\" He points through his cell window to an imposing building that was the original Mansfield Prison. \"It's the place where they filmed The Shawshank Redemption.

Usually liberal in their outlook, some phrases are harsh, while others have dark echoes of Twin Peaks: \"Bodies lie in long grass, some are murdered and some are picnicking.\" Often mistaken for Holzer's own take on life, the Truisms are in fact starting points for debate. \"Illness is a state of mind\", \"Being happy is more important than anything else\", \"A lot of professionals are crackpots\" - they said to the whole of Newcastle: discuss. </p> <p>On the night a good-sized crowd gathered, some with cameras trying to chase the words up the facade, others clutching the limited-edition souvenir beer mats bearing Holzer's words.

The Brooks/Gene Wilder script runs the gamut of screen humour from witty-to-slapstick (\"A riot is an ugly thing - and it's time we had one!\"), and there's a top-flight, fall-about cast: Wilder as the grandson of the Baron; Madeline Kahn his fiancee; Marty Feldman as Igor and Gene Hackman hilariously dangerous as the hermit. But none is better than Peter Boyle's bewildered creature. The Beast With Five Fingers (Robert Florey, 1947) 1am, TCM Rounding off the Halloween horrors is this incredibly gruesome tale about a bunch of no-good money grabbers getting their pay-off from beyond the grave of deceased concert pianist Ingram (Victor Francen). Gathered in a spooky Italian mansion they hear the ghostly tinkling of the ivories as the musician's severed hand takes on a deadly life of its own: as do the bulging eyes of terrified Peter Lorre. Play it again, Ingram.",

And let's not forget veteran naif rocker Jonathan Richman, who'll be popping over to play a one-off show at London's Forum this Saturday, which will almost certainly not be our last chance to hear such timeless classics as Pablo Picasso, and um... ah... oh, never mind.",

      "body": "<p>Painting the Century ambles through the ground floor galleries and corridors of the National Portrait Gallery. A picture a year for the century: 101 works, from 1900 to the millennium. It is a journey through styles and movements, an incomplete and inconclusive story. The exhibition can't quite make up its mind whether it is a show of the century's portraits, or of portraits of the century. </p> <p>As the exhibition's curator, Robin Gibson, says, this is not an anthology of the century's greatest portraits. Hence, I suppose, no Antonin Artaud, for example, and no Pierre Bonnard; instead, Hans Haake's Maggie Thatcher is here, as well as Michael J Browne's Eric Cantona, for what he's worth. Exhibitions are almost invariably constrained by what is available. There are a few great paintings - Picasso's 1905 Woman in a Chemise, Warhol's Double Elvis, a great lumpen, cyclops-eyed Philip Guston of a man smoking (the 20th century was the century of smoking) - but perhaps it doesn't always take great artists and great subjects to reveal a moment, the spirit of an age, its texture and tone. In fact, mediocrity, or at least minor art, often does just as well - at telling a story, recalling the atmosphere of an epoch. </p> <p>There are interesting oddball things. George Gershwin's 1934 self-portrait, his hand like a paw, his face self-caricatured against musical staves; Isaac Brodsky's lonely Lenin in Red Square, in working-man's clothes, the crowds milling miles away across the stones; and some works which really have no place in any exhibition at all. Stephen Finer's wretched David Bowie and Iman is one, Charles Wellington Furse's 1903 Gainsborough-esque portrait of his wife Diana, out with the greyhounds on a windy day, another. The only notable thing about this piece of Edwardian dung is that Furse's mum crouched behind her daughter-in-law as the artist painted her, blowing air up Diana's skirts with a bellows to achieve the required windy day effect. </p> <p>I find I have written \"AAARGH\" all over the catalogue page featuring Lovis Corinth's 1911 portrait of zoo owner Carl Hagenbeck. The zoo-owner rests a proprietorial hand on a great mustachioed walrus, who, with beady eye and hairy maw, seems intent on Hagenbeck's crotch. What perversity led the curator to ship this picture all the way from Hamburg? Maybe he simply wanted us to be astounded. </p> <p>The ludicrous aside, there are certain paintings here whose dramatised truths seem to provide the exact feel of their time. German painter George Scholz's self-portrait, standing in front of an advertising column, is the quintessential man in the street, a petit bourgouis in the gloom. I love this painting's quiet, the way Scholz meets us with a quizzical eye on the corner as we pass. Later, in 1940, when Scholz has retreated from public life to a small provincial German town, we meet Felix Nussbaum, who was interned in France in 1940, and later deported and killed at Auschwitz. Nussbaum portrays himself in rags in a camp, on a wretchedly bleak and bone-strewn patch of ground between the huts. I flashback to Scholz, buttoned-up warm against the cold, his collar clean, his tie neat. Perhaps one of the problems of this show is that there are too many possible stories, too many conections to be made. </p> <p>I also think of works which are not here, but ought to be: Hitler in armour, carrying a banner, by Lanzinger; Adolf Wissel's creepy National Socialist happy family group portrait, and Felix Nussbaum's 1943 self-portrait, holding up his Judenpass. Instead, for 1943, we have Meredith Frampton's remarkable painting of the London Civil Defence Control Room in South Kensington. This is no Dad's Army gag. Three senior civil defence officers are painted in their underground centre of operations: maps on the wall, memos and notes everywhere, a teacup on the table. It is a painting of details - a pint of milk, the red and cream coloured telephones, the dangling flex and sallow artificial light. Frampton really captures the dim electric light. Everything, including the sitters, seems to be made of Bakelite. It is all rendered with a hypnotic acuity which borders on the surreal. Peculiar and full of atmosphere, this unnaturally impeturbable scene could be viewed as stiff-upper-lip propa ganda, but somehow none of this makes this painting a failure as art. </p> <p>Suddenly, war is over and here's the Belgian poet and mescaline- eating artist Henri Michaux, painted by Dubuffet. We are back in the realms of modern art. But it is a fitful journey, which takes us to Dali-land and back, via New York, where Ben Shahn paints Dag Hammarskjold penning a speech to the UN, and on to the London Soho bohemia of the Colony Room, by Michael Andrews. It is 1962 now, but the Colony hasn't changed a jot. Only the denizens of the club have changed. They're all dead: Jeffrey and Bruce Bernard, Francis Bacon, the awful barman Ian Board. The Colony Room is set not so much in aspic as in fag ash and whisky. </p> <p>One of the last things Bruce Bernard produced, before he died this year, was the monumental book Century, Bernard's own month-by-month anthology of 20th century photography. Photography and film were the media of the past 100 years, and the National Portrait Gallery barely touches the subject. Let photography in, the show seems to concede, and all this painting will have to go. The proliferation of photographic images over the past century - many of which have achieved a more common iconic status than any painting (which is more telling: a movie still of a napalmed girl in Vietnam or Picasso's Guernica?) - has not meant that painting has been downgraded, but that it has become freer to do precisely those things that photography cannot, or could not do, until the advent of the digitalised, infinitely manipulable image. </p> <p>Robert Silvers' 1996 portrait of Bill Gates, composed of a digital mosaic of thousands of banknotes, owes a great deal to the paintings of Chuck Close, but Silvers' portrait isn't a painting. (And what is Cindy Sherman's self-portrait photograph doing here?) Close's own painting here, a black and white, enlarged photorealist portrait of stage designer Robert Israel, is described in the catalogue as \"nice, good-looking and 'preppy'\". His staring eyes and slack mouth make me think he looks mad. But it is as much the distortions of the close-up, the shallow depth of field accentuated by Close's painting of it, that distorts him. </p> <p>Going back to Walter Sickert's 1936 picture Jack and Jill, based on a film still of Edward G Robinson and Joan Blondell in the noir movie Bullets or Ballots, one realises how much photography and the movies have infiltrated and changed painting. Sickert can in some ways be seen as an unacknowledged precursor to many more recent painters who have worked from the photograph. Gerhard Richter's paintings, and especially those dealing with the Baader-Meinhof gang, deserve to be acknowleged here. They are portraits of German society, portraits of guilt, and portraits of our own voyeurism. If not \"portraits of the century\", they remain the most important suite of paintings to have been made in post-war Europe (post-war Germany being, precisely, Richter's subject). </p> <p>A summary of the political and cultural events of the century puts the portraits in context, but further individual descriptions on the walls are frequently more irritating than helpful. Franz Gertsch's painting of the transvestite artist Luciano Castelli being made-up by his girlfriend Marina is annotated by a stupid little commentary which doesn't tell us who the painting's subjects are, but does state that the painting \"challenges our accepted notions of gender\". What drivel. Not even a 10-year-old would be challenged, though they might well like the painting. </p> <p>This show is a bit of a ragbag. Some of it is laughable, some laudable, some of it irrelevant and some of it really captures a time. In the end, it is just another anthology. But, like the century itself, it had its moments. </p> <p>\u0095 Painting the Century is at the National Portrait Gallery, London WC2 (0207- 312 2463), until February 4 2001.</p>",

Sir John concludes that the arguments put forward by Mike O' Connor, director of the millennium commission, to refuse to pay out the cash \" are just the sort of circumstances to justify... seeking an accounting officer direction,\" according to a memorandum placed in the Commons library. The conclusion 10 days in advance of the publication of the report by the national audit office into the \u00a31bn Millennium Dome fiasco will put further pressure on Mr Smith and Lord Falconer, the cabinet office minister responsible for the dome, to consider their positions. The memo reveals that the commission met in a state of panic on May 22, when it was asked to hand out an extra \u00a338.6m to save the dome. The memo says that the New Millennium Experience Company's letter demanding the cash claimed that it would become insolvent that day, forcing the dome's immediate closure unless it got the cash. Mr Smith and eight other commissioners forced Mr O'Connor to hand out a total of \u00a376m extra aid to keep the dome solvent in May and September . Mr O'Connor authorised a further \u00a3103m from lottery funds this year to keep the dome afloat. The report, out on Thursday week, will detail how the fiasco unfolded over the last year and who was responsible. Mr O'Connor's letter reveals that the company had told the commission it would become bankrupt on May 22 with debts totalling \u00a3200m.

It's really not surprising that I should favour vests now, is it?\"</p> <p>Vests are fine for women with flat chests, but for women with big breast, bras are essential for comfort.

The shinbone was replaced with a titanium implant. </p> <p>She underwent chemotherapy, but less than a year later doctors at the Royal Orthopaedic hospital in Birmingham told her that the diagnosis was wrong and she did not have cancer. </p> <p>It emerged that she had a harmless bone cyst and most of her surgery and treatment had not been needed. </p> <p>The leg implant caused constant stress fractures and pain, so she had to have her leg amputated above the knee in September 1996. </p> <p>The unnecessary chemotherapy caused permanent damage to her kidneys for which she still takes medication, reduced sensation in her hands and feet and damage to her hearing. </p> <p>Yesterday Birmingham health authority confirmed it had settled her claim. The authority said in a statement: \"The health authority did admit liability some time ago and has not been contesting the case. We are sorry for what has happened and wish her well for the future.\" </p> <p>The saga is just the latest in a series of misdiagnosed cancer cases in which patients with benign conditions have been forced to undergo mutilating operations and harmful chemotherapy. </p> <p>Three weeks ago Jennifer Cormack, who went through more than a dozen operations, including a double mastectomy, after being wrongly diagnosed with breast cancer, won \u00a3345,000 compensation at the high court in London. </p> <p>Ms Gilbert, a college sports lecturer who also works as a disability equality trainer, said she had later learned that a report detailing shortcomings in the pathology service at Birmingham orthopaedic hospital had been leaked to a newspaper seven years before her misdiagnosis. </p> <p>\"I was very angry because they had taken my life away as it was then, all for no reason,\" she said. \"Doctors knew there were inadequacies with the pathology department. </p> <p>\"What has happened to me shouldn't happen in vain and I very much hope the regularity with which these clinical mistakes are occurring is being recognised and that something is done about it.\" </p> <p>She said it was \"particularly frustrating to see that the NHS are not learning from their mistakes\" and producing an effective system to identify errors and staff who consistently make mistakes. </p> <p>Since her leg was amputated four years ago, Ms Gilbert has worn an artificial limb. But she still has to use crutches or a wheelchair some days. </p> <p>Her solicitor, Julia Hurstfield of the Manchester law firm Pannone &amp; Partners, said that while \u00a31.2m was a large sum of money, it was to compensate her not only for the pain and suffering relating to the misdiagnosis but also for the ongoing treatment resulting from the chemotherapy, for the provision of an artificial limb for the rest of her life - a conservative estimate is around \u00a3300,000 - special adaptations to her home, physiotherapy costs and potential loss of earnings. </p> <p>Ms Gilbert, who married a surveyor in 1998, lectures in sport at Barnsley and Harrogate colleges.

Her solicitor, Julia Hurstfield of the Manchester law firm Pannone &amp; Partners, said that while \u00a31.2m was a large sum of money, it was to compensate her not only for the pain and suffering relating to the misdiagnosis but also for the ongoing treatment resulting from the chemotherapy, for the provision of an artificial limb for the rest of her life - a conservative estimate is around \u00a3300,000 - special adaptations to her home, physiotherapy costs and potential loss of earnings. Ms Gilbert, who married a surveyor in 1998, lectures in sport at Barnsley and Harrogate colleges. She is also a National Coaching Foundation tutor. Claims: Hospitals accused Errors in cancer diagnoses October Jennifer Cormack , 63, who underwent 14 operations before learning she never had breast cancer, won \u00a3345,000 in the high court. She endured a double mastectomy, seven reconstructive breast procedures, a thyroidectomy and two hernia repairs. She also had a hysterectomy after problems with the cancer drug tamoxifen, and one of her silicone implants burst. June Carenza Lewis , 37, a member of Channel 4's Time Team, is suing an NHS trust after learning that the removal of both her breasts was unnecessary. She was one of seven patients who suffered \"serious consequences\" when their conditions were misdiagnosed by an elderly locum histologist. January Seamus Kinsella , 37, was awarded \u00a3112,000 damages in an out-of-court settlement after a hospital removed three quarters of his stomach in the mistaken belief that he had cancer. When he became ill again, soon after the operation, it was discovered that he was suffering from a condition that can be treated with drugs. April 1999 Bryan Atkinson , 60, a businessman, is suing a hospital after being told he was dying of cancer. For 37 weeks he thought he was terminally ill until a biopsy showed his inoperable tumour was only an inflamed bowel.",

In addition, strict rulings made after their trial in 1993 set out terms for a wide-ranging injunction banning the media from revealing any details about their rehabilitation or printing photos of them taken after a certain date. Last night a spokeswoman for Merseyside police refused to comment on Mr Bulger's remarks. \"The welfare of the two teenagers are the responsibility of their carers and it is not really appropriate for us to discuss comments made on television,\" she said. After it emerged that Mr Bulger would not qualify for legal aid to fund his appeal, a victims' support group, Mothers Against Murder and Aggression (Mama), announced it was planning a celebrity concert in aid of James's family. Dee Warner, of Mama, said: \"You could say you shouldn't take the law into your own hands but if the law worked for the victims rather than the criminals there wouldn't be these vigilante attacks.

      "body": "<p>Congratulations to Joan Smith for her defence of atheism against the woolly minded mutterings of the Archbishop of Canterbury (So the British have become atheists. Thank God for that, October 30).</p> <p>The collapse of religious belief does not mean the collapse of morality. Nor does rejection of the fantasy of an after-life necessarily presage a new age of self-interest and materialism. On the contrary, it is a necessary first step to moral responsibility. Human beings make their own fate, and have no outside power to appeal to when things go wrong. In a life bounded by the certainty of death we learn to value achievements and ties that will outlast us, whether at work, in our relationships with families and friends, or in our wider social activities. This is an incentive to altruism, not selfishness.</p> <p>The decline in religious belief in developed liberal societies is inevitable, necessary and thoroughly healthy.<br><b>Ian Willmore</b><br>London<br>ianw@foe.co.uk</p> <p>I'm usually all for anti-clerical rants, but Joan Smith gives non-believers a bad name. Having correctly targeted the \"archbishop's conflation of godlessness and immorality\", she scores an own goal by conflating anti-clericism and atheism and resorting to that rhetorical chestnut of setting up a single example of religious belief (after-life) and treating all possible convictions as equivalent.</p> <p>I would like to point out to Ms Smith that one does not deconstruct fallacies: one exposes them. One deconstructs (false) binary oppositions, of which there are several in her analysis. She opposes Christians to atheists, which is offensive to Muslims, Jews Hindus, Buddhists and agnostics alike.<br><b>Jason Annadani </b><br>London<br>jason_annadani@yahoo.com</p> <p>Joan Smith is spot on. For years my life was ruined by Catholic guilt and rendered utterly bleak by religion. Frequent visits to the confessional only increased my anxiety and depression, until one day a priest told me: \"You'll go to hell, you will.\"</p> <p>What a relief that was.

      "bodyText": "Congratulations to Joan Smith for her defence of atheism against the woolly minded mutterings of the Archbishop of Canterbury (So the British have become atheists. Thank God for that, October 30). The collapse of religious belief does not mean the collapse of morality. Nor does rejection of the fantasy of an after-life necessarily presage a new age of self-interest and materialism. On the contrary, it is a necessary first step to moral responsibility. Human beings make their own fate, and have no outside power to appeal to when things go wrong. In a life bounded by the certainty of death we learn to value achievements and ties that will outlast us, whether at work, in our relationships with families and friends, or in our wider social activities. This is an incentive to altruism, not selfishness. The decline in religious belief in developed liberal societies is inevitable, necessary and thoroughly healthy. Ian Willmore London ianw@foe.co.uk I'm usually all for anti-clerical rants, but Joan Smith gives non-believers a bad name. Having correctly targeted the \"archbishop's conflation of godlessness and immorality\", she scores an own goal by conflating anti-clericism and atheism and resorting to that rhetorical chestnut of setting up a single example of religious belief (after-life) and treating all possible convictions as equivalent. I would like to point out to Ms Smith that one does not deconstruct fallacies: one exposes them. One deconstructs (false) binary oppositions, of which there are several in her analysis. She opposes Christians to atheists, which is offensive to Muslims, Jews Hindus, Buddhists and agnostics alike. Jason Annadani London jason_annadani@yahoo.com Joan Smith is spot on. For years my life was ruined by Catholic guilt and rendered utterly bleak by religion. Frequent visits to the confessional only increased my anxiety and depression, until one day a priest told me: \"You'll go to hell, you will.\" What a relief that was. Finally the whole pointlessness of religion was brought home to me and I went to my doctor who prescribed a Prozac lookalike. The result? More peace than I had known for years and the ability to be far more altruistic than I ever was as a Christian. Doctors are far more effective than priests - I've found out first hand. Mike Clutten Leicester Anyone can, as Joan Smith has done, create their own fantasy about \"god\" and rightly say He, She or It, does not exist.

      "bodyText": "Staying at the Discount Motel, short-term memory loss victim Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) approaches receptionist Bert (Mark Boone Jr). \"Hi,\" he mumbles through a half-inch of Plexiglas. \"Uh, Mr Shelby - 304.\" Bert glances up. \"What can I do for you, Leonard?\" \"I don't know. I think I may have asked you to hold my calls.\" \"You don't know?\" \"Well, I think I may have. I'm not too good on the phone.\" \"Right, you said you liked to look people in the eye when you talked to them.\" \"Yeah.\" Bert narrows his eyes. \"You don't remember saying that?\" \"Well, that's the thing. I have this condition.\" \"Condition?\" \"It's my memory.\" \"Amnesia?\" \"No, no, it's different from that. It's short-term. I know who I am, I know all about myself. It's just... since my injury, I can't make new memories. Everything fades. If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started. Next time I see you I'm not going to remember this conversation. I don't even know if I've met you before. So, if I seem strange or something, then...\" Leonard hesitates before finishing his sentence. \"Have I told you this before?\" Bert gives a small shrug. \"Yeah. I don't mean to mess with you, Leonard. It's just so weird. You don't remember me at all?\" \"No.\" \"We've talked a bunch a times.\" Leonard half-smiles. \"I'm sure we have.\" See also: LA Confidential, The Terminator, Psycho (1960) Don't see also: Psycho (1998) Pointless trivia: Several of Guy Pearce's songs were used on the soundtrack to the 1991 film The Hunting, in which he also starred.",

      "trailText": "<p>So the FA has grasped the nettle and gone foreign. No matter what people say, Eriksson's just what England need - provided he doesn't change his mind again.</p>",
      "byline": "David Lacey",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The expected choice of Sven-Goran Eriksson to coach England from next July should be a matter for relief with trepidation and mild rejoicing. Relief that the wilder speculation concerning Kevin Keegan's successor has proved untrue, a natural fear of the unknown and pleasure that the national side may, from next summer, be picked by a man whose football credentials are impeccable.</p> <p>When the name of Johan Cruyff entered the equation it was time to start worrying. As it is, the Football Association has gone for the studious Swedish coach of Lazio who has a string of championships in three countries to his credit and is widely respected throughout the game. If tactical acumen, common sense and an ability to command the respect of the world's leading players count for anything, the FA may be on to a winner.</p> <p>Yet in going for a foreign coach to run the national squad it is still taking an enormous gamble, not so much with the future success of the England team but with the reaction of the country as a whole to the idea of having a foreigner in charge. Obviously foreign, professorial types are the flavour of the moment. The FA could not get Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, so it is going for the next best thing.</p> <p>The notion might seem old-fashioned but some fans may feel that, while it is one thing to have French coaches running Arsenal and Liverpool, where there are large complements of overseas players, it will be quite another to have the England team picked and organised by a Swede.</p> <p>In the 21st century this should not matter. After all, an Englishman, George Raynor, took Sweden to a World Cup final 42 years ago, so maybe they owed us one.</p> <p>Eriksson, moreover, would appear ideally suited to combine his experience in Europe with the affection for English football shared by most northern European coaches. He would doubtless take office praising the high quality of the players available to him as well as the exciting string of up-and-coming youngsters queuing for a chance in the national side.</p> <p>The reality is that Eriksson would take over the squad much as a new head teacher arrives at a problem school.

      "bodyText": "The expected choice of Sven-Goran Eriksson to coach England from next July should be a matter for relief with trepidation and mild rejoicing. Relief that the wilder speculation concerning Kevin Keegan's successor has proved untrue, a natural fear of the unknown and pleasure that the national side may, from next summer, be picked by a man whose football credentials are impeccable. When the name of Johan Cruyff entered the equation it was time to start worrying. As it is, the Football Association has gone for the studious Swedish coach of Lazio who has a string of championships in three countries to his credit and is widely respected throughout the game. If tactical acumen, common sense and an ability to command the respect of the world's leading players count for anything, the FA may be on to a winner. Yet in going for a foreign coach to run the national squad it is still taking an enormous gamble, not so much with the future success of the England team but with the reaction of the country as a whole to the idea of having a foreigner in charge. Obviously foreign, professorial types are the flavour of the moment. The FA could not get Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, so it is going for the next best thing. The notion might seem old-fashioned but some fans may feel that, while it is one thing to have French coaches running Arsenal and Liverpool, where there are large complements of overseas players, it will be quite another to have the England team picked and organised by a Swede. In the 21st century this should not matter. After all, an Englishman, George Raynor, took Sweden to a World Cup final 42 years ago, so maybe they owed us one. Eriksson, moreover, would appear ideally suited to combine his experience in Europe with the affection for English football shared by most northern European coaches. He would doubtless take office praising the high quality of the players available to him as well as the exciting string of up-and-coming youngsters queuing for a chance in the national side. The reality is that Eriksson would take over the squad much as a new head teacher arrives at a problem school. He would need to sort out those with genuine talent from the ones who have learning difficulties. Above all he would need to organise whatever is left of England by then into a team capable of achieving the basics of good passing and movement. Reaching the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea is far from impossible, despite England's poor start, but the idea of winning it is an idle dream. The FA believes that it is more realistic to concentrate on building a side for Euro 2004, in Portugal, and the 2006 World Cup in Germany. Just what kind of legacy Eriksson would inherit depends on the FA's ability to achieve a reasonable strength of continuity in the team over the coming eight months. Eriksson would take up his post full-time on July 1 next year, by which time England will have played another three World Cup qualifiers against Finland and Albania in March and Greece in June. Unless, therefore, the FA manages to obtain his services part-time for these games Eriksson will start in the midst of a wake or an awakening. So much depends on Peter Taylor, the present caretaker, getting a sufficiently strong performance from England in their friendly against Italy in Turin a fortnight tomorrow to give the team a platform from which to resume operations early next year. Taylor has already indicated his intention of giving some of the younger players a taste of full international football and will draw on his recent three years with the England Under-21 team to bring this about. If he can successfully blood the likes of West Ham's Joe Cole, he would have done the next man no small favour. Eriksson, meanwhile, has been reported as saying that, if he took the England job, he would like David Platt as his assistant. There would be a certain logic in this. Platt, England captain under Graham Taylor, was coached by Eriksson at Sampdoria where a strong relationship developed between the two. For the FA it will be more important to establish the time scale of Eriksson's mission to restore England to a position of respect not enjoyed by the national side since they went into the 1970 World Cup as holders and co-favourites with Brazil.

A glance through them was enough to unnerve anybody uncertain of how we will cope with the ever-increasing demands being placed on the NHS, the national pension fund and manufacturers of slacks with elasticated waistbands. </p> <p>Manchester United's hero at Old Trafford was 34-year-old Teddy Sheringham. At Upton Park, meanwhile, Newcastle's 67-year-old manager Bobby Robson praised the performance of 34-year-old Robert Lee saying, \"He played like Beckenbauer\" (who is getting on himself). For the home side Stuart Pearce (38) was outstanding. \"I love having him around the place,\" said the Hammers boss, Harry Redknapp. Who can blame him? After all, it's always nice when at least one person in the dressing room gets your reference to Bob Stokoe's trilby. </p> <p>Before the Merseyside derby Everton's Walter Smith made his contribution by saying that 33-year-old Paul Gascoigne should be playing for England and at Villa Park John Gregory did boostering duties on behalf of Paul Merson, aged 32. There is surely enough here to suggest that, far from being orange, the future is a distinguished grey. </p> <p>The notion that the demographics of the Premiership mirror that of society is borne out statistically. For example, in the 1990 FA Cup final the average age of the Manchester United and Crystal Palace starting line-ups was around 25 years and 11 months. A decade later when Aston Villa took on Chelsea there was a preponderance of thirtysomethings on the pitch and the average age had risen to roughly 28 years and four months. If this trend carries on at the same rate, by the end of the century most of the players trotting out at Wembley in May will be well into their fifties. </p> <p>Yet, while the rest of the country is getting to grips with the changes - increasing the provision of nursing facilities, stockpiling Crimplene and churning out more and more hours of nostalgia TV - football has characteristically ignored the evidence and carried on in its time-honoured whippersnapper-worshipping fashion. </p> <p>Witness the predictable outpourings that greeted Kevin Keegan's resignation. Once again we heard how it was critically important to get the youth structure right and introduce young players into the side earlier. Yet as a strategy for the future this is frankly about as likely to improve things as taking to the streets demanding the return of hand-knitted goalkeeping jerseys. Investing in youth football is a piece of absurd short-termism because, to put it bluntly, in 50 years' time there will not be enough young people left in the country to make up a team, never mind a squad. </p> <p>Instead of wasting its days on reactive endeavours such as constructing imitations of the Australian and French academies, the FA should go proactive and put all its effort into finding some way to harness the power of the grey wave. Money must be funnelled away from youth football and into the veterans' game for it is surely from here that the national team of the future will be drawn. </p> <p>Our approach to coaching, too, must be radically altered. Praising Sheringham's display on Saturday, the Southampton boss Glenn Hoddle came over all Jim Morrison observing, \"A set of curtains opens in your mind when you are older and you begin to read the game better.\" This mystical change, rather than speed and stamina, is what we should build our system around. A player of 66 plainly cannot sprint on to a through-ball like a man of 22 but, if he is able to peep through those velvet drapes of perception and see where the ball is going to be in five, 10 or even 15 minutes' time, you can bet he'll be in position to receive it, even if he has to use his free bus pass to get there. </p> <p>The FA should also be lobbying Fifa for rule changes that will influence the game in favour of our new style of play. Allowing defenders to use golf carts to carry them up to the opposition penalty area for set plays, for instance, or moving kick-off times to more pensioner-friendly hours such as 6.30 in the morning. </p> <p>Whatever steps Lancaster Gate decides to take, it is obvious we must stop living in the juvenile-fixated past and come to terms with our rapidly balding population. England is entering the Age of the Third Age. Youth is yesterday's thing. The only way for English football to go forward is to look backwards. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Before the Merseyside derby Everton's Walter Smith made his contribution by saying that 33-year-old Paul Gascoigne should be playing for England and at Villa Park John Gregory did boostering duties on behalf of Paul Merson, aged 32. There is surely enough here to suggest that, far from being orange, the future is a distinguished grey. The notion that the demographics of the Premiership mirror that of society is borne out statistically. For example, in the 1990 FA Cup final the average age of the Manchester United and Crystal Palace starting line-ups was around 25 years and 11 months. A decade later when Aston Villa took on Chelsea there was a preponderance of thirtysomethings on the pitch and the average age had risen to roughly 28 years and four months. If this trend carries on at the same rate, by the end of the century most of the players trotting out at Wembley in May will be well into their fifties. Yet, while the rest of the country is getting to grips with the changes - increasing the provision of nursing facilities, stockpiling Crimplene and churning out more and more hours of nostalgia TV - football has characteristically ignored the evidence and carried on in its time-honoured whippersnapper-worshipping fashion. Witness the predictable outpourings that greeted Kevin Keegan's resignation. Once again we heard how it was critically important to get the youth structure right and introduce young players into the side earlier. Yet as a strategy for the future this is frankly about as likely to improve things as taking to the streets demanding the return of hand-knitted goalkeeping jerseys. Investing in youth football is a piece of absurd short-termism because, to put it bluntly, in 50 years' time there will not be enough young people left in the country to make up a team, never mind a squad. Instead of wasting its days on reactive endeavours such as constructing imitations of the Australian and French academies, the FA should go proactive and put all its effort into finding some way to harness the power of the grey wave. Money must be funnelled away from youth football and into the veterans' game for it is surely from here that the national team of the future will be drawn. Our approach to coaching, too, must be radically altered. Praising Sheringham's display on Saturday, the Southampton boss Glenn Hoddle came over all Jim Morrison observing, \"A set of curtains opens in your mind when you are older and you begin to read the game better.\" This mystical change, rather than speed and stamina, is what we should build our system around. A player of 66 plainly cannot sprint on to a through-ball like a man of 22 but, if he is able to peep through those velvet drapes of perception and see where the ball is going to be in five, 10 or even 15 minutes' time, you can bet he'll be in position to receive it, even if he has to use his free bus pass to get there. The FA should also be lobbying Fifa for rule changes that will influence the game in favour of our new style of play. Allowing defenders to use golf carts to carry them up to the opposition penalty area for set plays, for instance, or moving kick-off times to more pensioner-friendly hours such as 6.30 in the morning. Whatever steps Lancaster Gate decides to take, it is obvious we must stop living in the juvenile-fixated past and come to terms with our rapidly balding population. England is entering the Age of the Third Age. Youth is yesterday's thing. The only way for English football to go forward is to look backwards. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Boro's latest setback - Saturday's 2-1 defeat at Ipswich - deepened the gloom; the visitors were outclassed and their leading scorer of the last two seasons, the disillusioned Hamilton Ricard, was substituted after 32 minutes.

Just like it was at Boro a few years ago. </p> <p>\"Somebody at the club has to realise something has got to be done.

Robson has spent \u00a378m on new personnel since taking the reins in 1994. He may have recouped over \u00a344m but, with players' wages of up to \u00a360,000-a-week, a return of two promotions and a highest top-flight finish of ninth place in 1999 hardly represents value for money. The side are crying out for the kind of spirit typified by the manager during his playing days. </p> <p>\"We could understand all the glamourous signings when we were looking to raise the profile, but we've seen so many people come here for the money,\" says Nichols. \"There's no patience any more.\" </p> <p>Inevitably, the policy of buying big for instant success has nullified the impact of the club's youth academy. If Robson had a fully fit squad from which to choose, the England under-21 striker Andy Campbell would have a \u00a363,000-a-week Croatian, an out-of-form Colombian, a \u00a34m Cameroonian and \u00a35.5m worth of Brian Deane and Noel Whelan ahead of him in the pecking order. </p> <p>\"After six years under Robson, it's difficult to name one home-grown player to have come through and established himself in the first team,\" said Nichols. \"The academy's up and running, but where's the motivation for a youngster?\" </p> <p>Given that Boro reached two cup finals the last time they were relegated, in 1997, the suggestion that their top scorer Alen Boksic may have been rested at Ipswich with tonight's tie in mind will hardly have Teesiders sleeping easier. </p> <p>\"It's not a must-win game, but the Worthington Cup is always the best route into Europe,\" added Robson. \"If you offered me a slightly worse finishing position in the league than last year and the Worthington Cup, I'd take it. </p> <p>\"My own resolve is still strong.

On Sunday night, Gurtu's band featured three Indians and two Africans, with the London-based stars Najma Aktar and Nitin Sawhney in guest slots. </p> <p>Though the references were different, the single-set gig was a triumph for the same reasons Gurtu's shows usually are - the immense variety of textures and polyrhythms he can generate on his own, but more fundamentally for the group sound he inspires, which can make just about any instrumentation sound like a big percussion section. But there was a crucial extra ingredient - the powerful singing and hypnotic presence of Sabine Kabongo, the Zairean singer. </p> <p>Kabongo's gliding high-register lines, reverberating low notes and Gurtu-echoing chatters and exclamatory sounds combined with the Cameroon bass-player Hilaire Penda's dancing counter-melodies kept the African element of the programme not just strong, but seamlessly blended with the more melodically oblique and rhythmically ambiguous Asian core. The guest appearances were glitzy and diverting, but inevitably rather perfunctory set against the focused power of the African Fantasy programme. </p> <p>The delicacy and clarity of Najma's remarkable voice was arresting in the quiet opener to a ballad composed jointly by Gurtu and his classical singer mother, Shoba, but the song ran out of steam. Sawhney came on to play a luxurious and unexpected Spanish feature for acoustic guitar, then developed an expressive exchange of vocalised percussion sounds in duet with Gurtu. </p> <p>But it was the group pieces, ranging from richly coloured tapestries of temple music (using Gurtu's unique palette of bells, gongs, distantly mysterious booms, running-water effects and tiptoeing footfalls), to Weather Report-like orchestral funk and staccato Asian-fusion themes reminiscent of the leader's projects with John McLaughlin, that brought the crowd to its feet for encores. </p> <p>Gurtu's easy cohabitation with the music of his roots as well as American jazz gives his accompaniments an exhilaratingly bumpy energy, the meticulous precision of Indian percussion patterns at high speeds constantly nudged and disrupted by explosive cymbal sounds and whiplash offbeats. There was hardly a duff melody in nearly two hours of music, with Kabongo's voice investing already capriciously inventive material with sinewy twists and dives. </p> <p>World music without a cliche in earshot. </p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>The problem</strong></p> <p>I have a very busy, sometimes stressful job that I often don't like. This is probably due to the fact that I don't like anyone I work with and I feel underpaid and used. I also feel uneasy there - the environment and ethos are not \"me\". </p> <p>My friend and I have decided for a change and are moving to Leeds. She has found herself a job already, but cannot live there until I have found one, but I just can't find the time or energy to throw myself into finding a new job.</p> <p>I keep wondering, should I just hand in my notice so I can search properly or continue in the busy job taking double the amount of time, trying to snatch sneaky days off for interviews, with the whole process taking painfully long. Am I being rash and stupid if I hand my notice in first without having a job to go to? </p> <p><strong>The solution</strong></p> <p>I think you know what you should do, but need some reassurance that you are doing the right thing. You don't like your job, don't like your colleagues, you're underpaid, starting to make mistakes at work, don't like the work environment and spend four hours every day commuting. No wonder you are stressed, tired and lack the energy to job-hunt! </p> <p>You are in an impossible situation and you know it - you want to and need to get out, but the demands of your job mean that you can't. As you yourself say, if you packed the job in you could search properly and be less stressed and tired. Is \"this rash and stupid\"? Under the circumstances, it sounds rather sensible to me. Packing your job in would allow you the space and time to sit back and re-evaluate your career and want you want, as well as allow you to apply for jobs and go to interviews without the whole process taking a 'painfully long time'.</p> <p>The only things holding you back are financial considerations and concern about how this will look to future employers. On the second point, it is possible that some employers will wonder why you packed the job in, or favour someone who is currently employed.

      "bodyText": "The problem I have a very busy, sometimes stressful job that I often don't like. This is probably due to the fact that I don't like anyone I work with and I feel underpaid and used. I also feel uneasy there - the environment and ethos are not \"me\". My friend and I have decided for a change and are moving to Leeds. She has found herself a job already, but cannot live there until I have found one, but I just can't find the time or energy to throw myself into finding a new job. I keep wondering, should I just hand in my notice so I can search properly or continue in the busy job taking double the amount of time, trying to snatch sneaky days off for interviews, with the whole process taking painfully long. Am I being rash and stupid if I hand my notice in first without having a job to go to? The solution I think you know what you should do, but need some reassurance that you are doing the right thing. You don't like your job, don't like your colleagues, you're underpaid, starting to make mistakes at work, don't like the work environment and spend four hours every day commuting. No wonder you are stressed, tired and lack the energy to job-hunt! You are in an impossible situation and you know it - you want to and need to get out, but the demands of your job mean that you can't. As you yourself say, if you packed the job in you could search properly and be less stressed and tired. Is \"this rash and stupid\"? Under the circumstances, it sounds rather sensible to me. Packing your job in would allow you the space and time to sit back and re-evaluate your career and want you want, as well as allow you to apply for jobs and go to interviews without the whole process taking a 'painfully long time'. The only things holding you back are financial considerations and concern about how this will look to future employers. On the second point, it is possible that some employers will wonder why you packed the job in, or favour someone who is currently employed. But this can easily be explained by a short statement in your covering letter about your need to relocate to be with your partner. One or two employers might still be wary, but most will simply accept it. As for the finance, maybe you could get a part-time job somewhere to tide you over. Or see this time off as an investment into your health, career and future. Put like that, even if it takes a few months to get yourself sorted, it would seem a wise investment. \u0095 Dr Sandi Mann is author of Psychology Goes to Work (Purple House) and Managing Your Boss in a Week (Hodder &amp; Stoughton).
