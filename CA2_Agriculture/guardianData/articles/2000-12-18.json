A free-kick from Danny Murphy shortly before half-time not only ended United's two-year unbeaten home run in the Premiership but offered Arsenal an opportunity to close the gap at the top to three points at Tottenham tonight. A lot of statistical dust was swept away by yesterday's result.

      "body": "<p>After a difficult week, in which G\u00e9rard Houllier's handling of his squad had been called into question, he was able to celebrate his 100th match in sole charge of Liverpool with one of the outstanding victories of the season. By masterminding the first league win over Manchester United at Old Trafford in almost two years, he was able to provide the firmest of ripostes to those who suspect him of being an egghead, a bit of a cold fish and perhaps secretly unsympathetic to players of the highest talent. </p> <p>His handling of Michael Owen and Robbie Fowler has come in for particular criticism, and Liverpool's surprising defeat by Ipswich at Anfield last week, when he left Emile Heskey on the bench, was seen as proof of his inability to master the psychological and strategic intricacies of player-rotation. Lurking in the background is the memory of his angry reaction to the mistake by David Ginola which cost France their participation in the 1994 World Cup, when Houllier was the national coach. </p> <p>Even before yesterday Sir Alex Ferguson would have been an unlikely subscriber to such criticisms. He knows that Old Trafford has a lot to thank the Liverpool manager for. It was Houllier's advice, given at a time when he was technical director of the French football federation, that persuaded Eric Cantona to give English football a try. The friendship between them then sustained the adventure, thus unlocking the door that had stood between United and the championship for a quarter of a century. </p> <p>Yesterday's match will almost certainly not, as the Stretford End swiftly pointed out, lead to Liverpool winning anything this season. But it should lay to rest any fears that Houllier cannot cut it as a Premier League manager. \"We had a plan, a very strict tactical plan,\" the Frenchman said. \"You don't come to play here at Old Trafford without a plan.\" Would he say what it was? \"No. We might want to use it again next time.\" But he was courteous enough to give a clue. \"We denied them a lot of things today,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Their midfield defended very well,\" Ferguson confirmed, \"and their two wide ones [Nick Barmby and Danny Murphy] worked their socks off. But plenty of people have come here and tried that.\" Unsurprisingly Ferguson's view was that the lack of accuracy in United's passing had been the chief contributor to their downfall. But Houllier must have dreamed up something special in order to keep David Beckham and Ryan Giggs so quiet for 90 minutes. </p> <p>Beckham, who wore a white woolly hat during the kick-in and a pair of black gloves for the match itself, even though it was not a particularly cold day, spent virtually all the match in a withdrawn position on the right of midfield, inviting Denis Irwin to make the overlaps and put in the crosses but seldom himself venturing into areas from which he might have caused damage. Giggs proved early on that he had the beating of Markus Babbel but Liverpool's cover was so diligent that he was never able to turn his mastery into chances. </p> <p>Above all, at the heart of the midfield battle was the 20-year-old Steven Gerrard, almost a decade younger than Roy Keane but, on the day, fully the equal of the United captain in that priceless combination of hardness, industry and creativity. \"Tactically Stevie is interesting,\" Houllier observed, \"but he's not a finished player yet. Sometimes he's still a bit too hasty in his passing. That's something Keane doesn't do any more.\" But, starting with a brilliant tackle on Giggs in the seventh minute, Gerrard's presence in the vital areas was immense and he even found time to shepherd the newcomer Igor Biscan. </p> <p>In front of them the 22-year-old Emile Heskey gave a master class in the art of strong centre-forward play. With head, chest and feet he bought his defenders time to regroup and presented his fellow attackers with intelligent passes that should have been rewarded with further goals. \"He gives some length to the game,\" Houllier said, \"and when he gets the ball he's always going to be a threat. That's what we bought him for. He's learning fast.\" </p> <p>Perhaps playing to the image of the cavalier Frenchman, Houllier lamented the inability of his team to win the match with a goal from open play. But there were plenty of consolations. As he pointed out, Gerrard and Heskey were among no fewer than 11 Englishmen who started the game, all of them young and six of them in Liverpool shirts. \"I think that may be a record for the Premiership, no?\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Millwall may have risen to the top of the Second Division, but the snacks on sale at their ground remain firmly rooted in the relegation zone. \"Who ate all the pies?\" is a question seldom posed at the New Den, as processed meat products seem as likely to leave the ground inside a black bin bag as inside a football fan. </p> <p>This was just one of the problems faced by Millwall's multi-millionaire chairman Theo Paphitis in BBC2's Back To The Floor, for which he was persuaded to leave the boardroom to find out about League football at meat-and-gristle level. </p> <p>\"You've got a cack range of beers, and a cack range of pies,\" said one critic of his savoury snacks. Worse, this trenchant critique came from one of Millwall's own fans. Bury supporters, visiting the New Den for a 4-0 pasting, were less charitable. Some fairly negative word of mouth (and stomach) meant takings at the away end on the day of Bury's visit, when Theo helped on the refreshments kiosk, were less than impressive. </p> <p>Money was lost, in fact, which must have been a novel experience for Theo, who as owner of shops such as Rymans, La Senza and Contessa, has built his fortune on giving the public exactly what it wants, in the way of knickers, paper clips and novelty Homer Simpson-shaped pencil sharpeners. </p> <p>If it is of any comfort to him, the sales resistance of the Lancashire visitors may not have been entirely a quality issue. There is a definite north-south snack divide. I remember being at a match in Burnley some years ago with some West Ham fans who ordered meat pies and were presented with the Lancashire version: a grey tennis ball of beef mince set in a peppery jelly in a pork-pie style crust. Delicious in Haslingden, but to the denizens of Dagenham, an affront. Similar probably applies in reverse, so it may have been simply the unfamiliarity of the snacks on offer that caused Theo's target audience to give his wares a wide berth. </p> <p>Alternatively, the Bury fans may have got hold of a preview tape of the programme, and seen the bit where Theo proposes to his fellow directors that staff be allowed to take unsold food home to eat.

      "bodyText": "Millwall may have risen to the top of the Second Division, but the snacks on sale at their ground remain firmly rooted in the relegation zone. \"Who ate all the pies?\" is a question seldom posed at the New Den, as processed meat products seem as likely to leave the ground inside a black bin bag as inside a football fan. This was just one of the problems faced by Millwall's multi-millionaire chairman Theo Paphitis in BBC2's Back To The Floor, for which he was persuaded to leave the boardroom to find out about League football at meat-and-gristle level. \"You've got a cack range of beers, and a cack range of pies,\" said one critic of his savoury snacks. Worse, this trenchant critique came from one of Millwall's own fans. Bury supporters, visiting the New Den for a 4-0 pasting, were less charitable. Some fairly negative word of mouth (and stomach) meant takings at the away end on the day of Bury's visit, when Theo helped on the refreshments kiosk, were less than impressive. Money was lost, in fact, which must have been a novel experience for Theo, who as owner of shops such as Rymans, La Senza and Contessa, has built his fortune on giving the public exactly what it wants, in the way of knickers, paper clips and novelty Homer Simpson-shaped pencil sharpeners. If it is of any comfort to him, the sales resistance of the Lancashire visitors may not have been entirely a quality issue. There is a definite north-south snack divide. I remember being at a match in Burnley some years ago with some West Ham fans who ordered meat pies and were presented with the Lancashire version: a grey tennis ball of beef mince set in a peppery jelly in a pork-pie style crust. Delicious in Haslingden, but to the denizens of Dagenham, an affront. Similar probably applies in reverse, so it may have been simply the unfamiliarity of the snacks on offer that caused Theo's target audience to give his wares a wide berth. Alternatively, the Bury fans may have got hold of a preview tape of the programme, and seen the bit where Theo proposes to his fellow directors that staff be allowed to take unsold food home to eat. The idea is vetoed because of the dangers of food poisoning. A wise decision, when you consider the lethal possibilities of stadium food entering the non-football-going food chain. You can understand it, though, if the Bury boys decided to give Theo's snacks a miss. Following Bury is bad enough, without coming down with a case of the docker's trots.

It was not until the 89th minute that Youssef Chippo tested the Derby goalkeeper Mart Poom, although that did not stop Gordon Strachan trying to put a favourable spin on a sorry Saturday that dropped his side into the bottom three. \"Two months ago we weren't playing as well as this, so things are going in the right direction,\" the Coventry manager said. \"I believe that when these players get a wee break in front of goal then they'll have more confidence and we'll go up the league.\" Smith was more succinct. \"Everybody was rubbish,\" he said. That Strachan also tried to implicate Matt Messias, making his Premiership debut as a referee, in his side's defeat smacked of an attempt to deflect responsibility for the mess Coventry are in.",

It is the most determined effort to revive the peace process since mid-October, when contact was broken off because of the Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza.</p> <p>The two sides share a feeling that if they do not reach a deal by January 20, when Bill Clinton leaves the White House, the bloodshed could continue for months.</p> <p>At least four Palestinians were killed overnight and yesterday; in all, 330 people have died so far, mostly Palestinian. In the past week Israeli hit squads have killed leaders of Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement and Islamist militants almost daily.</p> <p>The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, faces a deadline of his own: he is standing for re-election on February 6 and the opinion polls suggest that he will have not a ghost of a chance unless he can conjure up a peace agreement.</p> <p>The odds against him will be especially high if his opponent proves to be the former prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who is trying to recapture the leadership of the rightwing Likud party.

      "bodyText": "Israeli and Palestinian negotiators leave for Washington today, 12 weeks after their peoples' descent into bloody confrontation, to try to squeeze a Middle East peace deal out of the final days of the Clinton administration. The delegations will hold separate talks with US officials, starting tomorrow. It is the most determined effort to revive the peace process since mid-October, when contact was broken off because of the Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza. The two sides share a feeling that if they do not reach a deal by January 20, when Bill Clinton leaves the White House, the bloodshed could continue for months. At least four Palestinians were killed overnight and yesterday; in all, 330 people have died so far, mostly Palestinian. In the past week Israeli hit squads have killed leaders of Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement and Islamist militants almost daily. The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, faces a deadline of his own: he is standing for re-election on February 6 and the opinion polls suggest that he will have not a ghost of a chance unless he can conjure up a peace agreement. The odds against him will be especially high if his opponent proves to be the former prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who is trying to recapture the leadership of the rightwing Likud party. It will become clear this week whether the legal obstacles to Mr Netanyahu standing in the prime ministerial election can be overcome. Yesterday Mr Arafat said he would be willing to meet Mr Barak if this week's Washington talks developed enough momentum. \"If it is needed, why not?\" he told reporters. \"But we have to prepare for this meeting, to have a strong platform.\" He was speaking after 11 Israeli MPs visited his Gaza headquarters. It was the most public encounter since the Palestinian intifada erupted on September 28, and followed a week of secret discussions between the sides But the small flicker of optimism created by the apparent willingness of both sides to revive the negotiations was qualified by Mr Barak, who repeated Israel's insistence that the violence must end first. Palestinian officials played down speculation in Israeli newspapers that the two sides had made enough progress to convene a summit. The Palestinians blame the collapse of the Camp David summit last July for bringing popular frustration with the peace process to the boiling point, and are jittery about embarking on another high-profile meeting unless they are confident of a deal. Yasser Abd Rabbo, who will be part of the Palestinian team of three at the talks in Washington tomorrow, said the sides were not even close to that point. \"We cannot promise. There is no progress achieved and the talks we have had with Israelis are just exploring where each of us stands,\" he said. \"It should be clear that a summit is not for negotiations but for signing.\" He held out the possibility of direct talks with the Israeli teams at Washington, however. The negotiators are expected to pick up where Camp David left off, building on the verbal understandings reached about the size and borders of the Palestinian state. According to the newspaper Ha'aretz, Israeli and US officials have recently presented the Palestinians with a proposal which revives the Camp David talks in offering to swap land in Israel proper for three large blocks of Jewish settlements in the West Bank. These are understood to include Gilo, south of Jerusalem, now ringed by Israeli tanks after it was shot at by Palestinian gunmen from the nearby town of Beit Jalla. But the reported proposal contains much the Palestinians will find impossible to swallow: waiving the right of return for refugees, for example, a right which is as central to Palestinian identity as the rights over Jerusalem. On the issue of Jerusalem, the point on which the Camp David summit broke down, the new proposals offer the Palestinians sovereignty over the inner areas and a corridor through Arab East Jerusalem to the Haram al-Sharif, the Muslim holy siteover which the uprising occurred. Although more generous than those at Camp David, the proposals falls far short of the Palestinian demand for Israeli withdrawal from all parts of the city occupied since 1967. The plan is vague, too, on the dispensation for Haram al-Sharif, which is also sacred to Jews as Temple Mount, the site of their destroyed temple.

      "body": "<p>Christmas might come early for Labour in Falkirk. This Thursday, the byelection which the party once dreaded now looks as though it could pass quietly, obscured by tinsel and dampened by poor turnout.</p> <p>It should have been a contest to rival the great byelection battles of recent years. The seat has been offered up by Dennis Canavan, the rebel Labour MP, who split from the party in 1999 and took his constituents with him, winning an independent seat at Holyrood with the new Scottish parliament's biggest majority.</p> <p>When he announced in October that he would resign the Falkirk West seat at Westminster, the anxiety in Labour ranks was palpable. The party's poll ratings were at their lowest in Scotland for a generation and Mr Canavan's standing in the community appeared unassailable. The Scottish National Party positioned itself to move in for the kill.</p> <p>But then Donald Dewar died and within weeks, Mr Canavan called a second press conference to announce that he had been asked to re-join Labour then a third to say he was resigning after all. The man so admired locally for his principles and plain talk had stopped making sense.</p> <p>Then Labour coasted through the Anniesland byelection and opted for a pre-Christmas contest, the SNP started to slip in the polls, and, suddenly, Falkirk was looking less like a Waterloo and more like a straight fight.</p> <p>\"Labour's strategy in Falkirk now is not to make a big deal of it,\" said Malcolm Dickson, a lecturer in politics at Strathclyde University. \"It's the way they played Anniesland and it means they are now confident that a similar strategy will work in Falkirk West. There's a sense in which Labour feels it is doing enough without having to convince voters to beat off a challenge from the SNP .\"</p> <p>And one of the biggest questions of the campaign so far has been what happened to the SNP challenge. The party appears subdued, showing none of the fighting spirit it displayed in Ayr and Hamilton South. And the campaign has only come alight in recent days after the SNP challenged last week's ITV programme with the prime minister and won the right to a similar primetime broadcast.</p> <p>\"Something, somewhere has gone wrong for the SNP in the last couple of months,\" said Mr Dickson. \"They have been unable to sustain their national position and they have been unable to make significant inroads into Labour. The pres sure in Falkirk is now on the SNP rather than Labour.</p> <p>\"They performed badly in Anniesland. They may have got a 6% to 7% swing in their direction but that is the worst they have performed in a Scottish byelection for 18 years. I suspect that after Anniesland they may be unwilling to throw a huge amount at this byelection. I think that in private they simply want to get it out of the way.\"</p> <p>The SNP is quick to dismiss such suggestions. Roseanna Cunningham, the party's byelection campaign manager, said they had been hitting hard in the constituency, but she would not predict how they might do.</p> <p>The nationalists' candidate, David Kerr, a 27-year-old TV producer, insists that Falkirk is within the nationalists' grasp, but the words he uses to describe the challenge are measured.</p> <p>\"The people of Falkirk have already made the break with New Labour,\" he said. \"That does not automatically mean they will come to the SNP but we are out there, working to build that bridge of trust to allow those voters to see the SNP as their new political home.\"</p> <p>Falkirk sits at Scotland's heart. Rich in history, it has been plagued by many of the country's modern problems. The iron foundries have been replaced by other forms of industry, but unemployment is higher than average and there are large pockets of deprivation. Locally, the most pressing issues have been the proposed transfer of services from the local hospital, and the fate of debt-ridden Falkirk football club.</p> <p>Mr Canavan served Falkirk West as MP for 25 years, and while he has gone to ground since his double u-turn, his presence still looms large.</p> <p>Publicly, Labour does not address \"the Canavan factor\". But the party's replacement has been packaged as a man with a mind of his own.

      "bodyText": "Christmas might come early for Labour in Falkirk. This Thursday, the byelection which the party once dreaded now looks as though it could pass quietly, obscured by tinsel and dampened by poor turnout. It should have been a contest to rival the great byelection battles of recent years. The seat has been offered up by Dennis Canavan, the rebel Labour MP, who split from the party in 1999 and took his constituents with him, winning an independent seat at Holyrood with the new Scottish parliament's biggest majority. When he announced in October that he would resign the Falkirk West seat at Westminster, the anxiety in Labour ranks was palpable. The party's poll ratings were at their lowest in Scotland for a generation and Mr Canavan's standing in the community appeared unassailable. The Scottish National Party positioned itself to move in for the kill. But then Donald Dewar died and within weeks, Mr Canavan called a second press conference to announce that he had been asked to re-join Labour then a third to say he was resigning after all. The man so admired locally for his principles and plain talk had stopped making sense. Then Labour coasted through the Anniesland byelection and opted for a pre-Christmas contest, the SNP started to slip in the polls, and, suddenly, Falkirk was looking less like a Waterloo and more like a straight fight. \"Labour's strategy in Falkirk now is not to make a big deal of it,\" said Malcolm Dickson, a lecturer in politics at Strathclyde University. \"It's the way they played Anniesland and it means they are now confident that a similar strategy will work in Falkirk West. There's a sense in which Labour feels it is doing enough without having to convince voters to beat off a challenge from the SNP .\" And one of the biggest questions of the campaign so far has been what happened to the SNP challenge. The party appears subdued, showing none of the fighting spirit it displayed in Ayr and Hamilton South. And the campaign has only come alight in recent days after the SNP challenged last week's ITV programme with the prime minister and won the right to a similar primetime broadcast. \"Something, somewhere has gone wrong for the SNP in the last couple of months,\" said Mr Dickson. \"They have been unable to sustain their national position and they have been unable to make significant inroads into Labour. The pres sure in Falkirk is now on the SNP rather than Labour. \"They performed badly in Anniesland. They may have got a 6% to 7% swing in their direction but that is the worst they have performed in a Scottish byelection for 18 years. I suspect that after Anniesland they may be unwilling to throw a huge amount at this byelection. I think that in private they simply want to get it out of the way.\" The SNP is quick to dismiss such suggestions. Roseanna Cunningham, the party's byelection campaign manager, said they had been hitting hard in the constituency, but she would not predict how they might do. The nationalists' candidate, David Kerr, a 27-year-old TV producer, insists that Falkirk is within the nationalists' grasp, but the words he uses to describe the challenge are measured. \"The people of Falkirk have already made the break with New Labour,\" he said. \"That does not automatically mean they will come to the SNP but we are out there, working to build that bridge of trust to allow those voters to see the SNP as their new political home.\" Falkirk sits at Scotland's heart. Rich in history, it has been plagued by many of the country's modern problems. The iron foundries have been replaced by other forms of industry, but unemployment is higher than average and there are large pockets of deprivation. Locally, the most pressing issues have been the proposed transfer of services from the local hospital, and the fate of debt-ridden Falkirk football club. Mr Canavan served Falkirk West as MP for 25 years, and while he has gone to ground since his double u-turn, his presence still looms large. Publicly, Labour does not address \"the Canavan factor\". But the party's replacement has been packaged as a man with a mind of his own. Eric Joyce is a former army officer who attacked the armed forces for being sexist, racist and snobbish. \"I believe in the Labour party programme but if the interests of the local constituents conflict with that, it is for me to go down to Westminster with the concerns of the constituency,\" he said. \"I have a reasonably good record of saying what I think.\" Mr Joyce believes that the party has done enough to persuade the Canavan defectors to come back into the fold. \"What I'm hearing from people is, 'I will vote for you but I expect you to stand up for the local people like Dennis did'.\" On the streets, locals still talk of Mr Canavan with affection and he will remain their MSP. But Mr Dickson believes his influence is being overstated. \"You could ask what happens to the people who voted for Canavan last year,\" he said. \"But were they really voting for him or for what they felt was the 'proper' Labour candidate? I think they were seeing Labour and Canavan together. I suspect the vast majority will go back to Labour.\"",

      "body": "<p>Oliver Smyth is chortling gently as he plays with his Lego on the floor. Blue eyes wide open, he grasps a farmyard fence and rushes to give it to his mother. One of the family cats slips in and he scampers after it, caught up in the joy of being two years old. </p> <p>The Smyths' home is testament to a much longed for child, from the numerous photos and jumbled toys to the letter fridge magnets spelling his name. </p> <p>Yet, when he arrived, his mother, Rosie, a 29-year-old nursing assistant for an NHS community trust in the west country, was granted just 16 days' maternity leave, in contrast to the 18 weeks given to most new mothers. </p> <p>The reason is that Oliver is adopted and, at present, adoptive parents have no statutory right to paid maternity leave. </p> <p>It is an issue which the government last week announced it will address after a three-month consultation on the green paper on work and parents. The trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, admitted that he had been unaware of the discrepancy and signalled his determination to change this. </p> <p>Rosie and her husband Nigel, who are waiting to adopt again, do not want her to return to work again after six weeks as she was forced to through financial necessity. </p> <p>And so, in the first case of its kind, they have successfully used the Human Rights Act to claim that their child was being discriminated against, and force her employer to offer adoptive parents the same maternity leave as birth parents. </p> <p><strong> Sense of injustice</strong><br> </p> <p> Rosie's realisation that her employers, an NHS community health trust, would treat her differently to birth mothers came when she approached them after hearing that she could adopt Oliver as a four-month-old, in the spring of 1998. </p> <p>The issue of maternity leave had not occurred to her before - she had been too preoccupied with three failed IVF attempts. She was surprised by the response. \"I was told there was a draft policy agreement that gave six weeks on half pay but that, since the board had not approved it, it was up to individual managers to choose whether to implement it.\" </p> <p>Her managers did not implement the draft policy but offered 10 days \"special leave for family reasons\". An appeal to a second manager, who had adopted a child, brought a further six days. But the offer fell a long way short of the eight weeks on full pay and 10 weeks on half pay offered to birth mothers. </p> <p>With Oliver's arrival imminent, Rosie and Nigel, 33, felt they were in no position to fight. Rosie borrowed money and enjoyed a mere six weeks with her baby before she was forced to return to work part-time. She said: \"My bosses offered me more unpaid leave - they weren't going to force me back before I was ready. But money was.\" </p> <p>Leaving Oliver was, she admitted, very hard. \"It wasn't fair and I thought it was particularly unfair on him. I thought the trust was discriminating against him as a baby. He was denied the chance to have a full-time mum for the same amount of time as any other baby,\" she said. </p> <p>The sense of injustice continued to rankle and it did not help when a colleague became pregnant. \"All the time I was aware that she and her baby would have 18 weeks together while my baby and I just had three weeks,\" she said. With the realisation that she would want to adopt again, she began 18 months of campaigning, writing to politicians and her union, Unison. </p> <p>She argued that maternity leave was important to allow her to bond with her baby.

      "bodyText": "Oliver Smyth is chortling gently as he plays with his Lego on the floor. Blue eyes wide open, he grasps a farmyard fence and rushes to give it to his mother. One of the family cats slips in and he scampers after it, caught up in the joy of being two years old. The Smyths' home is testament to a much longed for child, from the numerous photos and jumbled toys to the letter fridge magnets spelling his name. Yet, when he arrived, his mother, Rosie, a 29-year-old nursing assistant for an NHS community trust in the west country, was granted just 16 days' maternity leave, in contrast to the 18 weeks given to most new mothers. The reason is that Oliver is adopted and, at present, adoptive parents have no statutory right to paid maternity leave. It is an issue which the government last week announced it will address after a three-month consultation on the green paper on work and parents. The trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, admitted that he had been unaware of the discrepancy and signalled his determination to change this. Rosie and her husband Nigel, who are waiting to adopt again, do not want her to return to work again after six weeks as she was forced to through financial necessity. And so, in the first case of its kind, they have successfully used the Human Rights Act to claim that their child was being discriminated against, and force her employer to offer adoptive parents the same maternity leave as birth parents. Sense of injustice Rosie's realisation that her employers, an NHS community health trust, would treat her differently to birth mothers came when she approached them after hearing that she could adopt Oliver as a four-month-old, in the spring of 1998. The issue of maternity leave had not occurred to her before - she had been too preoccupied with three failed IVF attempts. She was surprised by the response. \"I was told there was a draft policy agreement that gave six weeks on half pay but that, since the board had not approved it, it was up to individual managers to choose whether to implement it.\" Her managers did not implement the draft policy but offered 10 days \"special leave for family reasons\". An appeal to a second manager, who had adopted a child, brought a further six days. But the offer fell a long way short of the eight weeks on full pay and 10 weeks on half pay offered to birth mothers. With Oliver's arrival imminent, Rosie and Nigel, 33, felt they were in no position to fight. Rosie borrowed money and enjoyed a mere six weeks with her baby before she was forced to return to work part-time. She said: \"My bosses offered me more unpaid leave - they weren't going to force me back before I was ready. But money was.\" Leaving Oliver was, she admitted, very hard. \"It wasn't fair and I thought it was particularly unfair on him. I thought the trust was discriminating against him as a baby. He was denied the chance to have a full-time mum for the same amount of time as any other baby,\" she said. The sense of injustice continued to rankle and it did not help when a colleague became pregnant. \"All the time I was aware that she and her baby would have 18 weeks together while my baby and I just had three weeks,\" she said. With the realisation that she would want to adopt again, she began 18 months of campaigning, writing to politicians and her union, Unison. She argued that maternity leave was important to allow her to bond with her baby. Sympathy was offered, but the message was the same: maternity leave, in the words of the Department of Social Security, was offered \"to protect women from the exertions of work immediately prior to giving birth and to allow a period of rest immediately following the exertion of childbirth\". And then she had a breakthrough. On the advice of a judge, she contacted a family lawyer who told her that her employer, as a public authority forced to adhere to the European convention on human rights, may have breached article 14 of the Human Rights Act. Deprived of mother's time \"The article is quite broad and bans discrimination on grounds not only of sex, race and social origin but birth,\" explained Chris Hall, of Crosse &amp; Crosse solicitors. \"Oliver, as an adopted child, appeared to have been discriminated against because he was being deprived of time with his mother that a child with a birth mother would have had.\" A human rights barrister at Matrix backed up this view, arguing that it was given force because article 8 of the act, covering the right to family life, also appeared to have been flouted. Faced with being sued under the Human Rights Act, the trust changed its mind and offered six weeks' paid leave at nine-tenths of her salary followed by 12 weeks on half pay plus the equivalent of statutory pay. The policy may not have been quite equal to that for birth mothers, and Oliver may not have had his mother at home for 18 weeks, but at least it would apply to their next adopted child. The chief executive of British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering, Felicity Collier, said: \"This is an issue that we are concerned about as it restricts the number of people coming forward to adopt. The success of adoption will depend on how successful those first few months are. When a child joins your family, it is vitally important there is time for at least one parent to be at home with the child.\"",

Staff will get the full effect of the increases from April 1, 2001. The Department of Health said the pay increases mean a newly qualified nurse's salary will rise from a minimum of \u00a314,890 to at least \u00a315,445. An experienced staff nurse on a grade E position will see his or her wages increase from at least \u00a315,920 to \u00a316,510 a year. And nurse consultants could see their pay rise to a maximum of \u00a345,050, compared to \u00a343,440 this year. The government has also accepted in full the recommendations of the Doctors' and Dentists' Pay Review Body (DDRB) of a 3.9% increase, which means newly qualified consultants will start on \u00a350,810, rising to a maximum of \u00a3128,935 for the most experienced.",

Efforts by senior Conservatives to present a united front on social issues were undermined when the shadow foreign secretary, Francis Maude, when asked whether there was an internal party split between a dominant hard right and centrists seeking a more inclusive approach, talked of a small minority spreading \"poison\". Mr Maude said: \"I have no idea where it is coming from, but whoever is doing it is inflicting grave damage on the party. I actually find it breathtaking that some people apparently think that it is appropriate or helpful to spread poison in this way... \"If a small minority, wherever they may be, are indulging in wrecking tactics of a really self-indulgent and stupid form then they will pay a penalty for it.\" Talk of poison and the row over Mr Hague's stance on race stem from Tory fears that, four years after John Major's meltdown, they are heading for another election disaster. Mr Hague would not be deflected from criticising the 1999 Macpherson report into the Lawrence affair for \"going too far\" in charging the Metropolitan police with institutional racism, added Mr Maude. \"Obviously there is no question about William or any of the rest of us being racist,\" said Mr Maude. \"But we do have to say things as we see them, and if we see that the pendulum swung after the Macpherson report too far, much too far... then it is our duty to say so and we are not going to be frightened off doing so because of this kind of intemperate attack on us.\" Ann Widdecombe, the shadow home secretary, also rallied to Mr Hague's defence, calling the race card accusations \"utter nonsense\". The pair spoke from a position of near-desperation for a leadership which needs to cut Labour's 179-seat majority in 1997 back to below 100 if the opposition - and Mr Hague - are to be in with a chance next time. Thursday's Gallup poll for the Daily Telegraph confirmed that the Tories have slipped back to 15 points behind Labour and back to where they were before the September fuel blockades briefly put them in front for the first time in eight years. That plight is enough to explain Mr Hague's reversion to law and order populism among Labour ministers and officials. Clare Short, the development secretary, told ITV's Jonathan Dimbleby: \"It's very sad but I have no absolutely no doubt that this is calculated by William Hague to play the race card. Sadly, he's obviously decided to play the race card to help him win his election and I think it is a very sad day for the country.\" Aides to Mr Portillo denied reports that the shadow chancellor privately called Thursday's keynote speech on law and order \"a disgrace\". But the statement they issued on his behalf was carefully enough worded to suggest ill-ease. Whatever their views on Mr Hague's tactics, Tory MPs are alarmed that fighting of the kind that hamstrung John Major's leadership is again breaking out as the expected May election looms.",

Gone were the whistles, the fake 10,000 peseta notes and the flying mobile phones. The only things flying in Luis Figo's direction this weekend were the carnations that rained down from the stands.

      "bodyText": "They love Luis Figo in Barcelona. No, really they do - well, half of the city certainly does. On Saturday night the World's Most Expensive Player was back in the Catalan capital as Real Madrid took on Espanyol at Montju\u00efc. And what a difference a couple of months makes. Gone were the whistles, the fake 10,000 peseta notes and the flying mobile phones. The only things flying in Luis Figo's direction this weekend were the carnations that rained down from the stands. Figo was back in Barcelona - and taking corners to boot. There's nothing like screwing Bar\u00e7a to ingratiate yourself with Espanyol's fans, who were keen to remind the Portuguese star that \"not all Catalans are animals\". Figo repaid the compliment too, adding Real Madrid's second goal with a fabulous free kick, after Fernando Morientes had opened the scoring with a fine finish from McManaman's pass.

After the various warnings by the Cragnotti clan during the week, we were certain that Sven-Goran Eriksson was about to be given the Christmas heave-ho and, patriotic sorts that we are, wanted to be the first to belch out a bold 'God Save the Queen' to the new England manager. And so we waited. And waited. And then - Luton being Luton - we were mugged.</p> <p>We weren't the only ones feeling a bit sore after Eriksson's non-arrival, either. Sergio Conceicao - who was sold by Svennis to Parma as part of the Hernan Crespo transfer this summer - was banking on Eriksson's removal so he could return to Rome. \"Why should I not agree about moving back to Lazio?\" he told onefootball.com. \"Why not? This is what football is like nowadays, and I'm not angry with them any more.\"</p> <p>Alas, it seems that our banner, and young Sergio's wishes, will have to wait. Because this afternoon, Lazio president Sergio Cragnotti reiterated his confidence in his coach. \"Sven will remain with us until the end of the season. I will not get tired of saying that,\" he told Gazzetta dello Sport. \"Yesterday we lost because everything is going in Roma's favour and not in ours. The Giallorossi were fortunate.\" And so - considering we escaped with a few bruises - were we.</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"It may seem a bit selfish, but I want to dedicate this to my dog who died two days ago\" - Boca Juniors coach Carlos Bianchi, whose team won the Argentine Apertura championship, prepares to break into a rendition of Old Shep.</p> <p><strong>VILLAINS OF THE PIECE</strong></p> <p>Everybody wants to leave Aston Villa. Apart from chairman Doug Ellis, that is (which is sort of understandable when you think that the club won the league and Big Cup the last time he turned his back). But David James and Gareth Southgate are no Dougs. They want out. In fact, James wants out so badly he's prepared to hold his breath and recreate his 1997 Liverpool form until his face turns blue. Paulo Wanchope sends his love, by the way, David.</p> <p>But Southgate is a prouder man. \"Perhaps if I had been the sort of person to kick up a real stink and mess them about then I might have been sold by now,\" the fat-mouthed England defender said today. \"Players have done that in the past to get what they wanted but I would never do that. While I'm still at the club I will continue to give 100% on the pitch. I feel I am playing as well as I ever have and I just hope the club put a realistic price on my head.\"</p> <p>That's honourable transfer-seeking stuff. Sadly, it doesn't impress team-mate Paul Merson, who today rocked the world of football by speaking for several minutes without mentioning the words 'sorting', 'head', 'demons', 'me', or 'me'. \"David and Gareth are quality players but everyone has a price,\" began his sober analysis. \"Their attitude has been outstanding but you have to think about starting again. You will get money for them and you can bring younger players in.\" These comments will endear Merse even more to the Villa faithful - it wouldn't spoil the effect if we mentioned how he \"feels sorry\" for his chairman, would it?</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>West Ham are set to sign Liverpool striker Titi Camara later today for \u00a32m, according to Teamtalk.</p> <p>Celtic are on the verge of completing the \u00a34m signing of the Mihael Mikic - the man touted as Croatia's answer to Michael Owen (who is the English version of Marian Pahars, who is the male version of Mia Hamm) - reports Planet Football.</p> <p>Hearts have insisted they will not make any further moves for St Johnstone defender Gary Bollan after being warned off by the McDiarmid Park club.</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>Rangers defender Fernando Ricksen today became the first player in Scottish football to be punished by an enquiry using video evidence. The Dutchman was found guilty by the SFA of kicking Aberdeen's Darren Young in a match at Pittodrie in November, and will be suspended for his side's games against Hibernian and St Mirren.</p> <p>Bradford goalkeeper Matt Clarke has rejected Jim Jefferies' claim that he was left out of the Premiership clash with Newcastle because of a loss of form. \"If they had dropped me for the right reasons I would have held my hands up and accepted it,\" said Clarke. \"I have played 40 Premiership games for Bradford and have been getting all these rave reviews. Then the new manager comes in and says I have lost form. Basically the excuses for leaving me out are rubbish.\"</p> <p>Huddersfield manager Lou Macari is facing a minimum 12-match touchline ban if he is found guilty of manhandling a fourth official during Saturday's 1-1 draw at Portsmouth. Macari appeared to shove Barry Wade in the chest after an incident between Town midfielder Simon Baldry and Ceri Hughes.</p> <p>Former Dundee United chairman Jim McLean will have to ask permission from the SFA if he ever wants another football job in his home country. McLean resigned as chairman after he struck BBC reporter John Barnes during an interview after a home defeat against Hearts.</p> <p>Aston Villa midfielder Lee Hendrie is to appeal to the FA over his sending-off by referee Andy D'Urso against Manchester City. Hendrie was given an instant red card for foul and abusive language. \"I don't think that the punishment I received fitted the crime,\" Hendrie said today. \"I thought it was a very harsh decision and that what I did was a yellow card offence at most.\"</p> <p>Arbroath have pleaded with the SFA not to throw them out of the Scottish Cup after fielding two suspended players - Stephen Mallan and John McAulay - in their 1-0 first-round win over Montrose. \"We would settle for a replay with a fine as I'm sure that's the least Montrose would want,\" said a club spokesman.</p> <p><strong>TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO</strong></p> <p>ITV: Football Extra (1.30am) </p> <p>Today is a sad day indeed.

Basically the excuses for leaving me out are rubbish.\" Huddersfield manager Lou Macari is facing a minimum 12-match touchline ban if he is found guilty of manhandling a fourth official during Saturday's 1-1 draw at Portsmouth. Macari appeared to shove Barry Wade in the chest after an incident between Town midfielder Simon Baldry and Ceri Hughes. Former Dundee United chairman Jim McLean will have to ask permission from the SFA if he ever wants another football job in his home country. McLean resigned as chairman after he struck BBC reporter John Barnes during an interview after a home defeat against Hearts. Aston Villa midfielder Lee Hendrie is to appeal to the FA over his sending-off by referee Andy D'Urso against Manchester City. Hendrie was given an instant red card for foul and abusive language. \"I don't think that the punishment I received fitted the crime,\" Hendrie said today. \"I thought it was a very harsh decision and that what I did was a yellow card offence at most.\" Arbroath have pleaded with the SFA not to throw them out of the Scottish Cup after fielding two suspended players - Stephen Mallan and John McAulay - in their 1-0 first-round win over Montrose. \"We would settle for a replay with a fine as I'm sure that's the least Montrose would want,\" said a club spokesman.

In a statement made through their family solicitor, Richard and Gloria Taylor said they were distressed by Mr Hague's comments in a speech last week and a newspaper article he wrote this weekend.

The vast S-class - the biggest ship in the company's fleet, which has a bonnet marginally shorter than the average street - is generally about as close as we get to seeing Russian Zils on British roads. But even the less massive Mercs hardly seem shy and retiring. They don't actually go about with a price tag hanging off the bumper, but something about their unguardedly opulent shapes seems determined to account noisily for every last penny the driver has spent. </p> <p>The new C-class, like its older brothers, still says \"wad\", but it says so a little more decorously. No one will be in any doubt that you pull down some fairly serious annual K, which, I take it, is most of the point of owning one. But at the same time, the famous Mercedes twin headlamps now come in a single, moulded unit that is roughly the shape of a Los Angeles swimming pool and, overall, the car has a softer, more fluid look than the legendary wallets-on-wheels of old. </p> <p>Even now, though, the argument about the tastefulness of purchasing a Mercedes could be thought to begin and end with the hood ornament. The company refers to the new C-class as \"the most aerodynamic saloon in its market segment\". An army of alarmingly qualified technicians has probably spent whole years studying computer-simulated airflow patterns and worrying about turbulence around the boot-catch. Yet at the end of it all, the car still comes out with a wind-resistant cake-decoration slapped onto its bonnet. </p> <p>Once, perhaps, a hood ornament was the height of style and elegance. Now, nothing shouts \"naff\" louder or longer. However pleasing that triple-pointed Mercedes-Benz symbol looks in printed form or in relief along the rim of the boot, as a lump of silver rising out of the bonnet of a car it might as well be a model of a charging horse or a representation of the head of Po from the Teletubbies. There is no Mercedes that would not look immediately classier without one - which is useful consolation when a bored or aggrieved pedestrian eventually snaps yours off, or hits it with a cricket bat. </p> <p>In other respects, the car makes vital advances on the departing C-class (the new one has, for instance, a six-speed fan where the old one had only a measly four-speed). And it scoops up some features that previously you wouldn't have got without shelling out for an S-class. Among no fewer than 20 technical features which the cars share are lamps that light themselves in the dark, sensors that regulate the climate control, and what Mercedes describes, arrestingly, as \"intelligent airbags\" (they gauge the seriousness of the impact, apparently, and fluff up accordingly). </p> <p>Key-janglers beware, however: the C-class is a keyless zone. The nubby end of the plastic remote fob simply plugs into a socket on the dashboard. Clearly, when it comes to turning over an engine, we are now as far from the crank-handle as we ever will be. When you plug in, the car remembers you from last time: it recalls the way you had the seat before and where the steering wheel and the mirrors were. It can probably be set up to comb your hair the way you like it, if you're prepared to spend long enough with the computer and the manual. And when you want to get out, you remove the key - or rather, the fob - and the seat slips back and the steering wheel column retracts to smooth your way. </p> <p>I was bitterly disappointed to discover that my Mercedes (the \"Classic\" version, as opposed to the fancier \"Elegance\" and \"AvantGarde\" versions) did not come fitted with the Linguatronic control system: it is available as an optional extra, but sounds pretty much compulsory to me. This voice-activation device, pioneered by Mercedes, originally operated only the phone, but now extends miraculously to the audio system, including the CD player and the radio. </p> <p>Herein one of the great motoring pleasures - shouting at the radio - graduates from being merely therapeutic to being importantly functional. Just a word from you and the stereo changes tracks or shifts stations, courtesy of some canny software which responds to a number of spoken commands and, who knows, maybe even a range of other commonly used, in-car listener responses such as \"Oh, for goodness sake, leave it, Humphrys\" and \"Don't make me laugh, Hucknall\". </p> <p>By rights, driving the car ought to be entertainment enough. In first gear, the Classic is deceptively sluggish, but it turns out that it's just giving you an opportunity to straighten your tie and ready yourself for the engine's startling power and pace in higher gears. The C-class has, incidentally, a six-speed gearbox, which is at least three more than you really need in a place like London, but its sensitive gradations will come in handy pretty much everywhere else. The gearstick responds to the merest pressure - a motion so dreamy that I almost forgot the bauble on the bonnet. The most astonishing refinements in the C-class are the ones beneath its skin. </p> <p><strong> The lowdown</strong><br> <strong> Mercedes-Benz C180 Classic </strong> </p> <p><strong>Price: </strong> \u00a320,740 </p> <p><strong> Top speed: </strong> 130mph </p> <p><strong> Acceleration: </strong> 0-62 in 11 seconds </p> <p><strong> Consumption: </strong> 29.7 mpg </p> <p><strong> At the wheel: </strong> Nasser Hussain </p> <p><strong> On the stereo: </strong> Craig David </p> <p><strong> En route for: </strong> Derby Novotel</p>",

Among no fewer than 20 technical features which the cars share are lamps that light themselves in the dark, sensors that regulate the climate control, and what Mercedes describes, arrestingly, as \"intelligent airbags\" (they gauge the seriousness of the impact, apparently, and fluff up accordingly). Key-janglers beware, however: the C-class is a keyless zone. The nubby end of the plastic remote fob simply plugs into a socket on the dashboard. Clearly, when it comes to turning over an engine, we are now as far from the crank-handle as we ever will be. When you plug in, the car remembers you from last time: it recalls the way you had the seat before and where the steering wheel and the mirrors were. It can probably be set up to comb your hair the way you like it, if you're prepared to spend long enough with the computer and the manual. And when you want to get out, you remove the key - or rather, the fob - and the seat slips back and the steering wheel column retracts to smooth your way. I was bitterly disappointed to discover that my Mercedes (the \"Classic\" version, as opposed to the fancier \"Elegance\" and \"AvantGarde\" versions) did not come fitted with the Linguatronic control system: it is available as an optional extra, but sounds pretty much compulsory to me. This voice-activation device, pioneered by Mercedes, originally operated only the phone, but now extends miraculously to the audio system, including the CD player and the radio. Herein one of the great motoring pleasures - shouting at the radio - graduates from being merely therapeutic to being importantly functional. Just a word from you and the stereo changes tracks or shifts stations, courtesy of some canny software which responds to a number of spoken commands and, who knows, maybe even a range of other commonly used, in-car listener responses such as \"Oh, for goodness sake, leave it, Humphrys\" and \"Don't make me laugh, Hucknall\". By rights, driving the car ought to be entertainment enough. In first gear, the Classic is deceptively sluggish, but it turns out that it's just giving you an opportunity to straighten your tie and ready yourself for the engine's startling power and pace in higher gears. The C-class has, incidentally, a six-speed gearbox, which is at least three more than you really need in a place like London, but its sensitive gradations will come in handy pretty much everywhere else. The gearstick responds to the merest pressure - a motion so dreamy that I almost forgot the bauble on the bonnet. The most astonishing refinements in the C-class are the ones beneath its skin. The lowdown Mercedes-Benz C180 Classic Price: \u00a320,740 Top speed: 130mph Acceleration: 0-62 in 11 seconds Consumption: 29.7 mpg At the wheel: Nasser Hussain On the stereo: Craig David En route for: Derby Novotel",

SMG, which owns the Scottish and Grampian ITV franchises, the Glasgow-based Herald newspaper and the Virgin Radio and TV group, made its first move against SRH 10 days ago, buying a 14.9% stake.

STV argued that Mr Blair was appearing in his capacity as prime minister, not as leader of the Labour party. The broadcaster threatened to contest the order in the Scottish Court of Session before the deadline set by the ITC for compliance, December 20.

It is scheduled to be fitted on the rail network by 2003. Today's report by the health and safety executive (HSE) follows three interim reports and outlines key findings from a 14-month investigation into the disaster. At 8.11am on Tuesday October 5 1999, a Thames train heading for Bedwyn in Wiltshire collided with a Great Western train bound for Paddington station on a stretch of track at Ladbroke Grove, west London. The Thames train had passed through a red signal. The HSE report found that the signals around the area of the Paddington train crash were below industry standard and \"exceptionally difficult\" to read. There were no indications, it said, that the driver of the Thames train, Michael Hodder, deliberately set out to pass the signal, number 109, at red. It had been passed at danger on seven other occasions in the past five years and was one of the top 22 most-passed-at danger signals, said the report. Experts who had looked at signals in the area concluded that \"the complexity of the layout\" and the \"obscuration of the signal aspects by overhead line equipment\" made them difficult to read. The report describes how staff at the signal control centre in Slough in Berkshire tried to prevent the crash when they realised a collision was imminent.

      "bodyText": "Media giant Time Warner has issued an earnings warning, only days after receiving clearance for its merger with AOL. It said earnings for this year would grow by only 11%, instead of the expected 12-13%, due to weak advertising revenue from its cable network. Poor box-office takings from Adam Sandler film Little Nicky also contributed to the slowdown in growth. Walt Disney and News Corporation have posted similar warnings, as an advertising shortfall starts to hit companies' profits. Last week, the \u00a375bn Time Warner and AOL deal was cleared by the Federal Trade Commission, which was the last significant hurdle to completing the joint venture. The Federal Communications Commission is expected to give its consent before New Year. The FTC gave the merger the thumbs-up after both companies promised to open up Time Warner's cable system to competing ISPs before AOL launched its own cable service. Time Warner added that AOL, the largest internet service provider in the US, was expected to post fourth quarter revenues in line with analysts' expectations.",

This is only marginally longer than the 25/1 Scott took over Liverpool/Man Utd yet surely it is vastly less likely to happen. Liverpool, 9/2 outsiders for the match, would have to score at least two more goals than their 4/7 hosts in 45 minutes of football for this bet to come in, obviously much less likely than United scoring two more goals than the visitors.

      "body": "<p>The year 2000 has been a white-knuckle ride by any standards for anyone working in new media. Beginning with dot.com euphoria and an explosion of new businesses, new platforms and new opportunities in the UK, climaxing with the devastating crash of the tech stock market in the spring, followed by a dot.con shakeout and a prolonged comedown. </p> <p>January opened with signs and wonders. The merger of AOL and Time Warner shocked the traditionalists who marvelled that an internet service provider was now big enough to swallow up an old powerhouse. Open, BSkyB's much-maligned interactive home shopping channel, disclosed that its Christmas period sales reached 1m a week and BT Cellnet launched its first internet phone package. Tech stocks soared out of control and the e-commerce outlet <a href=\"http://www.lastminute.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Lastminute.com</a> floated itself at an outrageous valuation of \u00a3700m, becoming the focus of much envious fascination. For weeks we were subjected to Sunday supplement rich lists of the new under-30 millionaires, and Martha Lane Fox (the \"bubbly 27-year-old CEO\" of Lastminute.com) was the most popular after-dinner speaker on the planet. </p> <p>Suddenly the UK was in the grip of its own Silicon Valley-style uprush. Lifestyle portals of all shapes and sizes were springing up everywhere targeting women (<a href=\"http://www.Beme.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Beme</a>), teenage girls (<a href=\"http://www.Wowgo.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Wowgo</a>, <a href=\"http://www.MyKindaPlace.com\" target=\"_NEW\">MyKindaPlace</a>), clubbers (<a href=\"http://www.Ebop.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Ebop</a>), health-freaks (<a href=\"http://www.CickMango.com\" target=\"_NEW\">ClickMango</a>) and generic \"youth\" (<a href=\"http://www.Live4Now.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Live4Now</a>). They employed dozens of staff with important-sounding titles such as \"information producer\" and \"community architect\". Television crews piled down to matchmaking events such as First Tuesday to record the next Marthas and Brents (the green dots) chasing the money men (the red dots). </p> <p>A previously unheard-of Brit tech jet set emerged, made up of such lovelies as the former model Kajsa Leander, the <a href=\"http://www.Boo.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Boo.com</a> co-founder Nathaniel Rothschild and Toby Rowland, son of Tiny and founder of ClickMango, which boasted Joanna Lumley as its figurehead. In fact celebrities were signing up to the gold rush all over the place: Boris Becker (<a href=\"http://www.Sportgate.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Sportgate</a>), Bob Geldof (<a href=\"http://www.Deckchair.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Deckchair</a>, <a href=\"http://www.MyWapWorld.com\" target=\"_NEW\">MyWapWorld</a>), Jonathan Ross (<a href=\"http://www.Toyzone.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Toyzone</a>) and even the Countess of Wessex (5@6). Some of the sharpest heads in media were tempted on to start-ups with golden handshakes and attractive stock options, prompting a \"brain drain\" panic. </p> <p>There were the party poopers who warned of a south sea bubble effect, but who were they to spoil the fun?

      "bodyText": "The year 2000 has been a white-knuckle ride by any standards for anyone working in new media. Beginning with dot.com euphoria and an explosion of new businesses, new platforms and new opportunities in the UK, climaxing with the devastating crash of the tech stock market in the spring, followed by a dot.con shakeout and a prolonged comedown. January opened with signs and wonders. The merger of AOL and Time Warner shocked the traditionalists who marvelled that an internet service provider was now big enough to swallow up an old powerhouse. Open, BSkyB's much-maligned interactive home shopping channel, disclosed that its Christmas period sales reached 1m a week and BT Cellnet launched its first internet phone package. Tech stocks soared out of control and the e-commerce outlet Lastminute.com floated itself at an outrageous valuation of \u00a3700m, becoming the focus of much envious fascination. For weeks we were subjected to Sunday supplement rich lists of the new under-30 millionaires, and Martha Lane Fox (the \"bubbly 27-year-old CEO\" of Lastminute.com) was the most popular after-dinner speaker on the planet. Suddenly the UK was in the grip of its own Silicon Valley-style uprush. Lifestyle portals of all shapes and sizes were springing up everywhere targeting women (Beme), teenage girls (Wowgo, MyKindaPlace), clubbers (Ebop), health-freaks (ClickMango) and generic \"youth\" (Live4Now). They employed dozens of staff with important-sounding titles such as \"information producer\" and \"community architect\". Television crews piled down to matchmaking events such as First Tuesday to record the next Marthas and Brents (the green dots) chasing the money men (the red dots). A previously unheard-of Brit tech jet set emerged, made up of such lovelies as the former model Kajsa Leander, the Boo.com co-founder Nathaniel Rothschild and Toby Rowland, son of Tiny and founder of ClickMango, which boasted Joanna Lumley as its figurehead. In fact celebrities were signing up to the gold rush all over the place: Boris Becker (Sportgate), Bob Geldof (Deckchair, MyWapWorld), Jonathan Ross (Toyzone) and even the Countess of Wessex (5@6). Some of the sharpest heads in media were tempted on to start-ups with golden handshakes and attractive stock options, prompting a \"brain drain\" panic. There were the party poopers who warned of a south sea bubble effect, but who were they to spoil the fun? It was a time of dot-dottiness, when every club in the capital was thronging with young upstarts talking \"strictly confidentially, you understand\" about their \"big idea\". Commissioned in the heat of it, Channel 4's The eMillionaire Show promised to help a member of the public realise their dot.com dream.

But senior army officials denied that, blaming the attack on rebel gunmen. Yesterday, two explosions rocked government buildings in the provincial capital, Banda Aceh. No one was injured, but Indonesia's reformist President Abdurrahman Wahid is scheduled to visit the city on tomorrow. More than 400 people have been killed in Aceh since the truce went into effect June 2 - more than in all of 1999. The conflict has left at least 6,000 people dead in the past decade. With his efforts to negotiate a settlement to the separatist conflict in tatters, President Wahid is under increasing pressure to use massive force to crush the guerrillas. Insiders at the presidential palace say Vice-President Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of Indonesia's founding President Sukarno, is leading a push by several ministers and military hard-liners calling for tougher action. Mrs Megawati was last week photographed wearing a military-style uniform, complete with brass buttons and epaulettes, while greeting guests from the armed forces at the state palace. When he first took office 14 months ago, President Wahid called for negotiations to end the conflict. But now he appears to have caved into the demands of hawks within his government. He has urged the security forces to crack down on rebels in Aceh and Irian Jaya, another restive province in eastern Indonesia, ahead of pro-independence rallies in both regions. About 50 people were recently killed in Aceh in a week of bloodshed and 18 in Irian Jaya before he called for peace. During his visit tomorrow, President Wahid is expected to offer the staunchly Muslim region greater autonomy, including the right to impose Sharia, or Islamic law, and a greater share of revenues from oil and natural gas in the region. But his trip may have little effect. Aceh's provincial governor has demanded 80% of oil revenues, a much higher figure than Jakarta can afford. And rebel leaders say they have no faith in Wahid's promises. \"There is no other option other than independence,\" said Zaini Abdullah, the chief rebel negotiator. \"99% of the people in Aceh are ready to give their money and lives for our cause.\" He claimed the guerrilla army was 5,000 strong, well armed and financed and highly disciplined. Said, the military analyst, warned that an open conflict would lead to a \"bogged down war with so many casualties like in Chechnya,\" where Russian forces have been battling independence fighters for the past 16 months with an incredibly high death toll. The rebels pulled out of peace talks this month, accusing Indonesia's security forces of killing civilians. They said they would not return to negotiations until the violence stopped. New York-based Human Rights Watch said there has been a significant increase recently in human rights abuses in the area. An Acehnese human rights worker, smuggled out of the region by the group, said he escaped from an Indonesian death squad after three of his co-workers were beaten and shot in the head.

More than 6,000 people a year are forced to stay in a hostel because they have no home of their own - two-thirds of this number are in Glasgow. Meanwhile, the Scottish executive has been criticised for apparently failing to meet its own targets on renovating empty homes, a key plank of its homelessness strategy. According to the Scotsman on Sunday, the executive blamed \"a drafting mistake\" for its original promise to bring back into use 900 empty homes by the end of 2000. The executive now says the real target was to re-introduce the 900 homes by 2002 - and its empty homes initiative has already brought back 300 homes this year. The executive has pledged that by 2003 no-one in Scotland should be forced to sleep rough.",

It is the first time Sega has allowed its games to be used by a competitor and heralds a landmark shift away from the battle of proprietary consoles towards multi-platform gaming software. While a company spokesman refused to confirm the move, an insider confirmed that a number of Sega games, including Sonic, were being developed for Nintendo and an announcement would be made over the next week. Sonic, the famous spiky blue hedgehog character, will soon appear alongside Nintendo's Super Mario on teenagers' handheld gameboy machines. Earlier this month Sega signed an agreement with Motorola to create and develop games for its next generation of internet-compatible phones. The shift in strategy is a major factor behind today's news that Sega has lost its European chief executive, Jean Francois Cecillon, the man who masterminded the \u00a350m launch of its Dreamcast console last year. A spokesman said Cecillon had come to the end of a two-year contract and decided to \"pursue other interests in the media and entertainment industries\". His responsibilities have been absorbed by European chief operating officer Kazotoshi Miyake. Mr Cecillon, whom Sega praises for hitting sales targets for Dreamcast, is thought to have been unenthusiastic about the change in strategy towards selling games to competitors and keen to pursue new marketing challenges elsewhere. He has been linked with Universal, the group recently bought by France's Vivendi. Sega's Dreamcast now faces opposition from Sony's recently launched PlayStation 2 console. Two weeks ago Sega was forced to look for a new advertising agency after Bartle Bogle Hegarty resigned its \u00a360m pan-European account to pitch for rival Microsoft's forthcoming X-box gaming system.",

The scale of write-offs will send shockwaves through the banking community and deepen the depression among dot.com operations hoping that 2001 will provide the light at the end of a dark tunnel. The figures, from Bain &amp; Co, underline just how the circle has turned in the space of 12 months and come just days after Breathe.com collapsed with losses of up to \u00a350m. At the start of the year, everyone wanted to be involved in the internet; now everyone is bailing out. An estimated 31,000 workers have lost their jobs and sites such as fuckedcompany.com list thousands of further companies heading for the graveyard. There have been high-profile tragedies - Joanna Lumley and TV chef Anthony Worrall Thompson are among those who lent their names to failed ventures - but now closures are so common they scarcely get reported. Some 90% of internet companies around today are expected to fail in the next three years. Despite the doom amd gloom, media analysts believe there is still some opportunity, albeit limited, for those who can adapt and become media hybrids. Gerry Mulvin from Bain &amp; Co believes that if dot.coms can survive the next six months, tie in their business with other media and find some way of making money, then they may stand a chance of survival. \"The timeframe of disruptive technologies - something that changes the foundations of society, such as electricity, the steam train and computers - has been shortening,\" he said. This explains the gold rush fever of 2000, which was based on the assumption that consumer habits would change and everyone would be shopping, travelling, reading and even dating over the internet. In all, \u00a31bn was invested by venture capitalists on high-tech companies in 2000. A 55% fall this year in the value of the TechMark, the stock exchange for technology-related companies, has had a profound effect on venture capital success rates, as it soon became clear that the bulk of the businesses wouldn't be able to float to give any return on investment. Alarmingly, the \u00a3500m spent on bad investments does not take into account the hundreds of millions of pounds established companies have pumped into their own internet projects this year.

There is a danger that if the focus on programmes is too rigid we won't have the flexibility to respond quickly to breaking stories. Equally if correspondents are always being diverted from their main programmes nothing will have changed - achieving a balance will be the key to success.</p> <p>And strangely some have suggested this is all about dumbing down - if anything it is the reverse. It is an attempt to ensure specialists remain at the heart of our news coverage - specialists who are trusted by the programmes, who can spot spin from substance, but who are also conscious of programme needs.</p>",

That is not to say we are abandoning bi medial working - for a news organisation that deals with radio, TV and now new media we will continue to need broadcasters who can operate comfortably whatever the nature of the output - but we want to deploy correspondents where their skills can be used to best advantage. At the same time we had to deal with a feeling among some in Radio News that they were the losers in the bi-medial revolution - there was a perception that the most senior correspondents would be taken off their bulletins to appear on television - we needed to answer that by giving not just more correspondents to radio but ensuring that some of the most experienced and respected journalists were focussed in that direction. Overall the structural changes in the review are rather less radical than has been suggested - an expanded education team has absorbed welfare, the health team will now cover social services and medical breakthroughs will be covered by a combined science and environment team. More a tidying up than transformation. Will it work? While there are a few who are disappointed, there is genuine enthusiasm among both correspondents and programmes for the principles behind the review and a commitment to make it work. But it is not without risks. There is a danger that if the focus on programmes is too rigid we won't have the flexibility to respond quickly to breaking stories. Equally if correspondents are always being diverted from their main programmes nothing will have changed - achieving a balance will be the key to success. And strangely some have suggested this is all about dumbing down - if anything it is the reverse. It is an attempt to ensure specialists remain at the heart of our news coverage - specialists who are trusted by the programmes, who can spot spin from substance, but who are also conscious of programme needs.",

      "bodyText": "A Chinese labour leader has been sent to a psychiatric hospital for organising a protest against factory layoffs in the eastern province of Jiangsu. His detention came after he was interviewed about the dispute by foreign journalists. Human rights groups in touch with local activists in Yancheng town say that Cao Maobing, an unofficial labour organiser at a silk factory where half the workers had been laid off, is being detained by the police at the town's Number 4 psychiatric hospital. In an interview last week with the Voice of America radio station, Mr Cao, an electrician, said that his independent union wanted to protect workers' rights but not to subvert Communist party rule. According to the Human Rights Information Centre in Hong Kong, he defied the authorities last month by requesting official recognition of the union. The Chinese government usually condemns efforts to organise outside the official trade union framework as undermining \"national stability\" or plotting against the state. China Labour Watch in New York said that it had received telephone calls from his fellow-workers at the Funing silk factory. One reported that the hospital was trying to force Mr Cao \"to take medicine for the insane\". Concern at the use of psychiatric hospitals to silence dissenting voices has begun to spill over into the Chinese press, in spite of the political sensitivity of the subject. A civil servant in Shandong province is demanding compensation for being certified as suffering from \"persistent mental illness\" after she made claims about corruption by her superiors. The case was reported last week by the popular Yangcheng Evening News under the headline: \"Does a work unit have the right to ask for a diagnosis of mental illness?\" By contrast, allegations by the proscribed Falun Gong sect that many of its members have been sent to psychiatric hospitals have not been given press coverage. In official denunciation, of the sect its adherents are frequently described as unstable people who may hurt themselves or others unless restrained. Teng Chunyan, a Chinese citizen resident in the US, was jailed for three years last week for allegedly smuggling information about Falun Gong members held in a psychiatric hospital to the foreign press.",

Earlier this month, its shares were hit when Wall Street Journal owner Dow Jones issued a profits warning, saying that financial advertising was drying up. However, Pearson said today in a trading statement that the Financial Times was producing \"vigorous\" advertising revenue growth and worldwide sales had increased by 11% year-on-year. \"Our businesses are on track to deliver substantial revenue and operating profit growth, in line with expectations,\" Pearson said. Analysts remain sceptical about the continued strength of the financial advertising market, and say that a downturn in the number of stock market flotations could weaken the figures next year. The global media sector is experiencing an across-the-board slump in advertising revenues, with big hitters such as Walt Disney and News Corporation admitting to a decline in turnover. ITV powerhouse Granada Media received a stock market savaging in October when it revealed a fall in advertising income. But Pearson appears to be unaffected, with its FT Internet enterprises set to break-even two years ahead of schedule in 2002. Unique monthly users at the flagship FT.com site have grown from 1.1m in July to 1.7m in November. FT Deutschland has also met the performance of its sister paper by beating its circulation and advertising targets since launching in February. Pearson Education remains one of the biggest money-spinners for the group, with the US higher education business consolidating its market leader position. RTL Group, formed by Pearson's television arm and the TV assets of German media giant Bertelsmann, was also performing \"in line with expectations\". The company owns 65% of Channel 5 and is interested in buying the remaining stake from United Business Media, formerly known as United News &amp; Media.",

Some were successful sportsmen and women like the Olympic fencing champion Laura Flessel, the judo star Djamel Bouras and the swimmer Muriel Hermine; others were old friends of Mr Chirac, including a farm union boss and a hotel manager, from his home constituency of Correze. According to leaked documents, many of those questioned so far have spilled the beans. \"I was hired at the request of Jacques Chirac,\" Marie-Therese Poujade, the wife of a former RPR environment minister, reportedly told police. \"I stayed at home, and I gave the mayor the benefit of my reflections and analyses whenever I saw him.\" An entirely separate investigation headed by a different magistrate, Patrick Desmures, is currently underway into allegations that hundreds of full-time RPR activists were hired by Paris town hall, other public bodies, and friendly companies eager to win city contracts. The two fake jobs scandals, partially revealed two years ago, are among five currently dogging Mr Chirac -- though the people likely to be most affected by them are his four closest senior aides who apparently signed most of the contracts. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the president did not refer to them on television last week. But he did take care to say that as head of state, and therefore responsible for the country's magistrature, he would not be able to respond to any judicial request to come forward as a witness. Several leading lawyers have since remarked that, on the contrary, as head of state he should feel more morally bound than any ordinary citizen to do exactly that.

Either way, Ayodhya is once again a ticking bomb under Indian politics that could explode at any time. Already, the temple issue seems to be acquiring a momentum of its own. Stonemasons at Ayodhya, a sleepy town in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, have been instructed to complete two thirds of the work on a new Hindu temple dedicated to the Lord Ram by the end of March.

Lorraine Large, 21, and a 17-year-old female, who cannot be named for legal reasons, both of Littlehampton, West Sussex, appeared at Crawley magistrates court. District Judge Paul Tain remanded both defendants in custody until Friday when both are due to appear back before the magistrates. Both are charged with attempting to murder Danny, who was found in a pool of blood on a grass verge near Littlehampton seafront at 3am on Friday. He had been stabbed 25 times. Neither spoke except to confirm their identities. Two men, aged 18 and 19, and a 16-year-old girl were released from custody on bail last night. Danny was given a blood transfusion at a local hospital before being transferred to Guys Hospital in London where he remains in a critical but stable condition. The court heard from prosecutor Ann Toynbee that he had now regained consciousness. Officers conducted fingertip searches of the scene, an area close to the sea front known as \"the green\".

      "body": "<p>Whether one regards 2000 as the end of a century or the beginning of one, the year has shown just how little changes in newspapers. British press history repeats itself endlessly, tragedy and farce intermingled. Lessons remain unlearned. Advice goes unheeded. </p> <p>Each new generation - owners or editors, reporters or page designers - repeats past errors with renewed vigour. From the other side, politicians and public make the same criticisms down the years, but inevitably ruin their arguments due to incurable hypocrisy. </p> <p>In a year dominated by arguments about ethics and the alleged dumbing down phenomenon, let's recall these words from the Times. The \"race for mammoth circulations has led ... to a disgraceful lowering of values. The baser instincts are being pandered to, not only in lasciviousness ... but in social attitudes and in conduct as well.\" Such questionable behaviour, said the paper, was engendered by \"newspaper economics,\" which are turning the press into \"predominantly a business enterprise\". </p> <p>That thundering leader was written in 1955, when the Times's front page was all adverts, the Daily Telegraph rarely carried a front-page picture, the Daily Mirror was both serious and saucy, the Daily Sketch was silly and saucy, and the Sunday populars referred to sex with so many euphemisms that it was impossible to know who had done what to whom. </p> <p>It's doubtful if the current Times, now stablemate of the Sun and News of the World, would publish a similar attack today. But its substantive point, that once newspapers become businesses they fall inexorably into bad ways, has long been relevant. How do we resolve the conundrum in which papers assert that they exist for the public good while, in reality, they are businesses seeking private profit? </p> <p>The year's most controversial takeover is a case in point. When Clive Hollick, chief executive of United News &amp; Media, last month sold Express Newspapers in secret to Richard Desmond, a man whose fortune rests largely on pornography, the free-marketeers shrugged. </p> <p>Money makes a nonsense of morality. Mammon rules in the market and objectors to Desmond's ownership on moral grounds find their cries of complaint falling on deaf ears. </p> <p>While Desmond has taken most of the flak, the main fire should be directed at Hollick. He was a poor steward of the Express titles, failing to communicate any sense of vision about the papers either within the organisation or outside. Why then did he bother to buy them in the first place? That same question applies to Trinity's purchase of the Mirror titles, though I am happy to agree that its chief executive, Philip Graf, is certainly in a different league from Hollick. What is troubling is the way in which the Mirror, Sunday Mirror and People are drifting downwards in the circulation tables without any apparent strategy to turn them round. </p> <p>The flagship Mirror has gone into a circulation decline again this year after a reversal of fortune due to an expensive direct mail promotion and energetic editorial initiatives led by an effervescent editor, Piers Morgan. That resurgence was short-lived and Morgan, for all his swagger, has been a different man since February when the revelations emerged about his share-dealing activities with his City Slicker columnists Anil Bhoyrul and James Hipwell. Morgan was swiftly cleared of wrongdoing by Trinity Mirror, although a press complaints commission inquiry, while acquitting him of breaching the editors' code of practice, concluded that he had \"fallen short of the high professional standards\" demanded by the code. </p> <p>Since then, progressing at its normal dead slow speed and leaking injudiciously, a department of trade and industry investigation has provided Morgan's enemies - in other words, the rest of the press - with ammunition that continues to suggest he will eventually be found guilty of something. </p> <p>I doubt that very much. The DTI will discover nothing that Trinity doesn't already know. Graf and chairman Sir Victor Blank showed Morgan great loyalty. They didn't want to lose a talented editor. In the long run, though, even if the DTI gives Morgan a clean bill of health, there cannot be any doubt that he has tarnished his own and his paper's reputation. </p> <p>Here, surely, was a case of Trinity sacrificing ethical purity for business reasons. The need to maximise sales, to get everything that other papers have and more besides, leads inevitably to journalists stretching the truth until it breaks. I detailed a number of examples in the Sunday Times during the year, which has resulted in one swingeing PCC adjudication and several apologies. It is but one example of broadsheets adopting both the news values and the methodology of tabloids, striving just that bit too hard to stand up stories that don't really exist. </p> <p>This trend is infinitely more worrying for the future of our serious press than the use of colour blurbs, celebrity pictures and lifestyle features. Complaints about these examples of so-called dumbing down are largely superficial because, as editors regularly point out, the quantity of quality material is far greater than used to be the case. </p> <p>Papers get bigger by the year, offering an ever wider range of material. Readers now have catholic tastes, and sales figures suggest that the broadsheets have a healthier future than their downmarket cousins. But in seeking a bigger audience they must not lose their credibility by doing as the tabloids do. It was significant that the broadsheets immediately distanced themselves from the News of the World's name-and-shame campaign. </p> <p>Rebekah Wade, appointed as NoW editor in May, took a huge risk after the murder of Sarah Payne by naming people claimed to have been convicted of paedophile offences. This prompted outbreaks of vigilante behaviour and the paper was forced to back down. Wade's aim, to win \"Sarah's Law\", a public register revealing the whereabouts of released paedophiles, is unlikely to be satisfied. </p> <p> Her major change at the NoW has been to tone down its sexual content. Her opposite number at the Sun, David Yelland, has taken a similar approach. The Daily Star's Peter Hill also cleaned up his paper's act. Yet these papers, along with their mid-market rivals, the Daily Mail and Daily Express, still view celebrities of whatever stature, including the royal family, as cannon fodder in the sales war. </p> <p>Perhaps the most glaring example throughout the past 12 months has been the regular use of paparazzi pictures, especially those taken by the ubiquitous Jason Fraser. He would like us to think that most of his victims are complicit, allowing him to take grainy shots as they sunbathe semi-naked on foreign beaches. Maybe some do, but the absence of complaints to the PCC by those who don't, means that papers will go on flouting the code of practice. Editors have been altogether more restrained in their dealings with the monarchy. Prince Charles's media rehabilitation is well under way and Prince William, has enjoyed an unusually long honeymoon with the press. </p> <p>PCC chairman Lord Wakeham has managed to negotiate an arrangement between St James's Palace and editors which appears to be holding. The positive result for the young prince, and the royal family, too, was clear in the picture spreads a couple of weeks ago of his South American adventures. How different from the misguided photographic deal in June, which led first to a bitter struggle between the Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail, and then to the sacking of Prince Charles's press secretary, Sandy Henney. </p> <p>It will be fascinating to see whether a press desperate to capitalise on the glamour of Princess Diana's eldest son will continue to reject paparazzi pictures of him when he starts at St Andrews University. </p> <p>No person, not even the beautiful Liz Hurley, has been the subject of as many headlines, stories and pictures as the prime minister. But Tony Blair has survived a year of growing hostility from the press, which probably reached its height during the summer fuel crisis, to emerge relatively unscathed. He and his wife have fought off invasions into their own privacy by a former nanny (aided by the Mail on Sunday) and into that of baby Leo, born in May. The PCC has yet to draw up guidelines on the press treatment of the Blair infant. </p> <p>Few editors came and went. Wade's NoW arrival cost Phil Hall his job, but he appears to be prospering as Max Clifford's sidekick. In Scotland, there was much more blood on the carpet. Scotsman editor Alan Ruddock went in February, and his successor, Tim Luckhurst, didn't last long. So Rebecca Hardy got the job and her paper, benefiting from a price cut, proved successful enough against the fledgling Business am title. Martin Clarke was sacked from the Daily Record and replaced by Peter Cox of the Sunday Mail. Both titles, also owned by Trinity Mirror, declined slowly month by month. </p> <p>Among the sales successes were the Financial Times, having expanded its foreign publishing, and the Observer under Roger Alton. This was a heartening sign because both titles still adopt the purist view that good journalism counts. Like the Guardian and the Independent titles, they have not appealed to \"baser instincts\", proving that ethics and business can go hand in hand. </p> <p>But all papers face a difficult time next year with the cost of newsprint due to rise and advertising revenue expected to slow. That will put every owner under strain and Desmond may well ask himself the question so many of us have been asking recently: just why has he bought the Express?</p>",

      "body": "<p>Robert Altman is drifting back through the decades. We float past Short Cuts and The Player, past Nashville and MASH, past the war years as a bomber pilot, right back to the heart of his desire. \"It was sex. It was all about good- looking girls and sex ... and all that stuff.\" </p> <p>I have just asked him why he wanted to be a film-maker - a calling, a love of movies, idealism? He starts to talk about moths and flames, how he was always susceptible to the flame. A fascinating nuisance, that flame, he says. His blue eyes seem to be fading to whiteness. Sex was a perk of the job? \"Well it's never a perk, oddly enough. It's probably an obsession. But it doesn't work for you, it works against you.\" </p> <p>Altman is one of the few surviving great American film-makers. He made his name in the 70s, alongside the likes of Martin Scorsese and Francis Coppola who considered themselves, rightly, to be artists. They were not overly interested in box office, certainly not interested in fulfilling a studio mandate. They wanted to show an America that had outgrown the simplicities of the old-fashioned dream - an America fuelled by hypocrisy, drugs, corruption. </p> <p>Altman has just been made a fellow of the British Film Institute - its highest award - and is to be honoured with a two-month retrospective at the National Film Theatre. It's an honour normally bestowed on the dead. </p> <p>A few years ago Altman did look as if he was on his way out. He had what he likes to refer to, casually, as a heart condition. The doctors told this man of huge appetites that he had to cut down - on everything. The fags and drugs had already gone. Then the whisky went. And the daily 20 cups of coffee. Today, he has a glass of water by his side. It remains untouched. He often complains about modern times - what kind of world are we living in when men are frightened to fuck and knock back the whisky? </p> <p>He sits deep into the sofa, his fabulous belly pushed out as far as it will go. He pats it occasionally, with pride, with confidence, with love. He looks like such a kindly old man, with those weepy eyes and soft hands. He is 75 and looking forward. He talks quietly, raggedly, in a lullabye Kansas drawl. </p> <p>Altman redefined the landscape of cinema. Those huge tracking shots, multiple narratives, improvised scenes full of ums and ahs, and hopelessly unformed sentences. He turned the viewer from audience into eavesdroppers, voyeurs. He had a hard time in the 80s when nobody wanted to make his movies, but in the past 10 years has come back with film after film - occasionally great (Short Cuts), often ropy (Pret-a-Porter), always interesting. I want to tell him he's a hero of mine, prostrate myself in front of him, ask him how he's done it. But it would be unprofessional wouldn't it? So I play it cool and tell him I admire his work. </p> <p>While sex may have driven him towards the movies (even his third wife talks about his history of womanising), his priority soon became art. He was already in his 40s when he began making those sprawling epics of American life such as Nashville, The Long Goodbye and McCabe and Mrs Miller. </p> <p>They were often movies without beginning, end and plotline - cinema's equivalent to freeform jazz. When I ask him what he considers his movies to be about, the best he can come up with is the truth. \"I think artists tend to be fairly truthful. What else is there to deal with but the truth?\" </p> <p>He explains that an artist produces original work, and compares it to journalism. \"If you're working for a mandate like yourself, if you have an assignment to do an interview with a person, you can be artistic about it, but it's difficult to be an artist.\" Altman has always loved pricking our little vanities. Don't worry about hurting my pride, I say to him with a smile. \"Oh, I'm not worried about that,\" he says, with his poker face. </p> <p>We're back with sex. There is a wonderful scene in Short Cuts in which Julianne Moore is arguing with her husband, spills wine on her skirt, yanks it off, and irons in anger. Altman shoots her naked from the waist down for five minutes. We're privy to the most furious, sexless row, and all we can focus on is Moore's flaming pubes. It does strange, ambivalent things to us, which is the intention. </p> <p>I tell him that a friend asked why he's so keen on gratuitous nudity. \"Well that's not a bad question ...\" he says. I feel less stupid. \"But it's also not a good question either.\" Deflated again. Altman talks like the characters in his films - stories overlap, sentences are rarely completed. </p> <p>\"The main idea behind showing nudity is that the minute I show you nudity, I can show you whatever I choose to show you. There is no censorship, nothing preventing me from doing this. Which means I can go further than I have gone, and if I don't it's my choice. Does that make sense to you?\" </p> <p>No, not really, I say. He purrs with impatience. \" We-e-ll, I want you to know that I show whatever I choose. It's my choice, and not made by a censor.\" </p> <p>He says that so much of his achievement is due to the courage of the actors. What is courage in an actor? \"Well I think it's some kind of curse that these people get that they can stand up on a stage and take their clothes off, figuratively or not, and say this is me, these are my eyes, this is my tooth.\" That takes a lot of courage.\" He pulls at a dodgy cavity. \"This is who I am, and they just stand there.\" He says he's never had such courage. </p> <p>In a way, his improvisational technique is a supremely democratic form of film-making. But, of course, there is a dictatorial side - he makes his actors explore all their vulnerabilities till they give him what he wants. And then he makes the final decision. He is one of the very few film-makers who can insist on final cut in his movies. There is a price to pay, though - sometimes, as with his adaptation of John Grisham's The Gingerbread Man, the studio give up on it and fails to give it decent distribution. </p> <p>Altman has never won an Oscar.

He almost agrees. \"You can go away and say we're in the river and it's moving all the time. Right now you and I are in this river, and the river's going a million miles an hour.

      "bodyText": "Robert Altman is drifting back through the decades. We float past Short Cuts and The Player, past Nashville and MASH, past the war years as a bomber pilot, right back to the heart of his desire. \"It was sex. It was all about good- looking girls and sex ... and all that stuff.\" I have just asked him why he wanted to be a film-maker - a calling, a love of movies, idealism? He starts to talk about moths and flames, how he was always susceptible to the flame. A fascinating nuisance, that flame, he says. His blue eyes seem to be fading to whiteness. Sex was a perk of the job? \"Well it's never a perk, oddly enough. It's probably an obsession. But it doesn't work for you, it works against you.\" Altman is one of the few surviving great American film-makers. He made his name in the 70s, alongside the likes of Martin Scorsese and Francis Coppola who considered themselves, rightly, to be artists. They were not overly interested in box office, certainly not interested in fulfilling a studio mandate. They wanted to show an America that had outgrown the simplicities of the old-fashioned dream - an America fuelled by hypocrisy, drugs, corruption. Altman has just been made a fellow of the British Film Institute - its highest award - and is to be honoured with a two-month retrospective at the National Film Theatre. It's an honour normally bestowed on the dead. A few years ago Altman did look as if he was on his way out. He had what he likes to refer to, casually, as a heart condition. The doctors told this man of huge appetites that he had to cut down - on everything. The fags and drugs had already gone. Then the whisky went. And the daily 20 cups of coffee. Today, he has a glass of water by his side. It remains untouched. He often complains about modern times - what kind of world are we living in when men are frightened to fuck and knock back the whisky? He sits deep into the sofa, his fabulous belly pushed out as far as it will go. He pats it occasionally, with pride, with confidence, with love. He looks like such a kindly old man, with those weepy eyes and soft hands. He is 75 and looking forward. He talks quietly, raggedly, in a lullabye Kansas drawl. Altman redefined the landscape of cinema. Those huge tracking shots, multiple narratives, improvised scenes full of ums and ahs, and hopelessly unformed sentences. He turned the viewer from audience into eavesdroppers, voyeurs. He had a hard time in the 80s when nobody wanted to make his movies, but in the past 10 years has come back with film after film - occasionally great (Short Cuts), often ropy (Pret-a-Porter), always interesting. I want to tell him he's a hero of mine, prostrate myself in front of him, ask him how he's done it. But it would be unprofessional wouldn't it? So I play it cool and tell him I admire his work. While sex may have driven him towards the movies (even his third wife talks about his history of womanising), his priority soon became art. He was already in his 40s when he began making those sprawling epics of American life such as Nashville, The Long Goodbye and McCabe and Mrs Miller. They were often movies without beginning, end and plotline - cinema's equivalent to freeform jazz. When I ask him what he considers his movies to be about, the best he can come up with is the truth. \"I think artists tend to be fairly truthful. What else is there to deal with but the truth?\" He explains that an artist produces original work, and compares it to journalism. \"If you're working for a mandate like yourself, if you have an assignment to do an interview with a person, you can be artistic about it, but it's difficult to be an artist.\" Altman has always loved pricking our little vanities. Don't worry about hurting my pride, I say to him with a smile. \"Oh, I'm not worried about that,\" he says, with his poker face. We're back with sex. There is a wonderful scene in Short Cuts in which Julianne Moore is arguing with her husband, spills wine on her skirt, yanks it off, and irons in anger. Altman shoots her naked from the waist down for five minutes. We're privy to the most furious, sexless row, and all we can focus on is Moore's flaming pubes. It does strange, ambivalent things to us, which is the intention. I tell him that a friend asked why he's so keen on gratuitous nudity. \"Well that's not a bad question ...\" he says. I feel less stupid. \"But it's also not a good question either.\" Deflated again. Altman talks like the characters in his films - stories overlap, sentences are rarely completed. \"The main idea behind showing nudity is that the minute I show you nudity, I can show you whatever I choose to show you. There is no censorship, nothing preventing me from doing this. Which means I can go further than I have gone, and if I don't it's my choice. Does that make sense to you?\" No, not really, I say. He purrs with impatience. \" We-e-ll, I want you to know that I show whatever I choose. It's my choice, and not made by a censor.\" He says that so much of his achievement is due to the courage of the actors. What is courage in an actor? \"Well I think it's some kind of curse that these people get that they can stand up on a stage and take their clothes off, figuratively or not, and say this is me, these are my eyes, this is my tooth.\" That takes a lot of courage.\" He pulls at a dodgy cavity. \"This is who I am, and they just stand there.\" He says he's never had such courage. In a way, his improvisational technique is a supremely democratic form of film-making. But, of course, there is a dictatorial side - he makes his actors explore all their vulnerabilities till they give him what he wants. And then he makes the final decision. He is one of the very few film-makers who can insist on final cut in his movies. There is a price to pay, though - sometimes, as with his adaptation of John Grisham's The Gingerbread Man, the studio give up on it and fails to give it decent distribution. Altman has never won an Oscar. But then again he has never considered himself a Hollywood insider, a player as he would have it. \"They sell shoes, I make gloves. We're not in the same business,\" he says dismissively. He mentions that he saw Rear Window again recently and that Hitchcock's movie defines so much about film for him. \"The very condition of sitting in a cinema in the dark and watching people behave as if you're not there is very ... it has all the elements of Peeping Tom, all the excitement of that. Rear Window is just a total expression of that human condition.\" He says voyeurism is so much part of daily life, integral to our truth and our fantasies. \"If somebody said to me I wouldn't look in the window across the street if people were having a fight or fucking or naked, or just arguing ...\" He means to say I wouldn't believe them, bust as usual he leaves us to finish the sentence. I say that it's a form of live television for us. He points to OJ Simpson and the Clinton scandal and the Bush-Gore debacle, and grumbles into his chin. He talks about how television has become an alternative reality or an alternative to reality. Perhaps the US election would have made a good Altman movie. \"No, no, no, no ,\" he says. \"It doesn't mean enough, in terms of human relationships, it's too complicated , too big a thing for me to handle.\" He's right. It is both too complex and too simple. Altman has often been called a cynical film-maker. But by showing the myriad ways in which we cheat on ourselves and others, he shows us to be fully human.

      "body": "<p>I have never, to my knowledge, seen an Israeli except on television. I have never spoken to one. I cannot say I have wanted to. My life, like the life of every Egyptian of my generation, has been overcast by the shadow of Israel. I have longed to go to Palestine, but have not wished to go to Israel. And now I am going there.</p> <p>I have not felt such anticipation or such fear since I was a child. For the past two months I have been following the news of the intifada. I have compared the images on the BBC and CNN with those on al-Jazira and other Arab channels. I have unspun stories, fumed at the American newspapers and been grateful for some of the reporting in some of the British press. I have started and ended my days reading appeals for help on the internet. And over and again I have asked myself: \"What is it that I can do?\" Now at last I can do something; I can go see for myself, and write. But going means going there.</p> <p><b> Monday</b></p> <p>It is the first day of Ramadan and we are on the road from Amman to the bridge and I am staring out at the desert and thinking - as I always do - how much I miss it when I'm in England: 10 minutes of rolling dunes, then rock formations rising like huge chocolate gateaux followed by dunes again - but this time rippling as though having a joke, then a bend in the road and a green valley opens up and suddenly a row of bedouin women walking elegantly along a ridge, then sand again and we are at the Jordanian terminal which seems almost empty. We unload and our driver makes inquiries. The West Bank, al-Daffa, is closed. He points to a large, low building and through the windows we see that it is crammed with people. \"But Jerusalem?\" the woman with whom I've shared the taxi asks. Jerusalem, apparently, is open.</p> <p>I know nothing of this woman except that the small daughter on the seat next to her is called Malak - Angel. An orthodox priest in black robes and a grey braid comes out of the room and takes a taxi back to Amman. We go to another part of the terminal. Buses are waiting, loaded with people. Angel's mother decides to go VIP for the sake of the child. I walk along behind her. We hand over our passports and are ushered into a large room with sofas and Arabic newspapers. An exhausted woman comes in. She says she sat in this room yesterday from 2pm till 8pm, then was told Jerusalem was closed and had to go back to Amman. But an official comes in and waves us out.</p> <p>A van this time and when we get off - there it is: \"al-Jisr,\" Umm Angel [Angel's mother] says - the bridge. A wooden construction, just like in the pictures, with wooden walls so you can't jump off and into the Jordan river. We walk across, two women and a red-haired child and there, above our heads, are Israeli soldiers just as I've seen them on television for four decades: their eyes behind shades, their faces behind machine-guns and above them two crossed Israeli flags: one fluttering in the breeze, the other caught in some spike of machinery and lying limp.</p> <p>We stop at a kiosk and hand our passports in through a window to a young woman in army uniform. She waves us on. Another van and on to another terminal building. Had there been Jordanian soldiers and guns on the other side? I didn't see any, but maybe I just didn't notice.</p> <p>We are sitting in a smallish, brightly lit room with vividly blue armchairs. Serious attempts at decor have been made: a cactus growing out of a half coconut shell tilts on an Arab-style carved wooden table, rubber plants and plastic flowers droop from dusty glass shelves, an empty drinks dispenser glows coldly in the corner. On the walls are three reproductions: two are Kandinsky-like, but the third is a large close-up of the two forefingers of God and Adam just failing to meet.</p> <p>A polite young Israeli comes in and asks me in broken Arabic to fill out some forms. Then he comes back to escort us to the passport window. I say: \"I don't want my passport stamped.\" He says: \"I know.\"</p> <p><b> 2.30pm, Jerusalem</b></p> <p>I head out of the hotel and start walking. Every car I pass I imagine exploding into flames. How far away does one have to be not to be killed by an exploding car? But the sun is shining as I head down Salah el-Din Street - and I am at home. The street is lined with bakeries, haberdasheries, shoeshops, small grocers, hairdressers. Girls in school uniform and headscarves walk in groups, chatting, laughing. Boys loiter and watch them. The names on the shops and the doctors' signs are the familiar mix of Muslim and Christian Arab, French and Armenian. The French cultural centre has wide-open doors and an inviting garden; there is a smell of roasting coffee. It's like a smaller, cleaner, uncrowded Cairo. But two buildings look different from the others: they are modern, precise, their angles are sharp, they fly the Israeli flag, and they are the only ones with closed gates that are made of steel bars.</p> <p>But then appearing in front of me are the walls of the Old City. Closer in I see the ancient gateway and beside it an Israeli army car and five soldiers armed with machine-guns. I tie a scarf under my chin and walk past them, through al-Zahra Gate, and I am in a medieval Arab city: Orshalim al-Quds, Jerusalem the Sacred, a city made of rose-hued stone. The streets are paved with it; like cobbles, only larger, the stones are worn smooth and shine in the light. Down steps, round bends and another rosy alley stretches ahead. The houses seem to grow out of the street. Their green iron doors are closed and around many of them are the decorations that proclaim the resident has made the pilgrimage to Makkah. You see these in any Egyptian village but here, instead of the representations of the pilgrim and his/her transport, you get delicate drawings of flowers and birds.</p> <p>A small handwritten sign on the wall points to al-Aqsa. I walk down Mojahedin (Holy Warriors) Street. A small boy, maybe four years old, skips along chanting \"ya Saddam, ya Saddam, come and blow up Tel Abeeb\". A few steps behind him his mother smiles at me. And now I am in front of the gateway to al-Haram al-Sharif (the Noble Sanctuary). Inside the gateway, sitting at a wooden table are three armed soldiers. One stands up and blocks my path: \"Papers.\" I don't like the look of them. I'm one and they are three. My passport is British but it says born in Cairo. Egypt has just recalled its ambassador. But a couple of local men from the administration of the mosque are standing just inside the gateway. I hand over my passport. The soldier flicks through it. \"In England, you live?\" He has a heavy, east European accent.</p> <p>\"Yes.\"</p> <p>I've been told don't explain, don't justify, don't be defensive. Minimal response.</p> <p>\"What town?\"</p> <p>\"London.\"</p> <p>\"Why you are going in?\"</p> <p>I decide: \"To pray.\"</p> <p>\"You are Muslim?\"</p> <p>\"Yes.\"</p> <p>The Israelis have closed the Haram to all Palestinian Muslims, except residents of Jerusalem. And the men have to be above 45. The soldier goes through my bag which I have emptied of everything except purse, tissues and comb. His mates look into the bag, too. He motions me on with his head.</p> <p>A few steps and I am in the vast enclosure of the Haram. Brown earth with shrubs, patches of grass, trees. To my left, the city walls; to my right, the Sanctuary wall is the back of houses and churches, and ahead of me the path rises to meet a wide set of white steps leading to a great stone terrace and out of that rises the golden Dome of the Rock. I sit on a low stone wall under the open sky surrounded by small Mameluke structures and sense utter peace.</p> <p>Later the women come out of prayers. They look at me with open curiosity:</p> <p>\"Salamu aleikum!\"</p> <p>I return the greeting.</p> <p>\"From where, sister?\"</p> <p>\"From Egypt.\"</p> <p>They want to know if I have somewhere to stay, otherwise any one of them will take me home. They all live in the old city, the Dome of the Rock is their local mosque; they nip down every day to pray.</p> <p>Two minutes takes me round a corner, up some stairs and into Umm Yaser's home. Her two young daughters-in-law are both students. They whisper and laugh together over their books.</p> <p>\"She got married three days ago,\" Umm Yasir says, pointing to one of the girls. \"Just over a cup of coffee. Who can have a wedding now when people are being killed every day?\"</p> <p>\"Does the situation affect you here, in the Old City?\"</p> <p>\"Look!\" Umm Yaser says taking me to her door, pointing at the shuttered house across the lane: \"The settlers took it over. They put chairs out here in the lane and pick quarrels with the young people coming and going.\" But how did they take it over?</p> <p>\"Since Ariel Sharon bought two houses here he's made it easy for them.\"</p> <p>But how? Who would sell to Sharon?</p> <p>\"Awwad Abu Sneina. Everybody knew he was a spy. He vanished from the neighbourhood and next thing we knew the Israeli flag went up on the house and Sharon had bought it. But when Abu Sneina died there wasn't a burial ground that would take him. That day my son was playing football and the ball hit one of them [the settlers], they grabbed him and said they'd call the police. We said call the police. But they called some other settlers instead. Two hundred of them came from Atarot Cohunim, hit us with everything they had - even their walkie-talkies. The people praying in the mosque heard the noise and came to our help and it was a battle. The police said we were the aggressors. At the Hadasa hospital they would not treat us under the insurance. They made us pay 450 shekels. Affect us? They do what they like to us.\"</p> <p>She talks of tear gas pumped into houses, of rubber bullets which the Palestinian children peel to extract the steel marble within, which they then aim back at the soldiers with their slingshots. She talks of the threat to her mosque, of an ambulance bringing a 78-year-old neighbour back from hospital, how soldiers searched it and stripped it down to the cooling unit: \"they've grown afraid of the air itself.\" I feel dizzy with the detail piling up in my head and leave before I can be made to stay and eat.</p> <p>Through Bab el-Silsila I see several young Jewish men in black clothes hurrying along and into the tunnel that - I assume - leads to the Wailing Wall. Further along a mild-looking man wearing a yarmulke and leading two children steps out of a building. From within I hear the sound of children chanting in Hebrew. The sun has set and it is time to break my fast.</p> <p>In Bab el-Amoud a man at a stall fills me a pitta bread with falafel, salad and tahina. He finds a chair for me and places a glass of water on the ground at my side. I sit inside the ancient gateway and eat - within sight of the army car and the soldiers and beyond them a beautiful, Indian-looking building standing alone. Two young men lean against a wall discussing what the Arab states can reasonably be expected to do. If only Egypt and Jordan would open the borders, they say, so we're not mice in a trap like this.</p> <p>Back at the hotel I phone a journalist contact. An American I think. I ask a few questions then my enthusiasm for the city bursts forth - and is met with silence.</p> <p>\"What? You don't agree?\"</p> <p>\"Well, yes,\" she says. \"It's just that I think everything would be so much easier if it wasn't there.\"</p> <p>I go out to the grocery next door. I want to buy some yoghurt and dates for my pre-dawn meal. The TV set on the wall is tuned into a Palestinian channel showing the news. Every pot of yoghurt I pick up is labelled in Hebrew only. \"Don't you have any Palestinian yoghurt?\" I ask and the man ushers me to another refrigerator.</p> <p>The news comes through of five workers killed by settlers. A sixth man had managed to get away. The ambulances had raced to the scene but been stopped by the army. Everybody in the shop has stopped in mid-motion and is watching the set. The tears roll down my face as someone's wife wails on the screen but everybody else is impassive. When the item is over they go back to what they were doing.</p> <p>The key to my hotel room will not lock from the inside. From the outside its fine, but not from the inside. I try and try. I feel uneasy about alerting people to the fact that my door does not lock. I decide that I'm safe enough here. I sit down to write today's notes.</p> <p>Soon I will have to try to meet some Israelis.</p> <p><b> Tuesday</b></p> <p>Abraham, Ibrahim al-Khalil, the Friend of God, father of the Arabs through Ismael son of Hager, and of the Jews through Isaac son of Sarah. At midday I am in the city that bears his name and houses his magnificent mosque. We have circuited two roadblocks to get here, turning a journey of half an hour into one of an hour and a half. Our car has Israeli licence plates and so - as we pass the Uruba refugee camp - my driver puts a large sign saying \"Press\" in Arabic against the windscreen to prevent us being pelted with stones. When we pass the giant settlement of Kiryat Araba, my driver turns the Arabic sign over to display the English. \"They came in 1969. They pretended they were a group of Swedish tourists and stayed in a hotel. Their leader was Moshe Levinger. Then they started clashing with the people and they were backed by the military governor, they took the land and built the settlement.\"</p> <p>Think of al-Khalil (or Hebron) as two parts: the old city surrounding the mosque, and the new suburbs that have grown out of it. The main square of the new part is teeming with people. Vegetable and fruit stalls teeter on the edges of pavements and on traffic islands. The Israelis have expropriated the old marketplace and bulldozed it. Raise your eyes from the bustle and you see the evidence of shells and mortars on the building surrounding the square. A gaping hole where the offices of al-Ayyam (the Days) newspaper used to be. Doctor's clinics, toyshops, a hairdresser: rubble, soot, shattered glass and pockmarks. Raise your eyes further and you see the Israeli army sandbagged on people's rooftops, their guns trained on the throng below. \"Twelve tonnes of equipment on my roof,\" a man tells me, \"and they urinate in our water-tanks.\"</p> <p>Al-Shuhada (The Martyrs) Street leads into the old city. It is empty and the shops are shuttered. At its end I see concrete road blocks and as I watch I see a soldier emerge from behind a building beyond the roadblocks, he surveys us, his machine-gun aimed. When he disappears I start walking down the road. My guide pulls me back: \"No. There's already been shooting today.\" The soldier reappears, followed by another. There are maybe 20 metres between us. A young man comes out of a building and says: \"You don't need to be scared of them. Look!\" He runs a few paces towards them, jumps up and down stamps his feet waves his arms and yells out the Arabic equivalent of \"Boo!\" The soldiers duck behind the wall. \"See! They're cowards!\" he laughs and saunters off.</p> <p>As we stand talking a tall man appears carrying a camera and wearing a white helmet and a white bullet-proof vest with \"Press\" written in black across it. Awad Awad works for Agence France Presse. He stops to talk and my guide tells him I'm writing an article for the Guardian. \"You want to go in?\" he asks.</p> <p>I follow him through the roadblock and round the corner. Now I can see the soldiers grouped behind the wall at the end of al-Shuhada Street. Behind a building at the other side of the street are a journalist and three more photographers. We walk past the soldiers, then Awad says \"Run!\" and we run across the street and join the posse of cameras on the other side. We introduce ourselves and shake hands. \"What are they doing?\" a man asks nodding towards the seven soldiers huddled behind the wall. \"Making a plan,\" another laughs.</p> <p>The soldiers break up and three of them run across the road towards us. They crouch behind the concrete blocks, their guns aimed at the empty street. If I stretch out my hand I can touch their backpacks. After a moment a stone crashes into one of the concrete blocks and splinters off. A boy dances across the street. A shot is fired. It is alarmingly loud. The same event is repeated six times in the next half hour. Twice, in the silence following a shot a woman walks quickly across the street. Three people in blue dungarees and helmets with IPIF written in red across their bullet-proof vests [international observers] stand across the road. I cannot make out if they are men or women. They carry clip-boards and timers and seem to be recording the times of the shots. The photographers tell me that when there is going to be any real action the soldiers simply shoo away the IPIF people. A mobile rings and it is my guide begging me to come back.</p> <p>I want to go into the old city but my guide and driver are fearful and reluctant. As we argue in the street an imposing man in a grey cashmere overcoat appears. They seem awed by him. I later learn that he is a Palestinian journalist who has been shot in five separate incidents. He says \"Come on chaps. It's your duty to take her in. You've got Israeli licence plates. She's got a British passport. Take her in.\"</p> <p>Reluctantly they make a detour and try to drive into the old city. Forty thousand people live here under curfew. 12,000 children cannot go to school. Fifteen mosques are closed. In the centre, armed, live what Israel says are 400 settlers and the Palestinians say are 100. All this is for their benefit.</p> <p>\"If the army were to go away,\" I ask, \"and the settlers were content to live here among you, would you let them?\"</p> <p>\"They would go away.\"</p> <p>\"But if they wanted to stay, could they?\"</p> <p>\"But they've taken people's homes. If you could go into the centre you would see families camped by their homes, refusing to leave, and the settlers throw rubbish on them and beat them up. They're not even proper settlers; they are religious students, mostly from the US, volunteering to come for one or two years to do their religious duty by being here.\"</p> <p>The city is beautiful. Like old Jerusalem it is made of pink stone. The narrow streets wind up and down like the streets of an Etruscan town. The houses lean against each other, one house's roof forming the other's patio. Ornate stone balconies look out on to the empty street. The sun shines, the air is clean and fresh, the light is so perfect we could be on a film set. A dark green patrol car passes and does not stop us. The microphone blares out in accented Arabic: \"O people of al-Khalil. Beware breaking the curfew.\" Round the next bend a yellow taxi is at a stop in the middle of the road, leaning to one side. A group of children has gathered round it watching, hushed and still. We pull in by a wall and park. A woman leans against the taxi with a baby in her arms. \"I know it's a curfew,\" the driver says, \"but she has just come out of hospital, and she had the baby, so I drove her. Look what they've done.\" A soldier had taken out a knife and slashed the two tyres on the driver's side. Naturally he only has one spare tyre. With the curfew how is he going to get another one? Two boys are helping him change one wheel. The other children look on in silence. The woman starts walking off slowly.</p> <p>We carry on, on foot. Up some steps leading down to the centre an old man is climbing. \"Can we get to the centre?\"</p> <p>\"No. They've blocked it off.\"</p> <p>\"Is there somewhere from where I can at least see the centre and the mosque?\"</p> <p>\"Yes, from my house,\" and he turns back to lead the way.</p> <p>Through a green iron door I step into paradise. Terrace after terrace of pink stone, green plants and flowers growing out of tin cans, trellises with vines, doorways that the old man opens with big keys and that lead into vaulted chambers where ancient Sufis meditated and prayed to be vouchsafed a vision. Some of the chambers have Mameluke niches where I imagine the Sufis kept their jars of water and bundles of dates. I emerge from a chamber to find myself looking at a wall with wire-mesh windows and above them the Israeli flag. \"Yes. They are here,\" he says. They are looking at us and we keep our eyes averted. \"They occupied the building next door and they tried to get me out of this. I said I would bring out my sword and kill the first man to step over my threshold.\"</p> <p>\"What happened?\"</p> <p>\"They put iron doors on the street openings between my house and the mosque - and they set up this surveillance camera up there.\"</p> <p>\"And now they leave you alone?\" as I take a photo of the camera.</p> <p>\"I have no children now or young men to make trouble. There is just me and my wife. The (Palestinian) authority came and said: Give us the biggest vault. We'll make it into a museum.'\"And?</p> <p>\"I threatened them too with my sword. They would have turned it over to the Israelis.\"</p> <p>An old woman appears on a balcony and calls to him to bring the guests into the house. On the patio outside the house two very old Singer sewing machines sit side by side. \"I just oiled them yesterday,\" he spins the wheel to prove that they work beautifully.</p> <p>In the living-room there is another sewing-machine. \"But this one can do embroidery,\" he says, and pulls out a rag to show us the different stitches. \"I don't know what he wants with all these old machines,\" his wife says. On the wall there are the three young men. On each there is written a name prefaced by \"The Martyr\".</p> <p>\"My nephews,\" the old woman says. Come, you can see the mosque from the kitchen window.\" I see the rose-pink walls of Ibrahim's Sanctuary and beyond them, in the central town square, the army camp with the sandbags, the guns, the soldiers and the white flag with blue star. My guide tells me that Saturday is the worst day here because the settlers have more time to walk around upturning vegetable stalls and kicking people. The army protects them, he says. My driver loses patience: \"We've gone down the road of 'peace' as we were asked to. Meetings and summits without end. And what's the result? Is this right? That a wronged population should be punished? In 94 Baruch Goldstein murders the worshippers and this is what we get? The mosque is divided and now with the curfew this old man who has prayed in it every day of his life cannot set foot in it?\"</p> <p>\"The unjust will be visited with retribution,\" the old man says gently, \"and I pray on my terrace within sight of the Sanctuary walls.\"</p> <p>I think of the decisive battle, in 1517, when Mameluke Egypt fell to the Ottoman Turks. When the dashing Mameluke knights, until then the finest fighting force in the world, rode out to do battle, they found themselves with the modern technology of Ottoman guns in front of them and treachery at their backs.</p> <p>Back on the road the taxi is still there. We drive out of al-Khalil, negotiate roadblocks and go on to the motorway. Ahead of us is an army truck. He drives slowly and we are not allowed to pass him. In the back three young soldiers watch us. It is getting near to sunset and breaking the fast. A roadblock near Bethlehem and we are pulled over. My driver opens his window and hands over his papers. I stare ahead but suddenly my door is flung open. A rather plump young soldier bends down, smiling:</p> <p>\"What did they thay today? The Tanthim? That they would thtop the shooting?\"</p> <p>Somehow the lisp reassures me.</p> <p>\"Who?\" I ask.</p> <p>\"The Tanthim.\"</p> <p>When I look blankly at him he says: \"Fatah. What did they thay today?\"</p> <p>\"I'm frightfully sorry,\" I say, speaking posh. \"I don't know. I've been out all day and haven't seen the news.\"</p> <p>\"But you have a radio in the car?\"</p> <p>My driver leans over and speaks in Hebrew: \"What would she know? Can't you see she's foreign?\"</p> <p>They wave us on. My driver is convinced the soldier's questions were a trap. \"Son of a bitch,\" he laughs, \"they don't miss a trick.\"</p> <p>Maybe there are cafes in West Jerusalem or Tel Aviv where intellectuals, artists, people, sit around and debate the condition of the country and the \"Palestinian problem\". Maybe they debate the ethics of an army of occupation holding a population hostage, or the civil rights of an Arab population in a zionist state, but these places - the places that are lit up at night - how do I find them? In the entertainment guide I look at the listings: films, recitals, cabarets. I consider taking a taxi and simply buying a ticket. But even the thought makes me uneasy.</p> <p><b>To continue</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/departments/politicsphilosophyandsociety/story/0,6000,413358,00.html\">Under the gun (continued)</a></p>",

Had there been Jordanian soldiers and guns on the other side? I didn't see any, but maybe I just didn't notice. We are sitting in a smallish, brightly lit room with vividly blue armchairs. Serious attempts at decor have been made: a cactus growing out of a half coconut shell tilts on an Arab-style carved wooden table, rubber plants and plastic flowers droop from dusty glass shelves, an empty drinks dispenser glows coldly in the corner. On the walls are three reproductions: two are Kandinsky-like, but the third is a large close-up of the two forefingers of God and Adam just failing to meet. A polite young Israeli comes in and asks me in broken Arabic to fill out some forms. Then he comes back to escort us to the passport window. I say: \"I don't want my passport stamped.\" He says: \"I know.\" 2.30pm, Jerusalem I head out of the hotel and start walking. Every car I pass I imagine exploding into flames.

The street is lined with bakeries, haberdasheries, shoeshops, small grocers, hairdressers. Girls in school uniform and headscarves walk in groups, chatting, laughing. Boys loiter and watch them.

But then appearing in front of me are the walls of the Old City. Closer in I see the ancient gateway and beside it an Israeli army car and five soldiers armed with machine-guns. I tie a scarf under my chin and walk past them, through al-Zahra Gate, and I am in a medieval Arab city: Orshalim al-Quds, Jerusalem the Sacred, a city made of rose-hued stone. The streets are paved with it; like cobbles, only larger, the stones are worn smooth and shine in the light. Down steps, round bends and another rosy alley stretches ahead. The houses seem to grow out of the street. Their green iron doors are closed and around many of them are the decorations that proclaim the resident has made the pilgrimage to Makkah. You see these in any Egyptian village but here, instead of the representations of the pilgrim and his/her transport, you get delicate drawings of flowers and birds. A small handwritten sign on the wall points to al-Aqsa. I walk down Mojahedin (Holy Warriors) Street. A small boy, maybe four years old, skips along chanting \"ya Saddam, ya Saddam, come and blow up Tel Abeeb\". A few steps behind him his mother smiles at me. And now I am in front of the gateway to al-Haram al-Sharif (the Noble Sanctuary). Inside the gateway, sitting at a wooden table are three armed soldiers. One stands up and blocks my path: \"Papers.\" I don't like the look of them. I'm one and they are three. My passport is British but it says born in Cairo. Egypt has just recalled its ambassador. But a couple of local men from the administration of the mosque are standing just inside the gateway. I hand over my passport. The soldier flicks through it. \"In England, you live?\" He has a heavy, east European accent. \"Yes.\" I've been told don't explain, don't justify, don't be defensive. Minimal response. \"What town?\" \"London.\" \"Why you are going in?\" I decide: \"To pray.\" \"You are Muslim?\" \"Yes.\" The Israelis have closed the Haram to all Palestinian Muslims, except residents of Jerusalem. And the men have to be above 45. The soldier goes through my bag which I have emptied of everything except purse, tissues and comb. His mates look into the bag, too. He motions me on with his head. A few steps and I am in the vast enclosure of the Haram. Brown earth with shrubs, patches of grass, trees. To my left, the city walls; to my right, the Sanctuary wall is the back of houses and churches, and ahead of me the path rises to meet a wide set of white steps leading to a great stone terrace and out of that rises the golden Dome of the Rock. I sit on a low stone wall under the open sky surrounded by small Mameluke structures and sense utter peace. Later the women come out of prayers. They look at me with open curiosity: \"Salamu aleikum!\" I return the greeting. \"From where, sister?\" \"From Egypt.\" They want to know if I have somewhere to stay, otherwise any one of them will take me home. They all live in the old city, the Dome of the Rock is their local mosque; they nip down every day to pray. Two minutes takes me round a corner, up some stairs and into Umm Yaser's home. Her two young daughters-in-law are both students. They whisper and laugh together over their books. \"She got married three days ago,\" Umm Yasir says, pointing to one of the girls. \"Just over a cup of coffee. Who can have a wedding now when people are being killed every day?\" \"Does the situation affect you here, in the Old City?\" \"Look!\" Umm Yaser says taking me to her door, pointing at the shuttered house across the lane: \"The settlers took it over. They put chairs out here in the lane and pick quarrels with the young people coming and going.\" But how did they take it over? \"Since Ariel Sharon bought two houses here he's made it easy for them.\" But how? Who would sell to Sharon? \"Awwad Abu Sneina. Everybody knew he was a spy. He vanished from the neighbourhood and next thing we knew the Israeli flag went up on the house and Sharon had bought it. But when Abu Sneina died there wasn't a burial ground that would take him. That day my son was playing football and the ball hit one of them [the settlers], they grabbed him and said they'd call the police. We said call the police. But they called some other settlers instead. Two hundred of them came from Atarot Cohunim, hit us with everything they had - even their walkie-talkies. The people praying in the mosque heard the noise and came to our help and it was a battle. The police said we were the aggressors. At the Hadasa hospital they would not treat us under the insurance. They made us pay 450 shekels. Affect us? They do what they like to us.\" She talks of tear gas pumped into houses, of rubber bullets which the Palestinian children peel to extract the steel marble within, which they then aim back at the soldiers with their slingshots. She talks of the threat to her mosque, of an ambulance bringing a 78-year-old neighbour back from hospital, how soldiers searched it and stripped it down to the cooling unit: \"they've grown afraid of the air itself.\" I feel dizzy with the detail piling up in my head and leave before I can be made to stay and eat. Through Bab el-Silsila I see several young Jewish men in black clothes hurrying along and into the tunnel that - I assume - leads to the Wailing Wall. Further along a mild-looking man wearing a yarmulke and leading two children steps out of a building. From within I hear the sound of children chanting in Hebrew. The sun has set and it is time to break my fast. In Bab el-Amoud a man at a stall fills me a pitta bread with falafel, salad and tahina. He finds a chair for me and places a glass of water on the ground at my side. I sit inside the ancient gateway and eat - within sight of the army car and the soldiers and beyond them a beautiful, Indian-looking building standing alone. Two young men lean against a wall discussing what the Arab states can reasonably be expected to do. If only Egypt and Jordan would open the borders, they say, so we're not mice in a trap like this. Back at the hotel I phone a journalist contact. An American I think. I ask a few questions then my enthusiasm for the city bursts forth - and is met with silence. \"What? You don't agree?\" \"Well, yes,\" she says. \"It's just that I think everything would be so much easier if it wasn't there.\" I go out to the grocery next door. I want to buy some yoghurt and dates for my pre-dawn meal. The TV set on the wall is tuned into a Palestinian channel showing the news. Every pot of yoghurt I pick up is labelled in Hebrew only. \"Don't you have any Palestinian yoghurt?\" I ask and the man ushers me to another refrigerator. The news comes through of five workers killed by settlers. A sixth man had managed to get away. The ambulances had raced to the scene but been stopped by the army. Everybody in the shop has stopped in mid-motion and is watching the set. The tears roll down my face as someone's wife wails on the screen but everybody else is impassive. When the item is over they go back to what they were doing. The key to my hotel room will not lock from the inside. From the outside its fine, but not from the inside. I try and try. I feel uneasy about alerting people to the fact that my door does not lock. I decide that I'm safe enough here. I sit down to write today's notes. Soon I will have to try to meet some Israelis. Tuesday Abraham, Ibrahim al-Khalil, the Friend of God, father of the Arabs through Ismael son of Hager, and of the Jews through Isaac son of Sarah. At midday I am in the city that bears his name and houses his magnificent mosque. We have circuited two roadblocks to get here, turning a journey of half an hour into one of an hour and a half. Our car has Israeli licence plates and so - as we pass the Uruba refugee camp - my driver puts a large sign saying \"Press\" in Arabic against the windscreen to prevent us being pelted with stones. When we pass the giant settlement of Kiryat Araba, my driver turns the Arabic sign over to display the English. \"They came in 1969. They pretended they were a group of Swedish tourists and stayed in a hotel. Their leader was Moshe Levinger. Then they started clashing with the people and they were backed by the military governor, they took the land and built the settlement.\" Think of al-Khalil (or Hebron) as two parts: the old city surrounding the mosque, and the new suburbs that have grown out of it. The main square of the new part is teeming with people. Vegetable and fruit stalls teeter on the edges of pavements and on traffic islands. The Israelis have expropriated the old marketplace and bulldozed it. Raise your eyes from the bustle and you see the evidence of shells and mortars on the building surrounding the square. A gaping hole where the offices of al-Ayyam (the Days) newspaper used to be. Doctor's clinics, toyshops, a hairdresser: rubble, soot, shattered glass and pockmarks. Raise your eyes further and you see the Israeli army sandbagged on people's rooftops, their guns trained on the throng below. \"Twelve tonnes of equipment on my roof,\" a man tells me, \"and they urinate in our water-tanks.\" Al-Shuhada (The Martyrs) Street leads into the old city. It is empty and the shops are shuttered. At its end I see concrete road blocks and as I watch I see a soldier emerge from behind a building beyond the roadblocks, he surveys us, his machine-gun aimed. When he disappears I start walking down the road. My guide pulls me back: \"No. There's already been shooting today.\" The soldier reappears, followed by another. There are maybe 20 metres between us. A young man comes out of a building and says: \"You don't need to be scared of them. Look!\" He runs a few paces towards them, jumps up and down stamps his feet waves his arms and yells out the Arabic equivalent of \"Boo!\" The soldiers duck behind the wall. \"See! They're cowards!\" he laughs and saunters off. As we stand talking a tall man appears carrying a camera and wearing a white helmet and a white bullet-proof vest with \"Press\" written in black across it. Awad Awad works for Agence France Presse. He stops to talk and my guide tells him I'm writing an article for the Guardian. \"You want to go in?\" he asks. I follow him through the roadblock and round the corner. Now I can see the soldiers grouped behind the wall at the end of al-Shuhada Street. Behind a building at the other side of the street are a journalist and three more photographers. We walk past the soldiers, then Awad says \"Run!\" and we run across the street and join the posse of cameras on the other side. We introduce ourselves and shake hands. \"What are they doing?\" a man asks nodding towards the seven soldiers huddled behind the wall. \"Making a plan,\" another laughs. The soldiers break up and three of them run across the road towards us. They crouch behind the concrete blocks, their guns aimed at the empty street. If I stretch out my hand I can touch their backpacks. After a moment a stone crashes into one of the concrete blocks and splinters off. A boy dances across the street. A shot is fired. It is alarmingly loud. The same event is repeated six times in the next half hour. Twice, in the silence following a shot a woman walks quickly across the street. Three people in blue dungarees and helmets with IPIF written in red across their bullet-proof vests [international observers] stand across the road. I cannot make out if they are men or women. They carry clip-boards and timers and seem to be recording the times of the shots. The photographers tell me that when there is going to be any real action the soldiers simply shoo away the IPIF people. A mobile rings and it is my guide begging me to come back. I want to go into the old city but my guide and driver are fearful and reluctant. As we argue in the street an imposing man in a grey cashmere overcoat appears. They seem awed by him. I later learn that he is a Palestinian journalist who has been shot in five separate incidents. He says \"Come on chaps. It's your duty to take her in. You've got Israeli licence plates. She's got a British passport. Take her in.\" Reluctantly they make a detour and try to drive into the old city. Forty thousand people live here under curfew. 12,000 children cannot go to school. Fifteen mosques are closed. In the centre, armed, live what Israel says are 400 settlers and the Palestinians say are 100. All this is for their benefit. \"If the army were to go away,\" I ask, \"and the settlers were content to live here among you, would you let them?\" \"They would go away.\" \"But if they wanted to stay, could they?\" \"But they've taken people's homes. If you could go into the centre you would see families camped by their homes, refusing to leave, and the settlers throw rubbish on them and beat them up. They're not even proper settlers; they are religious students, mostly from the US, volunteering to come for one or two years to do their religious duty by being here.\" The city is beautiful. Like old Jerusalem it is made of pink stone. The narrow streets wind up and down like the streets of an Etruscan town. The houses lean against each other, one house's roof forming the other's patio. Ornate stone balconies look out on to the empty street. The sun shines, the air is clean and fresh, the light is so perfect we could be on a film set. A dark green patrol car passes and does not stop us. The microphone blares out in accented Arabic: \"O people of al-Khalil. Beware breaking the curfew.\" Round the next bend a yellow taxi is at a stop in the middle of the road, leaning to one side. A group of children has gathered round it watching, hushed and still. We pull in by a wall and park. A woman leans against the taxi with a baby in her arms. \"I know it's a curfew,\" the driver says, \"but she has just come out of hospital, and she had the baby, so I drove her. Look what they've done.\" A soldier had taken out a knife and slashed the two tyres on the driver's side. Naturally he only has one spare tyre. With the curfew how is he going to get another one? Two boys are helping him change one wheel. The other children look on in silence. The woman starts walking off slowly. We carry on, on foot. Up some steps leading down to the centre an old man is climbing. \"Can we get to the centre?\" \"No. They've blocked it off.\" \"Is there somewhere from where I can at least see the centre and the mosque?\" \"Yes, from my house,\" and he turns back to lead the way. Through a green iron door I step into paradise. Terrace after terrace of pink stone, green plants and flowers growing out of tin cans, trellises with vines, doorways that the old man opens with big keys and that lead into vaulted chambers where ancient Sufis meditated and prayed to be vouchsafed a vision. Some of the chambers have Mameluke niches where I imagine the Sufis kept their jars of water and bundles of dates. I emerge from a chamber to find myself looking at a wall with wire-mesh windows and above them the Israeli flag. \"Yes. They are here,\" he says. They are looking at us and we keep our eyes averted. \"They occupied the building next door and they tried to get me out of this. I said I would bring out my sword and kill the first man to step over my threshold.\" \"What happened?\" \"They put iron doors on the street openings between my house and the mosque - and they set up this surveillance camera up there.\" \"And now they leave you alone?\" as I take a photo of the camera. \"I have no children now or young men to make trouble. There is just me and my wife. The (Palestinian) authority came and said: Give us the biggest vault. We'll make it into a museum.'\"And? \"I threatened them too with my sword. They would have turned it over to the Israelis.\" An old woman appears on a balcony and calls to him to bring the guests into the house. On the patio outside the house two very old Singer sewing machines sit side by side. \"I just oiled them yesterday,\" he spins the wheel to prove that they work beautifully. In the living-room there is another sewing-machine. \"But this one can do embroidery,\" he says, and pulls out a rag to show us the different stitches. \"I don't know what he wants with all these old machines,\" his wife says. On the wall there are the three young men. On each there is written a name prefaced by \"The Martyr\". \"My nephews,\" the old woman says. Come, you can see the mosque from the kitchen window.\" I see the rose-pink walls of Ibrahim's Sanctuary and beyond them, in the central town square, the army camp with the sandbags, the guns, the soldiers and the white flag with blue star. My guide tells me that Saturday is the worst day here because the settlers have more time to walk around upturning vegetable stalls and kicking people. The army protects them, he says. My driver loses patience: \"We've gone down the road of 'peace' as we were asked to. Meetings and summits without end. And what's the result? Is this right? That a wronged population should be punished? In 94 Baruch Goldstein murders the worshippers and this is what we get? The mosque is divided and now with the curfew this old man who has prayed in it every day of his life cannot set foot in it?\" \"The unjust will be visited with retribution,\" the old man says gently, \"and I pray on my terrace within sight of the Sanctuary walls.\" I think of the decisive battle, in 1517, when Mameluke Egypt fell to the Ottoman Turks. When the dashing Mameluke knights, until then the finest fighting force in the world, rode out to do battle, they found themselves with the modern technology of Ottoman guns in front of them and treachery at their backs. Back on the road the taxi is still there. We drive out of al-Khalil, negotiate roadblocks and go on to the motorway. Ahead of us is an army truck. He drives slowly and we are not allowed to pass him. In the back three young soldiers watch us. It is getting near to sunset and breaking the fast. A roadblock near Bethlehem and we are pulled over. My driver opens his window and hands over his papers. I stare ahead but suddenly my door is flung open. A rather plump young soldier bends down, smiling: \"What did they thay today? The Tanthim? That they would thtop the shooting?\" Somehow the lisp reassures me. \"Who?\" I ask. \"The Tanthim.\" When I look blankly at him he says: \"Fatah. What did they thay today?\" \"I'm frightfully sorry,\" I say, speaking posh. \"I don't know. I've been out all day and haven't seen the news.\" \"But you have a radio in the car?\" My driver leans over and speaks in Hebrew: \"What would she know? Can't you see she's foreign?\" They wave us on. My driver is convinced the soldier's questions were a trap. \"Son of a bitch,\" he laughs, \"they don't miss a trick.\" Maybe there are cafes in West Jerusalem or Tel Aviv where intellectuals, artists, people, sit around and debate the condition of the country and the \"Palestinian problem\". Maybe they debate the ethics of an army of occupation holding a population hostage, or the civil rights of an Arab population in a zionist state, but these places - the places that are lit up at night - how do I find them? In the entertainment guide I look at the listings: films, recitals, cabarets. I consider taking a taxi and simply buying a ticket. But even the thought makes me uneasy. To continue Under the gun (continued)",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Guardian Unlimited asked Guardian film critics Peter Bradshaw, Derek Malcolm and Jonathan Romney to discuss the highs and lows of the past year in film with journalist, producer and broadcaster Tracey MacLeod. You can listen to the entire broadcast on Friday December 22 (details at the <a href=\"#details\">bottom of the page</a>), in the meantime, read the transcript below.</p> <p><strong>TM:</strong> With me to discuss the biggest films and the key developments of 2000 are the Guardian film critic, <strong>Peter Bradshaw</strong>, who combines his reviewing activities with writing the Tad Friendly column in London's Evening Standard and is about to make his own screen debut as co-writer and performer in David Baddiel's new sitcom. <strong>Derek Malcolm</strong>, who served as the Guardian's film critic for three decades. He's just put the finishing touches to his selection of his one hundred favourite films of the 20th century, and at Cannes was presented with a medal for his services to cinema by the president, Gilles Jacob. As well as being an arts columnist for the Guardian, <strong>Jonathan Romney</strong> is film critic for the New Statesman.</p> <p>Let's start by remembering what's always the high-point of the film year - the Oscars. This year saw a sweet triumph for emerging British talent when American Beauty, a Hollywood film helmed by London theatre director Sam Mendes, scooped the trophies for best picture, director and actor for its star, Kevin Spacey. The British recipient for the Best Supporting Actor was Michael Caine for his performance in an American movie, The Cider House Rules. Sir Michael - or should that be Sir Maurice? - used a subsequent Bafta ceremony to berate what he saw as English snobbery in the film industry. </p> <p>More controversy surrounded the year's big summer blockbuster, The Patriot, set during the American War of Independence. Mel Gibson played an heroic plantation owner battling against genocidal English soldiers and, unsurprisingly, the film was largely shunned in British cinemas. Here, summer audiences seemed more attracted to the less partisan charms of X-Men, which at least balanced its English-accented villain, Ian McKellen, with an English-accented hero, Patrick Stewart.</p> <p><strong>AMERICAN BEAUTY</strong></p> <p>But lets go back to the film that swept the board on Oscar night. A tart tale of one man's mid-life crisis, <strong>American Beauty</strong> opened in January to rave reviews and strong box-office and looks set to finish the year on most British top 10 lists.</p> <p>Peter, American Beauty was that rare thing, a critical success that also captured the public's imagination. Is it going to finish the year on your top 10 list?</p> <p><strong>PB:</strong> I'm not sure. When I first saw it I was very much taken with it, I thought it was terrific, very well acted and Sam Mendes had assembled a beautifully modulated cast, all giving first-rate performances. But I think it was over-praised and we all became rather over-excited about it. It's a bit like candyfloss, it kind of reduces in the mouth and you think, well what was the fuss about, frankly? I think it was a very good film and it was very intelligently directed. I'm not sure how far we should claim it as a British success, although Sam Mendes is obviously British, it was more of a success for the mighty Dreamworks studio in steamrollering us all into thinking that this was a very classy film. But it is a good film, but a little over praised.</p> <p><strong>DM:</strong> I agree totally. I can't understand exactly why it was so successful, all I can say is it's Magnolia lite. Magnolia was a much more original and audacious film. American Beauty was very well made, and certainly Sam Mendes is a very fine director and he put it together extremely well, but at the end of it I don't think it says anything original about America at all.</p> <p><strong>TM:</strong> Jonathan, it entered some dark and dangerous territory in its hero's obsession with an underage girl. Was it refreshing that a film that dealt with dangerous subjects did so well at the Oscars?</p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> Well, it's only refreshing if it starts dangerous and stays dangerous. I thought it was a very glib, light film. Very glib treatment of the sort of things that people like David Lynch have taken on before. The whole idea of suburbia and mid-life crisis was done superbly in Ang Lee's film, The Ice Storm, American Beauty didn't come near it. I thought also <strong>Wonderboys</strong> - completely underrated - a Michael Douglas film by Curtis Hanson, did the mid-life crisis with much more intelligence and wry wit. There's also a problem in American Beauty in that Kevin Spacey's performance has become the great stereotype of his age, he's found his riff just in the way Jack Nicholson has. And after seeing this film I think I've seen all of Kevin Spacey that I want to see for a long while.</p> <p><strong>PB:</strong> I think Jonathan's right, the thing about it being somehow dangerous that he's obsessed with these young women. That not dangerous at all. What would have been dangerous would have been for him to actually have sex with Mena Suvari. That would have been really dangerous. But the whole Hollywood Puritanism came crashing down at the end of that film, and no sexual denouement was going to be allowed. Instead there was a very false, violent denouement that was conjured up out of nowhere. As to Kevin Spacey's performance, it is terrific, but Jonathan's right in that Kevin Spacey is capable of giving very disappointing performances, for example in <strong>Ordinary, Decent Criminals</strong>, an Irish film which was appalling, and he was clearly on that same note, but not very well directed or written.</p> <p><strong>TM:</strong> Obviously he and Sam Mendes developed a very good working relationship. Is this going to be a hard act to follow for Mendes?</p> <p><strong>DM:</strong> I don't think it will be a hard act, he's a sensible guy and I don't think that he's going to try and make some huge Hollywood film straight afterwards. In fact I think he'd rather make a small film after this. I think he'll continue to make good films, even better films. They may not be so successful...</p> <p><strong>MAGNOLIA and BEING JOHN MALKOVICH</strong></p> <p><strong>TM:</strong> Two other films that narrowly missed out on big Oscar wins, but were nonetheless huge critical successes are Paul Thomas Anderson's sprawling Los Angeles mosaic, <strong>Magnolia</strong>, and the willfully iconoclastic <strong>Being John Malkovich</strong>, in which John Cusack's lonely puppeteer discovers a portal that leads him inside the head of the famous movie actor. Derek Malcolm, you're a huge fan of Magnolia, does this stake Anderson's claim as being a great movie director?</p> <p><strong>DM:</strong> I don't know about a great director, but he's certainly a very good and original one. I loathe long films, but I sat through that even though it was too long. It tells you everything that American Beauty doesn't tell you about American society in a much bolder way. What I like about the film is that he actually lets people act, he doesn't cut scenes in a convenient Hollywood way at all. That's why the film's so long, I suppose. Every bit of the film had wonderful moments in it, but it could have been cut by 45 minutes and still been a wonderful film. But I'm glad it wasn't because there are moments all the time which are simply not the moments Hollywood gives us.</p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> I agree. I think Paul Thomas Anderson is absolutely brilliant. I think he's got more energy as a storyteller, as someone who's inventing visual ideas, as someone who's inventing tricks, as someone who's trying to engage the audience, than anyone else in Hollywood at the moment. People are comparing him now to Robert Altman in the 70s. I think he wants to be the Californian Balzac - he wants to take the whole of Californian society and cram it in as much as he can. This film goes all over the place. It's definitely what you would call a 'flawed masterpiece', I think a flaw can make a masterpiece, it's nearly a masterpiece. It's the flaws - too much energy in one place, too many ideas to cram in, I was really tired of the film after two hours and I thought 'enough', but suddenly he turns it round with this boost of energy. It's got the weirdest and most spectacular last-minute twist, the most apocalyptic of any film I've seen in years. </p> <p><strong>PB:</strong> Yes. I thought it was an incredibly exciting film, very rarely do I feel excited by the prospect of a film and almost continually excited all the way through it. I think he's a very good director of certain types of actors, his repertory player, Philip Baker Hall, seems to turn up in nearly every American film because of his addled old face, to give some character-actor class, Paul Thomas Anderson used him brilliantly. Also Tom Cruise, who is routinely reviled as being the worst thing in the world, was very very good in this.</p> <p><strong>TM:</strong> It's an ensemble film in the tradition of Robert Altman, and this presents different problems for a director. Do you think it is easier to create a great portmanteau film than one with a linear story?</p> <p><strong>PB:</strong> I'm not sure. Portmanteau films can go all to pieces, and this almost went all to pieces, but in an interesting way. Also, as well as its sprawlingness it's also the loudest film I've ever been to. Especially at the beginning when the soundtrack is turned up to ear-splitting levels, and over the dialogue as well. I didn't have a problem with this - I thought it was great.</p> <p><strong>TM:</strong> Do you think film critics sometimes have a different perception of films than your average film-goer because they have to see films in the morning?</p> <p><strong>PB:</strong> I've seen it in the morning and I've seen it in the evening, and every time I've liked it. I think sometimes critics like this sort of film more than the public. We are so used to rubbish and boring nonsense with dull and derivative narratives, that when something new, that doesn't rely so heavily on conventional narrative is presented to us, we get very overexcited. Though it's justified in this case.</p> <p><strong>TM:</strong> <strong>Memento</strong> would be a case in point, it's been critically praised but I found myself quite turned off by the narrative device, the plot running backwards. But if you see five or 10 films a week, I would imagine that it would appeal more.</p> <p><strong>PB:</strong> Well, that's true. Memento, like Magnolia, is not a Friday-night movie. It's still a great film.</p> <p><strong>TM:</strong> Moving on to <strong>Being John Malkovich</strong>. It introduced us to this imaginative world, full of possibilities. I was disappointed that it didn't prove to be a portal into a more interesting place.</p> <p><strong>DM:</strong> I saw it at the Venice festival, and everyone came out saying, 'That was an interesting film', and it was only after that that everybody seemed to say it was much more than that. I think the last reel isn't anything like as good as the rest of the film, but up to that point I thought it was about the most original American film I'd seen for a very long time. It does all sorts of things that are not done by Hollywood at all, and it does them pretty well, but the last reel suggests that there's not much more to say.</p> <p><strong>TM:</strong> Jonathan, was it one of your films of the year?</p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> Yes, definitely. I think again it's this idea of a film being flawed that tells you that the film-makers are trying to do something extra that might not quite come off. I agree that the energy may have flagged, but you start off with a high-concept idea - imagine if you could go into the head of John Malkovich and be him for a moment. Then you ask, why John Malkovich? and then you realise that's just part of a whole heap of ideas which aren't fully developed and they don't gel. But there's some really extraordinary stuff. People keep saying that British cinema needs to keep up with America, but the interesting American films - Fight Club, Being John Malkovich, Magnolia - are so far removed from anything we can do here. The rules are being reinvented.</p> <p><strong>TM:</strong> I wonder if we could be seeing a period where the maverick auteur director comes into his own in the same way that Scorsese and Coppola did in the 1970s? </p> <p><strong>PB:</strong> That's what you hope, and we hoped that up to and including Oscar night this year when they all disappeared. I haven't got that excited about these people since then, and the paucity of the material available for the next Oscars seems to bear that out. I'd like to agree with Jonathan, except about Fight Club...</p> <p><strong>DM:</strong> I think it is true, but those films don't actually make very much money, so I don't think Hollywood will continue to back them. Hollywood backs money and these people are unlikely to be making blockbusters. So for us this is a new wave of film-making which is extremely valuable, but for the general public, maybe not.</p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> I think the problem is that I don't see anyone who's going to have a great run of movies like Altman or Scorsese. Maybe Paul Thomas Anderson or Spike Jonze will have one or two great shots, but my theory is that after that they will be institutionalised very fast. This happened with Brian Singer, who made Usual Suspects, but then signed up and made X-Men, which is shiny and nothing.</p> <p><strong>DANCER IN THE DARK</strong></p> <p><strong>TM:</strong> Let's talk about European maverick Lars Von Trier. The most important date in the European film calendar is Cannes, and this year it whipped up its own controversy when it awarded best film to Von Trier's <strong>Dancer in the Dark</strong>. A sort of kitchen-sink-death-row-musical, Dancer in the Dark divided its audience - either you loved it or you hated it. Peter, you called it 'sensationally silly, shallow, crudely manipulative'.</p> <p><strong>PB:</strong> It's not my worst film of the year (that goes to Rules of Engagement by William Friedkin). Dancer in the Dark reminded me of the maxim of American critic Paul Fussell, where all really bad things are the middlebrow things that think that they're really good. I would say one film sort of in that realm is The Piano. Dancer in the Dark astonished me in that it was so bad, I found it was incredibly pleased with itself. Bjork gave one of the worst and most arrogant performances I've ever seen on the screen, consciously or not using the technique of being supposedly semi-blind as being not willing to react in any meaningful way whatever with anybody else on the screen. </p> <p><strong>TM:</strong> Yet she won awards for her performance... ?</p> <p><strong>PB:</strong> What can I say? My palms are up in horror and despair. If she'd done what she wanted to originally, which was just do the music, maybe it would have been better. I seemed to be one of the few people at the time who remembered Dennis Potter's Pennies From Heaven, I walked around after the screening asking people if they'd heard of it, and most people under 30 hadn't. I don't know whether Lars Von Trier has seen it, but Dennis Potter did that sort of thing much better. </p> <p><strong>TM:</strong> Derek Malcolm, are you prepared to mount a defence?</p> <p><strong>DM:</strong>Well, the person sitting next to me at the screening thought it was a masterpiece, and the one on the other side thought it was a load of you-know-what, and I'm sort of in the middle. Von Trier is a very good film-maker who's badly misjudged something. That's all. He can mount scenes that are extraordinary, the final scene is pretty extraordinary in a way, and Bjork is sometimes very good. But the whole thing is completely manipulative and forces you to sit there: now you will cry, now you will laugh, now you will sing.</p> <p><strong>PB:</strong> I thought that it was extraordinary that it seemed to be set in some unspecified period in the past - the 50s or 60s. Does Von Trier not understand that the death penalty still exists in America today and he could have set it there?</p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> I think it's a really sloppy and really creepy film. Von Trier has given up on all the things that made him interesting as a director. He used to do mad baroque constructions, lots of complex, unsettling imagery. He was going to be a toy Scandinavian Orson Welles. But the video look he uses, I really think he's milked it to death. I thought Bjork was terrible in this. I think the worst thing about it is this fetish he has about saintly female suffering which he was able to pull off in Breaking the Waves, but he doesn't pull it off here because Bjork is just...I don't know. The songs were horrible, the narrative was horrible. There's something really sanctimonious about it. I thought it was very bold of Film Four to have a money-back offer for anyone who didn't like it. I'm only sorry it didn't extend to critics.</p> <p><strong>DM:</strong>And yet, you know, it won the best film in Europe, and that came from the European Film Academy, so obviously an awful lot of people were affected by it and did think it was good. But don't you think it's probably the critics who know his work that can see that he's doing [the same thing] over and over again, whereas for the general public it may be the first film of his that they see. We say to ourselves, 'Ugh! Not again!' And worse.</p> <p><strong>PB:</strong> I'd concede that the very first scene, where Catherine Deneuve is doing a sort of am-dram production of The Sound of Music, was so bizarre and so interesting that it was almost - but not quite - worth the price of admission.</p> <p><strong>SUMMER BLOCKBUSTERS</strong> </p> <p><strong>TM:</strong> During the summer months, tales of patriotism, bravery and mutant super-heroism ruled the screens. George Clooney braved the waves of <strong>The Perfect Storm</strong>, cat-suited heroes did battle in <strong>X-Men</strong> and Mel Gibson went at the English with <strong>The Patriot</strong>. Jonathan, why do so many of the big summer films seem aimed at a male audience?</p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> It's a guy thing I guess. Maybe American males go out more in summer. I've no idea. Maybe it's something to do with sweat and testosterone. I think X-Men wasn't particularly regarded as a male-oriented film, and neither was Perfect Storm targeted at a male audience because it has George Clooney in it, wearing a wet t-shirt for the entire film. I thought Perfect Storm was the wash-out it promised to be. It was very wet, and that was about it. I've never seen so much digitally generated water, and that was the only thing I could remember from the entire film. The Patriot I haven't seen, because I thought it would affirm this terrible aversion I have to Mel Gibson who was also in one of the worst films of the year, Million Dollar Hotel, in which he wore a sort-of sci-fi neck brace which accentuated his stiffness - the perfect role for him. </p> <p>X-Men: I've been disappointed for years because when I was a young thing I was obsessed with Marvel comics, and I used to dream that somebody would make a great film, and I think we're going to have to wait for Spiderman. I think the trouble with X-Men was there's nothing going on in it. The trouble with digital effects is that you can do anything. The director can come along and say, 'Let's have them float in mid-air' and...</p> <p><strong>DM:</strong>Well there's no wonder, is there? We all know it's digital now.</p> <p><strong>TM:</strong> Did any of these films hold anything for you, Derek?</p> <p><strong>DM:</strong>No. I think the bigger they get the more they're flattened out. They've got to appeal to everybody all over the world and at least a third of those who go to see it don't speak English anyway, so what's the point in a script?</p> <p><strong>TM:</strong> George Clooney's had a number of shots at being a movie star. Is 2000 the year that he made it?</p> <p><strong>DM:</strong>No, I think he probably made it before. He's an incredibly popular actor. He's got a lot of charm and a certain amount of lightness of touch if the director can only give him something to do. He was good in the Coen Brothers' film.</p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> In the Coen Brothers' film, <strong>Oh Brother where Art Thou</strong>, I thought he really stood out as someone who didn't have a funny bone in his body. I think as a kind of action man with a light touch, like in Three Kings, he comes off very well. But being funny, a funny Clark Gable character, he doesn't seem like a funny guy. He tries to mock his narcissism, but he comes across as almost doubly narcissistic because of it.</p> <p><strong>PB:</strong> I thought he was pretty good in Oh Brother Where Art Thou, quite funny - he wasn't brilliant. Can I make a tiny plea in favour of X-Men? I didn't think it was that bad, I thought it had some good things about it. I quite liked Ian McKellen and I quite liked Wolverine's fighting scene at the beginning.</p> <p><strong>TM:</strong> Why is it that villains in Hollywood films always seem to be played by British Actors?</p> <p><strong>PB:</strong> That's such a perennial isn't it? I think it comes back to <strong>The Patriot</strong>. America is yearning for something which the politically correct yearn for most of all which is victim status. It's not something which white American WASPS can carry off very easily, except in relationship to English people. They can somehow ventriloquise the Irish experience or even ventriloquise they're own experience in the 1776 war.</p> <p><strong>TM:</strong> They played very fast and loose in The Patriot with actual historical fact, and this shows how irrelevant Britain is on the international scene.</p> <p><strong>PB:</strong> Utterly irrelevant. I think what annoyed people about The Patriot was not simply that the English were bad guys, Spike Lee objected to the fact that none of the heroes owned slaves, an historical impossibility, but that a scene in Nazi history seemed to have been taken out of context and cut and pasted into this context. It was the Nazis who herded people into a church and burnt them, not the Brits.</p> <p><strong>TM:</strong> The violence in The Patriot was particularly brutal and explicit. Is this something that you've noticed this year as becoming more and more of a trend?</p> <p><strong>DM:</strong>No, I think that's not true really. There's not enough sex and not enough violence sometimes. It's a subject that they do very badly, violence is just so comic now that you just have to laugh.</p> <p><strong>TM:</strong> But you tend to see heads flying off bodies and arteries spurting blood and it's all very realistic.</p> <p><strong>DM:</strong>You do but it's totally fantastic and silly.</p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> The only thing that offended me in a blockbuster this year was in <strong>X-Men</strong> at the beginning, where there was a completely gratuitous use of the holocaust. The origin of Magneto is an Auschwitz scene. What are they thinking? The really offensive thing is that it cost several million dollars just to recreate Auschwitz for a 10-minute scene, and this was the dumbest thing about the film, and the most thoughtless thing I've seen in a Hollywood movie the whole year.</p> <p><strong>TM:</strong> One other film that managed to garner strong reviews and potent box-office action was Ridley Scott's <strong>Gladiator</strong>, a Roman-age action-drama that made a bona-fide star of its hero Russell Crowe. Gladiator was one of the most successful movies of 2000, but it could have been made in a far earlier era. Despite its special effects it was a film that harked back to the big Technicolor toga epics of the 1950s. In an era of blockbusters, this was an epic.</p> <p><strong>PB:</strong> It was an epic, yes, but sort of like Derek was saying about X-Men, because you know that they haven't really hired all those people, they're just digitally created effects, it doesn't have quite the same effect as something like Spartacus would have had. </p> <p><strong>DM:</strong>Even Oliver Reed was digitally created.</p> <p><strong>PB:</strong> I thought it was great. I enjoyed Gladiator very much. I thought Russell Crowe was great. I thought he was a real old-fashioned star. Maybe a little bit hammy, and a little bit camp, I thought the ghosts of Lawrence Olivier and Tony Curtis were hovering over his pecs.</p> <p><strong>TM:</strong> He has something of the same quality as Harrison Ford, in the sense that he's a sort of gentle action hero, men admire him, women like him, they fancy him, do you think he's a star to watch?</p> <p><strong>DM:</strong>Well he's sure better than Victor Mature was, put it that way! I don't know why he's been so praised for Gladiator, all he had to do was look noble and prove that he could do some gymnastics and the rest was digital effects. But it was a clever film in that it saw what we actually yearn for in those old films and gave it to us in spades. </p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> I didn't think it was camp at all. I don't think pecs are inherently camp, we all have them guys...</p> <p><strong>TM:</strong> You'll be asked to prove that later...</p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> I thought the interesting thing about Gladiator was that it wasn't terribly camp. I thought that they wouldn't be able to do it seriously, but in a sense they do. Considering what everyone was expecting it seemed to me to have a real sense of gravitas, because Ridley Scott, who I don't think has a camp sensibility, took it seriously. He took the genre for real and for me that's what made it appealing, he actually meant it and pulled it off brilliantly.</p> <p><strong>TM:</strong> Does this herald a crop of gladiator flicks?</p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> It could herald some cheap ones. I can't see many people trying to take this thing on. I would also differ on the subject of Russell Crowe because I think in the past he has been an extraordinary actor, he was in an incredible Australian film called proof years ago and in this... well he's clearly required by Hollywood to be a good brooder. He sulks and scowls very well, but he wasn't really having to do much else and I think this is the problem. I think there is this syndrome whereby people that can really act are brought into the big productions and told, 'Right. Stand there' and are told to just scowl and exude charisma and the rest is up to the effects guys.</p> <p><strong>PB:</strong> The other thing to say about Gladiator is that it was a chick-flick. A huge section of its audience was female. It wasn't a man's film as such.</p> <p> <strong>THE BEST AND WORST OF 2000</strong></p> <p><strong>TM:</strong> Before we wind up, I'd like to ask you all whether the year 2000 will go down as a vintage year for film. </p> <p><strong>DM:</strong>Absolutely not. When you get films like Gladiator and Erin Brockovich suggested for the Oscars you know it's a weak year. But it's had one or two good films, and I think Asian cinema, and I know we've seen very little of it in this country, came up trumps at Cannes. There were some wonderful films from Asia, whether we'll ever see them here I don't know, but I hope we will. So it's been an awful year for Hollywood, not a very good year for Britain, except for The House of Mirth, Terence Davies' film, and in my opinion, nothing much from Europe, but Asia's come up trumps. So what do we say? It's not a good year, but there's a glimmer of light from an unexpected quarter.</p> <p><strong>TM:</strong> What was your personal favourite?</p> <p><strong>DM:</strong>Of British films, <strong>The House of Mirth</strong>. It really surprised me how wonderful Gillian Anderson was. My other favourite, though no-one's seen it yet, is Edward Yang's <strong>Li Li</strong>, or A One and a Two, which is a family saga, three hours long, but I was absolutely held by it throughout. One of the best films I've seen this year from any quarter.</p> <p><strong>TM:</strong> And your most overrated film of the year?</p> <p><strong>DM:</strong>American Beauty.</p> <p><strong>TM:</strong> Jonathan. Your favourite and worst films.</p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> The big disappointment this year was that some of the tried and tested names came up with real duds, or in some cases worse. Martin Scorsese's Bringing Out The Dead was really dull. Wim Wenders' Million Dollar Hotel was one of the worst films of the year, Jane Campion likewise with Holy Smoke. Magnolia was one of the best films by far. Some of the best films were from Europe - Claire Denis' film, Beau Travail, her foreign legion reworking of the Billy Bud story. The film that won Cannes the year before, Rosetta by the Dardenne brothers was one of the films that made me think old-school social realism could still do the stuff. The real horror of the year for me was the wild and insane overrating of Billy Elliot, which I think is a really terrible, mawkish, manipulative film. But I didn't hate it as much as when people started calling it the greatest film of the year, or the greatest British film ever made. I think people have lost all sense of proportion, all sense of history and the film left a really nasty taste in my mouth.</p> <p><strong>TM:</strong> Peter, what were your highs and lows?</p> <p><strong>PB:</strong> I'd certainly agree with Derek about the non-Anglophone movies. My best film of the year is Wong Kar-Wei's In the Mood for Love, I thought it was a really really lovely film. Again, there were some lovely French films, certainly Beau Travail and Rosetta. A film I very much admired, I know Jonathan won't agree with me, was Bruno Dumont's Humanit\u00e9</p> <p><strong>DM:</strong>I liked that too.</p> <p><strong>PB:</strong> It was a deeply interesting film. It was overblown and glacially slow, but it was a very interesting film. </p> <p><strong>TM:</strong> Thank you very much to you all.</p> <p> <strong>Listen to sound clips</strong><br> \u0095 Peter Bradshaw on <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/critics/1219dancer.ra\">Dancer in the Dark</a> (49 seconds) <br>\u0095 Jonathan Romney on <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/critics/1219magnolia.ra\">Magnolia</a> (1min 03) <br>\u0095 Peter Bradshaw on <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/critics/1219villains.ra\">Hollywood's use of British villains</a> (28 seconds) <br>\u0095 Derek Malcolm on <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/critics/1219year.ra\">his personal favourites of the year</a> (39 seconds)</p> <p> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/audio/radio/0,8685,411327,00.html\">More about Guardian Unlimited's week of radio broadcasts</a> <br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/audio/radio/filmpanel/0,8709,411912,00.html\">Meet the panel</a> <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/article/0,5814,387922,00.html\"> How do I listen to audio?</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Guardian Unlimited asked Guardian film critics Peter Bradshaw, Derek Malcolm and Jonathan Romney to discuss the highs and lows of the past year in film with journalist, producer and broadcaster Tracey MacLeod. You can listen to the entire broadcast on Friday December 22 (details at the bottom of the page), in the meantime, read the transcript below. TM: With me to discuss the biggest films and the key developments of 2000 are the Guardian film critic, Peter Bradshaw, who combines his reviewing activities with writing the Tad Friendly column in London's Evening Standard and is about to make his own screen debut as co-writer and performer in David Baddiel's new sitcom. Derek Malcolm, who served as the Guardian's film critic for three decades. He's just put the finishing touches to his selection of his one hundred favourite films of the 20th century, and at Cannes was presented with a medal for his services to cinema by the president, Gilles Jacob. As well as being an arts columnist for the Guardian, Jonathan Romney is film critic for the New Statesman. Let's start by remembering what's always the high-point of the film year - the Oscars. This year saw a sweet triumph for emerging British talent when American Beauty, a Hollywood film helmed by London theatre director Sam Mendes, scooped the trophies for best picture, director and actor for its star, Kevin Spacey. The British recipient for the Best Supporting Actor was Michael Caine for his performance in an American movie, The Cider House Rules. Sir Michael - or should that be Sir Maurice? - used a subsequent Bafta ceremony to berate what he saw as English snobbery in the film industry. More controversy surrounded the year's big summer blockbuster, The Patriot, set during the American War of Independence. Mel Gibson played an heroic plantation owner battling against genocidal English soldiers and, unsurprisingly, the film was largely shunned in British cinemas. Here, summer audiences seemed more attracted to the less partisan charms of X-Men, which at least balanced its English-accented villain, Ian McKellen, with an English-accented hero, Patrick Stewart. AMERICAN BEAUTY But lets go back to the film that swept the board on Oscar night. A tart tale of one man's mid-life crisis, American Beauty opened in January to rave reviews and strong box-office and looks set to finish the year on most British top 10 lists. Peter, American Beauty was that rare thing, a critical success that also captured the public's imagination. Is it going to finish the year on your top 10 list? PB: I'm not sure. When I first saw it I was very much taken with it, I thought it was terrific, very well acted and Sam Mendes had assembled a beautifully modulated cast, all giving first-rate performances. But I think it was over-praised and we all became rather over-excited about it. It's a bit like candyfloss, it kind of reduces in the mouth and you think, well what was the fuss about, frankly? I think it was a very good film and it was very intelligently directed. I'm not sure how far we should claim it as a British success, although Sam Mendes is obviously British, it was more of a success for the mighty Dreamworks studio in steamrollering us all into thinking that this was a very classy film. But it is a good film, but a little over praised. DM: I agree totally. I can't understand exactly why it was so successful, all I can say is it's Magnolia lite. Magnolia was a much more original and audacious film. American Beauty was very well made, and certainly Sam Mendes is a very fine director and he put it together extremely well, but at the end of it I don't think it says anything original about America at all. TM: Jonathan, it entered some dark and dangerous territory in its hero's obsession with an underage girl. Was it refreshing that a film that dealt with dangerous subjects did so well at the Oscars? JR: Well, it's only refreshing if it starts dangerous and stays dangerous. I thought it was a very glib, light film. Very glib treatment of the sort of things that people like David Lynch have taken on before. The whole idea of suburbia and mid-life crisis was done superbly in Ang Lee's film, The Ice Storm, American Beauty didn't come near it. I thought also Wonderboys - completely underrated - a Michael Douglas film by Curtis Hanson, did the mid-life crisis with much more intelligence and wry wit. There's also a problem in American Beauty in that Kevin Spacey's performance has become the great stereotype of his age, he's found his riff just in the way Jack Nicholson has. And after seeing this film I think I've seen all of Kevin Spacey that I want to see for a long while. PB: I think Jonathan's right, the thing about it being somehow dangerous that he's obsessed with these young women. That not dangerous at all. What would have been dangerous would have been for him to actually have sex with Mena Suvari. That would have been really dangerous. But the whole Hollywood Puritanism came crashing down at the end of that film, and no sexual denouement was going to be allowed. Instead there was a very false, violent denouement that was conjured up out of nowhere. As to Kevin Spacey's performance, it is terrific, but Jonathan's right in that Kevin Spacey is capable of giving very disappointing performances, for example in Ordinary, Decent Criminals, an Irish film which was appalling, and he was clearly on that same note, but not very well directed or written. TM: Obviously he and Sam Mendes developed a very good working relationship. Is this going to be a hard act to follow for Mendes? DM: I don't think it will be a hard act, he's a sensible guy and I don't think that he's going to try and make some huge Hollywood film straight afterwards. In fact I think he'd rather make a small film after this. I think he'll continue to make good films, even better films. They may not be so successful... MAGNOLIA and BEING JOHN MALKOVICH TM: Two other films that narrowly missed out on big Oscar wins, but were nonetheless huge critical successes are Paul Thomas Anderson's sprawling Los Angeles mosaic, Magnolia, and the willfully iconoclastic Being John Malkovich, in which John Cusack's lonely puppeteer discovers a portal that leads him inside the head of the famous movie actor. Derek Malcolm, you're a huge fan of Magnolia, does this stake Anderson's claim as being a great movie director? DM: I don't know about a great director, but he's certainly a very good and original one. I loathe long films, but I sat through that even though it was too long. It tells you everything that American Beauty doesn't tell you about American society in a much bolder way. What I like about the film is that he actually lets people act, he doesn't cut scenes in a convenient Hollywood way at all. That's why the film's so long, I suppose. Every bit of the film had wonderful moments in it, but it could have been cut by 45 minutes and still been a wonderful film. But I'm glad it wasn't because there are moments all the time which are simply not the moments Hollywood gives us. JR: I agree. I think Paul Thomas Anderson is absolutely brilliant. I think he's got more energy as a storyteller, as someone who's inventing visual ideas, as someone who's inventing tricks, as someone who's trying to engage the audience, than anyone else in Hollywood at the moment. People are comparing him now to Robert Altman in the 70s. I think he wants to be the Californian Balzac - he wants to take the whole of Californian society and cram it in as much as he can. This film goes all over the place. It's definitely what you would call a 'flawed masterpiece', I think a flaw can make a masterpiece, it's nearly a masterpiece. It's the flaws - too much energy in one place, too many ideas to cram in, I was really tired of the film after two hours and I thought 'enough', but suddenly he turns it round with this boost of energy. It's got the weirdest and most spectacular last-minute twist, the most apocalyptic of any film I've seen in years. PB: Yes. I thought it was an incredibly exciting film, very rarely do I feel excited by the prospect of a film and almost continually excited all the way through it. I think he's a very good director of certain types of actors, his repertory player, Philip Baker Hall, seems to turn up in nearly every American film because of his addled old face, to give some character-actor class, Paul Thomas Anderson used him brilliantly. Also Tom Cruise, who is routinely reviled as being the worst thing in the world, was very very good in this. TM: It's an ensemble film in the tradition of Robert Altman, and this presents different problems for a director. Do you think it is easier to create a great portmanteau film than one with a linear story? PB: I'm not sure. Portmanteau films can go all to pieces, and this almost went all to pieces, but in an interesting way. Also, as well as its sprawlingness it's also the loudest film I've ever been to. Especially at the beginning when the soundtrack is turned up to ear-splitting levels, and over the dialogue as well. I didn't have a problem with this - I thought it was great. TM: Do you think film critics sometimes have a different perception of films than your average film-goer because they have to see films in the morning? PB: I've seen it in the morning and I've seen it in the evening, and every time I've liked it. I think sometimes critics like this sort of film more than the public. We are so used to rubbish and boring nonsense with dull and derivative narratives, that when something new, that doesn't rely so heavily on conventional narrative is presented to us, we get very overexcited. Though it's justified in this case. TM: Memento would be a case in point, it's been critically praised but I found myself quite turned off by the narrative device, the plot running backwards. But if you see five or 10 films a week, I would imagine that it would appeal more. PB: Well, that's true. Memento, like Magnolia, is not a Friday-night movie. It's still a great film. TM: Moving on to Being John Malkovich. It introduced us to this imaginative world, full of possibilities. I was disappointed that it didn't prove to be a portal into a more interesting place. DM: I saw it at the Venice festival, and everyone came out saying, 'That was an interesting film', and it was only after that that everybody seemed to say it was much more than that. I think the last reel isn't anything like as good as the rest of the film, but up to that point I thought it was about the most original American film I'd seen for a very long time. It does all sorts of things that are not done by Hollywood at all, and it does them pretty well, but the last reel suggests that there's not much more to say. TM: Jonathan, was it one of your films of the year? JR: Yes, definitely. I think again it's this idea of a film being flawed that tells you that the film-makers are trying to do something extra that might not quite come off. I agree that the energy may have flagged, but you start off with a high-concept idea - imagine if you could go into the head of John Malkovich and be him for a moment. Then you ask, why John Malkovich? and then you realise that's just part of a whole heap of ideas which aren't fully developed and they don't gel. But there's some really extraordinary stuff. People keep saying that British cinema needs to keep up with America, but the interesting American films - Fight Club, Being John Malkovich, Magnolia - are so far removed from anything we can do here. The rules are being reinvented. TM: I wonder if we could be seeing a period where the maverick auteur director comes into his own in the same way that Scorsese and Coppola did in the 1970s? PB: That's what you hope, and we hoped that up to and including Oscar night this year when they all disappeared. I haven't got that excited about these people since then, and the paucity of the material available for the next Oscars seems to bear that out. I'd like to agree with Jonathan, except about Fight Club... DM: I think it is true, but those films don't actually make very much money, so I don't think Hollywood will continue to back them. Hollywood backs money and these people are unlikely to be making blockbusters. So for us this is a new wave of film-making which is extremely valuable, but for the general public, maybe not. JR: I think the problem is that I don't see anyone who's going to have a great run of movies like Altman or Scorsese. Maybe Paul Thomas Anderson or Spike Jonze will have one or two great shots, but my theory is that after that they will be institutionalised very fast. This happened with Brian Singer, who made Usual Suspects, but then signed up and made X-Men, which is shiny and nothing. DANCER IN THE DARK TM: Let's talk about European maverick Lars Von Trier. The most important date in the European film calendar is Cannes, and this year it whipped up its own controversy when it awarded best film to Von Trier's Dancer in the Dark. A sort of kitchen-sink-death-row-musical, Dancer in the Dark divided its audience - either you loved it or you hated it. Peter, you called it 'sensationally silly, shallow, crudely manipulative'. PB: It's not my worst film of the year (that goes to Rules of Engagement by William Friedkin). Dancer in the Dark reminded me of the maxim of American critic Paul Fussell, where all really bad things are the middlebrow things that think that they're really good. I would say one film sort of in that realm is The Piano. Dancer in the Dark astonished me in that it was so bad, I found it was incredibly pleased with itself. Bjork gave one of the worst and most arrogant performances I've ever seen on the screen, consciously or not using the technique of being supposedly semi-blind as being not willing to react in any meaningful way whatever with anybody else on the screen. TM: Yet she won awards for her performance... ? PB: What can I say? My palms are up in horror and despair. If she'd done what she wanted to originally, which was just do the music, maybe it would have been better. I seemed to be one of the few people at the time who remembered Dennis Potter's Pennies From Heaven, I walked around after the screening asking people if they'd heard of it, and most people under 30 hadn't. I don't know whether Lars Von Trier has seen it, but Dennis Potter did that sort of thing much better. TM: Derek Malcolm, are you prepared to mount a defence? DM:Well, the person sitting next to me at the screening thought it was a masterpiece, and the one on the other side thought it was a load of you-know-what, and I'm sort of in the middle. Von Trier is a very good film-maker who's badly misjudged something. That's all. He can mount scenes that are extraordinary, the final scene is pretty extraordinary in a way, and Bjork is sometimes very good. But the whole thing is completely manipulative and forces you to sit there: now you will cry, now you will laugh, now you will sing. PB: I thought that it was extraordinary that it seemed to be set in some unspecified period in the past - the 50s or 60s. Does Von Trier not understand that the death penalty still exists in America today and he could have set it there? JR: I think it's a really sloppy and really creepy film. Von Trier has given up on all the things that made him interesting as a director. He used to do mad baroque constructions, lots of complex, unsettling imagery. He was going to be a toy Scandinavian Orson Welles. But the video look he uses, I really think he's milked it to death. I thought Bjork was terrible in this. I think the worst thing about it is this fetish he has about saintly female suffering which he was able to pull off in Breaking the Waves, but he doesn't pull it off here because Bjork is just...I don't know. The songs were horrible, the narrative was horrible. There's something really sanctimonious about it. I thought it was very bold of Film Four to have a money-back offer for anyone who didn't like it. I'm only sorry it didn't extend to critics. DM:And yet, you know, it won the best film in Europe, and that came from the European Film Academy, so obviously an awful lot of people were affected by it and did think it was good. But don't you think it's probably the critics who know his work that can see that he's doing [the same thing] over and over again, whereas for the general public it may be the first film of his that they see. We say to ourselves, 'Ugh! Not again!' And worse. PB: I'd concede that the very first scene, where Catherine Deneuve is doing a sort of am-dram production of The Sound of Music, was so bizarre and so interesting that it was almost - but not quite - worth the price of admission. SUMMER BLOCKBUSTERS TM: During the summer months, tales of patriotism, bravery and mutant super-heroism ruled the screens. George Clooney braved the waves of The Perfect Storm, cat-suited heroes did battle in X-Men and Mel Gibson went at the English with The Patriot. Jonathan, why do so many of the big summer films seem aimed at a male audience? JR: It's a guy thing I guess. Maybe American males go out more in summer. I've no idea. Maybe it's something to do with sweat and testosterone. I think X-Men wasn't particularly regarded as a male-oriented film, and neither was Perfect Storm targeted at a male audience because it has George Clooney in it, wearing a wet t-shirt for the entire film. I thought Perfect Storm was the wash-out it promised to be. It was very wet, and that was about it. I've never seen so much digitally generated water, and that was the only thing I could remember from the entire film. The Patriot I haven't seen, because I thought it would affirm this terrible aversion I have to Mel Gibson who was also in one of the worst films of the year, Million Dollar Hotel, in which he wore a sort-of sci-fi neck brace which accentuated his stiffness - the perfect role for him. X-Men: I've been disappointed for years because when I was a young thing I was obsessed with Marvel comics, and I used to dream that somebody would make a great film, and I think we're going to have to wait for Spiderman. I think the trouble with X-Men was there's nothing going on in it. The trouble with digital effects is that you can do anything. The director can come along and say, 'Let's have them float in mid-air' and... DM:Well there's no wonder, is there? We all know it's digital now. TM: Did any of these films hold anything for you, Derek? DM:No. I think the bigger they get the more they're flattened out. They've got to appeal to everybody all over the world and at least a third of those who go to see it don't speak English anyway, so what's the point in a script? TM: George Clooney's had a number of shots at being a movie star. Is 2000 the year that he made it? DM:No, I think he probably made it before. He's an incredibly popular actor. He's got a lot of charm and a certain amount of lightness of touch if the director can only give him something to do. He was good in the Coen Brothers' film. JR: In the Coen Brothers' film, Oh Brother where Art Thou, I thought he really stood out as someone who didn't have a funny bone in his body. I think as a kind of action man with a light touch, like in Three Kings, he comes off very well. But being funny, a funny Clark Gable character, he doesn't seem like a funny guy. He tries to mock his narcissism, but he comes across as almost doubly narcissistic because of it. PB: I thought he was pretty good in Oh Brother Where Art Thou, quite funny - he wasn't brilliant. Can I make a tiny plea in favour of X-Men? I didn't think it was that bad, I thought it had some good things about it. I quite liked Ian McKellen and I quite liked Wolverine's fighting scene at the beginning. TM: Why is it that villains in Hollywood films always seem to be played by British Actors? PB: That's such a perennial isn't it? I think it comes back to The Patriot. America is yearning for something which the politically correct yearn for most of all which is victim status. It's not something which white American WASPS can carry off very easily, except in relationship to English people. They can somehow ventriloquise the Irish experience or even ventriloquise they're own experience in the 1776 war. TM: They played very fast and loose in The Patriot with actual historical fact, and this shows how irrelevant Britain is on the international scene. PB: Utterly irrelevant. I think what annoyed people about The Patriot was not simply that the English were bad guys, Spike Lee objected to the fact that none of the heroes owned slaves, an historical impossibility, but that a scene in Nazi history seemed to have been taken out of context and cut and pasted into this context. It was the Nazis who herded people into a church and burnt them, not the Brits. TM: The violence in The Patriot was particularly brutal and explicit. Is this something that you've noticed this year as becoming more and more of a trend? DM:No, I think that's not true really. There's not enough sex and not enough violence sometimes. It's a subject that they do very badly, violence is just so comic now that you just have to laugh. TM: But you tend to see heads flying off bodies and arteries spurting blood and it's all very realistic. DM:You do but it's totally fantastic and silly. JR: The only thing that offended me in a blockbuster this year was in X-Men at the beginning, where there was a completely gratuitous use of the holocaust. The origin of Magneto is an Auschwitz scene. What are they thinking? The really offensive thing is that it cost several million dollars just to recreate Auschwitz for a 10-minute scene, and this was the dumbest thing about the film, and the most thoughtless thing I've seen in a Hollywood movie the whole year. TM: One other film that managed to garner strong reviews and potent box-office action was Ridley Scott's Gladiator, a Roman-age action-drama that made a bona-fide star of its hero Russell Crowe. Gladiator was one of the most successful movies of 2000, but it could have been made in a far earlier era. Despite its special effects it was a film that harked back to the big Technicolor toga epics of the 1950s. In an era of blockbusters, this was an epic. PB: It was an epic, yes, but sort of like Derek was saying about X-Men, because you know that they haven't really hired all those people, they're just digitally created effects, it doesn't have quite the same effect as something like Spartacus would have had. DM:Even Oliver Reed was digitally created. PB: I thought it was great. I enjoyed Gladiator very much. I thought Russell Crowe was great. I thought he was a real old-fashioned star. Maybe a little bit hammy, and a little bit camp, I thought the ghosts of Lawrence Olivier and Tony Curtis were hovering over his pecs. TM: He has something of the same quality as Harrison Ford, in the sense that he's a sort of gentle action hero, men admire him, women like him, they fancy him, do you think he's a star to watch? DM:Well he's sure better than Victor Mature was, put it that way! I don't know why he's been so praised for Gladiator, all he had to do was look noble and prove that he could do some gymnastics and the rest was digital effects. But it was a clever film in that it saw what we actually yearn for in those old films and gave it to us in spades. JR: I didn't think it was camp at all. I don't think pecs are inherently camp, we all have them guys... TM: You'll be asked to prove that later... JR: I thought the interesting thing about Gladiator was that it wasn't terribly camp. I thought that they wouldn't be able to do it seriously, but in a sense they do. Considering what everyone was expecting it seemed to me to have a real sense of gravitas, because Ridley Scott, who I don't think has a camp sensibility, took it seriously. He took the genre for real and for me that's what made it appealing, he actually meant it and pulled it off brilliantly. TM: Does this herald a crop of gladiator flicks? JR: It could herald some cheap ones. I can't see many people trying to take this thing on. I would also differ on the subject of Russell Crowe because I think in the past he has been an extraordinary actor, he was in an incredible Australian film called proof years ago and in this... well he's clearly required by Hollywood to be a good brooder. He sulks and scowls very well, but he wasn't really having to do much else and I think this is the problem. I think there is this syndrome whereby people that can really act are brought into the big productions and told, 'Right. Stand there' and are told to just scowl and exude charisma and the rest is up to the effects guys. PB: The other thing to say about Gladiator is that it was a chick-flick. A huge section of its audience was female. It wasn't a man's film as such. THE BEST AND WORST OF 2000 TM: Before we wind up, I'd like to ask you all whether the year 2000 will go down as a vintage year for film. DM:Absolutely not. When you get films like Gladiator and Erin Brockovich suggested for the Oscars you know it's a weak year. But it's had one or two good films, and I think Asian cinema, and I know we've seen very little of it in this country, came up trumps at Cannes. There were some wonderful films from Asia, whether we'll ever see them here I don't know, but I hope we will. So it's been an awful year for Hollywood, not a very good year for Britain, except for The House of Mirth, Terence Davies' film, and in my opinion, nothing much from Europe, but Asia's come up trumps. So what do we say? It's not a good year, but there's a glimmer of light from an unexpected quarter. TM: What was your personal favourite? DM:Of British films, The House of Mirth. It really surprised me how wonderful Gillian Anderson was. My other favourite, though no-one's seen it yet, is Edward Yang's Li Li, or A One and a Two, which is a family saga, three hours long, but I was absolutely held by it throughout. One of the best films I've seen this year from any quarter. TM: And your most overrated film of the year? DM:American Beauty. TM: Jonathan. Your favourite and worst films. JR: The big disappointment this year was that some of the tried and tested names came up with real duds, or in some cases worse. Martin Scorsese's Bringing Out The Dead was really dull. Wim Wenders' Million Dollar Hotel was one of the worst films of the year, Jane Campion likewise with Holy Smoke. Magnolia was one of the best films by far. Some of the best films were from Europe - Claire Denis' film, Beau Travail, her foreign legion reworking of the Billy Bud story. The film that won Cannes the year before, Rosetta by the Dardenne brothers was one of the films that made me think old-school social realism could still do the stuff. The real horror of the year for me was the wild and insane overrating of Billy Elliot, which I think is a really terrible, mawkish, manipulative film. But I didn't hate it as much as when people started calling it the greatest film of the year, or the greatest British film ever made. I think people have lost all sense of proportion, all sense of history and the film left a really nasty taste in my mouth. TM: Peter, what were your highs and lows? PB: I'd certainly agree with Derek about the non-Anglophone movies. My best film of the year is Wong Kar-Wei's In the Mood for Love, I thought it was a really really lovely film. Again, there were some lovely French films, certainly Beau Travail and Rosetta. A film I very much admired, I know Jonathan won't agree with me, was Bruno Dumont's Humanit\u00e9 DM:I liked that too. PB: It was a deeply interesting film. It was overblown and glacially slow, but it was a very interesting film. TM: Thank you very much to you all.

The five-month strike, upheld by some 135,000 guild members, banned performers from making US advertisements until the flat-rate fee system which decides their pay, was replaced by a more advantageous one of repeat royalties. Union officials estimate that 80% of its members earn less than \u00a34,000 a year and it called on Hollywood's richest actors to support the strike.

      "body": "<b> Wednesday</b> <p> Albert Agazerian teaches history at Bir Zeit University. He meets me just inside Bab el-Khalil gate and we walk towards the house where he lives with his family inside the Armenian convent grounds. He points out the first British consulate and the first British church: \"Layers of history,\" he says. \"Dig here and you come up with at least 17 layers of history - and their stories are all woven together. Here in Jerusalem we have what the whole world today is headed for: plurality. But the Israelis want to cancel everybody's story except their own.\" </p> <p>Madeleine, his wife, insists on giving me a jar of their olives. Her family has always got their olives from a particular farm near Nablus. Now the farmers are fighting not only the closures, she says, but the settlers who set fire to the olive groves or take chainsaws to the trees.\"The farmers,\" she tells me, \"slip out on Friday night and gather their own harvest while the settlers keep the sabbath.\" It's as though they have to steal their own crop. </p> <p>My attempts to reach the other side of all this have so far not been successful. Shlomo Shamir, sometime Israeli ambassador to Egypt, could not see me because he was investigating the killings of the 13 Arab-Israelis in Israel. </p> <p>Could we not talk about broader issues? </p> <p>No. They are all related. </p> <p>Gershon Baskin, who specialises in getting Arabs and Israelis together, has not returned my calls. </p> <p>I am still trying to speak to someone from the Yesha council to arrange a meeting with a settler. It's not simple. From the first word it's not simple: I have often been asked whether I have a problem with English as the \"language of my oppressor\". I understand the question but I do not feel it; the British occupation was out of Egypt before I was born. English was the language of my first reading and I love it. </p> <p>When the voice at the other end of the phone said \"Shalom\" I said \"Shalom\" back out of courtesy. I was left with a nasty feeling; a feeling that I had been somehow complicit. For the remaining seven calls I would respond with \"Good morning/evening\". When the Israeli army of occupation has been removed from the streets of Palestine I will say \"Shalom\" to a Jewish visitor to the Holy Land as I would join my hands and bow my head to an Indian one. </p> <p>And if a meeting should be arranged, how would I get there? My Palestinian driver won't go near a settlement. And who will I get to go in with me? For there is no way I am going alone. </p> <p>Last night I walked back to my hotel up Salah el-Din Street. I was still wearing the headscarf I wore at al-Aqsa and my dress reached to just above my ankles. I passed the barred building which I now know is the Israeli court. In front of it was the armoured car and four soldiers with the obligatory machine-guns. They were laughing together and I also thought that in the space of two days my fear had disappeared, my heart did not lurch. I must have taken 30 paces or so and was about to turn the corner when I felt something hit my left shoulder hard and heard the crack as whatever it was ricocheted off me and hit - I suppose - the ground. What did I feel? I felt shock as I turned ice-cold then hot. I felt my throat block up and the tears rise to my eyes, and then I felt pure anger and I turned. As I looked at the ground to try to identify what had hit me one of the transits that carry people between towns screeched to a stop by my side. The door was pulled open and inside I saw women who looked like me, and children. The driver leaned over: \"Are you all right?\" </p> <p>\"Yes,\" I said. I found that I was feeling ashamed, ashamed of having been hit. \"Did you see who hit me?\" I looked around the street. It was deserted except for the soldiers. </p> <p>\"No, we just heard the sound. Do you need help? We're going to Ramallah.\" </p> <p>\"My hotel's just round the corner.\" </p> <p>\"Don't wait here. Get in. I'll take you to the hotel.\" </p> <p>\"I'm all right,\" I said. </p> <p>\"God will punish them,\" a woman said. They did not drive off until I was round the corner and out of sight. </p> <p>When I got to my room I pushed the heavy table with my suitcase on it against the door. I took off my coat and dress. In the mirror I could see the purple bruise on my left shoulder. It did not hurt, but in my mind I kept walking back to the soldiers, challenging: \"Did you see who hit me?\" </p> <p> <b> Thursday</b></p> <p><b> 4.30pm</b> </p> <p>I am sitting in the lobby of the hotel when Judy Blanc walks in. Stylish and small with her grey hair worn short and close-fitting, she is unmistakeably a New Yorker. Her husband got a job as professor of Arabic at the Hebrew University in 1954 and she came with him. I have been told by my Palestinian friends that she is \"one in a million\". I ask her if this is true and she laughs \"not quite.\" She says that the recent events - terrible as they are - have been useful in clarifying the Palestinian's priorities. That the Israeli government can no longer manipulate the confusion between principles and negotiating positions. </p> <p>I ask her - it seems necessary to ask basic questions - where the \"good\" Israelis are? How can people, people who are aware that their government is subduing an entire population, cutting off their water and electricity, beating them up - I feel embarrassed at listing the misdeeds of the Israeli government to her - how can people, people with souls, tolerate this? </p> <p>\"But they're not aware, she says. It's so easy not to see it. You live in West Jerusalem or in Tel Aviv. You don't need to notice the Palestinians. If they're there they're in the background. And there is a fundamental racism in this society that makes it possible for people to delude themselves, to not see what's happening. If you want to know what's happening you have to go looking for it, to East Jerusalem or the West Bank. Not many Israelis will do that.\" </p> <p>Are there any Israelis working with Palestinians now? </p> <p>\"No. The Palestinians saw that the liberal position of making contact one on one was corrupting the political process. Now they do what the University of Bir Zeit has always done: any joint activity between Palestinians and Israelis has to be based upon the Israelis' articulated commitment to the minimum demands of the Palestinians: 242 and the Right of Return.\" </p> <p>What about Peace Now and similar organisations? </p> <p>\"They have a problem. They supported Ehud Barak and now they say he's gone as far as he can and the vio lence has to stop. The TV liberals are really hampered by the fact that they supported him. Do you know, one of my friends, a good liberal, said to me last week: 'I finally understood that Oslo was not the same for the Palestinians as it was for us.' It took her seven years.\" </p> <p> <b>2am</b> </p> <p> I have been in my room for the last four hours, writing up my notes. There is so much to write. I have pushed the curtains wide open on my huge window, outside there are the massed houses and, above them, the tiny sliver of the four-night-old crescent of Ramadan. Fasting has never been as easy as it is here. From time to time I hear a quick series of explosions but I'm no expert and they could be kids playing for all I know. </p> <p>Since I have been here I seem to have lost all apprehension (apart, that is, from the table wedged against the door). The contempt in which the people hold the army is infectious. \"They are cowards,\" one young man tells me. \"Let them just come out from behind their barricades, their helmets, their machine-guns and tanks and American technology. Let them meet us man to man, stone to stone.\"</p> <p>I am shedding aspects of me which are superfluous to the situation. I do not wonder for a second whether I should or should not ask a question: I have no concern to be liked. Not once have I had to drag my usually unruly mind back ot the business in hand. Every time I glance at it, it's working. completely focused, recording, recording. Maybe I'm shedding \"me\". And the bits of me that remain are the bits that cry as I write down the stories I hear. And the children look wonderingly at my tears and their mothers explain: \"It's all new to her.\"</p> <p>And were it not for my own children, back in London, I would stay. Stay in this city that brings out the cleanest and the clearest of me - and bear witness. </p> <p><b>Back to top of this article</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/departments/politicsphilosophyandsociety/story/0,6000,413355,00.html\">Under the gun</a></p> <p><b>Read part two</b><br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/departments/politicsphilosophyandsociety/story/0,6000,413354,00.html\">'Our world is upside down'</a></p>",

It is estimated that Madonna's event could bring \u00a31.5m to the local economy in the next few weeks. \"My mind has been in a buzz with it all,\" said Sandra Peterkin, of the Highlands tourist board. \"We couldn't buy the attention we have had from the world's media.\" The town plans to celebrate the nuptials in style. Nothing too showy - that wouldn't be \"the Dornoch way\". There will be a pipe band, bars will stay open longer, and the mobile cinema will show Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Desperately Seeking Susan as a tribute to the couple. Locals realise that what will be a most important day in Madonna's life will also be a big one in theirs.",

No conveyor-belt publishing here, no turgid potboiler-sequels, no catchpenny dreadfuls, no ghosted ghastlies, no bored and slapdash editors. </p> <p>A terrific spin-off of the PC/IT age is the way it encourages the self-publisher. One of the most talented and successful is the 53-year-old Bath educationalist, Stephen Chalke, who enthuses: \"Can't find a publisher? The book in you is too specialised, hasn't got a big name on the jacket, won't sell the 3,000 London publishers need to cover their overheads? So publish it yourself... and be surprised at how little it costs. Proofreading, indexing, creating computer files, packaging and distribution - sure, you can farm them all out, but the bills will soon mount if you do. Do it all yourself - and if you have typed your book on a computer, you have already done the hard work.\" </p> <p>Chalke this year triumphantly followed his acclaimed two rhapsodies in sepia on county cricket in the 1950s and 60s with his beguiling One More Run, romantic ruminations on the state of cricket then and now with one of the bygone circuit's legends, the off-spin bowler \"Bomber\" Wells. </p> <p>So zestfully proficient has been Chalke's one-man show since his first book in 1997 that this year he was distributor for another author-published book, Cricket Lovely Cricket, by Vijay Kumar, a valuable and beautifully produced memoir of one of the most historically relished, and relishable, tours of England - the 1950 West Indies tour of the Three Ws and, as the joyous calypso had it, \"those two little pals o' mine Ramadhin and Valentine\". Kumar, a New Yorker, interviewed every survivor of that seminal trip which so gloriously turned the cricket world's presumptive status quo on its head. </p> <p>Mind you, just about every one of this random selection of lovingly nurtured books is a cut above in production and presentation. You can almost feel the TLC put into them - from Chris Westcott's 258-page Cricket at the Saffrons, a handsome history of the venerable Eastbourne paddock, to Fraser Simm's delightful, pocket-sized 50-pager Saltire and Flannels on the greats of Scottish cricket from Aichison to Sievwright. In between come the more substantial 175-page biography by Basil Ashton Tinkler of \"Farmer\" White - A Somerset Hero Who Beat the Aussies and, at 192 pages, the warming and meticulous monograph by no less than three smitten authors in tribute to the remarkably loyal Brian Reynolds: The Times and Life of the Northamptonshire Sportsman. </p> <p>Booksellers have also turned to publishing. A stylish debut for Giles Lyon of Bodyline Books is Geoff Amey's unputdownable tragi-biog of Surrey's Victorian champion Julius Caesar, and Michael Down of Boundary Books has followed up David Frith's 1999 classic on England's pioneering tour to Australia in 1861 with Sir Michael Marshall's elegant centenary celebration of Arundel, Cricket At The Castle, in which, as you would expect, the innate goodness of the late Lord Cowdrey shines through. </p> <p>Once, it seemed, only Gloucester's cricket and rugby bard, the indefatigable Nico Craven, was the one annually intrepid solo pilot and author-publisher in the field, but the new desktop ease has been a boon to any club historian with a computer and a flair. The two centenary publications I have most enjoyed this year have been Ken Bernard's cheap and cheery History of Ilkley RUFC and Ross Reyburn's glossy splendour Life at the Graveyard, recording life and laughs at Moseley's Ashfield CC. </p> <p>Of the year's other sporting books not reeking of London lit's torpor and indifference, top three on the podium are Jim Holden's utterly illuminating and impressive life of Stan Cullis: The Iron Manager; David Instone's revealing warts-'n'-all portrait - which should have been printed in old-gold leaf - of Molineux benefactor (and much more) Sir Jack Hayward; and the \"authorised\" biography by David McVay and Andy Smith of England's all-time pre-eminent No9, the late Tommy Lawton, and whose title says it all, The Complete Centre-Forward. </p> <p><strong>One More Run</strong>, \u00a38, and <strong>Cricket Lovely Cricket</strong>, \u00a316.95, both from Fairfield Books, Bath BA1 6EY; <strong> Cricket at the Saffrons</strong>, \u00a317.99, Omnipress, Eastbourne BN21 3YD; <strong> Saltire &amp; Flannels</strong> , \u00a35.99, Simm, Stow, Selkirk TD1 2RD; <strong>\"Farmer\" White</strong>, \u00a316.95, Parrs Wood Press, Manchester M15 5BJ; <strong> Brian Reynolds</strong>, \u00a317, Diametric Press, Kettering NN15 6TF; <strong>Julius Caesar</strong>, \u00a310.95, Bodyline, Fulham, London SW6 6PH; <strong>Cricket at the Castle</strong>, \u00a313.95, Boundary, Goostrey, Cheshire CW4 8NT; <strong> Ilkley RUFC</strong>, \u00a35, Bernard, Ilkley, LS29 9BP; <strong> Life at the Graveyard</strong>, \u00a310, Slater Johnstone, Birmingham B2 5NY; <strong> Stan Cullis</strong>, \u00a314.99, Breedon, Derby DE21 4SZ; <strong> Sir Jack Hayward</strong>, \u00a312.99, Thomas Press, Newport, Salop TF10 7WT; <strong>The Complete Centre-Forward</strong>, \u00a314.99, SportsBooks, Worcester WR1 1HX. </p> <p><strong> Midnight Rugby</strong> </p> <p>Stephen Jones (Headline, \u00a318.99) </p> <p>Not so long ago, decent rugby union books were about as thin on the ground as snow at Christmas. Tour diaries, coaching manuals and ghastly ghost-written memoirs deserved to be given a firm hand-off come present-buying time. </p> <p>Now the game has a decent canon of literature, and any supporter would be pleased to unwrap the latest offering from the pack-leader of rugby writers, Stephen Jones, whose Midnight Rugby is a worthy successor to his 1993 classic Endless Winter. Since he began writing for Rugby World magazine some 20 years ago, the Sunday Times rugby correspondent has helped transform how the sport is reported; always controversial, always witty, but always sympathetic to the poor bloody infantry, the players. </p> <p>Also worth a mention is Rugby And All That by Martin Johnson (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a314.99), an often hilarious sideways look at the game by the Daily Telegraph writer. In another life, Johnson covered the sport for the Leicester Mercury, where he got close to the Tigers players. Too close sometimes - Johnson's probing risked him being dragged into the showers, clothes, notebook and all. </p> <p>Ian Malin</p> <p><strong>St Andrews and the Open Championship</strong> </p> <p>David Joy and Iain Macfarlane Lowe (Sleeping Bear, \u00a325) </p> <p>Like most Open champions Tiger Woods has had a replica of the trophy made. But I hope he also has something that, though not matching the replica, spells out and sums up just why he was so proud to win it. It is the official history of the event at St Andrews, and it is a treasure. </p> <p>Most official histories are dry and dusty affairs. Not this one. The introduction, for instance, plunges straight into the history of the town, recording that seven martyrs had been burnt at the stake in different parts of the town, adding: \"For what? Freedom of speech?\" Even while these events were taking place, golf was a part of St Andrews. </p> <p>It reveals that those supposedly haphazard bunkers on the Old Course were charted \"with all the care exercised in indicating sand-banks and sunk rocks in a mariners chart\" as early as 1842, and also tells the full and fascinating story of the demise through drink of the brilliant talent that was Young Tom Morris. </p> <p>The book takes us, compellingly, through the championships right up to 1995, and if it is not on hand in Tiger's house, it should be. Yours too. </p> <p>David Davies </p> <p><strong>It's not about the bike</strong> </p> <p>Lance Armstrong (Yellow Jersey, \u00a317) </p> <p>It is said that Lance Armstrong's transformation from testicular cancer patient to Tour de France winner is to be made into a film. But it is hard to see any movie doing justice to the script provided by Armstrong's own account, co-authored by Sally Jenkins and winner of this year's William Hill sports book of the year award. Having nearly lost his life, Armstrong has no qualms about serving it up on a plate for the rest of the world to wonder at, shudder at and learn from. </p> <p>Armstrong's attitude to his cancer is quasi-religious - \"the most important and shaping event in my life\" - but the account of his diagnosis and treatment is almost too down-to-earth. </p> <p>\"My testicle was horrendously swollen, almost to the size of an orange... Chemo was a continuous cough, hacking up chunks of mysterious, tar-like matter from deep in my chest.\" </p> <p>As the title implies, the pleasure and pain of cycling are on a different level altogether. </p> <p>William Fotheringham</p> <p><strong>Full Time</strong> </p> <p>Tony Cascarino with Paul Kimmage (Simon and Schuster, \u00a39.99) </p> <p>Compared with the standard-issue footballer's autobiography, this is Tolstoy. Football commentators have been quick to trumpet its honesty, its depth, its suggestion that there might, after all, be intelligent life out there. </p> <p>Its pleasures lie in what it has to say rather than in the quality of the prose. But what it says is astonishing. Because, in a world of obfuscation, cliche and false modesty, Tony Cascarino has been honest. </p> <p>The most compelling truth he admits to is a sense of personal inadequacy. Footballers are obliged to exude self-confidence. Cascarino's doubts, though, are huge. He and Kimmage communicate this by inventing an alter ego who sits on the player's shoulder and offers debilitating analysis of his performance. </p> <p>Drawing the link between Cascarino's gremlin and his father, a man whose guidance was restricted to the sneer and put-down, may be superficial analysis, but there are few football books that even allow us that luxury. </p> <p>Jim White</p>",

Also worth a mention is Rugby And All That by Martin Johnson (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a314.99), an often hilarious sideways look at the game by the Daily Telegraph writer. In another life, Johnson covered the sport for the Leicester Mercury, where he got close to the Tigers players. Too close sometimes - Johnson's probing risked him being dragged into the showers, clothes, notebook and all. Ian Malin St Andrews and the Open Championship David Joy and Iain Macfarlane Lowe (Sleeping Bear, \u00a325) Like most Open champions Tiger Woods has had a replica of the trophy made. But I hope he also has something that, though not matching the replica, spells out and sums up just why he was so proud to win it. It is the official history of the event at St Andrews, and it is a treasure. Most official histories are dry and dusty affairs. Not this one. The introduction, for instance, plunges straight into the history of the town, recording that seven martyrs had been burnt at the stake in different parts of the town, adding: \"For what? Freedom of speech?\" Even while these events were taking place, golf was a part of St Andrews. It reveals that those supposedly haphazard bunkers on the Old Course were charted \"with all the care exercised in indicating sand-banks and sunk rocks in a mariners chart\" as early as 1842, and also tells the full and fascinating story of the demise through drink of the brilliant talent that was Young Tom Morris. The book takes us, compellingly, through the championships right up to 1995, and if it is not on hand in Tiger's house, it should be. Yours too. David Davies It's not about the bike Lance Armstrong (Yellow Jersey, \u00a317) It is said that Lance Armstrong's transformation from testicular cancer patient to Tour de France winner is to be made into a film. But it is hard to see any movie doing justice to the script provided by Armstrong's own account, co-authored by Sally Jenkins and winner of this year's William Hill sports book of the year award. Having nearly lost his life, Armstrong has no qualms about serving it up on a plate for the rest of the world to wonder at, shudder at and learn from. Armstrong's attitude to his cancer is quasi-religious - \"the most important and shaping event in my life\" - but the account of his diagnosis and treatment is almost too down-to-earth. \"My testicle was horrendously swollen, almost to the size of an orange... Chemo was a continuous cough, hacking up chunks of mysterious, tar-like matter from deep in my chest.\" As the title implies, the pleasure and pain of cycling are on a different level altogether. William Fotheringham Full Time Tony Cascarino with Paul Kimmage (Simon and Schuster, \u00a39.99) Compared with the standard-issue footballer's autobiography, this is Tolstoy. Football commentators have been quick to trumpet its honesty, its depth, its suggestion that there might, after all, be intelligent life out there. Its pleasures lie in what it has to say rather than in the quality of the prose. But what it says is astonishing. Because, in a world of obfuscation, cliche and false modesty, Tony Cascarino has been honest. The most compelling truth he admits to is a sense of personal inadequacy. Footballers are obliged to exude self-confidence. Cascarino's doubts, though, are huge. He and Kimmage communicate this by inventing an alter ego who sits on the player's shoulder and offers debilitating analysis of his performance. Drawing the link between Cascarino's gremlin and his father, a man whose guidance was restricted to the sneer and put-down, may be superficial analysis, but there are few football books that even allow us that luxury.

      "byline": "Rebecca Allison",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The gnawing fear in the pit of her stomach was so overwhelming it made her gasp for breath as soon as the school bell rang to signal home time. </p> <p>For seven-year-old Molly this was the terrifying hour of reckoning she faced daily, when she would discover whether her mother had survived without her. </p> <p>\"I didn't cope much at school. I didn't use to get on with my work. I used to daydream all the time about what sort of stuff my dad could be doing to my mum. I was frightened, thinking that he could be beating her and hitting her with stuff right now. I was afraid he could kill her.\" </p> <p>Sitting in her bedroom four years later, at the women's refuge she and her mother now call home, Molly describes the torment she silently endured as a child witnessing domestic violence. </p> <p>The dread would usually subside when she saw the familiar blue coat hovering near the school gates but as she crossed the playground Molly would try to gauge just how bad the damage had been that day. </p> <p>\"When my dad stabbed my mum with a fork and when he used to punch her a lot, the next day her face would be all swollen, and when we came to the refuge he'd punched her in the eye and she couldn't see properly. That's why she couldn't put her lenses in because it was all big and she had to wear sunglasses and a hat,\" she murmured. </p> <p>Molly and her mother Claire arrived at one of Refuge's safe houses a year ago, after fleeing in the middle of the night with few belongings and little money. </p> <p>With the national charity's help they have built a new life free from abuse and fear, but the emotional scars they bear are not so easy to erase. </p> <p>Molly, now 11, is among hundreds of thousands of children in Britain who have experienced their father or step- father stabbing, beating, burning, raping or threatening their mother. </p> <p>Recent figures have shown one in four women will be physically abused by a partner or ex-partner and in nine out of 10 cases of domestic violence, children are in the same or an adjacent room. </p> <p>Seeing or hearing a life- threatening assault can cause intense fear in a child. </p> <p>\"It made me feel frightened, scared and angry when I used to see mum cry and when I saw her blood and my dad hitting her with weapons and hitting her with his hands. The worst thing was when my dad hit my mum with a gun,\" Molly said. </p> <p>In some cases the psychological damage such experiences can cause is long lasting and may lead to post-traumatic stress disorder. </p> <p>The establishment of a unique children's service at Refuge has begun to address this problem and help children to overcome the trauma of what they have experienced at home. </p> <p>Since 1995 the refuge-based programme, headed by an educational psychologist, Ruth Aitken, has focused on the psychological effects of violence on children and finding the best means of help and support for each individual. This is the first time child psychologists have worked in refuges anywhere in the world. </p> <p>Many children like Molly suppress their own feelings and are fearful of telling anyone what is happening. </p> <p>Refuge's research has found that children react in different ways to their experiences with some presenting an image of coping well and others displaying a range of emotions from anger, irritability, panic and regression to withdrawal, depression, underachievement, self-blame and guilt. </p> <p>Most children entering the programme, which costs \u00a3360,000 a year to run, feel hopeless and sad. Many believe they will never be free of violence and fear. Others are so traumatised that they can only talk about their experiences in the third person. </p> <p>The children are offered the opportunity to reflect on and make sense of what has happened to them in a safe environ-ment with psychologists and play workers in individual and group settings. </p> <p>The project also provides nursery care and after school clubs as well as pioneering research into the little known effects of violence on pre-school children. The charity aims to provide the specialist service to every child who is living in a refuge but an acute shortage of funds prevents this from becoming a reality. </p> <p>As Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, pointed out: \"The support we provide is just the beginning.

      "bodyText": "The gnawing fear in the pit of her stomach was so overwhelming it made her gasp for breath as soon as the school bell rang to signal home time. For seven-year-old Molly this was the terrifying hour of reckoning she faced daily, when she would discover whether her mother had survived without her. \"I didn't cope much at school. I didn't use to get on with my work. I used to daydream all the time about what sort of stuff my dad could be doing to my mum. I was frightened, thinking that he could be beating her and hitting her with stuff right now. I was afraid he could kill her.\" Sitting in her bedroom four years later, at the women's refuge she and her mother now call home, Molly describes the torment she silently endured as a child witnessing domestic violence. The dread would usually subside when she saw the familiar blue coat hovering near the school gates but as she crossed the playground Molly would try to gauge just how bad the damage had been that day. \"When my dad stabbed my mum with a fork and when he used to punch her a lot, the next day her face would be all swollen, and when we came to the refuge he'd punched her in the eye and she couldn't see properly. That's why she couldn't put her lenses in because it was all big and she had to wear sunglasses and a hat,\" she murmured. Molly and her mother Claire arrived at one of Refuge's safe houses a year ago, after fleeing in the middle of the night with few belongings and little money. With the national charity's help they have built a new life free from abuse and fear, but the emotional scars they bear are not so easy to erase. Molly, now 11, is among hundreds of thousands of children in Britain who have experienced their father or step- father stabbing, beating, burning, raping or threatening their mother. Recent figures have shown one in four women will be physically abused by a partner or ex-partner and in nine out of 10 cases of domestic violence, children are in the same or an adjacent room. Seeing or hearing a life- threatening assault can cause intense fear in a child. \"It made me feel frightened, scared and angry when I used to see mum cry and when I saw her blood and my dad hitting her with weapons and hitting her with his hands. The worst thing was when my dad hit my mum with a gun,\" Molly said. In some cases the psychological damage such experiences can cause is long lasting and may lead to post-traumatic stress disorder. The establishment of a unique children's service at Refuge has begun to address this problem and help children to overcome the trauma of what they have experienced at home. Since 1995 the refuge-based programme, headed by an educational psychologist, Ruth Aitken, has focused on the psychological effects of violence on children and finding the best means of help and support for each individual. This is the first time child psychologists have worked in refuges anywhere in the world. Many children like Molly suppress their own feelings and are fearful of telling anyone what is happening. Refuge's research has found that children react in different ways to their experiences with some presenting an image of coping well and others displaying a range of emotions from anger, irritability, panic and regression to withdrawal, depression, underachievement, self-blame and guilt. Most children entering the programme, which costs \u00a3360,000 a year to run, feel hopeless and sad. Many believe they will never be free of violence and fear. Others are so traumatised that they can only talk about their experiences in the third person. The children are offered the opportunity to reflect on and make sense of what has happened to them in a safe environ-ment with psychologists and play workers in individual and group settings. The project also provides nursery care and after school clubs as well as pioneering research into the little known effects of violence on pre-school children. The charity aims to provide the specialist service to every child who is living in a refuge but an acute shortage of funds prevents this from becoming a reality. As Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, pointed out: \"The support we provide is just the beginning. Our services are crucial for the children in our refuges but if we really want to make a difference we have to reach more of them. We also have to get into the school, educate children and emphasise that violent behaviour is not acceptable.\" Molly no longer daydreams at school. She was one of the luckier ones. The nightmares and panic attacks she frequently suffered a year ago no longer haunt her. It is a slow process but, with the help of the children's service, she is gradually beginning to believe that the past is firmly left behind. \"I used to dream my dad was chasing me and my mum down the road. He wanted to kill her. He had a gun, he shot her in the belly and then he turned round and looked at me in a bad way, in an angry and horrible way. \"I'm not frightened any more and the nightmares have stopped.

      "body": "<p>Fayemi was slumped in the back of the car. She had injected herself with a shot of heroin shortly before we met last week and was just finishing smoking a rock of crack-cocaine to get a fresh high. She had not eaten for two days, but she did not care. </p> <p>Fayemi is 14. She has already seen and done things that no one should ever have to experience. She has wide, dark eyes and childishly translucent skin. But the life she has been forced to lead has aged her, causing wrinkles round her eyes more often found in a much older woman. </p> <p>Six months ago, Fayemi's father sold her to two men who visited their village in Nigeria. She saw the men speak to her father and hand him money, but she had no idea what it was about until she was bundled into a car. </p> <p>When they reached Lagos airport, Fayemi was handed to a woman who already had two other girls trailing behind her. The woman gave the three girls sweets and fizzy drinks - and they were waved through immigration. Fayemi slept throughthe flight: 'I was tired,' she says in halting English. 'My eyes were closed all the time.' </p> <p>At Gatwick, the group was met by two men. Dazed and drained, Fayemi didn't resist when one of them took her away. She had never been out of her village and in this strange and terrifying new world, she had no choice but to stick close to the only adult who seemed to care what happened to her. </p> <p>The man took her to a flat in London. There were five other girls. The oldest was about 18; the youngest, Maria, was just six. 'She came from Nigeria like me,' Fayemi said. 'But the others came from far away. I could not understand their words.' </p> <p>Men came to the flat every day. 'From early, early and then late also. They were smart. They wore suits. They hurt me.' Sometimes Fayemi was taken to their offices and sometimes they came to the flat. She was never left alone and any money she was given by the men who came to have sex with her was immediately taken away. </p> <p>She hated her new life. She protested and the men who ran the brothel gave her some heroin and showed her how to inject it. It was her first introduction to drugs. 'It made it hurt more little,' she said, twisting her matted hair tightly between delicate fingers. </p> <p>Two weeks ago, Fayemi climbed out of the window of the flat and ran away. She now spends between 10pm to 6am every day walking the streets of East London, dressed in the long fake fur coat and pink trousers given to her when she reached England. </p> <p>She wants the cars to stop because she needs the money but every time someone slows down, she is terrified. 'The men said they would kill me if I left. It true.' She started to cry. Tomorrow, she said, she would go further away; a girl she met suggested Nottingham or perhaps Croydon. She's not sure where they are. Someone else suggested somewhere called 'Scomland'. </p> <p>The trafficking of children into Britain for the purposes of sexual slavery was virtually unheard of four years ago. Many organisations refuse to accept that it is happening: 'There's no evidence at all that foreign girls are being bought into this country and set to work as prostitutes,' said Jane Ayres, director of the Praed Street Project in Charing Cross, a highly respected, government-funded body. But an Observer investigation has uncovered incontrovertible evidence that foreign girls as young as 11 are being trafficked to work as prostitutes in flats around London. </p> <p>These girls are not only victims of sexual exploitation, but are here illegally and under the age of consent. Every caution is taken by their pimps to escape detection: the children's services are not advertised, they never work outdoors and, although they sometimes visit punters in their homes or offices, they are accompanied by their jailers from the moment they leave the flat to the minute they return. </p> <p>The Observer has found a small number of children who have escaped their masters working on the streets of South and East London. All are too terrified of authority and of adults to ask for help, believing that whatever terrible treatment they have suffered, the Government and police will do little to help them. </p> <p>These girls eke out lives of terrible danger: unless they can persuade another brothel to take them in - a highly unlikely option, given their illegal age and status in the country - they must walk the streets in a city whose language they cannot speak and whose mores are alien to them. </p> <p>'There are three girls on the block here who are obviously underage and barely speak English,' said Gemma, who has been working as a prostitute since her mother stood her on a street corner at the age of 11. 'We're all at risk but they're in serious danger. They don't understand what they're agreeing to and they don't see the signs that we do: I can see violent men a mile off because I understand the signs. They don't understand anything - they do eventually but it's a hard and nasty learning curve.' </p> <p>The swollen weal left across one of Chanel's high cheekbones had turned her finely boned face into a pathetically lopsided mask. She will be 16 in February. When she was 13, her desperately ill mother sent her to live with her 28-year-old brother in a small African village she refuses to name. </p> <p>Within months, her brother had bought two false passports and two tickets to England. 'I wore different hair and different clothes,' she said, twisting in her seat and shredding the cigarette packet in front of her. Her attention was starting to fail: it had been a couple of hours since she smoked her last rock of crack-cocaine and her friend hasn't returned yet with the fresh supply she was sent to buy. </p> <p>Chanel's brother set up her in a flat in London with other four girls. 'No English girls,' she said. 'There was a Romanian girl with a baby. She was young like me but the men came to look at the baby without any clothes. I don't think they touched it; they just watched.' </p> <p>None of the other girls spoke French and, like Fayemi, Chanel was kept prisoner in the flat. She tried to save money to get home but her brother took everything she earned. The only time she managed to save a few pounds, her brother beat her so badly she was bruised from her lower thigh to her shoulder. He didn't hit her face, though; that came courtesy of a recent customer. </p> <p>Six months ago, she ran away. After drifting around the city in terror, she turned up in Brixton. Her days now start at 11pm with a visit to the crack house on the corner of Brixton Hill and end at around 6am, after the morning rush of businessmen has ended. </p> <p>Her brother, furious to be deprived of his easy income, tracked his sister down and set fire to her flat at a time when she should have been asleep inside. The heat of the fire was so intense that the windows exploded but Chanel had gone out earlier. </p> <p>The fire destroyed her few possessions. And now she is homeless. In the past week she has slept outside in the bitter cold or in the house of punters, one of whom raped her while she was sleeping. </p> <p>'My mother doesn't know where I am. I haven't seen her for two years,' she said. 'It's Christmas soon and I want to go home but I am in too much trouble.' Her brother has successfully instilled a terror of authority: she couldn't even bring herself to tell the police when he tried to burnt her flat to the ground as she slept inside it. 'No police. No,' she insisted, 'I'm scared of them. I'm in big trouble with them.' </p> <p>Traditionally, underage victims of sexual exploitation have circumvented Britain entirely, with routes starting in Africa, Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, and Latin America and ending in Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin and Italy. </p> <p>Britain has only entered the picture as a staging post: there is a long history of Irish children breaking their journey in London before going on to Belgium and a more recent trend in Britain being used as a staging post to smuggle Nigerian girls across to Italy, but there has never been any suggestion that the girls were put to work in this country. Detective Inspector Paul Holmes, of Scotland Yard's clubs and vice unit, the only pro-active organisation in the country targeting prostitution, has admitted he is horrified by the result of The Observer 's investigation. 'The problem of girls being trafficked for sexual purposes is a major one but this is worse than anything we have encountered so far,' he said. </p> <p>'This is the first intelligence we have had that we have a problem in relation to young girls rather than girls in their late teens, and we can't even prove that those girls, who are mostly Albanian girls hidden in Soho flats, are underage because they're almost impossible to find and have false ID,' he added. </p> <p>The issue is so new that experts admit it is impossible to know what started the trend. They suggest the strength of sterling, the widening global gap between rich and poor, and point out the fact that even though our ports and airports have tightened up their immigration controls, Eurostar offers an easy route in. Others point to the fact that while under the current law, traffickers risk nothing more than a fine or, at worst, less than two years' imprisonment, drug traffickers risk at least 10 years. Set this against the enormous profit traffickers of women and children are already making - an estimated $7 billion in 1998 - and it seems more pertinent to ask why didn't this happen earlier? </p> <p>Nicola Mullenger, a worker for Mainliners, a drug outreach project funded by Lambeth, South wark and Lewisham councils, compares the trend to the entry of Coca-cola into Eastern Europe after the wall came down in 1989. 'It's completely unexploited territory here,' she said. 'Britain is a gift to them.' </p> <p>Professor David Barrett, the country's leading expert on child prostitution, believes numbers of child victims of trafficking have been increasing at the rate of 15 per cent each year for the last three years. He predicts an explosive rise unless action is taken. </p> <p>'There are probably around 1,600 women trafficked into Britain each year and so to maintain that we're just a staging post when children are concerned is bordering on the foolishly naive. Race and youth both have price premiums in this country just as in any other. You have to imagine the lives some of these girls have been leading: they've lived in gut-wrenching poverty in war-torn countries with not the slightest hope of escape,' Barrett said. </p> <p>'Once their self-esteem has been completely destroyed and they have dulled their response to the abuse of prostitution, life in a rich, western world can offer them some advantages over the family that betrayed them and to whom they can never return now anyway.' </p> <p>Doodle, one of the many dealers in Brixton who sell drugs to the local girls - who will visit him up to 20 times a night, spending their money as they earn it - said: 'I've seen a massive rise in the number of young, foreign girls coming to my flat in the last 18 months. The girls come here after escaping from whatever flat they've been trapped in by the traffickers. They might not like this life at first but after a while they begin to enjoy it. It's a new and fascinating world to them: \u00a310 is \u00a31,000 to them - they think they're in heaven.' </p> <p>DI Holmes believes that now the trafficking has started, it is only a matter of time before the number of child prostitutes outstrips demand. 'Once that happens, there is no reason we will not see extreme levels of violence seen elsewhere in Europe,' he said. 'We think the lack of competition is the only reason the shooting has not started yet.' </p> <p><strong>Gemma's story</strong><br> ''When I was 11, I was walking down the street outside my house in Nottingham when these men passed and said things to me that I didn't understand. When I got home, I asked my mother what they'd meant. I started working the streets soon after that. 'I had my first son when I was 14 but the father was deported to Jamaica; I haven't seen him since. I've got three sons now. They live with my dad in Nottingham. I haven't seen them for two years. 'I love them, I really do, but I don't want them to see me like this. I know they're being looked after where they are and when I sort myself out, I'll be a proper mother to them. I spoke to my dad for the first time in two years yesterday and he said he would pick me up on Monday and take me to stay with him and his new girlfriend in Nottingham, My family's rich: we've got horses. I'm trained as an amateur jockey. When I sort myself out, I could tech show jumping and stuff. In 1996, I got 6 months for blackmailing more than 30 punters. I filmed them having sex with me and then threatened to tell. I asked them for more than \u00a33,000 each. It's a shame it didn't work - I hate punters: they're all bastards.'</p>",

They don't understand anything - they do eventually but it's a hard and nasty learning curve.' The swollen weal left across one of Chanel's high cheekbones had turned her finely boned face into a pathetically lopsided mask. She will be 16 in February. When she was 13, her desperately ill mother sent her to live with her 28-year-old brother in a small African village she refuses to name. Within months, her brother had bought two false passports and two tickets to England. 'I wore different hair and different clothes,' she said, twisting in her seat and shredding the cigarette packet in front of her. Her attention was starting to fail: it had been a couple of hours since she smoked her last rock of crack-cocaine and her friend hasn't returned yet with the fresh supply she was sent to buy. Chanel's brother set up her in a flat in London with other four girls. 'No English girls,' she said. 'There was a Romanian girl with a baby. She was young like me but the men came to look at the baby without any clothes. I don't think they touched it; they just watched.' None of the other girls spoke French and, like Fayemi, Chanel was kept prisoner in the flat. She tried to save money to get home but her brother took everything she earned. The only time she managed to save a few pounds, her brother beat her so badly she was bruised from her lower thigh to her shoulder. He didn't hit her face, though; that came courtesy of a recent customer. Six months ago, she ran away. After drifting around the city in terror, she turned up in Brixton. Her days now start at 11pm with a visit to the crack house on the corner of Brixton Hill and end at around 6am, after the morning rush of businessmen has ended. Her brother, furious to be deprived of his easy income, tracked his sister down and set fire to her flat at a time when she should have been asleep inside. The heat of the fire was so intense that the windows exploded but Chanel had gone out earlier. The fire destroyed her few possessions. And now she is homeless. In the past week she has slept outside in the bitter cold or in the house of punters, one of whom raped her while she was sleeping. 'My mother doesn't know where I am. I haven't seen her for two years,' she said. 'It's Christmas soon and I want to go home but I am in too much trouble.' Her brother has successfully instilled a terror of authority: she couldn't even bring herself to tell the police when he tried to burnt her flat to the ground as she slept inside it. 'No police. No,' she insisted, 'I'm scared of them. I'm in big trouble with them.' Traditionally, underage victims of sexual exploitation have circumvented Britain entirely, with routes starting in Africa, Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, and Latin America and ending in Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin and Italy. Britain has only entered the picture as a staging post: there is a long history of Irish children breaking their journey in London before going on to Belgium and a more recent trend in Britain being used as a staging post to smuggle Nigerian girls across to Italy, but there has never been any suggestion that the girls were put to work in this country. Detective Inspector Paul Holmes, of Scotland Yard's clubs and vice unit, the only pro-active organisation in the country targeting prostitution, has admitted he is horrified by the result of The Observer 's investigation. 'The problem of girls being trafficked for sexual purposes is a major one but this is worse than anything we have encountered so far,' he said. 'This is the first intelligence we have had that we have a problem in relation to young girls rather than girls in their late teens, and we can't even prove that those girls, who are mostly Albanian girls hidden in Soho flats, are underage because they're almost impossible to find and have false ID,' he added. The issue is so new that experts admit it is impossible to know what started the trend. They suggest the strength of sterling, the widening global gap between rich and poor, and point out the fact that even though our ports and airports have tightened up their immigration controls, Eurostar offers an easy route in. Others point to the fact that while under the current law, traffickers risk nothing more than a fine or, at worst, less than two years' imprisonment, drug traffickers risk at least 10 years. Set this against the enormous profit traffickers of women and children are already making - an estimated $7 billion in 1998 - and it seems more pertinent to ask why didn't this happen earlier? Nicola Mullenger, a worker for Mainliners, a drug outreach project funded by Lambeth, South wark and Lewisham councils, compares the trend to the entry of Coca-cola into Eastern Europe after the wall came down in 1989. 'It's completely unexploited territory here,' she said. 'Britain is a gift to them.' Professor David Barrett, the country's leading expert on child prostitution, believes numbers of child victims of trafficking have been increasing at the rate of 15 per cent each year for the last three years. He predicts an explosive rise unless action is taken. 'There are probably around 1,600 women trafficked into Britain each year and so to maintain that we're just a staging post when children are concerned is bordering on the foolishly naive. Race and youth both have price premiums in this country just as in any other. You have to imagine the lives some of these girls have been leading: they've lived in gut-wrenching poverty in war-torn countries with not the slightest hope of escape,' Barrett said. 'Once their self-esteem has been completely destroyed and they have dulled their response to the abuse of prostitution, life in a rich, western world can offer them some advantages over the family that betrayed them and to whom they can never return now anyway.' Doodle, one of the many dealers in Brixton who sell drugs to the local girls - who will visit him up to 20 times a night, spending their money as they earn it - said: 'I've seen a massive rise in the number of young, foreign girls coming to my flat in the last 18 months. The girls come here after escaping from whatever flat they've been trapped in by the traffickers. They might not like this life at first but after a while they begin to enjoy it. It's a new and fascinating world to them: \u00a310 is \u00a31,000 to them - they think they're in heaven.' DI Holmes believes that now the trafficking has started, it is only a matter of time before the number of child prostitutes outstrips demand. 'Once that happens, there is no reason we will not see extreme levels of violence seen elsewhere in Europe,' he said. 'We think the lack of competition is the only reason the shooting has not started yet.' Gemma's story ''When I was 11, I was walking down the street outside my house in Nottingham when these men passed and said things to me that I didn't understand. When I got home, I asked my mother what they'd meant. I started working the streets soon after that. 'I had my first son when I was 14 but the father was deported to Jamaica; I haven't seen him since. I've got three sons now. They live with my dad in Nottingham. I haven't seen them for two years. 'I love them, I really do, but I don't want them to see me like this. I know they're being looked after where they are and when I sort myself out, I'll be a proper mother to them. I spoke to my dad for the first time in two years yesterday and he said he would pick me up on Monday and take me to stay with him and his new girlfriend in Nottingham, My family's rich: we've got horses. I'm trained as an amateur jockey. When I sort myself out, I could tech show jumping and stuff. In 1996, I got 6 months for blackmailing more than 30 punters. I filmed them having sex with me and then threatened to tell. I asked them for more than \u00a33,000 each. It's a shame it didn't work - I hate punters: they're all bastards.'",

      "trailText": "<p><strong>Analysis: </strong>Continental Europe will still be streets ahead of us on rights for new parents even if the government's proposals are implemented in full, writes <strong> Nick Burkitt </strong></p>",
      "byline": "Nick Burkitt",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Even if the options for making life easier for working parents contained in the government's recent green paper were all taken up, parents in the United Kingdom would still receive less help and protection at work than those in almost every other country in Europe. When it comes to maternity rights, parental leave and pay while taking time off to look after children, this country is and will remain a long way behind its neighbours. </p> <p>The trade secretary, Stephen Byers, is proposing modest changes to existing rights - things like extending the right to unpaid maternity leave to a year, or increasing the flat rate of statutory maternity pay, now \u00a360.20 per week. There are also limited rights to work reduced hours, for either or both parents, after having a child. These are balanced by ideas to help make the law and the administration of maternity pay simpler for employers and the possibility of exemptions for some small businesses. </p> <p>But Labour has made quite clear that not all of the proposals will be implemented. Employers, employees and other interested groups are invited to indicate their top three priorities on a list (they have until March to respond). </p> <p>To put the proposals in perspective, Sweden offers 450 days of paid leave per family, which can be taken all at once or used to reduce working hours. Norway offers 52 weeks of full-time leave, paid at 80% of earnings. Germany, France and Spain offer full-time leave for new parents until their child is three years old, which in the first two countries can also be used to work part-time. Belgium has three months full-time or six months part-time leave, backed by a career-breaks scheme of up to six years. </p> <p>The UK was the last country in the European Union to introduce parental leave, 15 years after a draft EC directive was first proposed, and 25 years after Sweden. Even the US was quicker, with the Family and Medical Leave Act in 1993. Only five other EU members offer no form of payment for people taking family leave. All of them offer earnings-related maternity pay for longer than the six weeks given in the UK. Most of them also have well-established rights for men and women to work reduced or flexible hours after having a baby. This has been fiercely resisted here so far by employers. </p> <p>The proposal that got the most media attention was that men should be offered the right to two weeks' paternity leave, possibly paid at the \u00a360.20 per week rate. The recognition that caring for children is not just the mother's responsibility, and that men might need financial help from the government to be able to take a bigger caring role, is significant. Certainly all the evidence from elsewhere in Europe is that entitlements to leave are not taken by men in any numbers unless it is paid and paid at a high enough rate to replace earnings from work. </p> <p>The big question is why the state should get involved. Coming from the Department of Trade and Industry, the green paper focused mainly on productivity and the \"business case\" for changing the law. Parents, especially women, need help to balance work and family care because otherwise they and their skills will be lost to employers and the economy - either because they have to give up work or because they work less efficiently. Refreshingly, the green paper does offer as one of its goals \"safeguarding the health and welfare of the mother and child before and after birth\". The wellbeing of children or elderly dependants of working people often gets lost in today's debate over work-life balance and family-friendly employment. \"Burdens on business\" usually get more attention. </p> <p>The state will get involved because having a child is more than a lifestyle choice: it is something special that deserves help and support from employers and the rest of society. But should businesses carry the costs of losing staff? Should childless workers work harder to cover for them? Many people probably think that the answer to both questions is \"no\". </p> <p>Over to government. If its job is to improve the welfare of all its citizens through time, then even where a new regulation might not be in the interests of particular businesses, it is still the right thing to do. The choice over exactly how much public help should be offered parents is a political one, resting on a belief that parents' interests should be given priority, with a claim on taxpayers. </p> <p>The ways in which other European countries provide rights and financial help to families and working parents vary enormously. Differences do not just come from detailed calculations of cost or labour market structures. They reflect different cultural attitudes to the family, to the roles of men and women, to childcare and to how far the state should be involved. France has a long history of trying to encourage more childbirth, so it pays benefits only for second and subsequent children. Germany has traditionally aimed to support the male-breadwinner family and so made it easier for women not to work. The Scandinavian countries have had a long-lasting commitment to sex equality and helping both parents to work. </p> <p>Finland is proposing to raise its paid paternity leave from 18 to 42 days, within a week of a British proposal to raise it from nothing to two weeks. This is not because the Finns can afford it more than the British. It is a priority for them, so they choose collectively to spend their money that way. </p> <p>\u0095 Nick Burkitt researches the future of work at the Institute for Public Policy Research.</p>",

These are balanced by ideas to help make the law and the administration of maternity pay simpler for employers and the possibility of exemptions for some small businesses. But Labour has made quite clear that not all of the proposals will be implemented. Employers, employees and other interested groups are invited to indicate their top three priorities on a list (they have until March to respond). To put the proposals in perspective, Sweden offers 450 days of paid leave per family, which can be taken all at once or used to reduce working hours. Norway offers 52 weeks of full-time leave, paid at 80% of earnings. Germany, France and Spain offer full-time leave for new parents until their child is three years old, which in the first two countries can also be used to work part-time. Belgium has three months full-time or six months part-time leave, backed by a career-breaks scheme of up to six years. The UK was the last country in the European Union to introduce parental leave, 15 years after a draft EC directive was first proposed, and 25 years after Sweden. Even the US was quicker, with the Family and Medical Leave Act in 1993. Only five other EU members offer no form of payment for people taking family leave. All of them offer earnings-related maternity pay for longer than the six weeks given in the UK. Most of them also have well-established rights for men and women to work reduced or flexible hours after having a baby. This has been fiercely resisted here so far by employers. The proposal that got the most media attention was that men should be offered the right to two weeks' paternity leave, possibly paid at the \u00a360.20 per week rate. The recognition that caring for children is not just the mother's responsibility, and that men might need financial help from the government to be able to take a bigger caring role, is significant. Certainly all the evidence from elsewhere in Europe is that entitlements to leave are not taken by men in any numbers unless it is paid and paid at a high enough rate to replace earnings from work. The big question is why the state should get involved. Coming from the Department of Trade and Industry, the green paper focused mainly on productivity and the \"business case\" for changing the law. Parents, especially women, need help to balance work and family care because otherwise they and their skills will be lost to employers and the economy - either because they have to give up work or because they work less efficiently. Refreshingly, the green paper does offer as one of its goals \"safeguarding the health and welfare of the mother and child before and after birth\". The wellbeing of children or elderly dependants of working people often gets lost in today's debate over work-life balance and family-friendly employment. \"Burdens on business\" usually get more attention. The state will get involved because having a child is more than a lifestyle choice: it is something special that deserves help and support from employers and the rest of society. But should businesses carry the costs of losing staff? Should childless workers work harder to cover for them? Many people probably think that the answer to both questions is \"no\". Over to government. If its job is to improve the welfare of all its citizens through time, then even where a new regulation might not be in the interests of particular businesses, it is still the right thing to do. The choice over exactly how much public help should be offered parents is a political one, resting on a belief that parents' interests should be given priority, with a claim on taxpayers. The ways in which other European countries provide rights and financial help to families and working parents vary enormously. Differences do not just come from detailed calculations of cost or labour market structures. They reflect different cultural attitudes to the family, to the roles of men and women, to childcare and to how far the state should be involved. France has a long history of trying to encourage more childbirth, so it pays benefits only for second and subsequent children. Germany has traditionally aimed to support the male-breadwinner family and so made it easier for women not to work. The Scandinavian countries have had a long-lasting commitment to sex equality and helping both parents to work. Finland is proposing to raise its paid paternity leave from 18 to 42 days, within a week of a British proposal to raise it from nothing to two weeks. This is not because the Finns can afford it more than the British. It is a priority for them, so they choose collectively to spend their money that way. \u0095 Nick Burkitt researches the future of work at the Institute for Public Policy Research.",

      "body": "<p>If you happened to live in the Chatham Islands off the coast of New Zealand (and not many people do), you would have been treated to an extraordinary advertising event at the beginning of this year. </p> <p>The first inhabited land mass to see the dawning of the new millennium was subjected to a syrupy 90-second commercial for global ad agency Euro RSCG, complete with stock footage of the first man on the moon to the stirring strains of Judy Garland warbling Somewhere Over the Rainbow. </p> <p>The ad, created in the UK, aired just after midnight on New Year's Day and closed with the words: \"The future belongs to those who dare to be first - you have been watching the very first commercial of the millennium.\" </p> <p>This stomach-churning agency indulgence kicked off a year that was, otherwise, rather disappointingly un-millennial for adfolk and adland. There were several creative highlights, most definitely, but nothing apocalyptic or significantly fin de si\u00e8cle or mould-breaking. </p> <p>That is, except for \"Whassup!\". </p> <p>Unleashed on the British public on September 13, this DDB Chicago commercial for Budweiser consisted simply of a bunch of American blokes screeching \"Whassup!\" to one another down the phone. It was unarguably the biggest ad of the year. </p> <p>Not only did it clinch the top prize at Cannes, the most prestigious international awards festival, its catchphrase also bushfired across the nation and snuck into everyone's vocabulary. Footballers adopted it as a particularly brainless yell of triumph when they scored, newspaper cartoonists exploited it, Budweiser's switchboard was regularly jammed with jokers phoning in to scream \"Whassup!\" down the line and even Homer Simpson, bless him, aped it in an episode of The Simpsons. </p> <p>But other ads did make their mark on the year - some might say rather more deservedly. </p> <p>Not least of these was the gorgeous \"ideal woman\" 40-seconder for Lynx deodorant by Bartle Bogle Hegarty, featuring a parade of females uttering words that men can only dream of hearing. Thus a stunning brunette purred: \"Oh no, if I'd wanted foreplay I would have asked for it,\" as another, similarly succumbing to \"the Lynx effect\", cooed: \"Oh, you look soooo sexy playing air guitar.\" </p> <p>Barclays Bank also scored a surprising hit with a handful of blockbusters featuring a big theme, big names and directed by one of the biggest directors, Tony Scott. The films depicted various stars, including Sir Anthony Hopkins, musing on the theme of \"bigness\" to fit with the new Barclays endline \"A big world needs a big bank\". Unfortunately the campaign couldn't have been timed worse: it coincided perfectly with the shutting down of several rural branches. Lots of negative PR ensued, therefore, but they were great ads nevertheless. </p> <p>Leo Burnett continued to produce entertaining stuff for McDonald's - this year, proving that 10 seconds can indeed be a creative time-frame. It came up with several spots in which we glimpsed a plumber tut-tutting at a leaking kitchen pipe, a removals man bashing a piano into a wall, and an estate agent opening and shutting a door to \"the lounge\" - all working for as long as it takes to earn the necessary 99p for a quarter pounder. </p> <p>BMP DDB also unveiled more classy work for VW, with a brilliantly-executed hymn to motoring for its Polo marque featuring a motorist delighting in various road blockages that mean he can stay in his Polo for longer. </p> <p>Aside from \"Whassup!\", 2000 was also the year of the spoof. Several ads gloriously satirised TV programmes and movies, one of the best being by Lowe Lintas for Weetabix, which borrowed heavily from the 70s TV show Black Beauty, using its opening sequence and familiar theme-tune (and tweaking the ending by having two exhausted, Weetabix-fuelled blokes climb out of a pantomime horse). WCRS similarly spoofed the wildlife epic Born Free in an ad for Land Rover's new Freelander, complete with pukka Zulu voiceover and stunning footage of the African plains. </p> <p>In September, another interesting trend emerged: stealth advertising. This was the term given to ads that were increasingly ditching any form of overt branding or product shots in favour of more minimal communication. Adidas' sponsorship of the Olympic Games exemplified the new style, starring Lee Evans in a series of hilarious films learning how to take part in various sports. These carried no evident branding and even ran as programming on the BBC. </p> <p>But 2000 did, of course, produce its fair share of stinkers. The sight of comedian Harry Hill in the excruciating tactical One2One commercial was anything but comic - just how many times can you recite a phone number in 30 seconds Harry? - and even BMP gaffed with its commercial for British Gas's new telephone service in which an irritating bloke comes home and starts warming his backside on a phone (er, hello?). </p> <p>Then there was Pringles, plumbing new depths with a spot for its pizza-flavoured variety that, apparently, get people dancing uncontrollably in the streets.

      "bodyText": "If you happened to live in the Chatham Islands off the coast of New Zealand (and not many people do), you would have been treated to an extraordinary advertising event at the beginning of this year. The first inhabited land mass to see the dawning of the new millennium was subjected to a syrupy 90-second commercial for global ad agency Euro RSCG, complete with stock footage of the first man on the moon to the stirring strains of Judy Garland warbling Somewhere Over the Rainbow. The ad, created in the UK, aired just after midnight on New Year's Day and closed with the words: \"The future belongs to those who dare to be first - you have been watching the very first commercial of the millennium.\" This stomach-churning agency indulgence kicked off a year that was, otherwise, rather disappointingly un-millennial for adfolk and adland. There were several creative highlights, most definitely, but nothing apocalyptic or significantly fin de si\u00e8cle or mould-breaking. That is, except for \"Whassup!\". Unleashed on the British public on September 13, this DDB Chicago commercial for Budweiser consisted simply of a bunch of American blokes screeching \"Whassup!\" to one another down the phone. It was unarguably the biggest ad of the year. Not only did it clinch the top prize at Cannes, the most prestigious international awards festival, its catchphrase also bushfired across the nation and snuck into everyone's vocabulary. Footballers adopted it as a particularly brainless yell of triumph when they scored, newspaper cartoonists exploited it, Budweiser's switchboard was regularly jammed with jokers phoning in to scream \"Whassup!\" down the line and even Homer Simpson, bless him, aped it in an episode of The Simpsons. But other ads did make their mark on the year - some might say rather more deservedly. Not least of these was the gorgeous \"ideal woman\" 40-seconder for Lynx deodorant by Bartle Bogle Hegarty, featuring a parade of females uttering words that men can only dream of hearing. Thus a stunning brunette purred: \"Oh no, if I'd wanted foreplay I would have asked for it,\" as another, similarly succumbing to \"the Lynx effect\", cooed: \"Oh, you look soooo sexy playing air guitar.\" Barclays Bank also scored a surprising hit with a handful of blockbusters featuring a big theme, big names and directed by one of the biggest directors, Tony Scott. The films depicted various stars, including Sir Anthony Hopkins, musing on the theme of \"bigness\" to fit with the new Barclays endline \"A big world needs a big bank\". Unfortunately the campaign couldn't have been timed worse: it coincided perfectly with the shutting down of several rural branches. Lots of negative PR ensued, therefore, but they were great ads nevertheless. Leo Burnett continued to produce entertaining stuff for McDonald's - this year, proving that 10 seconds can indeed be a creative time-frame. It came up with several spots in which we glimpsed a plumber tut-tutting at a leaking kitchen pipe, a removals man bashing a piano into a wall, and an estate agent opening and shutting a door to \"the lounge\" - all working for as long as it takes to earn the necessary 99p for a quarter pounder. BMP DDB also unveiled more classy work for VW, with a brilliantly-executed hymn to motoring for its Polo marque featuring a motorist delighting in various road blockages that mean he can stay in his Polo for longer. Aside from \"Whassup!\", 2000 was also the year of the spoof. Several ads gloriously satirised TV programmes and movies, one of the best being by Lowe Lintas for Weetabix, which borrowed heavily from the 70s TV show Black Beauty, using its opening sequence and familiar theme-tune (and tweaking the ending by having two exhausted, Weetabix-fuelled blokes climb out of a pantomime horse). WCRS similarly spoofed the wildlife epic Born Free in an ad for Land Rover's new Freelander, complete with pukka Zulu voiceover and stunning footage of the African plains. In September, another interesting trend emerged: stealth advertising. This was the term given to ads that were increasingly ditching any form of overt branding or product shots in favour of more minimal communication. Adidas' sponsorship of the Olympic Games exemplified the new style, starring Lee Evans in a series of hilarious films learning how to take part in various sports. These carried no evident branding and even ran as programming on the BBC. But 2000 did, of course, produce its fair share of stinkers. The sight of comedian Harry Hill in the excruciating tactical One2One commercial was anything but comic - just how many times can you recite a phone number in 30 seconds Harry? - and even BMP gaffed with its commercial for British Gas's new telephone service in which an irritating bloke comes home and starts warming his backside on a phone (er, hello?). Then there was Pringles, plumbing new depths with a spot for its pizza-flavoured variety that, apparently, get people dancing uncontrollably in the streets. And the notion that anyone could relate to Clerical Medical's female vicar and her doctor husband (clerical, medical - geddit?) talking about tuna sandwiches in a graveyard would have been funny if it hadn't been so surreal. The current spot for The Link with a girl sitting between two blokes and their giant mobile phones was similarly lamentable. \"No Jenny, buy this one!\" Pur-lease. Turkeys aside, 2000 will also be remembered as the year that former copywriter Matt Beaumont produced the best novel ever about advertising, e, and the year that a hilarious spoof film - The Truth About Advertising - gloriously took the mickey out of the industry and was emailed to everyone in Soho. In fact, nothing was sacred in 2000, as even Jonathan Glazer's Guinness epic \"surfer\" was spoofed in a spot for Polish brew EB Pils that featured a group of fat blokes on lilos on Southend beach. 2000 might have begun all pithy and post-apocalyptic, but it seems adland had thankfully rediscovered its sense of humour by the end.",

The villagers who fished her out decided that the best way to revive her was to rotate her head forcefully several times. </p> <p>By the time they had finished Nadia had been brain damaged. \"They tried to get the water out. She was never the same again,\" her mother Vathanakotti recalled, wiping away tears. </p> <p>Then there is Madhi, now 28, who contracted polio when he was four. The disease got gradually worse, leaving him with stick-like legs and a shrunken spine. At first he managed to get around his village in a hand-powered tricycle. But in recent years this has become impossible, and he has to rely on friends to give him a lift on the back of their scooters. </p> <p>And finally there is Chendru, who went blind in his mid-40s. He was too poor to pay to have his cataracts removed. He has made a few abortive attempts at goat-rearing to earn a living, but found this heavy going in the monsoon. </p> <p>His wife says he should try harder to find work. She is also embarrassed to hold his arm all the time. \"We are no longer teenage lovers,\" she complains. </p> <p>Nadia, Madhi and Chendru are members of what is probably the world's largest disabled community. Some 90m people in India - one and a half times the entire population of Britain - suffer from some kind of handicap. </p> <p>Many have the same diseases as their western counterparts.

The villagers who fished her out decided that the best way to revive her was to rotate her head forcefully several times. By the time they had finished Nadia had been brain damaged. \"They tried to get the water out. She was never the same again,\" her mother Vathanakotti recalled, wiping away tears. Then there is Madhi, now 28, who contracted polio when he was four. The disease got gradually worse, leaving him with stick-like legs and a shrunken spine. At first he managed to get around his village in a hand-powered tricycle. But in recent years this has become impossible, and he has to rely on friends to give him a lift on the back of their scooters. And finally there is Chendru, who went blind in his mid-40s. He was too poor to pay to have his cataracts removed. He has made a few abortive attempts at goat-rearing to earn a living, but found this heavy going in the monsoon. His wife says he should try harder to find work. She is also embarrassed to hold his arm all the time. \"We are no longer teenage lovers,\" she complains. Nadia, Madhi and Chendru are members of what is probably the world's largest disabled community. Some 90m people in India - one and a half times the entire population of Britain - suffer from some kind of handicap. Many have the same diseases as their western counterparts. But others have been struck down by entirely preventable maladies - polio, leprosy, and cataracts. Nowhere, perhaps, is it more true than on the subcontinent to say that poverty and disability go hand in hand. Disabled beggars are a feature of every Indian city.

It will have two clear responsibilities for the converging media world: to provide a framework for this vital market to flourish; and to uphold vigorously the interests of British society. </p> <p>This is a serious challenge, in a world where the only certainty will be change. The industry needs certainty and flexibility - contradictory desires - so the market can thrive. For the citizen, we must preserve the best we have: the quality of public service broadcasting and protection from unsuitable material for our children. And we do this at the same time as taking advantage of the opportunities for more choice. </p> <p>Everybody dislikes pointless bureaucracy. Until, of course, there is a scandal about unsuitable material being shown before the watershed, or news removed from peak time, or the loss of much-loved regional programmes. Then everybody wants effective regulation to protect citizens. We have made a serious attempt to deal with these conflicting and complicated issues. </p> <p>Some critics complain it isn't \"radical\". I suspect that they mean that there aren't any obvious headlines. Our priority was not to provide the media with an easy story. It was to set out a framework of regulation to stand Britain in good stead for years to come. </p> <p>One of our key aims was to ensure universal access to a choice of diverse services of the highest quality. Everyone must continue to have easy access to public service TV and radio channels. This will involve strengthening obligations to ensure that public service channels are available on satellite and cable through a mixture of \"must carry\" and \"must provide\" rules. We also anticipate the need to ensure that electronic programme guides provide genuine choice to the viewer. </p> <p>So we are introducing new rules to ensure that public service channels are given due prominence on electronic programme guides. It is not enough for these channels to be available and free. The viewer must also be able to find them easily. </p> <p>The communications white paper does not apologise for affirming the importance of public service broadcasting. It has after all helped to fuel the democratic explosion of knowledge and entertainment in the 20th century. We now have a choice of over 250 TV channels; 20 years ago we had three. But in this multi-channel, multi-platform age the white paper argues that public service broadcasting is even more important. </p> <p>In this context, the BBC Governors have a vital role as the champions of the BBC remit. Yes it might have been \"radical\" - and provided a good headline - to abolish the BBC Governors. But if we want to preserve and develop the BBC, it would not have been sensible. </p> <p>That doesn't mean the present system is perfect. We make proposals for substantial changes to the role of the Governors. External regulation needs to ensure that the BBC does not use its licence fee money to intervene unfairly in the market. It must ensure fair trading between the commercial and non-commercial aspects of the BBC's work. It must ensure that the BBC, like all other broadcasters, sticks to the basic rules for taste and decency. For the first time, we will be insisting that the BBC has an obligation, along with other public service broadcasters, to provide news and current affairs in peak time. And for the first time, there will be a new last port of call if the BBC complaints process does not satisfy a disgruntled viewer or listener. </p> <p>For the first time, the BBC joins ITV and Channel 4 in being externally regulated on its regional policy. The distinctive voices of the regions have been a real strength of our public service broadcasting system. Regional viewers need programmes that reflect their own concerns and interests. Cities around the country need the economic boost of regional tv production centres, making programmes and creating jobs, pathways into the new media and creative industries. </p> <p>In these and other areas, the white paper sets out a series of specific proposals for the future. The creation of Ofcom itself; the institution of a strong consumers' panel with teeth; the new regional obligations; the regulation of electronic programme guides and filtering mechanisms; the insistence on annual programming statements; the three-tier approach to broadcasting regulation to create a greater even-handedness between different broadcasters; the clear commitment to the public status of Channel 4; the removal of unnecessary barriers within commercial television. </p> <p>They also seek to balance the need for sensible care of the public interest with the responsible competitive freedom that can enhance choice and diversity. Some of it is very radical indeed. Some of it, rightly, is more cautious. Overall I think we've got the balance right. </p> <p>\u0095 Chris Smith is the secretary of state for culture, media and sport.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Genuinely the beginning of a new era for the corporation, 2000 was the year Greg Dyke took charge of the BBC and reinstated popular programmes, rather than paper pushers and management consultants, as the corporation's top priorities. The change in mindset was epitomised on Monday October 16, when BBC1 boldly defied politicians and moved its news to 10pm, with a scant two weeks' notice. </p> <p> This has unleashed the current nightly duel of the schedules with ITV, which will go on to dominate 2001. BBC1 plundered BBC2 for hits (Have I Got News For You? and The Weakest Link), while ITV defended its commercial heartland with every ruthless trick in the book, including starting its programmes at three minutes to the hour. </p> <p> The year ends with BBC1 bloodied but still battling, mustering every programme it can to keep its new 9-10 pm slots competitive. According to ITV, the BBC has won only five 9pm slots since the move: the opening night of October 16, with Men in Black, two episodes of One Foot in the Grave, a Royle Family and Silent Witness. </p> <p> It is acutely aware it faces parliamentary review after six months if audiences at 10pm fall below former 9pm levels and no one knows what will happen when ITV moves its news back to 10pm at the end of January. So far BBC1 has averaged 5.1m for news at 10pm, compared with 5m for the old 9pm news over the same period last year. Christmas Day 1999 saw BBC1 beaten by ITV in primetime for the first time in 14 years, a humiliation which hastened Peter Salmon's exit. This year his replacement Lorraine Heggessey will eat her turkey at peace: her schedule is buttressed with Big Al (a spin-off from Walking with Dinosaurs) and Titanic. </p> <p> All of this has happened since John Birt was flushed out of Broadcasting House on January 28. Partying staff were offered three yellow balloons printed with his face for \u00a31: they blew them up and stamped on them. His Royal Television Society farewell dinner was cancelled through a lack of appetite. His successor, meanwhile, had a distracting start when it was revealed he had failed to sell \u00a36m of Granada shares and a \"forgotten\" stash of \u00a3175,000 of Pearson shares. </p> <p> This became a theme of the year: do the BBC governors govern? But Dyke rode out the storm, and so have they. The expected mauling in last week's white paper failed to materialise. And the appointment of Gavyn Davies as vice chair suggests that joining the governors remains prestigious. </p> <p> With the licence fee pegged to inflation until 2006, spring saw the emergence from chaos of a new BBC, nattily organised as 16 petals in pastel shades. But since they all link to the centre, reporting direct to Dyke, the BBC remains in thrall to its director-general. </p> <p> With executive news editors scrapped, bi-media working trashed, news and current affairs returning eventually to Broadcasting House from Television Centre exile, and Jeff Randall hired to beef up business reporting, Hall's tenure looks to be coming to a close. </p> <p> In June, director of television Mark Thompson's Banff speech foreshadowed the repositioning of the TV channels: BBC1 more focused on popular entertainment; BBC2 becoming a network for 35-plus viewers; BBC3 aiming for youth, BBC4 for highbrows, with both metamorphosing in daytime into public service children's networks. Yet to be approved by Chris Smith, the latter proposal has infuriated the commercial children's channels. </p> <p> <strong> ITV </strong></p> <p> ITV started the new millennium as a bitterly divided federation run by three companies - Granada, Carlton and United - all keen to mate with each other. It ends up as better-balanced system with two masters, thanks to a competition commission report in July freeing Granada to bid for United. The white paper dangles the prospect of single ownership, but not until ITV's current hold over 60% of total TV advertising falls below 50% at least. </p> <p> With the post of chief executive still vacant, the ITV Network Centre and the ITC spent six months fighting, with both under big political pressure to bring back News at Ten. When ITV backed down in September and agreed to revive the flagship for three days a week, in a deal bro kered by the ITC's new head Patricia Hodgson, it found Dyke's \"think on your feet\" BBC nipping in first. The network also saw two percentage points vanish from its total audience share. But it ended the year strongly with a scorching autumn season, including the first million-winner on Millionaire, the 40th anniversary of Coronation Street, Cold Feet and Ask the Prime Minister. </p> <p> Meanwhile, ITN's proposed stock market float remains on ice while an election approaches, its 24-hour news channel takes time to bed in, and uncertainty about reinstating News at Ten continues. The whole sector is agog at the prospect of more news wars. </p> <p> <strong> Channels 4 and 5 </strong></p> <p>Channel 4 pioneered \"manipulated people shows\", 2000's hot genre, first with Shipwrecked then Big Brother, the first multi-media TV event. It ends the year with its reward - average audience share around 10.5%, slightly up on last year, and the gratifying news that BBC2 is going middle aged. Channel 4 News, extended to seven nights a week, was a good deed in a naughty world (audiences up 12%), but North Square's poor ratings highlighted drama failings. Michael Jackson pushed forward Homework High, a major expansion in online education, and ends the year with E4 ready to launch next month but a deal on racing still unsigned. The white paper affirmed his channel is not to be privatised - Gordon Brown has no stomach for it, nor need of the \u00a32bn it might raise - but there will have to be tougher public service obligations in exchange. </p> <p> Channel 5, four years old in April 2001, ends the year in transition (share stuck at 5.8%), with a big boost in programme funds about to strengthen promoted Dawn Airey's hands. She succeeds David Elstein, who guided the launch but abruptly quit in November. </p> <p><strong>Digital channels</strong></p> <p> Multi-channel Britain now has 6m digital TV households. BSkyB is on track to meet targets of 5m, and will end analogue transmissions next year - while ONdigital, the Carlton/Granada rival, is at 1m. In digital homes the share of viewing going to multi-channels has shot up to around 46%, hitting terrestrial hard. This is expected to persuade ITV, shortly, to join the Sky platform. Overall, it's less alarming: Sky channels increased their share of total TV viewing to 6.89% from 5.2% last year. </p> <p> BSkyB retained the Premier League rights in June, started Sky News Interactive in July as ITN launched its 24-hour News, and marketed the TiVo personal recorder in October. It spent the year grinding forward under chief executive Tony Ball. The personable Elisabeth Murdoch suddenly quit Sky in May, after four years, opting to spend more time at home with her partner Matthew Freud and small children. This left her policy of building up Sky One with original British production for the under-34s lacking a champion. Gritty ex-journalist Mark Sharman, who replaced her as Sky's director of broadcasting, warns that these are ferociously competitive times. </p> <p> No one knows that better than David Bergg, recruited as general manager of Sky One from ITV, but out after just one year of trying to reposition it more broadly for the \"Sunny Delight\" family. Projects like The Strangerers flopped, while a strategy of winning women to drama events such as Full Stretch was hit by the autumn ratings wars which have dragged viewers back to mainstream television. Sky One faces huge pressure from January from E4 and the loss to the newcomer of its Thursday night treats, first runs of Friends and ER. </p> <p> <strong> Radio </strong></p> <p> Helen Boaden, appointed controller of Radio 4 in March, is fast becoming the patron saint of the middle classes, fed up with being force-fed James Boyle's quizzes at 1.30 pm. Simply by agreeing to \"cherish\" the network, she's ended years of suspicion. Other critics have also been disarmed by her commitment to wooing junior listeners to speech radio, epitomised by the Boxing Day Harry Potter marathon. Overall, BBC Radio is on a roll from Radio 3 to its regional network, with a total audience share of 51.3%, convincingly ahead of commercial radio throughout the year. Radio 5 Live's new controller Bob Shennan, the first with a solid sports background, held onto Premier League football this autumn and recruited Simon Mayo from Radio 1. </p> <p> But there is some consolation for Kelvin MacKenzie, scourge of 5Live. His Wireless Group, based on TalkSport, was valued at \u00a3183m in May when it floated, raising \u00a340m for expansion. It is now worth \u00a3160m and seen as a major player. </p> <p> Commercial radio companies are disappointed with the white paper: a points system restricting any one owner to 15% of the total remains in force. GWR, owner of Classic FM, is bumping up against it after buying the Daily Mail's stations, and stratagems to park excess licences with allies have been scotched. Also, the white paper proposes placing a value on all spectrum: this potentially means none will be free in future, and the BBC could find itself asked to cede under-used frequencies. </p> <p> Eleven radio groups, including the BBC, have just set up a digital radio marketing board, to drive take-up and encourage shops to start stocking cheaper sets next spring. One day it may fly, but then so might pigs. </p> <p><strong>Turkeys and triumphs: a year in programmes</strong></p> <p><strong> HITS</strong> </p> <p><strong> Big Brother</strong> <br>Love it or hate it, undeniably the television event of the year </p> <p><strong> Who Wants to be a Millionaire?</strong> <br>Finally achieved its raison d'etre with a \u00a31m winner </p> <p><strong> Cold Feet</strong> <br>Matured into the must-watch drama of the autumn season </p> <p><strong> My Family </strong><br> At last, the BBC gets a sitcom right, with some US help </p> <p><strong> History of Britain</strong> <br>Good old BBC factual triumphs again with a Simon Schama epic worthy of the word \"landmark\" </p> <p><strong> The Weakest Link</strong> <br>Anne Robinson reinvents herself with a catchphrase that entered the cultural lexicon </p> <p><strong> Clocking Off</strong> <br>BBC1's stunning drama </p> <p><strong> SMTV Live</strong><br>Ant, Dec and Cat whip their BBC opposition every Saturday morning </p> <p><strong> So Graham Norton</strong><br>With a lucrative golden handcuffs deal, the campest man on TV reinvents the chat show format on Channel 4 </p> <p><strong> Tonight with Trevor McDonald</strong><br>From a dodgy start, ITV's current affairs show's upward advance culminated in the conjoined twins exclusive </p> <p><strong> Channel 4 News</strong> <br>After a risky relaunch, Jon Snow and the team led the way in broadcast news </p> <p><strong> MISSES </strong> </p> <p><strong>TFI Friday</strong><br>Axed at last.

      "bodyText": "Lord Birt and other media peers including Lord Hollick, rank among the poorest attendees at the House of Lords. The former director general of the BBC, now Tony Blair's part-time crime czar, has attended Parliament just 55 times since he took his seat as a cross-bencher on March 7. While Lord Hollick, United News &amp; Media boss and former owner of the Express, attended the Lords just 21 times in the past year. Other peers from media and showbusiness show even less interest in the role they could play in shaping the country's future through voting on legislation going through the House of Lords. Lord Lloyd-Webber appeared just three times in the past year, according to records just compiled by the House, while award-winning movie-maker Lord Attenborough visited the house on only five occasions. Lord Birt, 56, however ranks as one of the worst attendees and voters among those ennobled by Tony Blair since he swept to power in 1997. Analysis by MediaGuardian.co.uk of attendance records of the 117 peers appointed by Blair to sit as cross-benchers or to represent Labour in the House of Lords, put Lord Birt 28th from bottom. He has only voted 16 times - 13 occasions of those with the government - out of a possible 173 opportunities. As a cross-bencher Lord Birt has no party political ties or pressure to turn up. And, in his defence, his records run only from March to November, just eight months of the Westminster calender. However, his voting and attendance records contrast sharply to those of other media peers ennobled in the past three years. Lord Alli, a former Carlton TV executive and co-creator of Channel 4's Big Breakfast, has attended 119 times in the past year and voted 130 times out a possible 192. And Lord Bragg, often dismissed as a Labour luvvie, is among the most committed peers having attended the House of Lords on 134 occasions between November 17 1999 and November 30 this year and has voted 150 times. Constitional expert Dr David Starkey branded the records a \"devastating indictment\" of reform in the House of Lords. \"What this shows is that this is merely a collection of appointees , some of whom can't be bothered to turn up. It is the most devastating indictment of all. \"And people like Lord Birt are just too self-important. They have to sit in a forum where everyone is treated equally and he wouldn't be used to that,\" Dr Starkey said. He added: \"The whole clubbability of the Lords is something that someone who has been at the top of an organistion or a high flyer finds deeply unsympathatic.\" However one peer says there are many who simply use the House as an up-market lunch club. \"They just flit in, flit out, use the dining room to impress their friends and don't bother to hang round for the late evening votes,\" he said. Lord Birt was not available for comment but his undistinguished record reflects a general ambivalence among independent peers who evidently like the status but care less for the power that goes with a seat in the Lords. \"They don't have any whips telling them to come in to give the party support,\" said one Whitehall official. He added: \"It is not at all surprising that he has voted just 16 times. Many of them don't want to vote if they haven't attended the debates.\" Lord Birt left the BBC in January and, unlike Lord Hollick, does not have a full-time job. Nevertheless he is one of Labour's inner circle and his new job as the prime minister's part-time \"crime czar\" has led to accusations of \"cronyism\". Other peers ennobled for services in the media include Lord Birt's former colleague, Lord Hussey, the former chairman of the BBC. He became a cross bencher in 1996 and was one of best attendees this year, putting in an appearance on 113 days. None of the peers contacted were available for comment apart from Andrew Lloyd Webber. A spokesman for Lord Webber said: \"He is not a working peer and was given his peerage for services to the arts.\" Although peers receive no salary, they get an allowance of up to \u00a384 a day plus travel expenses simply for appearing - whether they vote or not.

Canal Plus boss Pierre Lescure has delayed announcing the results of a strategic review, amid the prospect of a legal challenge from disgruntled French independent film producers. Despite clearance from French watchdogs, the merger is seen as a threat to the French film industry by smaller companies, who depend on a subsidy from the channel to finance their movies. Canal Plus, which is 49%-owned by Vivendi, pays around \u00a390m per year to film-makers for the right to broadcast their movies first. The new company, called Vivendi Universal, combines Vivendi's extensive internet and telecoms operations with Seagram's Universal Music and Universal Film subsidiaries.

A Canal Plus spokesman said: \"We have invested a lot in the industry and we will continue to invest a lot over the next five years.

      "body": "<p>The fuel crisis has triggered a sharp u-turn in the fortunes of Eddie Stobart, the 800-strong fleet of green and gold lorries with a nationwide cult following. </p> <p>The Carlisle-based haulage company is set to plunge into the red for the first time in 30 years, after shelling out an extra \u00a3500,000 a month to meet higher petrol prices. </p> <p>Stobart's commercial director Richard Butcher said at the weekend that the firm's profit margin of 3% had been wiped out. He insisted the company was not in serious financial difficulties and predicted that a restructuring would lead to renewed profits next year. </p> <p>Eddie Stobart's distinctive lorries are well known to motorway travellers throughout the country. As \"Eddie Spotting\" has become an increasingly popular pastime, the company has built up a 30,000-strong fan club. </p> <p>Earlier this year, profits from merchandise - including toy lorries, t-shirts and Eddie Teddies - overtook the firm's earnings from haulage for the first time. </p> <p>News of the company's difficulties will be a blow to Eddie Stobart drivers.

      "bodyText": "The fuel crisis has triggered a sharp u-turn in the fortunes of Eddie Stobart, the 800-strong fleet of green and gold lorries with a nationwide cult following. The Carlisle-based haulage company is set to plunge into the red for the first time in 30 years, after shelling out an extra \u00a3500,000 a month to meet higher petrol prices. Stobart's commercial director Richard Butcher said at the weekend that the firm's profit margin of 3% had been wiped out. He insisted the company was not in serious financial difficulties and predicted that a restructuring would lead to renewed profits next year. Eddie Stobart's distinctive lorries are well known to motorway travellers throughout the country. As \"Eddie Spotting\" has become an increasingly popular pastime, the company has built up a 30,000-strong fan club. Earlier this year, profits from merchandise - including toy lorries, t-shirts and Eddie Teddies - overtook the firm's earnings from haulage for the first time. News of the company's difficulties will be a blow to Eddie Stobart drivers. More than 120 job losses have already been announced this month, partly due to the closure of a depot in Lincolnshire. Mr Stobart, who owns the business with his brother William, disclosed in September that fuel blockades were forcing his lorries off the road and costing the company \u00a3250,000 a day. The Road Haulage Association yesterday said Eddie Stobart's problems were typical of the pressures facing hauliers. A spokeswoman for the association said: \"Given the problems being faced by hauliers at the moment, I'd be surprised if many firms in the industry ended the year in profit. \"More and more operators, especially smaller ones, are going out of business.\" In addition to higher fuel prices, a relaxation on European rules has hurt British hauliers. Foreign truckers are allowed to do more local work in trips to Britain than they were in the past. The Road Haulage Association welcomed a freeze in fuel taxes announced in last month's Budget, but is pressing for more government action to help drivers. Eddie Stobart is the country's biggest supplier of food and drinks to supermarkets.

The shadow chancellor said Labour's growth record was not particularly good, with expansion of 2.3% a year comparing unfavourably with the preceding 15 years under the Conservatives. Did you spot the statistical sleight of hand? The Conservatives were in power for 18 years, between 1979 and 1997, so why should Portillo only want to look at 1982-97? Easy. The period from 1979 to 1981 included the worst recession since the second world war and by excluding the period of turbo-charged monetarism the Conservative growth record looks better than Labour's. Portillo was not telling fibs, simply not telling the whole truth. </p> <p>Putting the best possible gloss on the numbers is such an integral part of \"selling\" the political product that there is no chance of politicians cleaning up their act. A bigger handicap to good governance, however, may be that we are counting too much and counting the wrong things. In his forthcoming book*, David Boyle argues just: \"What really matters can't be counted. If you make the attempt but measure the wrong thing, it isn't just wasted effort. It can destroy everything you can work for. Like the school league tables that make teachers concentrate on getting borderline pupils through at the expense of their weaker classmates. Or the hospital waiting lists that fell because only quick, simple problems were treated.\" </p> <p>Updating Wilde's witticism, Boyle says that we can count everything but see the significance of nothing. We are in thrall to the idea promulgated by the management consultancy firm McKinsey &amp; Co which asserts that anything can be counted, and anything that can be counted can also be measured. Good news for McKinsey. </p> <p>Boyle is right to question this approach. It harks back to the high pomp of modernism, when it was assumed that a technocratic elite could scientifically measure activity and use the findings to chart a serene course for the economy. We now know life is a lot more chaotic than that. It is time to admit that reducing everything to a single number - the gross domestic product of the economy - is pointless and sometimes dangerous. It is impossible to be precise about inflation, growth or unemployment, so why pretend that we can be? One reason large-scale modelling has fallen into disrepute is that too much faith was invested in the power of machines to come up with rock-solid forecasts upon which to base policy judgments. </p> <p>This is true at the macro-economic and micro-economic level. Under the traditional rules of accountancy, when a company sells off a fleet of cars before they are worn out it has to record the transaction as a loss in its books. But when it sacks staff it has trained, who know how the company works and have ideas about it can be made to perform better, that does not have to be logged. Indeed, it is seen as eliminating cost, adding to the financial health of the company. The move towards knowledge-based industries makes the old way of measuring redundant. </p> <p>Boyle argues that the most important things are not measurable with numbers; they tend to simplify complex problems and distort them, so we do not get what we want or need. In the post-war period both Conservative and Labour governments became fixated with the target of building 300,000 homes a year, resulting in a scramble to flatten low-rise housing stock to make way for jerry-built tower blocks. The social implications of that have been far-reaching. </p> <p>There are three possibilities. We can count less, trusting to our instincts more. We can count different things, as is happening in cities such as Seattle, where there are new indicators of well-being such as the number of books lent by libraries, attendance at arts events, the number of latchkey children.

We meet not under the pall of socio-cultural meltdown but to compare waistlines, reminisce and play Connect 4 against a backdrop of toddlers' shrieks. The statistics suggest that, as people of Caribbean descent, we are at the end of an era, but all I see is the beginning of a new generation.</p> <p>The statistics are not the problem. Berthoud's work is an intelligent, sensitive examination of complex and important issues. The problem is the unintelligent and insensitive conclusions that some will jump to in order to confirm their own prejudices. The numbers are neutral; it is the context that discriminates.

According to a recent Guardian/ICM poll, over the past five years the proportion of whites who say they would not mind if a close relative married a black or Asian person has doubled while those who would mind \"a little or a lot\" has halved.</p> <p>From the growing number of Caribbeans in mixed-race relationships, one may also presume that the proportion of black people who fear that social assimilation will lead to cultural extinc tion has also dropped. These fears were always unfounded. Culture is not genetic or static but, among other things, historical, political, economic and dynamic. Nor is the mixed-race experience alien to the Caribbean experience. Bob Marley, who did more to promote Caribbean culture than anyone else alive or dead, was mixed-race.</p> <p>But by far the most common misconception, particularly among liberals, is that a rise in mixed-race relationships signals, a priori, an increase in racial tolerance. People who would otherwise argue that politics should be taken out of the bedroom cannot help trying to slip sociology under the sheets. One wonders, if this is the case, why the group most likely to be involved in mixed-race relationships - young black men - is also the group most likely to be stopped, searched, jailed and excluded. If \"every mixed-race marriage is building a better Britain\", as one commentator claimed, then logic suggests the break-up of any mixed-race marriage makes Britain worse.</p> <p>The large number of inter-racial relationships does point to a welcome degree of social interaction between black and white people that would not be possible in a more segregated society, such as America. But no more than that. Inter-racial relationships may be a useful barometer of social intercourse between different ethnic groups. But that does not make sexual intercourse a barometer of racial harmony. If there is a meaningful political conclusion to be drawn from incidences of mixed-race relationships, I have yet to see one. They are what they are - people trying to find sex, love or comfort (and hopefully sometimes all three) the best way they know.</p> <p>So while the high number of mixed relationships is undoubtedly interesting, the most important factor to emerge from the report is the consequences of the high propensity of relationships involving or between Caribbeans to collapse. The issue here is not the institution of marriage or even the primacy of stable relationships. This is about a financial, social and emotional commitment to children and support for those who look after them.</p> <p>Many estranged Caribbean male partners are dutiful fathers; but all too many are not. The burden of these break-ups falls on women of Caribbean descent, on a large number (but far lower proportion) of white women, and on the children. Caribbean lone parents are considerably more likely to work than their white counterparts, but more than half depend on income support.</p> <p>This exposes an unacceptable number of children to child poverty, while depriving them of accessible and vital male role models. It also leaves women, whether they are black or white, working or not, keeping everything together, often in difficult circumstances. We are not talking about victimhood here. According to the report, Caribbean women are more assertive within relationships than women from other ethnic groups, including whites. We are talking about regular maintenance and trips to the zoo, bedtime stories and school runs.</p> <p>While these issues are often discussed within the Caribbean community there are few opportunities to deal with them intelligently in the broader arena. This is understandable, for the barrier to that discussion is not \"political correctness\" - whatever that is - but racism. A society in which a black man, Delroy Lindo, can be subjected to 37 stop and searches, charged and cleared 17 times and arrested for allegedly \"sucking his teeth in an aggressive manner\" does not provide a conducive climate in which to discuss where black men might be going wrong. It is lamentable, for it leaves a deafening silence where a vigorous and important debate should be. Like government ministers dealing with soft drugs, we refuse to address a problem in the hope that it will go away - when the truth is that by not addressing it we only make it worse.</p> <p>According to the report, \"17% of Caribbean men in their 20s have virtually no qualifications, no family and no job - and are not students either\". Craig David's pop tune Walking Away risks becoming a depressing anthem for a generation of men whose mothers found solace in Gloria Gaynor's I Will Survive. In the words of the late African- American intellectual, W E B Dubois: \"Our worst side has been so shamelessly emphasised that we are denying that we ever had a worst side. In all sorts of ways we are being hemmed in.\"</p> <p>What we need now is an attitudinal survey - underpinned by a similar degree of sensitivity and intelligence - so we can find out why a disproportionate number of black men are fathering children but not supporting them or helping to raise them. Even as I type, I can hear the drills whirr.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:gary.younge@theguardian.com\">gary.younge@theguardian.com</a></p>",

They are what they are - people trying to find sex, love or comfort (and hopefully sometimes all three) the best way they know. So while the high number of mixed relationships is undoubtedly interesting, the most important factor to emerge from the report is the consequences of the high propensity of relationships involving or between Caribbeans to collapse. The issue here is not the institution of marriage or even the primacy of stable relationships. This is about a financial, social and emotional commitment to children and support for those who look after them. Many estranged Caribbean male partners are dutiful fathers; but all too many are not. The burden of these break-ups falls on women of Caribbean descent, on a large number (but far lower proportion) of white women, and on the children. Caribbean lone parents are considerably more likely to work than their white counterparts, but more than half depend on income support. This exposes an unacceptable number of children to child poverty, while depriving them of accessible and vital male role models. It also leaves women, whether they are black or white, working or not, keeping everything together, often in difficult circumstances. We are not talking about victimhood here. According to the report, Caribbean women are more assertive within relationships than women from other ethnic groups, including whites. We are talking about regular maintenance and trips to the zoo, bedtime stories and school runs. While these issues are often discussed within the Caribbean community there are few opportunities to deal with them intelligently in the broader arena. This is understandable, for the barrier to that discussion is not \"political correctness\" - whatever that is - but racism. A society in which a black man, Delroy Lindo, can be subjected to 37 stop and searches, charged and cleared 17 times and arrested for allegedly \"sucking his teeth in an aggressive manner\" does not provide a conducive climate in which to discuss where black men might be going wrong. It is lamentable, for it leaves a deafening silence where a vigorous and important debate should be. Like government ministers dealing with soft drugs, we refuse to address a problem in the hope that it will go away - when the truth is that by not addressing it we only make it worse. According to the report, \"17% of Caribbean men in their 20s have virtually no qualifications, no family and no job - and are not students either\". Craig David's pop tune Walking Away risks becoming a depressing anthem for a generation of men whose mothers found solace in Gloria Gaynor's I Will Survive. In the words of the late African- American intellectual, W E B Dubois: \"Our worst side has been so shamelessly emphasised that we are denying that we ever had a worst side. In all sorts of ways we are being hemmed in.\" What we need now is an attitudinal survey - underpinned by a similar degree of sensitivity and intelligence - so we can find out why a disproportionate number of black men are fathering children but not supporting them or helping to raise them. Even as I type, I can hear the drills whirr. gary.younge@theguardian.com",

Its aim is to help women and their children enjoy a future free from physical and emotional abuse. Foundation for International Environmental Law and Development provides legal advice on environmental issues, often to smaller countries which cannot afford the fees of commercial lawyers, to ensure they are fairly represented at international negotiations and conferences. The Place 2 Be sends counsellors into primary schools to offer emotional and therapeutic support to children who are troubled, unhappy and confused.",

He is the boy from the Bronx who rose to the top; the Vietnam GI who got to run the regiment; the Washington desk-warrior who became a role model for African-Americans and a conscience-cleanser for whites; the Cincinnatus of the streets who, retiring as Pentagon overlord in 1993 and scorning a bid for the presidency, returned to the plough (or, in his case, lucrative book deals and repairing old Volvos). Gen Powell, it is said, is a hero, the personification of the American dream.</p> <p>Unfortunately, his new job is about dealing with the deeply unheroic realities of life beyond America. For this he appears unsuited, except as a symbol of a different kind: the symbol of this new administration's likely refusal to engage on equal terms with a world it by turns distrusts, fears, cannot understand and seeks to dominate. Gen Powell is famous for his military doctrine of \"overwhelming force\". His role now is to be the patriotic face of the equally menacing, go-it-alone \"new unilateralism\", the passport-challenged Dubya's foreign buffer, and the chief projectionist of a global power that seems increasingly unreceptive to the idea of shared global responsibility.</p> <p>Gen Powell has made a career out of refusing to get involved. He advised against US intervention in Panama in 1989, against military action after the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and against US nation-building in Somalia. He firmly opposes UN command of US troops and will reinforce Mr Bush's scepticism about international peacekeeping. In 1993, he thwarted those who wanted the US to relieve Sarajevo and halt ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. He was critical of Bill Clinton's decision to get involved in Kosovo. While he now says he will merely review Balkan force levels, it may be assumed that he will want to bring US troops home at the first opportunity.</p> <p>Yet when Gen Powell has actually got involved, the results, contrary to myth, have often been unhappy. Those who were there do not forget the civilian casualties in Panama City, victims of the general's excessive use of force; or the mess inside Iraq after Desert Storm was prematurely halted on his advice. At the Pentagon, Gen Powell stated emotively that American soldiers' lives came first, before anything else. It was always a silly argument. Simply sitting pat in the state department \"putting America first\" would be even sillier. It will melt no ice, for example, in Taipei, Srinagar, Pristina or Bethlehem. Such flashpoints are complex, messy and highly dangerous to all. They require skilled, informed, hands-on commitment at the top. There are no clear-cut solutions. And if the job is to be done properly, there is no exit strategy.</p> <p>But, like his boss, Gen Powell seems determined to delimit the US world role, to view international obligations through the prism of narrow, national interest. Yet, again like Mr Bush, he believes the US retains the right to threaten unfavoured regimes, dictate global business and trade terms, ignore environmental standards, flout treaties, defy international law, and build destabilising, self-insulating missile systems in defiance of allies and adversaries alike.

      "body": "<p>Few would doubt Muhammad Ali's place as one of the great figures of the last century. He achieved global fame as an athlete, became a powerful spokesman for his people and a principled advocate for social justice - even forfeiting his champion's title rather than serve in Vietnam. But perhaps his greatest achievement is not yet complete. The eloquent testimony of his own deterioration into disability may yet prove his lasting legacy. For Muhammad Ali, once boxing's shining exponent, is now a living warning of the dangers of the ring. He has been reduced to virtual immobility, his once-fast tongue slowed and slurred - all because he took punches for three decades.</p> <p>We mention him now because of the fate of a less-starred fellow boxer. On Saturday night Paul Ingle sustained serious brain injuries after losing to South Africa's Mbulelo Botile in Sheffield. He spent yesterday in hospital, in a \"critical but stable\" condition after surgeons laboured for two and half hours to remove a blood clot from his brain. Predictably, the British Boxing Board of Control has put on its concerned face, promising \"to launch an inquiry\" and look for \"lessons to be learned\".</p> <p>But these cliches are no longer good enough. Boxing cannot sincerely \"inquire\" into the circumstances of Saturday's fight or look for lessons, as if what happened to Paul Ingle was a freak accident - like a plane collision or a rail crash. When a disaster of that kind strikes, it is because something wholly unexpected has happened. But for a man to suffer brain damage after his brain has been pummelled - deliberately and with precision - is wholly to be expected. It is no surprise at all. Ask Michael Watson, still confined to a wheelchair after his fight against Chris Eubank in 1991. Ask Gerald McClellan, beaten into a coma in 1995 and now in need of 24-hour-a-day care. Ask the family of Bradley Stone, killed by his 1994 bantamweight bout. Or take one last look at Muhammad Ali.</p> <p>No liberal calls for a ban on any activity lightly. But we repeat our long-held belief that boxing has no place in a civilised society. To those who say a ban would only drive the sport underground, we point to bear-baiting and cock-fighting: they were banned and have all but vanished from British life. We wish the same fate for the sport which has laid waste to too many young men, including the greatest among them.</p>",

He has been reduced to virtual immobility, his once-fast tongue slowed and slurred - all because he took punches for three decades. We mention him now because of the fate of a less-starred fellow boxer. On Saturday night Paul Ingle sustained serious brain injuries after losing to South Africa's Mbulelo Botile in Sheffield. He spent yesterday in hospital, in a \"critical but stable\" condition after surgeons laboured for two and half hours to remove a blood clot from his brain. Predictably, the British Boxing Board of Control has put on its concerned face, promising \"to launch an inquiry\" and look for \"lessons to be learned\". But these cliches are no longer good enough. Boxing cannot sincerely \"inquire\" into the circumstances of Saturday's fight or look for lessons, as if what happened to Paul Ingle was a freak accident - like a plane collision or a rail crash. When a disaster of that kind strikes, it is because something wholly unexpected has happened. But for a man to suffer brain damage after his brain has been pummelled - deliberately and with precision - is wholly to be expected. It is no surprise at all. Ask Michael Watson, still confined to a wheelchair after his fight against Chris Eubank in 1991. Ask Gerald McClellan, beaten into a coma in 1995 and now in need of 24-hour-a-day care. Ask the family of Bradley Stone, killed by his 1994 bantamweight bout. Or take one last look at Muhammad Ali. No liberal calls for a ban on any activity lightly. But we repeat our long-held belief that boxing has no place in a civilised society. To those who say a ban would only drive the sport underground, we point to bear-baiting and cock-fighting: they were banned and have all but vanished from British life. We wish the same fate for the sport which has laid waste to too many young men, including the greatest among them.",

      "bodyText": "America's European allies are girding themselves for a new era in transatlantic relations, with the prospect of a Bush administration refusing to bail them out of crises in the way Washington has done for decades. \"It will not be business as usual,\" a Nato official said yesterday. General Colin Powell \"does not want to engage\", he added, in a reference to Mr Bush's secretary of state-elect who as a military leader was reluctant to involve US forces in Bosnia or the Gulf war. \"The Americans are anyway going to do less and if the Europeans do not do more the US is going to do much less,\" said a senior European military official, referring to American involvement in Europe. Instead, he said, Washington would increasingly concern itself with the Pacific - with Taiwan and Korea - and with Afghanistan, the base of Islamic extremist Osama bin Laden. European concern about the prospects of a Bush victory bordered on panic just before the election. Condoleezza Rice, Mr Bush's national security adviser, said that if he reached the White House he planned to tell Nato that the US would no longer take part in peacekeeping in the Balkans. \"The governor is talking about a new division of labour,\" Ms Rice told the New York Times. \"The United States is the only power that can handle a showdown in the Gulf, mount the kind of force that is needed to protect Saudi Arabia and deter a crisis in the Taiwan straits. And extended peacekeeping detracts from our readiness from these kinds of global missions.\" A few days later, the Nato secretary general, Lord Robertson, said he had been contacted by senior Bush aides who had made it clear \"there will be no unilateral action taken in relation to peacekeeping forces by a President Bush administration\". Despite talk of consultation, there is little doubt in Europe that the continent will increasingly be left to its own devices by a Bush administration. That is not to say Europeans believe the US will become more isolationist. \"It will be an activist foreign policy,\" Jonathan Eyal, director of studies of the Royal United Services Institute, said yesterday. A concern in Europe is that the US will adopt more unilateralist policies in pursuit of what Mr Bush calls \"American internationalism\". If US interests are perceived to be a threat, a Bush administration will want to intervene on its own terms, decisively but with no longer-term commitments - Gen Powell repeatedly worried about what he called \"exit strategies\". One issue needing Gen Powell's attention is the US plan for a national missile defence (NMD) system, a project opposed by Washington's Nato allies as well as Russia and China. Tony Blair's advisers are deeply sceptical about both its technical feasibility and its destabilising effect on arms control deals.

      "body": "<p>A month from now, George W Bush will be inaugurated as the President of the United States, and along with a Republican administration and a Republican congress, the presidential pendulum will swing back in the direction of a Republican First Lady.</p> <p>Historically, the more politically active First Ladies have been the wives of Democratic presidents - Edith Wilson, Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosalynn Carter. Now, after eight years of the powerful, mutable, shape-shifting, glamorous and politically divisive Hillary Rodham Clinton, who embodied the conflicts and contradictions of modern women trying to balance career and family, we will have the sweet, ex-librarian Laura Bush, whose declared interests will be libraries and literacy, and whose image, I would predict, will be somewhat more fashionable but otherwise stable over the next four years.</p> <p>Even more important for the national psyche, fastening itself on the First Lady as the prime case study for the intersection of women's private and public lives, Americans for the first time ever in our history will have a Queen Mum. The Bush administration will mean the return to the public eye, if not the White House, of 75-year-old grandmother of 14, Barbara Bush, one of the most admired and beloved First Ladies of the century as well as one of the most traditional.</p> <p>Indeed, Barbara Bush's term as First Lady was marked by debate about her decision to be a wife and mother first, and to subordinate her own ideas to those of her adored Poppy. During the New Hampshire primary campaign of 1979, the Today show presenter Jane Pauley asked her in an interview: \"Mrs Bush, people say that your husband is a man of the 80s and that you are a woman of the 40s. What do you say to that?\"</p> <p>As Barbara Bush recalled in her 1994 memoir, she was \"speechless and heartsick\", perhaps at the innuendo that she was too old for George Bush; and relieved when the taping went wrong and the question had to be dropped. None the less, despite her immense popularity, Mrs Bush had to face such questions again and again.</p> <p>During her first year as First Lady, Ladybird Johnson's former press secretary, Liz Carpenter, criticised Barbara Bush for letting women down by refusing to speak out on important issues where she disagreed with her husband, particularly abortion and gun control.</p> <p>In the memoir, Bush published a response that she had written but never mailed: \"Long ago I decided that in life I had to have priorities. I put my husband and children at the top of my list. That's a choice that I never regretted.\" Moreover, she added, her social priorities were literacy and education. \"Abortion, pro or con, is not a priority for me. ERA is not a priority for me, nor is gun control. I leave that for those courageous enough to run for public office.\"</p> <p>In 1990, 150 undergraduates at Hillary Rodham Clinton's alma mater, Wellesley College, protested when Mrs Bush was selected as the commencement speaker, since her main accomplishment was having married a famous man. But the fracas won her sympathy and support from prominent feminists, who saw the issue as one of respect for women's choice.</p> <p>\"At the end of your life,\" she told the students at Wellesley, \"you will never regret not having passed one more test, not winning one more verdict, or not closing one more deal. You will regret time not spent with a husband, a friend, a child, or a parent.\"</p> <p>Typically, for Barbara Bush the goals of achievement and devotion seemed mutually exclusive for women, although she was by no means an ordinary housewife, mother, friend or daughter.</p> <p>She had spent most of her adult life as the partner of the handsome, ambitious, risk-taking George Bush, had mothered five children (including a daughter who died at the age of three from leukaemia), had met thousands of people and travelled all over the world. In their first 100 days in office, she recorded, the Bushes visited nine states and four countries, had 51 overnight guests, and fed 5,825 people.</p> <p>She had met George Bush when she was 16 at a dance at the Round Hill Country Club in Greenwich, and it was love at first sight. Barbara was attending a girls' boarding school in Charleston, South Carolina where she was the record holder in speed knitting and underwater swimming. He was at Andover; after Pearl Harbour he enlisted and they became secretly engaged.</p> <p>While he was in the navy, Barbara attended Smith for a year, but dropped out without regret as soon as he returned and they could marry. He graduated from Yale, but she made no effort to return to college; life with the gregarious George Bush was adventure and career enough for two people. Indeed, apart from the death of their child, Barbara Bush admits to having suffered from only one period of serious depression in her life - that was in 1976 when her husband returned to Washington after a joyous and challenging stint as ambassador to China to become head of the CIA.</p> <p>In Beijing, the Bushes had been partners, a true team; they had both studied Chinese, and Barbara had steeped herself in Chinese culture and history. Now his work was secret and time-consuming. Moreover, as she realised during their years away, the women's liberation movement had changed the tone of public life, and, she later said, \"women's lib ... made that woman who stayed home feel that she had somehow or another been a failure\".</p> <p>For over six months, she was \"very depressed, lonely, and unhappy\". At moments she felt almost suicidal: \"Sometimes the pain was so great, I felt the urge to drive into a tree or an oncoming car.\" Yet in stoic New England style, she kept it to herself and refused to see a therapist. By the 90s, she had decided that the problem was largely due to a \"chemical imbalance\" caused by menopause, and exacerbated because \"I could not share in George's job after years of being so involved; and our children were all gone\".</p> <p>But now, with their own political campaigns and struggles in the past, Barbara Bush will bring back some welcome memories of self-deprecating humour, uncoloured hair, three-strand pearl chokers and wrinkles.</p> <p>In a new century where the standard for female physical perfection is constantly rising, and women now publicly excoriate themselves for wearing a size in the double digits, her cheerful acknowledgment of her figure flaws, and jokes that she was born weighing 135 pounds, seem doubly endearing.</p> <p>While others are having facelifts and tummy tucks, Mrs Bush notes, \"lots of people want to redo me. My favorite so far was the lady who took the Life magazine picture, gave me a new haircut, new earrings, necklace, clothes, make-up, and sent me a slide she had taken of her work of art.\"</p> <p>While some may list among their books of the year works in Croatian or Spanish, she happily enjoys reading Maeve Binchy and Iris Dart. Although she is a doting grandmother, she delights in tales of children's mischief and normality; when one little grandson sitting in the President's Box at the Kennedy Center announced that his penis hurt (he had tight suspenders), she was amused and compassionate. And although she loves to eat, she has no pretensions about her recipes or her cooking.</p> <p>Once, she has confessed, she attempted to prepare a fish for George and, after many hours of chopping, boning, skinning and stuffing the creature, wrestled this \"smelly, slippery thing on the platter.\" He, too, responded sensibly: \"You don't think I'm going to eat this shit, do you?\"</p> <p>Athough she notes that her editor had to insist that she restricted the use of the terms \"wonderful\" and \"precious\" in her memoir, Barbara Bush is not saccharine or anodyne, either and, like her husband, she has the capacity to make sharp observations about the famous and powerful. She described Jesse Jackson as being \"a big man who fills a room. He must be a chore for the Democrats. He has his own agenda and has never missed a funeral, a strike, or a march.\"</p> <p>On Danielle Mitterand: \"a fascinating woman\", who regaled her for 45 minutes on the plight of the Kurds. Sleepy and hot, Mrs Bush prayed that she would not doze off or ask for more information about the \"Turds\". Dick Cheney: \"so steady and no-nonsense.\" Rosalynn Carter: \"She is not as happy and content as she should be.\"</p> <p>Although she is blind to the imperfections of her husband, she was not beyond teasing her children. George W, she has said, \"is the son who pulls no punches and tells it like he thinks it is.\"</p> <p>When Bush lost to Clinton, it was George W who told them in the late afternoon of election day that, based on the exit polls, his father would lose. Prince Charles came to dinner at Camp David, and Mrs Bush noted that, \"he was the age of our oldest son, although I liked to tease George W that the Prince was much better dressed and considerably more polite!\"</p> <p>She told Queen Elizabeth that her \"Texas son\" was the dangerous one who had to be seated far down the table: \"He said what he felt and besides that, he threatened to wear cowboy boots in the evening to the State Dinner.\"</p> <p>Does the return of the Bush women signal a return to pre-feminist values? I think the country is as closely and deeply divided on this point as it is on all the rest. Now that she is no longer in politics herself, and has no more campaigns to fight, Barbara Bush may be able to speak out with more candour than she could in the past. Certainly, Americans will allow her leeway as a grandmother, a White House veteran and as the First Mum that she could not have before.</p> <p>When Hillary Clinton came into the White House, she was asked in an interview how she felt about the differences between her and Barbara Bush. \"She made her life choices and lived them in an exemplary fashion. She has been quoted as saying that she doesn't know what choices she would have made had she been born 20 or 30 years later.\"</p> <p>Maybe the twists of this historic election will be giving Barbara Bush a second chance.</p> <p><b>Key rulings</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.supremecourtus.gov/florida.html\" target=\"_new\">US supreme court rulings </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.flcourts.org/pubinfo/election/index.html\" target=\"_new\">Florida supreme court rulings</a></p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,410769,00.html\">Florida moves to hand Bush victory</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Columnists/Column/0,5673,410788,00.html\">Jonathan Freedland: a nation divided</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,399153,00.html\">Timeline - how we got here</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,398516,00.html\">Election glossary</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/graphic/0,5543,398700,00.html\">Graphic: Know your chad</a><br></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gall/0,8542,409877,00.html\">After the vote, before the ruling</a></p> <p><b>Interactive</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/flash/0,5543,394350,00.html\">Results declared, state by state</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b> <br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/1204borger.ra\">'People are beginning to ask questions'</a><br> <b>3 December 2000:</b> Julian Borger in Tallahassee on the black voters denied their rights.

      "bodyText": "The far-right Austrian leader J\u00f6rg Haider flew home yesterday after a visit to the Vatican which provoked the controversy on which he thrives and left commentators agreeing that he had furthered his courtship of secessionists in northern Italy. The papal staff was left to ponder the effect of the visit on the church's reputation. A war of words between the visitor and Italy's leaders, and an anti-Haider protest outside the Vatican by several hundred leftwing demonstrators, reinforced immigration and national unity as issues in the run-up to the elections expected in the spring. On Saturday Mr Haider presented the Pope with an 24-metre fir tree from the Austrian province of Carinthia, of which he is governor. Near St Peter's Square 500 protesters threw cobblestones and tried to disrupt the ceremony. the police fired teargas at them before charging with batons. Thirty people were injured. Visibly relishing the attention, the guiding spirit of Austria's Freedom party stoked the furore with provocative statements about Jews and opponents during walkabouts in Rome which brought streets around him to a standstill. He said Italy was soft on immigration and he attacked the prime minister, Giuliano Amato, and President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi as weak men with weak, leftwing views. He said: \"I want to advise them to calm down, because I speak the truth: everyone knows that in Italy there is a growing problem of immigration and, at this moment, a very nervous climate over the next election. \"I repeat what I believe: everyone has a right to a dignified existence, but in their own country. Ever more people are thinking like I do.\" Opinion polls suggest that the centre-right opposition led by Silvio Berlusconi will win the election on a platform of increasing devolution and curbing immigration. An attempt by the opposition and the centre-left government to present a united front on the Haider visit crumbled into recrimination. \"The only one to have extracted advantage from the events of the Christmas tree in St Peter's Square appears to have been Haider,\" the Milan daily Corriere della Sera said. \"It was manna for him.\" Elements of Umberto Bossi's Northern League - which wants autonomy from Rome - are attracted by Mr Haider's suggestion of forming a region of Carinthia and bordering Italian areas. Mr Haider, who says he has started learning Italian, has made so many forays across the Alps to build alliances with mayors that Italy's government formally asked the Austrian chancellor to stop him. \u0095 Prosecutors say they will seek a three-year prison sentence on Cardinal Michele Giordano on charges of stealing church funds and loan-sharking.

Most of the files are about stolen cars, passports and other identity papers and property, but 1.3m are on individuals, of which 89% involve immigration rather than criminal cases.</p> <p>The system is the first experiment in large-scale, international sharing of sensitive data, and is at the heart of the EU's internal security system. Britain is due to take part in the policing side of the database within the next two years, and the Justice report argues that before long the government will also sign up to the immigration side.</p> <p>But the report, based on research in four EU countries, reveals that this database already suffers from significant defects in key data protection areas, including lack of clear standard criteria for making entries, with junior civil servants deciding who should be listed on it. There are also concerns over the poor quality of data and the obstacles placed in the way of individuals seeking to correct mistakes.</p> <p>Cases have emerged where people who have lost their passports have been banned from entering Europe because their names have been entered on the Schengen database after they have reported the loss. In the case of an Ethiopian citizen, it took eight months before the original German police officer who had entered his name on the Schengen database could be found to cancel the entry.</p> <p>The Justice report cites the case of a New Zealand woman who was refused entry to the Netherlands in June 1998 when she was trying to visit the Greenpeace headquarters in Amsterdam.</p> <p>In 1995, French authorities had listed her name as an unwanted alien to be refused entry, apparently because she was regarded as an activist who was a threat to public order and national security.</p> <p>The recent EU decisions to increase cooperation on immigration and crime means it is likely that this database will undergo rapid expansion as more countries join the EU.</p> <p>When Britain joins the policing side of the database, it is expected that only the national criminal intelligence service will have direct access, but in time this is expected to be extended to all police forces.</p> <p>At the end of last year, the database included the names of about 10,500 people wanted for extradition, 27,400 who had gone missing or were in need of protection, and 17,000 to be subjected to \"surveillance and checks\".</p> <p>Madeleine Colvin, Justice's legal policy consultant, said: \"As the Schengen information system is set to expand rapidly, the number of individuals whom it could potentially affect will be enormous. It is therefore an opportune time to start seriously debating the issues revealed in this report.</p> <p>\"As the UK government is making preparations to join the database, it is also in its interests to ensure that this takes place before going online.\"</p> <p>The Schengen information system, a human rights audit; from Justice, 59 Carter Lane, London EC4; \u00a315</p>",

Most of the files are about stolen cars, passports and other identity papers and property, but 1.3m are on individuals, of which 89% involve immigration rather than criminal cases. The system is the first experiment in large-scale, international sharing of sensitive data, and is at the heart of the EU's internal security system. Britain is due to take part in the policing side of the database within the next two years, and the Justice report argues that before long the government will also sign up to the immigration side. But the report, based on research in four EU countries, reveals that this database already suffers from significant defects in key data protection areas, including lack of clear standard criteria for making entries, with junior civil servants deciding who should be listed on it. There are also concerns over the poor quality of data and the obstacles placed in the way of individuals seeking to correct mistakes. Cases have emerged where people who have lost their passports have been banned from entering Europe because their names have been entered on the Schengen database after they have reported the loss. In the case of an Ethiopian citizen, it took eight months before the original German police officer who had entered his name on the Schengen database could be found to cancel the entry. The Justice report cites the case of a New Zealand woman who was refused entry to the Netherlands in June 1998 when she was trying to visit the Greenpeace headquarters in Amsterdam. In 1995, French authorities had listed her name as an unwanted alien to be refused entry, apparently because she was regarded as an activist who was a threat to public order and national security. The recent EU decisions to increase cooperation on immigration and crime means it is likely that this database will undergo rapid expansion as more countries join the EU. When Britain joins the policing side of the database, it is expected that only the national criminal intelligence service will have direct access, but in time this is expected to be extended to all police forces. At the end of last year, the database included the names of about 10,500 people wanted for extradition, 27,400 who had gone missing or were in need of protection, and 17,000 to be subjected to \"surveillance and checks\". Madeleine Colvin, Justice's legal policy consultant, said: \"As the Schengen information system is set to expand rapidly, the number of individuals whom it could potentially affect will be enormous. It is therefore an opportune time to start seriously debating the issues revealed in this report. \"As the UK government is making preparations to join the database, it is also in its interests to ensure that this takes place before going online.\" The Schengen information system, a human rights audit; from Justice, 59 Carter Lane, London EC4; \u00a315",

Showing a tactful awareness of revived regional pride the government has picked three towns representing very different civil circumstances - one in the service industry south, one in the industrially-beleaguered West Midlands, and the third, the gateway to the Highlands. The decision, which has been beset by a number of embarrassing hitches and delays not least a leaked memo from the Home Office which appeared to mock some of the 39 applications, was finally sanctioned by the Queen last week. It will disappoint claimants such as Milton Keynes, the ultra-modern new town, and much-mocked Reading, as well as Luton, the bookies' favourite. But in a week when William Hague has been accused of reviving the style of Enoch Powell, it will be especially welcome in Wolverhampton - \"always the bridesmaid to (nearby) Birmingham\". Since 1968 when the then Tory frontbencher made his notorious \"rivers of blood\" speech in the town he represented for 24 years, it has repeatedly faced difficulties in attracting major companies to invest there - or skilled ethnic minority members to work in its schools and hospitals. All that has now changed. In addition to revitalising its town centre and halving unemployment to 5.5%, despite manufacturing closures, Wolverhampton now boasts an integrated community. \"Wolverhampton deserves it for this alone,\" said one local figure.

The awarding of city status to the borough is unlikely to harm Labour's chances of holding on to the area's three parliamentary seats, all gained from the Conservatives at the last election. The real benefit of achieving city status is hard to quantify, but Colin Anderson, council leader in Sunderland, which became Britain's 58th city in 1992, said earlier this year that they had never looked back. \"We have even created 13,000 extra jobs and some of that is undoubtedly due to the prestige of becoming a city.\" Jack Straw, home secretary, announced in October 1998 that the Queen had expressed her intention to mark both the millennium and the 50th anniversary of her accession to the throne - her golden jubilee in 2002 - by grants of city status.

When it comes to maternity rights, parental leave and pay while taking time off to look after children, this country is and will remain a long way behind its neighbours.</p> <p>The trade secretary, Stephen Byers, is proposing modest changes to existing rights - things like extending the right to unpaid maternity leave to a year, or increasing the flat rate of statutory maternity pay, now \u00a360.20 per week. There are also limited rights to work reduced hours, for either or both parents, after having a child. These are balanced by ideas to help make the law and the administration of maternity pay simpler for employers and the possibility of exemptions for some small businesses.</p> <p>But Labour has made quite clear that not all of the proposals will be implemented.

      "bodyText": "Even if the options for making life easier for working parents contained in the government's recent green paper were all taken up, parents in the United Kingdom would still receive less help and protection at work than those in almost every other country in Europe. When it comes to maternity rights, parental leave and pay while taking time off to look after children, this country is and will remain a long way behind its neighbours. The trade secretary, Stephen Byers, is proposing modest changes to existing rights - things like extending the right to unpaid maternity leave to a year, or increasing the flat rate of statutory maternity pay, now \u00a360.20 per week. There are also limited rights to work reduced hours, for either or both parents, after having a child. These are balanced by ideas to help make the law and the administration of maternity pay simpler for employers and the possibility of exemptions for some small businesses. But Labour has made quite clear that not all of the proposals will be implemented. Employers, employees and other interested groups are invited to indicate their top three priorities on a list (they have until March to respond). To put the proposals in perspective, Sweden offers 450 days of paid leave per family, which can be taken all at once or used to reduce working hours.

      "bodyText": "Whitbread is battling to calm anger surrounding its restructuring, with rumours of further restaurant closures adding to a rebellion by pub landlords. The firm has said it intends to sell 140 restaurants, including some in its Cafe Rouge, Bella Pasta and Beefeater chains. Weekend reports suggested more than double this number would shut because they fail to meet chief executive David Thomas's yardstick of 5% growth in annual sales. The firm also faces an inquiry by trading standards officers in Luton into the disposal of its 3,000 pubs. Landlords claim the \"pub partnership\" scheme is misleading, and should offer them the right to buy. Gary McClure of the Old King's Head, Broughton-in-Furness, is leading the rebellion and claims to have the support of 800 fellow Whitbread licensees. The campaign has attracted the support of Conservative front-bencher Tim Collins and Labour MEP Brian Simpson. Activists fear that if the \u00a31.5bn pub estate is sold to an operator such as Punch Taverns or Nomura they could face an arbitrary increase in rent and a slimmer choice of drinks. A spokesman for Whitbread said licensees were being treated \"in the same way as any other interested parties\". However, he added: \"It remains true that we're looking to sell the pub business as a single entity.\"",

Henry worked under Tom Welsh, the first director, and then with Professor John Dodge, whose premature death in 1984 brought Henry into the role of acting director of journalism studies - a status he retained until Hugh Stephenson's appointment as professor of journalism in 1986. Henry retired in 1995 after steering numerous well-known bylines into their journalistic careers. He was also a founder member of the judging and selection committees for the annual James Cameron Award. Henry was born in Gillingham, Kent, into a committed Labour family, the eldest of three brothers, sons of Gordon Clother, the town's registrar. His mother was a teacher and a socialist. Henry stood unsuccessfully as a Labour candidate in four general elections, contesting Working, Canterbury and twice in Gillingham where he became a Labour councillor. He never married, though for the last 16 years of his life his close companion - albeit not his partner - was the distinguished broadcaster Margaret Howard. Henry Clother, journalist, teacher and activist, born January 9 1931; died December 11 2000",

      "bodyText": "Sarah Boseley's report (Doctors 'faking research work', December 13) highlights an important issue for the medical research community. In June 1998 I pointed out in the British Medical Journal that every case of fraud and misconduct reduces public confidence, abuses the use of public and charitable funds, and causes insult and frustration to the vast majority of careful, honest workers. The General Medical Council's guidance on what is expected of doctors in research is simple and clear and is circulated to every doctor on the register. This we enforce, taking action to remove or restrict doctors' registration in almost all cases where misconduct or fraud is proved. We will be publishing more detailed guidance on good research practice in 2001. But medical research is a multi-disciplinary activity involving other health care professionals and scientists. I agree that an independent body should be established to audit the procedures used in institutions to identify, investigate and prosecute fraud. However, this is not the role of the GMC. Sir Cyril Chantler GMC standards committee \u0095 You confuse the Academy of Medical Sciences with the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges. The latter coordinates the 18 royal colleges and faculties and is the voice of British medicine. It is untrue that the colleges have been \"especially negligent\" in promoting research integrity. We abhor all research fraud and are determined to stamp it out. One of our colleges has prepared a report recommending the establishment of a new national panel on research integrity.

      "bodyText": "Rioting against the government broke out in Harare at the weekend, heightening an already volatile atmosphere and the anger against President Robert Mugabe's leadership as the economic crisis deepens. The police fired teargas in the central shopping district to disperse the rioters on Saturday, creating panic among Christmas shoppers. The riot occurred just streets away from where delegates were leaving a congress of Mr Mugabe's Zanu-PF party. The congress reaffirmed Mr Mugabe as party leader and endorsed the continuation of his policies, despite the fact that they have brought fuel shortages, high unemployment and rising prices to the once prosperous country. \"Those Zanu-PF delegates must not fool themselves that everything is OK,\" said Mabel Mundando, a shopper who was caught in the disturbance. \"We want change, not more of the same, and that is what happened at the congress,\" she said. \"This riot shows that people are fed up and Zanu-PF is signing its own death warrant by sticking with Mugabe.\" There had been speculation that Mr Mugabe would be challenged at the congress, but he strengthened his control over the party. The 7,000 delegates were handpicked for loyalty and did not utter any criticism. Mr Mugabe dropped his chief critic, Eddison Zvobgo, from the ruling politburo and appointed several new members who support his policies. The riot erupted when the police tried to arrest a taxi driver and fired a shot which accidentally killed a woman vendor nearby. Furious shoppers chased the policeman into a store but he escaped through a back door. The crowd accused the shop owner of helping the police and, shouting anti-government slogans, they looted the shop and threw stones at the police. The scuffles lasted four hours and several people were arrested. The police erected roadblocks in Harare yesterday to keep a lid on the simmering unrest.",

My Best Friend's Wedding (PJ Hogan, 1997) 10pm, FilmFour Fun-filled modern take on the screwball comedy that saw Julia Roberts doing big box-office again. She's a cookery writer who realises, four days before her ex (Dermot Mulroney) is to marry Cameron Diaz, that she's still in love with him. Luckily her gay colleague (a very deft Rupert Everett) is on hand to pose as her beau, in order to make said ex jealous (look, it's not meant to make much sense. That's why it's screwball). Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas (Terry Gilliam, 1998) 12.30am, Sky Premier Hunter S Thompson's drug-fuelled quest in a crimson convertible for the American Dream was labelled the novel that could never be filmed, but this is a defiantly faithful adaptation. Gilliam, creator of fantasies from Jabberwocky to Twelve Monkeys, conjures astounding pharmaceutical hallucinations; and although the serial trashing of hotel rooms, the awesome soundtrack and Johnny Depp's jaded voiceover at times combine to numbing effect, there are exceptional performances from Depp as the Thompson alter ego Raoul Duke and Benicio Del Toro as his pal, Dr Gonzo.",

Miucca Prada's hugely successful Milan-based fashion company has announced a new investment in shops, offices and warehouses, designed by three distinctive, deeply fashionable architectural studios: Rem Koolhaas's OMA, in Rotterdam, Zurich's Herzog &amp; de Meuron and Tokyo's SANAA. Between them, these \"Pradarchitects\" are designing six buildings that are meant to \"reinvent the concept of shopping\". </p> <p>This is a tall order; it's more likely that what Prada will get from this select band of world-class architects is a number of cleverly thought-out shops with staying power as well as shock-of-the-new impact. Prada's existing shops, of which there are more than 100 worldwide, are already immediately recognisable, with their minty colours, crisp lines, playful graphics and entertaining clothes. </p> <p>As for Koolhaas, Herzog &amp; de Meuron and SANAA, they offer near-perfect architectural fetishism. The Swiss architects' conversion of Bankside power station into Tate Modern is, if you imagine its relentless bare walls painted pistachio, very Prada. As for Koolhaas, a clever, likeable self-promoter, the bumper book he made of his work and ideas in 1997 was designed by ultra-fashionable graphic designer Bruce Mau, and called, in playful homage to the fashion industry, SMLXL. </p> <p>And SANAA? Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa are currently at work on the new Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa, but earned international attention for the Japanese pavilion at last year's Venice architecture biennale. Their Japanese houses and museums suggest they should be able to give Prada's new beauty shops (within the new shops) the kind of serene qualities the smartest fashion, food and furniture stores are, with greater or lesser success, trying to create. </p> <p>The hi-tech, billion-dollar fashion odyssey began last year when Prada approached Koolhaas's OMA and his research outfit, AMO, to \"redefine the Prada shop experience\". So, what can we expect to see? First off, there will be new stores by Koolhaas's OMA in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. AMO, meanwhile, is designing the <a href=\"http://www.prada.com\">Prada</a> website which will be up and running in 2001. </p> <p>Judging from a model of Koolhaas's New York store, the interior will be rather like a theatre, which makes sense, as a visit to a Prada shop is a theatrical experience. It will also be a shrine to the apparently inexhaustible cult of what Marx called commodity fetishism. Herzog &amp; de Meuron is signed up for the new Prada headquarters in central Manhattan, a conversion due for completion in 2002. It is also at work on the construction of the Prada production centre at Terranuova, outside Milan, which should turn out to be a very stylish factory. </p> <p> There is nothing particularly new in all this, of course. In the past few years, those two accomplished minimalist architects Claudio Silvestrin and John Pawson have both designed fashion stores that feel like a fusion of monastic church and modern theatre. There is something deeply fetishistic about the idea of walking silently among the whitest-of-white walls hallowed by the latest little black creations of the world's most profitable fashion houses in an atmosphere more reverent than that of a Cistercian monastery. Pawson is currently designing a new Cistercian monastery; will the monks choose black again this year? </p> <p>Gradually, we are witnessing a merging of theatre, worship, fashion, architecture, design and shopping. Prada's choice of architects is wise: not only will they design a range of convincing shops with a shelf life of more than a season or two, but if an up-and-coming generation finally turns against the seductive creed of commodity fetishism, the shops will be readily convertible into places of worship, or theatres, at the very least.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The pioneers of German graphic design were heroes of the avant-garde. They were dadaists, expressionists, constructivists - they didn't paint safe watercolours, like Hitler. But it was Hitler who produced Germany's most famous trademark. </p> <p>Designers and Hitler thought the same way about logos. Jeremy Aynsley, in his new book Graphic Design in Germany 1890-1945, quotes the expressionist painter Johannes Molzahn: \"No organisation can exist and expand for long unless it uses such a device.\" Hitler had got there first, writing in Mein Kampf of the importance of an emblem to \"spark interest in a movement\". Of the Nazi flag and armbands, he boasted, \"I myself put down a final form ... a red flag with a black swastika in a white disc.\" </p> <p>In the confident style of a designer presenting a new corporate identity, Hitler explained how \"after many trials I arrived at a satisfactory relationship between the size of the white disc and the shape and weight of the swastika\". No mention of the fact that he had also cunningly sliced up and rearranged the black, white and red bands of the German imperial flag. \"As National Socialists, in our flag we see our policy. In red we see the movement's social thinking, in white the nationalist, in the swastika the fight for the victory of Aryan man ...\" </p> <p>The image of Aryan man was most consistently portrayed (sometimes with Aryan woman) by Ludwig Hohlwein. Established as a poster artist before the first world war, Hohlwein advertised high-class goods, national causes and right-wing movements. In June 1937 he reported to his wife: \"Yesterday a Herr Mau from the Office for Racial Politics in Berlin came to see me. We sat in our shirtsleeves in the studio from seven until after eight and settled painlessly on a really fine image for next year's Nazi Party race calendar.\" For Hohlwein this was just another commission. For young graphic designers, after the Nazis came to power in 1933, it was different. </p> <p>Germany had been impoverished by the first world war and the demands of the Versailles treaty. The country was swept by near-revolutions from the left and the right. There were political graphics in the street in every style, most using the visual rhetoric of cartoons. Many painters turned to graphic design in an attempt to find a social purpose for their activity, and a livelihood. Some looked forward to a pan-European cultural utopia, linking the Dutch ideas of abstraction with those of the Russian constructivists. They replaced drawn illustration with photographs and photomontage. They responded to industrialisation by making new rules for typography. Some abandoned capital letters to simplify typewriting and typesetting. </p> <p> Kurt Schwitters was one of several designers who produced a phonetic typeface. A key organiser of his progressive colleagues, Schwitters was typographic designer to the city of Hanover, producing stationery and official forms for every kind of municipal activity, from letterheads for the zoo to school timetables, all austerely modern. The brochures and publications that advertised the standardised fittings and furniture of the new housing estates shared their rationalising, hygienic functionalism. </p> <p>Hitler's attitude to modernism was ambivalent. On the one hand, he found an ally in new technology such the camera, posing for magazines in front of his silver Junkers aeroplane . Yet his hope to unite Germans - \"to harness the brain and the fist\" - excluded modernism. First, modernism was not Germanic, and worse, it had influences from Soviet Russia. But, while Hitler denounced the cubists, futurists, dadaists and so on as \"racially ill-founded and intolerable\", neither he nor the party gave a lead on graphic style. In posters, as in architecture, modernist, neoclassical and Teutonic tendencies co-existed. </p> <p>In 1935 the pages of Graphic News were filled with adverts for the new versions of the Gothic-looking, traditionally German, Fraktur style of typeface. It was the style that \"synchronised with the German language\". The readers of Graphic News were told that \"not only through its content, but also by its design\", print must play its part in \"raising the cultural level of the German people\". </p> <p>After Hitler became chancellor, designers had to register with the culture ministry. Indexes of art books can be found with the note: \"Jews are identified by an asterisk\". Permission to work was refused on political or racial grounds. All radicals were at risk. At best, their livelihoods were taken away. \"Protective custody\" was arranged for any who had links with progressive movements. </p> <p>The typographer Jan Tschichold had a visit from the stormtroopers while he was away lecturing. They asked his wife to \"open\" a Mondrian painting on the wall, mistaking it for the front of a safe. More dangerously, they found incriminating collages by Russian constructivists. Rather than wait for the party thugs, Tschichold surrendered himself to the police. After six weeks a policeman helped him get a passport so that he could leave for Switzerland. (Ten years later Tschichold was in charge of the design of Penguin Books in London.) </p> <p>In a letter to Tschichold's publisher the Gestapo wrote that \"for the protection of the German people\" all copies of one of his books were to be confiscated. \"In its general design and in its exclusive use of lower-case letters and the type of illustration, Photo-Eye exhibits a subversive tendency incompatible with the aspirations of the nationalist-socialist state.\" You could not avoid politics. Tschichold had been alarmed to find the majority of his students at the Munich printing school appearing in Nazi uniform. </p> <p>The staff in art schools and museums were replaced. Some of the former staff and students of the Bauhaus were able to work in Berlin. Mies van der Rohe, the director of the school before it was shut down by the Nazis, worked with Hitler's architect-in-chief, Albert Speer. Herbert Bayer, the most brilliant graphic designer of the Bauhaus staff, designed catalogues for state exhibitions that included nationalist propaganda. Mies and Bayer left for the US in 1938, several years after many had fled. </p> <p>Among those who took their chance early were Hans Leistikow, who had worked on the team of designers replanning Frankfurt. He went to the Soviet Union in 1930. When Stalin turned foreign specialists out of Russia in 1937 he was lucky to find work with a pharmaceutical firm in Berlin, and survived defending the city in 1945. </p> <p>Schwitters left for Norway and was interned on the Isle of Man for more than a year. He died in Ambleside in 1948. Designers who were also painters had their work exhibited as \"degenerate\". Some, such as Willi Baumeister, arranged exhibitions abroad so that work would survive. The Nazis, who in 1933 had organised public book-burnings, in 1939 set fire to 5,000 confiscated items of painting and sculpture. </p> <p>Molzahn's painting was classified as \"degenerate\". Hohlwein's studio in Munich was devastated by an Allied bomb. While he ended his career doing posters for the US forces in Berchtesgaden, his younger colleagues were in the US. Driven by the scourge of the swastika, they were helping to establish corporate modernism.</p> <p>\u0095 Graphic Design in Germany 1890-1945 by Jeremy Aynsley is published by Thames and Hudson at \u00a336.

In June 1937 he reported to his wife: \"Yesterday a Herr Mau from the Office for Racial Politics in Berlin came to see me. We sat in our shirtsleeves in the studio from seven until after eight and settled painlessly on a really fine image for next year's Nazi Party race calendar.\" For Hohlwein this was just another commission. For young graphic designers, after the Nazis came to power in 1933, it was different. Germany had been impoverished by the first world war and the demands of the Versailles treaty. The country was swept by near-revolutions from the left and the right. There were political graphics in the street in every style, most using the visual rhetoric of cartoons. Many painters turned to graphic design in an attempt to find a social purpose for their activity, and a livelihood. Some looked forward to a pan-European cultural utopia, linking the Dutch ideas of abstraction with those of the Russian constructivists. They replaced drawn illustration with photographs and photomontage. They responded to industrialisation by making new rules for typography. Some abandoned capital letters to simplify typewriting and typesetting. Kurt Schwitters was one of several designers who produced a phonetic typeface. A key organiser of his progressive colleagues, Schwitters was typographic designer to the city of Hanover, producing stationery and official forms for every kind of municipal activity, from letterheads for the zoo to school timetables, all austerely modern. The brochures and publications that advertised the standardised fittings and furniture of the new housing estates shared their rationalising, hygienic functionalism. Hitler's attitude to modernism was ambivalent. On the one hand, he found an ally in new technology such the camera, posing for magazines in front of his silver Junkers aeroplane . Yet his hope to unite Germans - \"to harness the brain and the fist\" - excluded modernism. First, modernism was not Germanic, and worse, it had influences from Soviet Russia. But, while Hitler denounced the cubists, futurists, dadaists and so on as \"racially ill-founded and intolerable\", neither he nor the party gave a lead on graphic style. In posters, as in architecture, modernist, neoclassical and Teutonic tendencies co-existed. In 1935 the pages of Graphic News were filled with adverts for the new versions of the Gothic-looking, traditionally German, Fraktur style of typeface. It was the style that \"synchronised with the German language\". The readers of Graphic News were told that \"not only through its content, but also by its design\", print must play its part in \"raising the cultural level of the German people\". After Hitler became chancellor, designers had to register with the culture ministry. Indexes of art books can be found with the note: \"Jews are identified by an asterisk\". Permission to work was refused on political or racial grounds. All radicals were at risk. At best, their livelihoods were taken away. \"Protective custody\" was arranged for any who had links with progressive movements. The typographer Jan Tschichold had a visit from the stormtroopers while he was away lecturing. They asked his wife to \"open\" a Mondrian painting on the wall, mistaking it for the front of a safe. More dangerously, they found incriminating collages by Russian constructivists. Rather than wait for the party thugs, Tschichold surrendered himself to the police. After six weeks a policeman helped him get a passport so that he could leave for Switzerland. (Ten years later Tschichold was in charge of the design of Penguin Books in London.) In a letter to Tschichold's publisher the Gestapo wrote that \"for the protection of the German people\" all copies of one of his books were to be confiscated. \"In its general design and in its exclusive use of lower-case letters and the type of illustration, Photo-Eye exhibits a subversive tendency incompatible with the aspirations of the nationalist-socialist state.\" You could not avoid politics. Tschichold had been alarmed to find the majority of his students at the Munich printing school appearing in Nazi uniform. The staff in art schools and museums were replaced. Some of the former staff and students of the Bauhaus were able to work in Berlin. Mies van der Rohe, the director of the school before it was shut down by the Nazis, worked with Hitler's architect-in-chief, Albert Speer. Herbert Bayer, the most brilliant graphic designer of the Bauhaus staff, designed catalogues for state exhibitions that included nationalist propaganda. Mies and Bayer left for the US in 1938, several years after many had fled. Among those who took their chance early were Hans Leistikow, who had worked on the team of designers replanning Frankfurt. He went to the Soviet Union in 1930. When Stalin turned foreign specialists out of Russia in 1937 he was lucky to find work with a pharmaceutical firm in Berlin, and survived defending the city in 1945. Schwitters left for Norway and was interned on the Isle of Man for more than a year. He died in Ambleside in 1948. Designers who were also painters had their work exhibited as \"degenerate\". Some, such as Willi Baumeister, arranged exhibitions abroad so that work would survive. The Nazis, who in 1933 had organised public book-burnings, in 1939 set fire to 5,000 confiscated items of painting and sculpture. Molzahn's painting was classified as \"degenerate\". Hohlwein's studio in Munich was devastated by an Allied bomb. While he ended his career doing posters for the US forces in Berchtesgaden, his younger colleagues were in the US. Driven by the scourge of the swastika, they were helping to establish corporate modernism. \u0095 Graphic Design in Germany 1890-1945 by Jeremy Aynsley is published by Thames and Hudson at \u00a336.

      "body": "<p>Government hopes of reaping huge savings in legal aid by diverting divorcing couples away from lawyers and into mediation services have been dashed by the results of two large-scale research projects to be published this week.</p> <p>The Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine, is expected to use their publication to announce a government decision, taken months ago and revealed by the Guardian, not to go ahead with no-fault divorce laws which were passed by parliament in 1996.</p> <p>Part II of the Family Law Act 1996 abolished the need to prove adultery or unreasonable behaviour to obtain a divorce in less than two years. But the measure proved controversial in its parliamentary passage, and concessions were made to \"moral majority\" peers and MPs.</p> <p>While abolishing fault, the act would have ended quickie divorces and made couples wait at least a year, and 18 months if there were children, to end their marriages.</p> <p>Ministers feared the act would be unpopular with voters once they learned they would have to wait longer to divorce. It was also clear from preliminary research that the hoped-for savings from mediation would not materialise.</p> <p>But ministers were concerned that they could be seen as disregarding the will of parliament if they announced it had been permanently shelved.</p> <p>The Lord Chancellor has been under pressure for more than a year from his own advisory board on family law, which said it was \"surprised and disappointed\" when he announced in June 1999 that the reforms would not be brought into force this year, and that no decision would be made until after the results of a pilot study into compulsory \"information meetings\" for those contemplating divorce.</p> <p>That study, by Janet Walker of Newcastle University, is one of the two published this week, but the decision not to go ahead with no-fault divorce or the information meetings was taken months ago.</p> <p>The decision will be a blow to the advisory board, which described the current law as \"widely discredited\". The Lord Chancellor is expected to announce instead extra measures to strengthen marriage, and an enhanced role for marriage registrars in counselling couples to reflect longer before embarking on matrimony.</p> <p>Professor Walker's \u00a31m research showed that information meetings, intended partly to encourage couples to opt for mediation, instead focused their attention on the need for legal advice. It has been estimated that providing information meetings for all divorcing couples would cost \u00a340m to \u00a350m a year.</p> <p>A pilot studies of mediation where at least one of the spouses is eligible for legal aid found that only a small minority of couples went through the mediation process.</p> <p>Ministers hoped a rule requiring anyone applying for legal aid for divorce to be assessed first for suitability for mediation would produce a big saving in the legal aid bill. But mediation requires the cooperation and few couples went through the process.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Government hopes of reaping huge savings in legal aid by diverting divorcing couples away from lawyers and into mediation services have been dashed by the results of two large-scale research projects to be published this week. The Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine, is expected to use their publication to announce a government decision, taken months ago and revealed by the Guardian, not to go ahead with no-fault divorce laws which were passed by parliament in 1996. Part II of the Family Law Act 1996 abolished the need to prove adultery or unreasonable behaviour to obtain a divorce in less than two years. But the measure proved controversial in its parliamentary passage, and concessions were made to \"moral majority\" peers and MPs. While abolishing fault, the act would have ended quickie divorces and made couples wait at least a year, and 18 months if there were children, to end their marriages. Ministers feared the act would be unpopular with voters once they learned they would have to wait longer to divorce. It was also clear from preliminary research that the hoped-for savings from mediation would not materialise. But ministers were concerned that they could be seen as disregarding the will of parliament if they announced it had been permanently shelved. The Lord Chancellor has been under pressure for more than a year from his own advisory board on family law, which said it was \"surprised and disappointed\" when he announced in June 1999 that the reforms would not be brought into force this year, and that no decision would be made until after the results of a pilot study into compulsory \"information meetings\" for those contemplating divorce. That study, by Janet Walker of Newcastle University, is one of the two published this week, but the decision not to go ahead with no-fault divorce or the information meetings was taken months ago. The decision will be a blow to the advisory board, which described the current law as \"widely discredited\". The Lord Chancellor is expected to announce instead extra measures to strengthen marriage, and an enhanced role for marriage registrars in counselling couples to reflect longer before embarking on matrimony. Professor Walker's \u00a31m research showed that information meetings, intended partly to encourage couples to opt for mediation, instead focused their attention on the need for legal advice. It has been estimated that providing information meetings for all divorcing couples would cost \u00a340m to \u00a350m a year. A pilot studies of mediation where at least one of the spouses is eligible for legal aid found that only a small minority of couples went through the mediation process. Ministers hoped a rule requiring anyone applying for legal aid for divorce to be assessed first for suitability for mediation would produce a big saving in the legal aid bill. But mediation requires the cooperation and few couples went through the process.",

      "body": "<p>It wasn't, said the first BBC man I talked to, \"very exciting\". Probably not. Fudge and sucked thumbs aren't, in that sense, exciting. Words like \"modern\" and \"intelligent\" and \"diversity\" are the sleeping tablets of New Labourese. But beware: bromides like Chris Smith's communications white paper can damage your intellectual health. </p> <p>There will, after the next election, be a new regulator called Ofcom (as in Ofwat and Oftel). It will subsume the independent television commission and the broadcasting standards council and the radio authority (and the radiocommunications agency and Oftel as well) into one giant maw. Only the BBC governors, mopping their brows, will stand slightly to one side (though they, too, may find themselves at the end of a silken rope). </p> <p>Does anybody involved care or sound an alarm? Silence. Radio stations and newspapers might wish that takeovers were easier, Granada might hanker after getting together with Carlton, but Ofcom itself slips down as though it were a spoonful of sugar. Joined-up regulation and, better still, \"light touch\". The supervisor of self-regulation rather than the imposer of central solutions. It is your cuddly new chum bringing order to the chaos of digital this and broadband that; a jolly, greenish giant. </p> <p>Yet turn, by way of test, to section 6:3 of Mr Smith's hymn to plurality. There will be \"high-level objectives\" for Ofcom to pursue. I quote just two of them: to ensure the protection of children, and to maintain generally accepted community standards. How will that be done? By the \"drawing-up of detailed rules\" according to clear principles. Here are some of those \"principles\". The likely degree of harm/offence. The extent of choice about access, including any likelihood of accidental access. The need to avoid unfairness and unwarranted intrusiveness. The desirability of maintaining accuracy and impartiality in communications services. </p> <p>Motherhood and apple pie? Not exactly - for, in a wittering dissertation on technological change, the white paper discovers that \"some new personal video recorders automatically record programmes of genres previously watched, making it even more possible that late-night programmes could be in the video when children get up for their morning cartoons\". Holy creeping watersheds! </p> <p>Which leads, naturally, to consideration of all videos, DVDs and computer games - and to the prospective fate awaiting the British board of film classification. There sits my old friend Andreas Whittam Smith, slapping his 12 or 15 or 18 ratings on movies and snipping rather harder when those films hit the video stalls. He does a good, arm's-length job. But will he be able to do it much longer? </p> <p>There is, apparently, \"an argument that the suitability of material should be made on a more consistent and coherent basis across the media\". Maybe the BBFC will remain as now \"within the framework of statutory principles\". (See how swiftly light touch turns statutory?) Maybe Ofcom might hire Andreas to vet films on TV and the net and computer games. Or \"another possible approach would be for Ofcom to take over the pre-classification work of the BBFC\". </p> <p>After the creeping watershed, the creeping mission. Suddenly Ofcom isn't a sleeping giant. It is the court of first and last resort, hacking chunks out of movies that it deems may not \"uphold accepted community standards\". Suddenly the logic of \"consistency\" means that it must stand in the front line as an all-enveloping arbiter of public taste. </p> <p> The point about diversity is that it is diverse - as diverse as a future with 200 TV channels flowing into your home and entertainment on demand.

      "bodyText": "It wasn't, said the first BBC man I talked to, \"very exciting\". Probably not. Fudge and sucked thumbs aren't, in that sense, exciting. Words like \"modern\" and \"intelligent\" and \"diversity\" are the sleeping tablets of New Labourese. But beware: bromides like Chris Smith's communications white paper can damage your intellectual health. There will, after the next election, be a new regulator called Ofcom (as in Ofwat and Oftel). It will subsume the independent television commission and the broadcasting standards council and the radio authority (and the radiocommunications agency and Oftel as well) into one giant maw. Only the BBC governors, mopping their brows, will stand slightly to one side (though they, too, may find themselves at the end of a silken rope). Does anybody involved care or sound an alarm? Silence. Radio stations and newspapers might wish that takeovers were easier, Granada might hanker after getting together with Carlton, but Ofcom itself slips down as though it were a spoonful of sugar. Joined-up regulation and, better still, \"light touch\". The supervisor of self-regulation rather than the imposer of central solutions. It is your cuddly new chum bringing order to the chaos of digital this and broadband that; a jolly, greenish giant. Yet turn, by way of test, to section 6:3 of Mr Smith's hymn to plurality. There will be \"high-level objectives\" for Ofcom to pursue. I quote just two of them: to ensure the protection of children, and to maintain generally accepted community standards. How will that be done? By the \"drawing-up of detailed rules\" according to clear principles. Here are some of those \"principles\". The likely degree of harm/offence. The extent of choice about access, including any likelihood of accidental access. The need to avoid unfairness and unwarranted intrusiveness. The desirability of maintaining accuracy and impartiality in communications services. Motherhood and apple pie? Not exactly - for, in a wittering dissertation on technological change, the white paper discovers that \"some new personal video recorders automatically record programmes of genres previously watched, making it even more possible that late-night programmes could be in the video when children get up for their morning cartoons\". Holy creeping watersheds! Which leads, naturally, to consideration of all videos, DVDs and computer games - and to the prospective fate awaiting the British board of film classification. There sits my old friend Andreas Whittam Smith, slapping his 12 or 15 or 18 ratings on movies and snipping rather harder when those films hit the video stalls. He does a good, arm's-length job. But will he be able to do it much longer? There is, apparently, \"an argument that the suitability of material should be made on a more consistent and coherent basis across the media\". Maybe the BBFC will remain as now \"within the framework of statutory principles\". (See how swiftly light touch turns statutory?) Maybe Ofcom might hire Andreas to vet films on TV and the net and computer games. Or \"another possible approach would be for Ofcom to take over the pre-classification work of the BBFC\". After the creeping watershed, the creeping mission. Suddenly Ofcom isn't a sleeping giant. It is the court of first and last resort, hacking chunks out of movies that it deems may not \"uphold accepted community standards\". Suddenly the logic of \"consistency\" means that it must stand in the front line as an all-enveloping arbiter of public taste. The point about diversity is that it is diverse - as diverse as a future with 200 TV channels flowing into your home and entertainment on demand. There's the essential technological and emotional change, a permit to be different. But can governments - or their bouncing regulatory babies - come to terms with that change? Mr Smith tries. He thinks he wants labellings and warnings rather than bannings. Yet, crucially, he can't abandon his ancestral attachment to pre-censorship and control on a wider scale - and that's telling, because it is in the nature of the Ofcom beast.

Hot on the heels of ENO's attempts to stage the soundtrack of La Strada and to turn Rossini's The Turk in Italy into Eight and a Half, we now have a third Fellinian operatic take, in the form of Moshe Leiser's and Patrice Caurier's production of his Cenerentola at Covent Garden. </p> <p>With its blend of gritty neo-realism and semi-surreal magic, much of the piece suits opera well, and the mock 1950s designs are to die for.

Cenerentola is the heiress forced into drudgery while the rest of her odious family run through her money. Prince Ramiro and his valet Dandini fool everyone by exchanging roles and social status. Leiser and Caurier are often both up-front and un-funny about the nastiness of it all: Cenerentola's stepfather Magnifico is a vicious sadist who violently abuses the girl in scenes that are painful to watch. </p> <p>Her two sisters are man-eating slappers, avid for the cameras of the paparazzi, and attacking Dandini with crotch-grabbing voracity. The casting is impressive, visually as well as vocally. Sonia Ganassi's Cenerentola has much of Giulietta Masina's unforgettable, haunted beauty. Marcin Bronikowski's Dandini (closer in looks to Farley Granger in Visconti's Senso than to anyone in Fellini) exudes a charismatically glitzy sexuality that far exceeds that of Juan Diego Florez's elegant Prince. The ending is disquieting, hinting that the abuse heaped on Cenerentola will have a detrimental effect long after she's seemingly found true love and achieved an apparent reconciliation with her persecutors. </p> <p>The directors do, however, make one big mistake. Rossini ditches all trace of the supernatural, replacing fairy godmothers and the like with a worldly-wise old philosopher called Alidoro. Leiser and Caurier awkwardly try to restore the enchantment, turning Michele Pertusi's Alidoro into a guardian angel who sprouts gold wings, effects hi-tech scene changes, and magically conjures up a blue Bugatti in which our Cinders can go to the ball. Some of this is great fun, but it pulls the production two ways, blunting its focus. </p> <p>Musically, things take their cues from the staging's unsettling tone. Mark Elder conducts a performance that is second to none in brilliance and precision. But, in place of comic sparkle, we have a thoughtful darkness of tone, a slightly edgy intensity. Ganassi's voice is deep and rich, like purple velvet, plangently lyrical, occasionally moving with less than the requisite fluency at speed. Florez, in superlative voice, flings out top Cs and coloratura with alarming ease, bringing the house down in the process, while Bronikowski is all mercurial wit and seditious charm.

      "body": "<p>Two guys in the row in front went scrabbling for their mobile phones the moment \"the Quo\" launched into Whatever You Want. You could understand their excitement - it's not every day you get to hear the music from Argos's Christmas TV advert played live. But they weren't phoning pals to share this seminal moment of fusion between rock music, cut-price garden furniture and power tools. Instead, they lit up their phones, held them aloft candle-fashion and swayed emotionally - in ecstasy, no doubt, at the thought of all those great bargains. </p> <p>It was good to have a diversion. Status Quo may have been going for four decades but they don't seem to have picked up much in the way of stagecraft. Playing a set that had all the visual panache of a bus-stop, the super-annuated rockers kicked off with Caroline, The Wanderer, then Something 'Bout You Baby I Like. By that stage - gagging for something more stimulating than the remorseless diet of guitars going chung-ka, chung-ka, chung-ka, chung - you realise the importance of white trainers to the band.

You could understand their excitement - it's not every day you get to hear the music from Argos's Christmas TV advert played live. But they weren't phoning pals to share this seminal moment of fusion between rock music, cut-price garden furniture and power tools. Instead, they lit up their phones, held them aloft candle-fashion and swayed emotionally - in ecstasy, no doubt, at the thought of all those great bargains. It was good to have a diversion. Status Quo may have been going for four decades but they don't seem to have picked up much in the way of stagecraft. Playing a set that had all the visual panache of a bus-stop, the super-annuated rockers kicked off with Caroline, The Wanderer, then Something 'Bout You Baby I Like. By that stage - gagging for something more stimulating than the remorseless diet of guitars going chung-ka, chung-ka, chung-ka, chung - you realise the importance of white trainers to the band. They're the only \"visual\" they really have. Madonna traverses stages like a cross between a bullet and a ballet dancer. Ozzy Osbourne bites the heads off bats. But the Quo wear old denims and stick to a sort of pared-down hokey cokey: left leg in, left leg out, with the occasional heel-spin or mini-leap. If it wasn't for the white trainers, much of the impact of such pyrotechnics would be lost. So on the band rollicked, with a shuffle here and a shuffle there, carrying the crowd along: Down, Down, Roll Over Lay Down and In the Army Now, that strange and unexpected outburst of social conscience that, if nothing else, at least brought a change of pace before a Chas'n'Dave-style blast on the synthesisers propelled us into Rockin' All Over the World. It was a performance devoid of surprises but then that's kind of the point with Quo. They are to rock what Sunny Delight is to fruit juice: insipid in large doses, offering little in the way of \"the real thing\", but still hugely popular. You can knock the big songs all you want but they do have an anthem-like ability to stick around, rather like a bit of old chewing gum. From time to time amid the barrage of 12-bar blues, Francis Rossi (the band's waistcoat-wearing frontman) would stop to talk - an exercise that seemed designed to show that a man can spend his life addressing giant crowds and still not develop the gift of the gab. \"Put that sheep down!\" he said at one point, bafflingly, before going on to reveal: \"Our drummer's an alien!\" And the near-capacity crowd lapped it up.

      "bodyText": "The era of unmetered internet access all day and every day is nearly upon us. Internet service provider BTinternet, will offer existing customers unlimited surfing time for \u00a314.99 a month from January. Alternatively, they can have unlimited net access during the evenings and weekends for \u00a39.99 a month. New customers will have to wait until early April to take advantage of the deal. BTinternet said it would be impossible to cope with demand if the offer was made freely available straight away. But, by April, Oftel has told BT its network must be open to rivals who want to offer their own unmetered access packages. As such, the month is likely to herald a flood of offers, all claiming to be the best value on the market. The issue of how to reduce your internet bill is a complex one, and one that is likely to get more complicated with more competition in the market. Great as BTinternet's \u00a314.99 a month package sounds, its customers could save more money with its other packages. The \u00a314.99 would buy you 25 evening and weekend hours through BTinternet's pay-as-you-go service, which will charge these calls at 1p a minute. Alternatively, it would buy you 12.5 daytime hours, charged at 2p a minute. Whether an unmetered package is for you is an entirely personal matter. It all depends on how much you use the net. And the only way to find out how much you use the net and which package would be the best is to slave over phone bills and access deals for a few hours. And you thought technology was supposed to make life easier?",

The company, um, kind of come with you.\" An interval that isn't an interval, the dissolving of boundary between audience and theatrical spectacle, a deliberate, joyful haziness about traditional concepts other theatre companies cling to: all this is par for the course with Suspect Culture. So, too, is a commitment to their local, Scottish context which is blended with a passionate interest in internationalism. They also have a thing about tackling texts that don't exactly scream theatrical adaptation. </p> <p>Earlier this year, their Candide 2000 brought Voltaire to a shopping centre. Now, just as audaciously, they bring the Roman novel by Apuleius - a scathing satire written at the height of the Roman Empire - to modern Glasgow via Italy and Brazil. The result is theatre as it should be: a physical and intellectual thrill, a challenge and, at times, a puzzle. Our narrator Lucius (Sergio Romano) is a storyteller and magician who will give us \"a good history\" if we will part with our change. He tells tales of magical realism, of transformation and madness, while a member of the audience is pulled up to stand guard over a corpse by keeping a torchlight shining on it. </p> <p>As if all this isn't strange enough, Lucius speaks only in Portuguese, although he is Italian. A Brazilian woman, dressed in tartan, translates. That is just the first half. In the interval, Lucius leads us through the theatre, telling a love story without translation simply by pointing at paintings on walls. Somehow, we are all rapt. </p> <p>But, at this moment, Lucius is turned into an ass for dabbling with magical powers he doesn't understand. Transformed from a spinner of tales to a beast silent except for donkey-talk, he runs from the place and is brought back in by a troupe of Glasgwegians, some sympathetic, some mocking. And so begins the present-day, local aspect to the production, with non-professional actors from the Gorbals headbutted by Lucius until they tell their tales. </p> <p>Poverty, crime, lack of power, consumerism - this is what they talk of. Damilola Taylor's mother and father are quoted, his death re-enacted. As a sort of chorus between stories, they shop until they literally drop: walking between a box of brand names, a bottle of coke, a Barbie doll and a mobile phone. Stirring music plays and, inexplicably, a man starts doing Rolf Harris-style paintings on the back wall. It is a very Suspect Culture moment: ideas swirling around into some new meaning, local and international brought together. </p> <p>My only reservation is that the two parts - thrillingly magical storytelling and then Glaswegians talking about misery - still feel worlds apart. Each half could stand alone and so, too, could that puzzling interval. For the satire to really bite, they need to be speaking to each other more. </p> <p>Until Saturday.
