But the Swede's indecision allows the Spanish defence to clear for a corner from which Keown heads over. At the other end Conceicao loops a header just over Seaman's bar<br> <strong>22</strong> Bergkamp's tenacity wins Arsenal a corner on the left which he takes himself but this time the ball sails harmlessly over.

A warning shot for Arsenal<br> <strong>29 Goal: 2-0 Arsenal</strong> Bergkamp and Henry are beginning to pull the strings for the Gunners, and after one attack is repelled Arsenal come straight back at the Spaniards, Bergkamp rolling the ball into the path of Overmars on the right and his low, first-time cross is tucked away at the near post by Henry who has timed his run to perfection.

There's a general ruckus involving several players, Grimandi picks up a yellow card for the foul but for the Brazilian Djalminha it's not a second yellow card but a straight red. A bit harsh, but a stroke of luck for the Gooners.<br> <strong>65 Arsenal Substitution:</strong> Kanu for Overmars. <br> <strong>66 Goal Arsenal 3-1</strong> The lanky Nigerian wastes no time in making his presence felt, winning a free-kick on the right-angle of the Deportivo penalty area.

But do not blame it on malice or myopia - no human can give the right offside decision all the time. </p> <p>The Dutch researchers mounted cameras on an apartment block next to a pitch and monitored 200 potential offside situations in matches between two elite youth teams. They found that even professional assistant referees made mistakes at least 40 times because of a problem with the human perceptual system. </p> <p>In soccer, a player is offside if he is closer to the goal than the last defender (apart from the hapless goalkeeper) when the ball is passed. The team from the faculty of human movement at the free university of Amsterdam considered the challenge for the linesman. </p> <p>\"One explanation for these errors is that the assistant referee cannot see passer and receiver simultaneously,\" Raoul Oudejans and his colleagues write in Nature today. \"This causes the assistant referee to shift his gaze from passer to receiver and so make judgments a split second after the moment of passing - long enough for the receiver to have gone past the last defender and to appear offside.\" </p> <p>Dr Oudejans and his team then scrutinised 200 videotaped matches from five national competitions between 1996 and 1998, as well as the 1998 World Cup. The thesis held good. Tim Radford</p>",

      "bodyText": "Six scientists have proved what every disgruntled football fan knows: the linesman does get it wrong. But do not blame it on malice or myopia - no human can give the right offside decision all the time. The Dutch researchers mounted cameras on an apartment block next to a pitch and monitored 200 potential offside situations in matches between two elite youth teams. They found that even professional assistant referees made mistakes at least 40 times because of a problem with the human perceptual system. In soccer, a player is offside if he is closer to the goal than the last defender (apart from the hapless goalkeeper) when the ball is passed. The team from the faculty of human movement at the free university of Amsterdam considered the challenge for the linesman. \"One explanation for these errors is that the assistant referee cannot see passer and receiver simultaneously,\" Raoul Oudejans and his colleagues write in Nature today. \"This causes the assistant referee to shift his gaze from passer to receiver and so make judgments a split second after the moment of passing - long enough for the receiver to have gone past the last defender and to appear offside.\" Dr Oudejans and his team then scrutinised 200 videotaped matches from five national competitions between 1996 and 1998, as well as the 1998 World Cup. The thesis held good. Tim Radford",

Hopefully I can do the job for them,\" he said. \"I haven't seen my contract yet so I don't know how it's going to work with it being a new experiment.\" As for Thorpe, he has been a complacent Test cricketer for several years but appears to have burnt his bridges not so much by opting out of the tour but by not revealing his intentions until the final day of the last Test against New Zealand shortly before the party for South Africa was selected. \"It was his decision,\" said Graveney, \"and there are implications from that. He has not gone to the back of the queue but an opportunity has been given to others now.\"",

French and British actresses Catherine Deneuve and Jacqueline Bisset as well as film diva Claudia Cardinale are among scores of personalities who have said they could not be seen to be rubbing shoulders with the new government members. Several stars who will attend tonight have employed bodyguards to ensure that they are not photographed with populist politician J\u00f6rg Haider, who until days ago was the leader of the far-right Freedom party which entered into a coalition with the conservative People's party under the chancellorship of Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel almost a month ago. Portuguese president Jorge Sampaio, whose country holds the European Union presidency, was billed as the guest of honour until cancelling his visit when the new government was sworn in. Austria has found itself increasingly isolated since European Union leaders announced a collective boycott against it early last month.

The guests of honour are now expected to be the president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbajev, who will share a 200,000 schilling (\u00a39,090) box with Austrian president Thomas Klestil, and Sudanese-born beauty Nadja Abdel Farrag, the presenter of the late-night German TV programme, Peep!, which is based on voyeuristic sex. She is to appear on the arm of Viennese building magnate, Richard Lugner, who in the past has drawn huge publicity by escorting the likes of the Duchess of York, Sophia Loren and Ivana Trump to the prestigious event.

      "body": "<p> At the end of 1998, the British 'New Labour' Government had something of a crisis: two Cabinet ministers resigned in the face of accusations of financial impropriety. The worst blow was the loss of Peter Mandelson, the Minister for Trade and Industry, one of the chief architects of New Labour and of its electoral victory, and one of the closest allies of the Prime Minister, Tony Blair. Mandelson's departure led to intense speculation over a shift in direction on the part of the Government; in one formulation at the time: a move towards rather less of the 'new' and more of the 'Labour'.The Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott was widely interpreted as advocating such a shift. This was the interpretation which was for instance put on an interview he gave to the Independent, in which he said 'we need to get away from rhetoric and back on to the substance of government'. That statement apparently constituted the basis for the Independent's headline: 'Prescott bins the spin for real policies'. 'The spin' is an allusion to New Labour's 'spin-doctors', the people responsible for the media presentation of the Government and for putting a media 'spin' (or angle) on its policies and activities. Media communications are more carefully handled and more centrally controlled by the New Labour Government than any previous British government, and the Government has been accused by its critics of governing by media spin. Mandelson himself had overall responsibility for media communications as the Minister without Portfolio before he was shifted to the Department of Trade and Industry. He was closely associated with New Labour's reputation for being preoccupied with spin, and credited with being the spin-doctor par excellence. </p> <p>John Prescott was interviewed on the BBC Radio 4 'Today' programme a few days after the interview in the Independent. He was at pains on that occasion to deny that there were any major divisions over policy or strategy within the Government. Indeed he returned to the contrast between 'rhetoric' and 'substance', but used it to set the Government against the press - given the manifesto undertakings it has implemented, the Government 'is a government of substance, of traditional values in a modern setting', it is the press that 'are not really interested in that substance', that go in for 'rhetoric'. But 'rhetoric' seems quite an appropriate way of describing what Prescott is doing here: having taken the opportunity of Mandelson's resignation (as well as Blair's absence abroad on holiday) to publicly air divisions within the Government and to take a position, he neatly relocates the 'rhetoric versus substance' issue as a criticism not of the Government but of the press. If politicians are to successfully pursue internal divisions in public in contemporary mediatised politics, they need the sort of skills Prescott is manifesting in this case: being able to venture a criticism in a sufficiently ambivalent way that one can draw back from it if challenged without bringing into question the unity of the Government or Party or one's own loyalty. </p> <p>This is how the interviewer, Jim Naughtie, responded to Prescott: </p> <p> You've made your point very clearly. The point though is that the way that people in government talk about these things is important, you'd acknowledge that. Indeed it was Mr Mandelson's credo that the way you talked about things, they way you used language was very important, because it sent out messages. And you don't need to be told that a lot of Labour MPs - when they saw what you were saying, the language you were using, 'traditional values' albeit 'in a modern setting' - were saying: 'Look, here at last is a little more of the stuff we want to hear. He doesn't talk about 'The Project' doesn't talk about 'New Labour', he talks about 'Labour' .' </p> <p>And Prescott's answer was: </p> <p>Yes but then that is presented as a kind of great division. It's not a division because I'm pointing out to you the things that every one of us support \u00db. the traditional values in a modern setting, what I'm saying is perhaps we should emphasize it a great deal more. </p> <p>Naughtie is combining, perhaps confusing, two issues. One is the issue of what 'messages' politicians convey to one another through shifts of language - one way of seeing politics is as an ongoing struggle to achieve dominance of one political position over others which is partly enacted as a struggle for the dominance of political language, a struggle for instance to win acceptance for formulations like 'traditional values in a modern setting' rather than the 'Third Way', or 'Labour' rather than 'New Labour'. Naughtie is suggesting that this is what Prescott was doing in the interview, but Prescott rejects the implication of a division within New Labour: the question is only how much 'emphasis' is given to parts of what he implies is a shared language. Again, Prescott seems to be rhetorically covering over internal differences. </p> <p>The second issue is the perception very much associated with Peter Mandelson that the language which politicians use 'sends messages' to the public, from which it has been seen to follow that the language has to be tightly monitored to make sure that it sends the 'right' message, or in favoured New Labour parlance is 'on message'. In fact one question that Naughtie asks Prescott is whether on this occasion he abided by Government policy that all ministerial media statements should be 'checked' by the Prime Minister's press office (headed by another formidable spin-doctor, Alistair Campbell). Prescott's rather sour reply was that he had 'talked to people' about what he 'was going to say' - he seems to avoid using the word 'check', which would imply the Deputy Prime Minister (Prescott) being subject to the judgement of an unelected official. </p> <p>Read more about <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/extracts/story/0,6761,142952,00.html\">Language, politics, and government</a><br> Read more about <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/extracts/story/0,6761,142953,00.html\">Blair's rhetorical style</a><br> Read more about <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/extracts/story/0,6761,142955,00.html\">New Labour keywords: renewal, modernisation, and reform</a></p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>What's behind the rise? </strong><br></p> <p>The price of oil has reached $31 (\u00a320) a barrel - a level not seen since the 1990 Gulf war. At the start of last year, oil cost only $10 a barrel, having gone into a nosedive because of the Asian economic crisis in 1997. As Asia slumped into recession, demand for oil fell, driving down prices. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries - the cartel of 11 oil-producing countries - decided last year to cut back production by 4.3m barrels per day (bpd) to boost prices and it has succeeded spectacularly.</p> <p><strong>Haven't we been here before? </strong><br></p> <p>Opec used to be a little-known cartel formed in 1960 with five members - Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. By the end of 1971 six other nations had joined the group - Qatar, Indonesia, Libya, United Arab Emirates, Algeria and Nigeria. The cartel reached public awareness after the 1973 October war, when Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack on Israel. Arab exporters imposed an embargo on western countries supporting Israel. Oil prices quadrupled in the world's first oil crisis. Three other crises followed, however, the first was the most damaging.</p> <p><strong>Does Opec want another crisis? </strong><br></p> <p>No. Recession in the industrialised world is the last thing Opec wants. The cartel decided to curtail production last month in order to push the price up to a \"fair\" price of around $18-$20 a barrel. But it is notoriously hard to control markets and they often overshoot the mark. The US stock market is another example of a dangerously overheated market, according to analysts. In the oil market, prices have exceeded the intended target.</p> <p><strong>So what's being done about these prices? </strong><br></p> <p>The US is leading the effort to persuade Opec to raise production and bring down prices.

      "bodyText": "What's behind the rise? The price of oil has reached $31 (\u00a320) a barrel - a level not seen since the 1990 Gulf war. At the start of last year, oil cost only $10 a barrel, having gone into a nosedive because of the Asian economic crisis in 1997. As Asia slumped into recession, demand for oil fell, driving down prices. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries - the cartel of 11 oil-producing countries - decided last year to cut back production by 4.3m barrels per day (bpd) to boost prices and it has succeeded spectacularly. Haven't we been here before? Opec used to be a little-known cartel formed in 1960 with five members - Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. By the end of 1971 six other nations had joined the group - Qatar, Indonesia, Libya, United Arab Emirates, Algeria and Nigeria. The cartel reached public awareness after the 1973 October war, when Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack on Israel. Arab exporters imposed an embargo on western countries supporting Israel. Oil prices quadrupled in the world's first oil crisis. Three other crises followed, however, the first was the most damaging. Does Opec want another crisis? No. Recession in the industrialised world is the last thing Opec wants. The cartel decided to curtail production last month in order to push the price up to a \"fair\" price of around $18-$20 a barrel. But it is notoriously hard to control markets and they often overshoot the mark. The US stock market is another example of a dangerously overheated market, according to analysts. In the oil market, prices have exceeded the intended target. So what's being done about these prices? The US is leading the effort to persuade Opec to raise production and bring down prices. Energy secretary Bill Richardson has been touring producing countries, cajoling them to open the spigots, and oil ministers have been talking about what to do before a formal Opec meeting on March 27. Opec officials say they expect the meeting to recommend that Opec increase output by 1.2m bpd, with a further rise of 500,000 bpd if prices did not fall sharply. Would this be enough to lower prices? Analysts believe not because it is only a quarter of the 4.3m bpd cut in production from last April. They argue that the price has already factored in an increase of 1.2m bpd. Why is the US leading the effort for lower prices? Because America - Opec's largest customer - is a huge consumer of energy and pressure is building on the White House to do something. Members of Congress have demanded that the Clinton administration cut off aid and arms sales to Opec countries as American citizens start to complain about the high price of petrol and domestic fuel. Even if Opec did respond to US pressure, it may come too late to prevent petrol prices - already at a 10-year peak - from hitting $2 a gallon this summer, when Americans fill up their tanks for the holidays. That would not bode well vice-president Al Gore in the Democratic presidential race for the White House. The US says it may release oil from its emergency reserves to depress prices.

The ruling means that about 2,000 season ticket holders will have to move from their seats to make way for executive boxes.</p> <p>The legal spat began when Newcastle announced plans to knock up a hospitality suite as part of a \u00a345m redevelopment of the ground - which they say will accommodate an extra 15,000 supporters. But, if you ask the Fiver, it's more likely to host 15,000 half-cut and semi-interested businessmen instead. As they weren't allowed to simply chuck a new stand on top of supporters sitting in their seats - although that's an idea - the club informed 2,000 fans they would be shifted to far-flung corners of the stadium with poorer views than the ones they've already got (we're paraphrasing here of course).</p> <p>Not surprisingly, some fans were unhappy with the scheme, and embarked on an ultimately unsuccessful legal battle, which was lost because it was ruled that the small print in the bond contract gave the club carte blanche to move folk about. However, there is some light at the end of the tunnel; the six supporters were given leave to appeal against the ruling on the grounds that the club had misrepresented its original bond offer in 1994.

The cost to General Pinochet, the cost to our relationship with Chile and the cost in financial terms to the taxpayer of this mad escapade must all be laid at the door of the home secretary.\" Lord Tebbit, Conservative peer \"I think there will be a few glasses raised behind closed doors. It's been extremely difficult for everyone but especially disruptive for those with properties closest to the house. It's a most unsuitable place to hold political prisoners. Now life can get back to normal.\" Wentworth residents' association chairman Barry Hughes \"Politics and government intervention has got in the way of justice. This cannot be right. He left the estate by a back route like a criminal. He is going on the grounds of compassion not because he is innocent. We feel let down by Britain and in particular by this Labour government.\" Demonstrator Sylvia Velasquez \"He was obviously nervous and anxious ahead of the decision. He was told in a telephone call very shortly before it was made public. He will have been delighted.\" Patrick Robertson, adviser to General Pinochet \"It's a terrible disappointment for Pinochet's thousands of victims that he will not face trial in Spain. But the very fact that he was arrested, and that his claim of immunity was rejected, has already changed the calculus of dictators around the world. The Pinochet case signified the beginning of the end of their impunity.\" Reed Brody, advocacy director of Human Rights Watch \"I'm not surprised by this decision, which confirms that England is still a safe haven for criminals of all kinds.\" Bernard Bertrossa, the Swiss prosecuting magistrate who applied for Pinochet's extradition. Reported by right-leaning Spanish daily ABC \"The cases being brought in Chile by Judge Guzm\u00e1n and judge Mu\u00f1oz have gone so far now that they should lead to a point at which Gen Pinochet is tried. I can foresee the course of events leading to a trial of Pinochet in Chile. Obviously, these cases will be a helped a great deal by Gen Pinochet being returned to Chile.\" Juan Gabriel Vald\u00e9s, Chilean foreign minister, speaking to centre-left Spanish daily El Pa\u00eds \"I respect Straw's decision. What I don't know is, what does everyone else [the opposition Socialist party - which has criticised the decision] have respect for. [My government] has respected the decision of the Spanish justice system to seek Pinochet's extradition, while the same people [the socialists] criticised it. The government's attitude has been the same right from the start. The rest [the socialist stance] seems to me to be an internal rumpus, which makes me laugh.\" Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar, Spanish prime minister, quoted by Spanish news agency EFE, talking to right of centre radio station COPE \"The idea that many people have outside Chile that Pinochet is in a position to arrive back here, bang his fist on the table and say 'Nobody here is going to court' is madness. \"I would be sorry if Pinochet's arrival upset the handover of power... We can't rule out the possibility that there will be difficult times ahead, but we hope they won't be too difficult. \"The president doesn't exercise justice, but he must ensure that the judiciary is able to do so without conditions or external pressures, or else we would be looking at a castrated democracy... In my country, no-one is above the law, whatever their name. \"The humanitarian appeal, such as it's outlined in the English system, as we've recently seen, does not exist in Chile.\" Chilean president-elect Ricardo Lagos, speaking in Uruguay.

      "body": "<p>Language has always been important in politics and in government (I don't see politics and government as the same thing - I shall draw a distinction between them below). Political differences have always been constituted as differences in language, political struggles have always been partly struggles over the dominant language, and both the theory and practice of political rhetoric go back to ancient times. Language has therefore always been a relevant consideration in political analysis. But language has become significantly more important over the past few decades because of social changes which have transformed politics and government. An important part of these changes is a new relationship between politics, government and mass media - a new synthesis which means that many significant political events are now in fact media events (for instance, a TV interview with the Prime Minister can itself be a major political event). There has been what one might call a 'mediatisation' of politics and government.The particular genius of Peter Mandelson has perhaps been in seeing that these changes may have more radical implications for the nature of politics and government than has so far been realised. Mandelson has not been alone in seeing this: to a degree what he has done is bring to British politics developments which have been going on elsewhere, particularly in the USA. But there is also a process of change which is being referred to in the USA, Britain and internationally as the 'reinvention of government', which entails a greater focusing of language.</p> <p> One consequence of the 'mediatisation' of politics and govern-ment is the transformation of political leaders into media personalities. This probably started in Britain with Harold Macmillan in the 1950s. Tony Blair's immensely successful populist leadership style is comparable in certain respects with Margaret Thatcher's, though very different in other respects. The communicative style of leaders is now recognised as a crucial factor in political success or failure, and Labour is acutely aware of this because their recent history has included failures, notably Michael Foot but also to some extent Neil Kinnock. Communicative style is a matter of language in the broadest sense - certainly verbal language (words), but also all other aspects of the complex bodily performance that constitutes political style (gestures, facial expressions, how people hold them-selves and move, dress and hairstyle, and so forth). A successful leader's communicative style is not simply what makes him or her attractive to voters in a general way, it conveys certain values which can powerfully enhance the political 'message'.</p> <p>New Labour claims to be a 'new politics'. According to Tony Blair, \"ideas need labels if they are to become popular and widely understood. The 'Third Way' is to my mind the best label for the new politics which the progressive centre-left is forging in Britain and beyond\". Notice two things about this: first, the 'Third Way' is being 'forged'; second, 'forging' it is linked to making it 'popular and widely understood'. The 'Third Way' does not come ready-formed, nor is it forged once-and-for-all. On the contrary, New Labour politicians are constantly forming and formulating it, in speeches, newspaper articles, books and pamphlets, official documents, etc. They are constantly working on making coherent connections between the policies and ideas - 'enterprise', 'flexibility', 'welfare-to-work', 'social exclusion/inclusion', 'participation','fairness', and so forth.The 'Third Way' is constantly being talked into being, new language is constantly being found to bring these elements together into a coherent whole. This is a process that cannot be completed \u00be circumstances keep changing, and differences within New Labour are worked through in different formulations, differences of language. And crucially this is going on in public - there is no clear line between finding policies that work and finding policies that win consent. As Franklin puts it, 'New Labour' is perhaps the first government genuinely committed to the view that presentation is part of the process of policy formation'. Analysing the shifting language of the 'Third Way' is an essential part of getting to grips with the 'new politics' of New Labour. </p> <p>At the same time, New Labour is involved in a 'reinvention of government' which in itself entails a greater salience for language. In part, this is a matter of a new form of control from the centre based upon business corporation models, including promotional means for managing consent.This involves 'government by media spin', but also what Blair has referred to as 'experiments in democracy' through for instance 'focus groups' and 'citizens' juries', which allow the Government to develop its policy in a way that incorporates public opinion from the start. But the centralised management of political communication in the New Labour Government seems to be at odds with another aspect of the 'reinvention of government' - the Government's commitment to 'devolving power and making government more open and responsive'. This includes a certain dispersal of government, which is indicated by the concept of 'participation' - a great many task forces, reviews and advisory groups have been set up with memberships that bring together the Government, business, voluntary organisations and other sections of society. Many groups and people who have hitherto not been involved in government are being drawn in, and it is in that sense that government is becoming more dispersed. However, this does not mean that the centre has given up control - it is a dispersal, but not a fragmentation. In so far as 'partnership' becomes a reality rather than just a rhetoric, it entails a new form of control that crucially involves language - shaping the culture, discourse and language of the dispersed agents of government rather than directly controlling what they do. </p> <p>Go back to <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/extracts/story/0,6761,142560,00.html\">New Labour, new language?</a><br> Read more about <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/extracts/story/0,6761,142953,00.html\">Blair's rhetorical style</a><br> Read more about <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/extracts/story/0,6761,142955,00.html\">New Labour keywords: renewal, modernisation, and reform</a> </p> <p>\u00a9 Norman Fairclough, Routledge publishers, 2000</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.routledge.com/routledge/feature/current/newlabou.html\" target=\"_NEW\">Visit Routledge's page on New Labour, New Language?</a></p>",

There were cries of \"shame\" in the Commons as Mr Straw confirmed that Gen Pinochet \"has now left the jurisdiction of the UK\". A Chilean air force jet carrying the 84-year-old took off from RAF Waddington, near Lincoln, at 1.10pm today, after a police escort had rushed the former dictator from Wentworth, Surrey, where he had been under house arrest since October 1998. Mr Straw announced his decision to release Gen Pinochet at 8am this morning in a written parliamentary answer. \"I have today decided that I will not order the extradition of senator Pinochet to Spain,\" Mr Straw said. The home secretary told the Commons this afternoon that he was \"satisfied the conclusion of the medical report was correct\", which had led to his January decision that he was \"minded\" to release Gen Pinochet. A trial \"however desirable was simply no longer possible\", he said. But he said the lasting legacy to the 17 months of wrangling over the Pinochet case was \"the principle that those who commit human rights abuses in one country cannot assume that they are safe elsewhere\". The House of Lords judgment which denied Gen Pinochet blanket immunity was \"a landmark judgment in human rights law, whose impact has been felt far beyond our shores\", Mr Straw said. \"It will be a permanent legacy of the Pinochet case.\" He explained that Britain's extradition obligations had given him a \"quasi-judicial role\" in the case, making the decisions to allow the extradition to proceed, before revoking it on health grounds \"mine and mine alone, and not those of Her Majesty's government\". In the wake of this \"unprecedented case\", the extradition act of 1989 needed to be reviewed, the home secretary said, confirming that he would publish consultation papers on \"streamlining\" the extradition process. After renewed appeals from Belgium and Amnesty International against Mr Straw's January decision, the home secretary revealed that the medical report which found Gen Pinochet unfit to stand trial had been reconsidered by the government's chief medical officer Liam Donaldson, who confirmed its \"quality and thoroughness\". Ann Widdecombe, the shadow home secretary, responded to Mr Straw's statement by calling his decision \"a satisfactory outcome, but of a deeply unsatisfactory case\". Ms Widdecombe asked for an estimate of the \"full costs\" of the case.

The 16-month legal battle over the 84-year-old general's fate ended he departed aboard a Chilean air force plane.</p> <p>\"The senator has now left the jurisdiction of this country,\" Mr Straw told the House of Commons amid scattered cheers from some MPs. \"All the decisions which I have taken have been mine alone.\"</p> <p>Gen Pinochet's plane took off for Chile in torrential rain just minutes after his motorcade arrived at Waddington air force base near Lincoln.</p> <p>In a written parliamentary answer released just after 8am, Mr Straw unveiled his long-awaited decision, declaring: \"I have today decided that I will not order the extradition of senator Pinochet to Spain.\"</p> <p>Gen Pinochet's departure brings to a close the extraordinary diplomatic, political and legal saga prompted by his arrest in London sixteen-and-a-half months ago.</p> <p>The crown prosecution service (CPS) confirmed that Gen Pinochet could not be prosecuted in the UK. In a statement, the CPS said it had advised the Metropolitan police that \"there is no realistic prospect in this jurisdiction of convicting senator Pinochet of any criminal offence\". The statement said that the solicitor general, Ross Cranston QC, had been consulted and agreed with these conclusions.</p> <p>Even after Mr Straw's ruling, Gen Pinochet's release could still have been blocked, temporarily at least, if interested parties had mounted a last-ditch challenge by seeking a high court injunction to prevent him leaving the country, pending a judicial review of the decision. That did not happen.</p> <p>Earlier this morning, as Gen Pinochet's convoy left the house in Wentworth, Surrey, where he has been under house arrest, his adviser Patrick Robertson said: \"He was obviously nervous and anxious ahead of the decision. He was told in a telephone call very shortly before it was made public. He will have been delighted.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Chile's former dictator Augusto Pinochet left Britain today after home secretary Jack Straw ruled that he should not be extradited to Spain to face trial for torture allegations. The 16-month legal battle over the 84-year-old general's fate ended he departed aboard a Chilean air force plane. \"The senator has now left the jurisdiction of this country,\" Mr Straw told the House of Commons amid scattered cheers from some MPs. \"All the decisions which I have taken have been mine alone.\" Gen Pinochet's plane took off for Chile in torrential rain just minutes after his motorcade arrived at Waddington air force base near Lincoln. In a written parliamentary answer released just after 8am, Mr Straw unveiled his long-awaited decision, declaring: \"I have today decided that I will not order the extradition of senator Pinochet to Spain.\" Gen Pinochet's departure brings to a close the extraordinary diplomatic, political and legal saga prompted by his arrest in London sixteen-and-a-half months ago. The crown prosecution service (CPS) confirmed that Gen Pinochet could not be prosecuted in the UK. In a statement, the CPS said it had advised the Metropolitan police that \"there is no realistic prospect in this jurisdiction of convicting senator Pinochet of any criminal offence\". The statement said that the solicitor general, Ross Cranston QC, had been consulted and agreed with these conclusions. Even after Mr Straw's ruling, Gen Pinochet's release could still have been blocked, temporarily at least, if interested parties had mounted a last-ditch challenge by seeking a high court injunction to prevent him leaving the country, pending a judicial review of the decision. That did not happen. Earlier this morning, as Gen Pinochet's convoy left the house in Wentworth, Surrey, where he has been under house arrest, his adviser Patrick Robertson said: \"He was obviously nervous and anxious ahead of the decision. He was told in a telephone call very shortly before it was made public. He will have been delighted.\"",

      "body": "<p>The transformation of the auction market from crusty old seller of antiques to cutting-edge 21st industry offers a potent examples of how fast an e-commerce revolution can take hold. </p> <p>Last year, new kid on the block, <a href=\"http://www.ebay.com\" target=\"_new\">eBay</a> bought San Francisco 's Butterfield &amp; Butterfield for $260m. eBay had been trading for less than five years; Butterfield &amp; Butterfield had been trading for 135. </p> <p>In November, online bookseller, <a href=\"http://sothebys.amazon.com\" target=\"_new\">Amazon</a>, bought $45.4m worth of Sothebys equity. But even though the gold dust has yet to settle in the auction houses - expect a further round of acquisitions and launches in the coming months - another online storm is already brewing, this time in the art market. </p> <p>In the US, a number of online art galleries have already been shifting some very valuable works of art. One anonymous buyer on <a href=\"http://www.Artnet.com\" target=\"_new\">Artnet.com</a> bought Lucio Fontana's 1959 Concetto Spaziale, Attese, for a cool $168,000 last year, while paintings on Ewolf.com have sold for similar amounts. </p> <p>Late last year saw the launch of <a href=\"http://www.Eyestorm.com\" target=\"_new\">Eyestorm.com</a>, a UK-based company that hopes to revolutionise the global art market by opening up its dealings to a wider public. Eyestorm sees itself as being able to create a \"parallel market\", by bringing works of art to a new audience. It sells a mixture of unique items - such as Warhol Polaroids and photocollages by David Hockney - and limited edition prints by the likes of Andy Goldsworth and Damien Hirst. </p> <p>\"Our task is to make art more accessible,\" says Eyestorm's chief executive Don Atkinson. \"And we are doing that by showing the work to a world wide audience as opposed to a very limited audience that exists in the gallery system.\" </p> <p>To do this, Eyestorm required a budget said to be about $5m. It raised the money through venture capitalists eVenture and Arts Alliance. After some pretty heavy market research, the company thinks it has spotted a gap in the market and is convinced that its investment will lead to a lucrative slice of the e-conomy. </p> <p>\"Another way in which we are making art more accessible is in our price strategy,\" says Atkinson. \"What we have done is manage to persuade artists to run limited edition prints, usually one to 500, and for them to agree a reduced price point - one that averages between $400 and $500.\" </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.londonart.co.uk\">Londonart</a>, a small independent company, has been selling art exclusively online since 1997. With approximately one tenth of Eyestorm's budget the site initially struggled to make any impact on the London market. But the last six months have seen sales rise by 50% per month, and it might even turn a small profit by the end of the year. </p> <p>Paul Wynter, managing director of Londonart, says an online art market is emerging because, \"gallery spaces are very difficult for some people who feel they are likely to be given the cold shoulder. The internet presents no barrier to anyone entering, viewing or buying art. I think that is fantastic.\" </p> <p>Both Eyestorm and Londonart see the key to their success in providing editorial content to accompany their wares. This makes both sites attractive, not just to prospective buyers, but to art lovers as a whole. Londonart carries an online magazine and extensive arts listings. Eyestorm has embraced the interactive aspects on the internet and provided some impressive multi-media \"documentaries ' to accompany the artists it represents. It also offers the chance to curate your own online gallery, and if desktop pictures are your thing, you could do worse than look here. </p> <p>Atkinson says: \"We make our artists' work more approachable by expanding understanding about the work itself. We do this by emphasising editorial on our website, because we think that people need to read about the artists and to understand the period when the piece was made.\" Unlike many e-commerce sites, both Eyestorm and Londonart employ full-time editors and have a brigade of notable critics to back them up. </p> <p>But what is to stop artists simply selling their work from their own website? Says Atkinson: \"When an artist comes to us, they get to concentrate on their work. We give them access to new technology, our considerable marketing clout and our distribution channel.\" </p> <p>Wynter adds that new customers will generate new market forces. This, he says, is forcing existing galleries to wake up. \"I think most most galleries are already in the stages of building a website or are certainly planning to do so. But I think the key point is that if you are a gallery or an artist, it is going to prove very difficult to be found - even if you are relatively well known. </p> <p>\"I think selling art online will really come down to specialist players who have the expertise to build content and place useful information alongside the art that is on sale.\" </p> <p>Also joining the fray next month will be San Francisco-based <a href=\"http://www.iTheo.com\">www.iTheo.com</a> , which claims to provide a site where artists can promote, market and sell their own work to \"a world of new collectors, without the barriers of gallery walls\". </p> <p>The site is offering $12,000 in cash grants, which along with the commissioning powers of sites like Eyestorm and Londonart, should prove to artists that the web may be the ideal place to sell their work in the 21st century. </p> <p>It is still early days, and the art market is notoriously secretive and slow-moving, so don't expect a raft of stock market flotations just yet. But the appetite for buying fine art, antiques and collectables continues to grow. Although no specific figures exist on art sales online, Forrester Research predicts that online auction sales will reach $19bn per year by 2003. </p> <p>A couple of years ago, who would imagined that the time-honoured auction houses were about to come under the hammer to a set of internet upstarts? A couple of years from now, it may well be the galleries who are forced to transform themselves into an industry of the future.</p>",

After some pretty heavy market research, the company thinks it has spotted a gap in the market and is convinced that its investment will lead to a lucrative slice of the e-conomy. \"Another way in which we are making art more accessible is in our price strategy,\" says Atkinson. \"What we have done is manage to persuade artists to run limited edition prints, usually one to 500, and for them to agree a reduced price point - one that averages between $400 and $500.\" Londonart, a small independent company, has been selling art exclusively online since 1997. With approximately one tenth of Eyestorm's budget the site initially struggled to make any impact on the London market. But the last six months have seen sales rise by 50% per month, and it might even turn a small profit by the end of the year. Paul Wynter, managing director of Londonart, says an online art market is emerging because, \"gallery spaces are very difficult for some people who feel they are likely to be given the cold shoulder. The internet presents no barrier to anyone entering, viewing or buying art. I think that is fantastic.\" Both Eyestorm and Londonart see the key to their success in providing editorial content to accompany their wares. This makes both sites attractive, not just to prospective buyers, but to art lovers as a whole. Londonart carries an online magazine and extensive arts listings. Eyestorm has embraced the interactive aspects on the internet and provided some impressive multi-media \"documentaries ' to accompany the artists it represents. It also offers the chance to curate your own online gallery, and if desktop pictures are your thing, you could do worse than look here. Atkinson says: \"We make our artists' work more approachable by expanding understanding about the work itself. We do this by emphasising editorial on our website, because we think that people need to read about the artists and to understand the period when the piece was made.\" Unlike many e-commerce sites, both Eyestorm and Londonart employ full-time editors and have a brigade of notable critics to back them up. But what is to stop artists simply selling their work from their own website? Says Atkinson: \"When an artist comes to us, they get to concentrate on their work. We give them access to new technology, our considerable marketing clout and our distribution channel.\" Wynter adds that new customers will generate new market forces. This, he says, is forcing existing galleries to wake up. \"I think most most galleries are already in the stages of building a website or are certainly planning to do so. But I think the key point is that if you are a gallery or an artist, it is going to prove very difficult to be found - even if you are relatively well known. \"I think selling art online will really come down to specialist players who have the expertise to build content and place useful information alongside the art that is on sale.\" Also joining the fray next month will be San Francisco-based www.iTheo.com , which claims to provide a site where artists can promote, market and sell their own work to \"a world of new collectors, without the barriers of gallery walls\". The site is offering $12,000 in cash grants, which along with the commissioning powers of sites like Eyestorm and Londonart, should prove to artists that the web may be the ideal place to sell their work in the 21st century. It is still early days, and the art market is notoriously secretive and slow-moving, so don't expect a raft of stock market flotations just yet. But the appetite for buying fine art, antiques and collectables continues to grow. Although no specific figures exist on art sales online, Forrester Research predicts that online auction sales will reach $19bn per year by 2003. A couple of years ago, who would imagined that the time-honoured auction houses were about to come under the hammer to a set of internet upstarts? A couple of years from now, it may well be the galleries who are forced to transform themselves into an industry of the future.",

This year's is her 12th nomination - a disappointing haul as Ms Carroll suggests, which only manages to tie her for the all-time record with Katharine Hepburn. \u0095 In a Sunday newspaper, shocking claims are made against Michael Winner who - according to a former producer of the show - is blacklisted from appearing on This Is Your Life because not enough people are willing to go on and say nice things about him. Michael is amused at the slur. \"It's quite funny, but they've been on to us about five times over the years,\" he says, adding that he has refused to ask his famous friends to appear (\"Charles Bronson, Burt Lancaster, Sophia Loren, Faye Dunaway . . .\") as the show demands. He was first approached in the 60s, he insists, but one barrier was fear of his litigious mother appearing in a wheelchair to serve him a writ on air. A lovely family.",

In another \"basic injustice\" condemned by Sir Geoffrey, they can continue practising as locums or privately while information about their past performance never comes to light. </p> <p>Both issues were highlighted by the health ombudsman, Michael Buckley, in his 1998-99 annual report. Yesterday he threw his full backing behind the bill. </p> <p>The proposed legislation, drafted by the Consumers' Association, would allow patients to continue to seek redress for grievances, even if their GP retired. </p> <p>Sir Geoffrey said yesterday: \"There have been a significant number of cases of patients left unable to obtain justice. This is an obvious loophole which needs blocking.\" </p> <p>David Hinchliffe, Labour chairman of the Commons health committee and a sponsor of the bill, said: \"There is a clear anomaly in the current arrangements which must be resolved.\" </p> <p>The Consumers' Association is backing reform as part of a wider campaign to tackle \"serious shortcomings\" in complaints systems for patients. </p> <p>Emma Harrison, its public affairs officer, said: \"If GPs have got something to hide, there is even more reason for the public to know. Consumers want fair treatment.\" </p> <p>The association has been a leading critic of the NHS complaints process, the GMC's discliplinary system and the complaints procedure for private health patients. </p> <p>It wants the remit of the ombudsman's office extended to cover private health care, and the creation of a \"one stop\" public sector ombudsman's scheme covering health, housing and social services.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A legal loophole, allowing general practitioners facing complaints from patients to avoid investigation by retiring, is to be closed under new legislation. A bill to be presented in parliament tomorrow will give the health service ombudsman new powers to pursue GPs, dentists, pharmacists and opticians, even if they stop practising in the national health service. The measure is being put forward as a private member's bill by the Conservative MP for Wealden, Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith, but has government and cross-party support. Ministers may decide to wrap it into wider legislation tightening checks on GPs, which is being introduced in the wake of the Shipman mass murder case. The health secretary, Alan Milburn, is examining ways to increase the accountability and effectiveness of the General Medical Council, which has come under renewed fire since the Hyde GP was convicted of killing 15 elderly patients last month. The home office is already reviewing a similar loophole allowing senior police officers to dodge investigation through retirement, following recommendations from the Stephen Lawrence inquiry. At present, GPs and other health professionals cannot be touched by health service watchdogs once they \"officially retire\", even if they do so while an investigation is under way. In another \"basic injustice\" condemned by Sir Geoffrey, they can continue practising as locums or privately while information about their past performance never comes to light. Both issues were highlighted by the health ombudsman, Michael Buckley, in his 1998-99 annual report. Yesterday he threw his full backing behind the bill. The proposed legislation, drafted by the Consumers' Association, would allow patients to continue to seek redress for grievances, even if their GP retired. Sir Geoffrey said yesterday: \"There have been a significant number of cases of patients left unable to obtain justice. This is an obvious loophole which needs blocking.\" David Hinchliffe, Labour chairman of the Commons health committee and a sponsor of the bill, said: \"There is a clear anomaly in the current arrangements which must be resolved.\" The Consumers' Association is backing reform as part of a wider campaign to tackle \"serious shortcomings\" in complaints systems for patients. Emma Harrison, its public affairs officer, said: \"If GPs have got something to hide, there is even more reason for the public to know. Consumers want fair treatment.\" The association has been a leading critic of the NHS complaints process, the GMC's discliplinary system and the complaints procedure for private health patients. It wants the remit of the ombudsman's office extended to cover private health care, and the creation of a \"one stop\" public sector ombudsman's scheme covering health, housing and social services.",

Even so, while acknowledging the legitimacy of public concerns about the environment and food safety, his article on Sunday avoided the real issue: the corporate capture of the food chain. </p> <p> Mr Blair's backing for the biotech companies has, as he now appears to have recognised, done him untold harm. It has taught businesses that he's a dupe who will sing to their tune, however off-key it may be. It has encouraged voters to explore the other insalubrious liaisons in which he has become entangled. His conversion to neutrality, even in the narrowest political terms, is long overdue. But it will take a lot more than an article in a Sunday newspaper to make it look convincing. </p> <p>To recover his credibility, he must snatch government policy out of the hands of the biotech business. This means relieving Lord Sainsbury, whose crashing conflicts of interest remain a major political embarrassment, of his duties as science minister. He must sack Professor Ray Baker, the head of the government's biotechnology research council. Professor Baker has used his post as a platform for misleading public statements in support of GM, while his council gags researchers who wish to speak out against the technology. </p> <p>Meetings of the biotech advisory committees must all be made public, and their members prevented from voting on decisions in which they have a commercial interest. The flow of research funds should be reversed. Last year the government spent \u00a352m on developing GM crops, for which demand in Britain is approximately zero, and \u00a31.7m on research into organic farming, for which demand outstrips domestic supply by 200%. The Foresight committees, which help guide the allocation of government science funds, but are dominated by business people, must be dismantled. </p> <p>If field trials are to continue (and it's not easy to see the point of spending taxpayers' money to discover whether plants engineered to destroy wildlife are bad for the environment), they must be isolated from other crops and redesigned.

When Margaret Thatcher sent him to health, the health establishment found itself, to its horror, in the clutches of a man who was palpably overweight and hugely fond of a large cigar. Now he not only smokes them, he markets them too, as deputy chairman of BAT. In which capacity he was invited a fortnight ago before the health select committee of the Commons to reply to allegations raised in this newspaper that the company had been knowingly involved in the smuggling of cigarettes around the world.

But in this case, it seemed rather odd, since a few days before he had written a piece in the Guardian defending BAT against these same allegations. Even more curiously, that piece had contained what looked like a candid admission that BAT had done what he said that it hadn't. But when this was put to him, he got quite cross, said it was not an admission, and complained of selective quotation.</p> <p>What did for the Clarke-Redwood ticket in 1997, apart from its ludicrous line-up, was the intervention of Margaret Thatcher: no fan of Clarke - as he, to his credit, has never pretended that he was a fan of hers.

I am disappointed to see the fight against racism being hijacked by humourless political wannabes. Mark Morley London The real question is how such glib racist assumptions are allowed to continuously circulate in the British media. Kennedy's remarks are part of the general mass of \"inferential racism\", particularly when it comes to discussing black people and their bodies (eg in sport and entertainment). \"Black success\" is all too often attributed to \"black genes\". Why do we never hear debates about Scandinavians being so naturally adept at the forehand smash in tennis? Dr Sarita Malik Isleworth, Middlesex saritamalik@hotmail.com",

The result is today's wrangling and unworkable coalition, mingling unrepentant Thatcherites with realists who accept that the show is over. Sir Edward was right to say as he celebrated his anniversary that the Tories cannot win next time unless they woo back the middle ground voters they now seem to spurn. Right, but irrelevant.

Yet compared with skipper Hague's floundering vessel, Ted Heath's Tory party was a successful ship. And, no doubt to his satisfaction, the origins of the party's present unseaworthy state are traceable to the successor he resents and mistrusts. The feuding which wracks it is not just about Europe; it is also about the Thatcherite legacy and the imputed treason of those who seek to erase it. The result is today's wrangling and unworkable coalition, mingling unrepentant Thatcherites with realists who accept that the show is over. Sir Edward was right to say as he celebrated his anniversary that the Tories cannot win next time unless they woo back the middle ground voters they now seem to spurn. Right, but irrelevant. For how can they woo such people back without forfeiting the support of that core of the party which still seems to believe that Margaret - like King Arthur or Charlemagne - will one day awake from her sleep and bring the glory days back again?",

      "body": "<p>The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, yesterday saw his hands potentially bound in future peace negotiations with Syria, and in managing his own coalition, after he lost a crucial vote in parliament.</p> <p>In a vote of 60 to 53, with one abstention, the Knesset gave preliminary approval to a private member's bill from the opposition Likud party which would make it far more difficult for Mr Barak to win his promised referendum on a future peace deal with Syria.</p> <p>The bill would require Mr Barak to win the support of more than 50% of Israeli voters, including the 10% who live outside the country, rather than a simple majority of those who cast their votes in a referendum on Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Golan heights.</p> <p>Although the measure must undergo three more readings to become law, and could disappear into committee for a further six months, it is a humbling moment for Mr Barak. The defection of his coalition's rightwing religious partners, who voted with the Likud during this the government's first serious crisis, also raises questions about the viability of the coalition.</p> <p>The repercussions from yesterday's vote may spread outside the country, deepening the concerns of the Syrian president, Hafez al-Assad, that Mr Barak may not be capable of marshalling enough support to make peace.</p> <p>Syrian doubts about Israel's desire for peace rose sharply last week after Israel's foreign minister, David Levy, vowed to retaliate \"blood for blood, soul for soul, child for child\" against Hizbullah for firing across the border from Lebanon.</p> <p>However, Mr Barak said he would bounce back from the vote, and that his coalition was as stable as ever.</p> <p>\"I don't take what happened in the Knesset lightly, but neither should too much be read into it; 1.8m Israeli citizens have charged me with a mission, and no parliamentary ploy can prevent the majority of the nation from expressing its opinion and determining what will happen,\" he told Israel Radio.</p> <p>\"Any agreement [with Syria], if reached, will be brought up for referendum in such a way as to ensure that the majority of those who participate in the referendum will determine the future of the state,\" he said.</p> <p>Other members of his government denounced the measure as racist for seeking to undercut the influence of Palestinian voters on Israel's electoral list. They are widely presumed to vote for an exchange of territory for peace and to have propelled Mr Barak to victory in last May's elections.</p> <p>\"It's a mark of Cain on a democratic society and it is a harsh signal to President Assad,\" said the MP Ahmad Tibi.</p> <p>There is also belief that the bill represents a serious blow to Mr Barak's prestige and will significantly reduce his room to manoeuvre if or when negotiations with Syria - suspended in January - resume. The urgency of reaching an agreement was further underscored yesterday when a bomb planted by Hizbullah in Lebanon killed five pro-Israeli militia men and a Lebanese civilian.</p> <p>Although the immediate topic of yesterday's stormy debate was a peace deal with Syria, the causes of Mr Barak's defeat lie within Israel, in the clashes between the dovish members of his coalition and the religious right.</p> <p>Yesterday's defections represented a show of anger from religious parties, which have been blocked from gaining further influence over religious schooling and have had several clashes with the secular education minister.</p> <p>Some commentators said the defeat exposed Mr Barak's relative political inexperience in putting together so disparate a coalition. They feel the vote could destabilise his government, which would set back both the Syrian and Palestinian peace processes.</p> <p>\"Barak actually formed a very awkward kind of coalition. He could have formed a narrow coalition [and] promoted all kinds of policy directions far more easily,\" said Abraham Diskin, a political scientist at Jerusalem's Hebrew university.</p> <p>\"Now the time has come when you cannot hide any kind of disagreement within the coalition under the carpet.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, yesterday saw his hands potentially bound in future peace negotiations with Syria, and in managing his own coalition, after he lost a crucial vote in parliament. In a vote of 60 to 53, with one abstention, the Knesset gave preliminary approval to a private member's bill from the opposition Likud party which would make it far more difficult for Mr Barak to win his promised referendum on a future peace deal with Syria. The bill would require Mr Barak to win the support of more than 50% of Israeli voters, including the 10% who live outside the country, rather than a simple majority of those who cast their votes in a referendum on Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Golan heights. Although the measure must undergo three more readings to become law, and could disappear into committee for a further six months, it is a humbling moment for Mr Barak. The defection of his coalition's rightwing religious partners, who voted with the Likud during this the government's first serious crisis, also raises questions about the viability of the coalition. The repercussions from yesterday's vote may spread outside the country, deepening the concerns of the Syrian president, Hafez al-Assad, that Mr Barak may not be capable of marshalling enough support to make peace. Syrian doubts about Israel's desire for peace rose sharply last week after Israel's foreign minister, David Levy, vowed to retaliate \"blood for blood, soul for soul, child for child\" against Hizbullah for firing across the border from Lebanon. However, Mr Barak said he would bounce back from the vote, and that his coalition was as stable as ever. \"I don't take what happened in the Knesset lightly, but neither should too much be read into it; 1.8m Israeli citizens have charged me with a mission, and no parliamentary ploy can prevent the majority of the nation from expressing its opinion and determining what will happen,\" he told Israel Radio. \"Any agreement [with Syria], if reached, will be brought up for referendum in such a way as to ensure that the majority of those who participate in the referendum will determine the future of the state,\" he said. Other members of his government denounced the measure as racist for seeking to undercut the influence of Palestinian voters on Israel's electoral list. They are widely presumed to vote for an exchange of territory for peace and to have propelled Mr Barak to victory in last May's elections. \"It's a mark of Cain on a democratic society and it is a harsh signal to President Assad,\" said the MP Ahmad Tibi. There is also belief that the bill represents a serious blow to Mr Barak's prestige and will significantly reduce his room to manoeuvre if or when negotiations with Syria - suspended in January - resume. The urgency of reaching an agreement was further underscored yesterday when a bomb planted by Hizbullah in Lebanon killed five pro-Israeli militia men and a Lebanese civilian. Although the immediate topic of yesterday's stormy debate was a peace deal with Syria, the causes of Mr Barak's defeat lie within Israel, in the clashes between the dovish members of his coalition and the religious right. Yesterday's defections represented a show of anger from religious parties, which have been blocked from gaining further influence over religious schooling and have had several clashes with the secular education minister. Some commentators said the defeat exposed Mr Barak's relative political inexperience in putting together so disparate a coalition. They feel the vote could destabilise his government, which would set back both the Syrian and Palestinian peace processes. \"Barak actually formed a very awkward kind of coalition. He could have formed a narrow coalition [and] promoted all kinds of policy directions far more easily,\" said Abraham Diskin, a political scientist at Jerusalem's Hebrew university. \"Now the time has come when you cannot hide any kind of disagreement within the coalition under the carpet.\"",

The Labour MP George Galloway, one of the most outspoken critics of the sanctions, and Mr Nichol will be the first off the plane when it lands in Baghdad. [Ewen MacAskill] Gene hope for victims of haemophilia American scientists claim today to have successfully delivered gene therapy to people with the inherited bleeding disorder haemophilia. Haemophilia B affects one male in 30,000 worldwide, and severe cases usually need frequent treatment with a clotting factor to protect their joints and prevent internal bleeding that can lead to death. The scientists report in the magazine Nature Genetics that they altered a human adenovirus to carry the genetic instructions to make a blood-clotting protein, factor IX, and injected three adult sufferers. After 100 days, two required significantly less of the infused clotting factor to keep their disease at bay, none showed any adverse effects, and all three showed evidence the gene had transferred to the patient's muscle cells. \"This exciting new treatment offers the possibility of converting severe haemophilia B to a milder form through a relatively non-invasive procedure,\" said Katharine High, of the children's hospital of Philadelphia, who led the study. Gene therapy has been proposed as the ideal treatment for up to 4,000 diseases based on single gene defects. Attempts to treat inherited disorders began 10 years ago, but were disappointing and caused alarm in the US at the deaths in such experiments. \"We are at the beginning,\" said Dr High, \"but our results strengthen the possibility that gene therapy may help patients with other diseases.\" [Tim Radford] Woman sues over drill in foot A grandmother is suing a London hospital after discovering part of a drill in her foot. Greta Buckle was checking her x-rays after doctors at the Central Middlesex hospital had operated on osteoarthritis in her foot and discovered that part of their drilling equipment had been left in a toe bone. Mrs Buckle, 48, of Harlesden, north London, took the x-ray back to her consultant. The centimetre-long section of drill, used in an operation to fuse bones affected by osteoarthritis, is thought to have snapped off and been left in the bone. Mrs Buckle said she had suffered pain and swelling which had forced her to leave her job as a care assistant and wrecked her social life. A spokesman for the Central Middlesex said: \"Drills are very brittle and these things do happen from time to time, but as soon as this was discovered we took the appropriate action and referred the patient to a specialist.\" Mrs Buckle's lawyer, Kurit Kshual, said: \"Our client deserves compensation for what is clearly a case of medical negligence.\" [Martin Wainwright]",

      "bodyText": "One in three jobless people claims to suffer from a longstanding illness that limits his or her activities, a survey reveals today, casting doubt on ministers' confidence of making further big cuts in unemployment. The number rises to more than half the unemployed aged over 45, complicating the equation of job vacancies and numbers of jobless drawn this week by Gordon Brown, the chancellor. The latest government general household survey also shows that workless households are significantly less likely than others to have items like home computers, CD players, microwave ovens and dishwashers. However, between 1996 and 1998 the proportion of households with satellite or cable television increased from 18% to 29%, with the numbers owning home computers rising from 27% to 34%. Some of the largest differences in access to consumer goods are in respect of four items identified by the survey as \"luxuries\": CD players (63% of workless households compared with 86% of working ones), microwave ovens (71% against 86%), tumble dryers (44% against 61%) and dishwashers (12% against 31%). The researchers for the study conceded that some of these disparities could be accounted for by class differences between the employed and unemployed, but said a clear contrast remained even when this was factored in. The survey also shows that while smoking declined greatly in the 1970s and 1980s, it levelled out over the last decade, with 28% of men and 26% of women still smoking. One in four families is now headed by a single parent, an increase of 17% from the 1971 figure of 8%. Headline findings of the survey were published by the office for national statistics last December. But the full results include an analysis of more than 1,200 \"workless\" households, defined as those containing at least one person of working age but having nobody in a paid job or self-employment. Overall, 19% of households were classed as workless and six in 10 of these contained only one adult, although they included markedly more children - 32% of all household members, as against 25% of all members of working households. Compared with working households, more than three times as many women and four times as many men in workless households described their health as \"not good\". In workless households 34% of men and 30% of women said they had a limiting longstanding illness. Among working households, the equivalent proportions were just 12% and 13% respectively.

If it could squirrel General Augusto Pinochet into Chile in the dead of night at some airbase far from Santiago and far from public view, it would. The socialist government has opted for a compromise, flying him into Santiago, but with no bands, guard of honour, bunting or flags. It will not be hailing this as a triumphant diplomatic victory or the return of a hero. Gen Pinochet will arrive back to a country divided about his record, and which on the whole wants to see the issue buried as quickly as possible. One of his supporters in Britain disclosed yesterday that even the military wanted to keep it quiet. The Chilean ambassador to Britain, Pablo Cabrera, conceded last night it could not prevent some pro-Pinochet campaigners turning out for a spot of emotional flag-waving but it would not be government backed. \"The goverment is not planning anything else.

That is why we are issuing this health warning after studying the evidence over the last two weeks.\"</p> <p>Sales of St John's wort, available without a prescription, have increased dramatically in recent years to the point where the market is now worth $6bn (about \u00a33.75bn) in Europe alone. An estimated 2m people have tried the remedy in Britain to treat mild to moderate depression. US sales are growing by 2,000% a year.</p> <p>Prof Breckenridge said new evidence, including studies published in international medical journals, show that St John's wort may stop some medicines working effectively. \"We are advising anyone who is taking a prescribed medicine to seek the advice of their doctor or pharmacist before taking St John's wort.\"</p> <p>The medicines control agency said it was holding discussions with herbal practitioner organisations and trade associations on the information that should be made available with unlicensed herbal remedies containing St John's wort.</p> <p>The deputy chief medical officer, Pat Troop, said: \"St John's wort when taken alone, and with many drugs, causes no harm.

      "bodyText": "The government yesterday issued an urgent health warning over the popular herbal remedy for mild depression, St John's wort, amid fears it can stop certain prescription drugs from working. Women taking the contraceptive pill, HIV patients taking drugs to suppress the virus, epilepsy and asthma sufferers, and people prescribed certain heart drugs could all be affected by the remedy, the medicines control agency said. Alisdair Breckenridge, chairman of the committee on safety of medicines, said: \"The consequences may be serious for some patients. That is why we are issuing this health warning after studying the evidence over the last two weeks.\" Sales of St John's wort, available without a prescription, have increased dramatically in recent years to the point where the market is now worth $6bn (about \u00a33.75bn) in Europe alone. An estimated 2m people have tried the remedy in Britain to treat mild to moderate depression. US sales are growing by 2,000% a year. Prof Breckenridge said new evidence, including studies published in international medical journals, show that St John's wort may stop some medicines working effectively. \"We are advising anyone who is taking a prescribed medicine to seek the advice of their doctor or pharmacist before taking St John's wort.\" The medicines control agency said it was holding discussions with herbal practitioner organisations and trade associations on the information that should be made available with unlicensed herbal remedies containing St John's wort. The deputy chief medical officer, Pat Troop, said: \"St John's wort when taken alone, and with many drugs, causes no harm. When taken with the drugs listed today, there are health concerns. This is why we are taking this balanced approach between public safety and consumer choice.\" Michael McIntyre, chairman of the European herbal practitioners association, said: \"Herbal practitioners are aware that herbal medicines need to be prescribed and taken with care.\" \"Just because something is 'natural' does not mean that it is 100% safe... but people who are not on other medicines can take St John's wort safely.\" St John's wort is a yellow hedgerow plant (Hypercium perforatum) known as \"nature's Prozac\". According to legend it was discovered by St John the Baptist, and the dried flowers of the plant have been used to treat depression since the Middle Ages. Recent studies have shown that it can affect drug metabolism, speeding up the rate at which other medicines are broken down in the liver and reducing their effectiveness. This can mean that patients are prescribed higher doses of the drug to begin with, and if they stop taking St John's wort levels of the medicine in their blood may be too high. It can also add to the effect that some drugs (for instance, prescribed anti-depressants) can have on the brain, triggering adverse reactions. Herbal remedies do not need to be licensed, and as such cannot make any claims to be clinically effective, but manufacturers and herbal practitioners say this also stops them from printing adequate advice about products. The government is holding talks with manufacturers to look at changing labels to warn people of the risks.",

      "bodyText": "The former dictator of Chile, Augusto Pinochet, is widely expected to begin his return journey home today when Jack Straw makes his announcement on whether or not to halt extradition proceedings against him at 8 o' clock this morning. The home secretary is almost certain to uphold his decision, taken in early January, that he was \"minded\" to release the general on the strength of a medical report which found the 84-year-old had suffered extensive brain damage as a result of a series of strokes. Barring any last minute legal challenges, Pinochet is likely to be freed from his 16 months of house arrest today to board a Chilean air force jet that has been waiting at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire for the 15-hour flight to Chile. In a written parliamentary reply yesterday afternoon Mr Straw said he would give full reasons for his decision when he makes his announcement. The home secretary has spent the last week studying representations on the medical report made by the four countries seeking to extradite the general. Spain, Belgium, Switzerland and France all challenged Mr Straw's assessment that Pinochet was unfit to stand trial in their submissions to the home office, calling for the general to undergo further medical tests. Despite the early morning timing of the announcement there is nothing to stop any of the states involved from seeking an immediate injunction of the home secretary's decision at the high court. Last night none of the four countries involved appeared to be preparing a legal challenge to Mr Straw. Even if a last-minute appeal was launched, it would be unlikely to succeed as the home secretary's discretion in extradition matters is so wide-ranging. The Belgian authorities, who have led recent attempts to keep the former dictator in Britain by forcing Mr Straw to release Pinochet's confidential medical report, hinted they might hold back from challenging the home secretary's decision. A spokesman for the Belgian foreign ministry said they would wait for the home secretary's announcement before deciding on a course of action. \"We are aware that of course we could appeal. But we consider that the margin for action is very narrow. We are also aware that Pinochet can refuse to sustain another medical examination.\" A spokesman for the Swiss authorities, who despite having a warrant out for Pinochet's arrest have so far played no part in any of the legal proceedings, stressed they would also wait for Mr Straw's decision before deciding whether to take any action. Baltasar Garzon, the investigating Spanish magistrate who has been the driving force behind international attempts to bring Pinochet to justice, is unlikely to be able to appeal against Mr Straw's decision even if he wanted to. It was an arrest warrant from Judge Garzon that led to Pinochet's arrest while the general was recovering from back surgery in a London hospital in October 1998. The Spanish government, which has never been comfortable with the prospect of the former dictator arriving in Madrid to stand trial, has already made clear that it will accept Mr Straw's final decision on the matter and will not allow Judge Garzon to order an appeal. Amnesty International and Redress, two of the human rights organisations involved in the recent legal action, indicated they were not planning to launch any legal challenge if Mr Straw decided to free the general, while Human Rights Watch said it was waiting to see what the result was and the reasons for the decision. Pinochet has spent most of his 16 months in Britain under armed police guard at a rented mansion on the Wentworth estate in Surrey.",

The figures - requested by Andrew Tyrie, Conservative MP for Chichester and former special adviser to ex-chancellor Nigel Lawson - reveal that Downing Street now employs a record number of 149 people. Sir Richard's breakdown of the staffing figures is the first time details have been disclosed by the government on arrangements inside No 10. Mr Tyrie claimed last night that the figures showed \"that Tony Blair is well on the way to setting up a presidential style of government. \"For the first time a political appointee, Jonathan Powell, is now in total charge of Downing Street and not a senior civil servant. \"Under John Major Down ing Street was run by the principal private secretary.\" Sir Richard's figures show that compared with Mr Major's eight special advisers Labour has 29 advisers to help Tony Blair - the biggest rise in political appointments at No 10. Tony Blair's private office has increased from six staff under his predecessor to 11. Three new Downing Street units have been created.

The focus of the next 20 minutes was on Hindley's relationship with Ian Brady, a charismatic sadist who, Hindley stressed in her letters, corrupted her both sexually and morally. Again and again she cast Brady as the homicidal pervert, herself as his brainwashed disciple - if only I hadn't met him, ran the constant refrain, all would have been well. \"All I'd ever hoped for from a relationship with him was marriage and children\", Hindley said, plumbing new depths of disingenuousness. </p> <p>Hindley had no control over the editorial content of Modern Times, as was clear from the fact that, after this bout of special pleading, Staff's film shifted focus to the murders. As the stark narrative of first victim Pauline Reade's abduction and death unfolded, Hindley's excuses seemed transparent. Brady had beaten Hindley up and threatened to kill her grandmother in the days before the murder, and so \"I sacrificed Pauline so that my own family would be safe\".

Faced with the prospect of writing about the murder of fourth victim Lesley Ann Downey, whose cries for mercy were tape recorded, Hindley pleaded that the memory was still too painful for her to go into detail. Psychiatrist Malcolm MacCulloch, who has heard the tape, said that there was \"no sympathy\" in Hindley's recorded voice. Finally, the film's big question - was Hindley a brainwashed accomplice or an active perpetrator - was answered.

Why was it made at all? And why was it screened just now, when Hindley is once again challenging the home secretary's right to keep her in prison? Yes, it's extraordinary that Duncan Staff corresponded with Britain's most hated person, and fascinating to pick apart the flimsiness of Hindley's \"oh my God what have I done?\" routine.

It's 16 years old, and yet the chances are you'll never have heard of it. It's about to touch Britain when Cartoon Network launches into the middle of one of the most impenetrable, but rewarding storylines ever on Monday. </p> <p>The Dragonball saga stretched for over 500 episodes during its 10-year run in Japan, taking three series (Dragonball, Dragonball Z and Dragonball GT) to tell the story of a young boy, Goku, and his quest to find seven mystic dragon balls said to make a dragon appear and grant a wish to anyone who collects them all. </p> <p>He learns martial arts from a lecherous old man who lives with talking turtles on a tiny island in the middle of the sea, encounters a world of characters (Raditz, Lunch, Oolong, Vegeta) who all seem to be named after food and drink and intent on proving their superior power levels, measured by some of the weird technology they acquire, and along the way discovers that he's actually an alien, who arrived on Earth in a tiny space pod. </p> <p>Unlike most cartoons, whose characters are caught in a timewarp where nothing ever changes and no one ever evolves, Dragonball breaks the eternal youth rule by having the characters grow up and offering plot twists and changing elements like a manga EastEnders. Goku gets married, has a kid, and, at the start of Dragonball Z, (where, just to make things even more complicated, we join the action on Monday), finds himself fighting an evil older brother he didn't know he had. The action shifts from tiny villages to huge intergalactic vistas and back again. The Simpsons killing off Maude Flanders is nothing compared to the continual blood-letting and reincarnation that's been going on in Dragonball for years.

      "bodyText": "It's the longest-running animated series in the world, a global phenomenon shown everywhere from Spain, where its products outsold Olympic mascot merchandise during the Barcelona games, to the States, where it is the top-ranking show on the Cartoon Network across all ages (a figure that's rumoured to have attracted the attention of Disney), and there's a Dreamcast game in production, to follow the Playstation releases. It's 16 years old, and yet the chances are you'll never have heard of it. It's about to touch Britain when Cartoon Network launches into the middle of one of the most impenetrable, but rewarding storylines ever on Monday. The Dragonball saga stretched for over 500 episodes during its 10-year run in Japan, taking three series (Dragonball, Dragonball Z and Dragonball GT) to tell the story of a young boy, Goku, and his quest to find seven mystic dragon balls said to make a dragon appear and grant a wish to anyone who collects them all. He learns martial arts from a lecherous old man who lives with talking turtles on a tiny island in the middle of the sea, encounters a world of characters (Raditz, Lunch, Oolong, Vegeta) who all seem to be named after food and drink and intent on proving their superior power levels, measured by some of the weird technology they acquire, and along the way discovers that he's actually an alien, who arrived on Earth in a tiny space pod. Unlike most cartoons, whose characters are caught in a timewarp where nothing ever changes and no one ever evolves, Dragonball breaks the eternal youth rule by having the characters grow up and offering plot twists and changing elements like a manga EastEnders. Goku gets married, has a kid, and, at the start of Dragonball Z, (where, just to make things even more complicated, we join the action on Monday), finds himself fighting an evil older brother he didn't know he had. The action shifts from tiny villages to huge intergalactic vistas and back again. The Simpsons killing off Maude Flanders is nothing compared to the continual blood-letting and reincarnation that's been going on in Dragonball for years. One character, Trunks, ends up co-existing with two time-travelling versions of himself. Over the three series, Goku's hair grows into a huge mane, and turns blonde as his power level grows from Sai-Yan to Super Sai-Yan status, giving him the ability to destroy planets with his hi-kicks by the end of the series. If you're already getting confused with the divergent narrative structures in Pok\u00e9mon, then this is probably not going to get you rushing home.

In the desert sun, the researchers lost around nine-tenths of the transmitted photons, but correctly interpreted 95% of those that arrived at the detector. At night, where there are only photons from the moon, successful interpretation went up to 97%.",

So I thought I'd prefer to be remembered as the goofy guy who thought he could build a human.\" </p> <p>Goofy or not, Brooks now has a six year old robot built like a rugby player from the waist up with the brain of a six month old baby. Cog (short for Cognitive) is designed to interact socially with humans: eventually it will babble like a child and express emotions such as happiness, sadness and boredom. </p> <p>Brooks thought that if Cog had a human body, people would be likely to interact with it as if it were another person. Cog has arms, a torso, head and a neck. It has some of the same senses as us. Touch sensors on its torso and within its joints allow it to figure out how to use its arms and to make sure that when it does interact physically with people, it won't crush them. </p> <p>As Brooks says, \"Conventional robots that you'd find in a factory are very dangerous because they don't feel what's happening. If they've been told to go to a particular place, they go there, come what may, and if a body happens to be in the way, well, pretty soon blood is spurting everywhere.\" </p> <p>Not only can Cog interact with people bloodlessly, the robot turned rock child for a short while. It learned to play the drums in time with a beat, as well as swing a pendulum, turn a crank and occasionally catch a ball. But the student studying Cog's arms has graduated and the arms have ground to a halt while the new student, Bryan Adams, resurrects the software. </p> <p>Cog has an ear on either side of its head and can pin-point sounds. Brooks hopes Cog will learn to talk simply by hearing people speak to it, in exactly the same way as adults help young children learn to speak. </p> <p>Perhaps the most striking thing about Cog, apart from its sheer height, is the eerie way it watches as you walk around the lab. Cog can turn and tilt its head, neck and eyes. Currently it has four eyes: two see in a wide angle, and two focus on nearby objects, mimicking our own visual ability. </p> <p>Cog is attracted by light and movement; it also registers faces, but as yet, can't recognise individuals. It grows bored and turns away if a person stops moving, or moves monotonously. Brian Scassellati, head of vision research on Cog, has had to restrict its head movements. Next to Cog a bank of monitors show what Cog can see, and the robot found these so attractive it kept looking at itself in the monitor. </p> <p>The robot's brain is a bank of computers which operate in a similar way to our superior colliculus. This part of the brain processes vision, hear ing and touch in parallel so that if you hear a bird singing, you automatically turn to look in the direction of the sound and marry up the song with the image of the bird. </p> <p>Brooks's original brief had been to build a robot with a human-like brain, but under the guidance of his key researchers, it is becoming much more emotional. Scassellati, on reading work by Simon Baron-Cohen who studies children with autism, became interested in joint attention. Cog has the ability to watch a person or an object as it moves about the room, but it cannot yet look at what another person is looking at. This skill develops in humans at about nine months. </p> <p>Understanding that what a person is looking at is what they are paying attention to is the first step towards developing an understanding of what another person might be thinking. Autistic people do not possess this trait. Scassellati hopes Cog will be used to test hypotheses about joint attention. </p> <p>Cynthia Breazeal, another key researcher, has adapted one of Cog's old heads to create Kismet - a robot like a fleshless Disney character with giant, baby blue eyes (fitted with tiny cameras), pink ears that waggle, liquorice-red lips, and Wile E. Coyote eyebrows. Kismet can show a range of expressions: sadness, fear, happiness, surprise, disgust, anger and boredom. </p> <p> \"What I'm really trying to do is make the robot happy,\" laughs Breazeal as she plays with a toy dinosaur. At first Kismet does look happy, its lips curve into a smile and its eyebrows arch. But the dinosaur is bright yellow and has a stomach full of tinny bells. Shortly the robot begins to look annoyed, and then closes its eyes and turns its head away. </p> <p>Kismet is attracted by light, movement, and large patches of skin - its way of knowing there is a human about. It has a social drive - to interact with people - and a stimulation drive. When it is over-stimulated, a fatigue drive kicks in and it shuts itself down. Within a few seconds it opens its eyes and looks around once more, waiting to be entertained. Breazeal wants to create a robot that can be your friend. In the meantime, she has developed Kismet to encourage people to interact with it as a parent might with a child. Kismet doesn't really feel sad; in much the same way, mothers may often read far more into very young baby's behaviour than is actually present. </p> <p>Shortly Cog's prop forward frame could have the same kind of cutesie head and appealing and unpredictable display of emotional expressions. When that happens, will our view of robots and how we interact with them change dramatically? </p> <p>Will Rod Brooks just be remembered as a goofy guy who thought he could build a human? \"One of Cog's successors will have full human level performance. I don't know if I'll get to that in my lifetime,\" says Brooks, \"but one measure of success will be if my graduate students ever feel bad, truly bad in their heart about switching Cog off. At the moment they don't, it's a machine and they're people. When that boundary breaks down, then we will have succeeded.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair yesterday weighed into the row over the axeing of News at Ten, saying that concerns about the move had been borne out and that he hoped ITV would restore the programme to its original slot. It was the prime minister's most outspoken criticism of the change, a year ago next week, which saw news bulletins scheduled at 6.30pm and 11pm on weekdays, and comes as the Independent Television Commission is finalising a review of the shake-up. The Commons culture, media and sport committee, which is also conducting an inquiry into the abolition of the flagship programme, will hear today that ITV's total news audience has fallen by more than a million viewers since News at Ten was dropped. Mr Blair's intervention, during prime minister's questions in the Commons, is a sign of the fury that he and the culture, media and sport secretary, Chris Smith, feel at the change. Though he was careful to make clear that the final say on the issue lay with the ITC, he told MPs: \"I personally liked News at Ten. I also had some concerns about the likely consequences of moving it, as did many people in this house. \"I think those concerns, I'm afraid, have been largely borne out by what has happened since then.\" News at Ten had developed \"an important place in our national life. \"I fear that the decision to move it eroded that position, and I very much hope that they think again.\" ITV last night fought back against the comments, arguing that changes to a schedule of 30 years standing were always expected to take time to bed down. A spokeswoman said: \"ITV introduced a new evening schedule to halt the decline in evening peak time audiences by introducing greater diversity in the scheduling. \"We have not abandoned news: we have a flagship news programme at 6.30pm averaging audiences only just below News at Ten's audience in the same period.\" The nightly news, initially scheduled flexibly but now fixed at 11pm, was gaining consistently stronger audiences, she said. Sustained pressure from politicians, including a highly critical report before News at Ten was axed, has infuriated ITV managers, who argue that they had no choice but to tackle a 25% fall-off in audiences at 10pm. One source said: \"Politicians have subjective views about News at Ten which they don't have about the rest of the TV schedule.\" MPs generally argue that the change has resulted in reduced parliamentary coverage - though there is less drama in the Commons now that the government has a strong majority. The view is that ITV managers have bowed to pressure from advertisers and \"dumbed down\" their evening schedule. The managers, meanwhile, say that a government with one eye on an up-coming election is frustrated that it can no longer play off the BBC's flagship Nine O'Clock news against ITN's News at Ten, but must deal with an all-powerful BBC. The ITC, which resented government pressure over the News at Ten decision, is not expected to call for the change to be reversed. However, the commission, due to publish its findings in late April or May, may press ITN to consider moving the nightly news to 10.30. The watchdog body will also be acutely aware that its own future is uncertain as the government examines the issue of broadcasting regulation.",

There's no reason why a commercial organisation couldn't do this, and make money out of it. But such a site would need two things to make it different from, say, GeoCities or Freeserve. First, it would need a comprehensive, searchable directory, so that visitors who needed a product or service could find it easily. Second, it would need to provide every member with a cheap, simple e-commerce system, including a way to accept credit card payments. </p> <p>But while it might be possible to tell the DCMS what it should do, a lot of the things that need doing are the responsibility of the DTI, the home office, the DfEE, the treasury, Oftel, the data protection reg istrar, or the European Union, and so on. Some of these are clearly heading in different directions, with the home office working against the interests of e-commerce, which the DTI is trying to promote. It's nice to have an e-Envoy, but let's not pretend we've got \"joined up government\". </p> <p>The government's regulatory framework is potentially even more of a problem. When it was developed, the different mass media - print, radio, television, cinema etc - were fairly easy to separate. Today, virtually all \"content\" can be digitised and delivered over the web, so why distinguish between them? The DCMS and DTI plan to address the \"converging digital environment\" and a consultative white paper is expected in the autumn. </p> <p>But even if the task force knew all the answers and the government were prepared to act on them (which it isn't), there remains a fundamental problem: speed of execution. </p> <p>The task force completed its inquiry less than six months after it was set up, partly by doing much of the work online. But the internet has changed since then. It will have changed even more before the government has finished chewing it over. </p> <p>Patricia Hewitt, minister for small business and e-commerce at the DTI, almost admitted as much at the report's launch. \"We in government have to start moving in terms of internet years, not parliamentary years,\" she said. </p> <p>In reality internet companies revise their strategies and may change their aims every three to six months, whereas governments think about what they can do in four to five year terms. </p> <p>If the government really wants to do something, it can lead from the front. It employs vastly more people than the creative industries, and is responsible for far larger revenues. It knows it should be doing more on the net. But if the DCMS still thinks it's cool to do websites with Flash intros, frames and red text on a pink background, it's got a lot of catching up to do. </p> <p>\u0095 Creative Industries Internet Inquiry: Snapshot of a rolling wave at <a href=\"http://www.culture.gov.uk/creative/  \">www.culture.gov.uk/creative</a></p>",

But while it might be possible to tell the DCMS what it should do, a lot of the things that need doing are the responsibility of the DTI, the home office, the DfEE, the treasury, Oftel, the data protection reg istrar, or the European Union, and so on. Some of these are clearly heading in different directions, with the home office working against the interests of e-commerce, which the DTI is trying to promote. It's nice to have an e-Envoy, but let's not pretend we've got \"joined up government\". The government's regulatory framework is potentially even more of a problem. When it was developed, the different mass media - print, radio, television, cinema etc - were fairly easy to separate. Today, virtually all \"content\" can be digitised and delivered over the web, so why distinguish between them? The DCMS and DTI plan to address the \"converging digital environment\" and a consultative white paper is expected in the autumn. But even if the task force knew all the answers and the government were prepared to act on them (which it isn't), there remains a fundamental problem: speed of execution. The task force completed its inquiry less than six months after it was set up, partly by doing much of the work online. But the internet has changed since then. It will have changed even more before the government has finished chewing it over. Patricia Hewitt, minister for small business and e-commerce at the DTI, almost admitted as much at the report's launch. \"We in government have to start moving in terms of internet years, not parliamentary years,\" she said. In reality internet companies revise their strategies and may change their aims every three to six months, whereas governments think about what they can do in four to five year terms. If the government really wants to do something, it can lead from the front. It employs vastly more people than the creative industries, and is responsible for far larger revenues. It knows it should be doing more on the net. But if the DCMS still thinks it's cool to do websites with Flash intros, frames and red text on a pink background, it's got a lot of catching up to do. \u0095 Creative Industries Internet Inquiry: Snapshot of a rolling wave at www.culture.gov.uk/creative",

That's because this taxi is based in America and is also crazy. </p> <p>Actually try frenetic, hectic or maybe just frantic, as Crazy Taxi is pure videogame espresso. Its burst of intense energy is an acquired, if short-lived, taste. Simply choose your yellow steed and away you go, rushing to get your fares from A to B as quickly as possible. The faster you work, the more money you receive, with creative use of the road encouraged. </p> <p>You'll often find yourself driving through parks and cafes as the agile pedestrians jump out of the way.

That's because this taxi is based in America and is also crazy. Actually try frenetic, hectic or maybe just frantic, as Crazy Taxi is pure videogame espresso. Its burst of intense energy is an acquired, if short-lived, taste. Simply choose your yellow steed and away you go, rushing to get your fares from A to B as quickly as possible. The faster you work, the more money you receive, with creative use of the road encouraged. You'll often find yourself driving through parks and cafes as the agile pedestrians jump out of the way.

Specifically the rights regarding access to the source code. And while we are obligated to offer you the source code... To gain access to this site, you are obligated not to ask,\" he explains. Slade complains that people are asking for code but not using it to fix bugs or add features, which is the idea behind the \"open source\" approach. \"So,\"\u00b8 he adds, \"disappointed with what the community has become, I've decided to take a stand.\" Carmack understands the problem but principle is at stake. \"If necessary, I will pay whatever lawyer the Free Software Foundation recommends to pursue this,\" he says in an open letter at http://www.webdog.org/plans/1/ This may be a minor spat, but the GPL, devised by FSF-founder Richard Stallman, is the basis for the free software movement.

He shared with his mentor, John Addey, a neo-Platonic vision which roots astrology in a realm of eternal ideas, believing that astrology's harmonic periods and cycles reveal \"the moving image of eternity\".</p> <p>Harvey was born in the 14th-century Half-Moon Cottage in Little Bookham, Surrey. His tyrannical father was a scholar in mediaeval architecture and history. He was also a pagan who wore a long green cape for New Year rituals and held anarchic views on the hollowness of academia. Harvey junior attended a grammar school near Leatherhead, but had a disrupted education, and ran away at 16. When he found his way to Plato and astrology, he found his true home.</p> <p>He promoted the research of the French statisticians Fran\u00e7ois and Michelle Gauquelin on the correlation between planetary positions and professions in a database of European births. He instigated the research journal, Correlation, and an annual international research conference. The first, in 1979, featured the psychologist Hans Eysenck, who had become convinced of the empirical evidence for a correlation between planetary positions and personality.</p> <p>Harvey promoted the \"midpoint\" system developed by the German astrologer Baldur Eberin in the 1930s. This recasts traditional astrology in a modern rational framework of cosmo-biological influences. He collaborated with historians Michael Baigent and Nicholas Campion on mundane astrology, the study of nations and politics, and published on financial astrology with Michael Harding. With his wife Suzi, also an astrologer, he wrote two books for newcomers to the subject.</p> <p>Harvey was a tireless ambassador for astrology, and was frequently called on to deal with astrology's bad reputation. His everyday work ranged from an anonymous stint as Old Moore to discreet consultancy work for an international clientele. In 1998 a benefactor enabled him to initiate the Sophia Project, under the aegis of the the astrological charity, the Urania Trust. This aims to advance the study of \"real astrology in higher education\", and it is finding small niches for serious astrology within academia.</p> <p>He often quoted the catch-phrase from theosophical astrology, \"unity in diversity\". This attitude is shown in his birthchart. The Sun is in the nurturing sign of Cancer, in the 11th house of groups, with a humanitarian Moon in Aquarius in the 6th house of service.</p> <p>He was vice-president of the Faculty of Astrological Studies (1977-86), an internationally recognised teaching body, a founder trustee of the Urania Trust and co-director of the Centre For Psychological Astrology since 1992.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife Suzi, sons Giles and Alexander, and daughter Natasha.</p>",

Harvey was born in the 14th-century Half-Moon Cottage in Little Bookham, Surrey. His tyrannical father was a scholar in mediaeval architecture and history. He was also a pagan who wore a long green cape for New Year rituals and held anarchic views on the hollowness of academia. Harvey junior attended a grammar school near Leatherhead, but had a disrupted education, and ran away at 16. When he found his way to Plato and astrology, he found his true home. He promoted the research of the French statisticians Fran\u00e7ois and Michelle Gauquelin on the correlation between planetary positions and professions in a database of European births. He instigated the research journal, Correlation, and an annual international research conference. The first, in 1979, featured the psychologist Hans Eysenck, who had become convinced of the empirical evidence for a correlation between planetary positions and personality. Harvey promoted the \"midpoint\" system developed by the German astrologer Baldur Eberin in the 1930s. This recasts traditional astrology in a modern rational framework of cosmo-biological influences. He collaborated with historians Michael Baigent and Nicholas Campion on mundane astrology, the study of nations and politics, and published on financial astrology with Michael Harding. With his wife Suzi, also an astrologer, he wrote two books for newcomers to the subject. Harvey was a tireless ambassador for astrology, and was frequently called on to deal with astrology's bad reputation. His everyday work ranged from an anonymous stint as Old Moore to discreet consultancy work for an international clientele. In 1998 a benefactor enabled him to initiate the Sophia Project, under the aegis of the the astrological charity, the Urania Trust. This aims to advance the study of \"real astrology in higher education\", and it is finding small niches for serious astrology within academia. He often quoted the catch-phrase from theosophical astrology, \"unity in diversity\". This attitude is shown in his birthchart. The Sun is in the nurturing sign of Cancer, in the 11th house of groups, with a humanitarian Moon in Aquarius in the 6th house of service. He was vice-president of the Faculty of Astrological Studies (1977-86), an internationally recognised teaching body, a founder trustee of the Urania Trust and co-director of the Centre For Psychological Astrology since 1992. He is survived by his wife Suzi, sons Giles and Alexander, and daughter Natasha.",

      "bodyText": "Even though Sandy Kaufman had been reading about rising oil prices, she was shocked by her latest heating bill: the monthly fee of $180 (\u00a3114) had more than doubled to $460. In the past two weeks, she has turned the thermostat down by about five degrees in the family home in Long Island, New York. \"What else can you do?\" says the mother of two. \"We have to have heat and warm water.\" American consumers are accustomed to having fairly cheap fuel and using it freely. The sharp increase in oil prices has taken them by surprise. Lower US fuel taxes may have kept prices below those in most of Europe, but the rise in what producers are charging for crude oil has still hit the family purse. When Ms Kaufman bought a new car a few weeks ago, she chose a fuel-efficient hatchback rather than one of the big gas-guzzling sports utility vehicles popular with her neighbours. \"My cousin spends [\u00a325] every time he fills up the tank,\" she says, incredulously. Car makers are worried that the 40% rise in the cost of unleaded petrol during the past year will hit the sales of big cars. Some consumers have also delayed holiday plans because of a 7.5% rise in air fares during the past year. Social service agencies in the US north-east have been inundated with calls for help from low-income people in recent weeks because of the sharp rise in their heating bills. The situation is particularly acute in this region of the US because it has 75% of the nation's oil-heated homes. New York state alone represents 20% of the domestic heating-oil market. Others to be affected by rising prices include truckers and owners of small businesses, some of whom are taking their complaints to Washington. But so far, consumers have been apathetic. In the past few weeks, salesmen have been going door to door in the north-east trying to persuade people in residential homes like the Kaufmans' to switch to natural gas. They are offering incentives such as free installation or cheap cooker conversion, but Ms Kaufman and many of her neighbours have decided to wait and see whether oil prices levels out before they decide. \"I wonder how long this is going to be like this?\" she says. \"You have to spend a lot of money to convert to gas.\"",

      "body": "<p>The foliage and fountains decorating the marble foyer of a state hospital in Jeddah typify the elaborate architecture of the carefree years of Saudi Arabia's oil boom from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s.</p> <p>But if this medical centre on the Red Sea coast is the physical embodiment of earlier boom times, it also represents the slumps that have periodically hit the world's largest oil exporter during the later 1980s and through the 1990s.</p> <p>Doctors at the hospital complain that parts of this fancy edifice became, in reality, an empty shell because operating revenues fell off as lavish state funding faded in recent years.</p> <p>A dialysis unit, bought with money donated by a member of the ruling family, \"stopped working because there isn't enough money to keep it going\", a Saudi doctor said. \"When we sit with administrators and come up with plans and requests they say, 'How can we do all of this? We don't have the money for it'.\"</p> <p>But after a surge year for oil prices, everybody is hoping that the good old days are about to return, the days when the kingdom was flush with oil cash, and the hospital's corridors were bustling with nurses and technicians from the west.</p> <p>When oil prices tumbled, the western expatriates, along with their high salaries and other benefits, were replaced by cheaper expertise from the Indian subcontinent, east Asia and neighbouring Arab countries. The government began threatening to replace expatriate workers - who make up a third of the country's population of 18m - with Saudis.</p> <p>Now a huge sigh of relief can be heard as oil prices climb to their highest levels in almost 10 years, and no wonder: Saudi Arabia depends on oil for at least 70% of its revenues.</p> <p>\"A year ago, people were thoroughly miserable,\" said a western diplomat in the capital, Riyadh. \"This started to change in September. We hear from everyone we speak to in the business community that people are much more confident than a year ago.\"</p> <p>The past year's rise in oil prices has yet to work its way through to produce an economic turn-round. \"There's always a time lag,\" the diplomat said, \"but we're seeing the beginning of the curve of increase in economic activity.\"</p> <p>Construction, he argued, was a key indicator. \"Although there aren't any major projects, contacts say a lot of projects are about to leave the drawing board and we expect things to pick up.\"</p> <p>This is music to the ears of a country that has not proved very good at adapting to budget deficits and the prospect of an end to cradle-to-grave state services. In 1998 oil prices hit their lowest point in 12 years. The 1990-91 Gulf war had already cost the Saudis an estimated $55bn (\u00a335bn at current rates) and periods of recession in the west and Asia made demand weak for the abundant supply of petroleum flowing at the time.</p> <p>Every time a barrel of oil drops by $1, it is said to cost Saudi Arabia about $2.5bn in annual revenue.</p> <p>But following Opec's decision in March last year to restrict oil supplies, the months of rising prices led the Saudi British Bank to predict in December that Saudi Arabia's budget for 2000 would project a deficit of about $3bn, sharply lower than the $12bn foreseen for the 1999 budget.</p> <p>It said: \"Government expenditure is still fairly tight despite oil prices that are up on last year. The focus is on things like health, education and housing projects. It is not on defence or on infrastructure.\"</p> <p>A report last month by the Saudi American Bank predicted big economic changes this year if, as expected, Saudi Arabia is admitted to the World Trade Organisation.

      "bodyText": "The foliage and fountains decorating the marble foyer of a state hospital in Jeddah typify the elaborate architecture of the carefree years of Saudi Arabia's oil boom from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s. But if this medical centre on the Red Sea coast is the physical embodiment of earlier boom times, it also represents the slumps that have periodically hit the world's largest oil exporter during the later 1980s and through the 1990s. Doctors at the hospital complain that parts of this fancy edifice became, in reality, an empty shell because operating revenues fell off as lavish state funding faded in recent years. A dialysis unit, bought with money donated by a member of the ruling family, \"stopped working because there isn't enough money to keep it going\", a Saudi doctor said. \"When we sit with administrators and come up with plans and requests they say, 'How can we do all of this? We don't have the money for it'.\" But after a surge year for oil prices, everybody is hoping that the good old days are about to return, the days when the kingdom was flush with oil cash, and the hospital's corridors were bustling with nurses and technicians from the west. When oil prices tumbled, the western expatriates, along with their high salaries and other benefits, were replaced by cheaper expertise from the Indian subcontinent, east Asia and neighbouring Arab countries. The government began threatening to replace expatriate workers - who make up a third of the country's population of 18m - with Saudis. Now a huge sigh of relief can be heard as oil prices climb to their highest levels in almost 10 years, and no wonder: Saudi Arabia depends on oil for at least 70% of its revenues. \"A year ago, people were thoroughly miserable,\" said a western diplomat in the capital, Riyadh. \"This started to change in September. We hear from everyone we speak to in the business community that people are much more confident than a year ago.\" The past year's rise in oil prices has yet to work its way through to produce an economic turn-round. \"There's always a time lag,\" the diplomat said, \"but we're seeing the beginning of the curve of increase in economic activity.\" Construction, he argued, was a key indicator. \"Although there aren't any major projects, contacts say a lot of projects are about to leave the drawing board and we expect things to pick up.\" This is music to the ears of a country that has not proved very good at adapting to budget deficits and the prospect of an end to cradle-to-grave state services. In 1998 oil prices hit their lowest point in 12 years. The 1990-91 Gulf war had already cost the Saudis an estimated $55bn (\u00a335bn at current rates) and periods of recession in the west and Asia made demand weak for the abundant supply of petroleum flowing at the time. Every time a barrel of oil drops by $1, it is said to cost Saudi Arabia about $2.5bn in annual revenue. But following Opec's decision in March last year to restrict oil supplies, the months of rising prices led the Saudi British Bank to predict in December that Saudi Arabia's budget for 2000 would project a deficit of about $3bn, sharply lower than the $12bn foreseen for the 1999 budget. It said: \"Government expenditure is still fairly tight despite oil prices that are up on last year. The focus is on things like health, education and housing projects. It is not on defence or on infrastructure.\" A report last month by the Saudi American Bank predicted big economic changes this year if, as expected, Saudi Arabia is admitted to the World Trade Organisation. It foresaw a greater opening to foreign investment and con tinuing attempts at domestic reforms. Higher oil revenues might have helped the economy in 1999, said the Saudi American Bank, but the government still had other issues to tackle - including high state debt, low capital spending on infrastructure and growing unemployment. It called youth unemployment an \"emerging problem\", saying that 15%-20% of Saudis aged 20-29 were jobless. Even during the years of plunging oil prices, no one said Saudi Arabia had become poor. From swanky cars to designer labels, the evidence of oil riches remains abundant. Although oil prices are picking up, no one is expecting a 1970s-style bonanza. Crown Prince Abdullah told Gulf leaders last year to accept the reality: \"The oil boom is finished,\" he said, \"so get over it.\"",

Foreign journalists are not able to visit Tibet independently to verify stories. </p> <p>Recent travellers to Tibet found that Tsurphu monastery, seat of the 17th Karmapa, was closed to visitors. Monks had been warned to improve their \"political attitudes\". </p> <p>TIN sources claim that China has mounted an intense security-operation to find out how the 14-year-old Karmapa, spiritual head of the Kagyupa - one of Tibet's four main Buddhist schools - travelled from Tsurphu to the Nepalese border. </p> <p>Contrary to early reports, he did not walk the whole way but travelled in a jeep, leaving it when necessary to walk or climb around Chinese checkpoints. </p> <p>The Karmapa is now staying at a monastery near Dharamsala, headquarters of the Dalai Lama. John Gittings, Hong Kong </p> <p><b> Meat ban triggers violence</b><br> </p> <p> An EU ban on importing meat from Morocco has sparked a wave of racial unrest among the Muslim population in the north African enclave of Melilla. </p> <p>Dozens of young Muslims went on the rampage in protest at the ban, which seeks to limit the spread of foot-and-mouth disease from north Africa to Europe. </p> <p>They insist that lamb imported from the Spanish mainland is no substitute for Moroccan mutton traditionally sacrificed to celebrate the feast of Aid El Kabir, the second most important in the Muslim calendar after Ramadan. </p> <p>The youths set fire to rubbish containers, barricaded streets and threw stones at police patrolling Muslim areas of the city following violent clashes between Moroccan immigrants and the indigenous population in Almeria, in southern Spain, two weeks ago. </p> <p>Mustafa Aberchan, the president of Melilla, a 4.6 sq mile-area surrounding a coastal fortress which was seized by Spain 500 years ago, said the protests were a deliberate attempt to destabilise the territory. </p> <p>\"There are political forces that want to undermine the racial harmony we enjoy,\" said President Mustafa. </p> <p>The protest coincided with the first visit to Spain by Morocco's king Mohamed VI yesterday to meet King Juan Carlos and the Spanish prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar. </p> <p>Relations between Spain and Melilla have been strained over the clashes in Almeria, Spanish farmers' refusal to allow Moroccan produce to enter the EU through Spain and renegotiations of an agreement on fishing rights. </p> <p>AP, Melilla </p> <p><b> Aum link to defence computers</b><br> </p> <p> Japan said yesterday that its government ministries would stop using computer software developed with the doomsday cult accused of a fatal 1995 gas attack on the Tokyo subway. </p> <p>The discovery of the software in computer systems at a number of ministries and several major private companies came a day before the systems were due to be activated at the defence ministry. </p> <p>The embarrassing discovery that members of the Aum Shinrikyo (Supreme Truth) cult had been involved in designing the software came after a series of hacker raids on government computers in January and leap year computer glitches on Tuesday. </p> <p>Analysts said the cult may have been close to infiltrating government computers and obtaining vital information, including on defence. </p> <p>In the 1995 gas attack on Tokyo's tube system, 12 people were killed and thousands injured. Aum preached that the world was coming to an end and the cult must arm itself. </p> <p>Defence officials said they had been unaware of the possible Aum link and had had no direct contract with the cult. But they said Aum members had helped install the new system. </p> <p>Computer experts said this could have given Aum a back door into defence networks. </p> <p>\"Aum could have done anything - install mechanisms inside the network to allow them remote access or even to create a network malfunction,\" said the president of the Artemis computer security firm, Hideharu Ishikawa. </p> <p>Introduction of the software system had been postponed indefinitely, pending checks, defence officials said. </p> <p>While classified military and other strategic information was stored in a secure computer network, Aum could have read email exchanges between the ministry and outside networks, Mr Ishikawa said. </p> <p>The computer business has been a major source of income for Aum, which used to run a string of discount computer shops. It is believed to have shifted recently to software development. </p> <p>Because Aum used related companies and acted as a subcontractor, ministries would have been unaware of the Aum connection, computer experts said. </p> <p>The transactions were listed in documents found in a police raid on an Aum-linked company on Tuesday. </p> <p>Reuters, Tokyo </p> <p><b> Gadafy abolishes ministries</b><br> </p> <p> The Libyan government yesterday scrapped most of its ministries and transferred most of their duties to the provinces in a move reflecting Colonel Muammar Gadafy's dissatisfaction with the outgoing cabinet's economic policies. </p> <p>The energy ministry was among 12 to be scrapped and their powers devolved to provincial committees or other bodies. The key ministries of defence and foreign affairs will remain under central supervision. </p> <p>The defence ministry has always been kept out of government control and is run by Col Gadafy's allies. </p> <p>Energy policy in the major oil-producing state will be supervised by the prime ministry, which will also supervise the ministries of foreign affairs, African unity, finance, information and tourism, justice and public order. </p> <p>The restructuring was approved by the general people's congress (GPC) during debates broadcast by Libyan state television. </p> <p>On January 28 Col Gadafy unexpectedly attended the GPC's opening session and tore up the 2000 draft budget, ordering it to be revised and the congress postponed. </p> <p>He said he was unhappy with the government's reliance on oil revenues instead of diversifying the economy. Oil revenues account for nearly 95% of Libya's foreign exchange income. </p> <p>The congress, which resumed its session on Sunday, had approved the revised 2000 budget which sharply reduced the use of oil revenues. Spending would be cut to 3bn dinars (\u00a34.2bn) in 2000 from 3.5bn dinars in 1999. Only 20% would come from oil revenues. Reuters, Tunis</p>",

The 14th Karmapa's father and mother were said to have been taken away from their home in Lhasa and put under surveillance in the eastern Chamdo region, where they were previously nomadic yak herders. A Chinese government spokesman in Lhasa yesterday denied the report by the London-based Tibet Information Network (TIN), calling it \"rumour\". Foreign journalists are not able to visit Tibet independently to verify stories. Recent travellers to Tibet found that Tsurphu monastery, seat of the 17th Karmapa, was closed to visitors. Monks had been warned to improve their \"political attitudes\". TIN sources claim that China has mounted an intense security-operation to find out how the 14-year-old Karmapa, spiritual head of the Kagyupa - one of Tibet's four main Buddhist schools - travelled from Tsurphu to the Nepalese border. Contrary to early reports, he did not walk the whole way but travelled in a jeep, leaving it when necessary to walk or climb around Chinese checkpoints. The Karmapa is now staying at a monastery near Dharamsala, headquarters of the Dalai Lama. John Gittings, Hong Kong Meat ban triggers violence An EU ban on importing meat from Morocco has sparked a wave of racial unrest among the Muslim population in the north African enclave of Melilla. Dozens of young Muslims went on the rampage in protest at the ban, which seeks to limit the spread of foot-and-mouth disease from north Africa to Europe. They insist that lamb imported from the Spanish mainland is no substitute for Moroccan mutton traditionally sacrificed to celebrate the feast of Aid El Kabir, the second most important in the Muslim calendar after Ramadan. The youths set fire to rubbish containers, barricaded streets and threw stones at police patrolling Muslim areas of the city following violent clashes between Moroccan immigrants and the indigenous population in Almeria, in southern Spain, two weeks ago. Mustafa Aberchan, the president of Melilla, a 4.6 sq mile-area surrounding a coastal fortress which was seized by Spain 500 years ago, said the protests were a deliberate attempt to destabilise the territory. \"There are political forces that want to undermine the racial harmony we enjoy,\" said President Mustafa. The protest coincided with the first visit to Spain by Morocco's king Mohamed VI yesterday to meet King Juan Carlos and the Spanish prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar. Relations between Spain and Melilla have been strained over the clashes in Almeria, Spanish farmers' refusal to allow Moroccan produce to enter the EU through Spain and renegotiations of an agreement on fishing rights. AP, Melilla Aum link to defence computers Japan said yesterday that its government ministries would stop using computer software developed with the doomsday cult accused of a fatal 1995 gas attack on the Tokyo subway. The discovery of the software in computer systems at a number of ministries and several major private companies came a day before the systems were due to be activated at the defence ministry. The embarrassing discovery that members of the Aum Shinrikyo (Supreme Truth) cult had been involved in designing the software came after a series of hacker raids on government computers in January and leap year computer glitches on Tuesday. Analysts said the cult may have been close to infiltrating government computers and obtaining vital information, including on defence. In the 1995 gas attack on Tokyo's tube system, 12 people were killed and thousands injured. Aum preached that the world was coming to an end and the cult must arm itself. Defence officials said they had been unaware of the possible Aum link and had had no direct contract with the cult. But they said Aum members had helped install the new system. Computer experts said this could have given Aum a back door into defence networks. \"Aum could have done anything - install mechanisms inside the network to allow them remote access or even to create a network malfunction,\" said the president of the Artemis computer security firm, Hideharu Ishikawa. Introduction of the software system had been postponed indefinitely, pending checks, defence officials said. While classified military and other strategic information was stored in a secure computer network, Aum could have read email exchanges between the ministry and outside networks, Mr Ishikawa said. The computer business has been a major source of income for Aum, which used to run a string of discount computer shops. It is believed to have shifted recently to software development. Because Aum used related companies and acted as a subcontractor, ministries would have been unaware of the Aum connection, computer experts said. The transactions were listed in documents found in a police raid on an Aum-linked company on Tuesday. Reuters, Tokyo Gadafy abolishes ministries The Libyan government yesterday scrapped most of its ministries and transferred most of their duties to the provinces in a move reflecting Colonel Muammar Gadafy's dissatisfaction with the outgoing cabinet's economic policies. The energy ministry was among 12 to be scrapped and their powers devolved to provincial committees or other bodies. The key ministries of defence and foreign affairs will remain under central supervision. The defence ministry has always been kept out of government control and is run by Col Gadafy's allies. Energy policy in the major oil-producing state will be supervised by the prime ministry, which will also supervise the ministries of foreign affairs, African unity, finance, information and tourism, justice and public order. The restructuring was approved by the general people's congress (GPC) during debates broadcast by Libyan state television. On January 28 Col Gadafy unexpectedly attended the GPC's opening session and tore up the 2000 draft budget, ordering it to be revised and the congress postponed. He said he was unhappy with the government's reliance on oil revenues instead of diversifying the economy. Oil revenues account for nearly 95% of Libya's foreign exchange income. The congress, which resumed its session on Sunday, had approved the revised 2000 budget which sharply reduced the use of oil revenues. Spending would be cut to 3bn dinars (\u00a34.2bn) in 2000 from 3.5bn dinars in 1999. Only 20% would come from oil revenues. Reuters, Tunis",

      "body": "<p>Jeremy Marks sits in the shadows in a small office in the leafy suburban outskirts of Watford in Hertfordshire. He wears a white sweater with a pastel design, which looks rather incongruous against the austere black and white picture of Jesus hanging on the wall behind him. On the bookshelves in the next room are several copies of a paperback book, Homosexual No More, and Marks's desk is piled high with what he describes as terribly moving letters from homosexual men asking for his help.</p> <p>These rooms, in a nondescript three-storey office block, house the \"ministry\" of the Courage Trust. Here Marks spends his days trying to help men overcome their homosexuality, because the gospel according to the trust is that men become gay through circumstance, not birth, and their erotic desires are the product of arrested development.</p> <p>Marks says that he is full of compassion for such men, who, he believes, have to spend most of their lives fighting their homosexual demons. It was a quest for release from such \"inappropriate\" yearnings and a desperate need for acceptance by God that led him to the American evangelical \"ex-gay\" movement, which burst into the public consciousness in 1998 when 15 conservative organisations began a \u00a3300,000 advertising blitz in the US. Newspaper advertisements carried photographs of men and women who had apparently struggled with same-sex attraction, but managed to walk away from their homosexual identities.</p> <p>The Courage Trust, which Marks set up in Britain in the 80s, was inspired largely by the work of America's National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality. There, campaigners are keen on public declarations of conversion. The testimonies of those such as John Paulk, a former female impersonator, are enthusiastically publicised. Paulk was attending a gay pride demonstration in Ohio when he saw boards carried by anti-gay demonstrators reading \"God hates fags\" and \"Turn or Burn\". He says he felt sick and that was the beginning of his conversion. Another famous case is that of Steve Simmons, who spent the early years of his marriage having illicit encounters with other men to satisfy his cravings, but found salvation through the ex-gay movement. He says he is now happy to live as a heterosexual.</p> <p>Listening to Marks talk of a life in which he felt anguished about his longing for sexual intimacy with other men and the belief that he could never be accepted by God, it is perhaps possible to understand the appeal of the full-on evangelical fervour of the US movement. Marks had a Christian upbringing - he was an Anglican choirboy - and realised well before puberty that he \"had erotic attraction to the same sex. It was very disturbing and not what I wanted.\"</p> <p>As his yearnings grew, so did his sense of self-loathing. He became more deeply involved with the church, and the words of Leviticus - \"Do not lie with a male as one lies with a female; that is detestable\" - preyed on his mind. Even so, Marks found himself going to gay clubs where, in his mid 20s, he met a man with whom he had a short-lived relationship. As he remembers, his gently creased face softens. \"I wanted to experience what it was like to have some intimacy - it was wonderful.\"</p> <p>At the time, he says, he thought: \"This really is me, what's the point of fighting it?\" But then came the crushing guilt. \"My faith was telling me to deny my urges, suppress them while I had a hunger for intimate relationships.\"</p> <p>Much of the theory touted by the ex-gay movement and the Courage Trust stems from a book by Elizabeth Moberley, Homosexuality and the Christian Ethic, in which she argues that gay men are trying to compensate for an inadequate bond with their father, so that they are constantly seeking men as replacement father figures. The challenge for these men, she argues, is to form close, loving but celibate relationships with other men so that they can develop beyond expressing their feelings in a sexual way.</p> <p>Marks claims that in the vast majority of cases where a father has been weak, unsatisfactory or largely absent and a mother \"domineering or controlling\", men find themselves drawn to other men. However, according to US psychologists who have monitored the ex-gay movement, men who see their homosexuality as an aberration frequently come from deeply authoritarian backgrounds where it is considered immoral or sinful, while others have married but cannot reconcile their family commitments with their feelings.</p> <p>So how does the ex-gay movement try to make men straight? In the US, there are residential programmes such as the one held by Love in Action, which Marks attended for a year. During that time he lived in an all-male, avowedly celibate house. The non-residential programmes he runs in Watford, held three evenings a month throughout the year, with a residential weekend at the beginning and end, follow the US form with Bible readings, confessional sessions where men can admit to lapses, fantasies and feelings they find difficult to overcome. The idea is that the men can offer each other loving, intimate but celibate friendship and that this will compensate for the loss of bonding with the father figure during childhood, enabling them to move on beyond their homosexuality.</p> <p>But it doesn't necessarily work, says Andrew Daws, who joined the Courage Trust programme in 1989. He speaks warmly of Marks, describing him as a caring and sincere man, but the programmed didn't change Daws's life. At the first residential weekend, he recalls: \"We all stated that our goal was to be married or at least to be able to suppress or ignore our homosexual impulses. But although week after week at the evening meetings we confessed to yet another cottaging lapse or our inability to keep thoughts in check, a veil was drawn over the number of illicit liaisons among members and the number who 'went back to the scene'. At the final weekend we said we had been ambitious in hoping that our problems would go away.\"</p> <p>And now? \"Suffice to say that we all still have homosexual feelings.\"</p> <p>Daws had spent 30 years longing to be free of his homosexual desires. He had a Christian upbringing and was sent to a boarding school for boys where he recalls \"rutting like a rabbit and repenting afterwards\". At Cambridge university he was \"prodigiously sexually active\" and guilt-ridden to the point of despair. He married and had \"an unspeakably awful\" divorce five years later .</p> <p>Involvement with the US ex-gay movement did not help and so Daws grabbed at Marks's offer, when he met him, to help \"finally reconcile my sexuality with my Christianity\" by changing his sexuality.</p> <p>Marks acknowledges that there are men who do not emerge from the programme fully \"healed\".</p> <p>\"It is part of the journey,\" he says. But he claims many have gone through his programme and come out at peace. Look at him, he says. He has \"matured\" to the point where he has been married for nine years to a woman, which has removed \"practical temptation\" and given him \"a sense of peace with who I am\".</p> <p>Opponents of the movement believe there is something fundamentally dangerous and damaging in the idea that a homosexual identity may be processed away. The Reverend Richard Kirker (described by Marks as his \"flamboyant opposite number\"), who runs the Gay and Lesbian Christian Association, says he is \"gay to the core of my being and very happy with it\". He dismisses the idea that God and homosexuality don't mix. He believes God is more all-embracing than organisations like the Courage Trust will allow and snorts with laughter at the way they isolate biblical passages to target homosexuals. \"The Bible has never been used as an infallible guide. If it were, Christians should stone adulterers to death, refuse to wear clothes of mixed fibre or eat shellfish. What people like Marks are doing is using the Bible in a fundamentalist way to overlay their prejudices and its making a lot of gays very unhappy.\"</p> <p>Kirker has no doubt that some men and women are born homosexual and that it is \"a human sexuality which in all its richness is a gift of God to be accepted, enjoyed and honoured as a way of expressing love and entirely compatible with the Christian faith\".</p> <p>He sees the ex-gay movement as homophobia disguised as compassion, fuelled by a fundamental loathing of homosexuality which gains credence through their belief that gays are aberrant men who could and should be heterosexual. He talks of the men who come to the Gay and Lesbian Christian Association in crisis after \"failing\" on an ex-gay programme. He cites a recent television documentary which featured people who had been through various ex-gay programmes and afterwards felt such disgust at the urges they were unable to resist that they tried to cut off their genitals. \"The ex-gay movement is dangerous and misguided. There's no such thing as a cured or ex-homosexual.\"</p> <p>Daws agrees. Looking back he believes \"what was started by my earlier teaching was reinforced and given credence by the ex-gay movement so that for 30 years I learned to deny my emotions and to punish myself endlessly for being unable to control my demonic behaviour\".</p> <p>For him the breakthrough has been finding a way to be homosexual and accepted by God. It happened in San Francisco. \"I met happy, well-adjusted gay men, and ones who were Christian as well. I went to the Metropolitan community church - a wonderful pink building full of flamboyant fags singing show tunes and I found really warm supportive spirituality and I never looked back.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Marks sits in the shadows in a small office in the leafy suburban outskirts of Watford in Hertfordshire. He wears a white sweater with a pastel design, which looks rather incongruous against the austere black and white picture of Jesus hanging on the wall behind him. On the bookshelves in the next room are several copies of a paperback book, Homosexual No More, and Marks's desk is piled high with what he describes as terribly moving letters from homosexual men asking for his help. These rooms, in a nondescript three-storey office block, house the \"ministry\" of the Courage Trust. Here Marks spends his days trying to help men overcome their homosexuality, because the gospel according to the trust is that men become gay through circumstance, not birth, and their erotic desires are the product of arrested development. Marks says that he is full of compassion for such men, who, he believes, have to spend most of their lives fighting their homosexual demons. It was a quest for release from such \"inappropriate\" yearnings and a desperate need for acceptance by God that led him to the American evangelical \"ex-gay\" movement, which burst into the public consciousness in 1998 when 15 conservative organisations began a \u00a3300,000 advertising blitz in the US. Newspaper advertisements carried photographs of men and women who had apparently struggled with same-sex attraction, but managed to walk away from their homosexual identities. The Courage Trust, which Marks set up in Britain in the 80s, was inspired largely by the work of America's National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality. There, campaigners are keen on public declarations of conversion. The testimonies of those such as John Paulk, a former female impersonator, are enthusiastically publicised. Paulk was attending a gay pride demonstration in Ohio when he saw boards carried by anti-gay demonstrators reading \"God hates fags\" and \"Turn or Burn\". He says he felt sick and that was the beginning of his conversion. Another famous case is that of Steve Simmons, who spent the early years of his marriage having illicit encounters with other men to satisfy his cravings, but found salvation through the ex-gay movement. He says he is now happy to live as a heterosexual. Listening to Marks talk of a life in which he felt anguished about his longing for sexual intimacy with other men and the belief that he could never be accepted by God, it is perhaps possible to understand the appeal of the full-on evangelical fervour of the US movement. Marks had a Christian upbringing - he was an Anglican choirboy - and realised well before puberty that he \"had erotic attraction to the same sex. It was very disturbing and not what I wanted.\" As his yearnings grew, so did his sense of self-loathing. He became more deeply involved with the church, and the words of Leviticus - \"Do not lie with a male as one lies with a female; that is detestable\" - preyed on his mind. Even so, Marks found himself going to gay clubs where, in his mid 20s, he met a man with whom he had a short-lived relationship. As he remembers, his gently creased face softens. \"I wanted to experience what it was like to have some intimacy - it was wonderful.\" At the time, he says, he thought: \"This really is me, what's the point of fighting it?\" But then came the crushing guilt. \"My faith was telling me to deny my urges, suppress them while I had a hunger for intimate relationships.\" Much of the theory touted by the ex-gay movement and the Courage Trust stems from a book by Elizabeth Moberley, Homosexuality and the Christian Ethic, in which she argues that gay men are trying to compensate for an inadequate bond with their father, so that they are constantly seeking men as replacement father figures.

However, according to US psychologists who have monitored the ex-gay movement, men who see their homosexuality as an aberration frequently come from deeply authoritarian backgrounds where it is considered immoral or sinful, while others have married but cannot reconcile their family commitments with their feelings.

      "body": "<p>When Prince Charles visited the slums of Trench Town in Jamaica this week, it was widely agreed that only the second coming of reggae king Bob Marley could have generated more excitement among the islanders.</p> <p>For many watching back home, however, it all seemed a bit embarrassing. Why did Charles insist on putting a rasta hat on backwards, and not once but three times? Rather predictably, yesterday's papers had little to say about how the population of the impoverished area was working to shed its \"yardie\" image of crime and deprivation. Or how everyone there loved the prince. There were just lots and lots of words about the hat.</p> <p>And, of course, the rasta hat wasn't the first evidence of Silly Hat Syndrome to emerge on the royal tour. Each day, Charles seemed determined to don an increasingly clownish headdress. What else could he do but accept the gift of a crown of eagle feathers from the Surama tribe in the Guyanese rainforests last weekend? But did the safari-suited prince really then have to dance around to Amerindian music, wearing what was essentially a bird's nest on his head? And then there was the British Gas hard hat, and not one but two ugly incidents involving baseball caps, none of which went unmentioned in the British press.</p> <p>It all must be pretty frustrating for a man determined to be taken seriously - and he must have known how it would play back home - so why did he do it?</p> <p>Part of the answer is that what we read about royal tours tends to be somewhat distorted. The first thing that may not have come across is that in the countries Charles has visited, he has been hailed a hero. In each state - Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana and Jamaica - the reaction has been the same: cheering crowds, saturation media coverage and universal approval. While the prince's enthusiasm has earned him ridicule at home, there it went down an absolute storm. Local journalists were utterly amazed that a man whom they had understood to be aloof and arrogant could display such warmth and understanding. For them, the photo opportunities are not the PR stunts they may have appeared to be back in London.</p> <p>In any case, British newspapers are in a tricky position when it comes to criticising Charles for playing the performing monkey. We, the journalists, stunted many of the pictures that have gained most prominence from this Caribbean tour: we persuaded the deprived children in Port of Spain to hand a baseball cap to Charles, reporters and photographers encouraged Rita Marley, Bob's widow, to give the rasta hats to the prince and goaded him into trying one on; the media made sure that a line-up of sexy limbo dancers was just in shot as the prince left a culture performance staged in his honour.</p> <p>So is it really fair to set him up, only to use the stunt as an excuse to knock him down later? The royal reporters travelling with the prince's party believe so; after all, the prince doesn't have to put on the hats, he has no obligation to talk to the parrots, and he didn't need to play the pan drums in such a ridiculous fashion. \"He's been doing this job for 30 years; he should know by now,\" says one experienced hack.</p> <p>It is indeed obvious that Charles must have a shrewd understanding of how the media works - after all, he's managed to completely revamp his image since his ex-wife's death - and he knows that without a picture, the stories of his tour would never make the papers at all, let alone the front pages.

      "bodyText": "When Prince Charles visited the slums of Trench Town in Jamaica this week, it was widely agreed that only the second coming of reggae king Bob Marley could have generated more excitement among the islanders. For many watching back home, however, it all seemed a bit embarrassing. Why did Charles insist on putting a rasta hat on backwards, and not once but three times? Rather predictably, yesterday's papers had little to say about how the population of the impoverished area was working to shed its \"yardie\" image of crime and deprivation. Or how everyone there loved the prince. There were just lots and lots of words about the hat. And, of course, the rasta hat wasn't the first evidence of Silly Hat Syndrome to emerge on the royal tour. Each day, Charles seemed determined to don an increasingly clownish headdress. What else could he do but accept the gift of a crown of eagle feathers from the Surama tribe in the Guyanese rainforests last weekend? But did the safari-suited prince really then have to dance around to Amerindian music, wearing what was essentially a bird's nest on his head? And then there was the British Gas hard hat, and not one but two ugly incidents involving baseball caps, none of which went unmentioned in the British press. It all must be pretty frustrating for a man determined to be taken seriously - and he must have known how it would play back home - so why did he do it? Part of the answer is that what we read about royal tours tends to be somewhat distorted. The first thing that may not have come across is that in the countries Charles has visited, he has been hailed a hero. In each state - Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana and Jamaica - the reaction has been the same: cheering crowds, saturation media coverage and universal approval. While the prince's enthusiasm has earned him ridicule at home, there it went down an absolute storm. Local journalists were utterly amazed that a man whom they had understood to be aloof and arrogant could display such warmth and understanding. For them, the photo opportunities are not the PR stunts they may have appeared to be back in London. In any case, British newspapers are in a tricky position when it comes to criticising Charles for playing the performing monkey. We, the journalists, stunted many of the pictures that have gained most prominence from this Caribbean tour: we persuaded the deprived children in Port of Spain to hand a baseball cap to Charles, reporters and photographers encouraged Rita Marley, Bob's widow, to give the rasta hats to the prince and goaded him into trying one on; the media made sure that a line-up of sexy limbo dancers was just in shot as the prince left a culture performance staged in his honour. So is it really fair to set him up, only to use the stunt as an excuse to knock him down later? The royal reporters travelling with the prince's party believe so; after all, the prince doesn't have to put on the hats, he has no obligation to talk to the parrots, and he didn't need to play the pan drums in such a ridiculous fashion. \"He's been doing this job for 30 years; he should know by now,\" says one experienced hack. It is indeed obvious that Charles must have a shrewd understanding of how the media works - after all, he's managed to completely revamp his image since his ex-wife's death - and he knows that without a picture, the stories of his tour would never make the papers at all, let alone the front pages. He is probably betting that such stunts will not only go down well with the locals, but will also, on some level, boost his reputation as a lovable and kind man back home. He is certainly making a big effort with the press. During his royal tours, for instance, he has made himself far more accessible than ever before. St James's Palace makes all the travel arrangements; journalists travel in the prince's private jet, the royal rat pack separated from the future monarch only by a thin partition. At the start of the tour and again at the end, the prince strolls to the back of the plane to chat to the press. It is a routine so familiar now that reporters don't rush to the phone later to file the exclusive. On location, hacks and the royal household share drinks by the pool. \"A few years ago, we'd be climbing up those palm trees outside to get pictures of this lot in here,\" one photographer says. Now, the prince realises that he needs the media to get his message across, and accepts that he is going to take a few knocks along the way.

In that time, British audiences have discovered that circus doesn't necessarily mean sad elephants and corny clowns.

Companies such as Circus Ronaldo and Cirque Ici regularly perform at big international theatre festivals. Aerialists and tumblers are at the centre of the government-approved Dome.

That's why Circus Oz's irreverent, act-based style is a breath of fresh air. The punky, tattooed performers may look as if they've been let loose from another zany planet, but their attempts to negotiate flaming high wires, dive through hoops and parachute using dirty washing are recognisably human. Failure is as much part of an Oz performance as success.</p> <p>Mike Finch, the company's artistic director since 1998, believes that in the 22 years of its existence, Circus Oz has come full circle. The great innovator of new or contemporary circus is now finding that it has more in common with traditional circus than it would ever have thought possible.</p> <p>\"What we do is very much real circus. It's not what you see some new companies doing, which is a ballet about circus. Aesthetically we may not have much in common with traditional circus, but we do in terms of craft. It's like setting out to make a piece of art out of wood. It is different from making a piece of furniture, but you may find that you can learn a lot from the old-style cabinet maker.\"</p> <p>Which raises the question: what is so new about new circus? Finch believes that it is all in the eye. \"What contemporary circus did was to take the act and say, 'What if we cross-dressed it or did it in slow motion?' Almost all those things have been done now and what we have discovered is that a chair is still a chair, however you upholster it. The real challenge for a circus director is in understanding the frame.\"</p> <p>It's also in walking the tightrope between creating a piece of work that is both artistically interesting and physically sustainable. \"Acrobats are not empty vessels like actors. They arrive with the script in their bodies,\" says Finch. \"They see things in a very different way to a director. A split second idea means two months of training for them to perfect the craft. Creating a circus act is the opposite of other creative acts. You go into a room, lock the door and just repeat it and repeat it until you get it right.\"</p> <p>Oz proves that you can turn the craft into an art if it is contextualised and politicised. The company came out of the radical movements of the 60s and 70s and in its early days was famed for its in-your-face politics. If the performances are tamer now, they are still grounded in the idea that to build a human pyramid you need all sorts of people and that a small group working to achieve the impossible is a political statement in itself. This is reflected in the company's largely non-hierarchical structure: administrators, technicians, performers and musicians are afforded the same status and people change roles according to their personal circumstances. Finch himself began at Circus Oz in 1992 on work experience.</p> <p>In our culture, circus is more than an act of skill: it is a fantasy. Part of the appeal of Circus Oz is that it represents a whole mythology. In setting up the circus, the original founders - mostly middle class, university-educated people working in theatre - did what so many of us dream of but are too scared to do. Finch is keen to play down the romance angle but points out that if you spend six months hanging from someone else's hands or trusting your life to the person doing your rigging, family-like relationships do develop.</p> <p>On stage, this is reflected in a performance that works like a piece of brilliantly orchestrated chaos and which is made memorable by the sense that what you are witnessing is a simultaneous celebration of the ensemble and the individual.</p> <p>Stylistically, the show has much in common with the aggressive energy of stand-up comedy. Its genius is in the framing: each act has an individual flavour that both subverts and salutes traditional circus acts and mirrors our own ordinary lives. Those who try to juggle their busy schedules will see themselves reflected in an act which begins with a man taking a shower and develops as he tries to juggle and get dressed at the same time. The high wire performance turns into a statement about sexual politics and the changing relationships of men and women as two leather-clad, whip wielding women force a man wearing a skirt to walk the wire.</p> <p>Throughout the evening the performers look surprised by their own prowess and are endearingly unfazed when things go wrong. \"What I love about Circus Oz,\" says Finch, \"is that we never play pretend with the audience. It is real. The juggler has the balls and the walker is on the wire and the audience may go 'wow', but they're compelled to believe it because they've seen it with their own eyes. They don't have to suspend disbelief. And they also know that if the performers fall, they will get hurt.\"</p>",

More along the lines of Dream Girls or The Rocky Horror Picture Show.\" Or as Verdi might have put it, had he lived to receive the nausea-inducing news that the creative zenith of his career was going to be turned into a ballad-ridden musical by Elton John complete with techno-pop orchestration: \"It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside...\"",

Yet his office in the Louvre is modest and donnish, with art books arrayed on a big table and assistants chatting next door.</p> <p>A member of the Academie Fran\u00e7aise, pr\u00e9sident-directeur of the Museum du Louvre, and curator of the Chardin exhibition that opens at London's Royal Academy next week, Rosenberg is the world's foremost authority on this strange and seductive 18th-century French artist. Jean-Sim\u00e9on Chardin, born in Paris in 1699, and the most idiosyncratic and modern artist of the 18th century, painted nothing but domestic scenes and still lifes. Pierre Rosenberg published his first book on the artist for the legendary modern art publisher Skira in 1963; he mounted a previous definitive retrospective of the artist in 1979. Returning to Chardin now, he says, is \"a great rest, a great pleasure\".</p> <p>It's also, perhaps, his duty as guardian of the French national patrimony. There's something \"very French\" about Chardin and it goes to the heart of the national culture and its exportability. The 18th-century critic and philosopher Diderot enthused about Chardin's still lifes as if directing readers to re-create them at home - \"suspend a river bird by one leg. On the dresser below imagine some biscuits...\" and today you can get that Chardin feeling by shopping for French produce at your local supermarket. On a table arrange some pat\u00e9 and a glass of red wine and you've got that particular French aesthetic of the everyday that appears for the first time in Chardin's paintings and made him a cult figure for modern French artists and writers. The sense that food and wine are themselves culture still pervades French art and life. It's what everyone who eats a slice of Brie is buying into.</p> <p>The titles of Chardin's paintings convey this perfectly. Preparations for Lunch. A Lady Taking Tea. Or - in a rare moment of violence - A Soup Tureen with a Cat Stalking a Partridge and Hare. Across the river at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, you can see this desire to pay attention to the little things running right through French modern art. The museum is full of paintings that directly quote Chardin. Take some apples, put them on a table, and Chardin's recipe gives you C\u00e9zanne. All the great French artists in the second half of the 19th century, points out Rosenberg, adored Chardin. \"Manet, Van Gogh, C\u00e9zanne - all of them\".</p> <p>They were painting the same world, the world of middle-class pleasures - a world that French culture has dramatised and beautified better than any other. The girls walking through a Monet field are descendants of the lady taking tea in a Chardin genre painting or one of Chardin's scullery maids.</p> <p>We come back to what Rosenberg says about Chardin being \"the reverse of an artist you can speak of\". What he means is that there is no history visible in Chardin's pictures. They depict a world absolutely cut off from great public events - a world where nothing seems to happen. \"When you speak of David you have French history, Napoleon, heroes - there's nothing of this sort with Chardin. So it's very difficult for art critics to speak of Chardin.\"</p> <p>This turning away from the big narrative of history is not a coincidence, he says, it's what made Chardin subversive, even revolutionary in his own century. In the 18th century, history painting was the top genre and every other kind of art was inferior. Still life was tosh. \"What was most respected in an artist was the fact of being able to invent. To have imagination; to be able to transform the Bible or Tacitus into an image.\" The closer art got to real life, the less elevated it was because it was regarded as mere craft, mere skill: only the painter who imagined events in history or myth was a true artist.</p> <p>Chardin wasn't up to it. Really, says Rosenberg, he couldn't do it. The son of a master cabinet maker, he never had the academic training to be a history painter - he never learned how to animate bodies, how to construct a crowd scene. His still lifes and scenes of everyday life were painted in the opposite way from history painting - by looking. And, argues, Rosenberg, Chardin turned his weakness into a strength.</p> <p>Rosenberg believes that Chardin is not as silent as he seems. That his painting embodies a philosophy. Eighteenth-century France is where modern exhibitions and art critics began. Every two years a huge public exhibition, the Salon, was held at the Louvre and passionately reviewed. The most famous reviewer was the Enlightenment philosopher Diderot and he adored Chardin.</p> <p>\"For Diderot, meeting Chardin was a coup de foudre\" says Rosenberg. \"In a certain way, the idea that Diderot had about art is very much the idea of Chardin. Chardin was a man who had thought a lot about what art could do but had not been trained; and he uses Diderot to express his ideas.\"</p> <p>This is a very controversial idea; Diderot is regarded the father of modern art criticism. Now Rosenberg is saying he got it all from the supposedly inarticulate and ignorant Chardin. The painter whom contemporaries sneered at as barely literate - he may not have been able to write - was in fact a great philosopher of art. Daring, but it's based on Rosenberg's intimacy with Chardin. These paintings are philosophies: they are ideas. It's thought you can't resist when looking at the calm and clarity with which Chardin puts a glass of water. And that very modern, clear-eyed way of looking at things is what Rosenberg says this art is all about, That's what Diderot says it is about - the \"magic\" of seeing the world clearly. Paying attention. Seeing what is there.</p> <p>\"Chardin is painting what he sees. He's really painting only what he sees, I think - a child playing or flowers or what you like. By copying what you see you are able to give objects a beauty, a nobility. In a way this is the great idea of Proust when he writes about Chardin in 1895... it is, I think, in a certain way what both Chardin and Diderot thought.\"</p> <p>Paris is currently full of Proust books, riding on the back of Raul Ruiz's film Time Regained - you can even buy a Proust cookery book. If you look hard enough you can find Proust's essay on Chardin which Rosenberg says is \"fundamental\" to understanding the artist. In the article Proust takes a jaded young aesthete to the Louvre and shows him Chardin's still life paintings. Because Chardin found a glass of water or a cup of tea \"beautiful to paint\", says Proust, he teaches us to find the things themselves \"beautiful to behold\". Looking at his art, \"we see the beauty of the these objects through the eyes of Chardin,\" as Rosenberg puts it</p> <p>On the way out I brush against a little green glass object on his desk - don't worry, he says, it's not valuable. Just something with a personal meaning. One of the half-forgotten things we live with, that we scarcely notice, that mean everything. What he would like, says Rosenberg, is for people to look at the paintings in the Chardin exhibition for a long time and give them the attention they need.</p> <p>Chardin is at the Royal Academy of Arts, London W1, from March 11-May 29.

And why, if you do get through to report dud goods, the onus is on you to return them. \"We do ask customers to post the goods back to us if they are unable to return them themselves,\" says a spokeswoman, helpfully - a weighty operation if, like reader Jonathan Ben-Ami, it's a 2m-high wardrobe.</p> <p>Then there are the cases of Jonathan Lorie, James Sloan and Ben Timmis, all of London. They each recently ordered Ikea kitchens. Lorie eventually acquired his after two missed delivery appointments, only to find that three items were missing.</p> <p>Seven weeks and many promises later, he was still waiting. Sloan's delivery also lacked crucial components, and included an incorrect work surface and an extra cupboard which he was told to send back himself. Eleven calls to the helpline got him nowhere and, after three months with an unusable kitchen, he spent several more calls persuading Ikea to take back the whole thing. Timmis' experience was almost identical.</p> <p>Ikea has promised that its customer services are expanding, but that this will \"take some time\". Equally stretched is its delivery firm Hays, which regularly misses appointments - five times in the case of Jillian Le Jeune of New Malden. Ikea last year confessed to a \"logistical problem\" and was obliged to extend waiting times by two weeks to cope with demand.</p> <p>\"We are aware of the occasional difficulties and frustrations that some of our customers encounter,\" says Matti Naar, UK marketing director. \"Ikea is a high-volume operation, that's how we keep our prices so low. But the tremendous demand is one of the main causes of the problems.\" Such problems could, he believes, be solved if the company could double its 10 UK stores, but \"the current presumption against edge-of-town development makes it difficult for us to find new sites\".</p> <p>The difficulty for consumers is that Ikea doesn't need to worry about their grievances. Why should it when demand is so large that those with internet access are advised to check a live photo of their local Ikea carpark before risking what could turn out to be a two-hour queue (a service of limited use since Ikea doesn't always update its pictures).</p> <p>Ikea's UK profit amounted to \u00a3522m last year, and 130m people visited 150 branches in 28 countries. Ikea likes to claim that it is steered not by figures but by \"vision\", including an environmental empathy which is belied by the huge blue and yellow hangars on open ground and traffic jams for a mile around.</p> <p>Unlike most retail businesses, it declines to adapt to local markets, preferring to evangelise Swedishness and what it calls \"democratic design\" - a problem for Ben Timmis, whose kitchen units were not designed to accommodate the English system of exposed piping.

Competition in the UK, where Ikea has 4% of the furniture market, is so poor that it can undercut it without sacrifice, but the company insists the reason is the government's stern view of out-of-town retail centres which prevents them expanding (an unconvincing moan given 25m shoppers visited its UK stores last year).</p> <p>Yet when it's good, it's very good.

      "body": "<p>Procter &amp; Gamble - the American conglomerate whose brands range from Sunny Delight to Fairy Liquid - and the government have topped a new league table of Britain's biggest advertisers. </p> <p>The US consumer goods empire and the central office of information spent more than quarter of a billion pounds between them on television and newspaper advertising, billboards and cinema last year. </p> <p>P&amp;G, which has its British base on Tyneside, is by far the country's biggest advertiser. It spent \u00a3165m promoting 160 brands last year - \u00a370m more than its nearest rival. </p> <p>The group's biggest outlay was \u00a38.3m to encourage consumers to switch from squash to Sunny Delight, the orange drink which became the most successful grocery product launch of the 1990s. </p> <p>Some \u00a37m was earmarked to launch of the group's Secret deodorant last year. Other big P&amp;G brands that command multi-million pound campaigns include Pantene, Fairy Liquid, Ariel and Always. </p> <p>The league table, compiled by AC Nielsen MMS and Marketing magazine, shows that the government is now pouring \u00a31.7m a week into advertising - more than 50% more than in 1998. </p> <p>The Action 2000 millennium bug campaign cost \u00a39m, and promotions for the army and Action for Jobs and the inland revenue's Hector the Inspector campaign also soaked up millions of pounds. </p> <p>The COI was the largest press advertiser in 1999, buying \u00a326m of space. Electrical retailer Currys was the second biggest newspaper advertiser with a \u00a325m spend. </p> <p>The government is also the biggest radio and cinema advertiser, while the tobacco industry dominates billboards, spending \u00a329m a year on roadside campaigns. </p> <p>Television company ONdigital recorded the biggest leap in advertising expenditure. Its near \u00a334m outlay, including the television commercials featuring Chris Tarrant, was a 458% increase on 1998. </p> <p>Although the huge leap was a result of the company only having launched in 1998, it is now spending almost the same as its larger rival, BSkyB. </p> <p>Marks &amp; Spencer pulled out all the stops and spent more than \u00a321m on advertising in an attempt to halt its sliding sales. Until last year the retailer had spurned traditional advertising but as its profits plunged, it sanctioned a 254% increase in its advertising spend. </p> <p>Elsewhere, the banking group HSBC increased its outlay by 307% to \u00a321m as it set about rebranding Midland Bank with a high-profile television advertising campaign. </p> <p>But it was still outspent by NatWest - which laid out nearly \u00a328m to reinforce its brand strength just before it succumbed to the takeover bid from Royal Bank of Scotland.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Procter &amp; Gamble - the American conglomerate whose brands range from Sunny Delight to Fairy Liquid - and the government have topped a new league table of Britain's biggest advertisers. The US consumer goods empire and the central office of information spent more than quarter of a billion pounds between them on television and newspaper advertising, billboards and cinema last year. P&amp;G, which has its British base on Tyneside, is by far the country's biggest advertiser. It spent \u00a3165m promoting 160 brands last year - \u00a370m more than its nearest rival. The group's biggest outlay was \u00a38.3m to encourage consumers to switch from squash to Sunny Delight, the orange drink which became the most successful grocery product launch of the 1990s. Some \u00a37m was earmarked to launch of the group's Secret deodorant last year. Other big P&amp;G brands that command multi-million pound campaigns include Pantene, Fairy Liquid, Ariel and Always. The league table, compiled by AC Nielsen MMS and Marketing magazine, shows that the government is now pouring \u00a31.7m a week into advertising - more than 50% more than in 1998. The Action 2000 millennium bug campaign cost \u00a39m, and promotions for the army and Action for Jobs and the inland revenue's Hector the Inspector campaign also soaked up millions of pounds. The COI was the largest press advertiser in 1999, buying \u00a326m of space. Electrical retailer Currys was the second biggest newspaper advertiser with a \u00a325m spend. The government is also the biggest radio and cinema advertiser, while the tobacco industry dominates billboards, spending \u00a329m a year on roadside campaigns. Television company ONdigital recorded the biggest leap in advertising expenditure. Its near \u00a334m outlay, including the television commercials featuring Chris Tarrant, was a 458% increase on 1998. Although the huge leap was a result of the company only having launched in 1998, it is now spending almost the same as its larger rival, BSkyB. Marks &amp; Spencer pulled out all the stops and spent more than \u00a321m on advertising in an attempt to halt its sliding sales. Until last year the retailer had spurned traditional advertising but as its profits plunged, it sanctioned a 254% increase in its advertising spend. Elsewhere, the banking group HSBC increased its outlay by 307% to \u00a321m as it set about rebranding Midland Bank with a high-profile television advertising campaign. But it was still outspent by NatWest - which laid out nearly \u00a328m to reinforce its brand strength just before it succumbed to the takeover bid from Royal Bank of Scotland.",

But as one of Britain's largest gay enterprises, embracing not only the Flamingo but five other bars and clubs, it is anything but small time, small town. </p> <p>Newby, a former Pontin bluecoat, would-be French teacher and one-time fancy goods shop owner, is now poised for his biggest deal so far - conversion of the big Odeon cinema across the road from his office into an entertainment and shopping complex, complete with specialist health centre, for the gay community. He wants to make it into the world's biggest gay disco. </p> <p>A small, fast-talking, amusing man with an easy west Lancashire lilt, he refuses to discuss his forty-something age or his millionaire cult status in the old resort. \"Child entrepreneur, born in the 1960s,\" he laughs. </p> <p>\"I don't just sit down and think I'm a guy worth all this money, isn't it wonderful,\" he smiles. \"Things have just happened, that's all. I've got a nice house [in a nearby village], nice car [a BMW 8 series]; that's it.\" </p> <p>Newby's parents ran a theatrical boarding house across the road from Blackpool's Imperial Hotel. There he met Norman \"over the garden wall\" Evans, Hylda Baker, Max Bygraves, and many more. He also developed a taste for showbiz. After boarding school in Wales, he went to a teacher training college in Blackpool - but left after two years to start a fancy goods shop, which he named Gone Gay. \"We sold rings at 99p each and a vast range of naughty toys.\" </p> <p>After a year or so he sold out, banked the \u00a315,000 plus from the sale, and joined Pontins in Devon as a bluecoat \"to chill out\". </p> <p>Two years later he returned to Blackpool and bought the Flamingo with his savings and a bank loan. It then had a capacity of 200. Soon he decided to turn it into a gay club. Twenty years later, and \"several million pounds on\", it has a 2,000 capacity and opens seven days a week. \"It's one of the largest gay clubs in Europe,\" he says proudly. \"We use our own design team to continually refurbish it. You can't stand still in this business.\" </p> <p>Then he bought a succession of other premises - Pepys Bar, Basil's on the Strand, the Flying Handbag and then Funny Girls - with the full co-operation of the local council and the licensing magistrates. </p> <p>They balked at only one of his suggestions. He wanted to turn a pub named the Kings Arms into the Whippet Inn. \"They said, 'we don't think so, if you don't mind', so I said how would you take to the Flying Handbag and they had a bit of a laugh and said yes. </p> <p>\"They've been great. No problems. Don't forget, I was the first gay person to have a club licence in the town.\" </p> <p>Success soon bred success. The big brewers, once so hostile to his enterprise, were desperate to come on board once they saw the value of the pink pound in Blackpool. </p> <p>But when he started 20 years ago, things were very different. \"No brewers wanted to be involved and only Vaux [the late Sunderland brewer] would lend us any money,\" he recalls. </p> <p>\"I remember going to one of the biggest brewers, and when I said I wanted help and it was a gay club they turned away and faced the wall. Wouldn't look at me. A few years later they things had changed. They were desperate to come in.\" </p> <p>Newby's big breakthrough came six years ago when he opened Funny Girls in Blackpool's Queen Street. He wanted an all-singing and dancing cabaret joint -camp, over the top, yet suitable for all the community. </p> <p>While the bar staff are all in drag, the shows sometimes outrageous, he reckons that only 10% of the clientele is gay. \"We get a good mix, all types - celebs from Coronation Street and the soaps. It's very safe and secure.\" </p> <p>He has already been approached by the First Leisure group to franchise the Funny Girls brand in a converted London theatre. \"Michael Grade put the idea to me. I was a bit nervous at the time - could we keep up the standard we have in Blackpool?\" So he did not proceed. </p> <p>He thinks, however, that the franchising idea has great potential. \"But I wouldn't open anywhere outside Blackpool. You either love it or hate it, and I love it. It's like Las Vegas on heat.\" </p> <p>Newby's next big idea is to take over the old Odeon cinema, once licensed for up to 3,500 people. </p> <p>It comes within a redevelopment area, and he has already signed a contract with developers. \"If if goes pear-shaped they'll have to buy it back from us, but I don't think that will happen. </p> <p>\"I want to make it a gay complex with a small and a large disco, a gay shopping mall and a gay health centre. We'll even incorporate a Whippet Inn this time.\" </p> <p>He sees great potential for turning Blackpool into the Las Vegas of Europe. \"It has to move away from being a family resort - those days are gone. </p> <p>\"Families can go abroad so cheaply now and get guaranteed sun, so you have to move on. So my idea would be to develop more casinos, have more neon lights, more excitement - a hit-you-in-the face kind of place.\" </p> <p>The boss of ITP also knows that his enterprise is central to Blackpool's economy, with Funny Girls now as well known as the tower and the golden mile. \"The good thing is that people come to our venues throughout the entire year, stay in [50-plus] gay hotels, use taxis and local shops and theatres, go on the piers. They're not just helping me, but helping to keep a lot of other businesses going as well.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Shares in SBC Communications and BellSouth rose sharply yesterday on the back of reports that the companies were to merge their mobile phone operations. The new network could have more than 16m customers across America competing against the operation planned by Britain's Vodafone and Atlanta-based Bell Atlantic. Telecoms companies are racing to provide national wireless coverage for the growing number of customers unhappy about the cost and difficulty involved in using their phones outside their local area. Neither SBC, the largest US phone company, nor BellSouth would report yesterday on their talks, which are believed to have been off and on for the past two years. The Wall Street Journal reported that the recent talks were \"fluid and could break down\". However, the report was enough to send shares in west coast-based SBC up more than 8% at midday and those in BellSouth up more than 5%. Both had been trading at or near 52-week lows before yesterday's reports as investors worried about increased competition and their lack of national coverage. Investors are increasingly keen to buy telecommunications companies with a worldwide reach. Vodafone's relationship with Bell Atlantic and acquisition of AirTouch in the US was cited as one factor for its successful attempt to win investor support for its Mannesmann bid. The Vodafone/Bell Atlantic operation is expected to have more than 20m customers. Vodafone Airtouch closed down 3p at 352 yesterday.",

The company is investing $67m (\u00a342m) in CAT, in return for help developing medicines that target these genes. </p> <p>CAT's shares rocketed by \u00a313.62 to \u00a337.25 on the news, valuing it at \u00a31.02bn. The price has surged seven-fold in two months, in the stock market's rush for hi-tech biotechnology. </p> <p>CAT's chief executive David Chiswell said: \"We've been on a good roll for a while. We're getting together a run of deals so people can see we really do have the possibility of getting lots of drugs into the clinic and into trials.\" </p> <p>The company has a unique method of isolating human antibodies - weapons naturally produced by the body to fight illness - and wants to match these with genes that Human Genome Sciences has linked to the cause of diseases. </p> <p>Mr Chiswell said: \"They were one of the first to drive the commercialisation of gene sequencing. They have all the information on where genes are found.\" </p> <p>Human Genome Sciences has a controversial policy of securing patents over genes. It recently won exclusive rights to research a gene considered the \"docking point\" for the Aids virus. Under the terms of the agreement, CAT will choose 24 targets to attack from the company's biological \"library\". It will develop six products alone, in return for milestone payments and royalties to Human Genome Sciences. The two companies will share costs and profits equally on the other 18. </p> <p>Analysts said the most likely areas of research would be blood diseases such as leukaemia. Human Genome Sciences is paying an immediate $12m to CAT in cash, and will invest $55m in a 6% stake of the company. </p> <p>Analysts welcomed the deal but stressed that it was a long-term project. John Savin of Greig Middleton said: \"It's quite difficult to see them making money for many years.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Diagnostics company Axis-Shield has signed a deal under which German group Bayer will develop its technology for predicting heart attacks.

      "bodyText": "Drug development company Cambridge Antibody Technology yesterday announced an alliance with one of the world's biggest genomics companies, sending its market value soaring to more than \u00a31bn. The firm is to share technology with US-based Human Genome Sciences, which has a library of more than 12,000 genes. The company is investing $67m (\u00a342m) in CAT, in return for help developing medicines that target these genes. CAT's shares rocketed by \u00a313.62 to \u00a337.25 on the news, valuing it at \u00a31.02bn. The price has surged seven-fold in two months, in the stock market's rush for hi-tech biotechnology. CAT's chief executive David Chiswell said: \"We've been on a good roll for a while. We're getting together a run of deals so people can see we really do have the possibility of getting lots of drugs into the clinic and into trials.\" The company has a unique method of isolating human antibodies - weapons naturally produced by the body to fight illness - and wants to match these with genes that Human Genome Sciences has linked to the cause of diseases. Mr Chiswell said: \"They were one of the first to drive the commercialisation of gene sequencing. They have all the information on where genes are found.\" Human Genome Sciences has a controversial policy of securing patents over genes. It recently won exclusive rights to research a gene considered the \"docking point\" for the Aids virus. Under the terms of the agreement, CAT will choose 24 targets to attack from the company's biological \"library\". It will develop six products alone, in return for milestone payments and royalties to Human Genome Sciences. The two companies will share costs and profits equally on the other 18. Analysts said the most likely areas of research would be blood diseases such as leukaemia. Human Genome Sciences is paying an immediate $12m to CAT in cash, and will invest $55m in a 6% stake of the company. Analysts welcomed the deal but stressed that it was a long-term project. John Savin of Greig Middleton said: \"It's quite difficult to see them making money for many years.\" \u0095 Diagnostics company Axis-Shield has signed a deal under which German group Bayer will develop its technology for predicting heart attacks. Its shares jumped 162.5p to \u00a311.",

      "body": "<p>Dozens of top companies will be named and shamed this month for failing to take environmental issues seriously. </p> <p>The environment minister, Michael Meacher, said yesterday that many leading businesses are using \"voluntarism\" as an excuse for doing nothing. </p> <p>He warned that he would name the laggards and that the government would resort to legislation if companies continued to ignore demands to improve. He suggested that the fundamental review of company law could recom mend mandatory environmental reporting - a move Mr Meacher said he would welcome. </p> <p>\"The days of secrecy are over,\" he said. \"There are still many slackers out there. I have my eye on you and will name you publicly in the near future if you don't make an effort.\" </p> <p>Mr Meacher is expected to use the latest research on environmental reporting - due out later this month at a conference organised by the pensions industry research group Pirc - to expose top companies that have failed to respond to years of govern ment pressure.

      "bodyText": "Dozens of top companies will be named and shamed this month for failing to take environmental issues seriously. The environment minister, Michael Meacher, said yesterday that many leading businesses are using \"voluntarism\" as an excuse for doing nothing. He warned that he would name the laggards and that the government would resort to legislation if companies continued to ignore demands to improve. He suggested that the fundamental review of company law could recom mend mandatory environmental reporting - a move Mr Meacher said he would welcome. \"The days of secrecy are over,\" he said. \"There are still many slackers out there. I have my eye on you and will name you publicly in the near future if you don't make an effort.\" Mr Meacher is expected to use the latest research on environmental reporting - due out later this month at a conference organised by the pensions industry research group Pirc - to expose top companies that have failed to respond to years of govern ment pressure. About 30% of the top 350 companies still make no reference to environmental issues in their annual reports. In the ninth year of these awards, organised by the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, only 65 British firms produced a separate environmental report. This included only 39 FTSE 100 companies. Yesterday Mr Meacher announced that the government's advisory committee on business and the environment, ACBE, would lay down what companies should report, so there would be no excuse for failing to address green performance.

Like her heroine Aretha Franklin, there is grit, warmth and self-determination in her voice. Propelled by a rootsy bass and vibrant backing vocals, her strongest songs are about the dilemmas of creativity and success, like Concrete Jungle, an angry look at the music industry, \"saturated with imitations of what's hip\".

A former backing singer with acts such as Incognito and Fierce, she's at home on the stage, tackling each number with a singleminded focus. She briefly calms proceedings with an acoustic rendition of the Aretha classic Until You Come Back to Me, before returning to the fray with upbeat gospel-style harmonies. Here the energy momentarily dissipates amid more straightforward numbers, including the radio-friendly but \"normal\" For Your Love. By the time they return for the encore, though, Mwelwa and the band are firing again. They've just found out about the Blues &amp; Soul award. \"Won't let nobody cloud my judgement/Or infiltrate my dreams,\" croons Mwelwa. You tell em, sista. </p>",

      "body": "<p>It's little wonder that Django Bates's arrangement of New York, New York lurched, in the composer's words, from \"distinction to extinction\" at its first performance during a conference for the grandees of Polygram in New York. The piece is a riotous collection of dissonant harmonisations, impenetrably dense textures, and snatches of the US national anthem, which surface, flail about, and then drown in Bates's all-consuming sonic maelstrom. Bates contributed his own vocals at the Britten Sinfonia's concert, enthroned behind racks of keyboards and samplers in the midst of the orchestra. </p> <p>The post-Charles Ives clutter of Bates's arrangement was no accident in the Britten Sinfonia's concert. Their programme revealed connections and creative contrasts between Bates, Bach, Ligeti, and Ives himself. A selection of Ives's shorter works ranged from the anarchical rhythmic profusion of the Country Band March and Ragtime Dance No 4, to the transcendent hush of his Hymn. </p> <p>All of these Ivesian qualities found parallels in the evening's world premiere, Bates's concerto for synthesiser, embedded jazz quartet, and orchestra, 2000 Years Beyond Undo. In outline, it was possible to discern the dim vestiges of a conventional concerto layout: an opening allegro; a set of slow-ish variations, even if they were unconventionally brash; and a grandiose final movement, preceded by the archaic quaintness of a showy cadenza. However, the divisions between these sections seemed as arbitrary as the colours of the accompanying lighting. </p> <p>But it was Bates's wit and worldliness which were the work's most original features. Announcing to the audience during the Theremin-like swoops of the cadenza, that \"one always ends a piano cadenza with a trill\", his synthesiser duly obliged and became a genteel concert grand. The mock finale that followed took the musical irreverence to another level in its pilfering of Beethoven's Ode to Joy. </p> <p>However, Bates's sonorous m\u00e9lange is not just an attempt to debunk or deconstruct. As demonstrated by his Three English Scenes, there is a warmth and affection behind his energetic eccentricity. Emphasising Bates's regard for the conventional classical world, Joanna MacGregor joined the Britten Sinfonia in two piano concertos: Ligeti's found echoes in the surrounding sound and fury, and the pristine coolness of Bach's counterpoint created an unlikely ally for Bates's souped-up polyphony. </p> <p> At Basingstoke Anvil tonight, then tours.

      "bodyText": "It's little wonder that Django Bates's arrangement of New York, New York lurched, in the composer's words, from \"distinction to extinction\" at its first performance during a conference for the grandees of Polygram in New York. The piece is a riotous collection of dissonant harmonisations, impenetrably dense textures, and snatches of the US national anthem, which surface, flail about, and then drown in Bates's all-consuming sonic maelstrom. Bates contributed his own vocals at the Britten Sinfonia's concert, enthroned behind racks of keyboards and samplers in the midst of the orchestra. The post-Charles Ives clutter of Bates's arrangement was no accident in the Britten Sinfonia's concert. Their programme revealed connections and creative contrasts between Bates, Bach, Ligeti, and Ives himself. A selection of Ives's shorter works ranged from the anarchical rhythmic profusion of the Country Band March and Ragtime Dance No 4, to the transcendent hush of his Hymn. All of these Ivesian qualities found parallels in the evening's world premiere, Bates's concerto for synthesiser, embedded jazz quartet, and orchestra, 2000 Years Beyond Undo. In outline, it was possible to discern the dim vestiges of a conventional concerto layout: an opening allegro; a set of slow-ish variations, even if they were unconventionally brash; and a grandiose final movement, preceded by the archaic quaintness of a showy cadenza. However, the divisions between these sections seemed as arbitrary as the colours of the accompanying lighting. But it was Bates's wit and worldliness which were the work's most original features. Announcing to the audience during the Theremin-like swoops of the cadenza, that \"one always ends a piano cadenza with a trill\", his synthesiser duly obliged and became a genteel concert grand. The mock finale that followed took the musical irreverence to another level in its pilfering of Beethoven's Ode to Joy. However, Bates's sonorous m\u00e9lange is not just an attempt to debunk or deconstruct. As demonstrated by his Three English Scenes, there is a warmth and affection behind his energetic eccentricity. Emphasising Bates's regard for the conventional classical world, Joanna MacGregor joined the Britten Sinfonia in two piano concertos: Ligeti's found echoes in the surrounding sound and fury, and the pristine coolness of Bach's counterpoint created an unlikely ally for Bates's souped-up polyphony. At Basingstoke Anvil tonight, then tours. Details: 01223 300795.",
