He will, of course, be untwinged for United's next game, at Anfield. As for Ryan Giggs playing for Wales, \"You must be joking,\" spluttered Ferguson. Brooklyn could have done all Rachubka did and would have enabled Daddy to play and be top first-time father. United and England need his first-time vision and fine-tuned passing.",

Yes, as their pursuit of a Champions League berth enters a crucial phase, this was a most disappointing result for the Merseysiders, but G\u00e9rard Houllier's team have travelled so far in such a relatively short time that it is inevitable they will occasionally stumble when expected to stroll. In truth, Liverpool were so wretched before the interval that it was a little surprising they eventually emerged with anything tangible. In the end, though, they could - probably should - have won by a country mile, Michael Owen rescuing a point in front of the watching England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson but then missing chances he would normally be expected to accept. With Ipswich, Sunderland and Leeds all having registered victories away from home the previous afternoon, Houllier was not best pleased. \"My side showed me two different faces today,\" he said. \"In the first half we were just not at the office. We improved greatly after the break and we could well have won the game. We showed pride and we showed determination. \"It is disappointing not to collect all three points but we are still up there; we have games in hand on those around us,\" he added. Those who find little merit in squad rotation were sporting smug smiles during the first half of what was a curiously over-polite game, which at times appeared to have been stripped of its competitive edge. Mindful that his team had succumbed to battle fatigue almost exactly 12 months earlier, Houllier omitted four of the men who had been instrumental in the Uefa Cup defeat of Porto. He brought on one of them, Steven Gerrard, after 55 minutes with Houllier admitting: \"Steven has had some niggling injuries, he was not entirely fit, and he was only put on in an emergency situation.

But, for once, there was to be only limited payback. For all the effort of Owen, for all Jari Litmanen's sweet interventions, there was nothing to excite and very little to covet in the first half. Having arrived in the north-west intent on ring-fencing the single point they held at kick-off, Derby could hardly believe their good fortune. Not that Jim Smith's side lacked discipline or adventure; they simply produced smart football and then gratefully accepted the gifts their generous hosts laid before them. Initially, Liverpool enjoyed almost all the possession and never looked like scoring while Derby gorged themselves upon crumbs and were in front after only nine minutes. In keeping with the afternoon, it was an unconvincing goal, Deon Burton hooking home the scruffiest of shots after Horacio Carbonari touched on Seth Johnson's corner. Until the substitute Thordur Gudjonsson saw his low drive halted by goalkeeper Sander Westerveld with just six minutes remaining, that was to be Derby's only effort on target. Liverpool were altogether more dangerous in the second period and after Owen steered home at the second attempt after a neat exchange with Litmanen, they seemed likely to win. Three times Owen found himself beautifully placed inside the Derby penalty area, three times he steered his shot across the face of goal and wide of the far post. He probably will not do that again between now and the end of next season but he did it yesterday and, sadly for Houllier, it was to cost his side two points.",

Even so George Burley continues to refuse to tempt fate by agreeing that his team have a chance of winning the race. </p> <p>\"Our aim is to finish in the top six,\" he insists. \"Talk of a Champions League place is fairyland.\" It is a tone reminiscent of David O'Leary's famous underplaying of Leeds's chances early in the season. And no one believed him either. </p> <p>It is team spirit which underpins the Ipswich dream, and Saturday's victory was testament to that. Despite losing six of their previous eight games in all competitions, confidence remained high as they arrived at Upton Park. </p> <p>This was in stark contrast to West Ham. A run of one win in their previous nine league games, plus George Graham's last pitch-side act as Tottenham manager, had shot their confidence to pieces. \"Everyone was devastated when Spurs beat us in the Cup,\" admitted Harry Redknapp. \"Honestly I've never known a group of players so low. Against Ipswich our confidence was zilch.\" </p> <p>Certainly West Ham were unrecognisable from the side that romped home at Old Trafford in the fourth round.

      "bodyText": "Liverpool, Newcastle, Middlesbrough, Coventry, Charlton, Manchester City, Derby; anyone who still doubts that third-placed Ipswich Town can hold on for a Champions League place in their first season back in the Premiership should look at the relative ease of their run-in. They may well earn enough points to keep at bay a chasing pack of five clubs separated by only five points. Even so George Burley continues to refuse to tempt fate by agreeing that his team have a chance of winning the race. \"Our aim is to finish in the top six,\" he insists. \"Talk of a Champions League place is fairyland.\" It is a tone reminiscent of David O'Leary's famous underplaying of Leeds's chances early in the season. And no one believed him either. It is team spirit which underpins the Ipswich dream, and Saturday's victory was testament to that. Despite losing six of their previous eight games in all competitions, confidence remained high as they arrived at Upton Park. This was in stark contrast to West Ham. A run of one win in their previous nine league games, plus George Graham's last pitch-side act as Tottenham manager, had shot their confidence to pieces. \"Everyone was devastated when Spurs beat us in the Cup,\" admitted Harry Redknapp. \"Honestly I've never known a group of players so low. Against Ipswich our confidence was zilch.\" Certainly West Ham were unrecognisable from the side that romped home at Old Trafford in the fourth round. But this is the danger of Redknapp's approach, which relies on individual genius as much as team ethic. The side can only cope with the unbalancing affect of two free spirits such as Paolo di Canio and Joe Cole so long as the pair compensate with spells of magic. But both are badly out of sorts at the moment, young Cole to the extent that he was replaced at half-time. With Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9 also struggling - he last scored in the league in December - Redknapp suddenly finds himself looking over his shoulder at the relegation pack.

      "body": "<p>Dave Jones took a significant step in his wooing of Wolverhampton Wanderers supporters by masterminding victory in his first Black Country derby yesterday. </p> <p>Wins for Wolves over their neighbours, and vice versa, are always sweet but this was sweeter than most. It was their first in eight attempts over their oldest and bitterest rivals and also represented a high spot in another season of underachievement. </p> <p>Out of the play-off running but free from relegation worries, at least Wolves supporters have some consolation to cheer them until August, and with Joleon Lescott solid in defence and another teenager Adam Proudlock full of intelligent running up front, there is also plenty to anticipate. With a little more composure against an Albion defence that looks as stable as a henhouse in a hurricane, Proudlock could have capped a promising performance with a couple of goals.</p> <p>Instead George Ndah made his mark in an act of direct retribution given that in his previous game against Albion he sustained a broken leg and had to sit out the next year. That injury followed an old-time challenge by Matt Carbon and Jones warned Ndah not to take the law into his own hands. </p> <p>Ndah, heeding the advice, opted for a legitimate method of revenge and was rewarded with two goals and was named man of the match. </p> <p>\"He fully deserve it, and the rest of my players were not far behind,\" the Wolves manager confirmed. \"They worked tremendously hard and this represented another stage in our rebuilding.\" </p> <p>Jones's quite satisfaction came in stark contrast to the undisguised rage of his Albion counterpart, Gary Megson. \"If anybody says I'm disappointed they would be badly wrong,\" he said. \"I'm furious, and not one of my players can expect to be in the team next week. </p> <p>\"We were sadly lacking and it's a huge embarrassment to have brought 3,000 of our supporters here and performed like that.

      "bodyText": "Dave Jones took a significant step in his wooing of Wolverhampton Wanderers supporters by masterminding victory in his first Black Country derby yesterday. Wins for Wolves over their neighbours, and vice versa, are always sweet but this was sweeter than most. It was their first in eight attempts over their oldest and bitterest rivals and also represented a high spot in another season of underachievement. Out of the play-off running but free from relegation worries, at least Wolves supporters have some consolation to cheer them until August, and with Joleon Lescott solid in defence and another teenager Adam Proudlock full of intelligent running up front, there is also plenty to anticipate. With a little more composure against an Albion defence that looks as stable as a henhouse in a hurricane, Proudlock could have capped a promising performance with a couple of goals. Instead George Ndah made his mark in an act of direct retribution given that in his previous game against Albion he sustained a broken leg and had to sit out the next year. That injury followed an old-time challenge by Matt Carbon and Jones warned Ndah not to take the law into his own hands. Ndah, heeding the advice, opted for a legitimate method of revenge and was rewarded with two goals and was named man of the match. \"He fully deserve it, and the rest of my players were not far behind,\" the Wolves manager confirmed. \"They worked tremendously hard and this represented another stage in our rebuilding.\" Jones's quite satisfaction came in stark contrast to the undisguised rage of his Albion counterpart, Gary Megson. \"If anybody says I'm disappointed they would be badly wrong,\" he said. \"I'm furious, and not one of my players can expect to be in the team next week. \"We were sadly lacking and it's a huge embarrassment to have brought 3,000 of our supporters here and performed like that. There was no verve, no zest, no passion and no desire. We are sixth in the table but looked as though we were at the bottom. It could have been eight.\" It could well have been, and if Albion do reach the Premiership via the play-offs, Messrs Henry, Owen and Yorke will be licking their lips at thought of taking on such a flimsy defence. Easy pickings will be on the menu as Ndah discovered in the 23th minute. Put clear at the left edge of the penalty area by Carl Robinson's through ball, the striker went past the Albion goalkeeper Russell Hoult before guiding the ball inside the far post between the retreating Carbon and Tony Butler. Hoult did get a touch to prevent Wolves increasing their lead in the 36th minute when, diving to his right, he diverted Ludo Pollet's well-struck volley on to a post. But he was left helpless when the game was put out of reach following two set-pieces. The first came in the dying seconds of the half when, after a short corner, Andy Sinton crossed from the right for Ndah to head home. Sinton was again the provider for the third, again from a corner. This time he delivered the ball long and Pollet headed home from distance. Neil Clement volleyed home a consolation goal in the dying minutes, but it did nothing to assuage Megson's fury.",

      "body": "<p>Sven-Goran Eriksson put his cards on the table last night and to no-one's great surprise has placed an abundance of faith in red suits. In other words the teams England's Swedish coach fields for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Finland and Albania will seek inspiration mainly from the hearts and diamonds of Manchester United and Liverpool. </p> <p>Half of the 26-man squad Eriksson announced yesterday evening are from Old Trafford or Anfield and at least half-a-dozen players from the two clubs are likely to face Finland at Liverpool on Saturday. </p> <p>For his first game as England coach, the 3-0 victory over Spain in a friendly at Villa Park a month ago, Eriksson used 18 players from an original squad of 31. In reducing the party by five for England's opening two qualifiers in foreign hands he has omitted, most notably, Sunderland's Kevin Phillips, who is still an outstanding finisher but has not repeated his prolific form of last season. </p> <p>Ugo Ehiogu, the Middlesbrough centre-back who delighted his old Villa fans by scoring England's third goal against Spain, has also been left out along with Arsenal's Ray Parlour, one of those forced out of that game through injury. Gareth Southgate, now playing again for Aston Villa, has been ignored by Eriksson which bodes ill for his future international chances. </p> <p>The team against Finland is likely to reflect the side that played the first half against Spain, after which Eriksson made seven changes. In all probability, therefore, Andy Cole will once more lead the attack with Michael Owen dropping off him, while Paul Scholes will operate in central midfield with David Beckham again used in his normal club position wide on the right. </p> <p>There will, however, be two important differences. Neither Steven Gerrard nor Steve McManaman was fit for the Spain match but both will surely perform crucial roles as England seek the World Cup points to repair the damage of a poor start to their attempts to reach next year's tournament in Japan and South Korea. </p> <p>Even now Gerrard's is a fragile talent. When Liverpool beat Porto 2-0 on Thursday in the Uefa Cup the power, speed and perception of this gifted 20-year-old midfielder recalled images of Alan Mullery. But Gerrard's muscular problems continue to make him a risk for two matches in four days and it was with reluctance that his manager, Gerard Houllier, brought him after 55 minutes as Liverpool sought salvation in yesterday's Premier League game against Derby. </p> <p>\"Steven has had some niggling injuries and he was not entirely fit,\" Houllier admitted. \"If I had played him for the whole match he would probably not have been OK to join up with England.\" </p> <p>Eriksson, then, now has to decide if Gerrard will be more use at Anfield on Saturday or in Tirana on Wednesday week. In all probability he will take the first option with Nicky Butt primed to take over against Albania. </p> <p>McManaman, has recovered from the knock which forced him out of the Spain game and is in good form on the left flank for Real Madrid. With Nicky Barmby ruled out through injury McManaman is virtually certain to fill a similar role against Finland and Albania. </p> <p>Beckham will, of course, keep the captaincy but with Gerrard and Scholes earmarked for midfield Eriksson is not going to rush into experimenting with Beckham in a more central role. In any case the Swede has already made it clear that he does not believe in using players out of their normal club positions. </p> <p>Emile Heskey was an exception to this rule in the Spain game when he came on after half-time and operated on the right wing. The role, however, is not alien to the big Liverpool striker who often moves wide and impressed Kevin Keegan when he did so against Argentina at Wembley. </p> <p>One of the most encouraging aspects of Eriksson's first squad for competitive games is that the younger bloods will feel their chance of World Cup experience is not far away. The West Ham midfield trio of Joe Cole, Michael Carrick and Frank Lampard are still there along with Wes Brown, Jamie Carragher and Ashley Cole. </p> <p>Charlton's Chris Powell is no spring chicken but obviously impressed the England coach at Villa Park before he picked up a calf strain.

      "bodyText": "Sven-Goran Eriksson put his cards on the table last night and to no-one's great surprise has placed an abundance of faith in red suits. In other words the teams England's Swedish coach fields for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Finland and Albania will seek inspiration mainly from the hearts and diamonds of Manchester United and Liverpool. Half of the 26-man squad Eriksson announced yesterday evening are from Old Trafford or Anfield and at least half-a-dozen players from the two clubs are likely to face Finland at Liverpool on Saturday. For his first game as England coach, the 3-0 victory over Spain in a friendly at Villa Park a month ago, Eriksson used 18 players from an original squad of 31. In reducing the party by five for England's opening two qualifiers in foreign hands he has omitted, most notably, Sunderland's Kevin Phillips, who is still an outstanding finisher but has not repeated his prolific form of last season. Ugo Ehiogu, the Middlesbrough centre-back who delighted his old Villa fans by scoring England's third goal against Spain, has also been left out along with Arsenal's Ray Parlour, one of those forced out of that game through injury. Gareth Southgate, now playing again for Aston Villa, has been ignored by Eriksson which bodes ill for his future international chances. The team against Finland is likely to reflect the side that played the first half against Spain, after which Eriksson made seven changes. In all probability, therefore, Andy Cole will once more lead the attack with Michael Owen dropping off him, while Paul Scholes will operate in central midfield with David Beckham again used in his normal club position wide on the right. There will, however, be two important differences. Neither Steven Gerrard nor Steve McManaman was fit for the Spain match but both will surely perform crucial roles as England seek the World Cup points to repair the damage of a poor start to their attempts to reach next year's tournament in Japan and South Korea. Even now Gerrard's is a fragile talent. When Liverpool beat Porto 2-0 on Thursday in the Uefa Cup the power, speed and perception of this gifted 20-year-old midfielder recalled images of Alan Mullery. But Gerrard's muscular problems continue to make him a risk for two matches in four days and it was with reluctance that his manager, Gerard Houllier, brought him after 55 minutes as Liverpool sought salvation in yesterday's Premier League game against Derby. \"Steven has had some niggling injuries and he was not entirely fit,\" Houllier admitted. \"If I had played him for the whole match he would probably not have been OK to join up with England.\" Eriksson, then, now has to decide if Gerrard will be more use at Anfield on Saturday or in Tirana on Wednesday week. In all probability he will take the first option with Nicky Butt primed to take over against Albania. McManaman, has recovered from the knock which forced him out of the Spain game and is in good form on the left flank for Real Madrid. With Nicky Barmby ruled out through injury McManaman is virtually certain to fill a similar role against Finland and Albania. Beckham will, of course, keep the captaincy but with Gerrard and Scholes earmarked for midfield Eriksson is not going to rush into experimenting with Beckham in a more central role. In any case the Swede has already made it clear that he does not believe in using players out of their normal club positions. Emile Heskey was an exception to this rule in the Spain game when he came on after half-time and operated on the right wing. The role, however, is not alien to the big Liverpool striker who often moves wide and impressed Kevin Keegan when he did so against Argentina at Wembley. One of the most encouraging aspects of Eriksson's first squad for competitive games is that the younger bloods will feel their chance of World Cup experience is not far away. The West Ham midfield trio of Joe Cole, Michael Carrick and Frank Lampard are still there along with Wes Brown, Jamie Carragher and Ashley Cole. Charlton's Chris Powell is no spring chicken but obviously impressed the England coach at Villa Park before he picked up a calf strain. With the inexperienced Ashley Cole the only other left-footed left-back in the squad - Michael Ball and Gareth Barry are in the England Under-21 party - Powell may well find himself an important part of England's World Cup aspirations; not bad for a 31-year-old who was once on loan to Aldershot. Eriksson's choice in goal may be simplified by the news that David Seaman has suffered a recurrence of a back injury. David James started against Spain but it was Nigel Martyn who saved a penalty.",

One of Mrs Thatcher's last Downing Street photo-calls had her being hugged by Gascoigne (\"she was nice and warm and cuddly-like\"). </p> <p>He switched on the Christmas lights in London's Regent Street. He was voted overwhelming winner of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year. When Lazio offered \u00a38m for him - which helped bail out his debt-ridden club - the MP Dennis Skinner pointed out in the House of Commons that Gascoigne's worth was \u00a32m more than Britain's total aid to Bangladesh. </p> <p>On his television show, Terry Wogan introduced Gascoigne as \"literally the most famous and probably the most popular man in Britain today\". When the high street jeweller Gerald Ratner was desperate to atone for calling his own products \"crap\", he hired Gascoigne to appear in advertisements insisting, \"It's world-class stuff, man.\" In the first week of the Gulf War, the Sun cleared its front page for the boldest of headlines: GAZZA &amp; FIANCEE SPLIT UP. </p> <p>When Arsenal that spring paraded the League Championship trophy to Islington Town Hall, every speech from the balcony was drowned by the throng chanting: \"Gazza is a knobhead.\" Gascoigne recorded Fog on the Tyne, which reached the top 10. </p> <p>In the High Court that winter, Gascoigne sued Penguin Books for publishing an \"unauthorised biography\". His counsel Michael Silverleaf began: \"Mr Gascoigne is a very well-known footballer,\" at which Mr Justice Harman interjected (to laughter, as they say): \"Rugby or Association?\" Later, during evidence, the judge again interrupted: \"Isn't there an operetta called La Gazza Ladra?\" \"I could not say, my lord,\" replied Silverleaf. </p> <p>When Judge Harman asked, \"Do you think Mr Gascoigne is more famous now than the Duke of Wellington was in 1815?\" Silverleaf replied: \"I have to say I think it possible.\" Reporters reckoned this revelation turned the case in Penguin's favour. </p> <p>Acres of newsprint were devoted to the footballer. The highbrow reviews waded in. Salman Rushdie soared to ridiculous, exclamation-mark heights in the Independent magazine. Granta published a Gazza treatise running to thousands of overblown words. In the London Review of Books, editor Karl Miller saw Gascoigne as \"fierce and comic, formidable and vulnerable, orphan-like, waif-like... tense and upright, a priapic monolith\". Poet Ian Hamilton noted the player's \"odd elfin humours, an over-eager version of Lear's Fool\". The opera and film director Franco Zeffirelli wrote how enchanted he was \"when Gazza smells the referee's armpits\". </p> <p>The voluptuous free-kick in the semi-final at Wembley, wrote Colin Gibson in the Daily Telegraph, \"flashed 35 yards past the ruin of Arsenal's defensive wall and David Seaman could only help it into the roof of the net. Thereafter Gascoigne remained drunk on the euphoria of the moment, wanting to collect every free-kick, collect every ball from the goalkeeper, and run at every defender\". </p> <p>Back at Wembley for the final, Gascoigne lasted less than 15 minutes, severely injuring himself in the second of two crazily uncontrolled, adrenalin-charged fouls. \"Gazzamania\" changed tack. A vintage, ruinous Rake's Progress took shape. In the next 10 years, injury and unsavoury exposure taking equal turn, Gascoigne played with ever diminishing grandeur for Lazio, Rangers and Middlesbrough.</p> <p>This month, as Tottenham prepare to play Arsenal in another FA Cup semi-final, Gascoigne returned after injury for 19 minutes as a substitute for Everton against Newcastle. It was reported that the 33-year-old meaningfully touched the ball but once.</p>",

When Arsenal that spring paraded the League Championship trophy to Islington Town Hall, every speech from the balcony was drowned by the throng chanting: \"Gazza is a knobhead.\" Gascoigne recorded Fog on the Tyne, which reached the top 10. In the High Court that winter, Gascoigne sued Penguin Books for publishing an \"unauthorised biography\". His counsel Michael Silverleaf began: \"Mr Gascoigne is a very well-known footballer,\" at which Mr Justice Harman interjected (to laughter, as they say): \"Rugby or Association?\" Later, during evidence, the judge again interrupted: \"Isn't there an operetta called La Gazza Ladra?\" \"I could not say, my lord,\" replied Silverleaf. When Judge Harman asked, \"Do you think Mr Gascoigne is more famous now than the Duke of Wellington was in 1815?\" Silverleaf replied: \"I have to say I think it possible.\" Reporters reckoned this revelation turned the case in Penguin's favour. Acres of newsprint were devoted to the footballer. The highbrow reviews waded in. Salman Rushdie soared to ridiculous, exclamation-mark heights in the Independent magazine. Granta published a Gazza treatise running to thousands of overblown words. In the London Review of Books, editor Karl Miller saw Gascoigne as \"fierce and comic, formidable and vulnerable, orphan-like, waif-like... tense and upright, a priapic monolith\". Poet Ian Hamilton noted the player's \"odd elfin humours, an over-eager version of Lear's Fool\". The opera and film director Franco Zeffirelli wrote how enchanted he was \"when Gazza smells the referee's armpits\". The voluptuous free-kick in the semi-final at Wembley, wrote Colin Gibson in the Daily Telegraph, \"flashed 35 yards past the ruin of Arsenal's defensive wall and David Seaman could only help it into the roof of the net. Thereafter Gascoigne remained drunk on the euphoria of the moment, wanting to collect every free-kick, collect every ball from the goalkeeper, and run at every defender\". Back at Wembley for the final, Gascoigne lasted less than 15 minutes, severely injuring himself in the second of two crazily uncontrolled, adrenalin-charged fouls. \"Gazzamania\" changed tack. A vintage, ruinous Rake's Progress took shape. In the next 10 years, injury and unsavoury exposure taking equal turn, Gascoigne played with ever diminishing grandeur for Lazio, Rangers and Middlesbrough. This month, as Tottenham prepare to play Arsenal in another FA Cup semi-final, Gascoigne returned after injury for 19 minutes as a substitute for Everton against Newcastle. It was reported that the 33-year-old meaningfully touched the ball but once.",

      "byline": "John Crace",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Drive towards Raml\u00fcng along the perimeter fence of Zurich airport and the first thing you notice is the bright yellow neon M burning through the grey mist. Chicago, Paris, Delhi, Streatham High Road - the logo is instantly recognisable throughout the world. But as you get nearer, it becomes apparent that the iconography is not all it seems. Along with several more giant Ms and a general smearing of yellow and red, there are a number of truncated Ms that turn out to be rather more tastefully sized Hs. Also in yellow. </p> <p>The Golden Arch is the world's first McDonald's hotel. Profits have been flat in the fast-food burger business, so brand diversification is hardly unexpected. What is surprising is the way it came about. Zurich was not chosen as the result of a massive global focus group or boardroom horse-trading, but on one man's whim. Urs Hammer, McDonald's 52-year-old multi-millionaire chairman and CEO in Switzerland, is a hotelier and architect manqu\u00e9, and the Golden Arch is his brainchild. When he first suggested the idea three years ago to Jim Skinner, McDonald's European supremo, he was told to \"stick to hamburgers\". </p> <p>But he didn't. In two weeks' time, Hammer opens his second hotel in Lully, and has plans for a third in Geneva. Meanwhile, the rest of the corporation holds its breath to see whether the McHotel will bankroll the business for the next few decades or turn out be an expensive midlife crisis. </p> <p>The McDonald's yellows and reds dominate the lobby and bar area, and much of the furniture has been designed to reflect the company logo. But where the burger bars are all plastic, the hotel is maple and leather, with feng shui waterfalls and scattered rose petals. And that's not the only difference. When I go to check in, the woman behind the counter asks, \"Can I help?\" in a voice that sounds uncannily as if she means it. </p> <p>Not that you need to check in, mind. Along with its determinedly modernist design, the hotel is equipped with all the latest hi-tech gadgets, which allow you to check in and out with the swipe of a credit card, and surf the net and pick up email from the TV. At least you can if you are able to operate the controls. The same goes for the light switches, which work with a smart card. Or idiot card, perhaps as it takes several minutes of scrabbling around in the dark to locate the holder. Even the beds, which cost \u00a33,500 apiece, are interactive. They are fashionably low-slung, and can be moved around so that you can lie down with your feet or head in the air. Or both. </p> <p>Once you can see, it's clear the room is not your conventional hotel box. Two items dominate: an M-shaped headboard and a mauve satin sash with the ubiquitous yellow H laid across the bed. Which is a pity, because if neither were there you could quite forget you were in McDonald's. </p> <p>The sleeping area has a hardwood floor, while the washing area contains the nearest you get to traditional McDonald's values with a not-unattractive green Styrofoam floor covering. Or rather, I assumed it was Styrofoam, but was later politely informed that it was state-of-the-art anti-bacterial non-slip tiling.

      "bodyText": "Drive towards Raml\u00fcng along the perimeter fence of Zurich airport and the first thing you notice is the bright yellow neon M burning through the grey mist. Chicago, Paris, Delhi, Streatham High Road - the logo is instantly recognisable throughout the world. But as you get nearer, it becomes apparent that the iconography is not all it seems. Along with several more giant Ms and a general smearing of yellow and red, there are a number of truncated Ms that turn out to be rather more tastefully sized Hs. Also in yellow. The Golden Arch is the world's first McDonald's hotel. Profits have been flat in the fast-food burger business, so brand diversification is hardly unexpected. What is surprising is the way it came about. Zurich was not chosen as the result of a massive global focus group or boardroom horse-trading, but on one man's whim. Urs Hammer, McDonald's 52-year-old multi-millionaire chairman and CEO in Switzerland, is a hotelier and architect manqu\u00e9, and the Golden Arch is his brainchild. When he first suggested the idea three years ago to Jim Skinner, McDonald's European supremo, he was told to \"stick to hamburgers\". But he didn't. In two weeks' time, Hammer opens his second hotel in Lully, and has plans for a third in Geneva. Meanwhile, the rest of the corporation holds its breath to see whether the McHotel will bankroll the business for the next few decades or turn out be an expensive midlife crisis. The McDonald's yellows and reds dominate the lobby and bar area, and much of the furniture has been designed to reflect the company logo. But where the burger bars are all plastic, the hotel is maple and leather, with feng shui waterfalls and scattered rose petals. And that's not the only difference. When I go to check in, the woman behind the counter asks, \"Can I help?\" in a voice that sounds uncannily as if she means it. Not that you need to check in, mind. Along with its determinedly modernist design, the hotel is equipped with all the latest hi-tech gadgets, which allow you to check in and out with the swipe of a credit card, and surf the net and pick up email from the TV. At least you can if you are able to operate the controls. The same goes for the light switches, which work with a smart card. Or idiot card, perhaps as it takes several minutes of scrabbling around in the dark to locate the holder. Even the beds, which cost \u00a33,500 apiece, are interactive. They are fashionably low-slung, and can be moved around so that you can lie down with your feet or head in the air. Or both. Once you can see, it's clear the room is not your conventional hotel box. Two items dominate: an M-shaped headboard and a mauve satin sash with the ubiquitous yellow H laid across the bed. Which is a pity, because if neither were there you could quite forget you were in McDonald's. The sleeping area has a hardwood floor, while the washing area contains the nearest you get to traditional McDonald's values with a not-unattractive green Styrofoam floor covering. Or rather, I assumed it was Styrofoam, but was later politely informed that it was state-of-the-art anti-bacterial non-slip tiling. By the way, the words sleeping and washing areas are used advisedly as there are no separate rooms; the circular power shower - the hot water is generated by heat given off from the restaurant chip pans - is discreetly boxed into one corner of the bedroom. Or possibly it's the other way round. To complete the image overhaul, there is no sign over the hot tap warning you that hot water might come out of it and nor are the walls coated in migraine-inducing primary colours. It's all surprisingly tasteful and unpretentious. Inevitably, there is a downside, and at the Golden Arch it comes when you want to eat.

Peter Mandelson might look like Fleet Street's scalp but, in truth, he was brought down by the eagle-eyed Lib Dem Norman Baker.

We do finally know what the former chief inspector of schools thought about the education secretary - but only because the chief inspector turned reporter and told us himself. We still suffer from the Official Secrets Act, absurd libel laws, the culture of secrecy in government and the failure to introduce a decent Freedom of Information Act; and it looks as though we are about to suffer a new privacy law, created by unelected judges at the behest of unedifying celebrities. </p> <p>For all that, the art of investigative reporting is hanging on to life. The greatest single lesson of last year's course at the University of Sussex was the scale of enthusiasm that survives for the idea of the reporter as troublemaker. Within a fortnight of the course being announced, about 500 people had applied for the 200 tickets - from as far as Shetland, Dublin and Hong Kong, all of them would-be journalists or working journalists wanting to break free and use their job to make a difference.

At the end of the final day, two TV presenters confided that they were going to resign to become \"real reporters\", and even some of the veterans confessed that they had learned from each other. </p> <p>So this year, we're doing it again, this time at the University of Sheffield, and we're giving away 50 places to students through a national contest (see below for details). </p> <p>If the course works, it does so partly because the teachers inspire.

He is the only print journalist to win the award of Journalist of the Year twice, with an extraordinary track record through some of the most devastating scandals of the past 30 years - the Philby affair, thalidomide, Profumo, the whole long season of classics from the old Sunday Times Insight team. </p> <p>The course should work, too, as a disclosure of technique - the daily nuts and bolts of investigation. So, Don Hale, currently Journalist of the Year, is going to relive the old-fashioned, door-stepping, clue-sifting detective work that - despite death threats and judicial lethargy - led to his securing the release of Stephen Downing after 27 years of wrongful imprisonment. A lot of this work involves side-stepping legal obstacles, and we'll look specifically at the Official Secrets Act from the point of view both of the reporter and the whistleblower: Mark Hollingsworth, who broke the story of MI5 officer David Shayler will share a platform with Shayler himself (unless someone in heavy boots is stupid enough to stop him). </p> <p>John Troup, who ran the Bruce Grobbelaar match-fixing story for the Sun, will talk about covert filming and his seven-year libel marathon.

      "bodyText": "Millions of general election leaflets printed by the Tories and Liberal Democrats may have to be pulped after the parties failed to spot the significance of a change in the laws governing elections. Officials at Conservative Central Office contacted the electoral commission last week after receiving legal advice that their leaflets breached the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. The two parties printed their leaflets under the old rules, which required parties to publish the names of the printer and the publisher, who is usually the election agent. Under the rules that came into force last month, parties have to add the candidate's name to the formal list at the bottom of leaflets and posters. The act says the name and address \"of any person on behalf of whom the material is being published\" must be added. The Lib Dems' lawyers told them they did not need to worry about the new rule because the name of a parliamentary agent would make it clear that the leaflet was being published on behalf of a candidate. Alarm bells started ringing last week, however, when the Tories' lawyers said leaflets printed under the old rules would be in breach of the new law. When David Prior, Conservative MP for Norfolk North, who is chief executive of the party, asked the electoral commission for clarification, it said it would provide an answer within a week. One Tory MP, who was about to have his leaflets printed locally under the old rules, said: \"I have telephoned my printer and told him to stop the presses. \"I have already printed my posters, and hope I will be able to add stickers to all 1,500 of them, if the commission rules against us.\" Labour has abided by the law, which it introduced to make it clearer to voters who is publishing election literature. The law will also make it easier for the electoral commission, which has to monitor spending by the parties, to check whether accounts submitted by candidates tally with the numbers of posters and leaflets printed. The confusion over the leaflets came as the Conservatives faced an embarrassing leak from their election advertising agency, Yellow M. In a series of internal memos the agency said the public had an \"ingrained distrust\" of the Tories, who were seen to \"govern for themselves and people like them\". Labour will step up its attacks on the Tories by releasing an election video which likens their leader, William Hague, to Damien, the devil's son in The Omen II. The video, which is to be handed out to voters, opens with footage of Margaret Thatcher accompanied by the soundtrack from the film. The video warns people who rejoiced at her downfall: \"They forgot one thing: there was a son,\" then shows Mr Hague's notorious teenage speech to the Tory conference in 1977.",

But that doesn't mean that the Hammond report on the Hindujas or the Filkin report on Keith Vaz (or even the sheepish privileges committee report on Dr John Reid) don't matter. They do, greatly. They are symptoms of reforming zeal running into the sands.</p> <p>How, if you're Wicks, do you turn this tide? How do you and your team find a role at the heart of the action, as Lord Nolan once did? The committee stands at the apex of regulation. But, as we can see from the past few weeks, it can perilously easily drift into forgetfulness. Its chosen (or prescribed) modus operandi doesn't work any longer.</p> <p>The idea, from the start, was to publish a long series of reports which could be the foundation stones for standards in dodgy areas (which others could police).

      "body": "<p>For reasons which only psychiatrists can explain, Homo sapiens love to create the impression of conflict where none really exists. The desire to exaggerate antagonisms is strongest in television journalists. But even normal human beings feel an urge to promote bogus confrontation. That unhappy inclination has marred much of the debate on the best way to control the foot and mouth outbreak. And it has been used by fox-hunting enthusiasts as proof that they are a persecuted minority. The notion that town is at war with country is patently absurd.</p> <p>Baroness Mallalieu, who chairs the Countryside Alliance, promoted the hostility which she claims to deplore by telling the House of Lords last week: \"We are dividing our nation and our countryside\". All I know of the baroness is that her father was the best journalist to come out of the House of Commons since the war and that she is the author of the remarkable claim that fox-hunters regard the chase as their \"poetry, music and literature\". In a free country, Baroness Mallalieu is entitled to be a total philistine. But she is not entitled, if we place any importance on truth, to pretend that town is in conflict with country.</p> <p>Lord Rees-Mogg recently devoted one of his Times columns to the same claim. It was actually headlined \"Two nations divided at the farm gate\". His lordship often writes of his west country birth and parentage. But he is one of the most metropolitan figures I have ever met. He embodies the way in which Great Britain - in which few of us live very far from either town or country - enjoys a happy partnership of rural and urban communities. I hope that, in my more modest way, I represent the same union of interests and instincts.</p> <p>The village in which I was born has now been totally absorbed into the city of Sheffield. But the bedroom where I once did my homework still looks out onto the beginning of the moors. Now, I spend the happiest times of my life further west along the Derwent valley. But the idea that I have to take sides in a battle between my workdays and weekends is palpable nonsense. If I had to fight in the phoney war, I would offer my sword to the country. But I would still believe that the hostilities were the unnecessary invention of people who hope to improve their image by posturing as saviours of Arcadia.</p> <p>There is something about fields and forests which make the middle classes feel that living in the country is proof of social superiority. It is, I suppose, a relic of the industrial revolution. The landless peasants were driven into the towns to mind the engines of Victorian Britain while the gentry remained on the enclosed land. In its way, the desire to be conspicuously associated with rural life is a perverse version of Cobbett's backward glance. There was a time when a man could ride from London to Winchester and never see a forge or a mill. That was the age of innocence, the time before the Fall. The country is the Garden of Eden from which we were all ejected.</p> <p>The farmers I know best have no time for such rubbish, or for propaganda about urban Britain being indifferent to their problems. It is the suburbs and the inner cities which buy what they produce. Even Tess of the D'Urbervilles realised that the late night trains which belched fire across Wessex were taking milk to London hotels. Sensible farmers know that town and country live in partnership. And the fox-hunters among them do not pretend that it is only townies who would prohibit blood sports. How could they suggest anything so stupid when there are abolitionists living in every village?</p> <p>The farmers who are embarrassed by the \"sympathetic\" stories which are now being told about them would happily do without Prince Charles's talk of family suicides and pictures of weeping at byre doors. They read Bel Mooney's description of her Herefords' \"sweet, curly topknots\" and realised at once that a lady journalist who tells her cows \"out loud how sweet they are\" does not farm for a living. A year ago I watched - for as long as I could bear it - while a vet assisted in the difficult delivery of a calf. I was immensely impressed by the care and concern displayed by the farmer who owned the reluctant mother. But I did not expect him to sing the new-born baby to sleep.</p> <p>Because I am at home in the country I feel no obligation to suggest that it is entirely populated by noble yeomen who, like their fathers and grandfathers, represent all that is best in the British character. Many of them do. Some of them do not. All of them would be best served if, at their time of trouble, newspapers were supportive without being maudlin. Farmers are remarkably like the rest of us - which is why they deserve our help.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

That unhappy inclination has marred much of the debate on the best way to control the foot and mouth outbreak. And it has been used by fox-hunting enthusiasts as proof that they are a persecuted minority. The notion that town is at war with country is patently absurd. Baroness Mallalieu, who chairs the Countryside Alliance, promoted the hostility which she claims to deplore by telling the House of Lords last week: \"We are dividing our nation and our countryside\". All I know of the baroness is that her father was the best journalist to come out of the House of Commons since the war and that she is the author of the remarkable claim that fox-hunters regard the chase as their \"poetry, music and literature\". In a free country, Baroness Mallalieu is entitled to be a total philistine. But she is not entitled, if we place any importance on truth, to pretend that town is in conflict with country. Lord Rees-Mogg recently devoted one of his Times columns to the same claim. It was actually headlined \"Two nations divided at the farm gate\". His lordship often writes of his west country birth and parentage. But he is one of the most metropolitan figures I have ever met. He embodies the way in which Great Britain - in which few of us live very far from either town or country - enjoys a happy partnership of rural and urban communities. I hope that, in my more modest way, I represent the same union of interests and instincts. The village in which I was born has now been totally absorbed into the city of Sheffield. But the bedroom where I once did my homework still looks out onto the beginning of the moors. Now, I spend the happiest times of my life further west along the Derwent valley. But the idea that I have to take sides in a battle between my workdays and weekends is palpable nonsense. If I had to fight in the phoney war, I would offer my sword to the country. But I would still believe that the hostilities were the unnecessary invention of people who hope to improve their image by posturing as saviours of Arcadia. There is something about fields and forests which make the middle classes feel that living in the country is proof of social superiority. It is, I suppose, a relic of the industrial revolution. The landless peasants were driven into the towns to mind the engines of Victorian Britain while the gentry remained on the enclosed land. In its way, the desire to be conspicuously associated with rural life is a perverse version of Cobbett's backward glance. There was a time when a man could ride from London to Winchester and never see a forge or a mill. That was the age of innocence, the time before the Fall. The country is the Garden of Eden from which we were all ejected. The farmers I know best have no time for such rubbish, or for propaganda about urban Britain being indifferent to their problems. It is the suburbs and the inner cities which buy what they produce. Even Tess of the D'Urbervilles realised that the late night trains which belched fire across Wessex were taking milk to London hotels. Sensible farmers know that town and country live in partnership. And the fox-hunters among them do not pretend that it is only townies who would prohibit blood sports. How could they suggest anything so stupid when there are abolitionists living in every village? The farmers who are embarrassed by the \"sympathetic\" stories which are now being told about them would happily do without Prince Charles's talk of family suicides and pictures of weeping at byre doors. They read Bel Mooney's description of her Herefords' \"sweet, curly topknots\" and realised at once that a lady journalist who tells her cows \"out loud how sweet they are\" does not farm for a living. A year ago I watched - for as long as I could bear it - while a vet assisted in the difficult delivery of a calf. I was immensely impressed by the care and concern displayed by the farmer who owned the reluctant mother. But I did not expect him to sing the new-born baby to sleep. Because I am at home in the country I feel no obligation to suggest that it is entirely populated by noble yeomen who, like their fathers and grandfathers, represent all that is best in the British character. Many of them do. Some of them do not. All of them would be best served if, at their time of trouble, newspapers were supportive without being maudlin. Farmers are remarkably like the rest of us - which is why they deserve our help. comment@theguardian.com",

They say a consultant's study reported that building the bypasses and developing an out-of-town business park near Bexhill could lead to 300 jobs being lost in Hastings.</p> <p>The roads are also opposed by English Nature and the Countryside Agency, who warn they would increase traffic in surrounding towns and raise pressure for more road building in the Brede Valley and the new South Downs National Park.</p> <p>Gillian Bargery, joint co-ordinator of the Hastings Alliance said: \"These destructive bypasses aren't the answer to Hastings traffic problems.</p> <p>\"The schemes are another piece in the jigsaw towards a south coast motorway. They will attract traffic from the M25, threatening conservation towns like Rye and the new South Downs National Park with more congestion and road building.</p> <p>\"The \u00a3130m earmarked for these roads would be far better spent on local transport and regeneration initiatives to bring Hastings the revitalisation it so badly needs.\"</p> <p>The bypass schemes threaten to destroy a number of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs).</p> <p>In Doleham plans for the eastern bypass involve levelling out the valley to enable the road to pass above the Hastings-Ashford railway line. The area is home to rare species of plants, and the streams provide vital breeding grounds for sea trout. The streams will be encased in concrete culverts underground if the plans go ahead, transforming the valley.</p> <p>Meanwhile plans for the bypass to the west of Hastings include a 12-metre concrete viaduct running through Combe Haven, a wildlife reserve and a potentially important archeological site.</p> <p>Steve Gilbert, RSPB senior conservation officer for South East England, said: \"The Hastings bypasses will cause damage and disturbance to designated Sites of Special Scientific Interest which are nationally important wildlife sites, as well as harming ancient woodlands and causing wider, unacceptable harm to the environment.</p> <p>\"We urge the secretary of state to find alternative solutions for Hastings.\"</p>",

Today the country's leading environmental groups will launch a united front to try to stop the most controversial road building schemes since Twyford Down and Newbury from going ahead. Friends of the Earth, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and English Nature are among the environmental heavyweights demanding John Prescott block two bypass schemes around the East Sussex town, which they claim will devastate some of the country's most important wildlife sites. The South East Regional Assembly formally approved the roads last month and the decision about whether or not to go ahead now lies with the deputy prime minister. If he gives his consent the protesters have promised that Hastings will become Labour's very own Twyford Down or Newbury bypass - where middle Englanders stood shoulder to shoulder with ecowarriors in an unlikely alliance against roadbuilding schemes sanctioned by the Conservatives. \"We thought Labour had learnt their lesson from the Tories that building roads through middle England is a deeply unpopular thing to do,\" said Tony Bosworth, FoE's transport campaigner. \"But it appears they are determined to learn the lesson the hard way. \"Hastings is the new line in the sand, the new test of the government's pledge to protect wildlife sites in the countryside and to reduce traffic levels.\" The controversial bypasses are supported by many in the local area, including the local Labour MP, Michael Foster, who said the roads will help to regenerate the decaying seaside resort, ranked 28th in the list of poorest towns in Britain. But the Hastings Alliance, which also comprises the Council for the Protection of Rural England, Transport 2000, WWF, Wildlife Trusts and the Council for National Parks, claim that the schemes could have a negative impact on employment figures in the area. They say a consultant's study reported that building the bypasses and developing an out-of-town business park near Bexhill could lead to 300 jobs being lost in Hastings. The roads are also opposed by English Nature and the Countryside Agency, who warn they would increase traffic in surrounding towns and raise pressure for more road building in the Brede Valley and the new South Downs National Park. Gillian Bargery, joint co-ordinator of the Hastings Alliance said: \"These destructive bypasses aren't the answer to Hastings traffic problems. \"The schemes are another piece in the jigsaw towards a south coast motorway. They will attract traffic from the M25, threatening conservation towns like Rye and the new South Downs National Park with more congestion and road building. \"The \u00a3130m earmarked for these roads would be far better spent on local transport and regeneration initiatives to bring Hastings the revitalisation it so badly needs.\" The bypass schemes threaten to destroy a number of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs). In Doleham plans for the eastern bypass involve levelling out the valley to enable the road to pass above the Hastings-Ashford railway line. The area is home to rare species of plants, and the streams provide vital breeding grounds for sea trout. The streams will be encased in concrete culverts underground if the plans go ahead, transforming the valley. Meanwhile plans for the bypass to the west of Hastings include a 12-metre concrete viaduct running through Combe Haven, a wildlife reserve and a potentially important archeological site. Steve Gilbert, RSPB senior conservation officer for South East England, said: \"The Hastings bypasses will cause damage and disturbance to designated Sites of Special Scientific Interest which are nationally important wildlife sites, as well as harming ancient woodlands and causing wider, unacceptable harm to the environment. \"We urge the secretary of state to find alternative solutions for Hastings.\"",

      "bodyText": "The law lords who make up Britain's highest court will face an unprecedented challenge this week to their right as an entirely male court to decide whether women who accuse men of rape should face questions in court about their past sex lives. There has never been a female law lord. A leading QC from Matrix chambers, where Cherie Booth is a founding member, will argue that five male judges cannot be an impartial court in deciding where the balance lies between the right of male defendants to a fair trial and the rights of their female accusers to privacy and dignity. Murray Hunt QC, for the Fawcett Society, a campaigning group for women's rights, is due to make the argument in the form of an application to intervene in a landmark case going to the lords next Monday. The lords must decide whether a \"rape shield\" law which came into force in December, making evidence of a woman's sexual past inadmissible in deciding whether she consented, violates a defendant's right to a fair trial. The case concerns a man, who cannot be named, who was due to stand trial the day after the new law came into force. His counsel argued he would be denied a fair trial, as guaranteed by the Human Rights Act, if he could not bring out evidence that his accuser had willingly had sex with him the week before. Dozens of rape cases in England and Wales are on hold pending the outcome of this case. Home Office ministers introduced the law, part of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, because crown court judges were thought to be too freely exercising their discretion to allow defence counsel to cross-examine rape complainants. Ministers believed women were regularly asked questions about their sex lives which were humiliating and irrelevant to the issue of consent but made juries more likely to acquit the accused. Mr Hunt argues that a fair-minded member of the public would fear that a court without a female voice would unconsciously favour the interests of male defendants. Now that the Human Rights Act is in force, the law lords can expect to see a growth in the number of cases involving sensitive social issues. When challenges to rape shield laws were twice mounted before the supreme court of Canada, women judges were on the bench. The Fawcett Society is calling on the law lords to ensure that two women sit on the five-strong panel for the case. But the 12 law lords are all male, and so are the other 15 peers - current and former lord chancellors and retired law lords - entitled to sit on House of Lords cases. Mr Hunt argues that the simplest solution would be to appoint two female law lords. That decision would be for the government, but the law lords could make the suggestion. The most senior female judge in England and Wales is Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, president of the high court's family division. There are two female appeal court judges, Dame Brenda Hale and Dame Mary Arden. Appointments can be made to the lords direct from the high court, though it is rare. The law lords have already agreed to receive written representations in defence of the law from women's groups, led by Justice for Women. The home secretary, Jack Straw, has also briefed lawyers to defend the law and to try to dissuade the judges from making a finding that the law is incompatible with the European convention on human rights. Baroness Kennedy of the Shaws - Helena Kennedy QC, a Labour peer - said: \"We are one of the few countries with no women in the supreme court. Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United States all have women.\" She urged the law lords to read a 1991 judgment by Canada's first woman chief justice, Beverley McLachlin, who said male judges were often influenced by their experiences and attitudes to sexuality.",

      "bodyText": "Keith Vaz faced renewed pressure to resign last night, after the Tories announced that they would call on the parliamentary standards watchdog to reopen her investigation of the minister for Europe. As three Labour MPs called on Mr Vaz to consider his position, the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, Andrew Lansley, said he would ask Elizabeth Filkin, parliamentary commissioner for standards, to examine a claim that the minister failed to declare an alleged financial link with the Hinduja brothers. The Sunday Times disclosed yesterday that in 1995 the Hinduja Foundation paid nearly \u00a31,200 to Mapesbury Communications, a company set up by Mr Vaz. The money helped to pay for an Indian spiritual leader's visit to the Commons. Mr Lansley said he would refer the matter to Ms Filkin because Mr Vaz had told her he had never received any financial support from the Hindujas. A spokesman for Mr Vaz dismissed the allegation, first made in the Mail on Sunday last month. At the time Mr Vaz said Sir Gordon Downey, former standards commissioner, had advised him that he did not have to declare his involvement with Mapesbury if he did not receive any benefits. The 1995 donation fell into this category because Mapesbury is run by his wife. Mr Vaz is facing intense pressure from within his party to stand down as minister. Ms Filkin was unable to complete her inquiry into eight out of 18 complaints when Mr Vaz's solicitors refused to answer further questions last December. Eric Illsley, MP for Barnsley Central, said: \"If you don't co-operate, how can you be exonerated? If we are not going to co-operate with these bodies it puts us in the same boat as [the Tories]. It leaves a sour taste in my mouth.\" His remarks were echoed by Bill Olner, MP for Nuneaton, and by Peter Kilfoyle, MP for Liverpool Walton, Mr Vaz faced added pressure yesterday after it was disclosed that he has overturned immigration officers' decisions on up to 50 occasions since he took charge of overseeing visa applications to Britain in 1999. In a parliamentary written reply to David Rendel, Liberal Democrat MP for Newbury, the Foreign Office confirmed that Mr Vaz had overruled decisions by the high commission in India 18 times to bar Indian nationals from entering Britain. But ministerial sources at the FO said they had been impressed by the close interest Mr Vaz had paid to visas.

Nevertheless, she adds, in the case of email communication \"the new law doesn't change things as much as define them, by granting copyright to anything communicated.\"</p> <p>One of the major concerns at ANU, and other institutions of higher learning, is the prickly, and as yet unanswered, question of what the new communication right will mean in monetary terms.</p> <p>Universities in Australia currently pay considerable fees to collecting societies in order that they may access material. These societies could well use the law change to seek further remuneration from universities wishing to communicate the material, according to Ms Vance.</p> <p>Little matter, says the University of Queensland's Dr Dempsey, for whom the most pressing concern is what she considers to be the technological illiteracy among her country's lawmakers.</p> <p>As she explains it, the major problem with the recent changes to the Copyright Act is that the drafters \"were attempting to deal with technologies with which they were not familiar\".</p> <p>\"The real issue that exists, not only for academics but also for the general populous, is that the definitions within the Act are flawed.\"</p> <p>In Dr Dempsey's view, the legislation reveals an ignorance of how modern computer programs work - as revealed, for example, in the fact that it is now illegal for Australian students to tweak or improve a firm's code - in other words, iron out bugs - in the interests of making a system run more efficiently and effectively.</p> <p>The question now arises whether anybody at a university posting home-made \"fixes\" to sites are going to be caught for breach of copyright, she says.</p> <p>\"The law should offer a defence to prevent otherwise honest persons from liability in such cases.\"</p>",

Among the more notable amendments to the law is the bestowal of full copyright protection for works created or transmitted in digital form, which until now have not enjoyed the legal status of their hard-copy based counterparts. The Digital Agenda Act, which came into force on March 4, recognises what it calls a \"technology-neutral right of communication\" for the authors of any written work, whether it be created with a quill pen or computer keyboard. The law also imposes new civil and criminal penalties on the manufacture, importation and supply of so-called circumvention devices - which is to say, software designed to get around password protection or software locks.

The law makes no distinction in this respect between emails containing material crafted with obvious skill and labour, and plainly intended for commercial sale, and humdrum messages containing office gossip or holiday plans. In addition, all material in online form will be deemed at the end of every 12 months to be a fresh reproduction and a fresh communication, and as such will require the fresh permission of its creator if it is to remain, for example, on a university's website. \"This is a very wide issue,\" says Rachel Vance, the legal officer at the Australian National University, in Canberra. Nevertheless, she adds, in the case of email communication \"the new law doesn't change things as much as define them, by granting copyright to anything communicated.\" One of the major concerns at ANU, and other institutions of higher learning, is the prickly, and as yet unanswered, question of what the new communication right will mean in monetary terms. Universities in Australia currently pay considerable fees to collecting societies in order that they may access material. These societies could well use the law change to seek further remuneration from universities wishing to communicate the material, according to Ms Vance. Little matter, says the University of Queensland's Dr Dempsey, for whom the most pressing concern is what she considers to be the technological illiteracy among her country's lawmakers. As she explains it, the major problem with the recent changes to the Copyright Act is that the drafters \"were attempting to deal with technologies with which they were not familiar\". \"The real issue that exists, not only for academics but also for the general populous, is that the definitions within the Act are flawed.\" In Dr Dempsey's view, the legislation reveals an ignorance of how modern computer programs work - as revealed, for example, in the fact that it is now illegal for Australian students to tweak or improve a firm's code - in other words, iron out bugs - in the interests of making a system run more efficiently and effectively. The question now arises whether anybody at a university posting home-made \"fixes\" to sites are going to be caught for breach of copyright, she says. \"The law should offer a defence to prevent otherwise honest persons from liability in such cases.\"",

      "body": "<p>Museums will close and have their collections warehoused or scattered as the \"golden age\" of lottery-backed expansion comes to a halt, according to a report published today .</p> <p>The huge expansion, bringing science, environment and art-based attractions and extensions to museums, left the sector with an extra \u00a329m a year bill for increased costs in a static or declining market, the author, Adrian Babbidge, suggested.</p> <p>The most spectacular casualties so far are the Faith Centre in Bradford, the Centre for Popular Music in Sheffield and the Centre for the Visual Arts in Cardiff, but more closures are predicted for the next few years among the traditional museums.</p> <p>Museums also face increased competition, from rival attractions and from innovations such as Sunday trading. Mr Babbidge, director of the East Midlands Museums Service, said that in his area the opening of Ikea, the furnishings store, has had a perceptible impact on museum visiting on Sunday, formerly the busiest day.</p> <p>Mr Babbidge, who has also worked at museums in Essex and Wales, has published his grim forecast in Cultural Trends, the journal of the Policy Studies Institute.</p> <p>He suggested that the museum sector had been expanding unsustainably since the 1960s. The lottery had provided a unique opportunity for funding to catch up.</p> <p>However, his analysis shows that the bulk of the lottery money spent on museums since 1995, 55% of more than \u00a3500m, has gone on new museums, extensions or renewal of existing buildings.</p> <p>Just under half the money went to national museums, but cash for the regionals, more than \u00a3300m, could have solved the problems of decades of underfunding, particularly the backlog of collections' care and documentation. Instead he calculated that the new spaces created would cost an extra \u00a329m a year to maintain, making the problem worse.</p> <p>The report shows a startling division in the government's regional spending on museums, from 6p per head of the population in the east midlands and 15p per head in the west midlands to \u00a39.59 per head in the south-east, where most of the national museums, directly supported by the government, are concentrated. The north-west is in second place, at \u00a32.63 per head.</p> <p>The gap should be filled by local authority spending, but Mr Babbidge's figures show that after a slow rise until 1995 overall spending on revenue and capital support has been falling. The fall is steepest in the south-west: 6% down between 1994 and 1999.</p> <p>His study suggests that part of the regions' problem is the rapid growth in the 1960s, when dozens of branch museums opened in libraries and other public spaces. Thirty-nine of these have closed, and he predicted more to come.</p> <p>Wages in the sector were not only well below other public sector wages (in turn considerably lower than the private sector), said Mr Babbidge, but the gap was widening. In 1973 an average museum professional, with a degree and usually a post-graduate qualification, earned \u00a32,178, compared with \u00a32,464 for a graduate school teacher. The comparative salaries were now \u00a316,771 and \u00a323,193.</p> <p>\"Financial prospects for entrants are limited, at a time when most will have to begin to pay off overdrafts and student loans.For many, and especially for those from poorer families, a museum career is highly unattractive.\"</p> <p>Mr Babbidge challenged the government to formulate a genuine national policy for all English museums, in which coherent decisions could be taken.</p> <p>\"Instead we get interventions in the market, like the recent announcement on VAT, which could make it cheaper for people to get on a train and go to the Science Museum in London, if it becomes free, than to visit their local museum if it charges.</p> <p>\"If museums are going to close, and I believe they will, there has to be a policy in place in which sensible decisions can be taken about the fate of their collections.\"</p> <p>A Department of Culture spokesman dismissed the findings as unduly alarmist. \"The problems of regional museums are precisely the remit of the task force recently announced by the government, and it would be wrong to prejudge their findings.</p> <p>\"Resource [the museums, galleries and archives council] is considering long term policy for museums and will also be deciding the best allocation of the \u00a320m extra announced last year for regional museums.\"</p> <p><b>Concepts that took the cash and failed</b><br></p> <p>\u0095 The Life Force Centre, beside Bradford Cathedral, which cost \u00a35m including a \u00a32.2m millennium grant, closed last month after seven months. It was projected to attract 40,000 people a year, but in its first week had 62 paying visitors.</p> <p>\u0095 The National Centre for Popular Music, in Sheffield, closed last August after 16 months. It cost \u00a315m, with \u00a311m in lottery grants. The spectacular building was projected to attract 400,000 people a year, but drew fewer than a quarter of that.</p> <p>\u0095 The Centre for Visual Arts in Cardiff closed in November, after attracting 47,500 instead of 220,000 visitors in its first year. The transformation of a listed former library building cost \u00a39m, including a \u00a33m lottery grant.</p> <p><b>Related article:</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,458822,00.html\">VAT error may mean entry charges</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Museums will close and have their collections warehoused or scattered as the \"golden age\" of lottery-backed expansion comes to a halt, according to a report published today . The huge expansion, bringing science, environment and art-based attractions and extensions to museums, left the sector with an extra \u00a329m a year bill for increased costs in a static or declining market, the author, Adrian Babbidge, suggested. The most spectacular casualties so far are the Faith Centre in Bradford, the Centre for Popular Music in Sheffield and the Centre for the Visual Arts in Cardiff, but more closures are predicted for the next few years among the traditional museums. Museums also face increased competition, from rival attractions and from innovations such as Sunday trading. Mr Babbidge, director of the East Midlands Museums Service, said that in his area the opening of Ikea, the furnishings store, has had a perceptible impact on museum visiting on Sunday, formerly the busiest day. Mr Babbidge, who has also worked at museums in Essex and Wales, has published his grim forecast in Cultural Trends, the journal of the Policy Studies Institute. He suggested that the museum sector had been expanding unsustainably since the 1960s. The lottery had provided a unique opportunity for funding to catch up. However, his analysis shows that the bulk of the lottery money spent on museums since 1995, 55% of more than \u00a3500m, has gone on new museums, extensions or renewal of existing buildings. Just under half the money went to national museums, but cash for the regionals, more than \u00a3300m, could have solved the problems of decades of underfunding, particularly the backlog of collections' care and documentation. Instead he calculated that the new spaces created would cost an extra \u00a329m a year to maintain, making the problem worse. The report shows a startling division in the government's regional spending on museums, from 6p per head of the population in the east midlands and 15p per head in the west midlands to \u00a39.59 per head in the south-east, where most of the national museums, directly supported by the government, are concentrated. The north-west is in second place, at \u00a32.63 per head. The gap should be filled by local authority spending, but Mr Babbidge's figures show that after a slow rise until 1995 overall spending on revenue and capital support has been falling. The fall is steepest in the south-west: 6% down between 1994 and 1999. His study suggests that part of the regions' problem is the rapid growth in the 1960s, when dozens of branch museums opened in libraries and other public spaces. Thirty-nine of these have closed, and he predicted more to come. Wages in the sector were not only well below other public sector wages (in turn considerably lower than the private sector), said Mr Babbidge, but the gap was widening. In 1973 an average museum professional, with a degree and usually a post-graduate qualification, earned \u00a32,178, compared with \u00a32,464 for a graduate school teacher. The comparative salaries were now \u00a316,771 and \u00a323,193. \"Financial prospects for entrants are limited, at a time when most will have to begin to pay off overdrafts and student loans.For many, and especially for those from poorer families, a museum career is highly unattractive.\" Mr Babbidge challenged the government to formulate a genuine national policy for all English museums, in which coherent decisions could be taken. \"Instead we get interventions in the market, like the recent announcement on VAT, which could make it cheaper for people to get on a train and go to the Science Museum in London, if it becomes free, than to visit their local museum if it charges. \"If museums are going to close, and I believe they will, there has to be a policy in place in which sensible decisions can be taken about the fate of their collections.\" A Department of Culture spokesman dismissed the findings as unduly alarmist. \"The problems of regional museums are precisely the remit of the task force recently announced by the government, and it would be wrong to prejudge their findings. \"Resource [the museums, galleries and archives council] is considering long term policy for museums and will also be deciding the best allocation of the \u00a320m extra announced last year for regional museums.\" Concepts that took the cash and failed \u0095 The Life Force Centre, beside Bradford Cathedral, which cost \u00a35m including a \u00a32.2m millennium grant, closed last month after seven months. It was projected to attract 40,000 people a year, but in its first week had 62 paying visitors. \u0095 The National Centre for Popular Music, in Sheffield, closed last August after 16 months. It cost \u00a315m, with \u00a311m in lottery grants. The spectacular building was projected to attract 400,000 people a year, but drew fewer than a quarter of that. \u0095 The Centre for Visual Arts in Cardiff closed in November, after attracting 47,500 instead of 220,000 visitors in its first year. The transformation of a listed former library building cost \u00a39m, including a \u00a33m lottery grant. Related article: VAT error may mean entry charges",

      "body": "<p>While it is normal for viewers to graduate from Newsround to watching News At Ten, drama about education has rarely been able to exploit its catchment group in the same way. The children's series Grange Hill is one of the longest-running TV dramas ever, but there have often been difficulties in persuading the audience to move up from little school to big school. Lucy Gannon's Hope And Glory, with Lenny Henry as a headmaster, was less popular than her other series; another TV writer, Jimmy McGovern, was also critically marked down for a show about teachers; and Steven Moffat, writer of the triumphant sit-com Coupling, preceded it with Chalk, a widely disliked comprehensive comedy. </p> <p>The most likely explanation for this is that classroom fiction - from Jennings and Mallory Towers through to Grange Hill - has mainly been aimed at children. Adult licence-payers, on the other hand, find it regressive to look at rooms in which more than one character is sitting at a desk. </p> <p>Teachers (Channel 4) is the latest attempt to take the form into long trousers. After the lessons learned from television history mentioned above, the advance publicity for the series has been careful to suggest that the action begins when the hometime bell goes. Channel 4 has implied an NUT version of This Life, one of the stars of which, Andrew Lincoln (\"Egg\"), plays Simon, the main teacher in this. </p> <p>But, while Simon's sex life is intensely studied, his professional existence scores a good 60% of the air-time. Tim Loane's script is strongest when you feel you're getting staff room gossip, as, for example, in a scene where Simon bribes colleagues in the pub with drinks to mark his pupils' exercise books for him. </p> <p>The first episode also contains a running discussion about teaching methods. In common with the heroes of all adult school dramas on TV or in cinema, Simon is an inspirational maverick who wins the respect of the students by breaking the rules. The kids address him by his first name and, teaching Romeo And Juliet, he effortlessly relates it to the world of hip-hop and condoms. Envious colleagues try to turn him into a bore at the blackboard. In other words, Simon is yet another fictional member of the Dead Poets Society. </p> <p>If Teachers were a set text in TV Studies, you'd start your class by chalking up the words \"Comedy Of Inversion\". The main gag here is that the teachers do what students would usually be expected to do. Drunk after a party, the staff break in and vandalise the school; when asked by their pupils if they've finished marking the homework, they prevaricate with ridiculous excuses; they break the smoking ban in the lavatories and, eventually, Simon and a colleague are called to see the head after a fight. This back-flip gag makes a funny introduction to the series, but a car driven in reverse can only make a short journey. </p> <p>There was once a television Head Of Comedy who marked prospective scripts like a teacher, acknowledging each joke with a large red tick. Only when the sheets of paper looked like the exercise books of the Head Boy fast-tracked for Oxbridge could the programme be commissioned. If Happiness (BBC2) were subjected to this process, the script's parents would be called in for urgent talks and the sit-com threatened with detention. But I am happy to act as the show's social worker. </p> <p>Its truant humour and surly refusal to yell out punchlines when asked is all to a purpose. Starring Paul Whitehouse - who also co-wrote the series with David Cummings - this is a strange and bold attempt to make a sit-com about subjects traditionally confined to the coffin-shaped box of tragedy. </p> <p>A Dr Freud of television comedy might surmise that Whitehouse, his pathway to success accelerated by The Fast Show, had come to worry that he was winning laughs too easily. Psychologically he needed to go for the hard laughs. The point of catch-phrase comedy is that the audience knows exactly when to laugh. The speeches of leading politicians are typed out with white spaces between phrase called \"applause gaps\". Sketch shows and traditional sit-coms are written with cackle gaps. </p> <p>The writing in Happiness offers no such guidance. The opening scenes are admittedly skittish. Whitehouse's character, Danny, is a comedian who provides the voice of a popular children's character, a cuddly toy who combines martial and medical arts, called Kung-Fu Nurse Bear. We cut from this convincing silliness - the bear was made by Aardman, creator of Wallace &amp; Gromit - to Danny waking bleakly alone in a double bed, then drinking whisky for breakfast. You guess divorce, but are surprised when the large chauffeur-driven car to which he walks in the next scene has the appearance of an undertaker's vehicle. It is. His wife has died. </p> <p>It's not unprecedented for a sit-com to begin with a funeral - Penelope Keith's To The Manor Born did - but, where the Keith vehicle used the scene to introduce a merry widow, Whitehouse is a genuinely grief-stricken widower. Some people will object that it's mislabelling to call this a comedy, that it's like an advertised pop concert that turns out to consist of a piano concerto. But the gap between the pain of Danny's condition and the inanity of his profession serves as an extreme expression of the performer's dilemma. The project does feel psychologically motivated - a slow show after The Fast Show - but there's a pleasure in the risks it takes with sit-com. </p> <p>\u0095 Teachers, Wednesday, 10pm, Channel 4.

But, while Simon's sex life is intensely studied, his professional existence scores a good 60% of the air-time. Tim Loane's script is strongest when you feel you're getting staff room gossip, as, for example, in a scene where Simon bribes colleagues in the pub with drinks to mark his pupils' exercise books for him. The first episode also contains a running discussion about teaching methods. In common with the heroes of all adult school dramas on TV or in cinema, Simon is an inspirational maverick who wins the respect of the students by breaking the rules. The kids address him by his first name and, teaching Romeo And Juliet, he effortlessly relates it to the world of hip-hop and condoms. Envious colleagues try to turn him into a bore at the blackboard. In other words, Simon is yet another fictional member of the Dead Poets Society. If Teachers were a set text in TV Studies, you'd start your class by chalking up the words \"Comedy Of Inversion\". The main gag here is that the teachers do what students would usually be expected to do. Drunk after a party, the staff break in and vandalise the school; when asked by their pupils if they've finished marking the homework, they prevaricate with ridiculous excuses; they break the smoking ban in the lavatories and, eventually, Simon and a colleague are called to see the head after a fight. This back-flip gag makes a funny introduction to the series, but a car driven in reverse can only make a short journey. There was once a television Head Of Comedy who marked prospective scripts like a teacher, acknowledging each joke with a large red tick. Only when the sheets of paper looked like the exercise books of the Head Boy fast-tracked for Oxbridge could the programme be commissioned. If Happiness (BBC2) were subjected to this process, the script's parents would be called in for urgent talks and the sit-com threatened with detention. But I am happy to act as the show's social worker. Its truant humour and surly refusal to yell out punchlines when asked is all to a purpose. Starring Paul Whitehouse - who also co-wrote the series with David Cummings - this is a strange and bold attempt to make a sit-com about subjects traditionally confined to the coffin-shaped box of tragedy. A Dr Freud of television comedy might surmise that Whitehouse, his pathway to success accelerated by The Fast Show, had come to worry that he was winning laughs too easily. Psychologically he needed to go for the hard laughs. The point of catch-phrase comedy is that the audience knows exactly when to laugh. The speeches of leading politicians are typed out with white spaces between phrase called \"applause gaps\". Sketch shows and traditional sit-coms are written with cackle gaps. The writing in Happiness offers no such guidance. The opening scenes are admittedly skittish. Whitehouse's character, Danny, is a comedian who provides the voice of a popular children's character, a cuddly toy who combines martial and medical arts, called Kung-Fu Nurse Bear. We cut from this convincing silliness - the bear was made by Aardman, creator of Wallace &amp; Gromit - to Danny waking bleakly alone in a double bed, then drinking whisky for breakfast. You guess divorce, but are surprised when the large chauffeur-driven car to which he walks in the next scene has the appearance of an undertaker's vehicle. It is. His wife has died. It's not unprecedented for a sit-com to begin with a funeral - Penelope Keith's To The Manor Born did - but, where the Keith vehicle used the scene to introduce a merry widow, Whitehouse is a genuinely grief-stricken widower. Some people will object that it's mislabelling to call this a comedy, that it's like an advertised pop concert that turns out to consist of a piano concerto. But the gap between the pain of Danny's condition and the inanity of his profession serves as an extreme expression of the performer's dilemma. The project does feel psychologically motivated - a slow show after The Fast Show - but there's a pleasure in the risks it takes with sit-com. \u0095 Teachers, Wednesday, 10pm, Channel 4.

      "body": "<p>The current policy of slaughter to eradicate the foot and mouth outbreak is being reconsidered by the ministry of agriculture as the number of cases reaches epidemic proportions and the idea of using vaccines becomes more attractive.</p> <p>Influential vets, some with experience of using vaccination to combat the spread of the disease in other countries, have been increasingly vocal as the difficult task of carcass disposal has dismayed both farmers and the public.</p> <p>Vaccination would end the need to immediately slaughter healthy animals in who have come in contact with the disease. It would also end the problem of decomposing carcasses in fields being eaten by rats and crows - although there is scant evidence that this spreads the disease, since the rats and crows would have to carry infected meat to other farm animals.</p> <p>But vaccination is no easy answer either, because of the commercial penalties it imposes. There are two alternatives: either vaccinating millions of farm animals, or just vaccinating those in the immediate area of an outbreak, creating what is termed a \"fire break\", to prevent the disease spreading to new areas.</p> <p>The idea of vaccinating everything has immediate appeal, because after all that is how humans eradicated smallpox, and the move is favoured by animal welfare groups. However, commercially the idea does not make such sound sense.</p> <p>The world is divided into places that have foot and mouth and those that are disease free - and until four weeks ago the UK and the whole of the EU came into the latter category.</p> <p>A disease free status has enormous commercial advantages because it means meat, animal products, live animals, bull semen, and high value pedigree stock can be exported anywhere in the world. Once stock becomes contaminated by foot and mouth, export bans automatically follow and cannot be restored until the disease has been eradicated.</p> <p>If a country has vaccinated animals, then the disease free status is lost even if there are no active outbreaks. To regain it then, the animals that have been vaccinated in the \"fire breaks\" have to be slaughtered. Only then when all the diseases and vaccinated animals are dead can exports begin again, and then only after an interval of three to six months, depending on the rules of the importing country.</p> <p>Vets in favour of vaccination are divided on whether it is necessary to slaughter the vaccinated animals or let them live out their lives \"normally\", having young free of the disease and so continuing pedigree lines that might otherwise be lost. This latter course would mean a much longer period before the disease free status could be regained.</p> <p>The good news is that plenty of vaccine exists: 10m doses in the EU, and plenty readily available in the UK. There are three types because there are three strains of foot and mouth, but type O vaccine, of the type the UK would need, is available.</p> <p>So the issue is not whether vaccination works - it does. The argument is whether it is the best method of eradicating the disease in the quickest time and returning the farming industry to \"normal\".</p> <p>As the number of outbreaks continues to increase, the pro-vaccination lobby is gaining ground. So far the ministry is not convinced, although a contingency plan is actively being worked on.</p> <p>The likely outcome of the great vaccination debate is too close to call. The decision rests mainly on whether the current policy of containing the disease works. If it fails, then vaccination is the only remaining option.</p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,443686,00.html\">Full list: outbreaks and precautionary measures</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a></p> <p><b>The front line</b><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">05.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,451194,00.html\">13.03.2001: 'The town is uncannily quiet'</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,451194,00.html\">16.03.2001: Watching, waiting and hoping</a><br>What is the situation on the ground?

      "bodyText": "The current policy of slaughter to eradicate the foot and mouth outbreak is being reconsidered by the ministry of agriculture as the number of cases reaches epidemic proportions and the idea of using vaccines becomes more attractive. Influential vets, some with experience of using vaccination to combat the spread of the disease in other countries, have been increasingly vocal as the difficult task of carcass disposal has dismayed both farmers and the public. Vaccination would end the need to immediately slaughter healthy animals in who have come in contact with the disease. It would also end the problem of decomposing carcasses in fields being eaten by rats and crows - although there is scant evidence that this spreads the disease, since the rats and crows would have to carry infected meat to other farm animals. But vaccination is no easy answer either, because of the commercial penalties it imposes. There are two alternatives: either vaccinating millions of farm animals, or just vaccinating those in the immediate area of an outbreak, creating what is termed a \"fire break\", to prevent the disease spreading to new areas. The idea of vaccinating everything has immediate appeal, because after all that is how humans eradicated smallpox, and the move is favoured by animal welfare groups. However, commercially the idea does not make such sound sense. The world is divided into places that have foot and mouth and those that are disease free - and until four weeks ago the UK and the whole of the EU came into the latter category. A disease free status has enormous commercial advantages because it means meat, animal products, live animals, bull semen, and high value pedigree stock can be exported anywhere in the world. Once stock becomes contaminated by foot and mouth, export bans automatically follow and cannot be restored until the disease has been eradicated. If a country has vaccinated animals, then the disease free status is lost even if there are no active outbreaks. To regain it then, the animals that have been vaccinated in the \"fire breaks\" have to be slaughtered. Only then when all the diseases and vaccinated animals are dead can exports begin again, and then only after an interval of three to six months, depending on the rules of the importing country. Vets in favour of vaccination are divided on whether it is necessary to slaughter the vaccinated animals or let them live out their lives \"normally\", having young free of the disease and so continuing pedigree lines that might otherwise be lost. This latter course would mean a much longer period before the disease free status could be regained. The good news is that plenty of vaccine exists: 10m doses in the EU, and plenty readily available in the UK. There are three types because there are three strains of foot and mouth, but type O vaccine, of the type the UK would need, is available. So the issue is not whether vaccination works - it does. The argument is whether it is the best method of eradicating the disease in the quickest time and returning the farming industry to \"normal\". As the number of outbreaks continues to increase, the pro-vaccination lobby is gaining ground. So far the ministry is not convinced, although a contingency plan is actively being worked on. The likely outcome of the great vaccination debate is too close to call. The decision rests mainly on whether the current policy of containing the disease works. If it fails, then vaccination is the only remaining option. What's going on?

Yet such was the magnitude of Schumacher's victory that many faces wore a quizzical expression at the end of the afternoon.</p> <p>But in reality the outcome of the race was decisively influenced by an inspired strategic call from the Ferrari team management. They gambled to switch their cars on to intermediates rather than full rain tyres when they splashed into the pits at the end of the fourth lap as the heavens opened and cars spun in all directions.</p> <p>However, it was a nerve-rackingly close call for the famous Italian team. On lap three both Ferraris had flown off the road on a patch of water at the point where Olivier Panis's BAR-Honda had spun off after its engine expired. And the pit stop was botched when Schumacher had to queue behind Barrichello after a dithering pit crew put a full wet tyre on the Brazilian's right front before quickly replacing it with an intermediate to match the other three wheels.</p> <p>But Ferrari were immeasurably assisted by a safety car which stayed out from lap three to lap 10, enabling Barrichello and Schumacher to catch up the tail of the queue led by Coulthard. And once the pack was unleashed again the Ferraris simply stormed into fast-forward action, Schumacher slicing ahead of his team-mate on lap 12 to take sixth place. </p> <p>\"It was a very exciting race,\" he said. \"It was my decision to fit intermediate tyres, which we knew would be difficult at first but would be better when the rain eased. </p> <p>\"After the pit stop I asked if the team had made the right changes to the car because it was difficult to drive, but it got better as the race went on. The conditions were atrocious and undriveable, and at times the safety car was quicker than us.\"</p> <p>Coulthard kept manfully ahead until lap 15 but it was a lost cause. He was on full wets, grappling with incipient understeer, while the Ferraris were using their intermediates to brilliant, some would say scarcely credible effect. </p> <p>Barrichello went through into second at the end of lap 16 and from then on the Ferrari team-mates waltzed away with the race, which strengthened their grip on the points table.</p> <p>Not that the race finished with unconditional love and kisses between the Ferrari drivers. Barrichello said the uncompromising manner in which Schumacher had passed him was \"a bit sad\". The Brazilian, who had already collided with Schumacher's younger brother Ralf on the first corner, had just told Ferrari's technical director Ross Brawn over the radio that there was a lot of dirt on the circuit and that Michael needed to take care. But clearly the champion had his own ideas. \"Michael took a chance,\" said Barrichello. \"It was not what you would expect a team-mate to do.\"</p> <p>Schumacher countered: \"We're team-mates, we respect each other, we leave each other room not to hurt each other, but I was on a better go and I was faster as well. We are in equal situations so you fight for the position; I don't think that's unreasonable.\" </p> <p>McLaren's chief executive Ron Dennis criticised what he saw as Ferrari's massive gamble of switching to intermediates. \"There was absolutely no way we would have put our drivers on to intermediates,\" he said. \"David was complaining that conditions were impossible at 100mph. In rain like that you can't take the decision to put drivers' safety at risk in conditions like this.\"</p> <p>Both McLarens came home in the points, Mika Hakkinen coming sixth, unable to pass Ralf Schumacher's Williams-BMW despite rattling off four consecutive fastest laps on new rubber after a late second pitstop; both finished behind Heinz-Harald Frentzen's fourth-placed Jordan and ahead of Jos Verstappen, a superb seventh in the Arrows A22. But Dennis put a gloss on the result. \"I felt we were in good shape, but they were in a difficult situation and they took a calculated risk. But I think these things reverse themselves over time.\"</p> <p>Coulthard's assessment of the McLaren situation was more downbeat. \"We know we've still got a long way to go,\" said the Scot. \"We were one second a lap off the pace in Australia and two seconds a lap away here. Yes, it's pretty grim.\" </p> <p>Yet even Schumacher knows not to count McLaren out at this early stage of the season. This time last year they had not a single championship point to their credit but they bounced back spectacularly to challenge for the title. After yesterday's disappointment, Coulthard and Hakkinen are keeping their fingers crossed that history will repeat itself.</p>",

This was Schumacher's 46th career win and his sixth successive triumph since Monza last year, achieved behind the wheel of his spare Ferrari F2001, which he took shortly before the start after traces of a possible oil leak were detected on his No1 machine. It was a stunning performance which saw the German at one point lapping 6.3sec faster than the third finisher David Coulthard's McLaren-Mercedes on a track which was still patchy damp as it dried out in the sweltering heat. However, the performance of the Italian cars inevitably rekindled the distrust and suspicion that has existed in the formula one fraternity over the past few years over the possible use of traction-control systems which, although now illegal, will be allowed for the fifth race of the season. These systems, which can effectively reduce the power delivery to the rear wheels when they detect any possibility of wheelspin, can be duplicated legally by complex electronic engine-mapping which anticipates wheelspin. Within the formula one regulations there is a fine but very specific dividing line between the two systems, and there is no doubt that Ferrari's system - deemed legal by the FIA - does a remarkably effective job. Yet such was the magnitude of Schumacher's victory that many faces wore a quizzical expression at the end of the afternoon. But in reality the outcome of the race was decisively influenced by an inspired strategic call from the Ferrari team management. They gambled to switch their cars on to intermediates rather than full rain tyres when they splashed into the pits at the end of the fourth lap as the heavens opened and cars spun in all directions. However, it was a nerve-rackingly close call for the famous Italian team. On lap three both Ferraris had flown off the road on a patch of water at the point where Olivier Panis's BAR-Honda had spun off after its engine expired. And the pit stop was botched when Schumacher had to queue behind Barrichello after a dithering pit crew put a full wet tyre on the Brazilian's right front before quickly replacing it with an intermediate to match the other three wheels. But Ferrari were immeasurably assisted by a safety car which stayed out from lap three to lap 10, enabling Barrichello and Schumacher to catch up the tail of the queue led by Coulthard. And once the pack was unleashed again the Ferraris simply stormed into fast-forward action, Schumacher slicing ahead of his team-mate on lap 12 to take sixth place. \"It was a very exciting race,\" he said. \"It was my decision to fit intermediate tyres, which we knew would be difficult at first but would be better when the rain eased. \"After the pit stop I asked if the team had made the right changes to the car because it was difficult to drive, but it got better as the race went on. The conditions were atrocious and undriveable, and at times the safety car was quicker than us.\" Coulthard kept manfully ahead until lap 15 but it was a lost cause. He was on full wets, grappling with incipient understeer, while the Ferraris were using their intermediates to brilliant, some would say scarcely credible effect. Barrichello went through into second at the end of lap 16 and from then on the Ferrari team-mates waltzed away with the race, which strengthened their grip on the points table. Not that the race finished with unconditional love and kisses between the Ferrari drivers. Barrichello said the uncompromising manner in which Schumacher had passed him was \"a bit sad\". The Brazilian, who had already collided with Schumacher's younger brother Ralf on the first corner, had just told Ferrari's technical director Ross Brawn over the radio that there was a lot of dirt on the circuit and that Michael needed to take care. But clearly the champion had his own ideas. \"Michael took a chance,\" said Barrichello. \"It was not what you would expect a team-mate to do.\" Schumacher countered: \"We're team-mates, we respect each other, we leave each other room not to hurt each other, but I was on a better go and I was faster as well. We are in equal situations so you fight for the position; I don't think that's unreasonable.\" McLaren's chief executive Ron Dennis criticised what he saw as Ferrari's massive gamble of switching to intermediates. \"There was absolutely no way we would have put our drivers on to intermediates,\" he said. \"David was complaining that conditions were impossible at 100mph. In rain like that you can't take the decision to put drivers' safety at risk in conditions like this.\" Both McLarens came home in the points, Mika Hakkinen coming sixth, unable to pass Ralf Schumacher's Williams-BMW despite rattling off four consecutive fastest laps on new rubber after a late second pitstop; both finished behind Heinz-Harald Frentzen's fourth-placed Jordan and ahead of Jos Verstappen, a superb seventh in the Arrows A22. But Dennis put a gloss on the result. \"I felt we were in good shape, but they were in a difficult situation and they took a calculated risk. But I think these things reverse themselves over time.\" Coulthard's assessment of the McLaren situation was more downbeat. \"We know we've still got a long way to go,\" said the Scot. \"We were one second a lap off the pace in Australia and two seconds a lap away here. Yes, it's pretty grim.\" Yet even Schumacher knows not to count McLaren out at this early stage of the season. This time last year they had not a single championship point to their credit but they bounced back spectacularly to challenge for the title. After yesterday's disappointment, Coulthard and Hakkinen are keeping their fingers crossed that history will repeat itself.",

When Mr Kinnock failed to win the 1992 election and stepped down, Mr Clarke learned swiftly how out of favour become the aides of former leaders. He had to become the chief executive of a consultancy advising the association of district councils. However good his contacts, his pursuit of parliamentary seats proved difficult. Before he found Norwich South, he was shortlisted for Newham North East, but lost out in a controversial, and rerun, selection contest. After winning in Norwich in 1997, with a comfortable 14,239 majority, he took up where he had left off with Neil Kinnock - heading for the top. Ask Aristotle about Charles Clarke",

At one such meeting in October 1983 he urged the left to \"have the guts to support all workers who have the guts to fight Thatcher.\" Although his devout Methodism has not changed, his vocabulary certainly has since he found a safe Labour seat in ethnically diverse Brent South in 1987. London-born, with a Ghanaian father and a Scottish mother, he is a very active constituency MP, speaking for all his constituents. Paul Boateng gained recognition from Tony Blair as chief architect of Labour's 1995 policy document on the legal profession, and for steering through the family law bill.

      "body": "<p>Anyone in any doubt that Football Man is not what he was needed only watch the Ali G interview on Comic Relief with England's most celebrated player and his wife. I mean, could you imagine Bobby Charlton in his heyday taking his lovely wife on to TV to be quizzed by Dick Emery about their preferred sexual position? (Well, you could, but it's probably not advisable.) Nobody, as far as I recall - even for charity - ever thought to ask Billy Wright how many of the Beverley Sisters he had slept with. </p> <p>Still, autre temps, autre moeurs, as my friend Ron Atkinson would no doubt say. Football has changed irrevocably, and the BBC is currently chronicling this process in a three-part documentary series, The Men Who Changed Football. </p> <p>On the evidence of part one, the story is well told and makes compelling viewing for those of us who have lived through the seismic ground-shifts of the past three decades. My only quibble - and it is a big one - is that it is being treated entirely as a business story. </p> <p>Is it my imagination, or has this country adopted and adapted rather too enthusias tically Calvin Coolidge's famous maxim, \"The chief business of America is business\"? Scarcely a day goes by without another documentary about some 12-year-old dotcom millionaire. Every time I switch on the TV a syrupy voice-over urges me to salt away my wedge in the Leicester and Chester or some such to ensure a comfortable silvery-haired old age playing mini-golf with my grand-kids.

      "bodyText": "Anyone in any doubt that Football Man is not what he was needed only watch the Ali G interview on Comic Relief with England's most celebrated player and his wife. I mean, could you imagine Bobby Charlton in his heyday taking his lovely wife on to TV to be quizzed by Dick Emery about their preferred sexual position? (Well, you could, but it's probably not advisable.) Nobody, as far as I recall - even for charity - ever thought to ask Billy Wright how many of the Beverley Sisters he had slept with. Still, autre temps, autre moeurs, as my friend Ron Atkinson would no doubt say. Football has changed irrevocably, and the BBC is currently chronicling this process in a three-part documentary series, The Men Who Changed Football. On the evidence of part one, the story is well told and makes compelling viewing for those of us who have lived through the seismic ground-shifts of the past three decades. My only quibble - and it is a big one - is that it is being treated entirely as a business story. Is it my imagination, or has this country adopted and adapted rather too enthusias tically Calvin Coolidge's famous maxim, \"The chief business of America is business\"? Scarcely a day goes by without another documentary about some 12-year-old dotcom millionaire. Every time I switch on the TV a syrupy voice-over urges me to salt away my wedge in the Leicester and Chester or some such to ensure a comfortable silvery-haired old age playing mini-golf with my grand-kids. Even in the red-top tabloids these days there are hefty money supplements elbowing out important news stories about Jordan's breast implants. And there were few signs of The Men Who Changed Football departing from the contemporary agenda. The story it told was of the salvation of our national game by \"entrepreneurs, self-made men\", as it described Irving Scholar at Spurs, David Dein at Arsenal and Martin Edwards at Manchester United, although the process of making Edwards must have been helped along somewhat by his dad's successful meat-style-products business. The three were presented largely uncritically. The days before they occupied the boardrooms of our top clubs were the bad old days, the narrator Paul McGann solemnly informed us, \"a national disgrace\". To illustrate the unpretty pass soccer had reached in its pre-entrepreneurial period, we saw scenes of a riot at Old Trafford in 1974, and I am prepared to concede there were genuine horrors to be seen here. The spoon collars, the unfashionable boots, the flared hipsters. It was as if trouble had broken out at a Slade lookalike convention. It was disappointing, though, that the programme gave quite such a hearty round of applause to the men who swept away this ugliness, given that the 70s being trashed in this programme were, one assumes, the same 70s the BBC constantly celebrates in programmes such as Soccer In The Seventies, the same decade in which Liverpool won two European cups, Nottingham Forest one, and even Manchester City won a European trophy. Two words: Rodney Marsh. Part one of the documentary, it is true, took us only as far as 1989, so I shall watch again tomorrow in the hope that the downside of big business's rescue of our national game is covered, or even mentioned. Someone might even point out that the goal that won the championship for Arsenal in 1989, for which David Dein appeared to be taking personal credit, was actually scored by Michael Thomas. There are some great stories to be told, and not all of them revolve round the fight for television rights, about which part one of the documentary seemed to be unnaturally obsessed; although the hero of that story, the man who broke the cosy cartel between BBC and ITV denying football a fair price for its product, turned out to be Greg Dyke, which was nice. At some point, I expect, someone will examine the cross-fertilisation of soccer and showbiz which has brought us such delights as Ian Wright's ITV chat show and reached its apotheosis with Mr and Mrs Beckham's appearance on Comic Relief, the funniest moment of which was Ali G's question to Posh Spice: \"Does Brooklyn like your music, or is he getting a bit old for it now?\" For the most part, though, the best way to deal with Comic Relief was to make a contribution at an early stage and then ignore the rest of the dismal, desperate farrago with a clear conscience.

This makes the agile Mr Hague a tighter prisoner of his party than he would like, and explains why he handcuffed himself to not joining the euro until after the next parliament.</p> <p>Quite how rightwing Mr Hague really is must be open to question. His friends talk of him as an internationalist with liberal inclinations, but there have been few signs of this side of his character on public display. Certainly he has cause to understand the dilemmas of Euroscepticism. As a former star of the McKinsey management consultancy, he knows better than most Tories that many UK-based big businesses will soon be dealing in euros whether or not the electorate like it. Nissan cars, which decided to reinvest in Britain in January 2001 on such a condition, is just the most prominent of many such companies. But he now looks as blinkered as the men and women by whose votes he was elected, and by whose votes he needs to remain in office if he loses the next general election.</p> <p>Although colour blind, he is not himself a gimlet eyed zealot. When he became Welsh secretary in 1995, after John Redwood, he showed himself much more deft and willing to be assimilated than his predecessor, even to the point of marrying Ffion, the young civil servant who taught him enough Welsh to avoid badmouthing the Welsh anthem.</p> <p>In filling his party's frontbench, he prefers to rely on the saner, more reasonable Eurosceptics such as Michael Ancram and, most recently, Michael Portillo. But the prevailing atmosphere of Europhobia has made it impossible for such talents to survive alongside them - and that, surely, has massively hampered his party's chances.</p> <p>It has also forced two clever ex-ministers, Ian Taylor and David Curry, into internal exile on the backbench. Other MPs, such as Peter Temple-Morris and Shaun Woodward, have fled to Labour, in the latter case because homophobia often joins Europhobia on the Tory rightwing. Mr Hague's election promises have also been tailored to control - rather than lead - his party. The Tories' relative success in fighting the euro at the last European elections meant his mini-manifesto, published in late 2000, was both anti-Brussels and drew heavily on the George Bush policy tent of \"compassionate conservatism\". It advocated privatised pensions and universities, as well as forcing single mothers to enter work.</p> <p>He is also constrained by the fact that the Tory party has shrunk from the many millioned broad church mass party it once was to a sectarian group with some 320,000 members, mostly over 60.</p> <p>After two serious recessions and the forced exit from the exchange rate mechanism, it has lost most of its young and middleaged members, particularly those with business links, who lost confidence in Tory economic competence. This shrinkage in membership and business backing left Conservative central office at the mercy of a single Tory billionaire, Michael Ashcroft. The millions he contributed in 1999 and 2000 were indispensable. In 2000, Ashcroft moved to Britain as required for the peerage Mr Hague secured for him.</p> <p>In 2001, ahead of the expected election, the financial situation was eased somewhat by a \u00a35m donation from Stuart Wheeler, owner of a gaming website.</p> <p>All these troubles explain why Mr Hague was initially reluctant to inherit the leadership in the wake of May 1997 and considered becoming deputy to Michael Howard. He even agreed a deal to this effect with the former home secretary, toasting it in champagne. But ambition got the better of him and he broke the pact the next morning.</p> <p>As his party's fortunes failed to improve dramatically after 1997, he must at times have regretted his decision not to serve as Mr Howard's deputy. Had he done so, he might now be his party's rising star, likely to be elected to the Tory leadership after the next election, not ejected from it.</p> <p>His early training in adversity, as a young Tory in the overwhelmingly Labour Rother Valley, must be why any such doubts never show in public. Despite foolish boasts of downing 14 pints a day in his youth, Mr Hague's background is sedate. He was born in Rotherham in 1961, the son of a family of local soft drink manufacturers. He went from Wath-on-Dearne comprehensive to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he chalked up first class honours in PPE before obtaining an MBA with distinction at France's Insead business school.</p> <p>He worked for eight years at top management consultants McKinsey, where his biggest job was advising Oxford on fundraising. This came to an end when he was chosen from among 360 hopefuls for the Yorkshire seat of Richmond, vacated by Leon Brittan in favour of the European commission.</p> <p>In 1989, Mr Hague narrowly squeaked into parliament thanks to a split third party vote. Once there, he moved fast, becoming parliamentary private secretary to Norman Lamont a year later - and so having a hand in the introduction of the fuel price escalator that has so troubled Tony Blair.</p> <p>In 1993, at 32, he became under secretary for social security. A year later he was promoted to minister of state to restore relations with the disabled after the cockups of Nick Scott. John Major wanted to promote him to chief secretary to the Treasury, but chancellor Ken Clarke thought him too rightwing.</p> <p>As leader, his political postures had been mixed. A strong backer of capital punishment, he has also been one of the minority of Tory MPs to vote to reduce the age of homosexual consent to 16, probably converted by his friend and flatmate, Alan Duncan. But his most liberal attitude, of thinking hereditary peers \"silly\", goes back to a little noted Tory conference speech at 19.</p> <p>His best asset is his love of combat at prime minister's questions where his repertoire of humour and debating skills regularly see him triumph over Mr Blair. However, his enthusiasm sometimes gets the better of him - as seen after the resignation of Peter Mandelson in January 2001 when Mr Hague was guilty of dancing on the Northern Ireland secretary's grave.</p> <p>Whether his strong parliamentary skills and love of populist policies will get him through the doors of No 10 remains to be seen.</p> <p><a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/person/0,9290,-2130,00.html\">Ask Aristotle about William Hague</a></p>",

In 2001, ahead of the expected election, the financial situation was eased somewhat by a \u00a35m donation from Stuart Wheeler, owner of a gaming website. All these troubles explain why Mr Hague was initially reluctant to inherit the leadership in the wake of May 1997 and considered becoming deputy to Michael Howard. He even agreed a deal to this effect with the former home secretary, toasting it in champagne. But ambition got the better of him and he broke the pact the next morning. As his party's fortunes failed to improve dramatically after 1997, he must at times have regretted his decision not to serve as Mr Howard's deputy. Had he done so, he might now be his party's rising star, likely to be elected to the Tory leadership after the next election, not ejected from it. His early training in adversity, as a young Tory in the overwhelmingly Labour Rother Valley, must be why any such doubts never show in public. Despite foolish boasts of downing 14 pints a day in his youth, Mr Hague's background is sedate. He was born in Rotherham in 1961, the son of a family of local soft drink manufacturers. He went from Wath-on-Dearne comprehensive to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he chalked up first class honours in PPE before obtaining an MBA with distinction at France's Insead business school. He worked for eight years at top management consultants McKinsey, where his biggest job was advising Oxford on fundraising. This came to an end when he was chosen from among 360 hopefuls for the Yorkshire seat of Richmond, vacated by Leon Brittan in favour of the European commission. In 1989, Mr Hague narrowly squeaked into parliament thanks to a split third party vote. Once there, he moved fast, becoming parliamentary private secretary to Norman Lamont a year later - and so having a hand in the introduction of the fuel price escalator that has so troubled Tony Blair. In 1993, at 32, he became under secretary for social security. A year later he was promoted to minister of state to restore relations with the disabled after the cockups of Nick Scott. John Major wanted to promote him to chief secretary to the Treasury, but chancellor Ken Clarke thought him too rightwing. As leader, his political postures had been mixed. A strong backer of capital punishment, he has also been one of the minority of Tory MPs to vote to reduce the age of homosexual consent to 16, probably converted by his friend and flatmate, Alan Duncan. But his most liberal attitude, of thinking hereditary peers \"silly\", goes back to a little noted Tory conference speech at 19. His best asset is his love of combat at prime minister's questions where his repertoire of humour and debating skills regularly see him triumph over Mr Blair. However, his enthusiasm sometimes gets the better of him - as seen after the resignation of Peter Mandelson in January 2001 when Mr Hague was guilty of dancing on the Northern Ireland secretary's grave. Whether his strong parliamentary skills and love of populist policies will get him through the doors of No 10 remains to be seen. Ask Aristotle about William Hague",

      "bodyText": "Carlton and Granada were today handed a multimillion pound windfall by television regulators. They will save millions of pounds a year thanks to a new deal on the cash they pay the government for their right to broadcast. Shares in the ITV giants rose in early trading after the companies were offered better-than-expected terms to renew their broadcast licences by TV regulators. However, analysts said all ITV companies will benefit from the new licence terms because the amount they pay in the \"percentage of qualifying revenue\", or proportion of advertising income, will fall as the network switches to digital. The deal is part of the government's blueprint for the future of television. The government has offered a \"digital dividend\", or rebate based on the number of viewers who watch the network on digital television. For example, Carlton Communications could save up to \u00a310m a year for every 10% rise in the number of ITV digital viewers. Granada was today asked to pay \u00a34.9m in cash and 17% of its advertising revenue for its LWT licence, and \u00a34.1m and 15% of advertising income for the Granada franchise. The company bid \u00a39m for the Granada licence in the controversial ITV franchise auction in 1991. Carlton's Central franchise was snapped up for a derisory \u00a32,000 a year 10 years ago, but the company has now been offered \u00a37.6m per 12 months. Analysts said the new terms will add \u00a330m to Granada's revenues this year, sending its shares up 4% in early trading. \"Because some investors look for short-term incomes, the licence renewal should have a positive impact. However, the digital dividend has already been factored in to the long-term calculations, so it should not have a huge effect,\" said one analyst. The digital dividend offers a ray of light for beleaguered ITV franchise holders, who have been battered by recession in the TV advertising market. ITV companies will also receive a one-off boost from last week's deal between ITV and Luxembourg-based SES Astra, which will see the network broadcast on digital satellite by the end of the year. Renewal terms for the 10-year licences were also offered for Border, owned by Capital Radio; SMG's Scottish and Grampian; Channel, owned by Channel Television; and Carlton's Central licence.",

Popstars was broadcast on ITV between 6.15pm and 7.05pm. The climax came just before 7pm, when presenter Davina McCall and the five band members heard Pure and Simple had charted at number one. They did a simultaneous live interview with BBC Radio 1 chart show presenter Mark Goodier. The final episode of the series had 7.1m viewers and a 32% audience share, according to unofficial overnights. The show nearly doubled the usual ratings figures for the Sunday night ITV slot. In the past four weeks, ITV regional programming and Worthington Cup final highlights have averaged 3.8m viewers. Elsewhere, the drama of Celebrity Big Brother had completely petered out by Saturday night. The \"uncut\" version of the show - which showed Vanessa in tears and Anthea talking about cooking a magic-mushroom cake - was watched by just 2.7m viewers on Channel 4. BBC1's attempt to inject some life into its troubled Sunday 9pm slot also failed to inspire. Venom, a documentary on poisonous animals, pulled in just 5.2m viewers and a 21% share. ITV opposition London's Burning trounced the show with an audience of 10.2m at 9pm. Earlier in the evening, BBC1 drama Ballykissangel continued to flounder against ITV's Heartbeat between 8.10pm and 9pm. Ballykissangel was watched by just 4.9m viewers while Heartbeat pulled in 12.4m. Channel 4 last night gave terrestrial premieres to two potentially controversial films, 1990s clubbing movie Human Traffic and long-outlawed 1970s erotic flick the Story of O, from 10pm. Human Traffic had 1.4m viewers and a 10% share; while the Story of O drew 0.9m and a 22% share between 12am and 1am.

      "body": "<p>New Labour came into power promising a royal commission into long-term care for the elderly. Matters were in a mess. </p> <p>The previous Tory government had been beleaguered by stories of elderly people having to sell their homes to pay the fees when they went into nursing or residential homes. Newspapers ran articles on elderly homeowners, who had paid tax and national insurance all their lives, and who could now no longer pass the homes they'd worked hard to buy on to their children. It was very bad publicity for a government ostensibly committed to hard-working people and the very British \"right to buy\" your own home.</p> <p>And it was a nightmare for many elderly people who didn't have sufficient funds to pay for their care. Those who were cared for in hospitals received free care. But those with conditions such as Alzheimer's disease who were cared for \"in the community\", including in residential or nursing homes, were means-tested and often ended up paying for their care.</p> <p>After coming to power, New Labour quickly set up a commission in late 1997, headed by Sir Stewart Sutherland, principal of Edinburgh University. The commission took a year to report.</p> <p>But the government attracted criticism by delaying its response - it took nearly as long to answer as it did for the commission to hear from interested parties, gather all the evidence, examine the current set-up and future options, weigh up the pros and cons and come up with proposals. Critics felt that ministers had kicked the issue into the long grass in order to avoid a big public spending pledge. Sir Stewart and all but two of his fellow commissioners recommended that nursing and personal care be funded from general taxation and free at the point of delivery - wherever that \"delivery\" took place - at a cost of roughly \u00a31bn a year.</p> <p>Finally, the government agreed to fund nursing care - but only that given by a qualified nurse, as opposed to, for example, a healthcare assistant. Personal care, such as help with washing, using the toilet, eating and dressing, would still be subject to means tests and paid for by a client who was judged to have enough money to do so.</p> <p>Campaigning groups for the elderly were disappointed at this halfway measure. But they were cheered north of the border when the Scottish executive agreed that personal care would be free, as well as nursing care. This was in spite of the pressure said to have been exerted on Scottish Labour leaders by Labour at Westminster.</p> <p>Now, there will shortly be a situation where older people living just miles from each other in English and Scottish towns will face very different funding arrangements.</p> <p>And then there's the revolt by independent care home owners. For some time, they have been complaining that local authorities have been keeping the rates they pay for care home places - where they, rather than the individual residents, pay them - unrealistically low. The home owners have lobbied parliament, harangued local councillors and a few have even talked of refusing more council placements.</p> <p>Some critics argue that it's not the public sector's job to subsidise private care companies - and that private care home owners should have thought about this when they set their own prices low in order to win the business from the councils, during the era of market testing and compulsory competitive tendering. Others say that money needs to be spent increasingly on supporting older people in their own homes, not in institutions.</p> <p>But some care home owners take pride in their work and offer good quality services - and are horrified that they might be driven out of business by apparently uncaring councillors and a government seemingly deaf to their demands. Small, local care homes will go out of business, they say, to be replaced by big care conglomerates running large homes akin to the huge, old long-stay, geriatric institutions now frowned upon and closed. </p> <p>It's not quite got to the point where frail or confused elderly people are turfed out of their care homes because of a lack of funds. But the battle is hotting up.</p>",

Critics felt that ministers had kicked the issue into the long grass in order to avoid a big public spending pledge. Sir Stewart and all but two of his fellow commissioners recommended that nursing and personal care be funded from general taxation and free at the point of delivery - wherever that \"delivery\" took place - at a cost of roughly \u00a31bn a year. Finally, the government agreed to fund nursing care - but only that given by a qualified nurse, as opposed to, for example, a healthcare assistant. Personal care, such as help with washing, using the toilet, eating and dressing, would still be subject to means tests and paid for by a client who was judged to have enough money to do so. Campaigning groups for the elderly were disappointed at this halfway measure. But they were cheered north of the border when the Scottish executive agreed that personal care would be free, as well as nursing care. This was in spite of the pressure said to have been exerted on Scottish Labour leaders by Labour at Westminster. Now, there will shortly be a situation where older people living just miles from each other in English and Scottish towns will face very different funding arrangements. And then there's the revolt by independent care home owners. For some time, they have been complaining that local authorities have been keeping the rates they pay for care home places - where they, rather than the individual residents, pay them - unrealistically low. The home owners have lobbied parliament, harangued local councillors and a few have even talked of refusing more council placements. Some critics argue that it's not the public sector's job to subsidise private care companies - and that private care home owners should have thought about this when they set their own prices low in order to win the business from the councils, during the era of market testing and compulsory competitive tendering. Others say that money needs to be spent increasingly on supporting older people in their own homes, not in institutions. But some care home owners take pride in their work and offer good quality services - and are horrified that they might be driven out of business by apparently uncaring councillors and a government seemingly deaf to their demands. Small, local care homes will go out of business, they say, to be replaced by big care conglomerates running large homes akin to the huge, old long-stay, geriatric institutions now frowned upon and closed. It's not quite got to the point where frail or confused elderly people are turfed out of their care homes because of a lack of funds. But the battle is hotting up.",

      "bodyText": "The chief veterinary officer, Jim Scudamore, was today meeting farmers in Cumbria whose animals face compulsory slaughter to protect against the spread of foot and mouth disease. Three more outbreaks were confirmed in the county yesterday, bringing the total number of cases in Britain to 326. A cattle farm at Wigton, a cattle and sheep farm at Penrith and a small sheep and cattle holding at Kirkhampton, near Carlisle, were the latest among 89 Cumbrian farms infected with the virus. The government wants to slaughter up to half a million healthy sheep and pigs in the county and in neighbouring Dumfries and Galloway in Scotland to create \"firebreaks\" around the affected farms in an effort to contain the disease. But the decision has proved unpopular among farmers, some of whom greeted Mr Scudamore with a slow handclap when he arrived in Carlisle this morning. Outside a closed meeting between Mr Scudamore, local vets and the National Farmers' Union, livestock farmers protested against the cull. A number of landowners waited outside with a placard reading \"the silence of the lambs for Blair's election?\". Margaret Smith, a farmer's wife from Gretna, said: \"Is this based on epidemiology or political thoughts? I've been talking to one boy whose father's farm is 100 yards outside the killing area. So can Mr Scudamore tell me his sheep are not going to catch foot-and-mouth? \"The disease can travel 60 miles, so why don't they kill for 60 miles?\" she said. Retired farmer Arthur Ogle said the plan to slaughter healthy animals was \"bloody terrible\". He added: \"They will never stop the disease until they stop the way animals are transported.\" The agriculture minister, Nick Brown, has warned that the three-week-old outbreak is likely to persist for several months. A lack of vets is hindering attempts to speed up diagnosis of the disease and the slaughter and disposal of animals. But plans were progressing to involve military personnel in the planning of animal movement and slaughter, junior agriculture minister Baroness Hayman said, with Ministry of Defence officials acting as mobile supervisors. About 120 final-year vet students have also agreed to work alongside trained vets in helping to spot the disease, said deputy chief veterinary officer Martin Atkinson, adding that he hoped that number would rise to about 200. He revealed that the number of vets from the state veterinary service usually working in the field had dropped from about 400 at the time of the 1967 outbreak to just 220 today. Mr Atkinson said that the service was facing an \"unprecedented challenge\", but said that students and vets from overseas were still volunteering to come to Britain. She said the government was considering making inspectors available for each movement of animals, but added that the farming community had an interest in policing itself to stop the spread of disease. Mr Brown was today meeting European Union agriculture commissioner Franz Fischler to discuss possible recovery packages for farmers. He could be ready to make an announcement about aid before the end of the week, Baroness Hayman told a media briefing in London. She said that the government was still considering a number of options, including the possibility of trying to save some rare breeds from being slaughtered. Infected animals would still face certain slaughter, she said, but added: \"We are looking at ways, in particular circumstances where a unique genetic breed would be lost, if there is anything we can do about it.\" What's going on?

      "bodyText": "The Independent Television Commission has upheld viewer complaints against an edition of the ITV daytime talk show Trisha, which featured a woman who fatally stabbed her partner. The ITC ruled than ITV and Anglia, which produced the programme, had been unfair to interview Diana Butler without allowing the family of the deceased, Roger Carlin, to defend him. The watchdog ruled the programme had breached its programme code. \"The programme presented Mr Carlin in an unfair light and did not give due consideration to the perspectives of his family,\" the ITC stated in its February programme complaints and findings report. The ITC received four viewer complaints about the show, which went out on 23 November last year. Mr Carlin's family alleged Ms Butler had been allowed to present herself as the victim of a violent relationship without their son's side of the story being heard. Ms Butler was convicted of murder after fatally stabbing Mr Carlin in July 1996 but the conviction was subsequently quashed on appeal. During the retrial, Ms Butler accepted a prosecution offer of a plea of manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility because she had been a victim of domestic violence. Anglia had refused Mr Carlin's parents' request to appear in the show because Ms Butler was reluctant to appear with them. But the ITC accepted Trisha had introduced some challenging elements into the interview with Ms Butler, including two questions supplied by the Carlin family. Useful link www.itc.org.uk",

      "body": "<p>Should you cancel a holiday in Britain in the light of the foot and mouth outbreak? That really depends on what you are planning to do. Staying in London, with perhaps a few days in Edinburgh or another city, presents very little risk.</p> <p>Foot and mouth, though highly infectious, poses no threat to humans - the danger lies in the possibility that you will spread it as you travel around the countryside.</p> <p>Apart from Richmond Park in south-west London and the Giraffe and Elephant Houses at London Zoo, visitors to London will find that they can travel anywhere within the city without a problem. Nevertheless, an open park only a few minutes outside a city may well be out of bounds.</p> <p>Similarly, if you plan to take the train to Oxford or Cambridge for the day, or hire a car and drive to a town, you are very unlikely to encounter difficulties as long as you stay in the city centre. However, you should avoid walking along the parts of the River Cam in Cambridge where sheep and cows graze, or venturing into a deer park.</p> <p>However, if you are planning to explore the countryside on foot - or you had intended to do some hillwalking - it would be better to cancel the trip. Not only is there a <a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/fmd/footpaths.htm\" target=\"_new\"> \u00a35000 fine</a> for walkers who try to follow a closed path, but people living in rural communities will not take kindly to visitors who seem not to care if they are spreading the virus. Most zoos outside London are shut.</p> <p>Driving along a public road in a rural area is usually perfectly acceptable. However, walking on farmland, moorland, footpaths and bridleways, where sheep, cattle, pigs, deer, goats and other livestock may be grazing, is most definitely not. Unfortunately, this includes many areas used for climbing and mountaineering.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.thebmc.co.uk/outdoor/access/fmd.asp\" target=\"_new\">British Mountaineering Council</a> has an up-to-date list of out-of-bounds places. All of the <a href=\" http://www.anpa.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">National Parks</a>, including the Norfolk Broads, the Lake and Peak Districts, Snowdonia and Exmoor, have been closed.</p> <p>Additionally, all <a href=\" http://www.forestry.gov.uk:81/newsrele.nsf/f4ab217073b7ae17802566210049d340/5c45c0afc436803180256a0100593cde?OpenDocument\" target=\"_new\">Forestry Commission</a> land is closed. Not all woods and forests are owned by the Commission but, unless you want to make yourself very unpopular, it is better to steer clear of them.</p> <p>Many rights of way, or footpaths, have been closed by local councils - a list of them can be found <a href=\"http://194.200.85.11/sources/4000124/4000835/4016400/fm_prow.htm\" target=\"_new\">here</a>. National Trust houses in the countryside - including Blenheim Palace - are all shut, too. But a number of <a href=\" http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/webpack/bin/webpack.exe/livebase?object=LiveBase1&amp;itemurn=8&amp;mode=wbFullItem \" target=\"_NEW\">town properties</a> are still open.</p> <p>The British Tourist Board has a <a href=\" http://www.travelbritain.org/NewHome/newsflash.htm\" target=\"_new\">useful page</a> of advice for those visitors in any doubt. Sadly, the disease is spreading so fast that it looks as though the current restrictions will be in place at least until the end of March, and quite possibly later.</p> <p>The president of the National Farmers' Union, which represents the agricultural community in Britain, recently begged the public: \"Remember the disease could be anywhere - not just in the restricted zones.

      "bodyText": "Should you cancel a holiday in Britain in the light of the foot and mouth outbreak? That really depends on what you are planning to do. Staying in London, with perhaps a few days in Edinburgh or another city, presents very little risk. Foot and mouth, though highly infectious, poses no threat to humans - the danger lies in the possibility that you will spread it as you travel around the countryside. Apart from Richmond Park in south-west London and the Giraffe and Elephant Houses at London Zoo, visitors to London will find that they can travel anywhere within the city without a problem. Nevertheless, an open park only a few minutes outside a city may well be out of bounds. Similarly, if you plan to take the train to Oxford or Cambridge for the day, or hire a car and drive to a town, you are very unlikely to encounter difficulties as long as you stay in the city centre. However, you should avoid walking along the parts of the River Cam in Cambridge where sheep and cows graze, or venturing into a deer park. However, if you are planning to explore the countryside on foot - or you had intended to do some hillwalking - it would be better to cancel the trip. Not only is there a \u00a35000 fine for walkers who try to follow a closed path, but people living in rural communities will not take kindly to visitors who seem not to care if they are spreading the virus. Most zoos outside London are shut. Driving along a public road in a rural area is usually perfectly acceptable. However, walking on farmland, moorland, footpaths and bridleways, where sheep, cattle, pigs, deer, goats and other livestock may be grazing, is most definitely not. Unfortunately, this includes many areas used for climbing and mountaineering. The British Mountaineering Council has an up-to-date list of out-of-bounds places. All of the National Parks, including the Norfolk Broads, the Lake and Peak Districts, Snowdonia and Exmoor, have been closed. Additionally, all Forestry Commission land is closed. Not all woods and forests are owned by the Commission but, unless you want to make yourself very unpopular, it is better to steer clear of them. Many rights of way, or footpaths, have been closed by local councils - a list of them can be found here. National Trust houses in the countryside - including Blenheim Palace - are all shut, too. But a number of town properties are still open. The British Tourist Board has a useful page of advice for those visitors in any doubt. Sadly, the disease is spreading so fast that it looks as though the current restrictions will be in place at least until the end of March, and quite possibly later. The president of the National Farmers' Union, which represents the agricultural community in Britain, recently begged the public: \"Remember the disease could be anywhere - not just in the restricted zones. I implore everyone once again: please, please stay away from the countryside\". Finally, you should seek advice from your own government about their restrictions. Imagine what the consequences might be if you inadvertently bring foot and mouth into your own country. What's going on?

Conscious of the concerns of programme schedulers and people with low saccharine tolerance, the academy is offering the prize of a new high definition television set to the maker of the shortest speech. In a further bid to cut the endless thank yous, it has also offered to allow entire lists of thank yous to be posted on the internet ,so that winners who want to thank \"everyone I have ever met in my life\" can do so in full without delaying the actual ceremony. This year's big steal? No-one seems sure, although if, as one New York rumour has it, Chocolat wins against the odds, there will be plenty of candidates. As for Willie Fulgear, well, he has made it into Vanity Fair's special Oscars issue, but is he happy? \"I wish I'd never seen them Oscars,\" he is quoted as saying. \"I'm taking medication! I am stressed!\" He put $40,000 of the reward money in a safe at his home but when he came back from a trip last June both the safe and the money had gone. He has put the word out to the academy that he would like tickets to this year's event. So far they have not been forthcoming.",

      "bodyText": "The Sunday Times is facing a legal bill of over half-a-million pounds after an award-winning composer successfully sued for libel over an article that said he had falsely claimed credit for the James Bond theme tune. Monty Norman was today awarded \u00a330,000 libel damages by a high court jury over a 1997 article in which the Sunday Times claimed he did not write the James Bond theme. But the total bill is expected to top \u00a3500,000 because of legal costs for the two-week trial. Mr Norman said the Sunday Times article, published under the heading, \"Theme tune wrangle has 007 shaken and stirred\", \"rubbished\" his whole career. The two-week hearing before centred on whether the theme's composer was Mr Norman - who has the work registered with the Performing Rights Society and has always received the royalties - or fellow composer Mr John Barry. Times Newspapers denied libel and argued that Mr Barry was the composer of the tune, described to the court as \"one of the most famous pieces of music in the world\". It first gripped the public imagination in the 1962 movie Dr No. Sixty-seven-year-old Mr Barry has written the soundtracks to many Bond films, as well as Born Free, Zulu and Midnight Cowboy. He told the jury that Mr Norman's claim that he, and he alone, wrote the tune was \"absolute nonsense\". The case for Times Newspapers was that Mr Barry was brought in to write the theme at a late stage - six months into the project - because Mr Norman had run out of inspiration and there was a crisis. The jury announced its verdict today after just over four hours deliberation. Mr Norman was present in court.",

      "bodyText": "Former ITV boss Richard Eyre has quit RTL Group, the owner of Channel 5 and Pearson TV, the independent company behind ITV hits including The Bill and Neighbours. Mr Eyre, the former ITV chief executive, is not thought to have another job to go to. He is believed to have quit RTL because of frustration over his position. \"He thought he was going to have Greg Dyke's job. I am not surprised he is leaving,\" said one former colleague. An RTL spokesman said the company was in a closed period in advance of its annual results on Wednesday and could not comment. Mr Eyre joined Pearson TV in January last year as chief executive - a job vacated by Greg Dyke who had just started as the new director general of the BBC. However, three months later the company merged with CLT-Ufa to creat RTL and Mr Eyre found his role had changed. He acquired a new job title and although he was now working for a bigger company he found he was no longer boss. As RTL Group director of strategy and content, Mr Eyre was only third in the pecking order in the newly merged group. CLT-Ufa chief executive Didier Bellens and chief operating officer Ewald Walgenbach took the same positions within RTL.",

He presided over the 1990 leadership contest which saw the departure of Margaret Thatcher and the arrival of John Major.</p> <p>A member of the secret service, MI6, before he became Conservative MP for Woking in 1964, he briefly held two ministerial offices, as under-secretary for aerospace between 1972-74, and minister of state at the Foreign Office from 1982-83. Particularly hostile to Labour's CND left, he once tagged MP Brian Sedgemore as \"a boil on the bottom of the Labour party - painful to live with, better not mentioned and best kept out of sight\".</p> <p>As a kinsman of the Earl of Onslow, representing a constituency containing the earl's seat, Onslow was one of the last Tory squires.

His replacement as chairman of the 1922 Committee by Fox, a self-made backstreet Thatcherite, seemed to mark the end of an era.</p> <p>Born in Bexhill, Onslow was named after the earl, one of whose titles was Baron Cranley, because his ornithologist father wanted to maintain the family link. After Harrow and Sandhurst, he joined up in 1944, becoming a lieutenant in the Queen's Own Hussars. On leaving active service, he joined the Territorials - thus keeping up his marksmanship - and graduated in history from Oriel College, Oxford.</p> <p>In 1951, he joined M16 and its cover-organisation, the Foreign Office, being posted to Burma in 1953 as third secretary. In 1955, he became consul in Maymyo, north Burma, near the communist Chinese border. Local communist insurgents once attempted to kidnap and ransom him, but by plying him with whisky, Onslow persuaded them to return to the jungle without him.

After resigning from the civil service in 1960, he was elected to Dartford rural district council the same year, and to Kent county council in 1961. Two years later, he was selected as Harold Watkinson's successor for Woking. When elected, the Conservatives described him as director of an unnamed Indian-based news agency.</p> <p>From his maiden speech in December 1964, Onslow proclaimed himself a classic rightwinger. He specialised in aviation, rising to chairman of the Tory MPs' aviation committee, a position he used to defend the British Aircraft Corporation, which had a plant in his constituency. He blamed Harold Wilson's cancellation of the BAC TSR2 warplane on Labour's CND supporters and wore a black and yellow tie, the black mourning the TSR2's demise and the yellow standing for the government's lack of courage in the decision.</p> <p>Onslow supported hanging, attacked anti-Franco elements among Labour MPs, demanded reductions in third-world aid and tax cuts so the middle classes could send their children to fee-paying schools. He opposed televising the Commons. However, he showed a serious, nonpartisan interest in civil aviation when leading for the Tories in this field in 1968. After his party was returned to power, he held ministerial office under Michael Heseltine from 1972-74.</p> <p>In the subsequent years of opposition, he introduced a bill to give the vote to servicemen and their wives, and again urged cuts in overseas aid.

But if you want them, the opportunities for further training are there.\" Ms Murray has been an agency worker with Central Recruitment for three years, after a spell as a full-time carer in residential care. She is impressed with their seriousness, and willingness to deal with issues like poor practice on placements. \"They treat it as more than just a business. But agencies vary enormously in my experience, and many are not nearly as good. As an agency worker you're very vulnerable to dismissal; most are not in a union and you're not part of the supervision structure. Nor is there anything to stop someone signing up with two agencies, and working longer hours than they should.\" She also regrets the impact of the rapid turnover of staff on service users, particularly on extremely vulnerable groups such as people with autism. On the other hand, the recruitment crisis in social care means the problem is not just with agency workers. \"The rate of turnover of local authority staff is nearly as high. It's appalling the speed with which they appear and disappear.\"",

The signing of Mr Catchpole, who is regarded by many as the best TV critic in the industry, is a major coup for the Express under new owner Richard Desmond, who last week announced plans to axe 145 journalists. \"I was perfectly happy at the Mirror but this offer came out of the blue and I couldn't refuse it,\" said Mr Catchpole. \"It is a very good package. The Mirror made a counter offer and Piers has been very nice about it but in the end I decided with a heavy heart to go.\" He will join the paper in the same role as star TV critic. He will also continue his once-weekly column about sport on TV. Mr Catchpole joined the Mirror from the News of the World three years ago - one of editor Piers Morgan's first signings. His ruminations on television have brought him a well-deserved reputation as one of the nation's favourite critics. He displays the obligatory sarcasm where necessary, recently describing the axed ITV series Public Property as being so dull it \"made watching paint dry seem as exciting as white water rafting\". And last week he castigated Anthea Turner as being \"fragile... the way rhinos are thin-skinned\". But his observations can also combine generosity with wit. He noted of the departure of Chris Eubank from the Celebrity Big Brother house: \"Seeing a former championship boxer solemnly telling a member of an Irish boyband that 200 years ago, trousers were invented for the working class, and before then everyone wore dresses, is a moment of televisual history to cherish.\" But the signing, following shortly after the announcement of mass job cuts at the Express, is likely to fuel the wrath of journalists on the newspaper, who have been told their jobs are being axed to \"radically change the culture of newspapers\". Close friends say Mr Catchpole was unperturbed by the fact the Express had just launched a fierce cost-cutting drive. \"He is part of the rescue team. Newspapers' fortunes go up as well as down,\" said one. Mr Desmond's trategy has focused on bringing in named writers on high salaries - including former Sun sports writer Brian Woolnough and Celebrity Big Brother victim Vanessa Feltz - at the expense of a well-staffed newsdesk.

      "byline": "Libby Brooks",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Frederick Forsyth - conservative, traditionalist, and man of modest tastes - never profers a short answer where a lengthy anecdote will suffice. He is telling me about the previous night's episode of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. Which he watched alone with a tray supper because his wife can't stand the fug of his Rothmans. About how he thought (for \u00a3125,000) that the symbol on the national flag of India was a star. And about how the contestant went 50/50, then phoned a friend, who was actually his ex-wife, and it transpired that the correct answer was a wheel. </p> <p>My own suggestion (star) some time earlier is glossed over. He doesn't so much talk with as talk at: a pocket orator projecting - with authority - to the centre of his living room. He commands his facts like toy soldiers. </p> <p>Sixty-two-year-old Forsyth, notably one of Margaret Thatcher's favourite authors, is indeed a man of parts. At 19, he was the youngest pilot in the RAF. As a foreign correspondent for Reuters and then the BBC, he worked throughout Europe and Africa. For more than three decades, he crafted multi-million-selling thrillers, including The Odessa File, The Fourth Protocol and most famously The Day of the Jackal, that exemplary yarn centred on a plot to assassinate De Gaulle. More recently, he has enjoyed bucolic harmony as a gentleman farmer of a 140-acre plot in Hertfordshire (grazing sheep, thus far foot and mouth-free). </p> <p>But most notably of late, Forsyth has reinvented himself as a sayer of the unsayable. Anti-Euro, pro-hunting, elegant defender of all things rural, constitutional and consistent, he has become as ubiquitous as he is vocal. There has been tough talk in the Mail (\"[we have] quietly slid into elective dictatorship in which we are all treated with dismissive contempt\"), and robust jottings to the Telegraph letters page. His best work has been reserved for Radio Four's Saturday Essay, on which he alternates with Will Self. The switchboard nearly imploded when he offered, with deliciously voluptuous modulation, the simile \"like diarrhoea from a Zulu's bottom\". A stately shocker with impeccable manners and a gilded turn of phrase, he has not found himself short on commissions. </p> <p>He considers himself an activist on only four subjects: our constitution (\"one of the best in the world\"), parliamentary democracy (which Blair is treating \"with contempt\"), the countryside (ditto), and Europe (more anon).Inevitably, he applauds the clear vision, radicalism and ground-breaking contribution to the status of working women of Margaret Thatcher. </p> <p>This increased polemical visibility is in part a response to the Blair government, in part, he says, to the \"pandemic sense of helplessness\" he sees around him. People yearn for a time when standards were higher, and integrity greater. People don't feel they have a voice. And though he claims only to speak for himself, he suggests that his views do chime with \"perhaps 50%\" of the population. </p> <p>\"As I said on the Today programme the other day, I think the old left/right definitions don't apply much any more. There's a division, but it's not a vertical one, it's slantwise, and basically it's traditionalists against progressives. I'm a traditionalist, but so is most of left Labour. There's a strong vein of traditionalism within the working class, a strong vein of patriotism. And then of course one has the Blairite tendency, which basically says, 'Let's change it, and move to some utopian upland which we can see and if you buggers can't then screw you.' \" </p> <p>On the upland in question hovers the dark spectre of Europe - which he calls \"the European question\" because it has yet to be answered to his satisfaction. \"I'm a sceptic in the literal sense of the word - one who remains to be convinced. But the lingo becomes very tricky - [Labour thinks that] someone who doesn't believe is a xenophobe, a little Englander, or doesn't understand Europe. I speak five European languages and I've been to every country on the continent bar Liechtenstein. Anyway, you can't disapprove of Europe - it's a continent full of very nice people.\" </p> <p>His tendency towards the rabid is eclipsed by a boyish delight in establishing possible conspiracies. \"Either a tiny caucus knows exactly where they're going and won't divulge, or they're making it up on the hoof. I find it very difficult to believe that there is no masterplan,\" he intones with a treacly chuckle. </p> <p>Although keen to position himself as the anti-establishment irritant, Forsyth joined the Tory party in 1998, because \"I thought there ought to be an opposition in this country, and they needed a little help\". Now he gives talks to constituency parties in his area - \"within a 50-mile radius, I always specify that, or I'd spend my whole life motoring\" - and is a member of the Front Bench Club, paying \u00a31,000 a year for the privilege of occasional lunches with members of the shadow cabinet. (There is something corpulent and fleshy about the way he says \"lunch\". His delivery oozes patrician camp, and when he laughs he presses his lips into a fruity little pout.) </p> <p>\"William Hague is not a man I know well. I've never had a meal with him, never had a drink with him, so we nod and greet and I even get to give Ffion a peck on the cheek. He's not charismatic, but person to person he's highly intelligent, very humorous, self-deprecating, and I think he's got bottle. Blair is exactly the opposite, but boy can he project, like Clinton. </p> <p> \"Hague is always portrayed in the cartoons as somewhere between a baby and a gnome, but he's 5ft 10 1/2 in and rock-solid muscle. It's probably the round bullet head and having lost his hair too young - even though 10% of British males do.\" But does he have confidence in him as leader of the party? \"If there were a Churchill waiting in the wings, I'd say yes, we should have a leadership election. But to be perfectly honest there is nothing like Churchill waiting in the wings.\" </p> <p>Forsyth has not written a thriller for several years: \"I felt that the challenge and the adrenalin had gone. It was a chore - lucrative, but a chore.\" Fiction was never a creative compulsion. His regime - two or more years of research, two months of writing - reflects his treasure-hunt fascination with the world of spooks, spies and assassins. His plots - the disintegration of the USSR, black market arms dealing in East Germany, the Gulf war - have always honoured the real. Forsyth knew his stuff. </p> <p>\"Some said that I was a spook, but I just knew a few. I used to know the chiefs of the secret intelligence service in sequence from Maurice Oldfield onwards, but I have got out of touch.\" Was it exciting to be privy to insider knowledge? \"I don't think one gets intoxicated just because one is talking to a controller of the western hemisphere. They are human beings.\" </p> <p>Espionage is a British speciality and obsession, he says. \"I suspect because we're a bit secretive, matched probably by the Russians but not the Americans. It probably comes from the public school ethos: what is an old school tie but a secret recognition code?\" </p> <p>He has said that one of the reasons why he stopped writing thrillers was the modern absence of grand global themes. \"The twin themes that dominated the lives of all of us who are now about 60 were the nuclear threat and the cold war,\" he explains. \"We lived with it on a daily basis. The 'Ban the bomb' marches were far more passionate than [those about] fox hunting. Now we look for mini themes: Saddam Hussein, foxes.\" </p> <p>As he talks, his body remains still. His legs are outstretched and the bright brown leather of his shoes squeaks. He talks through the smoke, even when he has just inhaled. </p> <p>\"There was a clarity of loyalty, of interest, and one knew that what was at stake was unspeakable - it was the destruction of the planet. I miss the clarity. The world's now getting to a stage where everything is arguable, but all the issues are basically much smaller than whether the planet survives.\" </p> <p>Is he confounded by postmodernity, I joke. He doesn't respond lightly. \"Yes, without certain clarities life becomes a howling wilderness, where anyone can make their mind up as to whether Oasis are as good as Shakespeare.\" He attempts a laugh but it is rather sad. </p> <p>When I ask him how his politics have evolved over his lifetime he informs me that he has become more mellow and more tolerant. \"I was probably rather abrasive as a youngster.

      "bodyText": "Frederick Forsyth - conservative, traditionalist, and man of modest tastes - never profers a short answer where a lengthy anecdote will suffice. He is telling me about the previous night's episode of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. Which he watched alone with a tray supper because his wife can't stand the fug of his Rothmans. About how he thought (for \u00a3125,000) that the symbol on the national flag of India was a star. And about how the contestant went 50/50, then phoned a friend, who was actually his ex-wife, and it transpired that the correct answer was a wheel. My own suggestion (star) some time earlier is glossed over. He doesn't so much talk with as talk at: a pocket orator projecting - with authority - to the centre of his living room. He commands his facts like toy soldiers. Sixty-two-year-old Forsyth, notably one of Margaret Thatcher's favourite authors, is indeed a man of parts. At 19, he was the youngest pilot in the RAF. As a foreign correspondent for Reuters and then the BBC, he worked throughout Europe and Africa. For more than three decades, he crafted multi-million-selling thrillers, including The Odessa File, The Fourth Protocol and most famously The Day of the Jackal, that exemplary yarn centred on a plot to assassinate De Gaulle. More recently, he has enjoyed bucolic harmony as a gentleman farmer of a 140-acre plot in Hertfordshire (grazing sheep, thus far foot and mouth-free). But most notably of late, Forsyth has reinvented himself as a sayer of the unsayable. Anti-Euro, pro-hunting, elegant defender of all things rural, constitutional and consistent, he has become as ubiquitous as he is vocal. There has been tough talk in the Mail (\"[we have] quietly slid into elective dictatorship in which we are all treated with dismissive contempt\"), and robust jottings to the Telegraph letters page. His best work has been reserved for Radio Four's Saturday Essay, on which he alternates with Will Self. The switchboard nearly imploded when he offered, with deliciously voluptuous modulation, the simile \"like diarrhoea from a Zulu's bottom\". A stately shocker with impeccable manners and a gilded turn of phrase, he has not found himself short on commissions. He considers himself an activist on only four subjects: our constitution (\"one of the best in the world\"), parliamentary democracy (which Blair is treating \"with contempt\"), the countryside (ditto), and Europe (more anon).Inevitably, he applauds the clear vision, radicalism and ground-breaking contribution to the status of working women of Margaret Thatcher. This increased polemical visibility is in part a response to the Blair government, in part, he says, to the \"pandemic sense of helplessness\" he sees around him. People yearn for a time when standards were higher, and integrity greater. People don't feel they have a voice. And though he claims only to speak for himself, he suggests that his views do chime with \"perhaps 50%\" of the population. \"As I said on the Today programme the other day, I think the old left/right definitions don't apply much any more. There's a division, but it's not a vertical one, it's slantwise, and basically it's traditionalists against progressives. I'm a traditionalist, but so is most of left Labour. There's a strong vein of traditionalism within the working class, a strong vein of patriotism. And then of course one has the Blairite tendency, which basically says, 'Let's change it, and move to some utopian upland which we can see and if you buggers can't then screw you.' \" On the upland in question hovers the dark spectre of Europe - which he calls \"the European question\" because it has yet to be answered to his satisfaction. \"I'm a sceptic in the literal sense of the word - one who remains to be convinced. But the lingo becomes very tricky - [Labour thinks that] someone who doesn't believe is a xenophobe, a little Englander, or doesn't understand Europe. I speak five European languages and I've been to every country on the continent bar Liechtenstein. Anyway, you can't disapprove of Europe - it's a continent full of very nice people.\" His tendency towards the rabid is eclipsed by a boyish delight in establishing possible conspiracies. \"Either a tiny caucus knows exactly where they're going and won't divulge, or they're making it up on the hoof. I find it very difficult to believe that there is no masterplan,\" he intones with a treacly chuckle. Although keen to position himself as the anti-establishment irritant, Forsyth joined the Tory party in 1998, because \"I thought there ought to be an opposition in this country, and they needed a little help\". Now he gives talks to constituency parties in his area - \"within a 50-mile radius, I always specify that, or I'd spend my whole life motoring\" - and is a member of the Front Bench Club, paying \u00a31,000 a year for the privilege of occasional lunches with members of the shadow cabinet. (There is something corpulent and fleshy about the way he says \"lunch\". His delivery oozes patrician camp, and when he laughs he presses his lips into a fruity little pout.) \"William Hague is not a man I know well. I've never had a meal with him, never had a drink with him, so we nod and greet and I even get to give Ffion a peck on the cheek. He's not charismatic, but person to person he's highly intelligent, very humorous, self-deprecating, and I think he's got bottle. Blair is exactly the opposite, but boy can he project, like Clinton. \"Hague is always portrayed in the cartoons as somewhere between a baby and a gnome, but he's 5ft 10 1/2 in and rock-solid muscle. It's probably the round bullet head and having lost his hair too young - even though 10% of British males do.\" But does he have confidence in him as leader of the party? \"If there were a Churchill waiting in the wings, I'd say yes, we should have a leadership election. But to be perfectly honest there is nothing like Churchill waiting in the wings.\" Forsyth has not written a thriller for several years: \"I felt that the challenge and the adrenalin had gone. It was a chore - lucrative, but a chore.\" Fiction was never a creative compulsion. His regime - two or more years of research, two months of writing - reflects his treasure-hunt fascination with the world of spooks, spies and assassins. His plots - the disintegration of the USSR, black market arms dealing in East Germany, the Gulf war - have always honoured the real. Forsyth knew his stuff. \"Some said that I was a spook, but I just knew a few. I used to know the chiefs of the secret intelligence service in sequence from Maurice Oldfield onwards, but I have got out of touch.\" Was it exciting to be privy to insider knowledge? \"I don't think one gets intoxicated just because one is talking to a controller of the western hemisphere. They are human beings.\" Espionage is a British speciality and obsession, he says. \"I suspect because we're a bit secretive, matched probably by the Russians but not the Americans. It probably comes from the public school ethos: what is an old school tie but a secret recognition code?\" He has said that one of the reasons why he stopped writing thrillers was the modern absence of grand global themes. \"The twin themes that dominated the lives of all of us who are now about 60 were the nuclear threat and the cold war,\" he explains. \"We lived with it on a daily basis. The 'Ban the bomb' marches were far more passionate than [those about] fox hunting. Now we look for mini themes: Saddam Hussein, foxes.\" As he talks, his body remains still. His legs are outstretched and the bright brown leather of his shoes squeaks. He talks through the smoke, even when he has just inhaled. \"There was a clarity of loyalty, of interest, and one knew that what was at stake was unspeakable - it was the destruction of the planet. I miss the clarity. The world's now getting to a stage where everything is arguable, but all the issues are basically much smaller than whether the planet survives.\" Is he confounded by postmodernity, I joke. He doesn't respond lightly. \"Yes, without certain clarities life becomes a howling wilderness, where anyone can make their mind up as to whether Oasis are as good as Shakespeare.\" He attempts a laugh but it is rather sad. When I ask him how his politics have evolved over his lifetime he informs me that he has become more mellow and more tolerant. \"I was probably rather abrasive as a youngster. I was more simplistic then, thought I could change the world and this is how to do it, and after a while you realise it's not that easy.\" Was he a romantic? \"The heroes of my young days were the great victors like Marlborough and Wellington. The walls of my boyhood bedroom were decorated with fighter pilots, from the first and second world wars. One did think that ours was a bloody good country with a bloody good history. The self-flagellation hadn't started.\" For all the microfiche and macho posturing, wasn't it all rather innocent? \"If certainty is innocence and complexity is sophistication, yes it was. One was educated not to have doubts, and that wasn't just the middle class, that was all the country. Is it better to have doubts? Are we smarter?

      "body": "<p>There's a new buzzword in town and surprise surprise, it's one of those techie ones that only a handful of people will understand. It's drop-dialling and if you've never heard of it, don't worry, for until now the term was only really commonplace in porn circles.</p> <p>Given its background, it was only a matter of time before the less churlish broadcasters cottoned on to it, especially now that they're all falling over each other to make the web financially robust - and that's the impetus behind drop-dialling. Broadcasters need the web to start to work for them, but there are problems in making web programming pay. Basically, consumers are loath to tediously input credit card details in return for nothing more than a five-minute clip.</p> <p>But, as the porn industry has found, consumers are quite happy to cover the \"broadcast charges\" with a premium rate dial-up call if it means they get the clip without having to do anything. The theory is simple: the user clicks on the drop-dialler, it automatically disconnects the user's internet connection and then dials up to the new number, the clip is streamed, ends and the users are connected back to their own internet service. The user is happy; the broadcaster is happy; everyone is happy, especially the telephone company which takes a healthy chunk of the call cost. The benefits are there for all to see. All that broadcasters have to do is get together with one of the growing number of phone operators offering drop-dialling.</p> <p>Granada Broadband, the digital development division of Granada Media, has declared its interest in drop-dialling, along with the BBC and Channel 5, which have both conducted drop-dialling voting experiments.</p> <p>The BBC introduced drop-dialling to its Comic Relief Big Brother website (<a href=\"http://www.Comicrelief.com/bigbrother\" target=\"_NEW\">.Comicrelief.com/bigbrother</a>) last week, although the BBC would be the first to admit that, in its current form, drop-dialling leaves something to be desired. The drop-dialler used by Comic Relief to collect revenues from internet voters could not be used by Apple Mac users, nor could it be used by anyone not dialling up to the internet using a modem, given that it has to disconnect the line. Therein lies the flaw in the model. It cannot work with office-leased line connections and it cannot work with broadband. Instead it is limited to the estimated 7.8m home internet users who have narrowband connections. </p> <p>Even then, it remains debatable whether users will click on the button that says: \"When you vote online, your computer will simply stop the modem connection to your usual internet service provider and then reconnect you to the internet via a premium-rate line to register your vote.\" While it is a relatively painless process, and consumers have gradually accepted the concept of premium-rate phone lines (Who Wants to be a Millionaire? and Big Brother to take two phenomenally profitable examples), it is still easier to pick up a phone than log on to a website and sit and wait for the system to clock your vote. And that's even if you are already online and you are aware of the fixed price of the call - 25p in the case of Celebrity Big Brother. </p> <p>Audiocall, the BBC Worldwide-owned telephone operator behind the Celebrity Big Brother internet vote, counts Channel 4, Channel 5, BBC Broadcast, BBC Worldwide, ITV, digital and satellite channels and advertising agencies among its clients, but has so far only used drop-dialler voting for Comic Relief and Channel 5's 70s Weekend. </p> <p>For the 70s Weekend, viewers were given the option to vote for their favourite song from that decade via the broadcaster's website. Because it was the first time a British broadcaster had ever used Audiocall's drop-dialler, the response rates were understandably low and Audiocall is guarded about specific numbers. Likewise, the response rates to the Comic Relief drop-dialler have not yet been revealed. </p> <p>Justin Judd, controller of content and production for Granada Broadband, is optimistic about the potential of drop-dialling, though: \"It may not be the quickest and easiest way to vote in response to a TV programme prompt, but as an internet revenue model that doesn't involve security complications, it has possibilities.\"</p> <p>Judd is looking at different opportunities for using drop-diallers to serve broadcast content as a route into internet pay-per-view. \"What content we might end up using is still being tested, but it will have to have some scarcity value, not be any old stuff,\" he says. </p> <p>Just as broadcasters are assessing the potential of drop-dialling, so is the music industry. With MSN putting time and money into developing a website to stream concerts, it would not be surprising if MSNMusic.com introduced drop-diallers as an alternative to credit card subscriptions. </p> <p>One possibility for Granada, says Judd, is to stream exclusive clips from its shows such as Cold Feet and Coronation Street, with the cost perhaps set at 25p a minute for a 10-minute clip. At \u00a32.50 a pop per user, split between the operator and the broadcaster, it starts to look like an alternative way of making money from the internet if a few thousand people can be persuaded to download it. This is made even more attractive when the context of the crestfallen internet advertising market is taken into account. No website, it seems, is pulling in satisfactory ad revenues. </p> <p>\"We're all worried about making money from the internet, and making our core business - content - pay online,\" adds Judd. \"The adult industry has demonstrated it does work but it all depends on whether the user wants the content.\"</p> <p>Riccardo Donato, general manager of Audiocall, agrees: \"The original model was for content and was used for law reports and adult stuff, but now everyone is looking at broadcast quality pay-per-view on the internet, it becomes an easy way for broadcasters to get viewers to pay for quality content.\" But Donato thinks the most popular application for drop-dialling will be voting, as consumers are increasingly inclined to accept the cost of a phone call if they feel they can have their say. For an indicator of this, one only has to look at the number of people who called in to vote for the Big Brother evictions last year. Some 20m phone calls were made in all, bringing in revenues of around \u00a32m. </p> <p>No doubt Big Brother 2 will be looking at incorporating a drop-dialler into its website for voting and maybe even for eagerly sought-after clips if the contestants can be coaxed into more outrageous behaviour. In the meantime, expect to see many more websites using drop-diallers over the next 12 months. </p> <p>Perhaps they could go some way to solving the unsettling revenue crisis the web is currently in, or perhaps they will just be an interim measure until the sensational world of broadband comes along. Whatever it may be, at least it's an alternative revenue model, and that has to be a good thing in the current climate.</p>",

The theory is simple: the user clicks on the drop-dialler, it automatically disconnects the user's internet connection and then dials up to the new number, the clip is streamed, ends and the users are connected back to their own internet service. The user is happy; the broadcaster is happy; everyone is happy, especially the telephone company which takes a healthy chunk of the call cost. The benefits are there for all to see. All that broadcasters have to do is get together with one of the growing number of phone operators offering drop-dialling. Granada Broadband, the digital development division of Granada Media, has declared its interest in drop-dialling, along with the BBC and Channel 5, which have both conducted drop-dialling voting experiments. The BBC introduced drop-dialling to its Comic Relief Big Brother website (.Comicrelief.com/bigbrother) last week, although the BBC would be the first to admit that, in its current form, drop-dialling leaves something to be desired. The drop-dialler used by Comic Relief to collect revenues from internet voters could not be used by Apple Mac users, nor could it be used by anyone not dialling up to the internet using a modem, given that it has to disconnect the line. Therein lies the flaw in the model. It cannot work with office-leased line connections and it cannot work with broadband. Instead it is limited to the estimated 7.8m home internet users who have narrowband connections. Even then, it remains debatable whether users will click on the button that says: \"When you vote online, your computer will simply stop the modem connection to your usual internet service provider and then reconnect you to the internet via a premium-rate line to register your vote.\" While it is a relatively painless process, and consumers have gradually accepted the concept of premium-rate phone lines (Who Wants to be a Millionaire? and Big Brother to take two phenomenally profitable examples), it is still easier to pick up a phone than log on to a website and sit and wait for the system to clock your vote. And that's even if you are already online and you are aware of the fixed price of the call - 25p in the case of Celebrity Big Brother. Audiocall, the BBC Worldwide-owned telephone operator behind the Celebrity Big Brother internet vote, counts Channel 4, Channel 5, BBC Broadcast, BBC Worldwide, ITV, digital and satellite channels and advertising agencies among its clients, but has so far only used drop-dialler voting for Comic Relief and Channel 5's 70s Weekend. For the 70s Weekend, viewers were given the option to vote for their favourite song from that decade via the broadcaster's website. Because it was the first time a British broadcaster had ever used Audiocall's drop-dialler, the response rates were understandably low and Audiocall is guarded about specific numbers. Likewise, the response rates to the Comic Relief drop-dialler have not yet been revealed. Justin Judd, controller of content and production for Granada Broadband, is optimistic about the potential of drop-dialling, though: \"It may not be the quickest and easiest way to vote in response to a TV programme prompt, but as an internet revenue model that doesn't involve security complications, it has possibilities.\" Judd is looking at different opportunities for using drop-diallers to serve broadcast content as a route into internet pay-per-view. \"What content we might end up using is still being tested, but it will have to have some scarcity value, not be any old stuff,\" he says. Just as broadcasters are assessing the potential of drop-dialling, so is the music industry. With MSN putting time and money into developing a website to stream concerts, it would not be surprising if MSNMusic.com introduced drop-diallers as an alternative to credit card subscriptions. One possibility for Granada, says Judd, is to stream exclusive clips from its shows such as Cold Feet and Coronation Street, with the cost perhaps set at 25p a minute for a 10-minute clip. At \u00a32.50 a pop per user, split between the operator and the broadcaster, it starts to look like an alternative way of making money from the internet if a few thousand people can be persuaded to download it. This is made even more attractive when the context of the crestfallen internet advertising market is taken into account. No website, it seems, is pulling in satisfactory ad revenues. \"We're all worried about making money from the internet, and making our core business - content - pay online,\" adds Judd. \"The adult industry has demonstrated it does work but it all depends on whether the user wants the content.\" Riccardo Donato, general manager of Audiocall, agrees: \"The original model was for content and was used for law reports and adult stuff, but now everyone is looking at broadcast quality pay-per-view on the internet, it becomes an easy way for broadcasters to get viewers to pay for quality content.\" But Donato thinks the most popular application for drop-dialling will be voting, as consumers are increasingly inclined to accept the cost of a phone call if they feel they can have their say. For an indicator of this, one only has to look at the number of people who called in to vote for the Big Brother evictions last year. Some 20m phone calls were made in all, bringing in revenues of around \u00a32m. No doubt Big Brother 2 will be looking at incorporating a drop-dialler into its website for voting and maybe even for eagerly sought-after clips if the contestants can be coaxed into more outrageous behaviour. In the meantime, expect to see many more websites using drop-diallers over the next 12 months. Perhaps they could go some way to solving the unsettling revenue crisis the web is currently in, or perhaps they will just be an interim measure until the sensational world of broadband comes along. Whatever it may be, at least it's an alternative revenue model, and that has to be a good thing in the current climate.",

I have nothing against Tottenham, but I am not planning to coach in England or abroad. I want to work in Italy, and I am awaiting concrete offers.\" Bobby Robson will add to the signing of Bradford defender Andy O'Brien by making a \u00a37m move to bring Michael Bridges back to the North East, according to the Daily Star. The Newcastle manager may not attempt to sign the Leeds man until the summer however. Teamtalk are tipping Mark Kennedy for a pre-transfer deadline move from Man City to Ipswich. They claim the Republic of Ireland winger has not been enjoying himself at Maine Road recently, and could leave the club for \u00a31.5m. Arsenal are interested in young Cologne striker Christian Timm. A regular in the German Under-21 side, Timm would come with a \u00a33m pricetag, according to the Daily Star. Steve Coppell is in the running for the Tranmere job after John Aldridge resigned at the weekend, say the Daily Express.",

      "body": "<p>If war is, as Clausewitz said, the continuation of politics by other means, then a war correspondent is a political reporter in another context. The old adage needs to be remembered with special urgency when fighting breaks out in the Balkans. Precisely because they are part of Europe, the temptation for non-Balkan Europeans in the more prosperous part of the continent to demonise their southern neighbours seems to be huge.</p> <p>The crisis in Macedonia is the latest case. Too many politicians, analysts and journalists are already using the apocalyptic language of \"conflagration\", \"rivers of blood\", and \"regional war\" or commenting, as the Sunday Telegraph did yesterday, \"After Bosnia, after Kosovo, one would have thought the people of the Balkans had had enough of killing each other.\"</p> <p>The Balkans have certainly had a miserable decade with an appalling record of massacre and ethnic cleansing. But the latest events in Macedonia provide no reason to abandon normal political analysis in favour of a gloomy determinism which assumes that every Balkan conflict is about ethnicity, and that once tapped lightly on the shoulder, the ethnic genie will always race off to mass murder. The Sunday Telegraph should note there have only been two deaths in the \"conflagration\" around Tetovo. An army pilot died when a helicopter hit a power line. An Albanian civilian was killed by a stray bullet.</p> <p>More significantly, the clashes are not just a dispute between Albanians and Macedonians. They are also a dispute among Albanians. The established Albanian politicians of Macedonia, as well as those of Kosovo and Albania itself, have all condemned the gunmen. The Macedonian government, a coalition of Macedonian and Albanian parties, has not fallen. Indeed, apart from four Albanian and two Macedonian MPs, the entire parliament condemned the \"armed groups of extremists\" yesterday and called for foreign military help. The motion was supported not only by the Albanian party in government but also by the Albanian opposition Party of Democratic Prosperity.</p> <p>So the gunmen operating in the hills above Tetovo represent a minority. That said, it does not follow that a large number of Macedonia's Albanians do not support their goals, as opposed to their violent methods. Before and since independence in 1991 Albanians have regularly criticised the lack of language rights for their community and discrimination in public service jobs. There have been frequent outbursts of nationalism with demands for the right to fly the Albanian flag. Arben Xhaferi, now the leading Albanian moderate in Macedonia, is a jail veteran from flag protests going back as far as 1968.</p> <p>Calls for federalisation within Macedonia, which the gunmen seem to be making, have long been canvassed by some Albanians though always rejected by Macedonian politicians on the grounds they would be the first step to secession.</p> <p>If the gunmen are to remain isolated, a heavy responsibility now rests on the local politicians of both sides as well as, to a lesser extent, on western governments. The Albanian leaders in Macedonia and in Kosovo must go beyond their public condemnations of the gunmen and start serious discussions with them and their leaders for a ceasefire. The gunmen have made a point but they must now leave room for political talks by elected leaders to go forward.</p> <p>By the same token, the Macedonian military and police must avoid any escalation. It is clear that Nato is not going to get involved with troops, beyond a belated tightening up of security on the border between Kosovo and Macedonia. It is also apparent that the Macedonian security forces do not have the men, the equipment, or the sophisticated training to take the gunmen on by themselves. Blasting mortar rounds into forested hillsides serves little purpose other than as a temporary, though spurious, morale-booster for Macedonia's Slav majority. But it carries the risk of civilian casualties which would only serve to radicalise a wider segment of the Albanian population. The Macedonian military must avoid the use of excessive force which the Serbs wielded in Kosovo in 1998, turning the whole Albanian community against them.</p> <p>If a ceasefire can be achieved quickly, then all sides must be ready for wide-ranging talks and reasonable concessions. A decade after its hasty and unprepared independence, Macedonia needs to take a deep breath and work out a new dispensation. Albanian leaders must make an unequivocal declaration that they do not want to split the state. They must also renounce federalisation, at least for a 10-year period, in return for progress in opening public service jobs to Albanians. The constitution needs to enshrine multiracialism instead of its current assumption of Slav supremacy. Albanian must be recognised as an official language for parliament, the courts and public service. A minority as large as a third of the population, as the Albanians are thought to be, deserve no less. With common sense in Macedonia, and less hysteria outside it, solutions can be found.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jonathan.steele@theguardian.com\">jonathan.steele@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "If war is, as Clausewitz said, the continuation of politics by other means, then a war correspondent is a political reporter in another context. The old adage needs to be remembered with special urgency when fighting breaks out in the Balkans. Precisely because they are part of Europe, the temptation for non-Balkan Europeans in the more prosperous part of the continent to demonise their southern neighbours seems to be huge. The crisis in Macedonia is the latest case. Too many politicians, analysts and journalists are already using the apocalyptic language of \"conflagration\", \"rivers of blood\", and \"regional war\" or commenting, as the Sunday Telegraph did yesterday, \"After Bosnia, after Kosovo, one would have thought the people of the Balkans had had enough of killing each other.\" The Balkans have certainly had a miserable decade with an appalling record of massacre and ethnic cleansing. But the latest events in Macedonia provide no reason to abandon normal political analysis in favour of a gloomy determinism which assumes that every Balkan conflict is about ethnicity, and that once tapped lightly on the shoulder, the ethnic genie will always race off to mass murder. The Sunday Telegraph should note there have only been two deaths in the \"conflagration\" around Tetovo. An army pilot died when a helicopter hit a power line. An Albanian civilian was killed by a stray bullet. More significantly, the clashes are not just a dispute between Albanians and Macedonians. They are also a dispute among Albanians. The established Albanian politicians of Macedonia, as well as those of Kosovo and Albania itself, have all condemned the gunmen. The Macedonian government, a coalition of Macedonian and Albanian parties, has not fallen. Indeed, apart from four Albanian and two Macedonian MPs, the entire parliament condemned the \"armed groups of extremists\" yesterday and called for foreign military help. The motion was supported not only by the Albanian party in government but also by the Albanian opposition Party of Democratic Prosperity. So the gunmen operating in the hills above Tetovo represent a minority. That said, it does not follow that a large number of Macedonia's Albanians do not support their goals, as opposed to their violent methods. Before and since independence in 1991 Albanians have regularly criticised the lack of language rights for their community and discrimination in public service jobs. There have been frequent outbursts of nationalism with demands for the right to fly the Albanian flag. Arben Xhaferi, now the leading Albanian moderate in Macedonia, is a jail veteran from flag protests going back as far as 1968. Calls for federalisation within Macedonia, which the gunmen seem to be making, have long been canvassed by some Albanians though always rejected by Macedonian politicians on the grounds they would be the first step to secession. If the gunmen are to remain isolated, a heavy responsibility now rests on the local politicians of both sides as well as, to a lesser extent, on western governments. The Albanian leaders in Macedonia and in Kosovo must go beyond their public condemnations of the gunmen and start serious discussions with them and their leaders for a ceasefire. The gunmen have made a point but they must now leave room for political talks by elected leaders to go forward. By the same token, the Macedonian military and police must avoid any escalation. It is clear that Nato is not going to get involved with troops, beyond a belated tightening up of security on the border between Kosovo and Macedonia. It is also apparent that the Macedonian security forces do not have the men, the equipment, or the sophisticated training to take the gunmen on by themselves. Blasting mortar rounds into forested hillsides serves little purpose other than as a temporary, though spurious, morale-booster for Macedonia's Slav majority. But it carries the risk of civilian casualties which would only serve to radicalise a wider segment of the Albanian population. The Macedonian military must avoid the use of excessive force which the Serbs wielded in Kosovo in 1998, turning the whole Albanian community against them. If a ceasefire can be achieved quickly, then all sides must be ready for wide-ranging talks and reasonable concessions. A decade after its hasty and unprepared independence, Macedonia needs to take a deep breath and work out a new dispensation. Albanian leaders must make an unequivocal declaration that they do not want to split the state. They must also renounce federalisation, at least for a 10-year period, in return for progress in opening public service jobs to Albanians. The constitution needs to enshrine multiracialism instead of its current assumption of Slav supremacy. Albanian must be recognised as an official language for parliament, the courts and public service. A minority as large as a third of the population, as the Albanians are thought to be, deserve no less. With common sense in Macedonia, and less hysteria outside it, solutions can be found. jonathan.steele@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p>Like his predecessor as chief executive of what is now Trinity Mirror newspapers, Philip Graf is an Ulsterman. But this particular Northern Irishman is not only ready to laugh, with what appears to be genuine spontaneity, at the slightest provocation, but is affable and self-effacing. Any resemblance between Philip Graf and David Montgomery, whom Graf succeeded in the Canary Wharf hot seat, is entirely implausible. </p> <p>When the skeletal, domineering Montgomery smiles, one can almost hear ice splintering. But jollity and the lack of it is just one of the many differences between the two men. Whereas it is a fair bet that if one were to mention the name of Montgomery to all those who have had dealings with him, a considerable proportion would spit venom, it is rare to find anyone with a bad word to say about Philip Graf. I did meet someone who was sniffy about the chief executive\u00eas skills in maintaining a healthy share price for Trinity, and forecast that he would be collecting his P45 inside six months. But as this came from a former Trinity Mirror employee, it would be unwise to give his prediction too much credence. The much-liked Graf is also, infuriatingly, too intrinsically nice a man to be nasty about anyone, even his predecessor. </p> <p>The popular version of events after Trinity, a powerful regional newspaper company, came courting Mirror Group, a bruised old lady who had seen better days, was that the presence of Montgomery was considered by the swain as an impediment to the match. Mirror shareholders, poised to deck themselves out in wedding finery, were not best pleased with the chief executive; neither was the Mirror board. Exit Montgomery, trundling a wheelbarrow full of compensation and share options, thus allowing, once the deliberations of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission had been concluded, the ceremony to take place.</p> <p>I suggested to Graf that had Montgomery not departed, the brakes would have been applied to Trinity\u00eas pursuit of Mirror Group. Mr Graf, most politely, hummed and hawed. \"Who knows?\" he replied. \"It depends on whether we could have worked out a proper board or management structure for the company. That had to be sorted out\u00c4\" But was Montgomery unacceptable to Trinity? \"If it couldn\u00eat have been sorted out, leaving personalities aside, then the deal wouldn\u00eat have happened.\" So Montgomery was unacceptable? \"Trinity felt that it was the right thing for someone from Trinity, myself, to be chief executive. There couldn\u00eat be two chief executives and there couldn\u00eat be any dubiety about what that role was.\" Rarely has a bridegroom been so chivalrous about the cad who once defiled his love. </p> <p>Graf is painstakingly careful when replying to any question. Had I asked him whether or not the weather was inclement, I suspect he would have spent considerable time at the window, or even out in the street with his eyes gazing skywards, before replying. During our second meeting, Graf told me how as a pre-university student he had lived for a year in California. This was at the time when the civil rights movement had begun inexorably to roll, the Vietnam war had not long begun and the unrest at Berkeley was about to explode with student protests. The experience changed his outlook on life, he told me.</p> <p>\"The civil rights movement helped me understand what was happening in Northern Ireland. It made me much more aware of what Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom was about. It also probably helped me to get on with a much wider range of people \u0086 it made me feel much more comfortable in dealing with people, whoever they were.\" So, I asked, did it make you more liberal? Graf responded with peals of laughter. \"I think it reinforced a lot of my views. The word liberal is capable of a number of definitions,\" he said, measuredly. \"It was\u00c4 interesting.\"</p> <p><strong>Minefield</strong><br> Graf never shirks answering a question but the minefield through which he appears to think he is tiptoeing when being interviewed gets even more fraught when Piers Morgan\u00eas propensity for headline-making as opposed to headline-writing and the City Slickers are discussed. Asked if he was concerned about the DTI investigation into the shares affair, Graf said: \"I don\u00eat believe they will find anything untoward. If they do, we\u00eall have to review the situation, but I really don\u00eat think they will find anything as far as Piers is concerned. It was a very difficult time and a very thorough [in-house] investigation was done.</p> <p>\"There was an awful lot of, I have to say, ill-informed and malicious journalism about Piers, about the company, about quite a number of people. And I don\u00eat mean just the Sun stuff, which was not unexpected. The vast majority of was completely unbelievable. I found it amazing, quite honestly, how people would take a rumour and print it as fact without checking it, without understanding the implications of it. The single thing I found most disappointing about the standard of newspapers since I have been in this job was the way that was dealt with. It is not so much that we were attacked, although of course I didn\u00eat like that. The real issue is what it is doing to readers when papers operate to those standards and use their own agenda to write stuff.</p> <p>\"Had our investigation shown Piers had done something wrong, that would have been different. But he hadn\u00eat. I think the PCC was very clear about what he did, which was ill judged [the PCC found Morgan had \u0095fallen short of the high professional standards\u00ea demanded by its code]. The matter was actually dealt with very quickly, before that report came out. The Slickers [Anil Bhoyrul and James Hipwell] went through a proper, careful disciplinary procedure in which I was not involved and were fired. As far as I am concerned, the issue has been dealt with, unless something remarkable, unexpected and new emerges.\"</p> <p>But what of the internal emails published by the Sunday Times, with the paper suggesting that they indicated the editor should have been aware the Slickers would be recommending Viglen shares the morning after he bought them? These emails had not, apparently, been disclosed to the PCC. Surely this was damaging for Morgan and the company?</p> <p>\"I am not trying to avoid the question,\" said Graf after a pause. \"No, the email was not shown to the PCC. There was quite confidential information in the investigation we conducted. It\u00eas a perfectly reasonable question, I\u00eam just trying to remember so that I don\u00eat mislead you... The PCC was not investigating the company. It was Piers Morgan who gave evidence to the PCC, not the company, so we didn\u00eat show them any documents.\" What\u00eas normal with such inquiries is to give the PCC an analysis of events and that\u00eas what we did.\"</p> <p>And the email in which Morgan referred to a discussion he had with Bhoyrul on \"Viglen day\" about the merits of the editor selling other shares in order to buy Viglen - Morgan, good naturedly it seemed, called Bhoyrul a \"halfwit\" in the email. Was it conceivable that such a conversation could have taken place without the following morning\u00eas pro-Viglen story being mentioned? At best, this was stunning incompetence; at worst, malpractice.</p> <p> \"It\u00eas a perfectly fair question and I am being very careful how I answer it so that I don\u00eat mislead you,\" Graf repeated. \"On the face of it, it is a perfectly fair point\u00c4\" The matter was, he explained, not at the forefront of his thinking at that moment \u0086 itself perfectly fair considering how much time had elapsed since the publicity surrounding the emails \u0086 and he obtained information from those who conducted the internal investigation before replying: \"We have never denied that they [Morgan and Bhoyrul] had spoken about Viglen, but that email does not show that they talked about Viglen that day. It had appeared in the City Slickers column on several occasions, remember.\"</p> <p>The whole affair is as clear as a murky pond and seems to become more impenetrable the more questions one asks. I did, however, ask one more. Another email revealed, as the Sunday Times put it, Morgan\u00eas appetite for investment and the occasional free gift (he allegedly purloined from Bhoyrul a Psion Revo personal organiser given to the Slicker at a launch party). Does not this not indicate embarrassing greed on the part of the editor of the group\u00eas flagship title? </p> <p>\"If you are saying, was it a desire to make lots of money and to exploit his position to make lots of money? Well, I stand by the fact that I don\u00eat think that\u00eas what he was about. I think he was foolish. I think the pattern of behaviour was a foolish pattern, not a greedy pattern.\" He will, added Graf, be glad when the matter is \"finally sorted, which I think it can be and will be\". The only child of a Belfast bakery foreman of German extraction, Philip Graf was educated at Methodist College, Belfast, and then Clare College, Cambridge, where he read law. The Belfast Telegraph came into the family home every day. and in the early 1960s the young Graf \u0086 he is now 54 \u0086 developed a passion for newspapers in general, but the Telegraph in particular, as the political and social changes in the province began to make headlines daily. At Cambridge, he worked on Varsity, briefly as sports editor and then as business manager \u0086 \"So I had early experience of signing people\u00eas expenses!\" After university, he got his opportunity in the newspaper industry with Thomson Regional Newspapers in London, working in marketing, advertising and research before returning to Belfast and the Thomson-owned Telegraph, where he became group circulation and marketing controller (he was \"pretty cross\" when, two decades later, the Monopolies Commission forced Trinity-Mirror to sell it after the merger) . His love affair with the paper was to continue, off and on, until it became a casualty of the Trinity-Mirror merger, the Monopolies Commission deciding that the combined group must shed the title to stay within regulatory limits.</p> <p><strong>Disappointing</strong><br></p> <p>Graf was not best pleased at this: \"Having to sell the Telegraph was one of the most disappointing things that has ever happened to me. I was pretty cross about it. We still have the Derry Journal and the Newsletter in Belfast, and I am very pleased about that, but to end my long association with the Telegraph was very disappointing.\"</p> <p>On his way up the managerial ladder he worked in circulation, marketing, market research and promotions. During the early days of bingo in newspapers, he recalls, his legal background came in useful and \"for a brief period I was one of the few people in the country who actually understood the gaming laws as they applied to bingo\". He next joined Trinity in Liverpool, becoming an assistant managing director of the Liverpool Post and Echo in 1984, a member of the Trinity board in 1987 and rising to become its chief executive in 1993. The acquisition of the Thomson group in 1995 moved Trinity into the big league. </p> <p>Graf recalls: \"it was then that we looked at how we were going to move on. It was clear company policy that we would go beyond regional newspapers, but where we would go was a question we constantly worked at. [Then] It became clear the Mirror was a possibility.\" In what to some City observers seemed an audacious move \u0086 MGN was much the bigger of the two companies \u0086 was, confesses Graf, fraught with problems: \"It was hard, looking back, but I think there were times when we doubted it would ever happen.\" Trinity edged out Regional Independent Media and captured Mirror Group for \u00a31.24bn. With Montgomery gone and while the Monopolies Commission brooded, MGN\u00eas John Allwood, who was to become Graf\u00eas deputy under the chairmanship of the already incumbent Sir Victor Blank, began to rationalise the group, a policy Graf continued when he arrived. </p> <p>Among the early casualties of the Trinity regime was Live TV, the machinations around which had over recent years proved far more entertaining than anything shown on screen. But, typically, Graf refuses to be too horrid about Janet Street-Porter, Kelvin MacKenzie and topless darts/Janet Street-Porter battleground that bred topless darts and chaos and helped fill gossip and media columns and an entire book: \"Live TV had\u00c4 how can I put it?\u00c4 an interesting history,\" said the chief executive. \"As a brand it had become damaged, and damaged beyond repair, but I wouldn\u00eat criticise people for having a go at doing what they tried to do. It was unfortunate the way it turned out. What it became was a bit of a laughing stock, which is unfair in many ways because it had some very good people and some very good ideas.\" Bearing in mind that all most people can remember about Live is MacKenzie\u00eas efforts to bring page three culture to television, Graf is again being charitable. With Graf, the \"No more nice guy\" reputation of most media moguls is translated to \"Lots more nice guy\" with Graf. The national newspapers were in \"pretty reasonable shape\" when he arrived, he recalls. \"There were some issues in Birmingham that we had to sort out [Trinity discovered circulation figures at the Post, Evening Mail and Sunday Mercury had been fraudulently enhanced over a long period], but morale was good and there was an underlying sense of confidence \"But I felt all along that I wasn\u00eat coming here to be the manager of national newspapers, but to run a group, and clearly there are differences [between national and provincial papers] \u0086 there is a different competitive dynamic, a different dynamic in circulation versus advertising, a different dynamic in terms of the profile the papers have.\" I set out to meet people, to listen to people, to understand people and deal with them fairly and rationally. I believe people respect that.\" Radical changes in the management structure, which include Joe Sinyor taking over as chief executive (newspapers) have freed Graf to concentrate on a more overall view of the business.</p> <p> There was much inference at the time, I reminded him, that Trinity would, as a provincial company, struggle to manage the cosmopolitan colossus created by the merger and, also, speculation that they would sell on the national newspapers. Graf chuckled at this: \"Inferred? It was said, not inferred \u0086 you\u00eare being very polite about it. As I said at the time, the difficulty for me was getting the straw out of my hair and clearing the pigs out of the kitchen in the morning before I read that stuff. It was inevitable, understandable, perhaps, because the Mirror was a bigger company in capitalisation terms \u0086 I suppose people thought the way the transaction took place, in terms of history, was not that usual. </p> <p>\"Selling on the national titles was never part of the game plan. Trinity felt the national titles were an important complement to the regional titles and the opportunity was there to see them develop together. I know there was an awful lot of talk at the time about that and it was partly encouraged by people who chose not to understand what we were trying to do. But here [at Canary Wharf] I found a good bunch of people wanting to take the business forward and realising that putting two businesses of this size and scale together is not easy, particularly if you are newspaper companies, where you are more in the public eye than if you were a widget company.</p> <p><strong>Progress</strong><br></p> <p>\"I think we\u00eave done pretty well, but we know we\u00eave got to do better. \"If you look at it from a financial perspective,\" Since the deal in 1999, he says, \"from a financial perspective we\u00eave delivered the numbers we said we would deliver. In terms of taking the business forward, we\u00eave made good progress, but not enough. We are looking to step up our pace there. At the minute, Trinity Mirror is the leading regional publisher, which is very nice. But the issue is not whether you are number one or number two in terms of circulation, but whether you\u00eave actually got the right business and a good business, with good newspapers at its heart. Now we want to continue to develop our existing newspapers, but also look at how we can move the business by acquisition.\" (And by recently acquiring the Southnews papers for \u00a3284.6m, Trinity Mirror boosted the titles under Graf\u00eas control to 260). It is a tough challenge, because prices are high and the world is changing and there are some big players around the place. But there are still opportunities in regional newspapers for us to look at and we\u00eall continue to do that.\" </p> <p>(They did, too: shortly after our first conversation. And, indeed, Trinity Mirror has recently acquired the 84 free and paid-for titles of the southeast regional group, Southnews, for \u00a3284.6m. This brings the number of newspapers and magazine titles under Graf\u00eas control to 260.)</p> <p>Might Trinity Mirror be interested in acquiring more national papers, I wondered? \"I think that is very unlikely,\" said Graf. I returned to the subject when we met for a second time, shortly after Richard Desmond had acquired the Express group. Was Trinity not tempted to enter the bidding for the Express, especially as the Daily Star and Sunday People would have made comfy bedfellows? \"No. We felt that to make a success of it in its particular competitive environment is always going to take a lot of money and effort. It just looked as if to develop any of the titles sensibly, you were going to have to spend quite a lot of money on them. I mean, there is no point in buying newspapers like that and saying, \u0095Right, we\u00eall buy them and just run them into the ground\u00ea.\" Does this mean Richard Desmond may have bitten off more than he possibly can chew? \"I am sure he has thought about that very carefully,\" said Graf, very carefully. \"He has certainly taken on a very formidable competitor in the DMGT [Daily Mail and General Trust]. They haven\u00eat messed about, have they?\"</p> <p>Soon after taking over the Express group, Desmond has mentioned that he might launch a Sunday version of the Daily Star. David Sullivan, proprietor of Sunday Sport, had made similar noises about a new Sunday tabloid. The last thing Trinity Mirror needs, I suggested, were further challengers in a fiercely competitive national Sunday market, where the Sunday People and, to a lesser extent, the Sunday Mirror, trail further and further behind in the wake of the News of the World. </p> <p> \"If and when that situation arises we shall have to react appropriately,\" said Graf, \"but there is no indication it is imminent.\" Earlier he had told me: \"I think all established media are in some sort of slight decline. Look at radio, look at television. But we still remain a very powerful mass media. \"The Sunday market is tough and I am not going to sit here and pretend I\u00eave got a solution for it. Social changes have transformed the British Sunday and made life tougher for, in particular, the Sunday red-tops. I think the Sunday Mirror has done well for us over the last couple of years. The Sunday People is a tougher challenge. Its rate of decline has slowed, but we\u00eave got to keep working at it.\" </p> <p> Does this mean the Sunday People makes a profit? \"Oh, absolutely. But nobody here underestimates the week-to-week challenge it has. Its rate of decline has slowed, but we\u00eave got to keep working at it.\" Would he, I ask, contemplate selling the Sunday People if the decline continued? \"I don\u00eat like selling titles.\" Or close it? \"At this stage, I see no reason to do either.\"</p> <p>When I first met Graf, the ABC circulation figures for all three titles were disappointing and there was an even gloomier report from the National Readership Survey, showing a sharp drop for the Mirror and only a minor one for the Sun. \"It\u00eas the fundamental ABC performance of the paper over a certain amount of time that concerns me, \" he said, \"and I am very happy with what the Mirror has done in that respect.\" (The latest figures make unhappy reading for him, though: in February it was showing a 3.25% year-on-year decline).</p> <p>Nevertheless, 16 months down the road the CEO is not dissatisfied. It has, however, been a bumpy journey, with Morgan coming perilously close to tumbling down a pothole and both Daily Record editor Martin and Trinity Mirror\u00eas managing director of national titles Roger Eastoe falling by the wayside somewhat abruptly. It was the wish of Eastoe, a long-time Mirror servant who had rubbed along with a succession of Mirror overlords, including Robert Maxwell, like a faithful sheepdog, to leave the group, insisted Graf.</p> <p>\"We needed to change the way the company was organised, to take the business forward, and Roger felt he would rather leave the company than take a role in that change.\" Three new senior managers \u0086 a chief executive of the company\u00eas newspapers and two managing directors, one for the regionals, another for the national titles \u0086 are now in place. </p> <p><strong>Attacks</strong><br></p> <p>Graf is far less forthcoming about reputed hard man Martin Clarke, who left the editorship of the Daily Record after his public admonishment of deputy sports editor Alan Rowan resulted in the resignation of several members of the sports department. Apart from insisting that Clarke\u00eas departure was unconnected with this particular incident \u0086 the word at Canary Wharf is that Clarke\u00eas attacks on ailing Scottish first minister Donald Dewar and general rightwing political stance alienated him from Trinity\u00eas top management \u0086 Graf will say only: \"I\u00eam unwilling to discuss the departure of Martin Clarke. As far as we are concerned, he resigned.\"</p> <p>When I first spoke with Graf, the circulation figures for all three titles were . \"We are slightly at a loss to understand what has happened to the readers per copy issue and we have been talking to the NRS about it,\" Graf confessed. \"It is not because all of a sudden we have lots of bulk sales. Frankly, I don\u00eat have a straightforward answer to it, but it is the fundamental ABC performance of the paper over a certain amount of time that concerns me and I am very happy with what the Mirror has done in that respect.\" </p> <p>(The latest circulation figures for the paper, however, make unhappy reading for all at Trinity Mirror: in February it was showing a 3.25 per cent year-on-year decline \u0086 far greater if bulk sales are discounted \u0086 against a year-on-year increase of almost 1%, and an even greater bulk-excluded figure, for the Sun.)</p> <p>At our second meeting, I discussed with Graf the difficulties facing the industry, especially its red-top titles, and asked if added value was the only way to slow, if not prevent, decline. \"I think there is a limit [to added value],\" he said, \"and some of the papers at the weekend must be getting very close to that limit, if they are not already at it, from the point of view of the reader. The extra challenge we have got is that newsprint prices are going up this year for the first time in a number of years and they are going to go up in double digits. That\u00eas a significant challenge for all of us, as to how we deal with it.</p> <p>\"Historically, newspapers\u00ea reactions to newsprint prices going up was a very simple one \u0086 to put the price up and cut the value. And then wonder why the readers disappeared. We\u00eave got to avoid that. What you cannot do is start giving the readers worse value for money. You have to think very carefully about inflicting widespread cover price increases on readers. I am not sure how price sensitive the Sunday Times is, or how price sensitive some weekly newspapers are. Daily newspapers are a different proposition \u0086 you can\u00eat just lam the cover price in and not invest some of that money back into the paper. The challenge for us is to identify the areas which are maybe less price sensitive and identify where you can put value in.\"</p> <p>A chief executive who claims he in no way yearns to become involved editorially, Graf explained that \"I enjoy being around journalists and being involved with them. It is a great privilege and sometimes I probably stay away from them because it is almost an indulgence to go and enjoy myself. So I do not see the editors every day. As long as the papers are in line with what we\u00eave all agreed is the editorial philosophy and editorial thrust of the papers, I want to let them get on and edit.\" Radical changes in the management structure, which include Joe Sinyor taking over as chief executive (newspapers) have freed Graf to concentrate on a more overall view of the business.</p> <p>But what when the traditionally Labour-supporting papers stray from what one imagines is part of the agreed editorial philosophy \u0086 the Mirror\u00eas occasional strident attacks on the government, for example, and the not infrequent rightwing political stance of the Sunday People? \"Basically, our policy is to be a critical friend [of the Labour party],\" said Graf, \"which does not mean slavish adherence. That\u00eas the policy of the national newspapers and I cannot envisage any of our nationals suggesting anyone should vote anything other than Labour in a general election.\"</p> <p><strong>Decency</strong></p> <p>Graf\u00eas faith in what he sees as an underlying decency in most journalists has not been shattered by events within the group. He may feel that the opposition goes too far in attempting to exploit their rivals\u00ea misfortunes, but he believes the industry is on the right track in curbing the excesses that made privacy legislation a real threat. \"I think self-regulation does work,\" he said, \"and I think one of the things people outside this business do not recognise is how seriously people inside \u0086 journalists and management, too \u0086 take the Press Complaints Commission. Politicians and people not directly involved talk about it not working, but don\u00eat see the amount of stuff that doesn\u00eat get in because journalists are much more thoughtful about it than they once were. The noisy cases tend to be those involving the great and the good, so they are the ones who get the publicity and the quotes in the papers. But I know of and see lots of cases that do not involve the great and the good and I see, on an everyday basis by journalists up and down the country, the care that goes into making sure people\u00eas privacy and their rights are respected. </p> <p>\"I think people inside newspapers do care. It is an area where people are called upon to make difficult judgements often very quickly and they have to make those judgements sometimes in the heat of competition, but I actually believe that editors and journalists work very hard to make sure they do not transgress. And if they do transgress, they find a way of recompense.\"</p> <p>There are those who will consider Graf\u00eas conviction and trust, and his distress when other papers attack those he controls, the height of naivet*, but he is nothing but realistic about the future of the national press in a diminishing and increasingly difficult market. \"If you ask me whether in 10 years\u00ea time there will be the same number of titles, I [would say] I would be surprised. In their present form, I think it will be difficult for them all to survive. But, then, if you ask me whether there will be the same number of companies in the television industry in 10 years\u00ea time, well, I don\u00eat think there will be. Or in the radio industry. Life will change.\" But, I wonder, will Trinity Mirror still be publishing the same number of national titles? \"I see no reason why we won\u00eat be.\"</p> <p>He is, he agrees, more likely to wake in the middle of the night thinking of the Trinity Mirror share price than the Piers Morgan shares affair \u0086 \"Although I think about the share price as a reflection of the long-term health, future and prospects of the company, not today\u00eas share price compared to yesterday\u00eas.\"</p> <p>His ambitions for the company include the growth of its internet operations, although he cautioned: \"I don\u00eat believe any of us involved believe all the hype [about the web], much of which is clearly unsustainable. We see the internet as helping us protect and develop our existing franchises and as another way of supplying information to people and services to commercial customers. Whether it is a way of making money is certainly less clear than 12 months ago. However, we believed that, given the strengths we have, can genuinely supply a service to people. It won\u00eat replace the profit stream from newspapers, absolutely not, but it is an important addition and a way of exploiting our strengths. It all depends on the regulatory framework, but there is a lot of merit in working with television and radio companies to deliver the content of our papers, for example, an and to work [with them] on internet projects.\"</p> <p>There are those who will consider Graf\u00eas faith in his journalists' conviction and trust, and his distress when other papers attack those he controls, the height of naivet*, but he is nothing but realistic about the future of the national press in a diminishing and increasingly difficult market. \"If you ask me whether in 10 years\u00ea time there will be the same number of titles, I [would say] I would be surprised. In their present form, I think it will be difficult for them all to survive. But, then, if you ask me whether there will be the same number of companies in the television industry in 10 years\u00ea time, well, I don\u00eat think there will be. Or in the radio industry. Life will change.\" But, I wonder, will Trinity Mirror still be publishing the same number of national titles? \"I see no reason why we won\u00eat be.\"</p> <p>His personal ambitions, however, are humble. He has retained the pre-merger family home in Wilmslow, Cheshire, where one of his and his wife\u00eas three daughters remains at school. The family now also has a flat in Limehouse and, he says, they balance their lives between the two places. Graf enjoys watching sport \u0086 \"I\u00eam much too idle to play\" \u0086 and going to the theatre and reading. </p> <p>\"On a personal level, I just want to keep enjoying what I am doing, because I actually believe that having fun and enjoying your job is incredibly important for your own personal health,\" he said. \"It also helps to keep a sense of perspective and, hopefully, keeps you in contact with your family. From a business perspective, if you are having fun you are much more likely to manage things and deal with people well.\" Fun? There are those who will tell you that not so long ago the very mention of the word in the managerial corridors of Mirror Group would risk fire and brimstone and wrath. </p> <p>\"Once you stop having fun, it is time to think about doing something else\", he continued. That, I observed, is very Cudlippian \u0086 the late, great Mirror editorial director, Hugh, believed papers had to be fun. \"Thank you,\" said Philip Graf. \"I take that as a compliment.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Bill Hagerty is a former deputy editor of the Daily Mirror and, subsequently, editor of the People.

      "bodyText": "Like his predecessor as chief executive of what is now Trinity Mirror newspapers, Philip Graf is an Ulsterman. But this particular Northern Irishman is not only ready to laugh, with what appears to be genuine spontaneity, at the slightest provocation, but is affable and self-effacing. Any resemblance between Philip Graf and David Montgomery, whom Graf succeeded in the Canary Wharf hot seat, is entirely implausible. When the skeletal, domineering Montgomery smiles, one can almost hear ice splintering. But jollity and the lack of it is just one of the many differences between the two men. Whereas it is a fair bet that if one were to mention the name of Montgomery to all those who have had dealings with him, a considerable proportion would spit venom, it is rare to find anyone with a bad word to say about Philip Graf. I did meet someone who was sniffy about the chief executive\u00eas skills in maintaining a healthy share price for Trinity, and forecast that he would be collecting his P45 inside six months. But as this came from a former Trinity Mirror employee, it would be unwise to give his prediction too much credence. The much-liked Graf is also, infuriatingly, too intrinsically nice a man to be nasty about anyone, even his predecessor. The popular version of events after Trinity, a powerful regional newspaper company, came courting Mirror Group, a bruised old lady who had seen better days, was that the presence of Montgomery was considered by the swain as an impediment to the match. Mirror shareholders, poised to deck themselves out in wedding finery, were not best pleased with the chief executive; neither was the Mirror board. Exit Montgomery, trundling a wheelbarrow full of compensation and share options, thus allowing, once the deliberations of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission had been concluded, the ceremony to take place. I suggested to Graf that had Montgomery not departed, the brakes would have been applied to Trinity\u00eas pursuit of Mirror Group. Mr Graf, most politely, hummed and hawed. \"Who knows?\" he replied. \"It depends on whether we could have worked out a proper board or management structure for the company. That had to be sorted out\u00c4\" But was Montgomery unacceptable to Trinity? \"If it couldn\u00eat have been sorted out, leaving personalities aside, then the deal wouldn\u00eat have happened.\" So Montgomery was unacceptable? \"Trinity felt that it was the right thing for someone from Trinity, myself, to be chief executive. There couldn\u00eat be two chief executives and there couldn\u00eat be any dubiety about what that role was.\" Rarely has a bridegroom been so chivalrous about the cad who once defiled his love. Graf is painstakingly careful when replying to any question. Had I asked him whether or not the weather was inclement, I suspect he would have spent considerable time at the window, or even out in the street with his eyes gazing skywards, before replying. During our second meeting, Graf told me how as a pre-university student he had lived for a year in California. This was at the time when the civil rights movement had begun inexorably to roll, the Vietnam war had not long begun and the unrest at Berkeley was about to explode with student protests. The experience changed his outlook on life, he told me. \"The civil rights movement helped me understand what was happening in Northern Ireland. It made me much more aware of what Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom was about. It also probably helped me to get on with a much wider range of people \u0086 it made me feel much more comfortable in dealing with people, whoever they were.\" So, I asked, did it make you more liberal? Graf responded with peals of laughter. \"I think it reinforced a lot of my views. The word liberal is capable of a number of definitions,\" he said, measuredly. \"It was\u00c4 interesting.\" Minefield Graf never shirks answering a question but the minefield through which he appears to think he is tiptoeing when being interviewed gets even more fraught when Piers Morgan\u00eas propensity for headline-making as opposed to headline-writing and the City Slickers are discussed. Asked if he was concerned about the DTI investigation into the shares affair, Graf said: \"I don\u00eat believe they will find anything untoward. If they do, we\u00eall have to review the situation, but I really don\u00eat think they will find anything as far as Piers is concerned. It was a very difficult time and a very thorough [in-house] investigation was done. \"There was an awful lot of, I have to say, ill-informed and malicious journalism about Piers, about the company, about quite a number of people. And I don\u00eat mean just the Sun stuff, which was not unexpected. The vast majority of was completely unbelievable. I found it amazing, quite honestly, how people would take a rumour and print it as fact without checking it, without understanding the implications of it. The single thing I found most disappointing about the standard of newspapers since I have been in this job was the way that was dealt with. It is not so much that we were attacked, although of course I didn\u00eat like that. The real issue is what it is doing to readers when papers operate to those standards and use their own agenda to write stuff. \"Had our investigation shown Piers had done something wrong, that would have been different. But he hadn\u00eat. I think the PCC was very clear about what he did, which was ill judged [the PCC found Morgan had \u0095fallen short of the high professional standards\u00ea demanded by its code]. The matter was actually dealt with very quickly, before that report came out. The Slickers [Anil Bhoyrul and James Hipwell] went through a proper, careful disciplinary procedure in which I was not involved and were fired. As far as I am concerned, the issue has been dealt with, unless something remarkable, unexpected and new emerges.\" But what of the internal emails published by the Sunday Times, with the paper suggesting that they indicated the editor should have been aware the Slickers would be recommending Viglen shares the morning after he bought them? These emails had not, apparently, been disclosed to the PCC. Surely this was damaging for Morgan and the company? \"I am not trying to avoid the question,\" said Graf after a pause. \"No, the email was not shown to the PCC. There was quite confidential information in the investigation we conducted. It\u00eas a perfectly reasonable question, I\u00eam just trying to remember so that I don\u00eat mislead you... The PCC was not investigating the company. It was Piers Morgan who gave evidence to the PCC, not the company, so we didn\u00eat show them any documents.\" What\u00eas normal with such inquiries is to give the PCC an analysis of events and that\u00eas what we did.\" And the email in which Morgan referred to a discussion he had with Bhoyrul on \"Viglen day\" about the merits of the editor selling other shares in order to buy Viglen - Morgan, good naturedly it seemed, called Bhoyrul a \"halfwit\" in the email. Was it conceivable that such a conversation could have taken place without the following morning\u00eas pro-Viglen story being mentioned? At best, this was stunning incompetence; at worst, malpractice. \"It\u00eas a perfectly fair question and I am being very careful how I answer it so that I don\u00eat mislead you,\" Graf repeated. \"On the face of it, it is a perfectly fair point\u00c4\" The matter was, he explained, not at the forefront of his thinking at that moment \u0086 itself perfectly fair considering how much time had elapsed since the publicity surrounding the emails \u0086 and he obtained information from those who conducted the internal investigation before replying: \"We have never denied that they [Morgan and Bhoyrul] had spoken about Viglen, but that email does not show that they talked about Viglen that day. It had appeared in the City Slickers column on several occasions, remember.\" The whole affair is as clear as a murky pond and seems to become more impenetrable the more questions one asks. I did, however, ask one more. Another email revealed, as the Sunday Times put it, Morgan\u00eas appetite for investment and the occasional free gift (he allegedly purloined from Bhoyrul a Psion Revo personal organiser given to the Slicker at a launch party). Does not this not indicate embarrassing greed on the part of the editor of the group\u00eas flagship title? \"If you are saying, was it a desire to make lots of money and to exploit his position to make lots of money? Well, I stand by the fact that I don\u00eat think that\u00eas what he was about. I think he was foolish. I think the pattern of behaviour was a foolish pattern, not a greedy pattern.\" He will, added Graf, be glad when the matter is \"finally sorted, which I think it can be and will be\". The only child of a Belfast bakery foreman of German extraction, Philip Graf was educated at Methodist College, Belfast, and then Clare College, Cambridge, where he read law. The Belfast Telegraph came into the family home every day. and in the early 1960s the young Graf \u0086 he is now 54 \u0086 developed a passion for newspapers in general, but the Telegraph in particular, as the political and social changes in the province began to make headlines daily. At Cambridge, he worked on Varsity, briefly as sports editor and then as business manager \u0086 \"So I had early experience of signing people\u00eas expenses!\" After university, he got his opportunity in the newspaper industry with Thomson Regional Newspapers in London, working in marketing, advertising and research before returning to Belfast and the Thomson-owned Telegraph, where he became group circulation and marketing controller (he was \"pretty cross\" when, two decades later, the Monopolies Commission forced Trinity-Mirror to sell it after the merger) . His love affair with the paper was to continue, off and on, until it became a casualty of the Trinity-Mirror merger, the Monopolies Commission deciding that the combined group must shed the title to stay within regulatory limits. Disappointing Graf was not best pleased at this: \"Having to sell the Telegraph was one of the most disappointing things that has ever happened to me. I was pretty cross about it. We still have the Derry Journal and the Newsletter in Belfast, and I am very pleased about that, but to end my long association with the Telegraph was very disappointing.\" On his way up the managerial ladder he worked in circulation, marketing, market research and promotions. During the early days of bingo in newspapers, he recalls, his legal background came in useful and \"for a brief period I was one of the few people in the country who actually understood the gaming laws as they applied to bingo\". He next joined Trinity in Liverpool, becoming an assistant managing director of the Liverpool Post and Echo in 1984, a member of the Trinity board in 1987 and rising to become its chief executive in 1993. The acquisition of the Thomson group in 1995 moved Trinity into the big league. Graf recalls: \"it was then that we looked at how we were going to move on. It was clear company policy that we would go beyond regional newspapers, but where we would go was a question we constantly worked at. [Then] It became clear the Mirror was a possibility.\" In what to some City observers seemed an audacious move \u0086 MGN was much the bigger of the two companies \u0086 was, confesses Graf, fraught with problems: \"It was hard, looking back, but I think there were times when we doubted it would ever happen.\" Trinity edged out Regional Independent Media and captured Mirror Group for \u00a31.24bn. With Montgomery gone and while the Monopolies Commission brooded, MGN\u00eas John Allwood, who was to become Graf\u00eas deputy under the chairmanship of the already incumbent Sir Victor Blank, began to rationalise the group, a policy Graf continued when he arrived. Among the early casualties of the Trinity regime was Live TV, the machinations around which had over recent years proved far more entertaining than anything shown on screen. But, typically, Graf refuses to be too horrid about Janet Street-Porter, Kelvin MacKenzie and topless darts/Janet Street-Porter battleground that bred topless darts and chaos and helped fill gossip and media columns and an entire book: \"Live TV had\u00c4 how can I put it?\u00c4 an interesting history,\" said the chief executive. \"As a brand it had become damaged, and damaged beyond repair, but I wouldn\u00eat criticise people for having a go at doing what they tried to do. It was unfortunate the way it turned out. What it became was a bit of a laughing stock, which is unfair in many ways because it had some very good people and some very good ideas.\" Bearing in mind that all most people can remember about Live is MacKenzie\u00eas efforts to bring page three culture to television, Graf is again being charitable. With Graf, the \"No more nice guy\" reputation of most media moguls is translated to \"Lots more nice guy\" with Graf. The national newspapers were in \"pretty reasonable shape\" when he arrived, he recalls. \"There were some issues in Birmingham that we had to sort out [Trinity discovered circulation figures at the Post, Evening Mail and Sunday Mercury had been fraudulently enhanced over a long period], but morale was good and there was an underlying sense of confidence \"But I felt all along that I wasn\u00eat coming here to be the manager of national newspapers, but to run a group, and clearly there are differences [between national and provincial papers] \u0086 there is a different competitive dynamic, a different dynamic in circulation versus advertising, a different dynamic in terms of the profile the papers have.\" I set out to meet people, to listen to people, to understand people and deal with them fairly and rationally. I believe people respect that.\" Radical changes in the management structure, which include Joe Sinyor taking over as chief executive (newspapers) have freed Graf to concentrate on a more overall view of the business. There was much inference at the time, I reminded him, that Trinity would, as a provincial company, struggle to manage the cosmopolitan colossus created by the merger and, also, speculation that they would sell on the national newspapers. Graf chuckled at this: \"Inferred? It was said, not inferred \u0086 you\u00eare being very polite about it. As I said at the time, the difficulty for me was getting the straw out of my hair and clearing the pigs out of the kitchen in the morning before I read that stuff. It was inevitable, understandable, perhaps, because the Mirror was a bigger company in capitalisation terms \u0086 I suppose people thought the way the transaction took place, in terms of history, was not that usual. \"Selling on the national titles was never part of the game plan. Trinity felt the national titles were an important complement to the regional titles and the opportunity was there to see them develop together. I know there was an awful lot of talk at the time about that and it was partly encouraged by people who chose not to understand what we were trying to do. But here [at Canary Wharf] I found a good bunch of people wanting to take the business forward and realising that putting two businesses of this size and scale together is not easy, particularly if you are newspaper companies, where you are more in the public eye than if you were a widget company. Progress \"I think we\u00eave done pretty well, but we know we\u00eave got to do better. \"If you look at it from a financial perspective,\" Since the deal in 1999, he says, \"from a financial perspective we\u00eave delivered the numbers we said we would deliver. In terms of taking the business forward, we\u00eave made good progress, but not enough. We are looking to step up our pace there. At the minute, Trinity Mirror is the leading regional publisher, which is very nice. But the issue is not whether you are number one or number two in terms of circulation, but whether you\u00eave actually got the right business and a good business, with good newspapers at its heart. Now we want to continue to develop our existing newspapers, but also look at how we can move the business by acquisition.\" (And by recently acquiring the Southnews papers for \u00a3284.6m, Trinity Mirror boosted the titles under Graf\u00eas control to 260). It is a tough challenge, because prices are high and the world is changing and there are some big players around the place. But there are still opportunities in regional newspapers for us to look at and we\u00eall continue to do that.\" (They did, too: shortly after our first conversation. And, indeed, Trinity Mirror has recently acquired the 84 free and paid-for titles of the southeast regional group, Southnews, for \u00a3284.6m. This brings the number of newspapers and magazine titles under Graf\u00eas control to 260.) Might Trinity Mirror be interested in acquiring more national papers, I wondered? \"I think that is very unlikely,\" said Graf. I returned to the subject when we met for a second time, shortly after Richard Desmond had acquired the Express group. Was Trinity not tempted to enter the bidding for the Express, especially as the Daily Star and Sunday People would have made comfy bedfellows? \"No. We felt that to make a success of it in its particular competitive environment is always going to take a lot of money and effort. It just looked as if to develop any of the titles sensibly, you were going to have to spend quite a lot of money on them. I mean, there is no point in buying newspapers like that and saying, \u0095Right, we\u00eall buy them and just run them into the ground\u00ea.\" Does this mean Richard Desmond may have bitten off more than he possibly can chew? \"I am sure he has thought about that very carefully,\" said Graf, very carefully. \"He has certainly taken on a very formidable competitor in the DMGT [Daily Mail and General Trust]. They haven\u00eat messed about, have they?\" Soon after taking over the Express group, Desmond has mentioned that he might launch a Sunday version of the Daily Star. David Sullivan, proprietor of Sunday Sport, had made similar noises about a new Sunday tabloid. The last thing Trinity Mirror needs, I suggested, were further challengers in a fiercely competitive national Sunday market, where the Sunday People and, to a lesser extent, the Sunday Mirror, trail further and further behind in the wake of the News of the World. \"If and when that situation arises we shall have to react appropriately,\" said Graf, \"but there is no indication it is imminent.\" Earlier he had told me: \"I think all established media are in some sort of slight decline. Look at radio, look at television. But we still remain a very powerful mass media. \"The Sunday market is tough and I am not going to sit here and pretend I\u00eave got a solution for it. Social changes have transformed the British Sunday and made life tougher for, in particular, the Sunday red-tops. I think the Sunday Mirror has done well for us over the last couple of years. The Sunday People is a tougher challenge. Its rate of decline has slowed, but we\u00eave got to keep working at it.\" Does this mean the Sunday People makes a profit? \"Oh, absolutely. But nobody here underestimates the week-to-week challenge it has. Its rate of decline has slowed, but we\u00eave got to keep working at it.\" Would he, I ask, contemplate selling the Sunday People if the decline continued? \"I don\u00eat like selling titles.\" Or close it? \"At this stage, I see no reason to do either.\" When I first met Graf, the ABC circulation figures for all three titles were disappointing and there was an even gloomier report from the National Readership Survey, showing a sharp drop for the Mirror and only a minor one for the Sun. \"It\u00eas the fundamental ABC performance of the paper over a certain amount of time that concerns me, \" he said, \"and I am very happy with what the Mirror has done in that respect.\" (The latest figures make unhappy reading for him, though: in February it was showing a 3.25% year-on-year decline). Nevertheless, 16 months down the road the CEO is not dissatisfied. It has, however, been a bumpy journey, with Morgan coming perilously close to tumbling down a pothole and both Daily Record editor Martin and Trinity Mirror\u00eas managing director of national titles Roger Eastoe falling by the wayside somewhat abruptly. It was the wish of Eastoe, a long-time Mirror servant who had rubbed along with a succession of Mirror overlords, including Robert Maxwell, like a faithful sheepdog, to leave the group, insisted Graf. \"We needed to change the way the company was organised, to take the business forward, and Roger felt he would rather leave the company than take a role in that change.\" Three new senior managers \u0086 a chief executive of the company\u00eas newspapers and two managing directors, one for the regionals, another for the national titles \u0086 are now in place. Attacks Graf is far less forthcoming about reputed hard man Martin Clarke, who left the editorship of the Daily Record after his public admonishment of deputy sports editor Alan Rowan resulted in the resignation of several members of the sports department. Apart from insisting that Clarke\u00eas departure was unconnected with this particular incident \u0086 the word at Canary Wharf is that Clarke\u00eas attacks on ailing Scottish first minister Donald Dewar and general rightwing political stance alienated him from Trinity\u00eas top management \u0086 Graf will say only: \"I\u00eam unwilling to discuss the departure of Martin Clarke. As far as we are concerned, he resigned.\" When I first spoke with Graf, the circulation figures for all three titles were . \"We are slightly at a loss to understand what has happened to the readers per copy issue and we have been talking to the NRS about it,\" Graf confessed. \"It is not because all of a sudden we have lots of bulk sales. Frankly, I don\u00eat have a straightforward answer to it, but it is the fundamental ABC performance of the paper over a certain amount of time that concerns me and I am very happy with what the Mirror has done in that respect.\" (The latest circulation figures for the paper, however, make unhappy reading for all at Trinity Mirror: in February it was showing a 3.25 per cent year-on-year decline \u0086 far greater if bulk sales are discounted \u0086 against a year-on-year increase of almost 1%, and an even greater bulk-excluded figure, for the Sun.) At our second meeting, I discussed with Graf the difficulties facing the industry, especially its red-top titles, and asked if added value was the only way to slow, if not prevent, decline. \"I think there is a limit [to added value],\" he said, \"and some of the papers at the weekend must be getting very close to that limit, if they are not already at it, from the point of view of the reader. The extra challenge we have got is that newsprint prices are going up this year for the first time in a number of years and they are going to go up in double digits. That\u00eas a significant challenge for all of us, as to how we deal with it. \"Historically, newspapers\u00ea reactions to newsprint prices going up was a very simple one \u0086 to put the price up and cut the value. And then wonder why the readers disappeared. We\u00eave got to avoid that. What you cannot do is start giving the readers worse value for money. You have to think very carefully about inflicting widespread cover price increases on readers. I am not sure how price sensitive the Sunday Times is, or how price sensitive some weekly newspapers are. Daily newspapers are a different proposition \u0086 you can\u00eat just lam the cover price in and not invest some of that money back into the paper. The challenge for us is to identify the areas which are maybe less price sensitive and identify where you can put value in.\" A chief executive who claims he in no way yearns to become involved editorially, Graf explained that \"I enjoy being around journalists and being involved with them. It is a great privilege and sometimes I probably stay away from them because it is almost an indulgence to go and enjoy myself. So I do not see the editors every day. As long as the papers are in line with what we\u00eave all agreed is the editorial philosophy and editorial thrust of the papers, I want to let them get on and edit.\" Radical changes in the management structure, which include Joe Sinyor taking over as chief executive (newspapers) have freed Graf to concentrate on a more overall view of the business. But what when the traditionally Labour-supporting papers stray from what one imagines is part of the agreed editorial philosophy \u0086 the Mirror\u00eas occasional strident attacks on the government, for example, and the not infrequent rightwing political stance of the Sunday People? \"Basically, our policy is to be a critical friend [of the Labour party],\" said Graf, \"which does not mean slavish adherence. That\u00eas the policy of the national newspapers and I cannot envisage any of our nationals suggesting anyone should vote anything other than Labour in a general election.\" Decency Graf\u00eas faith in what he sees as an underlying decency in most journalists has not been shattered by events within the group. He may feel that the opposition goes too far in attempting to exploit their rivals\u00ea misfortunes, but he believes the industry is on the right track in curbing the excesses that made privacy legislation a real threat. \"I think self-regulation does work,\" he said, \"and I think one of the things people outside this business do not recognise is how seriously people inside \u0086 journalists and management, too \u0086 take the Press Complaints Commission. Politicians and people not directly involved talk about it not working, but don\u00eat see the amount of stuff that doesn\u00eat get in because journalists are much more thoughtful about it than they once were. The noisy cases tend to be those involving the great and the good, so they are the ones who get the publicity and the quotes in the papers. But I know of and see lots of cases that do not involve the great and the good and I see, on an everyday basis by journalists up and down the country, the care that goes into making sure people\u00eas privacy and their rights are respected. \"I think people inside newspapers do care. It is an area where people are called upon to make difficult judgements often very quickly and they have to make those judgements sometimes in the heat of competition, but I actually believe that editors and journalists work very hard to make sure they do not transgress. And if they do transgress, they find a way of recompense.\" There are those who will consider Graf\u00eas conviction and trust, and his distress when other papers attack those he controls, the height of naivet*, but he is nothing but realistic about the future of the national press in a diminishing and increasingly difficult market. \"If you ask me whether in 10 years\u00ea time there will be the same number of titles, I [would say] I would be surprised. In their present form, I think it will be difficult for them all to survive. But, then, if you ask me whether there will be the same number of companies in the television industry in 10 years\u00ea time, well, I don\u00eat think there will be. Or in the radio industry. Life will change.\" But, I wonder, will Trinity Mirror still be publishing the same number of national titles? \"I see no reason why we won\u00eat be.\" He is, he agrees, more likely to wake in the middle of the night thinking of the Trinity Mirror share price than the Piers Morgan shares affair \u0086 \"Although I think about the share price as a reflection of the long-term health, future and prospects of the company, not today\u00eas share price compared to yesterday\u00eas.\" His ambitions for the company include the growth of its internet operations, although he cautioned: \"I don\u00eat believe any of us involved believe all the hype [about the web], much of which is clearly unsustainable. We see the internet as helping us protect and develop our existing franchises and as another way of supplying information to people and services to commercial customers. Whether it is a way of making money is certainly less clear than 12 months ago. However, we believed that, given the strengths we have, can genuinely supply a service to people. It won\u00eat replace the profit stream from newspapers, absolutely not, but it is an important addition and a way of exploiting our strengths. It all depends on the regulatory framework, but there is a lot of merit in working with television and radio companies to deliver the content of our papers, for example, an and to work [with them] on internet projects.\" There are those who will consider Graf\u00eas faith in his journalists' conviction and trust, and his distress when other papers attack those he controls, the height of naivet*, but he is nothing but realistic about the future of the national press in a diminishing and increasingly difficult market. \"If you ask me whether in 10 years\u00ea time there will be the same number of titles, I [would say] I would be surprised. In their present form, I think it will be difficult for them all to survive. But, then, if you ask me whether there will be the same number of companies in the television industry in 10 years\u00ea time, well, I don\u00eat think there will be. Or in the radio industry. Life will change.\" But, I wonder, will Trinity Mirror still be publishing the same number of national titles? \"I see no reason why we won\u00eat be.\" His personal ambitions, however, are humble. He has retained the pre-merger family home in Wilmslow, Cheshire, where one of his and his wife\u00eas three daughters remains at school. The family now also has a flat in Limehouse and, he says, they balance their lives between the two places. Graf enjoys watching sport \u0086 \"I\u00eam much too idle to play\" \u0086 and going to the theatre and reading. \"On a personal level, I just want to keep enjoying what I am doing, because I actually believe that having fun and enjoying your job is incredibly important for your own personal health,\" he said. \"It also helps to keep a sense of perspective and, hopefully, keeps you in contact with your family. From a business perspective, if you are having fun you are much more likely to manage things and deal with people well.\" Fun? There are those who will tell you that not so long ago the very mention of the word in the managerial corridors of Mirror Group would risk fire and brimstone and wrath. \"Once you stop having fun, it is time to think about doing something else\", he continued. That, I observed, is very Cudlippian \u0086 the late, great Mirror editorial director, Hugh, believed papers had to be fun. \"Thank you,\" said Philip Graf. \"I take that as a compliment.\" \u0095 Bill Hagerty is a former deputy editor of the Daily Mirror and, subsequently, editor of the People.

      "bodyText": "Yugoslav troops are to take over the entire Nato-imposed buffer zone between Kosovo and Serbia in a high-risk strategy which could ignite a wider Albanian guerrilla insurgency in the southern Balkans. Following last week's limited and successful redeployment in a small part of the buffer zone bordering Macedonia, more Yugoslav troops are to be deployed in the southern Serbian zone this week, the Yugoslav interior minister, Zoran Zivkovic, said at the weekend. Forced by Nato to retreat from the three-mile wide buffer zone as part of the settlement that ended the Kosovo war almost two years ago, the Serbs, under new democratic leadership, are warily celebrating the return of their troops and the recovery of lost sovereignty over the Presevo valley area. It is part of Serbia proper, though it abuts Kosovo and is mainly populated by ethnic Albanians. Some 5,000 Albanians gathered in Presevo's sports stadium on Saturday to protest at the return of the Serb military, whom they view as their oppressors, despite the pledges from the Belgrade leadership that the post-Milosevic era means that peace negotiations will be conducted in good faith. \"Our troops have returned to where they belong,\" said Mr Zivkovic. Within a month, he predicted, the buffer zone would be under the Yugoslav army and police, setting the stage for political negotiations between Belgrade and the Kosovo Albanian leadership. But sporadic Albanian guerrilla fire peppered Yugoslav army positions over the weekend, and two Yugoslav soldiers were injured, one needing to have a leg amputated, when their vehicle hit a mine. Albanian guerrillas have exploited the vacuum in the area since last November to expand de facto Albanian control beyond Kosovo itself. If the level of fighting over the mountains in neighbouring Macedonia increases, the tense situation in the Presevo valley could take a more menacing turn. Riza Halimi, the Albanian mayor of Presevo, told the weekend demonstration that \"we wish to let the authorities in Belgrade and the international community know that the two basic demands of Albanian citizens are the total demilitarisation of the region, and the return of displaced persons.\" Last week's return of the Yugoslav army, under Nato supervision, was preceded by a truce signed by local Albanian guerrillas. But that truce expires today and any return to hostilities would be a severe setback for Nato. It would entail the worst armed clashes between the Albanians and Serb troops since the end of the Kosovo war, and would also be a grave challenge for the young and inexperienced Yugoslav and Serbian governments. Yugoslav army top brass met in Belgrade on Saturday to discuss the situation in the south and prepare for further entry to the buffer zone. The meeting was chaired by Gen Nebojsa Pavkovic, the controversial chief of staff who was the first Serbian officer into the security zone last Wednesday, reinforcing the Albanians' fears. Gen Pavkovic commanded President Slobodan Milosevic's campaign against Kosovo in 1998 and 1999 and was promoted to his current position by the now-deposed leader. Senior figures in the new Belgrade government have called for Gen Pavkovic to be sacked, but President Vojislav Kostunica, constitutionally the commander-in-chief, has refused to fire him because the general did not turn his troops against the mass demonstrations which toppled Milosevic last October.",

      "body": "<p>In the labyrinth of buildings squatting along Wapping Highway in east London, there live two fabled lawyers, Brett &amp; Crone. Between them, Brett &amp; Crone cater for all Rupert Murdoch's legal needs. Mess with any of his British newspapers and Brett &amp; Crone swing into resolute action. They are clever, resourceful and experienced. And just now they are very busy. </p> <p>Brett is in the high court today defending the Times against a libel charge brought by a Russian businessmen. A block away from Brett's office in Wapping, Crone is urgently drafting a defence for the Times's sister paper, the Sun, over a claim that its journalism infringed the Protection From Harassment Act 1997. </p> <p>Brett - Alastair Brett, to give him his full due - is asking judges to reward \"responsible\" newspapers by giving them more protection for journalism deemed to be in the public interest. </p> <p>Meanwhile Crone - Tom Crone , the legal manager of News International - is asking judges to give the Sun the licence to publish articles that even its lawyer admits were \"strident, aggressive and inflammatory.\" </p> <p>Brett and the Times are fighting a libel action against one Dr Grigori Loutchansky, who is suing the paper for linking him and his Nordex group of companies to organised crime - a link which he has consistently denied. </p> <p>Crone and the Sun are fighting Esther Thomas, a black 29-year-old former civilian clerk with the City of London Police, who recently won a landmark ruling in Lambeth county court. She can now pursue her claim that a series of articles about her - and about the complaints of racism she had made against three police colleagues - constituted harassment. </p> <p>Brett &amp; Crone will naturally adopt different arguments and tactics in each case. But in the deeper recesses of their erudite minds - the fathomless cranial cavities marked \"Without Prejudice\" - each doubtless recognises that the two cases are linked. </p> <p>They are not only linked to each other, they are linked to a whole barrage of other cases at various stages of assorted legal and regulatory slipways around London. </p> <p>\u0095 There is the case of Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones, in which the Hollywood celebrities have won the backing of a court of appeal judge for their argument that they have a right to privacy under the Human Rights Act. </p> <p>\u0095 There is the supermodel Naomi Campbell who is also threatening to use the Human Rights Act against the Mirror for taking long-lens pictures of her leaving a Narcotics Anonymous meeting in Fulham in February. </p> <p>\u0095 There is the newscaster Anna Ford, who is discussing with lawyers the possibility of going for judicial review of a press complaints com mission ruling that she had no right to privacy while on a Spanish beach with her partner and children. </p> <p>Not all these cases will come to court. Some clearly have more merit than others. But they all concern fundamental issues about the extent to which freedom of expression has to be balanced with other rights - the right to a reputation, the right to privacy, the right to be free from racial harassment, and so on. </p> <p>It is only fair to point out that worries about privacy are not the exclusive preserve of celebrities. Richard Desmond, the new owner of the Express, is very particular about his own press. And his battle with the Mail has demonstrated that Associated's chairman, Jonathan Rothermere, dislikes his own privacy being invaded. He is also currently in discussions with the Mail's official historian, Sally Taylor, over references to his late father's life in a forthcoming book. </p> <p>The reality is dawning on newspaper lawyers and editors that the courts are - with some degree of relish - about to embark on a process of establishing and developing a right to privacy, as enshrined within Article Eight of the European Convention on Human Rights. </p> <p>At the same time lawyers and editors are waking up to the realisation that - despite recent advances - the English libel laws still remain an unpredictable and awesome weapon in the hands of determined claimants. </p> <p>Paul Dacre at the Mail had an unpleasant shock last month when he was ordered to pay Alan Sugar \u00a3100,000 (plus costs estimated at well over \u00a3500,000) for the paper accusing him of being a miserly boss while in charge at Tottenham. </p> <p>Many lawyers had imagined that the days of enormous damages against newspapers were past. But the jury in the Sugar trial awarded the same sum for hurt feelings that the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme recommends for the loss of both arms or the loss of both eyes. (They later reached an out of court compromise on \u00a360,000 - itself equivalent to both the loss of a tongue and an injury causing \"permanent disabling mental disorder.\") </p> <p>David Yelland at the Sun was naturally pleased to win his recent appeal against Bruce Grobbelaar, the goalkeeper accused of throwing matches. He will have been less pleased at the judges' scathing rejection of the paper's appeal to have some form of qualified privilege for its reporting. </p> <p>The issue of qualified privilege (see below) - a measure of protection for journalism in the public interest - was also at the heart of a powerful editorial written last week by the Times editor, Peter Stothard, in relation to his case beginning today in the high court. In pre-trial argument in the court of appeal last week the Times was prevented from using certain material as part of its defence. </p> <p>Add to this melange of cases a number of other controversial issues - the right to report courts, the right to report local councils, the threat of being sued in distant countries for material posted on the internet, the right to receive information from the police - and you currently have a lot of editors and lawyers extremely concerned about the gradual erosion of press freedom in this country. </p> <p>The challenge facing the press is whether it is prepared to see these issues as in any way connected and whether editors can see a way of forming a common cause to fight these threats together. </p> <p>Take our friends Brett &amp; Crone. Broadsheet Brett wants to get more concessions for the press so that responsible Mr Stothard can write about people in public life in an unencumbered way. But Mr Brett, being a sophisticated sort, will know that no politician or judge is going to make a single concession to the press without cast-iron guarantees that it wouldn't be used to help tabloid editors kick down bedroom doors. </p> <p>Mr Stothard himself would probably not be unduly worried by giving guarantees on privacy (with appropriate public interest safeguards) if he could get a decent libel law on the statute books. The Times does not often invade people's privacy without good reason. </p> <p>Over the road at Wapping, Mr Crone currently approaches the problem from precisely the other end of the telescope. Mr Crone will fight tooth and nail to prevent any concessions on privacy. His papers - rather more profitable to Mr Murdoch than the Times - thrive on invading privacy. Libel, to him, is a secondary issue. </p> <p>So the reality is that unless Brett &amp; Crone - and their counterparts on other titles - can work out some kind of common path, the press will never present a united front on many of these issues. And without a united front from the press it is inevitable that other people will sort it out for them. </p> <p>Those \"other people\" are likely to be judges. Politicians may run scared at the first whiff of grapeshot from Lord Wakeham or the executive chairman of News International, Les Hinton. Judges are another matter altogether. </p> <p>Recent judgments in a variety of courts since the introduction of the Human Rights Act have tended to show a keen appreciation of the importance of Article 10, which protects freedom of expression. </p> <p>But - as the Grobbelaar, Zeta-Jones, Lambeth and Albert Reynolds cases show - judges are also determined to carve out a concept of responsible reporting which shows due recognition of other, sometimes conflicting, rights. </p> <p>The press's traditional answer is to plead that everything should be left to self-regulation. The Anna Ford judicial review, if it goes ahead, will be a stern test of that. </p> <p>Firstly, the case would establish whether or not PCC judgments are capable of judicial review (answer: probably yes). It would then establish whether the PCC's assorted judgments on long-lens photography amount to a coherent policy (answer: probably not). In the longer term the PCC may have to demonstrate that it offers sufficient remedies - as required by the Human Rights Act. </p> <p>There may or may not be limited sympathy for celebrities who take to the courts. The case of Esther Thomas is a different kettle of fish, involving as it does an ordinary young black woman - in no conventional sense a public figure. </p> <p>On any account she suffered an extremely unpleasant experience as a result of the attacks on her by Sun journalists and readers. Whether this is enough to justify any form of legal protection is another issue: it would be easy to see any number of Vazes, Hindujas and Ashcrofts rushing in on her coat tails. </p> <p>Because there are so many current cases involving vital issues of freedom of expression, the Guardian is launching a regular media law page. In this section every week we will examine these issues in some depth. I very much hope that the players in these issues will take part in this important debate. Including, or even especially, Messrs Brett &amp; Crone. </p> <p><strong> Qualified Privilege (QP)</strong> </p> <p> QP is the concept that papers ought to receive extra protection from being sued for libel if they are writing about matters in the public interest and which the public has an interest in receiving. </p> <p>In America the so-called Sullivan doctrine means that public figures find it virtually impossible to sue newspapers unless they can prove that they were reckless or motivated by malice. Newspapers are protected, even if they make honest mistakes. </p> <p>In British law the judgment in the libel action brought by Albert Reynolds against the Sunday Times provides certain protection for newspapers. But they have to satisfy certain conditions before they can claim QP. </p> <p>Judges will consider, among other things, the seriousness of the charges, the source of the information, the steps taken to verify the information, the urgency of the matter and whether comment was sought from the claimant before publication. </p> <p>\u0095 Alan Rusbridger is editor of the Guardian and a member of the Society of Editors' Parliamentary and Legal Committee.</p>",

The warning follows a meeting last Friday of the Express Newspapers NUJ chapel. An overwhelming vote to prepare a ballot for industrial action was passed, with four votes against and 11 abstentions. Mr Dear said he wanted to make it clear the only way to prevent redundancies was to opt for industrial action. He spoke following speculation over the weekend that an overwhelming number of journalists may push for voluntary redundancy. The NUJ is keen to prevent as many journalists as possible from leaving the paper in the short term. The union believes resistance across the board to Richard Desmond's plans could prevent the Express Newspapers chief from making the cutbacks. But insiders say the NUJ's ambitions may be optimistic. Sources claim a number of senior staff are already negotiating to leave the paper. Last week it was confirmed Express Newspapers would shed 145 journalists.

      "bodyText": "Beleaguered magazine group Future Network has plunged into the red after a \"bruising\" year took its toll on the company. The publisher, which specialises in computer and new technology titles, said the weak computer games market and a downturn in new media advertising had contributed to a slump in last year's figures, which came in below analysts' expectations. There appears to be no sign of a quick turnaround in the group's fortunes, as it forecast a \"substantial loss\" for the first half of 2001. It reported an operating loss of \u00a32.5m last year, against an operating profit of \u00a320.2m for 1999. Future Network, whose flagship title is Business 2.0, has been hit by the change in fortunes in the internet sector. The company has issued two profit warnings in the last eight months, and made drastic cutbacks including the loss of 350 jobs and closure of 20 magazines. \"For all the revenue growth and momentum, 2000 ultimately became a bruising year for Future,\" said Greg Ingham, chief executive of the group. Mr Ingham added that despite a 28% growth in revenues to \u00a3254m, the company was buffeted by a number of \"external and internal factors\" in the last four months of the year. \"The much weaker games market, the dot.com collapse, a general tech downturn and softer advertising markets all contributed to a performance that was some way below expectations,\" he said. Future Network also announced the resignation of finance director Ian Linkins, with former Emap executive Colin Morrison stepping up to chief operating officer. The boardroom changes are a response to investors' demands for management change at the company, which has issued two profit warnings over the past four months. \"Future's clear goal for 2001 and 2002 is to restore the company to positive cashflow by the resolute focus on our core business,\" said Chris Anderson, chairman of Future Network. The group is leaving no stone unturned in the quest to reverse its slump in fortunes. Last month Future announced the loss of 350 jobs and the closure of 20 magazine titles. A core part of the recovery strategy is the sale of the Business 2.0 e-economy title and there has been strong interest in a publication whose fortunes are closely tied to the strength of the technology market. But Future Network is still exposed to weakness in the computer games market, which is the source of 35% of its revenue and is in virtual recession following the delay in launching the PlayStation 2 console.

      "trailText": "<p>Philip Graf is still popular after 16 months as Trinity Mirror boss but he's had a hard baptism, writes  <strong>Bill Hagerty</strong>.</p>",
      "byline": "Bill Hagerty",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Like his predecessor as chief executive of what is now Trinity Mirror newspapers, Philip Graf is an Ulsterman. But this particular Northern Irishman is not only ready to laugh at the slightest provocation, but is affable and self-effacing. Nationality apart, there is no resemblance between Philip Graf and David Montgomery, whom Graf succeeded in the Canary Wharf hot seat. </p> <p>When the skeletal, domineering Montgomery smiles, you can almost hear ice splintering. But jollity and the lack of it is just one of the many differences. It is a fair bet that the name of Montgomery would produce venom from some who have had dealings with him, but it is rare to find anyone with a bad word to say about Graf. </p> <p>Painstakingly careful over his replies, Graf never shirks answering a question but the minefield through which he appears to think he is tiptoeing during this interview gets even more dangerous when Piers Morgan and the City Slickers are discussed. Asked if he was concerned about the DTI investigation into the shares affair, Graf told me: \"I don't believe they will find anything untoward. If they do, we'll have to review the situation, but I really don't think they will find anything as far as Piers is concerned. I think the PCC was very clear about what he did, which was ill-judged [the PCC found that Morgan had \"fallen short of the high professional standards\" demanded by its code]. The matter was actually dealt with very quickly, before that report came out. </p> <p>\"The Slickers [Anil Bhoyrul and James Hipwell] went through a proper, careful disciplinary procedure in which I was not involved and were fired. As far as I am concerned, the issue has been dealt with, unless something remarkable, unexpected and new emerges.\" </p> <p>But what of the internal emails published by the Sunday Times, which the paper suggested indicated that the editor should have been aware the Slickers would be recommending Viglen shares the morning after he bought them? These emails had not, apparently, been disclosed to the PCC. Surely this was damaging for Morgan and the company? </p> <p>\"No, the email was not shown to the PCC. The PCC was not investigating the company. It was Piers Morgan who gave evidence to the PCC, not the company, so we didn't show them any documents.\" And the email in which Morgan referred to a discussion he had with Bhoyrul on \"Viglen day\" about the merits of the editor selling other shares in order to buy Viglen - was it conceivable that such a conversation could have taken place without the following morning's pro-Viglen story being mentioned? \"We've never denied that they had spoken about Viglen, but that email does not show that they talked about Viglen that day. It had appeared in the City Slickers column on several occasions, remember.\" </p> <p>Another email revealed, as the Sunday Times put it, Morgan's appetite for investment and the occasional free gift: does not this not indicate embarrassing greed on the part of the editor of the group's flagship title? \"If you are saying, was it a desire to exploit his position to make lots of money, well, I stand by the fact that the pattern of behaviour was a foolish pattern, not a greedy pattern.\" </p> <p>The only child of a Belfast bakery foreman of German extraction, Philip Graf was educated at Methodist College, Belfast, and then Cambridge, where he read law. The Belfast Telegraph came into the family home every day. After university, he got his opportunity in the newspaper industry with Thomson Regional Newspapers, before returning to Belfast and the Thomson-owned Telegraph, where he became group circulation and marketing controller (he was \"pretty cross\" when, two decades later, the Monopolies Commission forced Trinity-Mirror to sell it after the merger). He next joined Trinity in Liverpool, rising to chief executive in 1993. </p> <p>The acquisition of the Thomson group in 1995 moved Trinity into the big league. Graf recalls: \"It was clear company policy that we would go beyond regional newspapers, but where we would go was a question we constantly worked at. [Then] It became clear the Mirror was a possibility.\" In what, to some City observers, seemed an audacious move - MGN was much the bigger of the two companies - Trinity edged out Regional Independent Media and captured Mirror Group for \u00a31.24bn. </p> <p>Among the early casualties of the Trinity regime was L!ve TV. But, typically, Graf refuses to be horrid about Janet, Kelvin and topless darts. \"As a brand it had become damaged beyond repair, but I wouldn't criticise people for having a go at doing what they tried to do. It was unfortunate the way it turned out.\" </p> <p>Since the 1999 deal, he says, \"From a financial perspective, we've delivered the numbers we said we would deliver. In terms of taking the business forward, we are looking to step up our pace. Trinity Mirror is the leading regional publisher, which is very nice. Now we want to continue to develop our existing newspapers, but also look at how we can move the business by acquisition.\" (And by recently acquiring the Southnews papers for \u00a3284.6m, Trinity Mirror boosted the titles under Graf's control to 260). </p> <p>Was Trinity not tempted to enter the bidding for the Express, especially as the Daily Star and Sunday People would have made comfy bedfellows? \"No. We felt that to make a success of it in its particular competitive environment is always going to take a lot of money and effort.\" Does this mean Richard Desmond may have bitten off more than he possibly can chew? \"I am sure he has thought about that very carefully,\" says Graf, very carefully. \"He has certainly taken on a very formidable competitor in the DMGT [Daily Mail and General Trust]. They haven't messed about, have they?\" </p> <p>Desmond has talked of launching a Sunday version of the Daily Star. David Sullivan, proprietor of the Sport, has made similar noises about a new Sunday tabloid. The last thing Trinity Mirror needs, I suggested, were further challengers in a fiercely competitive national Sunday market, where the Sunday People and, to a lesser extent, the Sunday Mirror, trail further and further behind in the wake of the News of the World. </p> <p>\"If and when that situation arises we shall have to react appropriately,\" says Graf. \"The Sunday market is tough and I am not going to sit here and pretend I've got a solution for it. Social changes have transformed the British Sunday and made life tougher for, in particular, the Sunday red-tops. I think the Sunday Mirror has done well for us over the last couple of years. The Sunday People is a tougher challenge. Its rate of decline has slowed, but we've got to keep working at it.\" </p> <p>At the time of the first of my two long interviews with Graf, the ABC circulation figures for all three titles were disappointing and there was an even gloomier report from the National Readership Survey, showing a sharp drop for the Mirror and only a minor one for The Sun. \"It's the fundamental ABC performance of the paper over a certain amount of time that concerns me,\" he said, \"and I am very happy with what the Mirror has done in that respect.\" (The latest figures make unhappy reading for him, though: in February it was showing a 3.25% year-on-year decline). </p> <p>Nevertheless, 16 months down the road, the CEO is not dissatisfied. It has, however, been a bumpy journey, with Morgan coming perilously close to tumbling down a pothole and both Daily Record editor Martin Clarke (\"I'm afraid I'm unwilling to discuss the departure of Martin Clarke\") and Trinity Mirror's managing director of national titles Roger Eastoe falling by the wayside somewhat abruptly. He is, he agrees, more likely to wake in the middle of the night thinking of the Trinity Mirror share price than the Piers Morgan shares affair - \"Although I think about the share price as a reflection of the long-term health, future and prospects of the company, not today's share price compared to yesterday's.\" </p> <p>His ambitions for the company include the growth of its internet operations, although he cautions: \"I don't believe any of us involved believe all the hype [about the web], much of which is clearly unsustainable. We see the internet as helping us protect and develop our existing franchises and as another way of supplying information to people and services to commercial customers. Whether it is a way of making money is certainly less clear than 12 months ago. It won't replace the profit stream from newspapers, absolutely not, but it is a way of exploiting our strengths. There is a lot of merit in working with television and radio companies to deliver the content of our papers, for example, and to work [with them] on internet projects.\" </p> <p>There are those who will consider Graf's faith in his journalists' essential decency the height of naivety, but he is nothing but realistic about the future of the national press in an increasingly difficult market. \"If you ask me whether in 10 years' time there will be the same number of titles, I [would say] I would be surprised. In their present form, I think it will be difficult for them all to survive. But, then, I don't think there will be the same number of companies in the TV industry. Or in the radio industry. Life will change.\" But will Trinity Mirror still be publishing the same number of national titles? \"I see no reason why we won't be.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Bill Hagerty is a former deputy editor of the Daily Mirror and, subsequently, editor of the People.

      "bodyText": "Like his predecessor as chief executive of what is now Trinity Mirror newspapers, Philip Graf is an Ulsterman. But this particular Northern Irishman is not only ready to laugh at the slightest provocation, but is affable and self-effacing. Nationality apart, there is no resemblance between Philip Graf and David Montgomery, whom Graf succeeded in the Canary Wharf hot seat. When the skeletal, domineering Montgomery smiles, you can almost hear ice splintering. But jollity and the lack of it is just one of the many differences. It is a fair bet that the name of Montgomery would produce venom from some who have had dealings with him, but it is rare to find anyone with a bad word to say about Graf. Painstakingly careful over his replies, Graf never shirks answering a question but the minefield through which he appears to think he is tiptoeing during this interview gets even more dangerous when Piers Morgan and the City Slickers are discussed. Asked if he was concerned about the DTI investigation into the shares affair, Graf told me: \"I don't believe they will find anything untoward. If they do, we'll have to review the situation, but I really don't think they will find anything as far as Piers is concerned. I think the PCC was very clear about what he did, which was ill-judged [the PCC found that Morgan had \"fallen short of the high professional standards\" demanded by its code]. The matter was actually dealt with very quickly, before that report came out. \"The Slickers [Anil Bhoyrul and James Hipwell] went through a proper, careful disciplinary procedure in which I was not involved and were fired. As far as I am concerned, the issue has been dealt with, unless something remarkable, unexpected and new emerges.\" But what of the internal emails published by the Sunday Times, which the paper suggested indicated that the editor should have been aware the Slickers would be recommending Viglen shares the morning after he bought them? These emails had not, apparently, been disclosed to the PCC. Surely this was damaging for Morgan and the company? \"No, the email was not shown to the PCC. The PCC was not investigating the company. It was Piers Morgan who gave evidence to the PCC, not the company, so we didn't show them any documents.\" And the email in which Morgan referred to a discussion he had with Bhoyrul on \"Viglen day\" about the merits of the editor selling other shares in order to buy Viglen - was it conceivable that such a conversation could have taken place without the following morning's pro-Viglen story being mentioned? \"We've never denied that they had spoken about Viglen, but that email does not show that they talked about Viglen that day. It had appeared in the City Slickers column on several occasions, remember.\" Another email revealed, as the Sunday Times put it, Morgan's appetite for investment and the occasional free gift: does not this not indicate embarrassing greed on the part of the editor of the group's flagship title? \"If you are saying, was it a desire to exploit his position to make lots of money, well, I stand by the fact that the pattern of behaviour was a foolish pattern, not a greedy pattern.\" The only child of a Belfast bakery foreman of German extraction, Philip Graf was educated at Methodist College, Belfast, and then Cambridge, where he read law. The Belfast Telegraph came into the family home every day. After university, he got his opportunity in the newspaper industry with Thomson Regional Newspapers, before returning to Belfast and the Thomson-owned Telegraph, where he became group circulation and marketing controller (he was \"pretty cross\" when, two decades later, the Monopolies Commission forced Trinity-Mirror to sell it after the merger). He next joined Trinity in Liverpool, rising to chief executive in 1993. The acquisition of the Thomson group in 1995 moved Trinity into the big league. Graf recalls: \"It was clear company policy that we would go beyond regional newspapers, but where we would go was a question we constantly worked at. [Then] It became clear the Mirror was a possibility.\" In what, to some City observers, seemed an audacious move - MGN was much the bigger of the two companies - Trinity edged out Regional Independent Media and captured Mirror Group for \u00a31.24bn. Among the early casualties of the Trinity regime was L!ve TV. But, typically, Graf refuses to be horrid about Janet, Kelvin and topless darts. \"As a brand it had become damaged beyond repair, but I wouldn't criticise people for having a go at doing what they tried to do. It was unfortunate the way it turned out.\" Since the 1999 deal, he says, \"From a financial perspective, we've delivered the numbers we said we would deliver. In terms of taking the business forward, we are looking to step up our pace. Trinity Mirror is the leading regional publisher, which is very nice. Now we want to continue to develop our existing newspapers, but also look at how we can move the business by acquisition.\" (And by recently acquiring the Southnews papers for \u00a3284.6m, Trinity Mirror boosted the titles under Graf's control to 260). Was Trinity not tempted to enter the bidding for the Express, especially as the Daily Star and Sunday People would have made comfy bedfellows? \"No. We felt that to make a success of it in its particular competitive environment is always going to take a lot of money and effort.\" Does this mean Richard Desmond may have bitten off more than he possibly can chew? \"I am sure he has thought about that very carefully,\" says Graf, very carefully. \"He has certainly taken on a very formidable competitor in the DMGT [Daily Mail and General Trust]. They haven't messed about, have they?\" Desmond has talked of launching a Sunday version of the Daily Star. David Sullivan, proprietor of the Sport, has made similar noises about a new Sunday tabloid. The last thing Trinity Mirror needs, I suggested, were further challengers in a fiercely competitive national Sunday market, where the Sunday People and, to a lesser extent, the Sunday Mirror, trail further and further behind in the wake of the News of the World. \"If and when that situation arises we shall have to react appropriately,\" says Graf. \"The Sunday market is tough and I am not going to sit here and pretend I've got a solution for it. Social changes have transformed the British Sunday and made life tougher for, in particular, the Sunday red-tops. I think the Sunday Mirror has done well for us over the last couple of years. The Sunday People is a tougher challenge. Its rate of decline has slowed, but we've got to keep working at it.\" At the time of the first of my two long interviews with Graf, the ABC circulation figures for all three titles were disappointing and there was an even gloomier report from the National Readership Survey, showing a sharp drop for the Mirror and only a minor one for The Sun. \"It's the fundamental ABC performance of the paper over a certain amount of time that concerns me,\" he said, \"and I am very happy with what the Mirror has done in that respect.\" (The latest figures make unhappy reading for him, though: in February it was showing a 3.25% year-on-year decline). Nevertheless, 16 months down the road, the CEO is not dissatisfied. It has, however, been a bumpy journey, with Morgan coming perilously close to tumbling down a pothole and both Daily Record editor Martin Clarke (\"I'm afraid I'm unwilling to discuss the departure of Martin Clarke\") and Trinity Mirror's managing director of national titles Roger Eastoe falling by the wayside somewhat abruptly. He is, he agrees, more likely to wake in the middle of the night thinking of the Trinity Mirror share price than the Piers Morgan shares affair - \"Although I think about the share price as a reflection of the long-term health, future and prospects of the company, not today's share price compared to yesterday's.\" His ambitions for the company include the growth of its internet operations, although he cautions: \"I don't believe any of us involved believe all the hype [about the web], much of which is clearly unsustainable. We see the internet as helping us protect and develop our existing franchises and as another way of supplying information to people and services to commercial customers. Whether it is a way of making money is certainly less clear than 12 months ago. It won't replace the profit stream from newspapers, absolutely not, but it is a way of exploiting our strengths. There is a lot of merit in working with television and radio companies to deliver the content of our papers, for example, and to work [with them] on internet projects.\" There are those who will consider Graf's faith in his journalists' essential decency the height of naivety, but he is nothing but realistic about the future of the national press in an increasingly difficult market. \"If you ask me whether in 10 years' time there will be the same number of titles, I [would say] I would be surprised. In their present form, I think it will be difficult for them all to survive. But, then, I don't think there will be the same number of companies in the TV industry. Or in the radio industry. Life will change.\" But will Trinity Mirror still be publishing the same number of national titles? \"I see no reason why we won't be.\" \u0095 Bill Hagerty is a former deputy editor of the Daily Mirror and, subsequently, editor of the People.

      "body": "<p>It's a disturbing thought: the cute, designer-clad constant companion that spends hours of every day clamped to your hand suddenly turns out to be a KitKat salesman. </p> <p>Welcome to the dawning of a new advertising era, where mobile phone marketing is about to make the \"brand-in-the-hand\" dreams of marketers the world over come true. </p> <p>Nestl\u00e9 is launching KitKat-sponsored games on mobiles. McDonald's, American Express, <a href=\"http://www.lastminute.com\" target=\"_NEW\">lastminute.com</a> and even the Labour party have all started to target consumers through mobiles. </p> <p>Mobiles offer marketers the ultimate direct, personalised, time- and location-sensitive method of advertising. But this method of marketing also carries the risk of brands becoming unwelcome intruders in people's lives and presents a dilemma over direct and unmonitored advertising to children. </p> <p>Any consumer backlash could damage the advertiser and ricochet on to the mobile network operator. And if consumers are unhappy about the content of branded text messages, or don't want to receive ads, who do they complain to? The medium does not fall under the remit of any established regulator. </p> <p>But the bandwagon is rolling. Mobile phone network operators - anxious to recoup the \u00a322bn spent on 3G network licences - handset manufacturers, internet service providers, website owners, the ad industry, the nascent mobile marketing industry and advertisers all have a vested interest in making mobile marketing work. </p> <p>The European m-commerce market is set to soar in value from \u00a3201m in 1998 to \u00a314.3bn by 2003, with advertising accounting for almost a quarter of that revenue, according to internet investor Durlacher. Even conservative ad revenue forecasts are not to be scoffed at. Forrester Research estimates Europe's mobile ad market will be worth \u00a31.8bn by 2005. </p> <p>A new advertising model is needed to establish how to create, evaluate and charge for wireless campaigns, alongside discovering what consumers are willing to accept and pay for. </p> <p>The opportunity to send personalised messages direct to consumers - ones they are almost guaranteed to look at - could not have come at a better time for brand owners. </p> <p>In a fragmenting media marketplace companies are desperately seeking new ways of getting their message across, particularly to the youth market, the most avid users of text messaging. </p> <p>Companies, including Coca-Cola, are pulling back from TV advertising and ploughing resources in to marketing which \"adds value\" to consumers' lives: music, sport and entertainment sponsorships, viral marketing and initiatives which allow the consumer to interact with the brand. </p> <p>A recent two-month trial by US mobile marketing network WindWire, involving seven wireless websites, 14 advertisers and six ad agencies with 22 campaigns and 105 ads, gives a taste of the allure of wireless for advertisers. </p> <p>The campaigns inspired click-through and call-through rates up to 15%, a 46% ad recall rate and a 24%-86% likelihood to purchase after seeing the ads. It also showed 86% of consumers want free or ad-subsidised content and that 64% are concerned about privacy issues. </p> <p>The figures are driving commitment from the ad industry. Carat, one of the world's biggest media buying networks, was involved in the WindWire trials. </p> <p>Doug Flynn, chief executive of Carat's parent company Aegis, says: \"Mobile marketing is still embryonic. But it does have applications. Developments such as Vodafone's Vizzavi, which offers one internet portal across all devices, will start to cause a shift of dollars.\" </p> <p>Charles Vallance, managing director of Vizzavi's ad agency WCRS, says mobile marketing will be commonplace by the end of this year: \"It will be huge as a medium. It is the most personalised medium that has ever existed. But a new media protocol needs to be set up to decide who sells, who are the contractors, who are the regulators.\" </p> <p>People are targeted by their personal preferences - such as leisure activities, shopping patterns and location - by segmenting information-rich databases. </p> <p>Ad agencies, just getting to grips with internet and interactive TV advertising, now have to learn to create concise mobile ad campaigns with only 160 characters to play with. As the mobile technology develops, so will the complexity of campaigns. Dedicated mobile ad creative teams will begin to appear in agencies. </p> <p>WCRS clients are interested in using mobiles in their campaigns, but are wary: \"The main issue is not letting it backfire by inundating people with messages.

      "bodyText": "It's a disturbing thought: the cute, designer-clad constant companion that spends hours of every day clamped to your hand suddenly turns out to be a KitKat salesman. Welcome to the dawning of a new advertising era, where mobile phone marketing is about to make the \"brand-in-the-hand\" dreams of marketers the world over come true. Nestl\u00e9 is launching KitKat-sponsored games on mobiles. McDonald's, American Express, lastminute.com and even the Labour party have all started to target consumers through mobiles. Mobiles offer marketers the ultimate direct, personalised, time- and location-sensitive method of advertising. But this method of marketing also carries the risk of brands becoming unwelcome intruders in people's lives and presents a dilemma over direct and unmonitored advertising to children. Any consumer backlash could damage the advertiser and ricochet on to the mobile network operator. And if consumers are unhappy about the content of branded text messages, or don't want to receive ads, who do they complain to? The medium does not fall under the remit of any established regulator. But the bandwagon is rolling. Mobile phone network operators - anxious to recoup the \u00a322bn spent on 3G network licences - handset manufacturers, internet service providers, website owners, the ad industry, the nascent mobile marketing industry and advertisers all have a vested interest in making mobile marketing work. The European m-commerce market is set to soar in value from \u00a3201m in 1998 to \u00a314.3bn by 2003, with advertising accounting for almost a quarter of that revenue, according to internet investor Durlacher. Even conservative ad revenue forecasts are not to be scoffed at. Forrester Research estimates Europe's mobile ad market will be worth \u00a31.8bn by 2005. A new advertising model is needed to establish how to create, evaluate and charge for wireless campaigns, alongside discovering what consumers are willing to accept and pay for. The opportunity to send personalised messages direct to consumers - ones they are almost guaranteed to look at - could not have come at a better time for brand owners. In a fragmenting media marketplace companies are desperately seeking new ways of getting their message across, particularly to the youth market, the most avid users of text messaging. Companies, including Coca-Cola, are pulling back from TV advertising and ploughing resources in to marketing which \"adds value\" to consumers' lives: music, sport and entertainment sponsorships, viral marketing and initiatives which allow the consumer to interact with the brand. A recent two-month trial by US mobile marketing network WindWire, involving seven wireless websites, 14 advertisers and six ad agencies with 22 campaigns and 105 ads, gives a taste of the allure of wireless for advertisers. The campaigns inspired click-through and call-through rates up to 15%, a 46% ad recall rate and a 24%-86% likelihood to purchase after seeing the ads. It also showed 86% of consumers want free or ad-subsidised content and that 64% are concerned about privacy issues. The figures are driving commitment from the ad industry. Carat, one of the world's biggest media buying networks, was involved in the WindWire trials. Doug Flynn, chief executive of Carat's parent company Aegis, says: \"Mobile marketing is still embryonic. But it does have applications. Developments such as Vodafone's Vizzavi, which offers one internet portal across all devices, will start to cause a shift of dollars.\" Charles Vallance, managing director of Vizzavi's ad agency WCRS, says mobile marketing will be commonplace by the end of this year: \"It will be huge as a medium. It is the most personalised medium that has ever existed. But a new media protocol needs to be set up to decide who sells, who are the contractors, who are the regulators.\" People are targeted by their personal preferences - such as leisure activities, shopping patterns and location - by segmenting information-rich databases. Ad agencies, just getting to grips with internet and interactive TV advertising, now have to learn to create concise mobile ad campaigns with only 160 characters to play with. As the mobile technology develops, so will the complexity of campaigns. Dedicated mobile ad creative teams will begin to appear in agencies. WCRS clients are interested in using mobiles in their campaigns, but are wary: \"The main issue is not letting it backfire by inundating people with messages. Do you get people to say yes to messages or do you pump them out regardless?\" says Vallance. He is convinced interesting and relevant ads which offer discounts or entertainment value will succeed. Ex-DJ Peter Powell's multimedia company Worldpop is staking its success on offering entertaining, revenue-generating digital marketing. \"This medium is not just about whacking out text messages, it's interactive. Its about getting a response with consumers ringing a phone line or looking at a website,\" says Geoff Smith, Worldpop joint managing director. Worldpop is testing sponsored mobile phone pop quiz games, will send ads and special offers with event news to ravers at this year's Ericsson@homelands dance music festival and will run a similar service to Ibiza clubbers in the summer, as it did last year. It knows the music preferences of its 4.5m-strong database, down to who likes which drum and bass maestro. British Airways, BT, Woolworth's, Durex and Kodak have tapped in to that information so far. \"We're not making any extravagant claims of mobile marketing taking over from TV or print, but increasingly we are producing campaigns linking traditional media with mobiles,\" says Smith. One of the main benefits for marketers is that mobile campaigns are measurable, they can be tracked and the cost of customer acquisition can be calculated. According to mobile marketing company 12snap, text messaging campaigns result in a response rate 15% higher than traditional direct marketing campaigns. McDonald's is launching a year-long text messaging campaign in a joint venture with 12snap. The burger chain's German marketing chief Jeffrey T Wahl says: \"We want to reach our customers through the most direct means - namely their mobile phones. We are convinced that the mobile will become an inte grated component of the marketing mix in the future.\" But targeting young people with ads for burgers or anything else courts controversy. Sweden and Greece already have restraints on advertising to children, and ads that go direct to children's mobiles unmonitored by parents will cause concern. \"There is so much room for abuse,\" says 12snap managing director Anne de Kerckhove. \"We are not comfortable targeting under-16s and payment methods stop under-18s taking part. But we have to discuss what the ethical dilemmas are and how much we can push a direct relationship without parental consent.\" A set of self-regulatory rules to govern use, and potential abuse, of marketing by mobile companies have been drawn up by new industry body the Wireless Marketing Association, supported by Orange, BTCellnet and Vodafone. But the WMA's voluntary code of practice is unenforceable, non-members cannot be controlled and there is no external regulatory body.

The only possible result of culling 130 journalists and eliminating 15 library staff will be to hasten the demise of his papers. </p> <p>Despite having the supposed backing of his editors, they know what I know and what the rest of Fleet Street knows: the three titles are already understaffed and, after the cuts, they will not be able to compete at any level with their rivals. </p> <p>In order to justify what the Press Gazette properly calls a \"bloodbath\", Desmond's spinners have also been circulating a totally false tale about staffing on other papers.

A further 100 journalists across the country work for Associated's free title, Metro. The Mirror has 344 journalists; the Sunday Mirror has 99; and the People has 97. That's a total of 540. </p> <p>To put that in perspective, the Daily Star has 106 journalists, and the Daily and Sunday Express between them have 404, a total across the three titles of 510. After the cuts, that total will come down to 380, which clearly doesn't come close to either the Mail or Mirror papers.

The Scottish office will be devastated, leaving at best a third of the current staff, and there will be the merest tokenism, if that, in the regions. </p> <p>No wonder the National Union of Journalists' official, Jeremy Dear, says with masterly understatement: \"We don't believe these cuts are necessary or desirable if Mr Desmond is truly interested in restoring his papers to their rightful position.\" </p> <p>For the first time in many years, even non-union journalists will agree with that NUJ assessment. One irony of this episode is that Desmond may well bring a largely quiescent union, which has 250 members at Express Newspapers, back to life. Old-style militant talk was being muttered at a chapel meeting on Friday attended by more than 150 people which resolved to organise a ballot for industrial action with just four votes against and 11 abstentions. But this is the beginning of a lengthy process which will not be concluded until July 15. First, there will be a 90-day statutory consultation period, which doesn't get under way until the beginning of next month. Then comes a month-long consultation between management and those who have opted, or been selected, for redundancy. </p> <p>One fascinating aspect, as always, will be to see who and how many decide to go under the initial voluntary redundancy offer. Express editor Chris Williams - who must surely be downcast, having expected cuts but not of this order - will not allow anyone he thinks crucial to his team to take the money and run. This will prevent the more talented people, who would most easily find jobs elsewhere, from leaving. It also means, inevitably, that in the end management will have to demand mandatory redundancies. At that point, the NUJ will find itself in direct confrontation with Desmond. </p> <p>Doubtless, there will be many twists and turns as negotiations continue. Whatever the eventual outcome of that industrial trial of strength, it is easier to predict the future for the Expresses. Their sales have been falling for years, and there has been a noticeable acceleration since Desmond took over in November, with the daily title losing 84,000 copies a day in four months. The Sunday Express has lost 76,000 in the same period. Desmond has, let it be said, invested by upping the pagination on all his titles at a time when newsprint costs have risen. He has also spent large sums on television promotion for the Sunday title and the Daily Star, which has added 25,000 sales since November. </p> <p>Unlike Clive Hollick before him, who cut costs without investing in the product, Desmond has probably spent \u00a315m on the Star alone and several million on the Sunday title with its extra section. That's why the editors and senior journalists have not rebelled in spite of their upset at the need to cut jobs. They might think Desmond inexperienced, and they are less than happy at his nightly editorial interventions, but they do think their new owner is well motivated. </p> <p>That's fine, of course, as far as it goes. But it doesn't come anywhere near to convincing me that Desmond's strategy of reducing his journalistic staff will work in the end.

The Daily Star, right from its launch in 1978, has always been a rough-and-ready red-top tabloid, biting away at the northern heels of the Sun, particularly on Merseyside, and picking up a fraction of the old-style Daily Mirror audience. </p> <p>It is brash, brazen and a bit bloody-minded, but it can never truly hope to be anything other than an annoyance to its competitors, which still have the kind of newspaper credibility (I kid you not!) that the Star cannot match. The Expresses are different. In the new post-Rosie Boycott format, they are lively, shameless, showbusiness packages, well-designed, with bags of pace. But the slight erosion of heavyweight material is putting in jeopardy the papers' claim to being taken seriously. The entertainment-based content may well attract new readers in the short term, but it will alienate much of the traditional audience and, over time, will irritate the newcomers too. </p> <p>There is nothing to worry about yet. Comparing Friday's Express and Mail, both 96 pages, the Mail carried slightly more serious stories in the first half and certainly gave greater weight to non-celebrity-based news reports. But a swingeing staff cut, regardless of how adept the senior editors might be at covering all the bases, will reduce the Express's chance to deal with serious stories in sufficient depth. If it is also forced to rely on the news agencies for all its stories and background material, then it will be beaten regularly by other papers. </p> <p>Newsgathering is not about reaction. There is no substitute for having a person out on the road, knocking on the doors, following up tips, digging away. A paper that sacrifices its reporting capability in order to spend more on pictures of a super-model is not worth paying for. </p> <p>I suspect that Richard Desmond knows nothing of this and cares even less.

      "body": "<p><strong> Friday December 1</strong> </p> <p> Cold Feet series three is almost at an end, Christmas is coming and I'm looking forward to my first holiday in six months. Stumbling into the regular Granada publicity meeting expecting the usual perfunctory round-up of Barrymore specials, Audience Withs and Richard and Judy crises, I sit down to buff my nails. But I am wrenched from my end-of-year torpor by a new programme on the agenda - and amazingly, it's up for grabs. A long-repressed desire to be Phil Oakey's love-child resurfaces as the head of press describes this new series as the bastard offspring of Big Brother and The Monkees. Before you can say Hit Me Baby One More Time, Popstars is mine. </p> <p> <strong> Monday December 4</strong> </p> <p> LWT's entertainment chief, Nigel Lythgoe, has spent the summer searching the country for wannabe pop talent with former Spice Girls PR Nicki Chapman and Polydor A&amp;R director Paul Adam. The results of their search is known only to a few production staff and the aspirant pop stars' immediate families. In a procedure of which MI5 would be proud, I'm made to sign a confidentiality agreement before I'm even allowed to see photos of the chosen five. All we have to do now is keep them under wraps for a couple of months until they are revealed midway through the series. A hard task, but one that LWT's stringent security plan should cover. </p> <p>Not for long. Freelance journalist Paul Scott is on the phone just moments later. He knows the names, ages, home towns, current whereabouts and gym membership details of the band members. It is no longer a case of whether the press will find out who's in the band, but how long before they do. </p> <p>We need to keep the publicity pot boiling without giving too much away, and with billboards across the country proclaiming \"Nigel Pick Me\", what better distraction for the press than a 50-something TV executive with a cartoon on-screen identity and a bad haircut. Nasty Nigel is born. </p> <p> <strong> Monday January 15 </strong> </p> <p>The show is on air and causing a media sensation, DJs, TV presenters and columnists all have an opinion on Nigel's audition techniques and \"Nasty Nigel\" is a household name. Nigel achieves a lifetime's ambition when he appears on the cover of Media Guardian, but as the tabloid hysteria increases, I begin to worry about the nature of the pact we have signed. The extent of Nigel's celebrity status becomes apparent when Top of the Pops magazine demands that he reviews the month's singles. </p> <p> <strong> Tuesday January 16</strong> </p> <p> The world is going completely mad. I am woken at 7.30am by Kiss FM which gives me 10 seconds' notice before putting me live on air. Either I take them to meet the band or they reveal the band's address. My offer to sleep with DJ Bam Bam as an alternative gets a lukewarm response. </p> <p> <strong> Wednesday January 17</strong> </p> <p> Such is the show's zeitgeist appeal that even the losers are cover stories. Heat magazine wants Big Claire from Glasgow and Darius \"the pain in the Arias\". (Copyright, Daily Star.) But there's a problem: Claire's bosses at Kwik-Fit won't allow her to take an extended lunchbreak - her moment of fame is slipping through my fingers. We even offer to pay Kwik-Fit for lost income, but they don't bite. But a last-ditch compromise is agreed and we do the shoot in her works canteen as her colleagues look on. Fame costs and here's where you start paying. </p> <p> <strong> Friday January 19 </strong> </p> <p> Amid the publicity whirlwind, a crisis emerges. It's increasingly clear that we have a leak in the camp. Someone is spilling the beans - too many tabloids seem to know intimate details of where the band are living, where they are from and who they've slept with. Most alarmingly, they know about the Kym Situation [that she has two children]. A steady stream of \"exclusive\" stories are offered to keep the five's names out of the papers until the band is revealed onscreen. The tabloids agree readily: a revealed band does not sell papers, a real-life soap opera does. </p> <p> <strong> Saturday January 20</strong> </p> <p> Things appear to be under control and after a hugely successful webcast with Nasty Nigel, we retire to a West End bar for a celebratory drink. But I'm only two sips into a pina colada when the phone goes - the Sunday People is planning to break ranks. My increasingly desperate attempts to persuade the paper's editor to keep the Popstars secret fall on deaf ears. Under a banner headline on page 11, Noel, Danny, Kym, Suzanne and Myleene are revealed to the nation. Arse. </p> <p> <strong> Sunday January 21</strong> </p> <p> The band are gutted. Kym threatens to nut Paul Scott. I sympathise with the response but professional integrity prevents me from endorsing this course of action. Instead, we stick to the line that 10 hopefuls are still under consideration and the final five have not been chosen. It would be an unmitigated disaster if the line-up was to change but it is still a remote possibility, and there are five replacements at the ready in the highly unlikely event that one of the chosen band should walk out. </p> <p> <strong> Monday January 22 </strong> </p> <p>A large number of journalists now know the final line-up and are using this as ammunition.

      "bodyText": "Friday December 1 Cold Feet series three is almost at an end, Christmas is coming and I'm looking forward to my first holiday in six months. Stumbling into the regular Granada publicity meeting expecting the usual perfunctory round-up of Barrymore specials, Audience Withs and Richard and Judy crises, I sit down to buff my nails. But I am wrenched from my end-of-year torpor by a new programme on the agenda - and amazingly, it's up for grabs. A long-repressed desire to be Phil Oakey's love-child resurfaces as the head of press describes this new series as the bastard offspring of Big Brother and The Monkees. Before you can say Hit Me Baby One More Time, Popstars is mine. Monday December 4 LWT's entertainment chief, Nigel Lythgoe, has spent the summer searching the country for wannabe pop talent with former Spice Girls PR Nicki Chapman and Polydor A&amp;R director Paul Adam. The results of their search is known only to a few production staff and the aspirant pop stars' immediate families. In a procedure of which MI5 would be proud, I'm made to sign a confidentiality agreement before I'm even allowed to see photos of the chosen five. All we have to do now is keep them under wraps for a couple of months until they are revealed midway through the series. A hard task, but one that LWT's stringent security plan should cover. Not for long. Freelance journalist Paul Scott is on the phone just moments later. He knows the names, ages, home towns, current whereabouts and gym membership details of the band members. It is no longer a case of whether the press will find out who's in the band, but how long before they do. We need to keep the publicity pot boiling without giving too much away, and with billboards across the country proclaiming \"Nigel Pick Me\", what better distraction for the press than a 50-something TV executive with a cartoon on-screen identity and a bad haircut. Nasty Nigel is born. Monday January 15 The show is on air and causing a media sensation, DJs, TV presenters and columnists all have an opinion on Nigel's audition techniques and \"Nasty Nigel\" is a household name. Nigel achieves a lifetime's ambition when he appears on the cover of Media Guardian, but as the tabloid hysteria increases, I begin to worry about the nature of the pact we have signed. The extent of Nigel's celebrity status becomes apparent when Top of the Pops magazine demands that he reviews the month's singles. Tuesday January 16 The world is going completely mad. I am woken at 7.30am by Kiss FM which gives me 10 seconds' notice before putting me live on air. Either I take them to meet the band or they reveal the band's address. My offer to sleep with DJ Bam Bam as an alternative gets a lukewarm response. Wednesday January 17 Such is the show's zeitgeist appeal that even the losers are cover stories. Heat magazine wants Big Claire from Glasgow and Darius \"the pain in the Arias\". (Copyright, Daily Star.) But there's a problem: Claire's bosses at Kwik-Fit won't allow her to take an extended lunchbreak - her moment of fame is slipping through my fingers. We even offer to pay Kwik-Fit for lost income, but they don't bite. But a last-ditch compromise is agreed and we do the shoot in her works canteen as her colleagues look on. Fame costs and here's where you start paying. Friday January 19 Amid the publicity whirlwind, a crisis emerges. It's increasingly clear that we have a leak in the camp. Someone is spilling the beans - too many tabloids seem to know intimate details of where the band are living, where they are from and who they've slept with. Most alarmingly, they know about the Kym Situation [that she has two children]. A steady stream of \"exclusive\" stories are offered to keep the five's names out of the papers until the band is revealed onscreen. The tabloids agree readily: a revealed band does not sell papers, a real-life soap opera does. Saturday January 20 Things appear to be under control and after a hugely successful webcast with Nasty Nigel, we retire to a West End bar for a celebratory drink. But I'm only two sips into a pina colada when the phone goes - the Sunday People is planning to break ranks. My increasingly desperate attempts to persuade the paper's editor to keep the Popstars secret fall on deaf ears. Under a banner headline on page 11, Noel, Danny, Kym, Suzanne and Myleene are revealed to the nation. Arse. Sunday January 21 The band are gutted. Kym threatens to nut Paul Scott. I sympathise with the response but professional integrity prevents me from endorsing this course of action. Instead, we stick to the line that 10 hopefuls are still under consideration and the final five have not been chosen. It would be an unmitigated disaster if the line-up was to change but it is still a remote possibility, and there are five replacements at the ready in the highly unlikely event that one of the chosen band should walk out. Monday January 22 A large number of journalists now know the final line-up and are using this as ammunition. My sidekick, Joe Stroud, and I must provide a steady stream of tabloid fodder to keep the hounds at bay. It is a pact with the devil - when the Sun demands six double-page spreads in a week, I fear for my soul. Nigel, Darius, Claire and a host of other wannabes step forward to fill the void. Tuesday January 23 Meanwhile, Kiss FM are still on my case. They want an interview with the band and are prepared to go to any lengths to get one. Their powers of investigative journalism did not stop with finding out the band line-up. They know my home address, my parents' home address, where I went to university - and have dredged up details of a particularly embarrassing medical complaint from my teens of which my mother is, even now, unaware. Martyr-like I decide that if the world is to find out why I was christened Buster Gonad at college, then it is a price I am prepared to pay. I don't answer the phone before 8am ever again. Thursday January 25 Taking a break from the maelstrom, Nigel decides to hobnob with the glitterati at the South Bank Show awards. Amongst the great and good of the artistic community, the man who brought Ice Warriors to ITV is mobbed by journalists asking how he is coping with his new-found fame. While Nigel is besieged, Dame Antoinette Sibley looks on bemused. Friday January 26 Things are getting out of hand when a meeting with ITV network bosses is interrupted by Sunday Mirror hacks, who have brought the woman who beat Nigel in a childhood tap-dancing contest 40 years ago down from Liverpool to London for a Tearful Reunion. That'll teach him to tell family anecdotes to Media Guardian. Saturday March 3 The show is going stellar and the Popstars also-rans want a slice of the action.

Monday March 5 Finally, we have made it to the point in the show when the five are officially revealed and it's time to show them off at a press conference at Heathrow. They sing, they charm, they head off to shoot their first five magazine covers and I breathe a sigh of relief. Monday March 19 For the first time in weeks, the LWT phone lines are not in a state of meltdown.

      "bodyText": "A former nurse was in a coma yesterday after being given an insulin overdose following a liver transplant operation. Teresita Cruz, 56, was recovering after surgery at the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham when the accident happened.

In the restaurant, the children cannot wait to get down from their chairs and race about outside. </p> <p>Thirty miles north of Dublin, set in 300 acres of lush Co Meath countryside with a private beach, Mosney holiday camp has given a warm welcome to hundreds of thousands of Irish families since 1948. But none of the 300 residents on this bracing day is Irish, nor has any a home to go back to. </p> <p>There are 26 nationalities, in this limbo of brightly coloured chalets and dance halls, more used to glamorous granny and lovely legs contests than the competition to see who will win the right to stay in the Republic of Ireland. </p> <p>An average of 1,000 asylum seekers from more than 140 countries enter each month, pushing Ireland to near top of the European Union refugee league. The combined outlay of the departments of justice, welfare, health and education on the crisis topped IR\u00a3100m last year. </p> <p>\"There are far more direct flights from Africa to Dublin than there were. And there are no controls between Great Britain and here, so if you come into Dover or wherever, you can simply carry on to Ireland,\" said Colette Morey, from the justice department. Permanent residency is granted to less than 18%, who have to prove persecution in their country of origin; the process can take more than a year. In the meantime, the government is housing 3,500 people in 75 locations; Mosney, which will eventually take 500, is the biggest. </p> <p>\"Up until 1999, most stayed in central Dublin,\" said Ms Morey. \"Christmas 1998, there were children sleeping rough on the streets. The dispersal programme, which started in November 1999, has been a big change for rural Ireland, and a massive learning curve for us.\" </p> <p>There have been racist incidents, but Ms Morey said that most communities came to accept the newcomers. \"The foreigners also tended to try and get back to the city, even though they'd be leaving for nothing short of hovels.\" The asylum seekers cannot work unless they are granted refugee status. </p> <p>The booming economy means there is no shortage of jobs, although many well-educated incomers do menial tasks. But Ms Morey said the real problem was housing. \"There is a big shortfall, even for our own population,\" she said. \"We are coping but if the numbers go up, it's hard to know where we could find roofs to put over their heads.\" As the traditional seaside holiday fights for survival against overseas packages, Mosney, which in its 1950s and 1960s heydays had more than 50,000 visitors and 160,000 day trippers in a 14-week season, seems a good way to cope. The land could have raised tens of millions on the property development market, but managing director Phelim McCloskey is glad his five-year deal with the government gives job security to the 60 staff. </p> <p>Heating has been installed in the chalets, there is a regular train service to Dublin and free buses to nearby Drogheda, and satellite dishes and internet services so the residents watch their home stations and email relatives. </p> <p>There is a rulebook, no drugs, no soliciting, no begging, and residents must sign a daily register. But Mr McCloskey said some restrictions were necessary in any community, and by and large, the visitors were free to come and go. \"It's not a prison,\" hesaid. \"People go shopping and the children go to school in nearby towns, which has helped ease local worries.\" While quite a number of residents are graduates with excellent English, Mr McCloskey said English classes had helped bring people together. </p> <p>Many families have sad and extraordinary stories about how they came to be there, and their futures are far from certain. Mariam and Bayo Adinyi, engineers from Nigeria, have been at Mosney two weeks, with their daughters, Nana, eight, and 18-month-old Wuraola. Bayo's tribe wanted to elect him religious chief but they practised human sacrifice, and the family, who are Christian, ran away in terror. </p> <p>Mariam, who had to leave her 10-year-old daughter with her elderly mother, met an Irish missionary who helped her get out. In the panic, she got separated from Bayo, but the couple were reunited by chance in Dublin. \"Our lives were at risk and we had to flee,\" she said. \"But I miss my daughter so much. I never left her before and I'm so worried about her. </p> <p>\"I don't mind living with other people, it broadens your views and makes you realise you're not the only one with problems - but it is boring here. We just eat, sleep and watch TV. In Nigeria, we had our own house and good jobs in the city. We'd just like to get work and send our children to school.\" </p> <p>Elana, 24, a Romanian, gave birth to seven-week-old Kevin at Mosney. In Romania she had been halfway through a degree but gave up due to lack of money; her husband, Nicolae, could not get a job because he lacked correct papers. </p> <p>She was already pregnant when she found out that a baby born in Ireland would get Irish citizenship, and the couple found a lorry driver willing to take them. \"I was eight months pregnant and so anxious to get here in time,\" she said. \"It was a very long, uncomfortable journey. He left us off outside Dublin. We just had a change of clothes and a few pounds but we would have been penniless at home. This is my mother's first grandchild and I cried every time I spoke to her on the phone.\" </p> <p>The couple have been allocated a house in Waterford, so their child will be brought up in the country where he was born. </p> <p>\"I am a little bit scared about starting somewhere new, but thank God we are here and we will be able to make a life for ourselves,\" she said.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Peter Bielenberg, who has died aged 89, was a member of the internal German resistance to Nazism and was sent to a forced-labour camp after the abortive July 1944 coup against Hitler. This story provided the climax of The Past Is Myself (1968), the bestselling autobiography of his British wife Christabel, who lived through the war in Germany.</p> <p>Bielenberg was active in the Kreisau circle, which became the focus of German upper-class and intellectual opposition to the Nazi movement. It was his close association with Adam von Trott zu Solz, one of its heroes, that led to Bielenberg's arrest and imprisonment without trial. Despite the moral and physical courage of such individuals, the opposition to Hitler - once the left had been suppressed and the Wehrmacht seduced with prospects of expansion and conquest - was not only modest but had much to be modest about.</p> <p>The objections of the upper-class opposition to Hitler were initially more moral and aesthetic than practical, though they were seen as no less dangerous. The dissidents despised the petty-bourgeois respectability in which the Nazis clothed their excesses. Initially, the Kreisau circle's principal aim, fatuous in retrospect, was to persuade likeminded Wehrmacht officers and influential foreign, especially British, sympathisers to warn Hitler off.</p> <p>Only in 1943, when it became obvious that Germany could not win the second world war, did the resisters accept that they might as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb, and turned their minds to armed revolt. But, in July 1944, Claus von Stauffenberg's bomb failed to kill Hitler.</p> <p>Bielenberg was born in Hamburg, the son of the head of a prosperous law firm, in whose footsteps he was meant to follow. He was only 20 when he met the well-connected, Anglo-Irish Christabel Burton, nearly three years his senior, who had given up an Oxford scholarship to study singing in Hamburg. Ironically, Bielenberg, who had been awarded a scholarship to the United States, lost it in 1933, when the Americans expressed a preference for a representative of the \"new Germany\" - a Nazi.</p> <p>Both tall and elegant, Bielenberg and Christabel danced exceptionally well together, and married in September 1934, despite misgivings in both their families. The new Frau Bielenberg thereupon chose to become a German citizen by naturalisation.</p> <p>In an early example of their blithe, upper-class assumption that it was not what you knew but who you knew that mattered - an instinct often proved right, even under Nazism - Bielenberg wangled an attachment to the German embassy in London as part of his work experience as a trainee lawyer. He and his wife then moved to Hamburg, until he got his law doctorate in 1937 and joined the family firm.</p> <p>The following year, he secured the acquittal of a socialist on a charge of distributing illegal pamphlets - but was shocked when his client was arrested and taken away immediately afterwards. At that point, the couple wanted to emigrate to neutral Eire, but Trott dissuaded them.</p> <p>Instead, early in 1939, they moved to Berlin, where Bielenberg, with extreme distaste, joined the Nazi party in order to take up a civil-service post. During a holiday in England that August, he visited his wife's highly-placed contacts - she was related to the Harmsworths, making her a niece of the press Lords Northcliffe and Rothermere.

      "bodyText": "Peter Bielenberg, who has died aged 89, was a member of the internal German resistance to Nazism and was sent to a forced-labour camp after the abortive July 1944 coup against Hitler. This story provided the climax of The Past Is Myself (1968), the bestselling autobiography of his British wife Christabel, who lived through the war in Germany. Bielenberg was active in the Kreisau circle, which became the focus of German upper-class and intellectual opposition to the Nazi movement. It was his close association with Adam von Trott zu Solz, one of its heroes, that led to Bielenberg's arrest and imprisonment without trial. Despite the moral and physical courage of such individuals, the opposition to Hitler - once the left had been suppressed and the Wehrmacht seduced with prospects of expansion and conquest - was not only modest but had much to be modest about. The objections of the upper-class opposition to Hitler were initially more moral and aesthetic than practical, though they were seen as no less dangerous. The dissidents despised the petty-bourgeois respectability in which the Nazis clothed their excesses. Initially, the Kreisau circle's principal aim, fatuous in retrospect, was to persuade likeminded Wehrmacht officers and influential foreign, especially British, sympathisers to warn Hitler off. Only in 1943, when it became obvious that Germany could not win the second world war, did the resisters accept that they might as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb, and turned their minds to armed revolt. But, in July 1944, Claus von Stauffenberg's bomb failed to kill Hitler. Bielenberg was born in Hamburg, the son of the head of a prosperous law firm, in whose footsteps he was meant to follow. He was only 20 when he met the well-connected, Anglo-Irish Christabel Burton, nearly three years his senior, who had given up an Oxford scholarship to study singing in Hamburg. Ironically, Bielenberg, who had been awarded a scholarship to the United States, lost it in 1933, when the Americans expressed a preference for a representative of the \"new Germany\" - a Nazi. Both tall and elegant, Bielenberg and Christabel danced exceptionally well together, and married in September 1934, despite misgivings in both their families. The new Frau Bielenberg thereupon chose to become a German citizen by naturalisation. In an early example of their blithe, upper-class assumption that it was not what you knew but who you knew that mattered - an instinct often proved right, even under Nazism - Bielenberg wangled an attachment to the German embassy in London as part of his work experience as a trainee lawyer. He and his wife then moved to Hamburg, until he got his law doctorate in 1937 and joined the family firm. The following year, he secured the acquittal of a socialist on a charge of distributing illegal pamphlets - but was shocked when his client was arrested and taken away immediately afterwards. At that point, the couple wanted to emigrate to neutral Eire, but Trott dissuaded them. Instead, early in 1939, they moved to Berlin, where Bielenberg, with extreme distaste, joined the Nazi party in order to take up a civil-service post. During a holiday in England that August, he visited his wife's highly-placed contacts - she was related to the Harmsworths, making her a niece of the press Lords Northcliffe and Rothermere. Like Trott, who undertook similar missions, Bielenberg looked, in vain, for prominent, non-political Britons to warn Hitler against invading Poland. They got back to Germany just in time for the outbreak of war in September. The dissidents, organised into a communist-style cell system, continued to meet in the Bielenbergs' huge apartment, where there were no neighbours to overhear their agonising about how to stop Hitler. They still placed their hope in German generals and foreign - particularly American - intervention in the war, rather than in the possibility of direct action of their own. Through contacts, Bielenberg wangled his way out of his ministry - and military - service into war-work in industry. When he was posted to eastern Germany, Christabel took their children to the Black Forest, and the couple saw little of each other until the last days of the war. The Gestapo closed in on the dissidents even before July 1944; afterwards, hundreds were arrested, and the ringleaders hanged by piano-wire after macabre show trials. Bielenberg, whom Trott had tried hard to reach just before the bomb plot, was held on suspicion of treason, just as he was preparing to raid the armoury at his Prussian factory for weapons with which to snatch his friend from prison. Christabel, accustomed to pulling strings and getting her own way, used her contacts to get Peter transferred from the east to Berlin. But after six weeks he was sent to Ravensbruck, a forced-labour camp for women, 50 miles north of Berlin, and was confined in the SS punishment block. A furious Christabel now decided to tackle the Gestapo officer responsible for Peter's interrogation, giving him such a dressing-down that he promised to get her husband out of the camp before he left for the eastern front. Bielenberg was released to a punishment company, but escaped to join his family in the Black Forest, where he hid until the fighting ended in May 1945. After the war, Christabel's indefatigable string-pulling ensured that her husband was the first German civilian to get a permit to go to Britain. Once he had recovered from a serious motor- cycle accident, they and their three sons emigrated to Ireland in 1948 and took up farming in County Carlow. Bielenberg approached this new challenge with a thoroughness worthy of the Prussian general staff, reading up on agriculture and finance while commissioning locally unheard-of soil tests. The resulting well-chosen fertilisers transformed a dilapidated and exhausted farm into a commercial success. As they settled amid Christabel's vast extended family, to which their own children and grandchildren added in due course, Peter seemed content to fade into the background, even when his wife's wartime memoir became a runaway bestseller. She survives him, as do their children. \u0095 Peter Bielenberg, lawyer, farmer and wartime dissident, born December 13 1911; died March 13 2001",

      "body": "<p>Between September and November 1940, the Nazis herded almost half a million Polish Jews into a 3.5-square-mile area that became known as the Warsaw Ghetto. One of them was Ruth Posner. Over the next four years, thousands were to perish within the ghetto walls, dying of typhus, starvation, and at the hands of bored German soldiers who would take pot shots at them for fun. Many more hundreds of thousands were deported to the gas chambers at Treblinka. A few, like Posner, escaped. </p> <p>She was the only child of a man who had been a local government official before the war. He knew his family's only hope of survival was to escape the ghetto - which, by mid-November 1940, was surrounded by a 10ft wall - and he still had the connections to do it. The Nazis hated the Jews but they also needed their forced labour, and in 1942 Posner's father arranged for his 12-year-old daughter and her aunt, whose two small children had already perished, to go to work at a Jewish-owned leather factory beyond the ghetto walls. Once a week, the factory workers were taken to a bathhouse close to the Aryan sector. One week Posner and her aunt made a run for it. \"We knew that if we were noticed, we would be shot. But if we stayed, we knew we would die anyway,\" she recalls. </p> <p>Posner spent the rest of the war pretending to be a young Polish Catholic girl called Irena Slabowska. It helped that, unlike so many Polish Jews, the family had not spoken Yiddish at home, so her Polish was pure and unaccented. It also helped that she was a natural actress. More than 30 years later, when Posner had had a career as a dancer and founder member of London Contemporary Dance, she told her aunt she intended to become an actress. Her aunt replied: \"Don't be silly - you did your best acting when you were 12. During the war you acted better than Sarah Bernhardt.\" </p> <p>Those less good at dissembling paid with their lives. Posner never found out what happened to her parents, although she believes they probably perished in Treblinka, unable to put into action their own escape plans, which she knows they had prepared, before one of the many mass deportations from the ghetto. She has never tried to find out for certain. \"Some people want to know exactly what happened to their families, but I don't because I feel part of them is still with me. I have enough imagination to know what happened to them, and I just hope it happened quickly.\" </p> <p>But she does know what happened to an eight-year-old cousin and another aunt who, like Posner, succeeded in escaping the ghetto and passed themselves off as Aryans. At eight it is hard to live a lie, and the little girl let slip her Jewish origins to their landlady, who denounced them to the Gestapo. Posner made no such slips. So ingrained was her new Polish Catholic identity that when, more than 40 years later, she was appearing in Theresa, a play about the Holocaust, she initially found it difficult to utter the line: \"I am a Jew.\" </p> <p>But Posner is a Jew and proud of it. Since appearing in Theresa she has starred in a number of other plays about the Holocaust, all written by the Jewish writer and director Julia Pascal. The latest, Woman in the Moon, which opened at the Arcola Theatre last week, considers the career of Wernher Von Braun, the Nazi scientist who engineered the building of the V1 and V2 rockets that devastated wartime London. Unlike many of his high-ranking Nazi colleagues, Von Braun was not tried at Nuremberg. Instead he was welcomed in the US, where he became the brains behind the 1969 moon landing. Yet during the war many slave workers died while working in the V2 factory. </p> <p>In Woman in the Moon, Posner plays Dora, a journalist interviewing Von Braun in the US after the war. Dora's own childhood escape from the concentration camps is no less incredible than Posner's. Reliving her experience every night must be traumatic. \"I think it is a kind of exorcism,\" replies Posner, who says that when she first came to Britain after the war she never discussed her past and, in fact, made strong efforts to leave it behind and wipe away all traces of her accent. She certainly has no desire to become known as \"that woman who always plays Holocaust survivors\" and says she sometimes longs for a role in a light comedy, \"although I know that with my accent nobody is going to cast me as Lady Bracknell. When Julia first talked to me about the play I thought, 'No, not another Holocaust play.' But then I remember there are people like David Irving around and that in 20 years there will be no witnesses left. We will all be dead. I think maybe that is why I became an actress - to tell these stories, not just to perform.\" </p> <p>Later, after escaping to the Polish countryside, she and her aunt returned to Warsaw. After the Warsaw uprising they were evacuated to a prisoner of war camp in Germany with other Poles. Even so, they were unable to let their disguises slip lest they be denounced as Jews. But, as the war drew to an end, the Germans wanted rid of these Polish prisoners. They were herded onto a train. Rumours spread that they were being sent to a concentration camp. As the train went through Essen it was caught in an American bombing raid. The German guards panicked and opened the train doors. Posner and her aunt slipped away. </p> <p>They were taken in by the owners of a farm, where they spent the rest of the war as labourers, still pretending to be Catholics. In the final days of the war two young German soldiers took refuge in the farm's attic. Allied forces came looking for German soldiers. \"They asked us if anyone was hiding there. I saw the German farmer's wife looking at us. I thought of everything we had been through, the pretending and the hiding. They were only boys - we couldn't betray them. My aunt and I said nothing.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Woman in the Moon is at the Arcola Theatre, London E8 (020-7503 1646), until April 7.</p>",

But women have been accused of participating in the crime of rape and at Blackfriars Crown Court in London on Friday, 18-year-old Claire Marsh was convicted of the rape of a 37-year-old woman. The teenager, who pinned the woman to the ground during a \"vile and horrifying\" sex attack, is thought to be the youngest of the few females ever to be convicted of such an offence in this country.</p> <p>Rape has been so strongly characterised as the definitive male crime against women that it is shocking to think another woman could side with the enemy in it. It is always assumed that women will identify with the female victim of rape and judge an accused man harshly. This is not necessarily so. Anecdotally, it has been observed that female jurors are more likely to listen sympathetically to the man and wonder whether the woman \"asked for it\" by wearing provocative clothes or \"leading him on\".</p> <p>The notion of \"sisterhood\" - that 1970s feminist theory of solidarity between all females - was based on the assumption that all women will identify with one another to the exclusion of all men. This idea came from America, where Marxism had never really got a foothold: for Marxism had taught that notions of solidarity were based on class, not sex. Simone de Beauvoir believed that feminism could never unite all women because of her understanding of Marxist thinking: the woman bourgeois does not have the same class interests as the female proletariat.</p> <p>But American-led feminism proclaimed that all women were sisters and that remains the philosophical basis of thinking about feminism to this day. Thus it is assumed that women in general will welcome the \"feminisation of the workplace\" and will identify with and support other women in a range of personal, and even political, circumstances. We are supposed to be horrified that the next parliament will very likely have fewer women MPs , though many females were probably secretly delighted when Germaine Greer trashed \"Blair's Babes\" as a useless yes-sir backing group for a narcissistic Tony Blair.</p> <p>Wanting more women in parliament is very 1970s, based on the notion that every woman in the country wants a female MP. They don't. They want an MP who best represents their interests, whether individual or community, and that could be either a man or a woman.</p> <p>I don't disparage, entirely, the notion of \"sisterhood\" advanced by 1970s feminism: like Christianity - and Marxism - there is a basic idealism and even a basic kindness to it. Women should be nice to one another and help one another along. Women shouldn't fall into the bitchy \"scratch-your-eyes-out\" stereotype that had been advanced in the past (and that is sometimes caricatured by male gays when camping up a quarrel).</p> <p>Women shouldn't be prejudiced against one another, as sometimes our mothers were, \"Loved him, hated her\" being a common judgment on encountering a couple. My mother had been friends with the German ambassador to Ireland in the 1940s and as a young feminist I remonstrated with her for this. \"How could you? He was a Nazi!\" Mother was indignant. \"He was a perfect gentleman! She might have been a Nazi\" - referring to the attractive wife in question - \"but he certainly wasn't.\"</p> <p>\"Oh, blame the woman!\" I yelled. We believed our generation would never take this hostile woman-against-woman approach: we would show solidarity with other females.</p> <p>All ideals eventually involve hypocrisy, because virtue is essentially against human nature. And looking back now, with as much honesty as I can bear to muster, this \"sisterly solidarity\" contained vast dollops of hypocrisy. Beneath the surface of feminist sisterly decorum, the usual spite and hatreds seethed. We thought nothing of stealing another woman's husband if it suited us, as the recent revelations in Esther Rantzen's autobiography have so disingenuously demonstrated. I now believe women positively like seducing other women's husbands, because the thrill of taking possession of the man is added to the usual frisson of a sexual adventure.</p> <p>Indeed, I think many young women actually prefer married men to single men because of the competitive excitement of trumping another woman - along with a Darwinian attraction to proven successful mates. In her book, Rantzen not only describes how she coveted Desmond Wilcox, her best friend's spouse: in what I now recognise as typical female fashion, she gloats over the fact that she was sexually so much more interesting than poor, boring old Patsy.</p> <p>Women can be supportive and sisterly to other women, but there has to be a value-added clause in the contract. Females are notoriously better at friendship than group bonding, and women make loyal individual friends. Women will encourage and help other women in work situations if they genuinely happen to like one another, or if there is a replication of a successful family relationship: mother-daughter, aunt-niece, the sibling bond of blood sisters. They will also cooperate if it is demonstrably in their interest. I am always nice to young women now because as I get older they will be the command generation and I will need them to be kind to me. Women, who control the world of social niceties, are also better at dissembling and will feign cordiality where they think they must. But where there is competition for men, deep, visceral dislike or a clash of values - the abortion debate has women on both sides - the solidarity of sisterhood is replaced by the fangs and claws of feline ferocity.</p> <p>Rape and personal violence are about the primitive side of human beings. I would hope no reasonable or decent woman would aid or abet a rape, but then we are not here in the realm of reason or decency. Among primates, a female will side with a powerful male against other females and against her own young. In cases of child abuse, the mother has at times sided with the abusive male rather than defend her child. Moreover, gang rape involves the particular psychology of manic group behaviour.</p> <p>There are a lot of complex elements in this picture. But we should not doubt that women can be beastly to other women at a number of levels. Sisterhood is not as powerful as we once imagined.</p>",

This defies rational interpretation. Does this imply that children should no longer get measles jabs, since we can't distinguish between immunity acquired due to disease or injection? Or that since measles has a moderate fatality rate, we should shoot all measles victims and produce a 100% fatality? Where is the science here?</p> <p>Other science tells us that foot and mouth causes a 40% reduction in production. For how long do these declines persist? How would we know? No animal since 1927 has survived in the UK after infection. We have no information on the response of modern UK breeds to this illness. Nor are there data from the US, since the last outbreak there was in 1929. Where does this information come from, and how relevant is it to the UK?</p> <p>Without eradication, our tourist industry would suffer. Really? I see little impact on tourism in Greece or Turkey, where the disease is still endemic. The impact on tourism with the current controls is, however, catastrophic.</p> <p>As a scientist concerned with issues of conservation and animal welfare, I find the government's response hard to interpret as science; rather it appears to be historical, political and economic. Let the debate focus more clearly on the origins of the policy of culling rather than on poorly presented scientific justifications. The \"science\" itself has not been subject to scrutiny or debate - it is simply the misapplication of science at the speed of a bullet. <br><b>PC Lee</b> <br>Reader in behavioural biology <br>University of Cambridge <br>pcl1@cus.cam.ac.uk</p> <p>\u0095 You rightly suggest we should be tough with this outbreak of foot and mouth but the other method of producing a firebreak to stop disease spreading, vaccination, appears not to have been considered by Maff. The sheep in the areas surrounding the Cumbrian, Welsh, Scottish and south-west outbreaks could all be vaccinated for the relevant strain of FMD. This method has been used in European outbreaks and was endorsed in a 1999 EU report by the scientific committee on animals health and welfare. This would mean a mass vaccination of sheep in the areas affected and the continuation of restrictions for 30 days after vaccination. Animals could then be blood-tested to see if they had suffered from foot and mouth before being safely moved for slaughter in the normal way. <br><b>Graham Hines</b> <br>Kemsing, Kent <br>grayvet@totalise.co.uk</p> <p>\u0095 Emma Nicholson's livestock e-mart proposal (An online lifeline, March 17) is not a new concept, having operated for a number of years from a mart in Inverurie, north-east Scotland. Although it goes some way to reducing disease transfer risks by addressing the issue of mass contamination at marts, it does not address the huge distances livestock will continue to travel. Only comprehensive plans to re-establish local links from farm gate to consumers' plates will reinvigorate our local food economies and reduce the impact of diseases such as foot and mouth. <br><b>Mark Ruskell</b> <br>Edinburgh</p>",

This defies rational interpretation. Does this imply that children should no longer get measles jabs, since we can't distinguish between immunity acquired due to disease or injection? Or that since measles has a moderate fatality rate, we should shoot all measles victims and produce a 100% fatality? Where is the science here? Other science tells us that foot and mouth causes a 40% reduction in production. For how long do these declines persist? How would we know? No animal since 1927 has survived in the UK after infection. We have no information on the response of modern UK breeds to this illness. Nor are there data from the US, since the last outbreak there was in 1929. Where does this information come from, and how relevant is it to the UK? Without eradication, our tourist industry would suffer. Really? I see little impact on tourism in Greece or Turkey, where the disease is still endemic. The impact on tourism with the current controls is, however, catastrophic. As a scientist concerned with issues of conservation and animal welfare, I find the government's response hard to interpret as science; rather it appears to be historical, political and economic. Let the debate focus more clearly on the origins of the policy of culling rather than on poorly presented scientific justifications. The \"science\" itself has not been subject to scrutiny or debate - it is simply the misapplication of science at the speed of a bullet. PC Lee Reader in behavioural biology University of Cambridge pcl1@cus.cam.ac.uk \u0095 You rightly suggest we should be tough with this outbreak of foot and mouth but the other method of producing a firebreak to stop disease spreading, vaccination, appears not to have been considered by Maff. The sheep in the areas surrounding the Cumbrian, Welsh, Scottish and south-west outbreaks could all be vaccinated for the relevant strain of FMD. This method has been used in European outbreaks and was endorsed in a 1999 EU report by the scientific committee on animals health and welfare. This would mean a mass vaccination of sheep in the areas affected and the continuation of restrictions for 30 days after vaccination. Animals could then be blood-tested to see if they had suffered from foot and mouth before being safely moved for slaughter in the normal way. Graham Hines Kemsing, Kent grayvet@totalise.co.uk \u0095 Emma Nicholson's livestock e-mart proposal (An online lifeline, March 17) is not a new concept, having operated for a number of years from a mart in Inverurie, north-east Scotland. Although it goes some way to reducing disease transfer risks by addressing the issue of mass contamination at marts, it does not address the huge distances livestock will continue to travel. Only comprehensive plans to re-establish local links from farm gate to consumers' plates will reinvigorate our local food economies and reduce the impact of diseases such as foot and mouth.

In her published report she says, \"he (Sir Peter) has gone out of his way to ensure that I was not in any doubt about the difficulties in his relationship with Mr Vaz over many years. This, in my view, is not the action of someone who is actuated by malice or revenge and I have seen no sign of such motivation in any of Sir Peter's dealings with me during this inquiry\" (para 351).</p> <p>In their report, the committee members said: \"We have considered carefully whether the antipathy between them may have coloured Sir Peter's evidence to the commissioner and to us, as Mr Vaz suggested to us.

      "bodyText": "From the transcripts of the committee on standards and privileges, I have discovered the extraordinary lengths to which Keith Vaz went, when speaking to the committee, to try to undermine my credibility as a witness. Significantly misrepresenting a number of the facts and ignoring the deep concerns we in Leicester have expressed about his past conduct, Keith tried to persuade the commissioner and the committee that, motivated by envy, I was personally orchestrating a vendetta against him (pages 18-20). I am pleased to read that the commissioner dealt with these allegations very directly. In her published report she says, \"he (Sir Peter) has gone out of his way to ensure that I was not in any doubt about the difficulties in his relationship with Mr Vaz over many years. This, in my view, is not the action of someone who is actuated by malice or revenge and I have seen no sign of such motivation in any of Sir Peter's dealings with me during this inquiry\" (para 351). In their report, the committee members said: \"We have considered carefully whether the antipathy between them may have coloured Sir Peter's evidence to the commissioner and to us, as Mr Vaz suggested to us. In our view it did not\" (para 38). It is, of course, regrettable that the committee members were not given sufficient cooperation to come to clear conclusions about the more substantial issues in front of them. But at least we in Leicester have the satisfaction of knowing that the rest of the country now understands Keith nearly as well as we do. Peter Soulsby Leicester peter.soulsby@leicester.gov.uk",

He and chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield have been under pressure to resign to appease larger shareholders. The company is weighed down by \u00a330bn of debt - equal to three quarters of its stock market valuation - because of its investment in third-generation mobile licences and in overseas acquisitions. BT wants to keep its credit rating; any downgrade would cost it an extra \u00a3200m a year in interest payments. Philip Hampton, the recently appointed finance director, has publicly stated that BT must reduce its debt by \u00a310bn by the end of this year. Mr Hampton is reported to be against spinning off BT Wireless after the recent poor performance of Orange shares. Under his plan, BT Wireless shares would be distributed to the company's shareholders. The group had hoped to pay back some of its loans by selling off its non-core assets and demerging others as separate listed firms but the collapse in technology and telecoms stocks means it would struggle to raise significant sums. Market conditions are also likely to scupper plans to float Yell, BT's Yellow Pages unit. The company's share price has tumbled from \u00a315 to just above \u00a35 in the past year.

      "body": "<p>Don't sign any contract until you've read the small print. This is especially true for international trade agreements that affect the lives of millions. Their core provisions are hidden behind a welter of acronyms and legal phrases. In the Guardian debate on February 26, Mike Moore, director general of the World Trade Organisation, said that concerns about Gats, or the general agreement on trade in services, were \"lies and distortions\". Let's look at the fine print. </p> <p>Gats aims for \"progressive liberalisation\". What does this mean? Governments agree to remove more and more regulations or restrictions on foreign service firms. Although there are temporary exceptions allowed, the whole thrust of Gats is to remove them. And it is a one-way process. WTO officials have described Gats as a means to lock in liberalisation and make it irreversible. </p> <p>At a time when governments are questioning the impact of gung-ho liberalisation, this is a dangerous provision. Gats would lock them into these policies, denying the opportunity for democratic debate on alternative policies. </p> <p>Even countries that have considerable experience in regulating service sectors are seeing the dangers of ill-conceived privatisation. Gats would mean that even public opinion or a change in government would not be able to reverse failed policies. It is a denial of democratic rights. </p> <p>Gats does not, as Mr Moore claims, allow countries to choose only the sectors they want to open up. Present negotiations aim to change the structure of Gats so that rules on one sector apply to related sectors. Gats also has provisions that apply to all service sectors. The rules on domestic regulation aim to remove \"unnecessary restrictions\" on trade and investment in services. Who decides what is unnecessary? The WTO. </p> <p>Mr Moore claims there is adequate protection under Gats for health and the environment. Yet WTO rules have already been used to overturn restrictions on trade to protect dolphins and turtles, block tobacco and hormone-injected beef imports and support Caribbean banana farmers. </p> <p>What are the criteria applied by the WTO? This is the subject of talks that recommence this month. Negotiators have rejected a broad definition of \"necessary to protect the public interest\". The criterion already included is that any measure must be \"no more burdensome than necessary\" on foreign service providers. That could be used to challenge national and local government rules. </p> <p>At its core, Gats gives foreign firms rights that are elevated above other aims. As the European commission has said: \"Gats is not just something that exists between governments. It is first and foremost an instrument for the benefit of business.\" </p> <p>Mr Moore is right to say Gats excludes services supplied by governments. But Gats does include those services supplied commercially or in competition with the private sector. This describes an increasingly large proportion of \"public\" service sectors. </p> <p>More broadly, he suggests that WTO members are eager to negotiate on Gats. But few poor countries have the capacity to get a good deal. And they are likely to make commitments under Gats that are not in their long-term interest as a price for reform of the EU's common agricultural policy.

      "bodyText": "Don't sign any contract until you've read the small print. This is especially true for international trade agreements that affect the lives of millions. Their core provisions are hidden behind a welter of acronyms and legal phrases. In the Guardian debate on February 26, Mike Moore, director general of the World Trade Organisation, said that concerns about Gats, or the general agreement on trade in services, were \"lies and distortions\". Let's look at the fine print. Gats aims for \"progressive liberalisation\". What does this mean? Governments agree to remove more and more regulations or restrictions on foreign service firms. Although there are temporary exceptions allowed, the whole thrust of Gats is to remove them. And it is a one-way process. WTO officials have described Gats as a means to lock in liberalisation and make it irreversible. At a time when governments are questioning the impact of gung-ho liberalisation, this is a dangerous provision. Gats would lock them into these policies, denying the opportunity for democratic debate on alternative policies. Even countries that have considerable experience in regulating service sectors are seeing the dangers of ill-conceived privatisation. Gats would mean that even public opinion or a change in government would not be able to reverse failed policies. It is a denial of democratic rights. Gats does not, as Mr Moore claims, allow countries to choose only the sectors they want to open up. Present negotiations aim to change the structure of Gats so that rules on one sector apply to related sectors. Gats also has provisions that apply to all service sectors. The rules on domestic regulation aim to remove \"unnecessary restrictions\" on trade and investment in services. Who decides what is unnecessary? The WTO. Mr Moore claims there is adequate protection under Gats for health and the environment. Yet WTO rules have already been used to overturn restrictions on trade to protect dolphins and turtles, block tobacco and hormone-injected beef imports and support Caribbean banana farmers. What are the criteria applied by the WTO? This is the subject of talks that recommence this month. Negotiators have rejected a broad definition of \"necessary to protect the public interest\". The criterion already included is that any measure must be \"no more burdensome than necessary\" on foreign service providers. That could be used to challenge national and local government rules. At its core, Gats gives foreign firms rights that are elevated above other aims. As the European commission has said: \"Gats is not just something that exists between governments. It is first and foremost an instrument for the benefit of business.\" Mr Moore is right to say Gats excludes services supplied by governments. But Gats does include those services supplied commercially or in competition with the private sector. This describes an increasingly large proportion of \"public\" service sectors. More broadly, he suggests that WTO members are eager to negotiate on Gats. But few poor countries have the capacity to get a good deal. And they are likely to make commitments under Gats that are not in their long-term interest as a price for reform of the EU's common agricultural policy. The priority for the WTO must be to fix existing unfair agreements and negotiating processes. Mr Moore's claims of the vast benefits of liberalisation are a based on trickle-down economics. More evidence would be helpful. Developing nations have been calling for a full assessment of the experience from services liberalisation in the past. It hasn't been done. Unfair rules that prioritise the interests of firms are a recipe for exploitation. A strong campaign on Gats is building around the world. A motion on it in the Scottish parliament is supported by most MSPs, and 150 Westminster MPs have signed a motion. Last week, the international development committee called for an independent commission on Gats.

Two days ago Macedonian police took up positions in the area, between the villages of Licets and Sipkovica, but yesterday it slipped out of their control. The police have now withdrawn a mile and half down the road, well within the city area. \"Not only will we try and protect our positions but we are going to expand them, and take more territory,\" the NLA commander said. But he admitted that his forces had suffered casualties in the main area of fighting, near the village of Larce. \"We have had many soldiers slightly wounded. One soldier has been killed by a sniper. He was shot in the leg. He was a little bit far away and nobody could help him. He bled to death.\" The rebels have urged Albanian citizens of Macedonia to take up arms and join their struggle, but many remain suspicious of the NLA and its motives. \"I don't know what to say about them. I do not know even if we can trust them or not,\" said Shefik Azizi, 25, after guiding a group of fellow ethnic Albanians fleeing the threat of violence into neighbouring Albania. In some areas of Tetovo yesterday no more than 50 metres separated the government troops, huddled in fortified positions on the outskirts, and rebel units hidden on the scrub-covered slopes. Near the old bazaar district residents hid behind walls and cowered in doorways during sporadic gun battles. A little girl cradled a pink stuffed rabbit, covering its ears during the gunfire. The security forces were unable to leave their fortified bunkers. Rebels control the few roads into the steep mountains around the Popova Shapka ski centre, near the Kosovan border, and were on the watch behind roadblocks of branches. A bit further into the city, in the Slav neighbourhood of Koltuk, about 30 people gathered for a Christian Orthodox service at Saint Nicholas church. They held bunches of dried sage during the chanting of the lenten liturgy, drowned out by the sounds of battle half a mile away. \"Pray for the Christians of Macedonia and especially here in Tetovo,\" the priest intoned. The sharp smell of the burning woodland carried by on a north wind drifted into the church and mixed with the odour of incense. \"I don't often go to church,\" said Dimitri Kolovski, who winced at each blast from the Macedonian gunners. \"But how can you not pray at a time like this?\" Outside, people packed their cars with essential belongings and headed away from the main Slav enclave in Tetovo. Hundreds were reported to have fled from Tetovo and Skopje, the capital, among them about 350 ethnic Macedonians who escaped to southern area of Serbia.",

      "bodyText": "A page in the history of Paris looked set to turn last night as exit polls put the left ahead in an agonisingly tight race for the French capital, under conservative control for 130 years. Projections by the pollsters Sofres and Ipsos gave a socialist-led coalition between 79 and 90 seats on the 163-seat Paris city council, against 73 to 84 for the right, while a rival organisation, CSA, predicted the left-wing alliance would capture 88 seats. On a night when many of France's provincial towns swung to the right, the vote in the country's second-biggest city, Lyon, looked even closer than in Paris, with the Socialists again forecast to emerge victorious by just two or three seats. Although the results were unlikely to be confirmed until this morning, several thousand champagne-swilling Socialist supporters began gathering outside Paris city hall by late evening to celebrate. The French capital has not been run by a leftwing council since the uprising of the 1871 Paris Commune, and throughout the 1980s was so dominated by President Jacques Chirac's Gaullist RPR party that all 20 of its arrondissements were under conservative control. Ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections in 2002, its capture by the left would deal a blow to the French president, who is struggling to defend himself against an array of corruption scandals dating from his 18 years as the city's mayor. If his victory is confirmed, the unassuming Socialist candidate for mayor, Bertrand Delanoe, will become the first publicly-declared homosexual politician to hold a post of national importance in France. Last Sunday's first round of voting to elect some 36,000 mayors around France saw all eyes focused on the conservative Paris, Lyon and Toulouse. In the capital, a feud between the rightist candidate, Philippe S\u00e9guin, and the outgoing mayor, Jean Tiberi, threatened to hand victory to the Socialists. In Toulouse, the Socialists and Greens appeared to have narrowly lost in their bid to upset the rightist candidate, Philippe Douste-Blazy. The run-off was not exclusively good news for the Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin: The high-profile Socialist labour minister Elisabeth Guigou in Avignon, the European affairs minister Pierre Moscovici in Montbeliard and the education minister Jack Lang in Blois all seemed headed for defeat. The vote also looked bleak for the Communists. Sofres projected that one party incumbent, Alain Clary, would fall to the RPR in Nimes .",

At the moment they are saying a large part of her brain is dead, but we don't know what the outcome will be.\" He said no one could understand how the overdose could have been given to a patient on an intensive care ward. \"The whole system was a failure.\" A spokeswoman for the hospital said: \"We have offered a full and unreserved apology to Teresita and her family for what has happened. We have got an investigation ongoing and the results of that will be out some time next week. \"Teresita was on insulin, and it looks as if she received more than she should have done. We don't know at the moment whether that was due to human error or machine error. \"We are talking to the family about the best way forward for her.\"",

The order turns out to have been an illusion; with the arrival of foot and mouth, a hellish scene of fire and slaughter has erupted instead, more Hieronymus Bosch than 18th-century landscape portrait. They have cancelled their holidays in droves.</p> <p>Americans have decided it is safer to spend the \u00a320m a week they usually bring to the UK elsewhere. British day trippers who bring \u00a39m a year to country businesses have melted away too. The English Tourist Council estimates that the tourist trade is losing \u00a3250m a week.</p> <p>Farmers meanwhile are losing perhaps \u00a360m a week, and people are beginning to question whether the smoke from the funeral pyres has blinded us to the economic realities. With draconian restrictions on movement, and policies which have effectively closed down the countryside, has the government been concentrating its efforts on the wrong people?</p> <p>Tourism generates about 4% of GDP, while agriculture (arable included) makes about 1.5% of GDP. Take out poultry, which is not affected by the disease, and the total value of livestock from British farms was about \u00a34bn in 1999.</p> <p>Takings from tourism in March are usually worth more than \u00a3700m, rising to about \u00a31.2bn in April, but advanced bookings are down by about a third. In Cumbria alone, pubs, shops, hotels, restaurants and other businesses that cater to the tourist trade are losing \u00a38m and 350 jobs a week.</p> <p>In fact if you start to look at jobs, the response to the crisis can look even more distorted. Agriculture accounts for just 2% of employment in rural districts. As the chart shows most people in the country work not on the land but in leisure and distribution (21%), public services (28%), banking and finance (11%) or manufacturing (17%).</p> <p>Yet the government has focused on minimising the impact on agriculture. It has negotiated with Brussels to bring forward \u00a3154m of European Union agricultural support payments, 80% of which will be paid by UK taxpayers. And farmers will have the lifeline of compensation. By the middle of last week 69 claims worth \u00a36.7m had been authorised by the Ministry of Agriculture (Maff). The potential claims from those who have either suffered confirmed outbreaks of foot and mouth or whose herds have been in dangerous contact with the disease were standing at about 365 at the end of last week. Compensation for these could be \u00a336m or more. Now that the government has decided to cull all animals within a 3km radius of infected flocks, these payments could quadruple.</p> <p>So far the talk of support to other rural businesses devastated by the epidemic extends as far as a holiday from rates, which might cost \u00a325m.</p> <p>But somehow all these figures miss the point. The paradox of British farming is that although it earns a tiny fraction of national income, it occupies 75% of the national space. Urbanites who argue that farmers these days are little more than custodians (and none too environmentally friendly ones at that) of theme park Britain fail to understand the extent to which our sense of identity is invested in the pastoral landscape.</p> <p>The grazing of animals has acquired symbolic meaning. The English landscape is a tamed and cultivated one, shaped over centuries by men and animals, medieval drove roads, by generations of ploughing and hill farming and the enclosures. It is all that which attracts the tourists. Despite being one of the most industrialised and urbanised countries in the world, we cling to agricultural rituals because they give us our sense of place and season.</p> <p>The gap between bucolic idyll and reality has always existed. Gainsborough's Mr and Mrs Andrews may have sat in prosperous harmony atop their Capability Brown style parkland, but even in the 18th century writers knew the truth to be that the country was a harsh and dirty place. (Tobias Smollett's Humphry Clinker hated his journeys through the countryside; in real life the coaches of the rich had window blinds decorated with elegant urban scenes to shield their occupants from sight of the mire.)</p> <p>Modern rural reality may be hell, with warehouses selling discount electrical goods on ring roads and farms with cattle sheds the size of factories. But we maintain the illusion and fight to preserve it because our social history has been bound up with it since earliest times. That is why an agricultural crisis, with farmers traumatised by the loss of their flocks, has so much more power to move than the closure of black coal pits or ugly car factories.</p> <p>The sentiment is not just stubborn habit. Tourism, leisure and farming are inextricably linked. As the Country Land and Business Association put it so graphically, \"people don't go for a picnic looking over a field of sugar beet\". They like to see meadows where sheep may safely graze. That is one reason why those representing the tourist industry have been so reluctant to criticise Maff's priorities.</p> <p>With the new policy of mass slaughter, up to 500,000 animals may have to be killed. That would still be only a fraction of the 35m or so pigs, sheep and cattle sent to the abattoirs in the UK each year for food, but the prospect of shooting swaths of the national herd touches many more than the farmers who mourn them directly.</p> <p>\u0095 Felicity Lawrence is the Guardian's consumer affairs correspondent.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:felicity.lawrence@theguardian.com\">felicity.lawrence@theguardian.com </a></p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,443686,00.html\">Full list: outbreaks and precautionary measures</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a></p> <p><b>The front line</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br>What is the situation on the ground?

Yet there they were, the first snakes of spring, newly emerged from hibernation. </p> <p>Where the metal sheet had lain all winter the vegetation was a sickly rectangle of insipid yellow. Against such a lifeless colour the brown and blackish zigzag patterns of the adders appeared all the more startling. Arranged in perfect coils, the snakes looked like some weird perennial bloom that had just pushed up in the hothouse conditions beneath their metal cloche. Although they seem to have nothing whatsoever in common with the virginal innocence of snowdrops, the snakes share with the flowers a symbolic status as our earliest sign of spring. </p> <p>The adder is one of the world's most cold-tolerant snakes. It has been recorded at altitudes of up to 3000m in the Swiss Alps and occurs in the Russian and Scandinavian taiga beyond the Arctic Circle to 68 N, which must be the northerly limit for any reptile. </p> <p>It can emerge from the hibernaculum as soon as the average midday temperature rises to 8 C, and in southern Europe the period of dormancy can be as little as three months. At the extreme northern edge of its range, however, there may be as many as 275 days of inactivity. It means that this relatively long-lived creature can spend three-quarters of its life sleeping. </p> <p>One cannot help wondering, as these creatures lie coiled together in their mysterious subterranean chamber, what dreams disturb those long months of slumber once March comes round again? </p>",

      "bodyText": "Thorpe Hamlet, Norfolk It was extraordinary to reflect, as I lifted the lid on my favourite jumble of old scrap metal, that the snowman in our garden had only melted five days earlier. Yet there they were, the first snakes of spring, newly emerged from hibernation. Where the metal sheet had lain all winter the vegetation was a sickly rectangle of insipid yellow. Against such a lifeless colour the brown and blackish zigzag patterns of the adders appeared all the more startling. Arranged in perfect coils, the snakes looked like some weird perennial bloom that had just pushed up in the hothouse conditions beneath their metal cloche. Although they seem to have nothing whatsoever in common with the virginal innocence of snowdrops, the snakes share with the flowers a symbolic status as our earliest sign of spring. The adder is one of the world's most cold-tolerant snakes. It has been recorded at altitudes of up to 3000m in the Swiss Alps and occurs in the Russian and Scandinavian taiga beyond the Arctic Circle to 68 N, which must be the northerly limit for any reptile. It can emerge from the hibernaculum as soon as the average midday temperature rises to 8 C, and in southern Europe the period of dormancy can be as little as three months. At the extreme northern edge of its range, however, there may be as many as 275 days of inactivity. It means that this relatively long-lived creature can spend three-quarters of its life sleeping. One cannot help wondering, as these creatures lie coiled together in their mysterious subterranean chamber, what dreams disturb those long months of slumber once March comes round again?",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In <strong> The Hit Factory: The Pete Waterman Story</strong> (C5, Sunday), pop producer Pete Waterman was keen to persuade us how difficult it is to keep pumping out pop songs. People think it's easy but it's not, he steamed. A pop song is no good if you don't believe in it, because you won't convince the public. As he grows longer in the tooth and sits back to take stock (or indeed Aitken) of his glittering career, Waterman has obviously adopted this as his mantra, since he had already given us a variation on it in BBC2's new history-of-pop series <strong> Walk On By</strong> on Saturday night. That time, he insisted that writing pop songs is \"the hardest thing in the world\". </p> <p>Myself, I suspect that writing pop songs probably isn't harder than finding a cure for Alzheimer's disease or making the trains run on time, but one of the great things about being in pop is that you know if you can survive 15 years after your first (or only) hit, you're guaranteed uncritical retrospective deification. Which isn't to say that Stock, Aitken &amp; Waterman didn't have an extraordinary knack for pumping out high-energy pop-disco potboilers, nor that there isn't a distinct skill in concocting a song to suit a particular performer, especially if it's Rick Astley. There was also a lip-smacking irony in the fact that Waterman's records regularly topped the independent charts, driving followers of Morrissey or the Sisters Of Mercy to self-righteous apoplexy. But to start claiming that SAW's battery-farmed knock-offs were \"great pop music\" which \"defined a decade\" is rather like hailing the modesty and wisdom of Lord Irvine, or putting Vanessa Feltz's head on the stamps. </p> <p>Walk On By took a look at pop history through the opposite end of the telescope. While we are now assured that there is no qualitative difference between Mozart and Eminem, as long as you're tone deaf and have never owned a CD player, that's still no excuse for the deployment of politically correct anthropology as an infallible guide to the history of pop. </p> <p>Some of this opening programme was quite \"interesting\" - a lethal adjective, but show me a better one - particularly some rare home movies of such titans of tunesmithery as George Gershwin and Irving Berlin. But its determination to trawl through the history of emigration from Russia in the 19th century to explain how Popular Music was eventually born in New York made for vexatious viewing. There was lots of professorial stuff about ethnic rivalries in the Big Apple and the way black performers had to caricature themselves to get ahead in vaudeville, but you never got much sense of the dynamism and irresponsibility of popular music. Pop makes you kick your shoes off and start leaping around the room, and one of the things that has always made it popular is that you don't have to study academic tracts from people like the critic Stanley Crouch or \"writer and musician\" Ian Whitcomb in order to enjoy it. Maybe forthcoming episodes will feature more pop and fewer po-faces. </p> <p>Connoisseurs of fine art probably don't regard television as their primary source of information on the subject - they've learned the hard way that all TV viewers want to know is \"why we're all obsessed with Big Brother!\" - so it seems reasonable to hail <strong> Omnibus</strong> 's effort to put Botticelli on the small screen (BBC2, Saturday). The film traced the way Botticelli's drawings enhanced Dante's Divine Comedy, and a gallery of critics, clerics and academics had been teed up to eulogise the great Florentine's mastery of line, his wicked gift for caricature, and his profound understanding of the horror and anguish in Dante's depictions of Hell and Purgatory. </p> <p>My preview tape didn't have any captions on it, so I was left to puzzle over the identities of the various talking heads. Who was the rather louche gentleman sitting in a book-lined study? Who was the nervous lady reluctant to discuss Botticelli's fondness for obscene innuendo? It seemed like a flashback to a more innocent age of broadcasting. However, in reality it was a plug for the Botticelli exhibition at the Royal Academy.</p>",

Connoisseurs of fine art probably don't regard television as their primary source of information on the subject - they've learned the hard way that all TV viewers want to know is \"why we're all obsessed with Big Brother!\" - so it seems reasonable to hail Omnibus 's effort to put Botticelli on the small screen (BBC2, Saturday). The film traced the way Botticelli's drawings enhanced Dante's Divine Comedy, and a gallery of critics, clerics and academics had been teed up to eulogise the great Florentine's mastery of line, his wicked gift for caricature, and his profound understanding of the horror and anguish in Dante's depictions of Hell and Purgatory. My preview tape didn't have any captions on it, so I was left to puzzle over the identities of the various talking heads. Who was the rather louche gentleman sitting in a book-lined study? Who was the nervous lady reluctant to discuss Botticelli's fondness for obscene innuendo? It seemed like a flashback to a more innocent age of broadcasting. However, in reality it was a plug for the Botticelli exhibition at the Royal Academy.",

      "bodyText": "The western Sydney suburb of Cabramatta is a bustling community whose shops sell cheap clothes, mobile phones and Vietnamese snacks. But the district's main trade is in heroin and visiting addicts bring gang warfare, teenage prostitution and disease. Now residents of the most multicultural district in Australia are fighting back - against the police and the government. Last week a group of Cabramatta businesspeople launched an extraordinary legal action against the New South Wales government for failing to combat the drug trade. An parliamentary inquiry has exposed a catalogue of policy blunders in Cabramatta, including the launch of a $A176m (\u00a360m) drug prevention initiative that failed to make an impact partly because its newsletters were printed only in English, which is not the first language for 70% of the suburb's residents. While police chiefs insist that their campaign to boost beat policing has been a success, there have been more than 500 overdoses in Cabramatta in the last two years and the number of arrests for drug dealing has fallen by 52%. The government plans to increase police numbers by 100 in the area and Bob Carr, the New South Wales premier, has called for fresh policing ideas. According to Thang Ngo, the only Vietnamese-speaking local councillor, the police must build better relations with his community if they are to combat the drugs problem. None of the 140 officers in Cabramatta speak Vietnamese or Chinese. \"You can't police a community you don't understand and Cabramatta is like no other community in Australia,\" said Mr Ngo. \"More than 130 different languages are spoken in the area. Until there is some understanding between police and the community we won't make progress.\" Police said yesterday that some officers would be enrolled in crash courses in Vietnamese and Cambodian, but there has so far been no drive to recruit officers from ethnic minorities. As confidence in the police has fallen, so drug-related crime has risen. Residents of one street claim the street was burgled 85 times in six months, but just nine incidents were reported to the authorities. Two constables patrolling the streets on mountain bikes shrug their shoulders when asked about the drug problem.

Mr Sharon is to meet President Bush tomorrow.</p> <p>The Israeli press said he was travelling with two aims: to explore common ground with Washington in its desire to contain Saddam Hussein, and to assure Mr Bush that Israel will not try to drag Washington into an active mediating role with the Palestinians.</p> <p>Mr Sharon's advisers are preaching \"containment\": using Israel's siege of Palestinian cities to force an end to the intifada.</p> <p>Yesterday Palestinian officials accused Israeli soldiers of tightening the siege by installing an electric gate on a road north from Jericho to Nablus, sealing both towns off from their agricultural hinterland.</p> <p>The area has been the most peaceful part of the West Bank during the uprising.</p> <p>The government has stepped up its rhetoric against Mr Arafat's administration, directly accusing his elite Force 17 bodyguard of attacking Israeli soldiers and civilians.</p> <p>Mr Sharon hopes this will persuade Mr Bush that the Palestinian Authority is a terrorist body. Nevertheless, he confirmed yesterday that he had ordered renewed talks between his security chiefs and their Palestinain counterparts.</p> <p>He is also expected to stress Israel's concern about Russian and Iranian nuclear cooperation and the prospect of Syria winning a seat on the UN security council.</p> <p>The government is nervous about protests in Washington drawing attention to Mr Sharon's past and his indirect responsibility for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees by Christian militias in Beirut in 1982.</p> <p>\"This may be a small step for President Bush, who is currently gathering a string of the world's leaders at his court, but it is a very big step for Sharon,\" the commentator Hemi Shalev wrote in Yediot Ahronoth, Israel's biggest-selling daily, yesterday.</p> <p>\"The person who was once pushed to the margins of politics is finding himself alive and kicking in the centre of things, and he does not care if everyone else turns green with envy.</p> <p>\"Mr Sharon may have been sworn in as prime minister but in many respects he will only be inaugurated this week, in the Oval Room, in front of the world and its leaders.\"</p> <p>The transformation is especially sweet since it was President George Bush Sr who forbade senior US officials to meet him when he visited Washington as housing minister 10 years ago.</p> <p>Other commentators said Mr Sharon could lose support if the West Bank siege stands in the way of Washington's efforts to create an Arab coalition against Saddam Hussein.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ariel Sharon left Israel yesterday on the ritual pilgrimage to Washington, hoping it will put the stamp of credibility on his new government and rub out the taint of his notorious past. He hopes to use the traditional US distrust of Yasser Arafat to persuade President George Bush that the Palestinian authority has lost its legitimacy. Leaving Tel Aviv airport, he spoke of the \"common interests\" of Israel and the US, \"including the drive towards regional stability and preventing terrorism and violence\". Israeli officials were confident the visit would go smoothly. \"I would say Israel has a good starting point ... because we are meeting with a government that ... agrees with many of our assessments,\" Zalman Shoval, a former ambassador to the US and an adviser to Mr Sharon, told Israel Radio. Mr Sharon is to meet President Bush tomorrow. The Israeli press said he was travelling with two aims: to explore common ground with Washington in its desire to contain Saddam Hussein, and to assure Mr Bush that Israel will not try to drag Washington into an active mediating role with the Palestinians. Mr Sharon's advisers are preaching \"containment\": using Israel's siege of Palestinian cities to force an end to the intifada. Yesterday Palestinian officials accused Israeli soldiers of tightening the siege by installing an electric gate on a road north from Jericho to Nablus, sealing both towns off from their agricultural hinterland. The area has been the most peaceful part of the West Bank during the uprising. The government has stepped up its rhetoric against Mr Arafat's administration, directly accusing his elite Force 17 bodyguard of attacking Israeli soldiers and civilians. Mr Sharon hopes this will persuade Mr Bush that the Palestinian Authority is a terrorist body. Nevertheless, he confirmed yesterday that he had ordered renewed talks between his security chiefs and their Palestinain counterparts. He is also expected to stress Israel's concern about Russian and Iranian nuclear cooperation and the prospect of Syria winning a seat on the UN security council. The government is nervous about protests in Washington drawing attention to Mr Sharon's past and his indirect responsibility for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees by Christian militias in Beirut in 1982. \"This may be a small step for President Bush, who is currently gathering a string of the world's leaders at his court, but it is a very big step for Sharon,\" the commentator Hemi Shalev wrote in Yediot Ahronoth, Israel's biggest-selling daily, yesterday. \"The person who was once pushed to the margins of politics is finding himself alive and kicking in the centre of things, and he does not care if everyone else turns green with envy. \"Mr Sharon may have been sworn in as prime minister but in many respects he will only be inaugurated this week, in the Oval Room, in front of the world and its leaders.\" The transformation is especially sweet since it was President George Bush Sr who forbade senior US officials to meet him when he visited Washington as housing minister 10 years ago. Other commentators said Mr Sharon could lose support if the West Bank siege stands in the way of Washington's efforts to create an Arab coalition against Saddam Hussein.",

      "bodyText": "In more than 200 outbreaks of foot and mouth disease, one case stands out: Burnside farm, Heddon-on-the-Wall, and its probable cause, pigswill. Behind this case lies a complex investigation of how the virus managed to jump several thousand miles to an obscure piggery in Northumberland. A virus, imported in meat from an unknown country, found its way into pigswill and began to cut a swath through British farming which has so far led to the deaths of nearly 200,000 animals. Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, and the chief veterinary officer, Jim Scudamore, have repeatedly said this virus could not arrive in Britain legally, let alone get into pigswill. Somewhere along the line, and probably more than once, there must have been illegal action. The fear of spreading the disease further immediately led to the banning of British live exports and animals products. It was the ban on live animals and meat from countries with foot and mouth that had protected the UK from the disease for 20 years, but somewhere the system failed. To protect Europe, all airline foods and foods from ships are destroyed, and there are detailed regulations on what can be fed to farm animals. Only pigs are allowed to eat meat in the form of treated swill. With hindsight, despite the long gap between outbreaks and, at least on paper, the tight regulations, the return of foot and mouth was predictable. Two connected factors have made its arrival more likely. One is the spread of the disease across the world, and the second is the liberalisation of trade, which means cheap frozen meat is traded across continents. The type O virus now rampant in Britain was originally found in India in 1990 and spread west to Saudi Arabia and the Middle East, reaching Greece before being snuffed out in 1998. It also moved eastward, reaching China, Tibet, Russia, Taiwan, Burma, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, Laos, South Korea and Japan by 2000. Last year it moved to South Africa. South America already has foot and mouth but not the same strain. Under international rules, an immediate ban is placed on movements of meat and dairy products to the EU from infected countries. All meat must in any event be certified foot and mouth free before it can be imported. But there is no inspection system in Britain for the disease. Certificates and forms showing country of origin rely on the honesty of the shipper; inspection has not been seen as a priority because there is no danger to human health from infected meat. So assuming meat from one of these countries with outbreaks, and carcasses from Botswana in southern Africa, can be bought at Smithfield market in London, how did infected meat find its way into pigswill in Northumberland? Bobby Waugh, the farmer concerned in the Heddon-on-the-Wall outbreak, said food from schools in Sunderland and Gateshead went into his pigswill - containing scraps of meat from an unknown source. So if cash-strapped local authorities had been buying cheap foreign meat for their pupils, which turned out to have come from a country with a foot and mouth problem, this could have caused the infection. But the rules on cooking up pigswill are strict and designed to prevent this. The swill has to be at 100C (212F) for an hour to kill all viruses including foot and mouth. This should have saved Mr Waugh's pig herd, even if he was unfortunate enough to have had infected meat in his swill. The Ministry of Agriculture is still solving the puzzle of what caused Mr Waugh's outbreak. Fear of prejudicing any prosecution has brought an end to official comment on the precise route of the infection, but Mr Brown has ordered a review of the whole issue of feeding swill to pigs.

A spokesman for the Scottish executive would not identify the farms but said more than 1,800 animals had been slaughtered.</p> <p>Culls are expected at four farms in the Highlands early this week, and may also start in the south-west, so far the only area of Scotland to be hit by the outbreak. Two further cases have brought the Scottish total to 42, all in Dumfries and Galloway.</p> <p>The stated aim is to destroy 200,000 healthy sheep in Scotland in a pre-emptive strike to try to halt the outbreak. Animals within 3km of infected farms will be culled, along with thousands of healthy sheep at 30 farms outside the 3km radius but which had links to the Longtown market. Of the 30 farms involved, 17 are in Dumfries and Galloway, one in Ayrshire, one in Aberdeenshire, six in the Highlands, four in the Borders and one in Renfrewshire.</p> <p>The cull in Dumfries and Galloway is planned to accompany one in adjacent Cumbria. But some farmers in Cumbria are promising \"all-out war\" over the mass cull, and therefore it will not begin in Cumbria and in Dumfries and Galloway until after Jim Scudamore, the chief veterinary officer, meets farmers' leaders today. Yesterday, however, farmers in Scotland described the measure as heartbreaking but a necessary evil.</p> <p>\"They realise and understand the need, and know it must be done as quickly as possible,\" said John Kinnaird, vice president of the National Farmers Union in Scotland. \"It is a very virulent disease and can be masked in sheep, that's why they need to be taken out in the cull. We have to rely on veterinary and scientific advice, and that's their best advice. At the moment they see it as the only means of trying to contain the disease and ultimately eradicate it.\"</p> <p>Mr Kinnaird did warn that many farmers were facing total loss. \"Many people will not restart. You are looking at a lifetime's work being destroyed. People talk about compensation, but money will not replace a lifetime's work.\"</p> <p>Vets have confirmed more than 120 cases in the area of Cumbria and Dumfries and Galloway, and agriculture department officials believe culls are the only way they can eradicate the disease. But some farmers are angry at the proposals to slaughter all sheep and pigs, and cattle that vets believe could be infected, within 3kms of an outbreak.</p> <p>In England, a lobby group, Farmers For Action, has warned that it will launch \"all-out war\" to stop healthy animals being destroyed and is seeking a judicial review of the government's handling of the crisis.</p> <p>\"Any war being fought should be against the disease, not against the authorities trying to contain it,\" countered Nick Brown, the minister for agriculture, at a departmental briefing in London yesterday.</p> <p>\"The whole country has got to be on the same side. It is not helpful to try to obstruct the government's disease control measures. They will work best if people cooperate.</p> <p>\"I know it is incredibly hard and how worried farmers must be, which is why I have asked Jim [Scudamore] to go up to explain to fair-minded farmers, who I think will understand it is necessary.\"</p> <p>Joyce Quin, the deputy agriculture minister, visited Cumbria for talks yesterday and Mr Brown hopes to meet farmers there by the end of the week.</p> <p>Ms Quin said farmers she had spoken to were very concerned about government policy, but that there was \"huge support\" for the overall strategy.</p> <p>Mr Brown also warned that Devon, which had seen 43 cases by last night, might face a similar cull. \"We are trying very hard not to do this in Devon, but I cannot promise that we won't,\" he said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, some parts of the Scottish countryside have reopened to the public.

An alliance dominated by the Socialist party and the Greens headed by the unassuming Bertrand Delano\u00eb - until last year an unknown senator and local councillor - was proclaimed the winner of a majority of seats after an agonisingly tight race. The official result, due to be confirmed by the interior ministry this morning, is expected to give the coalition 88 seats on the 163-seat council. A committee of councillors formally elects the mayor on Friday. The Paris result came in the second round of local elections across France, but the news in many other centres was far from bright for the governing Socialists. In the capital, however, a delirious crowd of tens of thousands of champagne-drinking supporters converged on the town hall - for nearly a quarter of a century the fiefdom of Jacques Chirac, now France's conservative president. Mr Delano\u00eb promised to be a mayor for all Parisians. He called the election outcome a \"victory for audacity and reason\". In the square at the town hall, the Hotel de Ville, members of the Delano\u00eb coalition - which also includes Communists and leftwing radicals - were swinging from lamp-posts and waving their house keys as they jokingly demanded entry: \"Give us the keys! Give us the keys!\" The French capital has not been run by a leftwing administration since the bloody popular uprising of the 1871 Paris Commune, and throughout the 1980s was so dominated by Mr Chirac's Gaullist RPR party that all 20 of its arrondissements were under conservative control. Ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections in 2002, the capture of Paris by the left is bound to deal a blow to the president, who is struggling to defend himself against an array of corruption scandals dating from his 18 years as the city's mayor. An incoming Socialist administration is likely to cooperate fully with magistrates investigating the scandals - inquiries which until now have dragged along. Last night Mr Delano\u00eb told cheering supporters it was \"time for a democratic party from which no Parisians should feel excluded\". The people of the city had made a choice for \"profound change\" in electing him as mayor. Their decision would bring \"a change of culture and of democratic practices\". Mr Delano\u00eb will also become the first publicly declared homosexual politician to hold a post of national importance in France. On a night when many of France's provincial towns swung to the right, the vote in the country's second-biggest city, Lyon, looked even closer than in Paris, with the Socialists forecast to emerge victorious by just two or three seats. Last Sunday's first round of voting to elect some 36,000 mayors across France had focused eyes on the conservative Paris, Lyon and Toulouse. In the capital, a feud between the rightist candidate, Philippe S\u00e9guin, and the outgoing mayor, Jean Tiberi, helped to hand victory to the Socialists. Last night, Mr S\u00e9guin said that he would have won if not for the \"iniquitous\" voting system.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Britain's general union, the GMB, is campaigning to give the taboo subject of domestic violence a voice in the workplace. The Daphne Project was recently launched nationwide in an attempt to offer support and understanding to victims of domestic violence within the world of work.</p> <p>\"Workers can't be expected to hang their emotions up in the cloakroom when they get to work. Good employers are concerned about their employees,\" says Karen Constantine, head of equal rights at the GMB. \"It's an issue that's been on the agenda for more than 10 years and it's evolved into a clear workplace issue for us.\" </p> <p> Whether or not employers choose to acknowledge domestic violence, many are fully aware that it exists, stresses Constantine. Workers invariably take time off as a result of domestic violence - poor attendance and punctuality are telltale signs. A recent study carried out by the American Federation for State County and Municipal Employees revealed that 56% of battered women were late for work five times a month, 28% of them left early five times a month and 54% missed at least three days work a month. More alarmingly, 74% of victims interviewed were even harassed while at work. </p> <p>Essentially a training system and workplace policy, The Daphne Project is targeting employers and trade union shop stewards to explain in detail the structures needed to support victims of abuse. It hopes to educate employers to detect signs of domestic violence and understand the myths surrounding the offence. Employers are asked to publicise the project at work and a commitment is sought to ensure the workplace is a secure environment from which victims can contact police and solicitors, and can even get help to find accommodation. When necessary, employers should also allow victims appropriate time off.</p> <p>Some may consider this a tall order, and certainly Amanda White, occupational psychologist and director of CGR Business Psychologists, has reservations. \"I think that it is generally a good thing that employers have their employees' interests at heart but there are major obstacles that need to be overcome in terms of implementing policies such as these. Some individuals may not want their problems aired at work. And even if they do, I'm not sure that managers have the necessary skills to deal with them,\" she says.</p> <p>Constantine dismisses this argument. \"We are not asking employers to take on the burden of dealing with an employee's domestic violence situation,\" she says, \"but to give them the space to deal with it in a safe environment. Quite often it's Human Resources (HR) people who deal with it and you have to bear in mind that HR people are often dealing with pretty nitty-gritty issues anyway.

      "bodyText": "Britain's general union, the GMB, is campaigning to give the taboo subject of domestic violence a voice in the workplace. The Daphne Project was recently launched nationwide in an attempt to offer support and understanding to victims of domestic violence within the world of work. \"Workers can't be expected to hang their emotions up in the cloakroom when they get to work. Good employers are concerned about their employees,\" says Karen Constantine, head of equal rights at the GMB. \"It's an issue that's been on the agenda for more than 10 years and it's evolved into a clear workplace issue for us.\" Whether or not employers choose to acknowledge domestic violence, many are fully aware that it exists, stresses Constantine. Workers invariably take time off as a result of domestic violence - poor attendance and punctuality are telltale signs. A recent study carried out by the American Federation for State County and Municipal Employees revealed that 56% of battered women were late for work five times a month, 28% of them left early five times a month and 54% missed at least three days work a month. More alarmingly, 74% of victims interviewed were even harassed while at work. Essentially a training system and workplace policy, The Daphne Project is targeting employers and trade union shop stewards to explain in detail the structures needed to support victims of abuse. It hopes to educate employers to detect signs of domestic violence and understand the myths surrounding the offence. Employers are asked to publicise the project at work and a commitment is sought to ensure the workplace is a secure environment from which victims can contact police and solicitors, and can even get help to find accommodation. When necessary, employers should also allow victims appropriate time off. Some may consider this a tall order, and certainly Amanda White, occupational psychologist and director of CGR Business Psychologists, has reservations. \"I think that it is generally a good thing that employers have their employees' interests at heart but there are major obstacles that need to be overcome in terms of implementing policies such as these. Some individuals may not want their problems aired at work. And even if they do, I'm not sure that managers have the necessary skills to deal with them,\" she says. Constantine dismisses this argument. \"We are not asking employers to take on the burden of dealing with an employee's domestic violence situation,\" she says, \"but to give them the space to deal with it in a safe environment. Quite often it's Human Resources (HR) people who deal with it and you have to bear in mind that HR people are often dealing with pretty nitty-gritty issues anyway. A lot of the responses from HR have welcomed the project because they've finally been given something very practical, some real guidance.\" Victims are overwhelmingly women - Constantine has never come across a male victim, but support under The Daphne Project would be offered to all, regardless of gender. White is aware that it is women who suffer and believes that in some work cultures acknowledging such personal problems would be perceived as a sign of weakness. Women are therefore often in a Catch 22 situation. \"In some macho cultures, women might not want to disclose that they are not managing their personal life too well because colleagues might think that they can't manage their professional life either. They may also feel that it damages their promotion prospects,\" she says. \"In these very cultures, I've run stress management courses and have been asked to change the name of the course to 'managing pressure' or 'managing pressure in others', because if it was called 'stress' no one would attend,\" says White. \"They wouldn't admit that they were suffering from stress.\" Exactly who victims should approach with domestic violence issues, and how they should do so, is not entirely clear-cut, but Constantine proposes line managers and supervisors as well as personnel departments. White, however, claims that managers in the industrial and commercial world are unprepared for such disclosures. \"Managers are OK when dealing with professional issues, but when it comes to the Kleenex issue it's not that they don't care, but they are very uncomfortable with that kind of closeness. It comes up time and again in my dealings with managers.\" But like it or not, managers may have to deal with it, or suffer the consequences. \"Domestic violence has an impact on an employee's self-esteem and confidence, which severely affects their ability to develop at work,\" says Constantine.

      "body": "<p>Before I begin, I'd like to point out to all my employers, past, future and most especially present, that the activities, tactics and gambits described below are not ones that I myself have ever engaged in. Honest. But I know that I'm somewhat unusual. From time to time even the most dedicated employee finds herself at a loose end, is a little bit tired, or just can't be bothered, quite frankly. Of course, it's not part of any sane person's career plan to let on to one's colleagues - they might give you some work to do for a start - which is where our advanced array of highly effective, albeit covert, time-wasting techniques comes into play. </p> <p>\u0095 Of course, there are times when time-wasting is all but expected. It's 4.30 on a Friday afternoon. Your colleagues have conspired to leave early, skive off for the day, or be otherwise occupied out of the office. You've been left holding the fort with a full packet of chocolate digestives and this month's issue of Marie Claire. And they really expect you to occupy your time with that bit of filing that's been hanging around since October? I don't think so. This is the time for personal phone calls, leafing through the Ikea catalogue and leaving half an hour early. Go on: how often do you have this much fun in the office? </p> <p>\u0095 Most of the time it's not that easy. Think of it as a battle of wills between them - intent on you finishing that report on next quarter's projected sales figures - and you - determined to see off your hangover in peace. Visit the toilet so frequently that your line manager suspects that you've developed a persistent bladder infection. While there, take the time to reapply a full face of make-up, imagine what you'd look like with any of 47 different hairstyles, and read the next chapter of the latest Jilly Cooper. You will find that senior management is remarkably reluctant to question what you've been up to in the WC. Who wants to find themselves embroiled in a discussion with their PA about cystitis treatments? Otherwise, wandering round the office, staring vacantly out of the window or hovering expectantly by the photocopier (no one need know you're not actually copying anything) will help pass those idle minutes. </p> <p>\u0095 Those with more hawk-eyed employers will have to use advanced techniques of shirking and slackness. The perfect technique for avoiding the work you should be doing is by doing work that is neither important, difficult nor your responsibility. For example, offer to run minor errands for other overworked colleagues. You will be surprised at how easily a brisk walk to the Post Office can encompass a detour via Top Shop or Kentucky Fried Chicken. Be taken by a sudden attack of generosity and make tea for the entire building. Yes, all 10 floors. Or proofread someone else's presentation - then sit staring intently at the same page for 45 minutes, chewing on your pen. Remember: if your sudden interest in helping out your workmates is mistaken for laziness, look wounded and confused. </p> <p>\u0095 As all office workers eventually realise, our working hours, although allowing for a decent social life and normal sleep patterns, are nevertheless totally unreasonable. How are we supposed to deal with the minutiae of our lives - banks, phone companies, pedicures - when we're meant to be working? It's not possible, of course, and if your employers will insist on having you in the office at such unreasonable times, it's only to be expected that from time to time you'll have to spend an hour on hold while trying to get through to the water board. In fact, why not just sit staring vacantly into space, phone clamped to your ear, making occasional irritated remarks about the terrible standards of customer service in this country? There's actually no need to phone anyone. </p> <p>\u0095 Email is the defining invention of the late 20th century. It will revolutionise the way we communicate, the way we work, the way we live. It's also, like, dead useful for sorting out what you're doing at the weekend. So it's a vital business tool - who cares as long as you've got a steady flow of gossip coming in from your friends? No doubt your boss fondly imagines that your email account is chock-full of work-related messages, or - if you're really being indulged - you confine any personal mailing to the five minutes before hometime. Sucker. As if you're really going to wait five hours before you spread the joyous news about your housemate, her boss, the living-room sofa and the tub of H\u00e4agen-Dazs. </p> <p>\u0095 The internet has all the benefits of email - instant, discreet, available at the click of a mouse - with the added incentive of online shopping. Let's just pause for a moment to appreciate the beauty of this invention. You don't have to move, you don't have to battle with malevolent pre-teens to get to the sale CDs in HMV, you don't have to think. It's shopping, only better. And your boss expects you not to use this? Is she mad? Even if your credit card has wilted, there's still a world of useless information to be explored. A vague notion about possibly going to the cinema flits across your mind and before you know it you're trawling though the Internet Movie Database and searching for recipes for homemade popcorn. And then you're back at georgeclooney.com. Again. </p> <p>\u0095 Sometimes, though, there is no alternative other than simply pretending to be working when you're not. Audio typists get a good deal here - put on your headphones, but plug them into the radio concealed under your desk, or just use them to block out unwanted sounds - the sound of your boss asking you to do something, for example. Otherwise, simply stare intently at your computer screen. Try to appear utterly absorbed in some highly complex task. Who's to know that you're only putting together that evening's shopping list? Or grab a willing colleague and head off to a quiet corner of the office for a vital meeting. Vital because you both really, really need to check out what Victoria Beckham is wearing in this month's OK! </p> <p>\u0095 If by now the guilt is beginning to prickle - but not so much that you actually want to attempt to get to grips with typing those letters - then move on to the fine art of procrastination. This is advanced level time-wasting - not so much work avoidance, as work juggling. You really should be putting together the itinerary for the Manchester trip, but don't you think it would be so much easier once you've completely tidied your desk? Or deleted all the old files from your computer? Or downloaded yourself a new screen-saver? Or invented a new filing system? You can easily spend hours, even days, avoiding odious tasks in this way and - shockingly - you might get some useful things done at the same time.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Before I begin, I'd like to point out to all my employers, past, future and most especially present, that the activities, tactics and gambits described below are not ones that I myself have ever engaged in. Honest. But I know that I'm somewhat unusual. From time to time even the most dedicated employee finds herself at a loose end, is a little bit tired, or just can't be bothered, quite frankly. Of course, it's not part of any sane person's career plan to let on to one's colleagues - they might give you some work to do for a start - which is where our advanced array of highly effective, albeit covert, time-wasting techniques comes into play. \u0095 Of course, there are times when time-wasting is all but expected. It's 4.30 on a Friday afternoon. Your colleagues have conspired to leave early, skive off for the day, or be otherwise occupied out of the office. You've been left holding the fort with a full packet of chocolate digestives and this month's issue of Marie Claire. And they really expect you to occupy your time with that bit of filing that's been hanging around since October? I don't think so. This is the time for personal phone calls, leafing through the Ikea catalogue and leaving half an hour early. Go on: how often do you have this much fun in the office? \u0095 Most of the time it's not that easy. Think of it as a battle of wills between them - intent on you finishing that report on next quarter's projected sales figures - and you - determined to see off your hangover in peace. Visit the toilet so frequently that your line manager suspects that you've developed a persistent bladder infection. While there, take the time to reapply a full face of make-up, imagine what you'd look like with any of 47 different hairstyles, and read the next chapter of the latest Jilly Cooper. You will find that senior management is remarkably reluctant to question what you've been up to in the WC. Who wants to find themselves embroiled in a discussion with their PA about cystitis treatments? Otherwise, wandering round the office, staring vacantly out of the window or hovering expectantly by the photocopier (no one need know you're not actually copying anything) will help pass those idle minutes. \u0095 Those with more hawk-eyed employers will have to use advanced techniques of shirking and slackness. The perfect technique for avoiding the work you should be doing is by doing work that is neither important, difficult nor your responsibility. For example, offer to run minor errands for other overworked colleagues. You will be surprised at how easily a brisk walk to the Post Office can encompass a detour via Top Shop or Kentucky Fried Chicken. Be taken by a sudden attack of generosity and make tea for the entire building. Yes, all 10 floors. Or proofread someone else's presentation - then sit staring intently at the same page for 45 minutes, chewing on your pen. Remember: if your sudden interest in helping out your workmates is mistaken for laziness, look wounded and confused. \u0095 As all office workers eventually realise, our working hours, although allowing for a decent social life and normal sleep patterns, are nevertheless totally unreasonable. How are we supposed to deal with the minutiae of our lives - banks, phone companies, pedicures - when we're meant to be working? It's not possible, of course, and if your employers will insist on having you in the office at such unreasonable times, it's only to be expected that from time to time you'll have to spend an hour on hold while trying to get through to the water board. In fact, why not just sit staring vacantly into space, phone clamped to your ear, making occasional irritated remarks about the terrible standards of customer service in this country? There's actually no need to phone anyone. \u0095 Email is the defining invention of the late 20th century. It will revolutionise the way we communicate, the way we work, the way we live. It's also, like, dead useful for sorting out what you're doing at the weekend. So it's a vital business tool - who cares as long as you've got a steady flow of gossip coming in from your friends? No doubt your boss fondly imagines that your email account is chock-full of work-related messages, or - if you're really being indulged - you confine any personal mailing to the five minutes before hometime. Sucker. As if you're really going to wait five hours before you spread the joyous news about your housemate, her boss, the living-room sofa and the tub of H\u00e4agen-Dazs. \u0095 The internet has all the benefits of email - instant, discreet, available at the click of a mouse - with the added incentive of online shopping. Let's just pause for a moment to appreciate the beauty of this invention. You don't have to move, you don't have to battle with malevolent pre-teens to get to the sale CDs in HMV, you don't have to think. It's shopping, only better. And your boss expects you not to use this? Is she mad? Even if your credit card has wilted, there's still a world of useless information to be explored. A vague notion about possibly going to the cinema flits across your mind and before you know it you're trawling though the Internet Movie Database and searching for recipes for homemade popcorn. And then you're back at georgeclooney.com. Again. \u0095 Sometimes, though, there is no alternative other than simply pretending to be working when you're not. Audio typists get a good deal here - put on your headphones, but plug them into the radio concealed under your desk, or just use them to block out unwanted sounds - the sound of your boss asking you to do something, for example. Otherwise, simply stare intently at your computer screen. Try to appear utterly absorbed in some highly complex task. Who's to know that you're only putting together that evening's shopping list? Or grab a willing colleague and head off to a quiet corner of the office for a vital meeting. Vital because you both really, really need to check out what Victoria Beckham is wearing in this month's OK! \u0095 If by now the guilt is beginning to prickle - but not so much that you actually want to attempt to get to grips with typing those letters - then move on to the fine art of procrastination. This is advanced level time-wasting - not so much work avoidance, as work juggling. You really should be putting together the itinerary for the Manchester trip, but don't you think it would be so much easier once you've completely tidied your desk? Or deleted all the old files from your computer? Or downloaded yourself a new screen-saver? Or invented a new filing system? You can easily spend hours, even days, avoiding odious tasks in this way and - shockingly - you might get some useful things done at the same time.",

The idea is that the City of London will have the look of a central business district (CBD) along the lines of, say, Sydney, Hong Kong, Shanghai or Los Angeles. Other European cities are creating just such towering CBDs; the City of London doesn't want to fall behind either Frankfurt or Canary Wharf in its own backyard. </p> <p>Clusters of city office blocks are in vogue. Not only do they form a powerful economic hub, but they also help keep dense property development contained within specific areas of cities rather than spread through them, as happened in the heyday of Euston and Centre Point towers. They also form picturesque cityscapes, most famously in Manhattan. Grouped, the skyscrapers of New York, Chicago and Sydney fascinate from a distance.

      "body": "<p>The faces of the customs officers at Australia's international airports are creased with worry.</p> <p>Sniffer dogs in hand, they are working overtime during the foot and mouth crisis in an attempt to keep the country free from the disease. There are draconian restrictions on what you can bring into Australia and even after a 24-hour flight, every tourist from Britain is searched and their shoes scrubbed with disinfectant.</p> <p>If the disease breaks out in Australia it will be a calamity for the country, whose economy - now dipping into recession - depends on its multibillion dollar farming industry far more than in the UK.</p> <p>But there is one group of Australians who are profiting from the foot and mouth crisis across the world. Demand for the flesh of Australia's national icon, the kangaroo, has jumped by 20% in Europe this year as the BSE scare and the foot and mouth outbreak dent consumer confidence.</p> <p>The kangaroo industry is racing to supply new markets in eastern Europe, who would normally buy cheap cuts of beef from the European Union. Bargain-basement kangaroo meat is now being used instead to make salami and sausages in countries such as Russia, Romania and Serbia.</p> <p>The Kangaroo Industry Association of Australia (KIAA) says that most of the 20% increase comes from sales to Germany, France, Holland and Belgium, which with their strong tradition of eating wild meat have naturally taken to kangaroo. Demand in Britain remains relatively low because it doesn't have much of an appetite for game cuisine, says John Kelly of KIAA.</p> <p>Animal rights groups continue to strongly object to the consumption of kangaroo, which takes pride of place on Australia's coat of arms. But, traditionally used in pet food and for leather football boots, human consumption of the versatile marsupial in Australia has increased 50-fold in the last decade. Many of the country's top restaurants now offer high quality kangaroo steaks along with other innovative \"bush tucker\" dishes.</p> <p>\"It's cheap, it's safe, it's clean and green. High quality kangaroo meat tastes a little bit like deer and folk say it's good for you,\" says Don Cairns, a senior Australian trade commissioner based in Bucharest.</p> <p>Chefs extol kangaroo's flavour and leanness. The marsupial only eats grass and has an active \"free range\" lifestyle, which means it contains less than 2% fat, of which 48% is healthy polyunsaturated fat.

      "bodyText": "The faces of the customs officers at Australia's international airports are creased with worry. Sniffer dogs in hand, they are working overtime during the foot and mouth crisis in an attempt to keep the country free from the disease. There are draconian restrictions on what you can bring into Australia and even after a 24-hour flight, every tourist from Britain is searched and their shoes scrubbed with disinfectant. If the disease breaks out in Australia it will be a calamity for the country, whose economy - now dipping into recession - depends on its multibillion dollar farming industry far more than in the UK. But there is one group of Australians who are profiting from the foot and mouth crisis across the world. Demand for the flesh of Australia's national icon, the kangaroo, has jumped by 20% in Europe this year as the BSE scare and the foot and mouth outbreak dent consumer confidence. The kangaroo industry is racing to supply new markets in eastern Europe, who would normally buy cheap cuts of beef from the European Union. Bargain-basement kangaroo meat is now being used instead to make salami and sausages in countries such as Russia, Romania and Serbia. The Kangaroo Industry Association of Australia (KIAA) says that most of the 20% increase comes from sales to Germany, France, Holland and Belgium, which with their strong tradition of eating wild meat have naturally taken to kangaroo. Demand in Britain remains relatively low because it doesn't have much of an appetite for game cuisine, says John Kelly of KIAA. Animal rights groups continue to strongly object to the consumption of kangaroo, which takes pride of place on Australia's coat of arms. But, traditionally used in pet food and for leather football boots, human consumption of the versatile marsupial in Australia has increased 50-fold in the last decade. Many of the country's top restaurants now offer high quality kangaroo steaks along with other innovative \"bush tucker\" dishes. \"It's cheap, it's safe, it's clean and green. High quality kangaroo meat tastes a little bit like deer and folk say it's good for you,\" says Don Cairns, a senior Australian trade commissioner based in Bucharest. Chefs extol kangaroo's flavour and leanness. The marsupial only eats grass and has an active \"free range\" lifestyle, which means it contains less than 2% fat, of which 48% is healthy polyunsaturated fat. The meat is also high in iron. There are 35 million kangaroos hopping around Australia. None are farmed yet, but each year national parks officers assess how many can be culled sustainably, usually ruling that up to 10% of the kangaroo population can be killed. Still in its infancy, the kangaroo industry has yet to fill any of its quotas. Mr Kelly says: \"It is environmentally wise for us in Australia to produce our food from animals that belong here, rather than use introduced exotics like sheep and cattle which cause considerable environmental damage.\" Unlike hard-hoofed animals, such as sheep, native kangaroos have soft pads, which cause less damage to Australia's fragile plains. \"Harvesting\" wild kangaroos has far less of an impact on the land than the high-intensity farming of beef cattle, for which forests are often cleared. Red and grey kangaroos are not threatened species. But the Australian Conservation Foundation says that although some culling operations could be justified, it opposes the commercial hunting of wild kangaroos, while any proposals for kangaroo farming should be subject to stringent environmental controls. \"We're pretty cautious about kangaroo farming because local circumstances can dictate the sustainability of farming practices,\" says Charlie Sherwin, an ACF spokesperson. \"Producers should be required to prove that their operations won't adversely affect the ecology, genetics or sustainability of wild or captive kangaroo populations.\" Email patrick.barkham@theguardian.com Other articles More articles by Patrick Barkham Useful links The Kangaroo Industry Association of Australia Sydney Morning Herald Australia Broadcasting Corporation The Age Asia Pulse",

Every morning when she walked in, her male colleagues would try to guess what underwear she had on. \"Camisole!\" they would yell. Or, \"French knickers!\" One of 25 women brokers among 300 men, she would pass the bank of desks while its occupants crouched and craned to verify their guesses. It was like a building site, she says, only all the blokes were wearing suits. </p> <p>The gap between modern standards of behaviour and those practised in the City widened again last week, when the Japanese finance house, Nomura, paid out \u00a370,000 to Isabelle Terrillon, one of its former brokers. Terrillon, 35, returned from maternity leave three years ago to find that her job no longer existed. At a tribunal in Stratford, east London, she described Nomura as the kind of place in which a male colleague would declare, loudly enough for her to hear, that \"of all the women on the dealing floor, the one he really wanted to fuck was [Isabelle]\". </p> <p>During a client meeting, Terrillon said she was asked to strip down and administer a massage to one of her colleagues. If she showed displeasure, she was asked whether or not she was \"going to start crying\". Last Monday, she dropped the sexual discrimination claim and accepted a \u00a370,000 out-of-court settlement for unfair dismissal. </p> <p>Behaviour in the City is traditionally graded between the extremes of yobbish brokerage and genteel corporate finance. Brokerage, it is imagined, is a gladiatorial arena in which everyone is mean to everyone else, while corporate finance is a euphemism for \"gentlemanly\". According to women who have worked in both, however, it is not the degree of sexism that differs so much as its expression, which by subtle means is as alive now as it was during the 1980s. Over the past five years, the Equal Opportunities Commission has taken on 35 cases of sex discrimination from workers in the City, six of which have been successful. \"Many of them settle before they get to court,\" says a spokeswoman, who believes that these figures are a drop in the ocean. </p> <p>\"Most City males think the world is divided into three types of women,\" says one former analyst. \"The sweet, virginal, Julia Roberts look-a-like who responds with delighted giggles to any sort of \"perfectly normal workplace banter\", yet is desperate to don crotchless knickers and give the boss a blow-job. Then there are the mothers - unreliable because not only did they go and get pregnant, but they have the nerve to clock off early if a child breaks an arm. And then there is the largest group of women - the humourless bitches.\" </p> <p>For 10 years, Helen Cartwright was a money broker for an international Swiss bank, one of six women among 250 men. She earned \u00a380,000 a year. \"It was like a cartoon,\" she says. \"The men in the office would say: 'When are you going to go home, get married and have babies?' The more they put me down, the better they were regarded by the others.\" </p> <p>On the off chance that they would \"get lucky\", Cartwright's male colleagues would book rooms by the hour at London hotels such as the Strand Palace or the Great Eastern Hotel and try to persuade her to return there with them. On one occasion, a male colleague approached Cartwright's desk, undid his flies, and exposed the stitches of his recent circumcision to her. She told him to put it away or she would hit it with the phone. </p> <p>\"The nastiest thing they ever did was when I split up with my ex-husband. They talked very loudly about the new girl he was seeing. It was devastating. I lost a stone and a half in two weeks.\" Cartwright eventually left the bank and received an out-of-court settlement on the condition that she never disclosed its value. </p> <p>These were not the sort of circumstances into which Laura Browning imagined she was entering. After leaving a relatively civilised US company, she joined a more traditional British merchant bank as a middle-ranking executive. </p> <p>\"If I'd had a tape recorder, I could have taken them to the cleaners,\" she says. \"I had a very swashbuckling client, who required long meetings late into the night and at weekends. During one meeting, this man cleared a boardroom of 30 people by saying: 'Could all of you please leave while I speak to Linda.' Once they had left, he actually chased me round the boardroom. It was unbelievable. Part of me wanted to laugh, the other to slap him.\" </p> <p>When the client persisted in commenting on Davies's clothes and tried to grab her again, she took the matter to a senior director. \"My dear,\" he said, \"did no one ever tell you the customer is always right?\" The subtext, says Davies, was that if the client wanted to sleep with her, then she should let him. \"I went straight to a headhunter and said get me out of here\". </p> <p>This kind of overt grappling has been replaced, recently, by more covert forms of intimidation, much favoured by litigation-weary bankers. \"It is about the subtle discounting of ability,\" says Helena Dennison, chair of the City Women's Network, which represents 200 senior female executives working in the Square Mile. \"Covert discrimination means rubbishing a woman's contribution during meetings, either with snide remarks or remarks about her appearance. Covert discrimination undermines confidence.\" </p> <p>The language of sexism grows more respectable the further up a company you go, becomes more subtle and harder to censure. When she worked on the trading floor, Cartwright says women were referred to as \"tarts, slappers and dogs\". </p> <p>\"In a funny way, I think overt sexism is easier to deal with,\" says a former analyst who worked in a US firm for five years. \"What I experienced was a constant undercurrent which, without anyone saying it, ensured that women knew their place. It was clear that only attractive females were being hired. There was an atmosphere of testosterone which meant clients were taken to lap-dancing clubs, places where women would be uncomfortable.\" </p> <p>Every morning, her boss would walk past his secretary and say: \"Show me your tits.\" One morning after months of this, she did. (He never asked again.) \"There was an under-lying feeling that you would never get on. You only had to look at the number of female executives to know that you had no future.\" </p> <p>While the average intake in a City firm is divided equally between the sexes, only 3% of executives at the highest level are women. According to the Equal Opportunities Commission, women working full-time in banking and finance currently earn 55% of their male counterparts' earnings. \"Sexism is more dangerous now,\" says Justine Burgess, who used to work in international equity. When her boss pulled her on to his knee or massaged her shoulders when she was on the phone to a client, she found it relatively easy to diffuse. \"I could laugh it off,\" she says. </p> <p>\"The men used to get their willies out, but you'd just learn to put up with it,\" says Sue Temple. \"You deal with it because everyone is in the same boat. There was no point complaining. Women had to take it on the chin.\" </p> <p>\"What is more difficult,\" says Burgess, \"is an environment in which you get fewer daily comments, but a lot of subtle discrimination over promotions and pay.\" One of her friends has just filed suit against a merchant bank after being passed over for promotion because, she suspects, she couldn't play golf. \"She was out of that whole guy thing and although she brought in as much revenue as the rest of them, they froze her out.\" </p> <p>Dennison believes many woman don't take their grievances to court for fear of gaining reputations as troublemakers. \"If you were making \u00a3300,000 a year, would you jeopardise your career by speaking out against the firm?\" Deutsche Bank, which last year paid an estimated \u00a3500,000 in damages to a female banker after her manager publicly accused her of sleeping with a male client, could not, despite numerous requests, rustle up anyone to discuss its harassment policy. One analyst said: \"The problem with these places is that they don't take their human resources departments seriously. They see them as a service rather than a critical part of the company.\" Most of her female colleagues, she says, look straight past toothless personnel sections to the courts for redress. </p> <p>Against the odds, Isabelle Terrillon has found another job in the City. Laura Browning, after a \"dehumanising\" spell on the trading floor, left to write financial thrillers. Temple gave as good as she got for seven years and now practises as a healer in Brighton. Justine Burgess had a child and moved from equity into the more civilised field of financial headhunting. Cartwright is an estate agent in Tunbridge Wells. She has a favourite exchange from her time in the City, which she tells with a vigorous but bitter irony. \"I don't like women\", a male colleague once volunteered. Cartwright allowed a short pause before replying: \"So leave.\"</p>",

Her secret weapon is actress Megan Casey, the Headgear Girl of the title, whose elaborate toothbrace looks like a cross between a fondue set and a radio mast, condemning her to life as the class scapegoat. Casey's spare performance, alternately stoical and coltishly optimistic, shines out of the smallest of screens. (KS) \u0095 View the film Ghost of Stephen Foster (www.ifilm.com) This cheerfully retro black and white cartoon started life as the music video accompanying an equally cheerful ditty by off-beat band, the Squirrel Nut Zippers. Their oompah kletzmer sound makes a neat fit with the giddy and skilful Max Fleischer-style animation adopted by director Raymond Persi. Goggle as a Betty Boop-alike and her beau are chased around the haunted Hotel Paradise by everybody from the bellboy to the bedbugs. All underpinned by the catchy pastiche title tune - \"The Camptown Ladies NEVER sang all the doo-dah day\" apparently. (KS) \u0095 View the film",

Everyone here is ready to party like it's 1981 - at least, they've come prepared with lashings of eyeliner. Almond wears a peroxide blond quiff, a black top that sparkles and wide trousers that swish; as he struts around the stage, throwing robotic dance moves and entreating the crowd to sing Memorabilia, it's like the past 20 years never happened. </p> <p>The outpouring of affection is surprising considering Soft Cell's short - though glittering - career. Almond and colleague Dave Ball split in 1984 after just four years of pop stardom, ending the stream of seedy glamour and unrestrained sexuality they brought to the charts and an unlikely but successful relationship. Ball maintains the prerequisite glum visage, but he's clearly happy standing behind his bank of electronic equipment. Almond, meanwhile, is a nonstop ball of enthusiasm, excitement and emotion. His dramatics are almost as impressive as his rich voice, with faux displays of tragedy and a bouncing, arm-waving joy. </p> <p>But then drama was always Soft Cell's defining characteristic. Ball's electronic scribblings consist largely of a repetitive beat that creates a feeling of unease; while that worms its way under your skin, delicate trumpet and piano add colour to the urban sound. Almond stands at the front of the stage, leading the audience in a rendition of Youth, joining them for another soaring vocal, his flourishes filling in the blank spaces between the beats. </p> <p>Nostalgia has sold the tickets (and the venue is packed), but the duo also choose to play a couple of new, unreleased songs. \"Apparently we sound too much like Soft Cell,\" Almond remarks. \"People we've played them to say: 'Can't you make it sound like the Chemical Brothers?'\" It's fair to say that Divided Souls - inspired by Marvin Gaye - isn't big beat, but it is the kind of detail-laden, down-at-heel song that Soft Cell do best, a poppy tale of introspection and isolation. </p> <p>The songs go on for a bit too long, but when they include the squalid but beautiful Bedsitter, it's forgivable. Tainted Love is fantastic, the magic made greater by its slow-burning fusion into the Supremes' Where Did Our Love Go? Almond shakes his hips as he whacks the drum machine, but on Say Hello Wave Goodbye he is almost redundant, his attempt to sing the song a little bit faster than usual shot down in flames by the crowd who know exactly how it should be done.

To prove the point his latest play is packed with a mix of exquisite literary banter and subversive modernism that sets the mind reeling - but the dazzling repartee is slightly in excess of the actual narrative incident. </p> <p>As if to answer the charge that his plays are often hermetically male, Mamet has here come up with a work exclusively female. The title refers to the intimate relationship between two women fashionable in late 19th-century New England; Mamet deals with the point of crisis in just such a marriage.

      "bodyText": "\"It is easier to write great dialogue than to write great plots,\" David Mamet once confessed. To prove the point his latest play is packed with a mix of exquisite literary banter and subversive modernism that sets the mind reeling - but the dazzling repartee is slightly in excess of the actual narrative incident. As if to answer the charge that his plays are often hermetically male, Mamet has here come up with a work exclusively female. The title refers to the intimate relationship between two women fashionable in late 19th-century New England; Mamet deals with the point of crisis in just such a marriage. Anna, for fiscal reasons, has taken a married male lover from whom she has acquired a stipend and an emerald necklace. Her partner, Claire, is besotted with a young girl whom she has invited to the house for the purpose of seduction. The shock revelation comes from the realisation that Anna's lover and Claire's inamorata are themselves closely connected. But the plot is the least impressive aspect of Boston Marriage.

For a brief period in the 1890s it seemed as though the young Finnish composer would achieve with the Nordic legends what Wagner had with the Teutonic myths - until he travelled to Bayreuth, saw Parsifal and panicked. This crisis-of-confidence resolved, Sibelius buried himself in the scores of Liszt and set out his stall as a future symphonist. </p> <p>All but forgotten, The Maiden in the Tower has awaited a full British performance until now. The BBC Philharmonic acquitted themselves stoically under the extremely capable hands of the excellent Estonian conductor Paavo Jarvi. But regrettably, like the opera's titular heroine, it might have been kinder not to let it out. </p> <p>Whereas Sibelius's more promising early operatic essay, The Building of the Boat, never made it to the water, The Maiden in the Tower did reach completion, probably because it was commissioned as a benefit in aid of the Helsinki Philharmonic Society in 1896. There is scarcely a bar, however, in which Sibelius went beyond the call of duty. A slim-line rescue opera in an almost indecent hurry, the heroine is abducted, incarcerated, calumnied, rescued and redeemed, all in 40 hectic minutes. It is unactable, and with Rafael Hertzberg's libretto including lines as wretched as \"for gold and gloss her honour and her faith she lost\", it was a mercy that the four soloists were singing in Swedish. </p> <p>With the rising young baritone Garry Magee and the eloquent Norwegian soprano Solveig Kringelborn on the platform there were some fine voices here; it's a pity Sibelius didn't want you to hear them. The problem of balance was not something that the young composer had addressed, nor that Jarvi could do much about. The fussiness of Sibelius's vocal accompaniments meant that by the time the contralto arrives like a haughty schoolmistress to tell everyone to behave themselves, it was impossible for Lilli Paasikivi to make an impression. Only the brightness of Lars-Erik Jonsson's Helden-tenorish tone occasionally broke through the orchestral clouds. Sibelius devotees can hear the concert repeated on Radio 3. Everyone else can happily wait another 100 years for the next revival. </p> <p>\u0095 This concert is broadcast on Radio 3 tomorrow.</p>",
