In the meantime, housing authorities and local councils have been asked to draw up costing plans for several of his proposals. Research from the Council of Mortgage Lenders found that three-quarters of those surveyed want to own their own homes within the next two years.

      "body": "<p>Want to retire with \u00a325,000 a year? You'd better start saving now and start saving lots. A 25-year-old man hoping to retire at 65 would need to put away \u00a3212.47 a month to secure a pension of \u00a325,000 a year. If that sounds like a lot, then you'd better hope you're not much older than 25. </p> <p>Assuming a pension fund growth rate of 4.5% a year, a 35-year-old would need to put away \u00a3372.27. And if you're older than 35 I wouldn't recommend looking at the box on the right (showing how much a man hoping to retire at 65 would have to save to get \u00a325,000 a year); you probably have more chance of winning the Lottery than meeting the monthly payments. </p> <p>In short, for a variety of reasons, including the fact that we are living longer and are accustomed to a higher standard of living than our predecessors, retirement is an expensive business. </p> <p>The problem is that many of us don't appear to be aware of this. New research from AXA Sun Life found the target group for the government's stakeholder pensions - the self-employed, part-timers and those who move jobs frequently - is putting away nowhere near the required amount for a comfortable retirement. Four out of six respondents said they were confident about their financial well-being in retirement, but the survey found that only one in six were making sufficient savings. </p> <p>And while half of all respondents expect to retire before 60, the survey found that unless they start saving significantly more, most will be retiring at 65 with an income below the poverty line - ie an income of around \u00a38,000 a year, barely enough to cover the basics. </p> <p>Interestingly, most of those surveyed seem to have accepted that the \"rolling back\" of the welfare state is set to continue and that they should make private arrangements for a variety of services which, until now, have been provided by the state. For example, four in 10 of all respondents anticipate having to pay in part or in full for hospital treatment in retirement, whilst 73% expect to pay for residential care and 63% for transport. Why this has not prompted people to make adequate private arrangements for their retirement is unclear. A lack of awareness of the amount of money required is an obvious explanation. But there is also evidence that people are considering other financial products instead of a pension. </p> <p>The AXA Sun Life study found that bank or building society accounts, endowment policies, Isas, unit trusts, and life assurance bonds are all popular savings vehicles for retirement.

      "bodyText": "Want to retire with \u00a325,000 a year? You'd better start saving now and start saving lots. A 25-year-old man hoping to retire at 65 would need to put away \u00a3212.47 a month to secure a pension of \u00a325,000 a year. If that sounds like a lot, then you'd better hope you're not much older than 25. Assuming a pension fund growth rate of 4.5% a year, a 35-year-old would need to put away \u00a3372.27. And if you're older than 35 I wouldn't recommend looking at the box on the right (showing how much a man hoping to retire at 65 would have to save to get \u00a325,000 a year); you probably have more chance of winning the Lottery than meeting the monthly payments. In short, for a variety of reasons, including the fact that we are living longer and are accustomed to a higher standard of living than our predecessors, retirement is an expensive business. The problem is that many of us don't appear to be aware of this. New research from AXA Sun Life found the target group for the government's stakeholder pensions - the self-employed, part-timers and those who move jobs frequently - is putting away nowhere near the required amount for a comfortable retirement. Four out of six respondents said they were confident about their financial well-being in retirement, but the survey found that only one in six were making sufficient savings. And while half of all respondents expect to retire before 60, the survey found that unless they start saving significantly more, most will be retiring at 65 with an income below the poverty line - ie an income of around \u00a38,000 a year, barely enough to cover the basics. Interestingly, most of those surveyed seem to have accepted that the \"rolling back\" of the welfare state is set to continue and that they should make private arrangements for a variety of services which, until now, have been provided by the state. For example, four in 10 of all respondents anticipate having to pay in part or in full for hospital treatment in retirement, whilst 73% expect to pay for residential care and 63% for transport. Why this has not prompted people to make adequate private arrangements for their retirement is unclear. A lack of awareness of the amount of money required is an obvious explanation. But there is also evidence that people are considering other financial products instead of a pension. The AXA Sun Life study found that bank or building society accounts, endowment policies, Isas, unit trusts, and life assurance bonds are all popular savings vehicles for retirement. In addition, 42% of respondents expect to work part-time during their retirement to supplement their income, while 30% expect a windfall or inheritance lump-sum and a further 30% plan to sell their property. The findings make bleak reading for the retirees of the future. The pensions message was always start saving early and reap the benefits later on, yet the 41% of AXA respondents who have been putting away a set amount each month since their 20s will not be reaping sufficient benefits later on. Most people in the stakeholder pension target group put about \u00a365 a month into a retirement plan, a far cry from the amounts that are deemed necessary for a comfortable old age, and cannot afford to increase their instalments. The figure for average monthly payments into other pension funds, such as company schemes, also falls short at \u00a3150 a month.",

      "body": "<p>Marjorie Scardino's reshaping of media group Pearson took another enormous leap yesterday with the \u00a312bn merger of the company's television production business with Luxembourg-based broadcast and radio group CLT Ufa. </p> <p>The deal brings together 160 Pearson programmes including Baywatch, Neighbours and The Bill, with a network of 22 television channels and 18 radio stations, creating Europe's biggest broadcasting business. </p> <p>The combined company will have revenues of \u20ac3.8bn - higher than Canal Plus, KirchMedia or BSkyB. Shares in Pearson climbed 251p to \u00a323.04, around twice their value 12 months ago, as the market gave the merger its resounding support. </p> <p>Ms Scardino said the business is going to be \"a real pow erhouse with the scale and resources to take opportunities\" in both the conventional and new media sectors. \"This deal creates great value that we could not create alone. It puts Pearson TV at the heart of one of Europe's most extensive and most popular broadcasting networks,\" she said. </p> <p>The merger also had the effect of building a dominant 65% stake in Channel 5 by combining the assets of Pearson and CLT. </p> <p>Pearson will have just 22% of the new business with CLT shareholder Bertelsmann, the privately owned German media empire and Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, a Belgian investment group, having 30% each. The assets are being pooled in a holding company, Audiofina, which will be renamed and listed on the London stock exchange. </p> <p>German publisher WAZ has a further 7% while the re maining 11% will be free float. Ms Scardino denied charges that Pearson was using the deal as an elegant exit from the TV business and said the com pany would remain \"in there for the long term\". Ms Scardino and Pearson finance director John Makinson will be on the board of the new business. </p> <p>Paul Richards, media analyst at West LB Panmure, described the combination as a \"splendid\" deal. </p> <p>\"This is a winning formula of content plus distribution. When Marjorie arrived at Pearson she had half a dozen businesses, none of which were at the top of their markets, and she has operated a double or quits strategy. Either get out, as she has with leisure or investment banking, or double in size, as Pearson has already done with education through the Simon &amp; Schuster acquisition. The TV deal falls into the latter category.\" </p> <p>Bertelsmann chief executive Thomas Middlehoff said the new combine would hold talks with Vivendi's French pay-TV operator Canal Plus over possible joint ventures in sports and film rights, and would also seek to build on its US foothold through acquisitions. </p> <p>Richard Eyre, who quit as chief executive of the ITV Network to run Pearson's TV business, will continue to have responsibility for the production business and has been given the chairmanship at Channel 5.

      "bodyText": "Marjorie Scardino's reshaping of media group Pearson took another enormous leap yesterday with the \u00a312bn merger of the company's television production business with Luxembourg-based broadcast and radio group CLT Ufa. The deal brings together 160 Pearson programmes including Baywatch, Neighbours and The Bill, with a network of 22 television channels and 18 radio stations, creating Europe's biggest broadcasting business. The combined company will have revenues of \u20ac3.8bn - higher than Canal Plus, KirchMedia or BSkyB. Shares in Pearson climbed 251p to \u00a323.04, around twice their value 12 months ago, as the market gave the merger its resounding support. Ms Scardino said the business is going to be \"a real pow erhouse with the scale and resources to take opportunities\" in both the conventional and new media sectors. \"This deal creates great value that we could not create alone. It puts Pearson TV at the heart of one of Europe's most extensive and most popular broadcasting networks,\" she said. The merger also had the effect of building a dominant 65% stake in Channel 5 by combining the assets of Pearson and CLT. Pearson will have just 22% of the new business with CLT shareholder Bertelsmann, the privately owned German media empire and Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, a Belgian investment group, having 30% each. The assets are being pooled in a holding company, Audiofina, which will be renamed and listed on the London stock exchange. German publisher WAZ has a further 7% while the re maining 11% will be free float. Ms Scardino denied charges that Pearson was using the deal as an elegant exit from the TV business and said the com pany would remain \"in there for the long term\". Ms Scardino and Pearson finance director John Makinson will be on the board of the new business. Paul Richards, media analyst at West LB Panmure, described the combination as a \"splendid\" deal. \"This is a winning formula of content plus distribution. When Marjorie arrived at Pearson she had half a dozen businesses, none of which were at the top of their markets, and she has operated a double or quits strategy. Either get out, as she has with leisure or investment banking, or double in size, as Pearson has already done with education through the Simon &amp; Schuster acquisition. The TV deal falls into the latter category.\" Bertelsmann chief executive Thomas Middlehoff said the new combine would hold talks with Vivendi's French pay-TV operator Canal Plus over possible joint ventures in sports and film rights, and would also seek to build on its US foothold through acquisitions. Richard Eyre, who quit as chief executive of the ITV Network to run Pearson's TV business, will continue to have responsibility for the production business and has been given the chairmanship at Channel 5. Didier Bellens, the chief executive of CLT, will take the same role in the new group. CLT has TV channels in 11 European countries with over 120m viewers a day. Its assets include the RTL brand in Germany, the Netherlands and parts of eastern Europe, and the M6 Group in France. It also operates one of mainland Europe's leading sports rights businesses, more than 70 websites and TV production in Germany. Pearson TV, which represents some 10% of group revenues, has production bases in 35 countries and a library of 17,500 hours. It owns game show formats including The Price is Right and Family Feud, both hit shows in the US.

      "body": "<p>Job sharing, where two people share the duties, pay and benefits of one full-time post, is becoming the upmarket face of part-time working. </p> <p>Where part-time working in the UK has tended to be associated with low-skilled, poorly-paid and insecure jobs: \"Job sharing has become an accepted way of introducing part-time hours into jobs which have traditionally only been available on a full-time basis, particularly at senior and managerial level,\" says New Ways to Work, a London-based organisation advising on more flexible working arrangements. \"It opens up the possibility of doing professional and skilled work on a less than full-time basis, which may not otherwise be possible.\" </p> <p>This was certainly the case seven years ago for Lindsay Porter, now a job sharing district personnel manager for Sainsbury's. After taking a four-year career gap to have a family, Ms Porter had rejoined the group on a part-time basis as a temporary personnel manager working on new store openings in the north. When the project finished, the company wanted the job to become a full-time post, something Ms Porter was not interested in as the mother of a young family. </p> <p>\"My boss at the time was very forward thinking and suggested that I and another part-time personnel manager, who also would have left the company rather than go full-time, formulate a job share. The company was able to retain the skills of two people who otherwise would have left. It was the first job share at that level in Sainsbury's,\" she says. \"Job sharing meant I was able to secure a permanent appointment and dovetail my homelife and raising my family with a career. It has also allowed me to be promoted to the next level.\" </p> <p>For the past three years Ms Porter has shared the job of district personnel manager, responsible for 16 stores in the north east, Yorkshire and Humberside, with partner Karen Gregory, who made a deliberate choice to go part-time to improve the quality of her life. </p> <p>\"We work in a world where jobs and careers tend to predominate to the exclusion of other things,\" Ms Gregory says. \"By job sharing I'm able to pursue the career I want and yet grow outside of the role through pursuing other interests. I feel I've gained from having a balance in my life.\" </p> <p>At the last count (Labour Market Survey autumn '97), some 0.8% of UK employees - 177,000 people - were working on a job sharing basis, of whom 89% were women. And an increasing number of organisations are now offering job sharing at management levels. </p> <p>The major high street banks, Marks &amp; Spencer, Nationwide (see panel), Oxford County Council, Boots, BP and PowerGen and most local authorities in London now have official job share schemes, while many others offer job shares on an ad-hoc basis. </p> <p>But still the majority of job shares exist at administrative and secretarial levels, according to Angela Baron, an adviser at the Institute of Personnel and Development (IPD). \"There are some high-profile examples of job shares at senior levels, but they are few and far between,\" she says. \"The reality is that the idea of splitting senior jobs frightens many organisations. They argue that jobs with a high level of responsibility must be done full-time by one person and can't be split between two part-timers, who will be less committed and will lose control of things during hand-overs.\" </p> <p>But these arguments don't stand up, says Ms Baron, who cites the examples of senior, round-the-clock jobs such as ward sister or hotel duty manager. \"These are highly responsible, 24-hour-a-day jobs which have traditionally been 'job shared'. One person is in charge, but it's not the same person 24 hours a day. So it shouldn't be that hard to share the responsibilities of senior management roles in modern, flexible organisations. Job shares tend to work very successfully and bring many benefits to the employer.\" </p> <p>Job shares give employers the chance to bring two sets of skills and experience to a post and retain qualified and trained employees who might otherwise leave. </p> <p>As job share partners typically arrange their holidays at different times and fill in for each other when ill, employers get better cover and continuity than they would from one person doing the job. </p> <p>As Karen Gregory and Lindsay Porter each do three days a week and stagger their holidays, the advantages to Sainsbury's includes six days a week cover for most of the year with at least three days a week during holiday periods. The partners are very flexible in terms of the days they work. All important meetings and events are covered by at least one of the two women and, on occasions where the business requires it, both will agree to work full-time temporarily. </p> <p>The only cost to the company for these extra benefits is doubling up on some employee benefits. Both women get a company car, private health cover, a mobile phone and a home computer system which allows them to retrieve e-mails from work. </p> <p>The onus to prove to employers that job shares can succeed, particularly at more senior levels, inevitably falls on pioneering partners. Ms Porter and Ms Gregory share their job by each performing the full range of tasks, with no division of duties, though they occasionally play to their individual strengths by taking charge of different projects. \"It's important that when staff come to us they have access to someone who knows all the job, whichever one they speak to,\" says Ms Gregory. </p> <p>The partners say that the key to making things work is good communication. \"Communication is crucial,\" says Ms Gregory. \"You have to know what one another are doing and what advice each has given on different issues, or you end up duplicating work. We don't have a situation, as can happen in some job shares, where people play us off against each other. That's because our communication system is watertight.\" </p> <p>The two women operate a handover book in which they record a summary of events, use e-mail extensively and talk a lot on the phone. As they live close to each other, once a week one will call in on the other for a quick update chat. \"We also serve as a useful sounding board for each other. We can share ideas and stresses,\" says Ms Gregory. </p> <p> \"It's also vital that you respect, trust and get on with your job share partner. You should get the chance to meet, get to know and establish a rapport with your partner before starting the job. \"Be wary of having a jobshare partner imposed on you,\" Ms Porter says. \"And try to agree with your employer that if your partner leaves, you will be involved in the recruitment of their replacement.\" </p> <p>If the partnership does not work, you risk covering up for the inefficiencies of your partner or doing twice as much work as them in the same amount of time. </p> <p> <strong> Making it work</strong> </p> <p> Be honest and direct with each other from the outset, airing disagreements as soon as they come up. </p> <p>A seamless handover is vital if your shared role is not to disrupt clients and co-workers. So think \"handover\" all the time and have clear communication channels. </p> <p>Minimise the amount of handovers you need, so ideally work clumps of days each rather than splitting hours each day. </p> <p>You need to maintain some kind of face to face relationship. So arrange the occasional meeting or lunch. </p> <p>Think carefully about how you split your stints. You don't, for example, have to divide a standard week or work one week on, one week off. You could work Wednesday through to the following Tuesday and maintain contuinuity over weekends, something valued by employers. </p> <p>When at work, don't phone your partner unless it's vital. You'll be intruding on their non-work time. </p> <p>If you find it hard to share responsibilities, ideas and tasks, think twice about doing a job share. </p> <p><strong>Partners in time</strong></p> <p>Job sharing has been an exciting and enjoyable experience so far for Michele Guerrini and Sharon Kilcoyne, joint senior branch managers of Nationwide Building Society's Ealing branch in west London. </p> <p>Both are mothers of young children and appreciate the fact that sharing allows them to continue their careers, retain promotion prospects and have time for their families. \"It's also good to have someone to bounce ideas off and discuss problems with. It's less stressful,\" Ms Guerrini says. </p> <p>Six years ago Ms Guerrini was working as a part-time financial adviser for the society while Ms Kilcoyne, in customer services, was considering going part-time when a line manager suggested they apply for a branch manager job share. </p> <p>\"The job wasn't advertised as a job share but we applied together and were interviewed together,\" Ms Guerrini says. \"We presented an action plan as to how we'd approach the post and the management agreed. It helped that we both had very good track records.\" </p> <p>Since then they have shared three posts, the last being the only job share at such a senior level. They each work two-and-a-half days a week, with a lunchtime handover on Wednesdays. \"We have very good communication,\" Ms Guerrini says. \" We speak on the phone at the beginning and end of each day and keep a work in progress log. As the years go by, we no longer need chapter and verse on everything. Our staff say they don't know when one is in and the other isn't.\" </p> <p>The partners share benefits on a pro-rata basis, though each has their own company car. Neither one is expected to fill in for the other if they are off sick or on holiday, but they make sure that someone is always in at least half the week. </p> <p>\"Our employer benefits from having two enthusiastic people coming in fresh,\" Ms Guerrini says. \"I see no downsides to job sharing from either the employee's or employer's point of view. It's down to the sharers to show it can work once they have been given the opportunity.\"</p> <p>\u0095 New Ways to Work helpline 0207-930-3355. e-mail nww@dircon.co.uk</p>",

The findings show that two out of three women do take a career break and the decision blights their career.

      "bodyText": "Career guidance experts Working Future have set up an electronic shop for anyone beginning a new career or kick-starting a stalled one. The website offers links across the employment spectrum including tips on job search, managing a career change, financial advice and CVs. There is an online database with more than 80,000 opportunities. Downloading costs start at \u00a325 a throw: www.workingfutures.com The challenges faced by professional women restarting careers after a break to raise a family or nurse an elderly relative may not be aired as often as the difficulties faced by their unskilled sisters. Yet the loss of employees in whom organisations have significant investment represents a waste of talent. To address this issue, Women Returners' Network (WRN) carried out a study into the role of professional associations in easing the return to work of professional women. The findings show that two out of three women do take a career break and the decision blights their career. Turning to professional associations for help is less than satisfactory, as most do not have measures in place to support their female members. For copies of the report contact Val Hammond on 01293-851644. Take a look at the minutes of any board meeting and you will find that \"training\" often features under \"any other business\", so before closing the meeting, the purse-keepers can say \"sorry, there's no money for that\". Now, with the development of cost-effective online study packages, training can be delivered to a desktop through CD-Rom or in-house networks. And no one has done more to push the cause of interactive online learning than Xebec McGraw-Hill. It is the UK-based Lifelong Learning Division of the US media giant McGraw-Hill, which has been publishing educational texts for 100 years. Organisations like House of Fraser, London Borough of Newham and the Department for Education and Employment have installed Xebec Online's business and manage- ment skills learning program. Its management and communications skills library is aimed at front-line staff and managers at all levels. And the course material on its executive development package is designed for senior managers on fast-track career paths. For details tel: 0800-585-889 or www.xebec-online.com",

He dealt with it astutely, promoted David O'Leary, and has reaped huge rewards. </p> <p>Ridsdale, who is married with two young children, established his business acumen in retail management with the Burton Group and, more specifically, with the Top Man brand. </p> <p>When Caspian bought the club from the former chairman Bill Fotherby and two other directors, it immediately installed Ridsdale in a challenging dual role. </p> <p>He is also a rising star among Premiership chairmen and is definitely in the \"one to watch\" category in football's hierarchy. </p> <p>Arsenal's David Dein narrowly beat him to the vice-chairmanship of the Football Association recently.

It is not often a man in his position has time to sit back and enjoy the fruits of his labour. Just take the past few weeks. His club were punished with a record fine by the Football Association for that on-the-pitch scuffle with Tottenham players; some of his brightest young assets are facing assault charges; and now two of his club's supporters are lying in a mortuary in Turkey. And still he has to put on a corporate face, one that satisfies shareholders, investors, sponsors, supporters and the press. Within a few months of his elevation from a director of the football club to running both businesses, Ridsdale was confronted by George Graham's defection to Tottenham. He dealt with it astutely, promoted David O'Leary, and has reaped huge rewards. Ridsdale, who is married with two young children, established his business acumen in retail management with the Burton Group and, more specifically, with the Top Man brand. When Caspian bought the club from the former chairman Bill Fotherby and two other directors, it immediately installed Ridsdale in a challenging dual role. He is also a rising star among Premiership chairmen and is definitely in the \"one to watch\" category in football's hierarchy. Arsenal's David Dein narrowly beat him to the vice-chairmanship of the Football Association recently. The newish kid on the block will not have to camp outside the offices of the Premier League or the FA when new opportunities arise.",

      "body": "<p>Hello Hell, We Are Leeds, read one banner carried by fans piling through Istanbul airport on Wednesday night. In fact, the Leeds United supporters, arriving for the first leg of their Uefa Cup semi-final with Galatasaray, were at first greeted in a way which mostly belied the Welcome to Hell banners which have traditionally greeted English teams there. </p> <p>For players and supporters alike, this has become one of the most fraught and difficult venues in Europe. Fatih Terim, Galatasaray's coach, had whipped up his side's supporters. \"Their chanting should make Ali Sami Yen [the Galatasaray stadium] hell for Leeds United.\" </p> <p>The manager of Leeds, David O'Leary, had voiced fears of being met at the airport by \"a 100-strong rentamob\". But he was not and the atmosphere was initially warmer than normal. </p> <p>But from 10.30pm local time, any sense of complacency seemed tragically misplaced, as a brutal battle began between Leeds supporters and a group of Turks, with running fights in the streets. A few hours later two Leeds supporters, Kevin Speight, 40, and Christopher Loftus, 37, were dead from stab wounds. Mr Loftus from a plunging wound to his heart; Mr Speight, a few hours later after receiving a wound the length of his stomach. At least nine other people, including six Leeds fans, were injured. </p> <p>Though the versions of Leeds fans and Turkish witnesses are almost entirely at odds, it appears the trouble started in the city's entertainment district outside the Riddim reggae bar in Buyuk Parmakkapi Street. From 5pm local time more than 100 Leeds fans had arrived shouting, singing and demanding beer, according to Batu Dedeler, the bar owner. </p> <p>\"They were screaming all sorts of things. They ordered us to pump up the volume, so we did,\" said Mr Dedeler, 24. \"We did amazing business in one hour. They knocked back as much Elfe (lager), Jack Daniels and Bacardi as I could pour.\" </p> <p>\"Most were kind, but there were five or six really crazy guys. They carried beer glasses outside, we couldn't stop them, and others followed.\" Outside, Leeds fans reportedly taunted Turkish men. </p> <p>More than a dozen police watched but initially did not intervene. According to one witness, a Turkish man was pushed to the ground and smashed his teeth on the pavement. The police claim he was punched. </p> <p>Scuffles broke out but the police moved in and fans scattered. Some headed for the James Joyce pub 200 metres away and joined a sing-song against Galatasaray.

      "bodyText": "Hello Hell, We Are Leeds, read one banner carried by fans piling through Istanbul airport on Wednesday night. In fact, the Leeds United supporters, arriving for the first leg of their Uefa Cup semi-final with Galatasaray, were at first greeted in a way which mostly belied the Welcome to Hell banners which have traditionally greeted English teams there. For players and supporters alike, this has become one of the most fraught and difficult venues in Europe. Fatih Terim, Galatasaray's coach, had whipped up his side's supporters. \"Their chanting should make Ali Sami Yen [the Galatasaray stadium] hell for Leeds United.\" The manager of Leeds, David O'Leary, had voiced fears of being met at the airport by \"a 100-strong rentamob\". But he was not and the atmosphere was initially warmer than normal. But from 10.30pm local time, any sense of complacency seemed tragically misplaced, as a brutal battle began between Leeds supporters and a group of Turks, with running fights in the streets. A few hours later two Leeds supporters, Kevin Speight, 40, and Christopher Loftus, 37, were dead from stab wounds. Mr Loftus from a plunging wound to his heart; Mr Speight, a few hours later after receiving a wound the length of his stomach. At least nine other people, including six Leeds fans, were injured. Though the versions of Leeds fans and Turkish witnesses are almost entirely at odds, it appears the trouble started in the city's entertainment district outside the Riddim reggae bar in Buyuk Parmakkapi Street. From 5pm local time more than 100 Leeds fans had arrived shouting, singing and demanding beer, according to Batu Dedeler, the bar owner. \"They were screaming all sorts of things. They ordered us to pump up the volume, so we did,\" said Mr Dedeler, 24. \"We did amazing business in one hour. They knocked back as much Elfe (lager), Jack Daniels and Bacardi as I could pour.\" \"Most were kind, but there were five or six really crazy guys. They carried beer glasses outside, we couldn't stop them, and others followed.\" Outside, Leeds fans reportedly taunted Turkish men. More than a dozen police watched but initially did not intervene. According to one witness, a Turkish man was pushed to the ground and smashed his teeth on the pavement. The police claim he was punched. Scuffles broke out but the police moved in and fans scattered. Some headed for the James Joyce pub 200 metres away and joined a sing-song against Galatasaray. Staff said many fans were drunk by 10pm, intimidating Turkish families drinking in the lounge. \"They were using very bad language,\" said Abdul Garlad, a manager. \"Maybe they thought they were being funny but to Turks who do not speak good English, it was very offensive.\" By 10.30pm some of the rowdiest fans left the James Joyce and joined a crowd outside McDonalds just off Taksim Square.

But as the Depression hit America, the jobless, the homeless, the exploited and degraded began to forge a mighty weapon to assert their right to justice and just reward, and theatre was that weapon. For a few short years, America was ablaze with such theatrical-inspired leftwing passion that the government had to call out their judicial marines to douse the fires - senator Martin Dies's House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). This was a dozen years before the infamous McCarthy era. </p> <p>Tim Robbins's new film, Cradle Will Rock, is a recreation of one of the legendary moments of this period, when leftwing theatre took a spectacular stand against the growing censorship which was eventually to stifle the entire movement. </p> <p>There had been radical theatre in the 20s, but this reflected no more than bohemianism and had no notion of propagating political doctrines. As theatre historian Joseph Krutch of Columbia University wrote in his \"informal history\", The American Drama in 1957: \"If theatre looked with a jaundiced eye upon the rich it was more often to expose their vulgarity.\" </p> <p>The Depression (which ran from 1929 virtually to the outbreak of the second world war) changed all that. By the mid-30s Uncle Sam was besieged by a startling proliferation of leftwing theatre, an activity which, for a time, was ironically totally government subsidised. </p> <p>In July 1935, President Roosevelt added the Federal Theatre Project to his New Deal work relief agencies. Hallie Flanagan was appointed national director. Flanagan had produced plays at Harvard and Vassar, but had no experience of the commercial theatre. Her boss, Harry Hopkins, head of the national Works Progress Administration regarded this as a virtue. The intention was not profit, but to get theatre people back to work in the same way as bricklayers and plumbers. But Flanagan had been to Europe to study on a Guggenheim grant (a background later to be the target of the HUAC) and learned about modern theatre. She was given a $46m budget. Seats at the theatres would range from 10 cents to $1. Producers were paid about $200 a month; actors about $55. </p> <p>The left was in ferment following the rise of Hitler and Mussolini and in 1935 they were presented with the most romantic liberal cause of the century - the Spanish civil war. The Communist party in America had craftily toned down its dogmatism to accommodate hitherto despised socialists and liberals in the Popular Front against fascism. All across America the workers - mostly strikers and the unemployed - began to preach revolt. </p> <p>Flanagan had no objections. Thrashing around in there with the activists, salvationists and trades unionists were names which were to become legends in Hollywood: Orson Welles, John Houseman, Elia Kazan, Lee J Cobb - even Duke Ellington made a guest appearance. Hemingway briefly became an idol of the Communist party when he created the narrative for Joris Ivens's film, The Spanish Earth. </p> <p>The first great agitprop play was Waiting for Lefty, written by 28-year-old Clifford Odets, then a member of the Communist party. It was set during the taxi-drivers' strike of 1934 and is essentially a series of turns in which taxi men deliver their stories of poverty, oppression and injustice and clamour for a world \"free of fear and falsehood and craven servitude to stupidity and greed\". As they wait for Lefty (a Godot of the 30s who never turns up) a taxi man called Agate - his name a play on the word \"agitiate\" - delivers a passionate speech: \"These slick slobs stand here telling us about bogeymen. But the man who gave food to me in 1932, he called me comrade! The one who picked me up where I bled - he called me comrade too!\" When the word comes that Lefty has been murdered it is Agate who gives \"the birth cry of the 30s\": \"STRIKE!\" \"Louder,\" shouts Agate.\" \"STRIKE! STRIKE! STRIKE!\" </p> <p>Perfidious Destiny must have been sniggering up her sleeve, as Agate was played by Elia Kazan, the future director of On the Waterfront and later reviled as the man who betrayed his Hollywood comrades to McCarthy. Waiting for Lefty was a triumph - a measure of the huge surge of emotion that had seized America whose industrialists - steel in particular - were, literally, making a killing, selling materials to Hitler and Mussolini while grinding the workers underfoot (a popular phrase at the time). Sensationally, Lefty invaded the commercial theatre, moving to Broadway for 78 performances. At one point, Odets wrote, it was playing simultaneously in 62 American cities. </p> <p>Odets helped seduce the middle class to agitprop theatre. Some of the real-life taxi drivers were professional men reduced to hackney work to earn a living. One of Odets's characters is a former lab assistant who is fired for having refused to work on poison gas; another a physician dismissed for covert anti-semitic reasons. </p> <p>A few weeks before Lefty emerged in 1934, Orson Welles had produced Panic, by Archibald MacLeish, a verse tragedy with chorale and chant, the chorus directed by Martha Graham. It went down a treat. </p> <p>Here was the theatre flourishing in a climate of such eager, generous open-mindedness that there was room for neither aesthetic fastidiousness nor inverted snobbery. The theatre had something to say and it would say it in any form it needed. Odets put it succinctly: \"We are living in a time when new artworks should shoot bullets.\" </p> <p>One strand of the Federal Theatre Project was called the Federal Living Newspaper. The \"newspaper\" offered subjects such as Dirt, Liberty Deferred, Power and Poor Little Consumer, and - its most successful production - One Third of a Nation, which sensationally closes with a simulated fire in a tenement building. </p> <p> Another knock-out success was the International Ladies' Garment Workers' racially integrated production of Pins and Needles. It ran for 1,108 performances, a landmark for a musical comedy exceeded only by Olsen and Johnson's Hellzapoppin'. Its cast were cutters, dressmakers, and knit goods workers from the ILGWU's locals. Its hit songs included the satirical It's Not Cricket to Picket, and Four Little Angels of Peace. (These latter were Hitler, Mussolini, an unnamed Japanese and, rather surprisingly, Britain's imperialist-inclined foreign secretary, Anthony Eden.) </p> <p>Welles had already had a triumph with his Julius Caesar, in a blood-red setting. Along with Houseman, his policy at their Mercury Theatre was to produce classical plays \"which have factual or emotional bearing on contemporary life\". But the great leftwing theatre movement was now about to reach its apotheosis - and its demise. </p> <p>In June 1937, a serious composer working in blues and swing, Marc Blitzstein, wrote what was essentially a musical cartoon called The Cradle Will Rock. Set in Steeltown, it featured a nasty steel mill owner and his family: Mr Mister, Mrs Mister, Brother Mister and Sister Mister. In those days, when you could be fired for not addressing your boss as \"Mister\", the characters' names alone were worth a gleeful chortle. </p> <p>The theme is union organisation; the hero, Larry Foreman, plants onions (unions). During a police round-up of striking steel workers the Mister family are mistakenly thrown into jail. In the course of that night Mr Mister's corrupt control of education, the press and even the church is exposed in a series of satirical numbers. </p> <p>Joseph Krutch wrote: \"The very ferocity of the satire is remarkable, some of the lyrics are raffishly amusing and there is a savage, cumulative absurdity hard to describe.\" It ends with news that the workers of Steeltown are on the march. Our hero sings: \" That's a storm that's going to last until/The final wind blows... and when the wind blows.../The cradle will rock. \" This was an open threat of revolution. </p> <p>The Federal Theatre fumbled the opportunity to put on the play and Welles and Houseman took over. But by now Flanagan herself was in the dock, deftly fielding questions from the Dies committee regarding her cultural formation, notably her admiration for a person named Christopher Marlowe. Representative Joe Starnes of Alabama demanded: \"Is he a communist? Tell us who this Marlowe is so we can get the proper reference.\" Flanagan replied with a straight face: \"Put in the record that he was the greatest dramatist in the period immediately preceding Shakespeare.\" </p> <p>But scoring cultural points was about all Flanagan could do at this point. The American right was wresting back power from Roosevelt and won a cut of 30% in the budget of the Federal Theatre's New York projects. There was an immediate ban on staging any new plays before July 1, 1937. This was rightly interpreted as creeping censorship. The Cradle Will Rock was scheduled to open on June 16 and 14,000 advance bookings had already been sold. Flanagan pleaded in vain for a dispensation. </p> <p>Now Welles came up against another barrier. Equity demanded that the actors had to receive permission from their employers, the Federal Theatre, to act for the Welles-Houseman company. This was not forthcoming. Blitzstein was not a union member, and Welles or Houseman had the brilliant idea of having him perform the whole thing sitting on stage, at his piano, just as he had done in the original workouts. </p> <p>Now began feverish attempts by Welles and Houseman to find a venue. Welles assured the press and ardent public that the work would be performed and announced a rendezvous outside the closed theatre, although the National Guard barred the entrance. Howard da Silva (whose career was later destroyed by McCarthy) entertained the audience on the sidewalk while the search went on. At the last moment a theatre was found, the Venice, and the 22-year-old Welles led his followers 20 blocks to the new venue. </p> <p>When Blitzstein began to perform many of the cast, in defiance of their union, rose one by one from their seats in the theatre and performed from there. It was a stupendous hit and from then on this was how the play was put on across America. </p> <p>A year later the Federal Theatre project was shut down. \"Because it put the fruit of its labour - the productions - before a mass audience, it brought down on itself the implacable hostility of conservative legislators of both parties,\" wrote Malcolm Goldstein in his 1974 book The Political Stage: American Drama and Theatre of the Great Depression. </p> <p>The same year Welles went on to amuse himself, throwing America into a panic with his War of the Worlds radio broadcast - too realistically \"reporting\" an invasion from Mars. The reality to come was worse: Pearl Harbor. And the leftwing movement of America become submerged in bellicose patriotism.</p>",

But the <a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/sport/story/0,3604,156825,00.html\">deaths</a>, on Thursday, of four horses at Aintree - one on the National course itself - have cast a shadow over the event and raised fresh questions about the potential risks for horses taking part in Saturday's race. The <a href=\"http://www.aintree.co.uk/raintree.htm\">course</a> is a brutal one. Nearly two and a quarter miles long, it has 16 fences. The horses have to complete almost two circuits followed by a 494-yard finish, which has proved the downfall of many in the past. </p> <p>3. Among the most dangerous features of the course are the famous drop fences, where the landing side is lower than the take-off side. The horse is unaware of the drop until it is hurtling through the air. Eudip, a top-rated horse, died at the most famous of these, Bechers Brook, last year. That is why groups such as <a href=\"http://www.animalaid.org.uk/\">Animal Aid</a> dislike the event. </p> <p>4. The first official races at Aintree were organised by the owner of <a href=\"http://www.liverpool.com/TARGET=\" _new\">Liverpool</a>'s Waterloo Hotel, William Lynn, who laid out a course, built a grandstand and staged the first flat fixture in 1829.</p> <p>5. In 1839, Lottery - carrying 12 stone - became the winner of the first true Grand National, although it was hardly grand in those days. The horses had only to jump a stone wall (now the water jump), cross a stretch of plough land and finish over two hurdles. Since its inception, the event has become famous throughout the world, inspiring, among other things, a number of <a href=\"http://www.cix.co.uk/~convivium/files/grandnat.htm\">games</a>.</p> <p> 6. The 1913 race was particularly memorable for tragic reasons. Emily Wilding Davison, <a href=\"http://www.informinc.co.uk/LM/LM104/LM104_Alt.html#5\">a suffragette</a>, rushed on to the course at Tattenham Corner, bringing down the King's horse and killing herself in the process - an event captured on black-and-white newsreel.</p> <p>7. In 1949, Lord Sefton sold the course to the Topham family, who appointed <a href=\"http://www.musicweb.force9.co.uk/music/bantock/buddint.htm#Gaiety _new\">former Gaiety girl</a> Mirabel Topham to manage it. The redoubtable Mrs Topham built a new track within the established course and opened it in 1953, the same year as the motor circuit which still encircles the track.</p> <p>8. The motor circuit, another of Mrs Topham's bright ideas, quickly gained a reputation as one of the best in the world, hosting a European Grand Prix and five British Grands Prix. <a href=\"http://www.stirlingmoss.com/\">Stirling Moss</a> won his first <a href=\"http://www.ddavid.com/formula1/>Grand Prix</a> there in 1955, while <a href=\" http: www2.eis.net.au ~bramwell jim.htm\">Jim Clark</a> won in 1962.</p> <p>9. Aintree suffered some lean times in the post-war years and in 1965 it was announced that the course would be sold to a property developer. Thus began a prolonged period of speculation, which, every year, brought solemn warnings of \"the last Grand National\". It is now sponsored by Martell, part of the <a href=\"http://www.seagram.com/\">Seagram</a> drinks and entertainment empire.</p> <p>10. Past winners include L'Escargot and Red Rum. This year, Paul Carberry has been cleared to ride last year's winner, <a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/sport/story/0,3604,155749,00.html\">Bobbyjo</a>, which is bidding to become the first horse to achieve back-to-back successes since Red Rum in 1974.</p>",

The redoubtable Mrs Topham built a new track within the established course and opened it in 1953, the same year as the motor circuit which still encircles the track. 8. The motor circuit, another of Mrs Topham's bright ideas, quickly gained a reputation as one of the best in the world, hosting a European Grand Prix and five British Grands Prix. Stirling Moss won his first Jim Clark won in 1962. 9. Aintree suffered some lean times in the post-war years and in 1965 it was announced that the course would be sold to a property developer. Thus began a prolonged period of speculation, which, every year, brought solemn warnings of \"the last Grand National\". It is now sponsored by Martell, part of the Seagram drinks and entertainment empire. 10. Past winners include L'Escargot and Red Rum. This year, Paul Carberry has been cleared to ride last year's winner, Bobbyjo, which is bidding to become the first horse to achieve back-to-back successes since Red Rum in 1974.",

If, within 10 minutes, the child has wandered off to play with its toy cars, you can look forward to grandchildren in about 20 years. If, however, it appears riveted to the screen and performs little dramatic hand gestures - congratulations! You have a homosexual. </p> <p>Gay people have a special affinity with musical theatre and its louder cinematic incarnation. Scratch even the most hardline post-queer dogmatist and you'll find a chorus girl struggling to kick out. It's a cliche, of course, but like most cliches it's rooted in fact: let us not forget that back in the days of Ivor Novello, \"musical\" was a euphemism for homosexual. (\"Do you think s/he's musical?\" \"Oh yes, ever so.\") </p> <p>In recognition of this happy fact, the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival is staging an evening of communal jollity entitled Cine-oke, a sequel to last year's pioneering Sing-Along-A Sound of Music (a phenomenon which, snapped up by some canny West End producers, now has them Edelweissing in the aisles from Land's End to John O'Groats). Brave souls choose in advance their favourite numbers from screen musicals; the NFT's subtitlers get to work, and, on Sunday evening, the whole concept comes together in what the organisers are hoping will be \"a raucous cross between a church service and a drag act\". </p> <p>Last year's event was, according to NFT programmer Bryony Hansen, \"Extremely emotional. Even the projectionist was crying. I've never known anything that's simultaneously so funny and so moving.\" </p> <p>But why? Nobody's kidding themselves that these particular films or songs are in themselves superbly moving works of art. We're talking about Funny Girl, not La Boh\u00e8me. Musicals are by definition absurd, a strange hybrid form where Salvation Army girls burst into song and dozens of sailors do fancy dances. Gay people in general have a finely tuned sense of the ridiculous, which explains the laughter - but whence the tears? </p> <p>\"Musicals generally present a version of life that is not only camp but also out of the ordinary,\" says comedian and Cine-oke host Jackie Clune. \"For most gay people growing up, life seems pretty extraordinary, and that's what musicals tap into. And it's a very celebratory form, which also appeals. I'm not saying, 'Gosh, all gay people are huge fun!', that's too simplistic, but we do have a real flair for celebration.\" </p> <p>For David Blackburn, a 30-year-old administration manager at a Staines software company, the appeal of musicals is even more direct. \"As a teenager I was fat, I had terrible acne, I thought I looked like Quasimodo and I dimly realised that I was gay. That's not a great combination to grow up with. The only thing that I could do well was sing. I fell in love with musicals because they seemed to be the only thing that offered me a chance of being happy.\" </p> <p>On Sunday evening, Blackburn will be giving the world his interpretation of Don't Rain on My Parade from the 1968 film of Funny Girl, starring Barbra Streisand. </p> <p>\"A few friends suggested that I should drag up,\" he says, \"but that's not the point. It's about me as a man singing along with Barbra. Besides which I'd have to shave off my beard if I was going to do it properly. I shall probably have a few judicious hand props, like the big bunch of yellow roses she brandishes. And I've got the hand gestures off by heart: she screams at the beginning of the song, then it's hands down, hands up to the face. I shall probably have to do a little circuit of the stage in the middle of the song, as Babs indeed does.\" </p> <p>Clearly this is a scene that Blackburn has watched more than once. \"I saw Funny Girl on BBC2 one Saturday afternoon when I was eight or nine, and I've been a complete musical-theatre diva ever since. Of course, at that age I didn't know who Babs was; I just knew the music was fantastic. The music always comes first. I'm also a huge Judy [Garland] fan, and I'm forever explaining to my friends that it's not just because she's a gay icon. I love her voice, that raw quality. But my house isn't a tragic shrine to Babs and Judy. I don't have a single picture of either of them on the wall, although I do own a lot of soundtrack recordings.\" </p> <p>Pressed a little further, Blackburn admits that there's more to musicals than music. \"There's a great quote from Elizabeth Taylor: 'The trouble with life is bad lighting, no score.' I often wish that on a cold, grey afternoon I could burst into song and the whole cafe would join in with me and know the choreography. It's partly to do with escapism, but also because all the great musicals have an element of defiance in them. When you've got Babs up there singing, 'Don't tell me not to fly, I've simply got to . . . ,' then obviously that's going to have massive resonances for gay people. It all boils down to 'I am what I am'. You have to remember that a lot of these shows were created by gay people at a time when it wasn't easy to express your sexuality directly, and so there's a huge repressed energy to do with love and identity that's just bursting out of these songs. Plus, when you're writing for someone like Ethel Merman, you're upping the camp quotient by about a million.\" </p> <p>This is not to suggest that musicals are strictly a gay art form. The Sing-Along-A Sound of Music shows, now touring the country, appeal to old ladies, mothers with children, drag queens and businessmen alike. </p> <p>\"Last week I hosted a show in Wolverhampton where a huge group of middle managers all turned up dressed as Nazis,\" says a worried Jackie Clune. \"For them I think it's not so much the emotional or camp appeal of the musical, it's the event itself. It's the dressing up. For a lot of middle England, this is the most daring thing they've ever done in their lives, and it's really fantastic for them. </p> <p>\"When I go on local radio stations to promote the tour, I get nervous presenters asking me, 'This isn't just a gay thing, is it? I mean, we don't want our listeners to be surrounded by hundreds of screaming faggots.' But it's really not. It's grannies sitting next to drag queens. It's the new Britain - at least for those three hours.\" </p> <p>Returning to its festival roots, however, the singalong phenomenon will rediscover its primary audience. \"When we came up with the Sound of Music thing, we didn't realise what we'd stumbled across,\" says Bryony Hansen. \"Other people took the idea and made a lot of money out of it. This year, obviously, there was a lot of pressure on us to repeat the trick. We considered Cabaret, but that was a bit too close to The Sound of Music with the Nazi content. And really, there's no other film that has such universal appeal, where everyone knows the songs and has an emotional connection with the story. So we've broadened the scope, and we're hoping for great things. I'm expecting to be amazed by the passion that people bring to the event, because these songs, these moments from films, mean a great deal.\" </p> <p>Jackie Clune, meanwhile, is considering her own Cine-oke choice. \"I haven't quite decided,\" she says, \"but I'm tending towards Sandy, the big John Travolta number from Grease. I just want to hear the whole of the NFT bellowing 'Oh Sandy, bay-ay-bee, can't you see? . . .'\" </p> <p>\u0095 Cine-oke is at the National Film Theatre, South Bank, London SE1 (0171-928 3232) this Sunday from 6pm.</p>",

Don't). And it was the dawn of MTV, which back then had a playlist of about 15 videos, most of them apparently by A Flock of Seagulls, the Bush of their time.</p> <p> And at the movies we had the Brat Pack, which for the sake of convenience we shall limit to the combined casts of The Breakfast Club and St Elmo's Fire, a double bill I know Satan is saving especially for the day I arrive in Hell - he's got my Clockwork Orange eyeclips all ready. It's a bizarre-looking list: Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy, Demi Moore, and Rob Lowe. If you examine their respective destinies in the years since, it's like reading a dozen riches-to-rags Preston Sturges scripts one after another, chilling evidence of the transience of success and cheap renown. I was privileged to hear both Ally Sheedy and Molly Ringwald reading their moronic confessional poetry aloud in snooty LA bookstores in 1985. Since then, nothing from either, until Sheedy did High Art. Estevez has long since been outshone, out-drunk, out-drugged and out-hookered by his indefatigable brother Charlie \"Call Me Charles\" Sheen. They'll soon be seen together - for the first time since, uh, Men at Work - as feuding 70s sex-club kingpins Jim and Artie Mitchell for Showtime (zero dollars on that gig). Charlie will don a baldie-wig. Emilio will shoot him. </p> <p> Demi Moore subsequently rose to the highest point in the Hollywood landscape and is currently plummeting all the way back down again. Judd Nelson, who now plays Brooke Shields' boss on Suddenly Susan, later hooked up with 90210's champion tantrum-flinger Shannen Doherty, who once screamed at their neighbour, \"You don't live here, bitch! You only rent!\" The neighbour was Molly Ringwald.</p> <p> And finally, Rob Lowe - whom I must thank for all the hours of amusement I and millions of others have enjoyed at his expense. I have a copy of The Tape, the cheesy sex-vid that cost Rob his career when it was circulated at the 1984 Democratic Convention. Whenever I throw a party, that tape is playing on one of the TVs in the house. I always make sure I turn the sound up to 11 when Rob's incredibly wasted mate exhorts the incredibly wasted Rob to \"Fuck her, Rob! Fuck her real good, man!\"; even though it's horribly apparent that Rob can't muster enough wood for the task in hand. The dub copies I end up making for enthusiastic guests are just part of my ongoing revenge for Oxford Blues.</p> <p> The Pack were interviewed en masse by Premiere in 1985, about a year before their collective consignment to the shithouse of oblivion. I remember nothing of what they said - why would I? - but I do recall they all owned the same kind of Jeep and they all had only one album: Bruce Springsteen's Born in the USA, the emetic, terrifyingly ubiquitous soundtrack to the era.</p> <p>Which brings us not very neatly to High Fidelity, which at number five, wasn't the week's biggest new release - that honour goes to the numbskull thriller at number three, The Skulls - though it was certainly the best. Springsteen appears briefly in the movie as himself, in a Play It Again Sam cameo, dispensing advice to a lovelorn John Cusack, the one young actor I liked in 1985 - for The Sure Thing - and still like today.</p> <p> There was all sorts of proprietary whingeing about Nick Hornby's novel being relocated to Chicago, but the book's appeal is sufficiently universal to survive the transition. Who knows, if it had been made in England we might have had another Fever Pitch on our hands or, God help us, another Metroland. As it is, the presence of director Stephen Frears ensures that the spirit of the novel arrives onscreen intact.</p> <p> Cusack is carving out a niche for himself with what I hope will be a long series of mid-budget movies like this and the hitman comedy Grosse Pointe Blank. As an actor in, say, Pushing Tin or Con Air, Cusack always looks a bit lost, but on his chosen ground, he's comfortable and energetic, all charisma and perfect timing. Plus he always clears a space for his sister Joan, the funniest actress on the planet (she's the nearest thing we have to Eve Arden). </p> <p>In High Fidelity he's supported by, among others, Lisa Bonet, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lily Taylor, Sara Gilbert and his friend Tim Robbins. The real discovery is Jack Black, playing one of \"the musical moron twins\" who work in Rob's record store. He's the quintessential rock'n'roll Stalinist, issuing diktats on what albums it's OK to like and which are the veriest shite, always saying things like, \"Belle and Sebastian suck ass!\" and \"Well, if you must know, my band's influences are mainly German.\" (\"Like what?\" Cusack retorts. \"Krautrock? Falco? Hasselhoff?\"). Jack Black, I predict, will be back.</p> <p>Which leaves us waiting for the film of Bridget Jones's Diary, High Fidelity's female doppelganger, which may not fare as well with drippy Renee Zellweger as Hornby has with Cusack. I predict another London tourist movie in the Notting Hill mould from what's fast becoming the Helen Fielding-Richard Curtis Britcomedy cartel. I bet that it too will \"suck ass\". Any takers?</p>",

Springsteen appears briefly in the movie as himself, in a Play It Again Sam cameo, dispensing advice to a lovelorn John Cusack, the one young actor I liked in 1985 - for The Sure Thing - and still like today. There was all sorts of proprietary whingeing about Nick Hornby's novel being relocated to Chicago, but the book's appeal is sufficiently universal to survive the transition. Who knows, if it had been made in England we might have had another Fever Pitch on our hands or, God help us, another Metroland. As it is, the presence of director Stephen Frears ensures that the spirit of the novel arrives onscreen intact. Cusack is carving out a niche for himself with what I hope will be a long series of mid-budget movies like this and the hitman comedy Grosse Pointe Blank. As an actor in, say, Pushing Tin or Con Air, Cusack always looks a bit lost, but on his chosen ground, he's comfortable and energetic, all charisma and perfect timing. Plus he always clears a space for his sister Joan, the funniest actress on the planet (she's the nearest thing we have to Eve Arden). In High Fidelity he's supported by, among others, Lisa Bonet, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lily Taylor, Sara Gilbert and his friend Tim Robbins. The real discovery is Jack Black, playing one of \"the musical moron twins\" who work in Rob's record store. He's the quintessential rock'n'roll Stalinist, issuing diktats on what albums it's OK to like and which are the veriest shite, always saying things like, \"Belle and Sebastian suck ass!\" and \"Well, if you must know, my band's influences are mainly German.\" (\"Like what?\" Cusack retorts. \"Krautrock? Falco? Hasselhoff?\"). Jack Black, I predict, will be back. Which leaves us waiting for the film of Bridget Jones's Diary, High Fidelity's female doppelganger, which may not fare as well with drippy Renee Zellweger as Hornby has with Cusack. I predict another London tourist movie in the Notting Hill mould from what's fast becoming the Helen Fielding-Richard Curtis Britcomedy cartel. I bet that it too will \"suck ass\". Any takers?",

Every newspaper in the land now has a style section, and many department stores have in-store style magazines. But although the concept of \u201cstyle\u201d is ubiquitous nowadays, who exactly is it available to? Disabled people have been conspicuously missing from this upsurge of interest in all things fashion-related. None of the numerous television programmes, labels and magazines seem to have paid much attention to the aesthetically conscious disabled person. It\u2019s as if such a group doesn\u2019t exist. </p> <p>Disabled people all have their own ghastly fashion anecdotes. For myself, as a person of restricted growth, it was poorly altered trousers that made me appear to be single-handedly launching a campaign to bring back loon pants. Yet all of us would like to dress better than we do. We do have flair and \u00e9lan - it just has not been recognised. </p> <p>Happily, things are now changing. It is belatedly being acknowledged that disabled people can make a vital contribution to the fashion scene. One major sign that the narrow scope of the fashion industry is becoming widened is that Artsline, London\u2019s arts and entertainment information service for disabled people, is holding a disability-aware fashion show next week. Called In Our Fashion, it will set out to examine the disabled person\u2019s contribution to fashion, and in doing so will hopefully encourage more disabled people to get involved in the industry. </p> <p>\u201cIn Our Fashion, like the core of Artsline\u2019s work, is concerned with awareness, attitude and education,\u201d says the show\u2019s producer, Barrie Addenbrooke. \u201cIt gives a platform for disabled people to show their individuality through personal style in an integrated arena.\u201d The list of participants includes well-known designers such as Red or Dead and Helen David English Eccentrics, high street giants Marks and Spencer, avant garde designer Bourhan Basma, young designer Samantha Noble, who is a deaf person, and specialist disabled persons\u2019 clothing company, Wearable Clothing. The show will be hosted by the disabled actor/musician <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/mat-fraser\">Mat Fraser</a>, who is currently presenting the Channel 4 series Freak Out and is appearing in a new series, Metrosexuality. The models will be both disabled and able-bodied. The intention is to show the involvement of disabled people at every stage of the process of creating fashion. </p> <p>Red or Dead\u2019s Wayne Hemingway, one of the key participants in the show, says: \u201cFashion needs a kick up the arse. The fashion industry needs to be more accepting and adopt a more ethical stance on who it dresses and how. Fashion has always been an extension of personality, and fashion styles need to be created which reflect the richness of disabled people\u2019s lives.\u201d Instead of constantly rehashing the same over-simplified concept of beauty, Hemingway says, there should be a greater emphasis on the particular beauty of every individual person. </p> <p>But how can this be realistically achieved? Hemingway concedes that the economics of the fashion industry will not allow all sizes and shapes to be catered for. He sees the industry as too reliant on long production runs for people of uniform shape. He believes, however, that a more responsive alteration service should be provided at fashion outlets by trained staff free of charge. </p> <p>This is certainly a move that would be welcomed by disabled people. For my part, I have to go to the teenage section in any department store, where I make do with scaled-down versions of adult clothes.

      "bodyText": "The word \u201cstyle\u201d is everywhere. It seems to be applied to every nuance of life these days. Every newspaper in the land now has a style section, and many department stores have in-store style magazines. But although the concept of \u201cstyle\u201d is ubiquitous nowadays, who exactly is it available to? Disabled people have been conspicuously missing from this upsurge of interest in all things fashion-related. None of the numerous television programmes, labels and magazines seem to have paid much attention to the aesthetically conscious disabled person. It\u2019s as if such a group doesn\u2019t exist. Disabled people all have their own ghastly fashion anecdotes. For myself, as a person of restricted growth, it was poorly altered trousers that made me appear to be single-handedly launching a campaign to bring back loon pants. Yet all of us would like to dress better than we do. We do have flair and \u00e9lan - it just has not been recognised. Happily, things are now changing. It is belatedly being acknowledged that disabled people can make a vital contribution to the fashion scene. One major sign that the narrow scope of the fashion industry is becoming widened is that Artsline, London\u2019s arts and entertainment information service for disabled people, is holding a disability-aware fashion show next week. Called In Our Fashion, it will set out to examine the disabled person\u2019s contribution to fashion, and in doing so will hopefully encourage more disabled people to get involved in the industry. \u201cIn Our Fashion, like the core of Artsline\u2019s work, is concerned with awareness, attitude and education,\u201d says the show\u2019s producer, Barrie Addenbrooke. \u201cIt gives a platform for disabled people to show their individuality through personal style in an integrated arena.\u201d The list of participants includes well-known designers such as Red or Dead and Helen David English Eccentrics, high street giants Marks and Spencer, avant garde designer Bourhan Basma, young designer Samantha Noble, who is a deaf person, and specialist disabled persons\u2019 clothing company, Wearable Clothing. The show will be hosted by the disabled actor/musician Mat Fraser, who is currently presenting the Channel 4 series Freak Out and is appearing in a new series, Metrosexuality. The models will be both disabled and able-bodied. The intention is to show the involvement of disabled people at every stage of the process of creating fashion. Red or Dead\u2019s Wayne Hemingway, one of the key participants in the show, says: \u201cFashion needs a kick up the arse. The fashion industry needs to be more accepting and adopt a more ethical stance on who it dresses and how. Fashion has always been an extension of personality, and fashion styles need to be created which reflect the richness of disabled people\u2019s lives.\u201d Instead of constantly rehashing the same over-simplified concept of beauty, Hemingway says, there should be a greater emphasis on the particular beauty of every individual person. But how can this be realistically achieved? Hemingway concedes that the economics of the fashion industry will not allow all sizes and shapes to be catered for. He sees the industry as too reliant on long production runs for people of uniform shape. He believes, however, that a more responsive alteration service should be provided at fashion outlets by trained staff free of charge. This is certainly a move that would be welcomed by disabled people. For my part, I have to go to the teenage section in any department store, where I make do with scaled-down versions of adult clothes. Some teenage sections, of course, stock clothes that look too young for me - John Lewis and Selfridges are among the better ones, with a good mixed range. But services in menswear departments could be more flexible. Selfridges does have personal shopping services available for the disabled customer, and says it is examining how the store can best develop services for its disabled clientele.

      "body": "<p><strong>ALL CHANGE</strong></p> <p>Cast your mind back, if you dare, to the late 1980s. A time when Maggie's Den was No.10, Yazz ruled the airwaves, and a Hoddlesque light perm and a filofax automatically made you the man. In this time of swirling uncertainties, only football seemed to offer a few unalterable truths: Liverpool won everything, Arsenal were boring and Spurs were sexy. Manchester United? They didn't win a sausage.</p> <p>Since then everything has changed. Arsenal have become the old Spurs, Liverpool have become the old Arsenal, and Manchester United have become the old Liverpool. Now that's confusing enough, so we don't need Professor Arsene Wenger trying to morph into Fergie. Last night, the Gunners boss blamed his yellow-shirted side's poor performance against yellow-shorted Lens on colour-blindness. \"The players saw the yellow and passed towards it,\" whined Wenger in his best Glasweigan accent. \"We asked the referee if we could change our colour but he wouldn't let us.\" Strangely enough, the Lens players didn't seem to be as worried.</p> <p>As older readers will recall, Wenger's protests are strikingly similar to Fergie's moaning three years ago when United were thrashed 3-1 at Southampton. Then, the Fergster blamed the defeat on his players not being able to spot each other in their grey shirts. All we need now is for Wenger to buff his nose into a purple-red sheen and start shaking a stopwatch angrily at the referee at the end of each match, and the transformation will be complete. </p> <p><strong>SATURDAY CAN BE SWEET</strong></p> <p>Think of us as an tightwad ambassador trying to force cheap chocolate down your scraggy neck. \"Why Fiver! With Football Unlimited's unrivalled Saturday service - latest scores, match reports by 7pm and the very best in comment from the Observer - you are really spoiling us!\"</p> <p><strong>NEW MUSICAL EXCESS</strong></p> <p>Yo, kick-and-rush the show! Trendy music guru MC Fiver is back, keeping you abreast of the latest news whilst simultaneously keeping it real in your homies and hanging with your hood. The latest word on the pavement concerns the Football Association of Wales, who are planning a pre-match musical carnival before their friendly against Brazil on May 23. According to an FAW spokesman, this is because they want to \"give the crowd a lift and give the whole stadium a party atmosphere\".</p> <p>So have they planned a joyous samba shindig which will create that special Brazilian festive spirit? Not exactly... step forward earnest troubadours Manic Street Preachers, who will kick off the good times with fun single If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next, a song addressing both the Spanish Civil War and the repeated selection of Mark Pembridge.</p> <p>Also lined up to \"keep the Welsh football buzz going\" are the Stereophonics - an inspired choice given that Welsh football is one-paced and without spark or direction. And that's not all - the FAW hope the krazy karnival will also feature pot-head popsters Super Furry Animals, whose single The International Language Of Screaming is likely to be revisited by Welsh manager Mark Hughes after the final whistle. MC Fiver is already queuing for his ticket.</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"When I look at my squad and look at all the other squads - and I saw Italy play Spain last week - I can honestly say that with the players we've got, nobody else has got that strength in depth\" - Kelvin Koogan's analysis of all the Euro 2000 finalists was just about audible above his loudly flipping lid.</p> <p><strong>THE ONLY WAY IS DOWN</strong></p> <p>This week the previews concentrate on the bottom of the Premiership. God we're depressed.</p> <p>Bradford v Southampton<br> Bradford can't afford anything but a win, while Southampton hope and pray for the three points which would see them all but safe. Someone's going to go home feeling really low. Robbie Blake is in line for a recall, so either Jorge Cadete, Dean Saunders or Dean Windass will have their day ruined. Saints fans will be slightly cheered by the return of fat-but-loved Matthew Le Tissier, but any momentary happiness will be ruined by the sad news that Claus Lundekvam is still fit. Where's the Prozac?</p> <p>Sunderland v Wimbledon<br> Sunderland's 37-year-old defender Steve Bould returns from injury to make his 500th league appearance. It's awful when the best times are behind you. Meanwhile, relegation-haunted Wimbledon welcome back Ben Thatcher and Hermann Hreidarsson, but Carl Cort is still out of action. So where are the goals going to come from? Keep the warm water running!</p> <p>Watford v Derby<br> Watford are as good as down, but you never know... a couple of good wins could help. What's that? Suspensions to Mark Williams and Paul Robinson and injuries to Paul Kennedy, Nordin Wooter and Heidar Helgusson have decimated their squad? Aaargh! Derby are unchanged after their pleasing 3-0 trouncing of Leicester, which means Dean Sturridge keeps his place up front alongside Branko Strupar. But they're not out of the woods yet and they're living on their nerves. It's hell living like that, we tell you, hell!</p> <p>Chelsea v Newcastle (Sunday)<br> Not technically a relegation battle, because it's an FA Cup semi-final. But misery still waits in the wings. Frank Leboeuf and Jon Harley replace Emerson Thome and Celestine Babayaro in a Chelsea side on a high. The problem with feeling that good, though, is that you've got further to fall when everything goes wrong. As it inevitably will. Steve Howey, Nikos Dabizas, Kevin Gallacher, Nolberto Solano and Diego Gavilan all return to Bobby Robson's squad, but Newcastle, the FA Cup and inner torment always go hand in hand, don't they? Must these black clouds always follow us around?</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Leeds will bid for Bayern Munich striker Carsten Janker, according to Planet Football. The striker is unlikely to leave his native Germany, however.</p> <p>Fenerbahce are stepping up their chase for Chelsea's Gianfranco Zola.</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>A man has confessed to stabbing one of the two Leeds fans killed in clashes before the Uefa Cup semi-final against Galatasaray in Istanbul on Wednesday. Ali Umit Demir told police \"I stabbed him\" and led them to the knife used in the attack. Police in Istanbul would not say whether Demir was suspected of stabbing Christopher Loftus or Kevin Speight. In all, 13 men are in custody over the trouble including seven being questioned specifically about the killings. Another man is said to be still at large and police are hoping to track him down via one of the other suspects. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Turkish Football Association have written to Leeds United to express their sadness at the deaths of Loftus and Speight. \"It is not in the spirit of sport and we do not want to see anything like this happening again,\" said the letter. The TFA's action comes after the FA branded Galatasaray's failure to hold a minute's silence or wear black armbands during last night's Uefa Cup semi-final as \"inappropriate\".</p> <p>Jean Tigana has confirmed he has been in contact with Fulham over the vacant manager's job. \"If anything's going to happen it will be next week,\" said the former French midfielder and Monaco boss.</p> <p>Southampton goalkeeper Paul Jones will undergo surgery this weekend in a bid to cure a back injury that is threatening to end the Welsh international's career. Jones, 32, will have an operation over the weekend to have a disc removed from his back.

In this time of swirling uncertainties, only football seemed to offer a few unalterable truths: Liverpool won everything, Arsenal were boring and Spurs were sexy. Manchester United? They didn't win a sausage. Since then everything has changed. Arsenal have become the old Spurs, Liverpool have become the old Arsenal, and Manchester United have become the old Liverpool. Now that's confusing enough, so we don't need Professor Arsene Wenger trying to morph into Fergie. Last night, the Gunners boss blamed his yellow-shirted side's poor performance against yellow-shorted Lens on colour-blindness. \"The players saw the yellow and passed towards it,\" whined Wenger in his best Glasweigan accent. \"We asked the referee if we could change our colour but he wouldn't let us.\" Strangely enough, the Lens players didn't seem to be as worried. As older readers will recall, Wenger's protests are strikingly similar to Fergie's moaning three years ago when United were thrashed 3-1 at Southampton. Then, the Fergster blamed the defeat on his players not being able to spot each other in their grey shirts. All we need now is for Wenger to buff his nose into a purple-red sheen and start shaking a stopwatch angrily at the referee at the end of each match, and the transformation will be complete. SATURDAY CAN BE SWEET Think of us as an tightwad ambassador trying to force cheap chocolate down your scraggy neck. \"Why Fiver! With Football Unlimited's unrivalled Saturday service - latest scores, match reports by 7pm and the very best in comment from the Observer - you are really spoiling us!\" NEW MUSICAL EXCESS Yo, kick-and-rush the show! Trendy music guru MC Fiver is back, keeping you abreast of the latest news whilst simultaneously keeping it real in your homies and hanging with your hood. The latest word on the pavement concerns the Football Association of Wales, who are planning a pre-match musical carnival before their friendly against Brazil on May 23. According to an FAW spokesman, this is because they want to \"give the crowd a lift and give the whole stadium a party atmosphere\". So have they planned a joyous samba shindig which will create that special Brazilian festive spirit? Not exactly... step forward earnest troubadours Manic Street Preachers, who will kick off the good times with fun single If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next, a song addressing both the Spanish Civil War and the repeated selection of Mark Pembridge. Also lined up to \"keep the Welsh football buzz going\" are the Stereophonics - an inspired choice given that Welsh football is one-paced and without spark or direction. And that's not all - the FAW hope the krazy karnival will also feature pot-head popsters Super Furry Animals, whose single The International Language Of Screaming is likely to be revisited by Welsh manager Mark Hughes after the final whistle. MC Fiver is already queuing for his ticket. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"When I look at my squad and look at all the other squads - and I saw Italy play Spain last week - I can honestly say that with the players we've got, nobody else has got that strength in depth\" - Kelvin Koogan's analysis of all the Euro 2000 finalists was just about audible above his loudly flipping lid. THE ONLY WAY IS DOWN This week the previews concentrate on the bottom of the Premiership. God we're depressed. Bradford v Southampton Bradford can't afford anything but a win, while Southampton hope and pray for the three points which would see them all but safe. Someone's going to go home feeling really low. Robbie Blake is in line for a recall, so either Jorge Cadete, Dean Saunders or Dean Windass will have their day ruined. Saints fans will be slightly cheered by the return of fat-but-loved Matthew Le Tissier, but any momentary happiness will be ruined by the sad news that Claus Lundekvam is still fit. Where's the Prozac? Sunderland v Wimbledon Sunderland's 37-year-old defender Steve Bould returns from injury to make his 500th league appearance. It's awful when the best times are behind you. Meanwhile, relegation-haunted Wimbledon welcome back Ben Thatcher and Hermann Hreidarsson, but Carl Cort is still out of action. So where are the goals going to come from? Keep the warm water running! Watford v Derby Watford are as good as down, but you never know... a couple of good wins could help. What's that? Suspensions to Mark Williams and Paul Robinson and injuries to Paul Kennedy, Nordin Wooter and Heidar Helgusson have decimated their squad? Aaargh! Derby are unchanged after their pleasing 3-0 trouncing of Leicester, which means Dean Sturridge keeps his place up front alongside Branko Strupar. But they're not out of the woods yet and they're living on their nerves. It's hell living like that, we tell you, hell! Chelsea v Newcastle (Sunday) Not technically a relegation battle, because it's an FA Cup semi-final. But misery still waits in the wings. Frank Leboeuf and Jon Harley replace Emerson Thome and Celestine Babayaro in a Chelsea side on a high. The problem with feeling that good, though, is that you've got further to fall when everything goes wrong. As it inevitably will. Steve Howey, Nikos Dabizas, Kevin Gallacher, Nolberto Solano and Diego Gavilan all return to Bobby Robson's squad, but Newcastle, the FA Cup and inner torment always go hand in hand, don't they? Must these black clouds always follow us around? THE RUMOUR MILL Leeds will bid for Bayern Munich striker Carsten Janker, according to Planet Football. The striker is unlikely to leave his native Germany, however. Fenerbahce are stepping up their chase for Chelsea's Gianfranco Zola. NEWS IN BRIEF A man has confessed to stabbing one of the two Leeds fans killed in clashes before the Uefa Cup semi-final against Galatasaray in Istanbul on Wednesday. Ali Umit Demir told police \"I stabbed him\" and led them to the knife used in the attack. Police in Istanbul would not say whether Demir was suspected of stabbing Christopher Loftus or Kevin Speight. In all, 13 men are in custody over the trouble including seven being questioned specifically about the killings. Another man is said to be still at large and police are hoping to track him down via one of the other suspects. Meanwhile, the Turkish Football Association have written to Leeds United to express their sadness at the deaths of Loftus and Speight. \"It is not in the spirit of sport and we do not want to see anything like this happening again,\" said the letter. The TFA's action comes after the FA branded Galatasaray's failure to hold a minute's silence or wear black armbands during last night's Uefa Cup semi-final as \"inappropriate\". Jean Tigana has confirmed he has been in contact with Fulham over the vacant manager's job. \"If anything's going to happen it will be next week,\" said the former French midfielder and Monaco boss. Southampton goalkeeper Paul Jones will undergo surgery this weekend in a bid to cure a back injury that is threatening to end the Welsh international's career. Jones, 32, will have an operation over the weekend to have a disc removed from his back. He will be sidelined for at least the next three months and has been given an 80% chance of making a full recovery. Falkirk manager Alex Totten has won his third consecutive Bell's Scottish manager of the month award. TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO Sky Sports 1: Futbol Mundial (5pm) Let nation bring fut onto nation.

His defence then was self-defence and the jury acquitted him. Noye, who is also claiming he killed Stephen Cameron in self-defence during a fight on the M25 in Kent in 1996, told the jury in his Old Bailey murder trial that he had found the camouflaged officer in his garden at 6.10pm on January 26, 1985 after his dogs had barked. He gave details of the incident as he explained to the jury why he fled to Spain the day after Mr Cameron was stabbed to death. Noye said he had never been convicted of violence - but in July 1986, after the Dc Fordham stabbing, he was jailed for 14 years for dishonestly handling stolen Brinks Mat gold. Noye claimed the way the press had reported his acquittal in the Fordham case was \"absolutely scandalous\". They had not accepted the jury's verdict.

Earlier today, he told the Old Bailey how he \"just struck out\" with his lock-knife and stabbed electrician Stephen Cameron to death. Demonstrating an underarm jab from the witness box, the grey-haired 52-year-old told the court: \"I can only ever remember striking out once, but I accept it was twice.\" He said his much younger victim had subjected him to a flurry of kicks and punches on an M25 slip road at Swanley, Kent, and repeatedly threatened to kill him.

      "trailText": "<p><strong>Peter Bradshaw:</strong> In her through-the-looking-glass Madame Butterfly fable of the mid-west, Kimberly Peirce has found transgression and transcendence, and brought love into sharper focus... a gripping film</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> \"Why can't you just admit you're a dyke?\" yells Teena Brandon's cousin. \"Because I'm not a dyke,\" Teena screams back. In that exchange is the genesis of Kimberly Peirce's compelling debut feature, Boys Don't Cry, based on the true story from 1993 of a teenage girl who reversed her surname, first name and sexual identity to become Brandon Teena, with a balled-up sock down her shorts and taped-up breasts, a likeable bright-eyed ing\u00e9nu(e) who turns up in the no-horse town of Falls City, Nebraska. </p> <p>This is a place of incredible boredom, where the big deal is to chase bats, go bumper-surfing (hanging off the back of a pick-up from a rope) or lie on your back in the yard hoovering up the compressor gases from a solvent spray. John (Peter Sarsgaard) is a wild local dude, and Tom (Brendan Sexton III) is his cringing buddy; both of them are on the margins of trouble with the police, both have issues with \"impulse control\". It is under their malign scrutiny that gender outlaw Brandon persuades Lana (Chlo\u00eb Sevigny), a sweet local girl, to fall in love with him/her - with tragic results. </p> <p>Brandon Teena considers herself to be a man, and Lana feels the same way, even when the truth is revealed. And Peirce's direction endows their love with an exquisite element of fantasy, role-playing, romance and escape: a secret masked ball of forbidden love in this dire trailer-park world. Brandon has entered into the male role of heterosexual love more intensely, more fervently, than any biological male could, because this is what Brandon has chosen . It is a gesture at once of love for Lana and of ecstatic self-realisation, and this moves Lana profoundly, and makes this such an affecting love story. </p> <p>As Brandon, Hilary Swank has won golden opinions, quite rightly, and now an Academy Award, with a performance of enormous courage and conviction. With her new short hair, which Brandon is always nervously flicking and adjusting in the mirror, and a coltish, loose-limbed persona, she is engaging and lovable.

In Brandon and Lana's story, Peirce defamiliarises and makes strange the act of love; she foregrounds the social stratagems and the choreography that express and liberate love.

(The time-lapse photography sequences of the rushing city nights are a little cliched, too.) But this is still a gripping film. In the promotional material, the producers suggest a literary antecedent in Truman Capote, and this is probably true. But the shock Lana feels in seeing Brandon Teena's name switched into \"Teena Brandon\" in a local newspaper report is not a mile away from Humbert Humbert's fetishistic ecstasy in Lolita in seeing his beloved name reversed into \"Haze, Dolores\" in a school record, the names transposed like gloves.

      "bodyText": "\"Why can't you just admit you're a dyke?\" yells Teena Brandon's cousin. \"Because I'm not a dyke,\" Teena screams back. In that exchange is the genesis of Kimberly Peirce's compelling debut feature, Boys Don't Cry, based on the true story from 1993 of a teenage girl who reversed her surname, first name and sexual identity to become Brandon Teena, with a balled-up sock down her shorts and taped-up breasts, a likeable bright-eyed ing\u00e9nu(e) who turns up in the no-horse town of Falls City, Nebraska. This is a place of incredible boredom, where the big deal is to chase bats, go bumper-surfing (hanging off the back of a pick-up from a rope) or lie on your back in the yard hoovering up the compressor gases from a solvent spray. John (Peter Sarsgaard) is a wild local dude, and Tom (Brendan Sexton III) is his cringing buddy; both of them are on the margins of trouble with the police, both have issues with \"impulse control\". It is under their malign scrutiny that gender outlaw Brandon persuades Lana (Chlo\u00eb Sevigny), a sweet local girl, to fall in love with him/her - with tragic results. Brandon Teena considers herself to be a man, and Lana feels the same way, even when the truth is revealed. And Peirce's direction endows their love with an exquisite element of fantasy, role-playing, romance and escape: a secret masked ball of forbidden love in this dire trailer-park world. Brandon has entered into the male role of heterosexual love more intensely, more fervently, than any biological male could, because this is what Brandon has chosen . It is a gesture at once of love for Lana and of ecstatic self-realisation, and this moves Lana profoundly, and makes this such an affecting love story. As Brandon, Hilary Swank has won golden opinions, quite rightly, and now an Academy Award, with a performance of enormous courage and conviction. With her new short hair, which Brandon is always nervously flicking and adjusting in the mirror, and a coltish, loose-limbed persona, she is engaging and lovable. And this vulnerability is almost unbearable when she is brutalised and killed by the moronic good ol' boys who can't handle the truth about the guy they've been hanging out with and who's been dating a local girl. Swank is undoubtedly powerful but I think she is actually matched, and perhaps even subtly outclassed by Sevigny, who has here given a performance in advance of anything she has produced so far. Her slightly pallid, petulant presence can often seem ungenerous and opaque, but here she is just right: the quintessence of normality to set against this exquisite Ganymede whose destiny is hitched to hers.

He has dismissed the claims in the 1984 intelligence briefing as a \"pathetic fabrication\". Yet regardless of the veracity of the document, the upshot of this segment of the inquiry will be the chance for lawyers to grill Mr McGuinness in public about his role inside the Provisional IRA during the early 1970s.

Earlier this week a former Derry priest and secret negotiator between the Provisional IRA and the British government for many years, Denis Bradley, told Saville he was concerned about the role of the Official IRA before the Civil Rights march in the city that ended in the massacre.

What, however, this complex anatomy of a day in Derry at the height of the Troubles shows is that truth is not selective and contains embarrassing elements for all those involved in the Northern Ireland conflict over the last three decades.

Customers and politicians from all parties have condemned the move, which comes in the same week that the bank revealed top directors are in line for lucrative pay increases. People living in rural areas have complained the move will leave some communities with journeys of up to 20 miles to a bank. Barclays has confirmed that there would be some job losses among staff but said it did not have a precise figure. However, just hours before the closures were due to take effect, the company attempted to appease customers by announcing that a deal had been struck with the Post Office to offer some level of service in affected areas. Barclays retail banking director John Varley said that people using the 171 branches set to close would be able to carry out basic banking transactions at their local post-offices. He told the BBC's Watchdog programme: \"We have had a pilot with the Post Office in Cornwall to try to help customers where we are withdrawing from certain areas. \"After listening to our customers, we will have, within three weeks, in collaboration with the Post Office, arrangements in each of the areas where we are closing banks to help those customers cash cheques, pay in and withdraw money.\" While the move is unlikely to pacify those bitterly opposed to the closures, it might help calm the furious row ignited by environment minister Chris Mullin's comments that Barclays customers should \"vote with their feet\" over the closure plans. Barclays will now have 1,550 branches, compared with 2,000 in 1995 and more than 2,400 in 1991. Last year the bank made record profits of \u00a32.4bn and last week it revealed it had paid its new chief executive, Matthew Barrett, \u00a31.3m for just three months in the job. But Barclays argues it needs to move with the times, claiming that less than 40% of customers now use its branches because of an explosion in the use of cash machines, telephone and online banking. Company bosses are instead putting more resources into other branches and into telephone banking and online banking. Mr Varley said he apologised for the inconvenience caused to customers but insisted it was important for the bank to make a profit. \"There has been a sea change, a seismic change in the way in which customers choose to bank in the United Kingdom. \"If we ignore that then we will go out of business and this country is littered with the carcasses of businesses that have failed to move with the times. \"Look at NatWest, our biggest competitor - taken over.

      "body": "<p>A dedicated primary school teacher killed herself after being devastated by a bad Ofsted report and criticism of her classroom performance, an inquest heard yesterday. </p> <p>Pamela Relf, 57, could not take the pressures of modern teaching after an otherwise trouble free career spanning 36 years. </p> <p>She jumped into a river on a January day, leaving a note addressed to a coroner making her plight clear. \"I am now finding the stress of my job too much. The pace of work and the long days are more than I can do,\" she wrote. </p> <p>The teacher who had devoted her life to her profession found the large number of government and local initiatives difficult to reconcile, the inquest at Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, was told. </p> <p>As the longest serving teacher at Middlefield primary school in Eynesbury she could not bear to return to work after criticism by Ofsted inspectors, which left her stressed and tearful. </p> <p>After the inquest, her brother David Relf attacked the way teachers were treated. \"I think her death says something about the role of teachers in our society and the pressures in terms of paperwork,\" he said. \"Society has changed and the education system is not coping with the way it has changed and has put the burden of stress on teachers.\" </p> <p>The school's head, Brian Rayner, was equally critical of the mounting pressures on staff. In a statement he said: \"Like her colleagues in this and all schools, there was often the feeling of running to stand still and like all of us, she felt the pressure that resulted.\" </p> <p>After one of her lessons had been inspected, Mr Rayner found her to be \"in a stressed state. She was tearful, having been told by the inspector that she lacked pace in her lesson. I have never before seen Pamela in such a state and consoled her as best I could. It concerned me that the school's most senior teacher had been reduced to such a state at this early stage of the inspection. </p> <p>\"Pamela seemed unduly nervous for the rest of the week, especially when the inspectors were in her classroom. Pamela looked particularly demoralised during a feedback session. I recall thinking how drawn and stressed she looked.\" He was critical of the Ofsted inspection, two months before her death, which had highlighted several areas of concern. </p> <p>Miss Relf's body was discovered in a river at a nature reserve close to her home in Eaton Ford seven weeks after her car was found abandoned at a beauty spot at Little Paxton, the inquest was told. She had disappeared on her way to work on January 4, a day before the start of the new term. </p> <p>Her 92-year-old father, who lived with her, heard her leave their house as usual at 8.20am for a staff meeting. But she never arrived at work and worried colleagues later raised the alarm. </p> <p>Her disappearance sparked a search involving more than 20 police officers, five tracker dogs and the Cambridgeshire force helicopter. Teaching staff and other colleagues at the school were among those who turned out to search for her. </p> <p>She died from cold water immersion, the inquest heard. The shock of the cold water had caused her heart to stop. </p> <p>Recording a verdict of suicide while she was suffering from depression, the coroner, Colin Latimore, said Miss Relf had clearly become depressed over the preceding months. \"Inspections of any type are stressful by their very nature, sometimes more stressful than others,\" he said. </p> <p>The 247-pupil school was inspected at the end of November last year and was found to have serious weaknesses that affected the standard of education. The inspectors found that reading standards among younger children were below national averages and writing was well below. In 23% of the lessons, they observed, the teaching was unsatisfactory or poor. </p> <p>They concluded: \"Leadership and management of the school is unsatisfactory overall.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "A dedicated primary school teacher killed herself after being devastated by a bad Ofsted report and criticism of her classroom performance, an inquest heard yesterday. Pamela Relf, 57, could not take the pressures of modern teaching after an otherwise trouble free career spanning 36 years. She jumped into a river on a January day, leaving a note addressed to a coroner making her plight clear. \"I am now finding the stress of my job too much. The pace of work and the long days are more than I can do,\" she wrote. The teacher who had devoted her life to her profession found the large number of government and local initiatives difficult to reconcile, the inquest at Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, was told. As the longest serving teacher at Middlefield primary school in Eynesbury she could not bear to return to work after criticism by Ofsted inspectors, which left her stressed and tearful. After the inquest, her brother David Relf attacked the way teachers were treated. \"I think her death says something about the role of teachers in our society and the pressures in terms of paperwork,\" he said. \"Society has changed and the education system is not coping with the way it has changed and has put the burden of stress on teachers.\" The school's head, Brian Rayner, was equally critical of the mounting pressures on staff. In a statement he said: \"Like her colleagues in this and all schools, there was often the feeling of running to stand still and like all of us, she felt the pressure that resulted.\" After one of her lessons had been inspected, Mr Rayner found her to be \"in a stressed state. She was tearful, having been told by the inspector that she lacked pace in her lesson. I have never before seen Pamela in such a state and consoled her as best I could. It concerned me that the school's most senior teacher had been reduced to such a state at this early stage of the inspection. \"Pamela seemed unduly nervous for the rest of the week, especially when the inspectors were in her classroom. Pamela looked particularly demoralised during a feedback session. I recall thinking how drawn and stressed she looked.\" He was critical of the Ofsted inspection, two months before her death, which had highlighted several areas of concern. Miss Relf's body was discovered in a river at a nature reserve close to her home in Eaton Ford seven weeks after her car was found abandoned at a beauty spot at Little Paxton, the inquest was told. She had disappeared on her way to work on January 4, a day before the start of the new term. Her 92-year-old father, who lived with her, heard her leave their house as usual at 8.20am for a staff meeting. But she never arrived at work and worried colleagues later raised the alarm. Her disappearance sparked a search involving more than 20 police officers, five tracker dogs and the Cambridgeshire force helicopter. Teaching staff and other colleagues at the school were among those who turned out to search for her. She died from cold water immersion, the inquest heard. The shock of the cold water had caused her heart to stop. Recording a verdict of suicide while she was suffering from depression, the coroner, Colin Latimore, said Miss Relf had clearly become depressed over the preceding months. \"Inspections of any type are stressful by their very nature, sometimes more stressful than others,\" he said. The 247-pupil school was inspected at the end of November last year and was found to have serious weaknesses that affected the standard of education. The inspectors found that reading standards among younger children were below national averages and writing was well below. In 23% of the lessons, they observed, the teaching was unsatisfactory or poor. They concluded: \"Leadership and management of the school is unsatisfactory overall.\"",

The weapons named were knives of many varieties - flick, switch, Stanley, craft, and hunting - as well as machetes, swords, razors, air rifles, pistols, replica guns, clubs, metal pipes, baseball bats, snooker cues, screwdrivers, hammers, catapults and knuckle-dusters. </p> <p>The west of Scotland has long had an association with weapon carrying and gang fighting, write the researchers. \"The culture of weapon carrying among young people seems to be continuing although it is not confined to any one city.

John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, was due to announce government plans for the future of waste disposal on the day the Guardian revealed details of the scams happening under the new tax regime. Yesterday's disclosures of large scale illegal dumping have added to serious concerns in the No 10 policy unit, in customs and excise, the Treasury, and the environment department, about the effectiveness of the present waste policy. Leaked pages from the government's white paper on waste reveal that Mr Prescott was about to praise the role of the private company Entrust, which is in charge of policing \u00a3250m of donations from the waste industry for environmental schemes in lieu of paying 20% of the tax. The key paragraph reads: \"An important strength of the scheme is that it encourages private sector involvement in projects to protect the environment and improve local amenities.

Given the current nature of the scheme, it is not possible to fund either commercial activities or local authority operations.\" On Wednesday the Guardian disclosed that the waste industry appeared to be able to distort the funding of environmental projects to benefit landfill operators and their commercial activities - without breaking any regulations. The paper also revealed that 1,100 approved environmental bodies had never received any cash from landfill companies, and many of the environmental bodies which did receive large sums of cash had been set up by waste companies. One body, Canford Environmental, had given money to projects which appeared to benefit two companies that between them had five directors on the Canford board - although the rules permit this.

      "bodyText": "British Nuclear Fuels yesterday admitted breaching safety regulations after three of its workers were burned during a leak of corrosive acid at its Sellafield reprocessing plant. The men were injured at the Cumbrian plant in March last year when seven cubic metres of concentrated nitric acid escaped from a valve. The accident happened because managers had allowed a culture to grow in which working practices were not checked, Whitehaven magistrates heard. One worker would have suffered fatal burns had he not worn a protective chemical suit which was not routine for repair work, the court was told. British Nuclear Fuels plc and BNFL Engineering Limited pleaded guilty to failing to ensure safety of workers during commissioning and maintenance work. The court case came as it emerged that the government may decide to abandon reprocessing the remaining spent nuclear fuel at the Dounreay nuclear plant in Caithness, and instead store it - the first time in 50 years of the nuclear industry that storage and disposal has officially been considered an alternative to reprocessing by ministers. At Dounreay, the two experimental fast breeder reactors and other protoypes are already being dismantled, but Helen Liddell, energy minister, has yet to decide what to do about the reprocessing lines. Whitehaven magistrates heard yesterday that workers at BNFL's solvent treatment plant had taken to using their own system because procedures put in place by management were \"complicated and unworkable\". The case was subsequently adjourned to Carlisle crown court for sentencing to a date yet to be fixed. Yesterday Ms Liddell announced that in effect ministers will be letting the public decide what happens to the fuel at Dounreay by inviting the people to choose from three options. The Dounreay works, which employs 2,000 people, was created at one of the remotest spots in mainland Britain because of the potential danger. The three alternatives are to repair the lines and complete the reprocessing of 25 tonnes of fuel; close the plant and send the fuel to the Thorp reprocessing works in Cumbria to be dealt with; or to dry store the fuel and eventually, in around 50 years, find an underground vault in which to dispose of it. This third option is what environmental groups have been demanding for years - not just at Dounreay but at Sellafield. Their argument is that reprocessing is more expensive than storage and recovers pure bomb-making plutonium from the fuel, which would otherwise remain locked up and be no use to anyone. The nuclear industry has resisted an end to reprocessing because it says that to store and dispose of fuel is a waste. The plutonium is too valuable as a potential energy source not to recover it. The government has yet to decide between the two arguments - particularly a recommendation by the House of Lords science and technology committee that plutonium should be reclassified from the most valuable metal in the world to a nuclear waste.",

Twenty years after Mrs Thatcher axed the link between earnings and the state pension, Tony Blair yesterday restored it for the country's 10m pensioners, under pressure from Tony Benn, Jack Jones, Barbara Castle and Age Concern.\"</p> <p>Imagine the scene in the Commons, the celebrations among the 41 Labour MPs who rebelled against the social security bill this week. MPs quivering nervously in marginal seats, fearing an anti-Labour swing will sweep them away, would rise to their feet, stamping, shouting and waving order papers. The Tories would sit there like a row of popped balloons. Labour heartlands would throw their hats in the air, Roy Hattersley would have to eat his again.</p> <p>But it didn't happen. Instead that pathetic 75p increase made sour headlines, lifting the basic pension to just \u00a366.75 a week. Why, flush with money, did Labour go for the bad news story and eschew a good news quick hit? Was it simple Treasury parsimony? No, not at all. Here is a truly remarkable fact: if Labour had decided to restore the link the day they came to power it would have cost less, not more, than they are currently spending on pensioner benefits. They would have saved a huge \u00a3800m over the last three years - and won the hearts of the pensioner lobby by spending less. So why didn't they?</p> <p>Because they did the right thing and not the popular thing. They redistributed wealth from rich to poor pensioners and spent \u00a3800m more on the poorest, as well as offering free TV licences, letting claimants keep more savings and cutting their tax rates. It should have pleased the left - but they seem to have lost the plot on this. The basic pension is withering away because it goes to growing numbers of newly retired people who are well off, each cohort retiring richer than the last. Only read the Saga brochures aimed at their disposable wealth for cruises and leisure of every kind. How much better than in Beveridge's day when to be old was almost universally to be poor.</p> <p>In the last 20 years, as with all incomes, a huge gap has opened up between poor and rich pensioners: it no longer makes sense to pay them all the same. Far too many are pitifully poor - but increasing the state pension wastes money on the one-third who don't need it, while it doesn't put an extra penny more into the pockets of the poorest third who don't get it.</p> <p>The government's minimum income guarantee (MIG) for the poorest ensures no one gets less than \u00a378.45 a week (and more for the older ones). It isn't enough and pensions minister Jeff Rooker admits it. \"It's not comfortable,\" he says, plainly embarrassed by the Lord Falconer's flippant claim that he could live on it, no problem. Rooker hopes it will rise faster over the next years and so it must. Age Concern points to the 60% of pensioners who live on less than \u00a3100 a week: they reckon MIG should be set at \u00a390. Labour has indexed MIG to earnings so it will rise far faster than the basic pension - but it still needs more. However, Labour has made the poorest pensioners a real \u00a35.40 a week better off already under MIG - money they wouldn't have had if the government had chosen the populist route, earnings-linking the basic pension instead.</p> <p>All this is complicated. Eyes glaze over, few bother with the intricacies of the social security system or even of their own pensions. That's the government's headache. How do they explain they've done well for the neediest pensioners if no one understands it? Every vox pop has punters saying things like \"How can a pensioner live on just \u00a366.75? It's disgusting.\" But no one was ever expected to live on the basic pension. Even Beveridge, at the start of national insurance, didn't make the basic pension reach national assistance level: every poor pensioner was always means tested and topped up. Those against targeting pretend it's a Thatcherite phenomenon, but there was never a halcyon time when the basic pension was enough to live on. Sometimes explaining this fact seems like a hopeless cause. The idea that this government is good at spin is bonkers. They are completely hopeless at it.</p> <p>The anti-means-test lobby, however, has one good point. Although 1.6m pensioners fill out their forms and get their MIG, as many as 700,000 may miss out, perhaps trying to survive on the non-survivable basic pension - a horrible thought. Finding the missing pensioners has now become top priority, with Thora Hird kicking off a TV take-up campaign next month.</p> <p>Research suggests it is not pensioner pride but ignorance that stops them claiming. Trawling through records, the DSS is looking for all who have no other source of income. Many may be living with their families, wrongly assuming this disqualifies them from MIG. A new help-line* brought in 11,500 inquiries in just three days and all pensioners will get a letter. The 40-page income support form is a nightmare, but soon local pensions offices set up in libraries or local Age Concern facilities (definitely not in stigmatising benefits offices), will answer queries and a new hotline will do all the form filling.</p> <p>A new pensions ministry, completely separated from other benefits, will pay out and give pensions advice to old and young, urging everyone to save more for their old age. The most startling change will be a written annual statement for every worker, listing all their private and state entitlements so everyone can be warned in time if they are not saving enough. Stakeholder pensions will offer a very good deal, kite marked private pensions with very low administration charges. People can move in and out of them freely, watching how well they are scoring in league tables in a very competitive market.</p> <p>But there is a trap - an intellectual problem the government cannot resolve. If MIG rises to a civilised level - say \u00a390 a week - it's not worth people on lower incomes paying into a stakeholder pension which will never lift them above that. Yet it's the lower income people the government means to target. These new pensions offices will need to be watched like a hawk for any sign of mis-selling to them. Ah, says Rooker, of course low earners should still buy stakeholders since no one can trust governments to provide enough pension in some 40 years time. Governments often renege: saving privately with a stakeholder is the only guarantee. But if we are entering Blair's new social democratic century in a time of plenty, then low earners deserve to spend their meagre money here and now (or on a mortgage, perhaps) and let the better off pay for their old age later.</p> <p>Meanwhile, every year at up-rating time the ritual dance of old Labour MPs demanding the restoration of the universal pension will continue. They seem to be campaigning for the rich who have soared ahead of the rest to get more, instead of pressing for far more MIG for the poor to redress this inequality.

      "bodyText": "Russia was last night facing suspension from the Council of Europe after furious denunciations of its brutality during the war in Chechnya. The parliamentary assembly of Europe's top human rights body, which is separate from the EU, voted to punish Russia if it did not immediately agree to a ceasefire and to talks with rebel leaders. Crucially, however, suspension has to be approved by member governments, which have so far proved conspicuously reluctant to match verbal condemnation of Russia with practical measures. In the course of weeks of campaigning, human rights lobbyists expressed disquiet at the role of the British government in seeking to moderate criticism of Russia, which joined the council in 1996. A suspension would be unprecedented in the 51-year history of the Strasbourg-based council - and would be a symbolic blow to Russian aspirations for closer ties with European institutions. It could also affect financial assistance from bodies such as the World Bank. \"This is a real milestone,\" said one delighted official. '\"It sends a very clear signal that Russia must act.

My son took staff into his department from five other branches which were closed down. Naturally, his responsibilities in staff size and budget increased dramatically and he also had the burden of dealing with the personnel problems raised by this process. Nevertheless, he achieved all the agreed targets set for him.</p> <p>Because of the extra responsibilities, my son's job was regraded so that he should have had a significant increase in pay. However, although the job was regraded, Barclays refused to pay him this grade as they said they had a rota for staff to be upgraded and he would have to wait his turn! He waited for more than two years. The final straw came under the performance-related pay deal Barclays offered. He achieved all his targets and exceeded the profit levels set. But, together with other managers, he received a note saying that because his boss had failed to achieve his performance target, none of the managers in his division would get bonuses. This grossly unfair decision was upheld when my son appealed, pointing out that but for the excellent performances of managers such as him, his boss's failure would have been even worse. There was no excuse for Barclays' parsimony at this time - they were showing a healthy trading profit. In disgust my son resigned, even though he had no job to go to.</p> <p>Having rewarded its loyal staff at 172 branches with redundancy, Barclays may at last be shamed into doing the decent thing for its employees - but I wouldn't bank on it.<br><b>Ted Dutton</b><br>Hereford</p> <p>\u0095 Ignoring the bonus, no business tycoon can possibly believe that two days of Mr Barrett's superb management activity are worth about the same as a year's work by an average doctor, much more than a year's work by a senior university lecturer and he needs to work only one day to achieve as much as the average teacher or nurse does in a year. The salaries are set by the recipients themselves and demonstrate unbridled greed. To say they could be stopped from setting their own salaries so high by shareholders is also nonsense. Their biggest shareholders are corporations whose managers have a vested interest in not rocking the boat. It's time this government (it is, after all, a Labour government, I believe?) set the tax rates for salaries and commission/bonuses above say \u00a3500,000 at such a level as to make nonsense of them.<br><b>IJ Gibson</b><br>Ullapool, Ross-shire</p> <p>\u0095 If bank managers need so much money to live on, then they can't be very good managers - what on earth do they spend it all on?<br><b>Ted Prangnell</b><br>Ashford, Kent<br><a href=\"mailto:ted@tprangnell.freeserve.co.uk\">ted@tprangnell.freeserve.co.uk</a></p> <p>\u0095 Is it not time for the debate concerning the purpose, content and structure of core company law to reach an audience far wider than it has thus far received?<br><b>Robert Goddard</b><br>Cambridge</p> <p>\u0095 You report (Labour accused in banks dispute, April 5) that banks are closing large numbers of branches in rural areas. Perhaps this is to be expected among institutions responsive to shareholder rather than consumer interests. Research at the University of Newcastle shows that between 1995 and 1998 building societies, which do not have shareholders, were more likely than banks, or former societies that have converted to banks, to maintain their branch network and that, if they did close branches, societies were less likely than banks or converters to withdraw services from more socially deprived locations. During this period building societies added to their branch network; banks reduced theirs.</p> <p>A similar comparison can be made on ATM charges. The vast majority of ATM cards issued by building societies have always given access to the Link network free of charge. Those few societies that did make charges have announced these are to disappear shortly - the opposite trend exhibited by banks.<br><b>Adrian Coles</b><br>Building Societies Association</p> <p>\u0095 Last Thursday morning I telephoned the Co-op bank to request a transfer of funds to my Tesco bank account.

However, although the job was regraded, Barclays refused to pay him this grade as they said they had a rota for staff to be upgraded and he would have to wait his turn! He waited for more than two years. The final straw came under the performance-related pay deal Barclays offered. He achieved all his targets and exceeded the profit levels set. But, together with other managers, he received a note saying that because his boss had failed to achieve his performance target, none of the managers in his division would get bonuses. This grossly unfair decision was upheld when my son appealed, pointing out that but for the excellent performances of managers such as him, his boss's failure would have been even worse. There was no excuse for Barclays' parsimony at this time - they were showing a healthy trading profit. In disgust my son resigned, even though he had no job to go to. Having rewarded its loyal staff at 172 branches with redundancy, Barclays may at last be shamed into doing the decent thing for its employees - but I wouldn't bank on it. Ted Dutton Hereford \u0095 Ignoring the bonus, no business tycoon can possibly believe that two days of Mr Barrett's superb management activity are worth about the same as a year's work by an average doctor, much more than a year's work by a senior university lecturer and he needs to work only one day to achieve as much as the average teacher or nurse does in a year. The salaries are set by the recipients themselves and demonstrate unbridled greed. To say they could be stopped from setting their own salaries so high by shareholders is also nonsense. Their biggest shareholders are corporations whose managers have a vested interest in not rocking the boat. It's time this government (it is, after all, a Labour government, I believe?) set the tax rates for salaries and commission/bonuses above say \u00a3500,000 at such a level as to make nonsense of them. IJ Gibson Ullapool, Ross-shire \u0095 If bank managers need so much money to live on, then they can't be very good managers - what on earth do they spend it all on? Ted Prangnell Ashford, Kent ted@tprangnell.freeserve.co.uk \u0095 Is it not time for the debate concerning the purpose, content and structure of core company law to reach an audience far wider than it has thus far received? Robert Goddard Cambridge \u0095 You report (Labour accused in banks dispute, April 5) that banks are closing large numbers of branches in rural areas. Perhaps this is to be expected among institutions responsive to shareholder rather than consumer interests. Research at the University of Newcastle shows that between 1995 and 1998 building societies, which do not have shareholders, were more likely than banks, or former societies that have converted to banks, to maintain their branch network and that, if they did close branches, societies were less likely than banks or converters to withdraw services from more socially deprived locations. During this period building societies added to their branch network; banks reduced theirs. A similar comparison can be made on ATM charges. The vast majority of ATM cards issued by building societies have always given access to the Link network free of charge. Those few societies that did make charges have announced these are to disappear shortly - the opposite trend exhibited by banks. Adrian Coles Building Societies Association \u0095 Last Thursday morning I telephoned the Co-op bank to request a transfer of funds to my Tesco bank account. That afternoon I posted a clipping from the Guardian to my son in Japan. Monday afternoon I received an email from my son thanking me for the clipping. That night I bought some food in Tesco, but payment via my Tesco card was refused - the money hadn't arrived. I can't help wondering how much of our money the banks have \"in transit\" every night and how much they earn from it. Gerry Mewton Reading GMewton2@aol.com",

Temperatures in Britain would drop about 5C and Norway would suffer a 10C fall. \"It would not make us like Spitsbergen but it would be a very dramatic, serious change in the climate.\"</p> <p>The Gulf stream flows north from the Caribbean, keeping Britain at least 5C warmer than expected at its latitude. Britain's chief scientist, Sir Robert May, once calculated that it delivered 27,000 times the warmth that all Britain's power stations could supply.</p> <p>It merges with the north Atlantic current and the encounter of this giant, warm surface river with the Arctic winter ice is a powerful part of the convection machine which keeps the ocean swirling.</p> <p>Ice is fresh water - so the sea that remains is increasingly cold, salty and dense. It sinks, beginning a kind of submarine river, 30 times the volume of the Amazon, flowing south again.</p> <p>But the Arctic ice cover is in retreat - shrinking by an area the size of the Netherlands every year. It is also thinning, from more than three metres thick to less than two metres in 30 years.</p> <p>What worried Dr Wadhams and his Arctic colleagues meeting in Cambridge yesterday was the failure, once again, of the huge Greenland ice tongue. It was a powerful agent in the ocean mixing system - and there were signs that the ocean circulation had begun to flag.</p> <p>\"Climate models predict that this process will continue, that there will be a continued loss of convection from the Greenland sea and also the Labrador sea,\" said Dr Wadhams. \"When these both turn off, which will happen within the next 30 years, then the result will be a much slower transport of heat by the ocean from the tropics to our latitudes. And that will mean a cooling for Europe, and especially north west Europe.\"</p> <p>This week climate scientists announced dramatic losses in the ozone layer over the Arctic, and blamed global warming in the lower atmosphere. Paradoxically, although the Arctic is warming - driven by the \"greenhouse effect\" of carbon dioxide from worldwide use of coal, natural gas and petrol - Britain could be condemned to a much colder future. Nations signed up to agreement in Kyoto in 1997 to reduce carbon dioxide emissions - but that may not be enough.</p> <p>\"If nations don't do what they say they are going to do, carbon dioxide emissions will be greater,\" said Dr Wadhams. \"So the assumptions built into all this modelling is that CO2 will reach a peak eventually, and then fall off according to the Kyoto agreement. The Kyoto agreement enshrines what nations think they can manage. So I don't think there is anything anybody can do to fend this off.\"</p> <p>Because the world is warming - glaciers everywhere are in retreat, springs are arriving earlier and autumns later, and six of the 10 warmest years ever recorded occurred in the 1990s - the effects would be slow.</p> <p>\"Europe won't see a dramatic cooling until the beginning of the next century,\" said Dr Wadhams. \"It is just that we won't warm as fast as everybody else. The dramatic changes are already beginning to happen in the ocean but the greenhouse effect will stave it off. It will take 100 years for the climate of Britain and Norway to start to cool.\"</p>",

Temperatures in Britain would drop about 5C and Norway would suffer a 10C fall. \"It would not make us like Spitsbergen but it would be a very dramatic, serious change in the climate.\" The Gulf stream flows north from the Caribbean, keeping Britain at least 5C warmer than expected at its latitude. Britain's chief scientist, Sir Robert May, once calculated that it delivered 27,000 times the warmth that all Britain's power stations could supply. It merges with the north Atlantic current and the encounter of this giant, warm surface river with the Arctic winter ice is a powerful part of the convection machine which keeps the ocean swirling. Ice is fresh water - so the sea that remains is increasingly cold, salty and dense. It sinks, beginning a kind of submarine river, 30 times the volume of the Amazon, flowing south again. But the Arctic ice cover is in retreat - shrinking by an area the size of the Netherlands every year. It is also thinning, from more than three metres thick to less than two metres in 30 years. What worried Dr Wadhams and his Arctic colleagues meeting in Cambridge yesterday was the failure, once again, of the huge Greenland ice tongue. It was a powerful agent in the ocean mixing system - and there were signs that the ocean circulation had begun to flag. \"Climate models predict that this process will continue, that there will be a continued loss of convection from the Greenland sea and also the Labrador sea,\" said Dr Wadhams. \"When these both turn off, which will happen within the next 30 years, then the result will be a much slower transport of heat by the ocean from the tropics to our latitudes. And that will mean a cooling for Europe, and especially north west Europe.\" This week climate scientists announced dramatic losses in the ozone layer over the Arctic, and blamed global warming in the lower atmosphere. Paradoxically, although the Arctic is warming - driven by the \"greenhouse effect\" of carbon dioxide from worldwide use of coal, natural gas and petrol - Britain could be condemned to a much colder future. Nations signed up to agreement in Kyoto in 1997 to reduce carbon dioxide emissions - but that may not be enough. \"If nations don't do what they say they are going to do, carbon dioxide emissions will be greater,\" said Dr Wadhams. \"So the assumptions built into all this modelling is that CO2 will reach a peak eventually, and then fall off according to the Kyoto agreement. The Kyoto agreement enshrines what nations think they can manage. So I don't think there is anything anybody can do to fend this off.\" Because the world is warming - glaciers everywhere are in retreat, springs are arriving earlier and autumns later, and six of the 10 warmest years ever recorded occurred in the 1990s - the effects would be slow. \"Europe won't see a dramatic cooling until the beginning of the next century,\" said Dr Wadhams. \"It is just that we won't warm as fast as everybody else. The dramatic changes are already beginning to happen in the ocean but the greenhouse effect will stave it off. It will take 100 years for the climate of Britain and Norway to start to cool.\"",

Around 3,000 fans of the Turkish club are expected to attend the match, most of them London-based fans of the team. The two Leeds supporters were believed to have been stabbed to death after an argument with a group of workmen. This arose, according to reports, because the Leeds men - after drinking all day - insulted the Turkish flag. The killings have overshadowed the Uefa semi-final, and back in Leeds scores of mourners left mementos at Elland Road. Sixteen Leeds United fans returned home yesterday afternoon after failing to get beyond Istanbul airport. They flew back into Manchester protesting at the way they had been treated. Elizabeth McAndrew and David Brown, both 32, complained of \"appalling treatment\" by Turkish police. \"We went to watch a game of football and instead I had my jewellery, including my engagement ring, taken from me,\" said Ms McAndrew. \"I was strip-searched and left in a cell for three hours on my own.\" Trying to establish who exactly was responsible for the knifings, Turkish police have taken witness statements and are planning a number of identification parades in the coming days. The sports secretary, Chris Smith, last night ordered an urgent report into the killings, and sent condolences to the families of the murdered men. Tony Blair appealed for calm. A Downing Street spokesman said: \"While the facts are being established his [the prime minister's] thoughts and the thoughts of everybody in the government are with the families of the two men.\" The chairman of Leeds, Peter Ridsdale, called the killings \"one of those black nights in history\". One of the fans who died, Christopher Loftus, was landlord of the Bay Horse Inn in Farsley, Leeds, and regularly organised travel to Leeds away games. The other dead man, Kevin Speight, leaves a wife and two children.",

      "bodyText": "Many of the treasures of Luton Hoo are to be sold off to save what remains of one of the country's greatest art collections. Old Master paintings, furniture and sculptures from the Wernher collection - gathered by the German-born diamond magnate Sir Julius Wernher, using the fortune he amassed in South Africa - are expected to make \u00a310m when they go under the hammer at Christie's in July. It is another chapter in the decline of one of the country's more exotic aristocratic families. Last year, Lucy Phillips was forced to sell off the Adam mansion in Hertfordshire which had housed the collection since the war. She has struggled for nine years to keep the estate and collection intact after the death of her husband in 1991. Nicholas Phillips, a godson of the Duke of Edinburgh, was found in his fume-filled car when the value of the business park he sank millions into just outside the estate slumped during the property crash. It has since more than tripled in value. Five years ago she sold St Michael Triumphant, a painting by the 15th century Spanish master Bartolome Bermejo, to the National Gallery for \u00a310m, and a sale of some of silver raised nearly \u00a35m the same year. The money is believed to have gone to fending off her husband's creditors. Two banks had sued her for \u00a321m in 1993. The highlights of the Christie's sale are two rare gothic Augsburg silver figures of St Sebastian and St Christopher, which are expected to make \u00a31m apiece, while a Titian portrait of Giacomo Doria could also make a seven-figure sum. A painting by Rubens, Diana with her Nymphs Hunting, and a work by the Renaissance painter Filippino Lippi, The Rest on the Flight to Egypt, will also go under the hammer. Almost everything is likely to be snapped up by overseas buyers. A Christie's spokeswoman said that a large part of the money realised by the sale would go towards preserving and displaying the remains of the Wernher collection in a house run by English Heritage.",

He spent every lesson telling us about the horrific ways in which we could die if we ignored safety requirements in the lab. <strong> Ray Mears' Extreme Survival</strong> (BBC 2) transferred this ghoulish alarmism to the desert. Ray was fun when he was drinking his own widdle and barbecuing witchety grubs, but he's been on a diet and gone all serious. Any viewers planning a joyride in their local desert were hauled up sharply, as Ray treated us to the haunting diary extracts of an airman who perished in the Sahara, mad with thirst.</p> <p> Without a flicker of irony, Ray then led us through the basics of wadi-survival, adding a shiversome anecdote about a man whose shins got cut to the bone. A more cheery account came from a German survivor, who'd sensibly remained with his vehicle and waited until help arrived. But Ray would not be upstaged. \"One more day and he'd have set off on foot,\" he pronounced snootily, upon not a shred of evidence. \"Then his chances would have been nil.\" </p> <p>At least Ray has found his niche. Less fortunate were Seth and Peter, one half of the couples in <strong> Love And Money</strong> (C4). Both chaps are house-husbands, and the producers wanted us to know it's no bed of roses. But they didn't quite pull it off. Certainly, neither man had an enviable lifestyle. But not because there's anything intrinsically wrong with blokes doing the ironing, more because the blokes in question were just crap at life. Peter claimed to be skint and happy - so why did he cherish the ludicrous goal of becoming an opera singer? Bronchitic polecats have sounded sweeter. And why he did he swap, halfway through, to becoming a songwriter? Because, perhaps, reality wasn't much fun?</p> <p> Seth's flaw was loving his wife Jan, who kidded herself she didn't want a rich husband. After much careful phrasing and many Freudian slips, she came clean. \"Respect for a partner is bound up in their ability to make money,\" she faltered.</p> <p> Small wonder that Seth, bound to such a partner, lacked the self-respect necessary to get his act together. Jan agreed that she should earn big bucks while Seth raised the child, but then she got resentful and chucked him out. We saw a poignant shot of their hallway, blank spaces where Seth's photos had hung. How did this make Jan feel? \"Not as sad as I thought.\" Little saddens Jan, one suspects, except pay cuts.</p>",

Without a flicker of irony, Ray then led us through the basics of wadi-survival, adding a shiversome anecdote about a man whose shins got cut to the bone. A more cheery account came from a German survivor, who'd sensibly remained with his vehicle and waited until help arrived. But Ray would not be upstaged. \"One more day and he'd have set off on foot,\" he pronounced snootily, upon not a shred of evidence. \"Then his chances would have been nil.\" At least Ray has found his niche. Less fortunate were Seth and Peter, one half of the couples in Love And Money (C4). Both chaps are house-husbands, and the producers wanted us to know it's no bed of roses. But they didn't quite pull it off. Certainly, neither man had an enviable lifestyle. But not because there's anything intrinsically wrong with blokes doing the ironing, more because the blokes in question were just crap at life. Peter claimed to be skint and happy - so why did he cherish the ludicrous goal of becoming an opera singer? Bronchitic polecats have sounded sweeter. And why he did he swap, halfway through, to becoming a songwriter? Because, perhaps, reality wasn't much fun? Seth's flaw was loving his wife Jan, who kidded herself she didn't want a rich husband. After much careful phrasing and many Freudian slips, she came clean. \"Respect for a partner is bound up in their ability to make money,\" she faltered. Small wonder that Seth, bound to such a partner, lacked the self-respect necessary to get his act together. Jan agreed that she should earn big bucks while Seth raised the child, but then she got resentful and chucked him out. We saw a poignant shot of their hallway, blank spaces where Seth's photos had hung. How did this make Jan feel? \"Not as sad as I thought.\" Little saddens Jan, one suspects, except pay cuts.",

The line up includes Dustin Hoffman, Faye Dunaway, Leslie Nielson, Sydney Pollack, Kate Winslet and Hugh Grant. Each celebrity has a \"person\" to look after them in the wings and eventually push them on to the stage. At which point I do a nod and a smile, step back and let them give the award. </p> <p>There's no time to chat. You don't get to ask Elle Macpherson where she got her dress. You do one short paragraph of \"general film banter\" between envelopes and maybe the odd gag to resurrect someone's past. Which can be difficult. Hugh Grant, for instance. Can't think of anything to drag up about him. </p> <p>Celebrity envelope-openers are notorious for nerves. So it's your job to \"candidly\" remedy hideous but inevitable blunders. Like someone announcing the winner before they've read the nominations. The producer will be shouting down the earpiece, \"The clips! The clips!\". And you'll have to say, \"No, Dustin, let's just have a look at a few clips of the nominations before we hand out the award.\" And celebrities are prone to reading out the wrong names, too.

He added: \"I very much welcome Greg Dyke's taking of an axe to the bureaucracy of the BBC. \"It is something we specifically asked him to do when we set the funding settlement in place for the BBC and I think he has made a very good start in doing that.\" He criticised BBC1 output during spring and summer last year as \"not particularly exciting\", but praised the autumn scheduling as dramatic and added: \"I want to see that as the norm rather than the exception for the BBC.\" A BBC spokesman said: \"Greg Dyke has made it no secret that BBC1 is a main priority for an injection of extra funding as the channel's programme budget had fallen to \u00a3120m below that of ITV. By last summer that deficit had started to show on screen.\" He added that the BBC was determined to present more quality programmes. \"There are no shortage of good ideas deserving investment.\" Mr Smith also called for the restoration of News at Ten on ITV, saying he believed access to \"good quality impartial news\" had been diminished since its demise. Up to 2m fewer people now watch TV news than before News at Ten was axed.",

But, as General de Gaulle once said of the brave man who sought to monopolise the conversation: \"He is somebody, your Bourguiba.\" Bourguiba is survived by his second wife and a son from his first marriage, Habib Jr, a retired diplomat, who had, at one time, served as his father's foreign minister. \u0095 Habib Ben Ali Bourguiba, politician, born August 3 1903; died April 6 2000",

      "bodyText": "The government is deadlocked in its efforts to negotiate a backstairs consensus with the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats on final reform of the House of Lords. It may be forced to impose a unilateral solution after the coming general election. Senior ministers admitted the impasse yesterday as angry Lib Dems warned that they will get even more \"bloody-minded\" in key votes in the upper house if the government tries to take them for granted. Still sore at Tony Blair's refusal to grant them more than nine new peers last week - because they are \"not loyal enough\" - Lib Dem peers say they will not ambush Labour measures without notice, as the Tories do. But they will vote accoprding to their consciences on issues of principle like jury trial, freedom of information and NHS reforms. \"If they expect our good will to continue, they must acknowledge the nature of our independence,\" said one. The impasse means that the cabinet is likely to soft-pedal further change in the half-reformed upper house - where it has suffered 10 defeats this year - and to concede elections for up to 100 of the 665 peers after the election. That would reduce charges of Blairite cronyism. But reports that it will be done within a year of a second Labour victory were dismissed yesterday as premature - even though ministers are rattled by Opposition claims that ejection of all but 923 hereditary peers has made the Lords more \"legitimate\". The \"tundra-like\" relations between Lady Jay, leader of the Lords, and Lords Strathclyde and Rodgers, her Tory and Lib Dem counterparts, comes as ministers try to put out feelers to establish a tripartite consensus on implementation of the Wakeham royal commission report on further reform. Mr Blair is willing to concede either of Lord Wakeham's limited election models, up to 100 peers elected directly or by regional list. But the Lib Dems want a fully-elected house, as do some - but not all - senior Tories, at least while they have little hope of winning power. After complaints about the half-reformed Lords from MPs on all sides yesterday, Margaret Beckett, leader of the Commons, told reporters: \"We have always wanted to proceed by broad consensus, but the attitude of the Opposition has made that improbable.\" Labour still has 32 fewer peers than the Tories, she pointed out. Both sides agree that, with Labour's overwhelming majority in the Commons and no party having a majority in the Lords, the upper house is going to be a crucial battleground on disputed or defective legislation.",

On one side are the countries of the south with increasing elephant herds, which want to trade ivory, hides, meat and trophies; on the other those of the north and west, which rely mainly on the tourist trade. The latter are afraid that the resumption of trading would restore black market prices for ivory and encourage poachers to destroy their herds and their livelihoods. But the argument in Nairobi is not just about elephants. For the next two weeks the 150 countries which have signed the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) meet for the first time in three years to decide which animals, birds and plants to protect, and how to do it. And it is not a simple matter of deciding whether to ban trading in species that are disappearing. Rather, the argument is whether the future of many of the world's favourite animals and plants can be better protected by controlled trading. Twenty years ago there was still a substantial body of opinion that large areas could be fenced off, either literally or legally on paper, where tigers could romp and nature could continue unmolested. In practical terms this often meant not consulting the people who lived in these places, and evicting them from their homes and traditional way of life, without considering that these tribes and animals may have coexisted for centuries. Elephant and tiger were both given fenced-off areas in their home ranges, but both species need a lot of space to forage and hunt, and their needs compete with those of ever increasing human populations which want to plant crops where these animals once freely roamed. Conservationists and some Africa states will argue in Nairobi that unless local people are given an interest in keeping the elephants alive by being allowed to profit from their ivory and eat their meat, then the elephant will come off second best. There is a slightly different approach to whales. The Norwegians argue that the minke is in direct competition with man for fish species which are in short supply, and that they should be culled as a food resource to keep their numbers limited. The same argument applies to Hawksbill turtles. Trade in their shells is banned, but Cuba, which has a well managed population and a tradition of eating turtle meat, much of it now farmed, has a stockpile of shells which it wants to sell to Japanese craftsmen. The argument is that if fishing villages can profit from the sale of shells they will have an interest in protecting wild turtle stocks. Opponents ask how, if trading is allowed, it is possible to tell whether the shell came from a farmed or wild turtle, whether the ivory came from a licensed country or was poached in another state. Those in favour of total bans say that halting official ivory sales brought a dramatic drop in poaching. In the 1990s black market prices collapsed and many poachers turned to other ways of making a living. Cites lists fully protected species in which all international trade is banned in appendix I. Those in which a limited, highly regulated trade is allowed are in appendix II. The southern African states want their elephants listed in appendix II; Kenya wants them in I. A similar battle surrounds whales. Norway and Japan believe that minke in the North Atlantic, Antarctic and parts of the Pacific, currently in appendix I, are now sufficiently numerous to be hunted and eaten under strict quota rules. They want the minke \"downlisted\" to appendix II. Conservationist countries, including Britain and the US, are appalled. Another international body, the International Whaling Commission, controls whale hunting but it is a much smaller organisation, with fewer than 50 member states, and it is in the hands of conservationists, who have blocked the resumption of whaling. Japan and Norway have been accused of using aid money and other political levers, like support for the ivory trade, to get Cites to take over the role of controlling whaling. They deny it. A problem with whales, turtles, elephants, and the basking shark (which Britain wants to protect) is that they do not respect national boundaries. The basking sharks from which Norway cuts the fins to send to Japan for soup are the very fish that attract Japanese tourists to the Isle of Man, where they can be seen sailing past in the clear water.",

      "bodyText": "The Ugandan government yesterday issued six arrest warrants on 10 counts of murder each for the leaders of the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God cult, more than 700 of whose members have died. The warrants are for the cult leader, Joseph Kibwetere, the \"programmer\", Credonia Mwerinde and four of the \"apostles\", Catholic priest Dominic Kataribabo, and three leaders named only as Kasaburai, Kamagara and Komuhangai. \"There are 10 counts [each] for now, but it could be more. The investigations are still going on. This is just to get them arrested,\" the director of public prosecutions, Richard Buteere, said. \"This is a holding charge. If they are arrested, the proper charge shall be preferred.\" It is not clear what prompted the police to issue the arrest warrants, other than the need to appear to be doing something to solve what looks as if it may become the largest cult-related massacre on record. Although the Ugandan police have admitted that the demands of the investigation are beyond their under-resourced capacity, pressure is mounting on the force and government officials to explain how the cult could have gone unchecked for so long. Reports emerged yesterday that, weeks before the doomsday cult's fiery end, top authorities in Kampala sent local police a \"very urgent\" warning that the sect was reported to be kidnapping children and burying those who died in mass graves. Police have denied the existence of the children's graves, but the disclosure follows the arrest of a local government official for covering up a previous security report. Also, in the spring of 1999, officials who were investigating a series of sudden deaths among the cult's children at a compound in Rushojwa called of their inquiry after being told they had died of malaria. The bodies of 725 cult members have been found since the start of an investigation that was at first thought to be mass suicide. At least 330 - and possibly as many as 500 - were killed in a fire on March 17 at the cult headquarters in Kanungu, western Uganda. A further 395 bodies have since been exhumed from four sites operated by the cult in the western Ugandan districts of Rukingere and Bushenyi. Police believe that there are still more bodies in other sites in the area, but they have temporarily halted exhumations because of a lack of funds and expertise. One body, sprawled out by the rear exit of the church in Kanungu, had been identified as that of Father Kataribabo.

      "body": "<p>Where will you go, Joe DiMaggio? That is the question that is currently perplexing his fans and family in a bizarre and unseemly row over a memorial for the legendary baseball star and ex-husband of Marilyn Monroe.</p> <p>The city of San Francisco, where DiMaggio grew up and retired to, is anxious to pay tribute to the man once known as the greatest living baseball player. Plans were made to rename the North Beach playground where \"Joltin' Joe\", who died last year, first learned his elegant skills.</p> <p>Then some of his family intervened to say that they did not feel the playground was a suitable memorial and that Joe deserved something bigger, such as the San Francisco International airport or the Bay Bridge.</p> <p>The family's attorney, Morris Engelberg, even threatened to sue if the city proceeded to rename the park without the family's permission. Mr Engelberg said that, before his death at the age of 84, DiMaggio had indicated that he would have liked his name attached to the airport or the bridge, and Mr Engelberg was thus just doing his late client's bidding.</p> <p>DiMaggio was well known for jealously protecting his name, refusing to sign baseballs if he thought they would be resold on the sport memorabilia market.</p> <p>The family, and the legal intervention, has upset the San Francisco mayor, Willie Brown. If the family did not like the idea of the park, which stands in the old Italian neighbourhood adjoining Chinatown, then there would be no memorial at all. The city supervisor, Gavin Newson, has said that the city will not give in to the demands.</p> <p>Now Joe's brother has entered the arena. Dom DiMaggio, 84, said that the playground would be fine as a tribute to Joe.</p> <p>\"This city has been very good to my family, starting with my immigrant parents and continuing to this day,\" said Dom DiMaggio yesterday. \"As far as I am concerned, the city can determine for itself the way it wants to honour its native son.\"</p> <p>He reckoned that his late brother would have supported the idea of the playground being renamed, particularly if it meant that the now slightly run-down playspace was modernised.</p> <p>At the North Beach playground yesterday, there was clear support for the city's plan. Sitting in his wheelchair outside, Marco Turchino, who had known DiMaggio as a boy, said that a renamed park would be the best memorial.</p> <p>\"This is where he came from,\" said Mr Turchino, a former fisherman who remembered DiMaggio's fisherman father. \"This is where he played. Who's going to go all the way to the airport to see a plaque? He was a helluva good player and this is the place he should be remembered.\"</p> <p>Slinging a cheroot into the gutter, Mr Turchino said that he would like to tell the people who thought the park was unworthy as a memorial to an American sports idol what to do to themselves.</p> <p>The row highlights the delicate business of renaming and honouring; William Hague's suggestion in the wake of Princess Diana's death that Heathrow be renamed comes to mind. But at least Joe's admirers know that, whatever happens, no one is ever going to rewrite what he achieved as a New York Yankee.</p>",

That is the question that is currently perplexing his fans and family in a bizarre and unseemly row over a memorial for the legendary baseball star and ex-husband of Marilyn Monroe. The city of San Francisco, where DiMaggio grew up and retired to, is anxious to pay tribute to the man once known as the greatest living baseball player. Plans were made to rename the North Beach playground where \"Joltin' Joe\", who died last year, first learned his elegant skills. Then some of his family intervened to say that they did not feel the playground was a suitable memorial and that Joe deserved something bigger, such as the San Francisco International airport or the Bay Bridge. The family's attorney, Morris Engelberg, even threatened to sue if the city proceeded to rename the park without the family's permission. Mr Engelberg said that, before his death at the age of 84, DiMaggio had indicated that he would have liked his name attached to the airport or the bridge, and Mr Engelberg was thus just doing his late client's bidding. DiMaggio was well known for jealously protecting his name, refusing to sign baseballs if he thought they would be resold on the sport memorabilia market. The family, and the legal intervention, has upset the San Francisco mayor, Willie Brown. If the family did not like the idea of the park, which stands in the old Italian neighbourhood adjoining Chinatown, then there would be no memorial at all. The city supervisor, Gavin Newson, has said that the city will not give in to the demands. Now Joe's brother has entered the arena. Dom DiMaggio, 84, said that the playground would be fine as a tribute to Joe. \"This city has been very good to my family, starting with my immigrant parents and continuing to this day,\" said Dom DiMaggio yesterday. \"As far as I am concerned, the city can determine for itself the way it wants to honour its native son.\" He reckoned that his late brother would have supported the idea of the playground being renamed, particularly if it meant that the now slightly run-down playspace was modernised. At the North Beach playground yesterday, there was clear support for the city's plan. Sitting in his wheelchair outside, Marco Turchino, who had known DiMaggio as a boy, said that a renamed park would be the best memorial. \"This is where he came from,\" said Mr Turchino, a former fisherman who remembered DiMaggio's fisherman father. \"This is where he played. Who's going to go all the way to the airport to see a plaque? He was a helluva good player and this is the place he should be remembered.\" Slinging a cheroot into the gutter, Mr Turchino said that he would like to tell the people who thought the park was unworthy as a memorial to an American sports idol what to do to themselves. The row highlights the delicate business of renaming and honouring; William Hague's suggestion in the wake of Princess Diana's death that Heathrow be renamed comes to mind. But at least Joe's admirers know that, whatever happens, no one is ever going to rewrite what he achieved as a New York Yankee.",

The point of adult baptism is belief. It is an affront to any religion (or any secular society) to go through a ceremony without any belief or intention of carrying out one's promises.</p> <p>Enquirers - those who want to know about Catholic belief or wish to be baptised - are now asked to participate in a befriending group; only after weeks of discussion and coming to some understanding of Catholic teaching would a candidate be thought ready for baptism.</p> <p>Name and address supplied</p> <p><b> He needs help, not you</b><br></p> <p>I am the daughter of parents in their 80s, one of whom has lately returned to the Anglican church of which I am a member, the other of whom is an avowed atheist. In my professional life I have experience of elderly people who, facing their mortality, renew their faith but have misgivings about past omissions. Your father has a medical condition which may affect the flow of oxygen to his brain and confuse his thought processes. Moreover, you are only 30, born when he was over 50, and he may still perceive you as a child rather than an independent adult.</p> <p>Whatever your personal views and your father's past experiences, he clearly needs the support of a caring church. Encourage your father to seek counselling from his priest. If he does not have one, with your father's permission, contact the local priest and ask him to visit your father. This is something you could do for him whether you believe or not.</p> <p>You might consider suggesting to your father that, together, you see a priest he knows and trusts, so that you can explain your point of view that, as a grown woman, it is not his, but your decision whether or not to be baptised. If your father continues to dwell on his guilt (which, with his medical condition, he may) you and his priest may have to continue to reassure him that it is not his problem.</p> <p>Name and address supplied</p> <p><b> You're in good company</b><br></p> <p>Stick to your beliefs and point this out to your father: Myra Hindley, the murderous cult leaders in Nigeria and Hitler all had parents who ensured they were christened in the Catholic faith. Socrates and Mahatma Gandhi did not. Which ones, in his opinion, are more likely to end up in hell?</p> <p>If he is still not convinced, ask a Catholic priest to pay him a visit and reassure him that if you are condemned to hell, it will be because of your own sins, and not because of someone else's omission.</p> <p>Claude Shields, Aylesbury</p> <p><b> Take the plunge</b><br></p> <p>Writing as somebody who strongly objects to all things religious I would advise you to do as your father wishes. If you really are a non-believer, going through the ceremony of baptism would be a meaningless ritual for you. All you have to provide is a small amount of your time. Why do you hesitate? This view is based on the fact that your father has not got much longer to live. If you were much younger, the need to assert your own views and values might, of course, be a necessary part of developing an adult relationship with your parent.</p> <p>If, on the other hand, you suspect that you might be committing yourself to something that has a meaning for you, the situation is different. In this case, your own peace of mind is probably more important than that of your father - and remember, you are likely to have to live with your decision for longer.</p> <p>Anke Neibig, Newcastle- upon-Tyne</p> <p><b>Next week</b></p> <p>I am currently in a loving and mutually supportive relationship with a man who has a history of infidelity. It began before his separation from his second wife. He is some years older than me and it seems to me that much of the explanation for his philandering was due to a different generational approach to remaining in a marriage no matter how unhappy it was.</p> <p>However, whatever the reasons for his constant infidelity I now find myself becoming increasingly distrustful of him. He knows that I suffer with insecurity in sexual relationships and tries to reassure me, but I can't help feeling that I am a fool to believe that after a lifetime of profligacy he can commit himself to a monogamous relationship. Despite this, in all other areas of life he is an honourable and compassionate human being who is respected and admired.</p> <p>I strongly believe that people have the capacity to change but I can't seem to apply this view to him. I have now reached the stage where I am starting to question him about his activities and I brood on the situation in self-destructive ways.</p> <p>Is it possible to trust someone with such a history?

      "bodyText": "My father, who is in his 80s and suffering from emphysema, was brought up as a Catholic. His schooling in a monastery put him off setting foot in a church for 50 years. However, as his health has deteriorated he has returned to his Catholic roots. He prays every day, and has become agitated over not having had me baptised. He is terrified he may have condemned me to hell, and is desperate for me to be christened. I am a 30-year-old woman, who not only finds it impossible to believe in any institutionalised god, but is also repelled by many of the things the Catholic church has done and stands for. Should I stick to my beliefs or go through with this to make an old, sick man happy? It's a mockery of faith Anyone who returned to their \"Catholic roots\" and talked to a priest would soon be told that we don't believe that the unbaptised go to hell. An adult can't just go and get sprinkled with the waters of baptism like a wash and blow-dry. The point of adult baptism is belief. It is an affront to any religion (or any secular society) to go through a ceremony without any belief or intention of carrying out one's promises. Enquirers - those who want to know about Catholic belief or wish to be baptised - are now asked to participate in a befriending group; only after weeks of discussion and coming to some understanding of Catholic teaching would a candidate be thought ready for baptism. Name and address supplied He needs help, not you I am the daughter of parents in their 80s, one of whom has lately returned to the Anglican church of which I am a member, the other of whom is an avowed atheist. In my professional life I have experience of elderly people who, facing their mortality, renew their faith but have misgivings about past omissions. Your father has a medical condition which may affect the flow of oxygen to his brain and confuse his thought processes. Moreover, you are only 30, born when he was over 50, and he may still perceive you as a child rather than an independent adult. Whatever your personal views and your father's past experiences, he clearly needs the support of a caring church. Encourage your father to seek counselling from his priest. If he does not have one, with your father's permission, contact the local priest and ask him to visit your father. This is something you could do for him whether you believe or not. You might consider suggesting to your father that, together, you see a priest he knows and trusts, so that you can explain your point of view that, as a grown woman, it is not his, but your decision whether or not to be baptised. If your father continues to dwell on his guilt (which, with his medical condition, he may) you and his priest may have to continue to reassure him that it is not his problem. Name and address supplied You're in good company Stick to your beliefs and point this out to your father: Myra Hindley, the murderous cult leaders in Nigeria and Hitler all had parents who ensured they were christened in the Catholic faith. Socrates and Mahatma Gandhi did not. Which ones, in his opinion, are more likely to end up in hell? If he is still not convinced, ask a Catholic priest to pay him a visit and reassure him that if you are condemned to hell, it will be because of your own sins, and not because of someone else's omission. Claude Shields, Aylesbury Take the plunge Writing as somebody who strongly objects to all things religious I would advise you to do as your father wishes. If you really are a non-believer, going through the ceremony of baptism would be a meaningless ritual for you. All you have to provide is a small amount of your time. Why do you hesitate? This view is based on the fact that your father has not got much longer to live. If you were much younger, the need to assert your own views and values might, of course, be a necessary part of developing an adult relationship with your parent. If, on the other hand, you suspect that you might be committing yourself to something that has a meaning for you, the situation is different. In this case, your own peace of mind is probably more important than that of your father - and remember, you are likely to have to live with your decision for longer. Anke Neibig, Newcastle- upon-Tyne Next week I am currently in a loving and mutually supportive relationship with a man who has a history of infidelity. It began before his separation from his second wife. He is some years older than me and it seems to me that much of the explanation for his philandering was due to a different generational approach to remaining in a marriage no matter how unhappy it was. However, whatever the reasons for his constant infidelity I now find myself becoming increasingly distrustful of him. He knows that I suffer with insecurity in sexual relationships and tries to reassure me, but I can't help feeling that I am a fool to believe that after a lifetime of profligacy he can commit himself to a monogamous relationship. Despite this, in all other areas of life he is an honourable and compassionate human being who is respected and admired. I strongly believe that people have the capacity to change but I can't seem to apply this view to him. I have now reached the stage where I am starting to question him about his activities and I brood on the situation in self-destructive ways. Is it possible to trust someone with such a history? If so, how? Each Friday we publish a letter to which readers are invited to respond. Replies, giving an account of your personal experience, should reach us by Thursday.

Apart from the heat, how did they put up with the noise, stench and filth? We had already wondered at the horrors of the assembly line, shaking our heads in sympathy with the men carrying out their repetitive tasks, hour after hour, day after day. For many of us, boys and girls from Dagenham county high school on an obligatory trip around the Ford factory in the early 1960s, it was a turning point.</p> <p>Our teachers had often told us that we, the offspring of largely blue-collar workers, were \"privileged\" because we were enjoying the benefits of a grammar school education. It didn't mean much until we went to Ford. I have long suspected that we all made a silent vow that day: whatever happens, we will not work here.</p> <p>Now, 40 years later, it is Ford making the vow: there will be no work here at all if profits continue to slide. Ford of Europe chairman Nick Scheele announced in late February: \"I can't guarantee the Dagenham plant won't shut.\" That threat may only be a bargaining ploy to cow the unions as the company seeks to cut more than 3,000 jobs from the existing 8,000. Or could it be, as the Barking and Dagenham Post suggested, the end of the line, the start to a process heralding the inevitable closure of one of Britain's most famous manufacturing landmarks?</p> <p>Whatever the outcome, the short-term future of Dagenham is in the balance. In the long term, as we undergo a hi-tech revolution while global capitalism continues to demand the relocation of engineering companies to countries where labour is cheaper, it looks decidedly dodgy.</p> <p>As I drive through the familiar streets of the giant Becontree estate on my first visit for almost a decade, I wonder what the future holds for Dagenham. Outsiders may well answer: who cares? I concede that it isn't the kind of place to inspire affection. It's an aesthete's vision of hell. But Dagenham has a special place in my memories and, yes, in my heart. I went to school there for six years and spent the best part of the next four as a junior journalist on one of the local newspapers. I was not \"from\" Dagenham but I consider I am \"of\" Dagenham. It is my adopted home town.</p> <p>When Tony Blair pointed out, in a recent speech on Britishness, that we are a geographically mobile people who are rarely \"from\" one place, I understood what he meant. Born in Dulwich, south-east London, I moved to Walthamstow when I was six and, by the time I was seven, we were living in a council house on an estate near South Ockendon, Essex. After passing the 11-plus, I was sent to Dagenham county high, a grammar school in the poorest of Essex boroughs for the poorest of academic performers.</p> <p>Against the odds, and to my mother's chagrin, I enjoyed Dagenham, with its vibrant street life and edgy atmosphere. I was 14 when my parents bought a house in the more upmarket area of Leigh-on-Sea, but I refused to switch schools, happily enduring the daily 50-mile round trip to Dagenham. It was indeed a grim area, but I soon discovered that the people were far nicer than the surroundings. Gangs of teddy boys with razor blades tucked into the lapels of their velvet-collared jackets were a media myth. Their clothes were always sharper than their knives.</p> <p>I found myself nestling in the warmth of my schoolfriends' parents, almost all of them part of the east end diaspora dislodged by the Blitz. These people, like my own parents, were eager for their sons and daughters to succeed, to escape from the drudgery they and their parents before them had endured. They recognised that education was the door to a world of opportunity opening up for the baby boom generation of the early 1960s.</p> <p>Ford, where a lot of my friends' fathers worked, seemed like a step backwards. The insistent message of our youth was not to do as our dads had done. We must \"better\" ourselves: wear white collars, avoid manual work, get a life. A father of one of my friends, a Ford foundryman for 20 years, once told me: \"It's awful. I hate it.\" He was determined that his son wouldn't enter Ford's gates.</p> <p>Some 15 years later, when I hunted down my 128 former co-pupils, I found that only three had taken jobs at Ford, all white-collar, and none of them at Dagenham. We, the brightest of the local kids, had turned our backs on the company that symbolised our area. Thousands of others didn't, and there are plenty of families in Dagenham now that boast three generations of Ford employees.</p> <p>Only later did I come to realise that there was nothing intrinsically wrong with Ford, with any manufacturing industry. We had been conditioned by a mixture of snobbishness and a mistaken belief that factories of any kind represented the past.</p> <p>Perhaps that's why so many of us left Dagenham behind. As I stand outside my old school, I recall that only a handful of us were living in the borough 10 years after leaving school. Moving on meant moving up. Many have never looked back, glad to put the place behind them and to subscribe to the myths that have taken hold of the public imagination.</p> <p>Myth one: Dagenham exists because of Ford. In fact, the building of the estate that dominates Dagenham happened simultaneously with the siting of Ford's plant. But the planning of the 27,000 houses in the 1920s for a population of almost 100,000 - making it the world's largest state housing scheme - happened well before Henry Ford selected the riverside marshes for his first British factory in 1929.</p> <p>Myth two: Dagenham's economy depends on Ford. It never has. For many years, more men worked in the docks than at Ford. It is thought that only about 10% of the current workforce, some 800 people, live within the borough of Barking &amp; Dagenham.</p> <p>Myth three: Dagenham would die if Ford closed. It might suffer for a while, but it would survive and may even, as we shall see, go on to thrive.</p> <p>There is no denying, however, that Ford put Dagenham on the map. After all, Ford is not just a run-of-the-mill multinational. It is a global superbrand, an icon of capitalism. Talk of Dagenham to anyone anywhere and you can be sure they will mention Ford. Despite its American roots, its Detroit headquarters, its far-flung European presence and its large plant in Liverpool, Ford of Dagenham has a peculiar place in the British imagination. In its Essex heartland, it is embedded in the culture.</p> <p>Had a love affair with Nina,</p> <p>In the back of my Cortina.</p> <p>Ian Dury, raised in nearby Upminster, understood the affection for the \"local\" car which has enjoyed so many manifestations: the robust Consul, the functional Anglia, the racy Capri, the scintillating Zephyr. All these and more have been produced at the plant.</p> <p>While reporting for the Barking &amp; Dagenham Advertiser I drove a Popular, available for \u00a3100 when first made in 1935. Later I had a Cortina and a Granada. \"You knew what you were getting with a Ford,\" says my old friend Alf Groves. \"They were cheap but you got great value.\" After 34 years at Ford, rising from \u00a37-a-week shipping clerk to \u00a315,300-a-year export supervisor, he has been retired for 15 years but still drives a Ford. As an ex-employee he received an 18.5% discount on his Mondeo. Alf, who lives in Barking, is one of about eight former Ford employees in his street. At one time, half the local councillors worked at the plant.</p> <p>A plant? It's a city of 1.7 square miles, an unlovely monument to 20th-century manufacturing industry, now seemingly an anachronism in a dot.com world. Steam escapes from a variety of flues and chimneys. Functional buildings looped by giant pipes rise from a higgledy-piggledy landscape dotted with tanks, prefabricated offices and pylons.</p> <p>The spaces between are wastelands of rusting girders, odd bits of discarded machinery, the decaying detritus of so many engineering sites. No wonder Ford, in a belated attempt to clean up its act, has recently planted 2,500 trees, including what it hopes will eventually be a waterside forest.</p> <p>My photographer, on his first visit to Dagenham and, I imagine, his last, openly gasped at the filth of the public roads that run past the plant. He was also amazed by the mean streets with their terraced houses, once impossible to tell apart, now a riot of cladding, inappropriate bay windows and glass porches.</p> <p>Why, he wondered, would anyone buy such houses in such a place? One answer is money: Dagenham has the lowest average household income in London (\u00a319,569 to Kensington's \u00a333,492) and the cheapest housing, with an average price of just \u00a368,500. They have little choice.</p> <p>But that doesn't explain why new generations are staying on. I suspect from my conversations with residents that the real reason Dagenham has a settled population is that many people like it. Without wishing to indulge in false romanticism, it is a kind of transplanted, pre-war east end of London. What has developed in Dagenham is a quasi-cockney community, a recreation of the Poplar, Stepney and Limehouse roots from which so many residents sprang and which has also influenced the offspring of the estate's original intake from Manchester.</p> <p>Myth-makers like to cast the old east end as some kind of paradise. It wasn't, and neither is Dagenham. But just as the moral core of the east end resided in the people rather than the buildings and streets, so it does in Dagenham. This was my unconscious discovery as a boy and it has taken me almost 40 years of a love-hate relationship to rediscover it.</p> <p>That's why, even if Ford does drive off into the sunset, Dagenham will not suffer as Flint in Michigan did when General Motors deserted in favour of Mexico. In any case, council leader Charlie Fairbrass is convinced that Ford is staying for the moment. He has also been assured that the company will invest in a \u00a3468m project to regenerate part of the ugly Thameside area into a Canary Wharf-style business zone. Stylish new housing is already springing up nearby.</p> <p>But Fairbrass's main aim has been to improve the borough's educational standards, and there is no doubt that there has been a major transformation since five years ago, when it had one of Britain's worst records for exam passes. Fairbrass beams as he tells how Barking and Dagenham last year outstripped the rest of the country with its pass rate improvement. \"We're breeding homegrown talent now,\" he says.</p> <p>That kind of confidence, despite the psychological blow if Ford were to pull out, is heartening. I get the feeling that Dagenham has turned a corner and I'm proud to be one of its sons.</p>",

The other, Brother, is a modern story of mafia hitmen, grimy apartments and what it takes to survive in the chaos of a country that has lost its way. Of Freaks and Men - all about power and perversion - is an arthouse movie while Brother is stylish and violent, and was a huge commercial success in Russia. </p> <p>You would think from Brother - released here today - that Balabanov is trying to make Die Hard in St Petersburg, and claw back some box-office share from Hollywood.

Brother is a film they could relate to. </p> <p>Of Freaks and Men, on the other hand, with its prolonged scenes of a nice middle-class girl being whipped and a blind aristocrat raising her skirts while Siamese conjoined Mongolian twins sing folk songs, is unlikely to get an audience to its feet, except, perhaps, to walk out in disgust. There are, none the less, similarities. Both films share a St Petersburg setting, are photographed with grace by Sergei Astakhov, and give full rein to Viktor Sukhorukov's artlessly charming supporting roles as a psychopath. And both have ruffled audiences' sense of political correctness and good taste. </p> <p>Balabanov admits to making films which provoke: \"When I started making films, it was possible to do anything you wanted.\" He is part of the first generation not limited by censorship. </p> <p>By the time his first film, Happy Days, based on Samuel Beckett, was released in 1992, the old certainties of 70 years of Russian film-making had been swept away. Free to make whatever they liked some, like Nikita Mikhalkov, readily adapted to the new climate while others, including Balabanov's mentor, Alexei German, struggled. All of them were faced for the first time with having to compete with the Hollywood blockbusters which in the early 1990s crowded Russian films out of cinemas across the country. </p> <p>Balabanov's second film - The Castle, an adaptation of Kafka - made the rounds of film festivals while Balabanov wrote the script for Of Freaks and Men. \"I had a very good script, but a film about the 19th century was very expensive to make. So I decided to make a low-budget film. I did not care what film, so I decided to write Brother,\" Balabanov explains laconically. \"Some find Brother immoral, some find it moral, but I don't actually care,\" he adds. </p> <p>In Russia, Brother created the same kind of shock waves as Natural Born Killers did in the west. \"It is imbued with destruction,\" Nikita Mikhalkov commented. \"You should understand where, when and why you make a film about the discreet charm of murder.\" Balabanov's mentor, Alexei German, disowned his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, accusing him of sharing Danila's anti-semitic, xenophobic views, while the press saw its phenomenal success as a reflection of young Russians' disaffection with their country after the disastrous first Chechen war. </p> <p>\"It is the same syndrome as in the United States after Vietnam ,\" says Balabanov. \"I don't worry about being criticised for the attitudes to Chechens and Jews that Danila shows in my films. It is true. He says things which people of his generation think and say. Why should I not say it in my films? I don't care. People in cinemas applaud and critics criticise.\" </p> <p>Foreign viewers admire the film's dark humour, its low-budget stylishness and the naturalness of Sergei Bodrov's portrayal of Danila, who embodies all the contradictions of contemporary Russia. For Balabanov, the most important thing was that Brother, made on a budget of $200,000 and shot on location in the apartments of Balabanov's friends, gave him enough money to finance his next film, Of Freaks and Men, a project much closer to Balabanov's heart. </p> <p>\"I am more interested in looking at the past than at the present. I like the aesthetic of the time,\" he explains. Of Freaks and Men lingers lovingly on 19th-century St Petersburg, its strangeness and its apparently comfortable bourgeois life. </p> <p>But despite the samovars and pianos, this is definitely not Chekhov; Balabanov portrays how a pornographer, Johann - another cool criminal - and his sidekick, played with devilish charm by Viktor Sukhorukov, inveigle their way into two households and force the young women to pose for their photographic sessions. </p> <p>Like Brother, Balabanov gets too close for comfort to the pair's horrible trade. The distancing is done through highly stylised use of sepia tints and silent-film caption boards, but the camera endlessly forces us to watch Liza and Ekaterina's humiliation. </p> <p>Of Freaks and Men's sub-plot revolves around the use of photography and, as the film progresses, of moving pictures. \"I'm a 19th-century film-maker, I would like to live in that period,\" the director explains. So is it his intention to conspire with Johann to make the audience enjoy what they are watching? Balabanov dodges the question. \"It is possible,\" he says. \"You watch the film, you decide.\" </p> <p>To audiences brought up with notions of Chekhovian characters pondering their fate, Of Freaks and Men seems a deliberate attempt to overturn the myths of pre-revolutionary Russia, which Soviet film created. Again Balabanov has a ready defence. \"I love this time very much. This part of life existed, but it never appeared in films. It is shown in the photographs of the time and I wanted to make a film about it. It existed and what is wrong about it?\" </p> <p>Balabanov cites Feodor Sologub, Russia's best-known \"decadent\" writer whose works were ignored in prudish Soviet times, and it is hard to argue against him. But the uneasiness remains. Whereas his predecessors would have critiqued characters like Danila and Johann, Balabanov seems to be half in love with them. In Brother violence is simply necessary to survive, while in Of Freaks and Men perversion and blackmail are seen as powerfully attractive. </p> <p>It would be easy to dismiss Balabanov's work as morally repellent, yet both films contain elements of truth. Danila represents attitudes you can find on any Russian streetcorner, and there was more to the pre-revolutionary bourgeoisie than Soviet film-makers ever showed. </p> <p>Balabanov can take pride in being one of the few Russian directors who can survive without turning to commercials and pop videos to make a living. He has managed to get Russian audiences interested in seeing Russian films again. He is busy in his St Petersburg studio finishing the sequel to Brother, in which Danila goes to the US to settle scores, and he is already planning the shooting of his next film, about a 19th century ethnographer.

      "body": "<p>The first man on Mars is marooned when his landing party is zapped in a mysterious dust storm. In response to a garbled SOS, a rescue mission that includes a husband-and-wife team is dispatched to save our hero. Such is the premise for Disney's impending epic space-capade, Mission to Mars. It is also, as it happens, the set-up for a 1958 B picture called It! The Terror From Beyond Space. </p> <p>Expect further recycling: more missions to our neighbouring orb are on the launch pad. Warners' The Red Planet (starring Val Kilmer) follows this summer, and next year there is a James Cameron Imax 3D project and a TV mini-series. Two other features - Mars and Beyond, and John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars - are also in production. </p> <p>Ever since Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s blasted his Rocket to the Moon in 1902, movies have been concerned with the question of (to quote Ming the Merciless) \"hurling our bodies into the void\". This according to Tom Jacobson, the on-the-defensive producer of Mission to Mars, is \"because it's the next frontier. It's why the western was so popular. It represents the best, the most heroic and the most challenging in human nature.\" </p> <p>It comes as a blessed relief that, after a cluster of asteroid movies (Armageddon; Deep Impact), film-makers are touching down again on that forgotten favourite, the Red Planet - once Earth's greatest bogey, but last glimpsed as an uninspiring mining colony preoccupying Arnold Schwarzenegger in Total Recall. </p> <p>At one time Mars was the only place a self-respecting alien would lay his slimy hat (spoofed so marvellously by Tim Burton in Mars Attacks!). So much so that \"Martian\" and \"alien\" were virtually interchangeable: the \"little green men\" gleefully levelling our capital cities throughout the 50s as prelude to invasion. \"Across the gulf of space on the planet Mars, intellects vast and cold and unsympathetic regarded our Earth with envious eyes, slowly and surely drawing their plans against us,\" warned the narrator of 1953's War of the Worlds. </p> <p>From 1951's Flying Disc Men from Mars, Invaders from Mars (1953), Conquest of Space (1954) and The Angry Red Planet (1959) to our own Quatermass and the Pit (1967), scores of films have been devoted to our space nemesis. Being red and all, Mars was also conveniently emblematic of communism. Nowhere is this more evident than in Red Planet Mars, in which, after receiving cryptic broadcast messages from our closest rock, Jehovah himself addresses Earth over the radio (\"You have denied God's words and worshipped false gods\"), precipitating the collapse of the atheistic USSR. </p> <p>It's a shame that as science-fiction got tinged with science-fact - not to mention increased audience sophistication - Mars drifted out of orbit and was treated more as an object of exotica, with films such as Santa Claus Conquers the Martians (1964), and Mars Needs Women (1968). By the time Mars returned, in 1978, it had become less a place of awe than the unwitting party in a clever paranoid thriller, Capricorn One - itself a response to rumours that the first moon landing was staged in a TV studio. </p> <p>So why the renewed Martian mania? The big difference between now and, say, Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars in 1938 - when Buster Crabbe saved humanity from destruction by nitrogen-destroying lamp, and all the Martians spoke English - is that we have reasonable expectations of what we'll find when we get there. Which is why the makers of Mission to Mars secured the expertise of Nasa and consultant astronaut Story Musgrave (a Nasa veteran of 30 years with six spaceflights under his utility belt) to ensure verisimilitude. Every piece of hardware and the human habitats, we are assured, has been faithfully replicated from designs sitting on mission control's drawing-board. Nasa even had script approval. </p> <p>\"The film is very close to a trajectory that may exist in 2020, which is when Mission to Mars is set, but it's important to realise that it's not a documentary,\" Musgrave stresses. \"The movie has, by nature, to create the reality.\" </p> <p>In fact, there is something to pin it all on. The latest fleet of projects tracks its blast-off back to the \"Martian meteorite\" discovery and the 1997 Pathfinder mission which, as a ready-made marketing tool for Hollywood, secured 700m hits on its website. The additional publicity of recent Nasa exploits (despite the Polar Lander and Mars Climate Orbiter mishaps) certainly won't have hurt. </p> <p>Though Nasa steps back from endorsing the movie (\"We call it 'participating' in the making of the film,\" says Nasa spokeswoman Bobbie Faye Ferguson), the agency's logos, or \"meatballs\" as they are descriptively dubbed, adorn the spacesuits and all the equipment in the film - as they will in Clint Eastwood's forthcoming Space Cowboys, another movie made with Nasa's blessing. </p> <p>\"We had no financial interest in the making of that movie or any movie,\" Ferguson asserts of Mission to Mars. \"Federal agencies cannot do that.\" But there's still plenty to gain. With its \"faster, cheaper, better\" robotic odysseys failing to capture public imagination in the way the flag-waving Apollo missions did, Nasa needs to raise its profile. A manned Mars mission would cost $55bn - around the same price as last year's Kosovo operation. </p> <p>\"One of the things we do is try to increase awareness of space and spatial exploration,\" says Ferguson. \"Right now there is a lot of interest in a manned mission to Mars. There is no official manned mission listed, but that's not saying there's not a lot of people who aren't very excited about it. I certainly think that participating in films that reach a large number of people, and that are feasibly fictional, increases the awareness of space and the future.\" </p> <p>James Cameron has made no bones about it, enlisting to his painstakingly researched projects Robert Zubrin, author of the bestseller The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must. \"I want to make humans- to-Mars real in the minds of the viewing public,\" Cameron said at the second annual conference of the Mars Society, a think-tank advocating manned exploration. </p> <p>It cuts both ways. While the scientific community will only begrudgingly acknowledge it, Hollywood has supplied more than a few ideas of its own over the years, beyond bequeathing the name Star Wars to Reagan's satellite missile system. Indeed, those charged with the practicalities of Mars travel could do worse than watch Robert Altman's Countdown, which got James Caan safely to the moon a year before Neil Armstrong (\"Try begging for some of that Hollywood money. They've been making money off of aliens for years,\" says Jodie Foster's astronomer in Contact as she tries to raise capital for a space-monitoring project). </p> <p>In 1991 Vivian Sobchack, film studies professor at UCLA and author of Screening Space: The American Science-Fiction Film, was co-opted on to a body called the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (Seti). Seti works with Nasa in formulating how to break the news to the general public if and when alien contact is made. \"Ultimately,\" says Sobchack, \"one of the things on the agenda of Nasa and Seti was to have closer relations with the movie industry so we'd at least be closer in accuracy when conveying certain kinds of things.\" </p> <p>Conspiracy theorists go one further. Why, they ask, after years of vehemently denying the existence of the \"face\" on Mars - the mysterious rock formation dismissed as tricks of shadows and light - has Nasa given its backing to a film in which said face, albeit in absurd fashion, is the central issue? It is suggested that by allowing certain ideas to seep into factually based fiction, the public will become primed to accept whatever Nasa eventually reveals as fact, thus avoiding Orson Welles's radio broadcast-style panic. </p> <p>\"That's been our story for 50 years here - the fact that they put out disinformation and so forth,\" says Carol Syska, director of the International UFO Museum and Research Centre at Roswell, New Mexico. \"They're very good at that.\" </p> <p>Nasa denies anything so sinister. \"We at Nasa do not tell people how to make their movies,\" states Ferguson. \"A movie is fiction. This is not a documentary. It's fiction. It's a movie. Period.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Mission to Mars opens next Friday.</p>",

So much so that \"Martian\" and \"alien\" were virtually interchangeable: the \"little green men\" gleefully levelling our capital cities throughout the 50s as prelude to invasion. \"Across the gulf of space on the planet Mars, intellects vast and cold and unsympathetic regarded our Earth with envious eyes, slowly and surely drawing their plans against us,\" warned the narrator of 1953's War of the Worlds. From 1951's Flying Disc Men from Mars, Invaders from Mars (1953), Conquest of Space (1954) and The Angry Red Planet (1959) to our own Quatermass and the Pit (1967), scores of films have been devoted to our space nemesis. Being red and all, Mars was also conveniently emblematic of communism. Nowhere is this more evident than in Red Planet Mars, in which, after receiving cryptic broadcast messages from our closest rock, Jehovah himself addresses Earth over the radio (\"You have denied God's words and worshipped false gods\"), precipitating the collapse of the atheistic USSR. It's a shame that as science-fiction got tinged with science-fact - not to mention increased audience sophistication - Mars drifted out of orbit and was treated more as an object of exotica, with films such as Santa Claus Conquers the Martians (1964), and Mars Needs Women (1968). By the time Mars returned, in 1978, it had become less a place of awe than the unwitting party in a clever paranoid thriller, Capricorn One - itself a response to rumours that the first moon landing was staged in a TV studio. So why the renewed Martian mania? The big difference between now and, say, Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars in 1938 - when Buster Crabbe saved humanity from destruction by nitrogen-destroying lamp, and all the Martians spoke English - is that we have reasonable expectations of what we'll find when we get there. Which is why the makers of Mission to Mars secured the expertise of Nasa and consultant astronaut Story Musgrave (a Nasa veteran of 30 years with six spaceflights under his utility belt) to ensure verisimilitude. Every piece of hardware and the human habitats, we are assured, has been faithfully replicated from designs sitting on mission control's drawing-board. Nasa even had script approval. \"The film is very close to a trajectory that may exist in 2020, which is when Mission to Mars is set, but it's important to realise that it's not a documentary,\" Musgrave stresses. \"The movie has, by nature, to create the reality.\" In fact, there is something to pin it all on. The latest fleet of projects tracks its blast-off back to the \"Martian meteorite\" discovery and the 1997 Pathfinder mission which, as a ready-made marketing tool for Hollywood, secured 700m hits on its website. The additional publicity of recent Nasa exploits (despite the Polar Lander and Mars Climate Orbiter mishaps) certainly won't have hurt. Though Nasa steps back from endorsing the movie (\"We call it 'participating' in the making of the film,\" says Nasa spokeswoman Bobbie Faye Ferguson), the agency's logos, or \"meatballs\" as they are descriptively dubbed, adorn the spacesuits and all the equipment in the film - as they will in Clint Eastwood's forthcoming Space Cowboys, another movie made with Nasa's blessing. \"We had no financial interest in the making of that movie or any movie,\" Ferguson asserts of Mission to Mars. \"Federal agencies cannot do that.\" But there's still plenty to gain. With its \"faster, cheaper, better\" robotic odysseys failing to capture public imagination in the way the flag-waving Apollo missions did, Nasa needs to raise its profile. A manned Mars mission would cost $55bn - around the same price as last year's Kosovo operation. \"One of the things we do is try to increase awareness of space and spatial exploration,\" says Ferguson. \"Right now there is a lot of interest in a manned mission to Mars. There is no official manned mission listed, but that's not saying there's not a lot of people who aren't very excited about it. I certainly think that participating in films that reach a large number of people, and that are feasibly fictional, increases the awareness of space and the future.\" James Cameron has made no bones about it, enlisting to his painstakingly researched projects Robert Zubrin, author of the bestseller The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must. \"I want to make humans- to-Mars real in the minds of the viewing public,\" Cameron said at the second annual conference of the Mars Society, a think-tank advocating manned exploration. It cuts both ways. While the scientific community will only begrudgingly acknowledge it, Hollywood has supplied more than a few ideas of its own over the years, beyond bequeathing the name Star Wars to Reagan's satellite missile system. Indeed, those charged with the practicalities of Mars travel could do worse than watch Robert Altman's Countdown, which got James Caan safely to the moon a year before Neil Armstrong (\"Try begging for some of that Hollywood money. They've been making money off of aliens for years,\" says Jodie Foster's astronomer in Contact as she tries to raise capital for a space-monitoring project). In 1991 Vivian Sobchack, film studies professor at UCLA and author of Screening Space: The American Science-Fiction Film, was co-opted on to a body called the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (Seti). Seti works with Nasa in formulating how to break the news to the general public if and when alien contact is made. \"Ultimately,\" says Sobchack, \"one of the things on the agenda of Nasa and Seti was to have closer relations with the movie industry so we'd at least be closer in accuracy when conveying certain kinds of things.\" Conspiracy theorists go one further. Why, they ask, after years of vehemently denying the existence of the \"face\" on Mars - the mysterious rock formation dismissed as tricks of shadows and light - has Nasa given its backing to a film in which said face, albeit in absurd fashion, is the central issue? It is suggested that by allowing certain ideas to seep into factually based fiction, the public will become primed to accept whatever Nasa eventually reveals as fact, thus avoiding Orson Welles's radio broadcast-style panic. \"That's been our story for 50 years here - the fact that they put out disinformation and so forth,\" says Carol Syska, director of the International UFO Museum and Research Centre at Roswell, New Mexico. \"They're very good at that.\" Nasa denies anything so sinister. \"We at Nasa do not tell people how to make their movies,\" states Ferguson. \"A movie is fiction. This is not a documentary. It's fiction. It's a movie. Period.\" \u0095 Mission to Mars opens next Friday.",

Kubrick's movie is faithful to the book's plot but stretches it out by making everybody talk very, very slowly with long pauses. I think the aim is to make it seem dreamlike but it just seems somnambulistic and stilted beyond belief.

Curiously, the casting coup of having a married couple in the lead roles is nullified because they never seem like a real couple. With all these factors against it, there's little doubt that, sadly, Kubrick's last film is also his least impressive, taking place in a curious upper-class Neverland that looks like something from a Ferrero Rocher commercial.

Apart from a brief moment of fame three years ago, when it supplied \u00a3350-a-roll Pugin prints for the Lord Chancellor's opulent apartments, it has scarcely pricked the public consciousness. </p> <p>However, behind the scenes, the company has played host to a quite extraordinary drama of power, loathing, money and ambition. The City is furious with the group, having watched its shares collapse from 105p to 36p over the last five years. </p> <p>One of the few analysts still prepared to follow the company remarks: \"If management schools ever want a case study of how not to run a business, this is it.\" </p> <p>Even City financiers accustomed to hostile bids were startled by the slanging match last week when former chief executive Charles Wightman declared he was considering launching a \u00a330m offer for Walker Greenbank. </p> <p>The company's boss, Aidan Connolly, denounced him as \"an obsessive\" and \"an amateur investor\", saying: \"He should put up or shut up - is disruptive tactics are costing shareholders money.\" </p> <p>Mr Wightman's responded: \"With the strategy they're following at the moment they might as well take all the money and pour it out of the window.\" </p> <p>This is far from a one off - Mr Wightman has threatened three times to bid for the company, then backed down after a brief but ferocious exchange of insults. </p> <p>The roots of the dispute go back to 1998, when Mr Wightman presided over the \u00a370m sale of Walker Greenbank's commercial wallcoverings business - an unsexy operation supplying decorations for offices, airports and hotels. </p> <p>After the disposal Mr Wightman stepped down with two other directors, taking away a combined payoff of \u00a32.9m. In fact, Wightman had been acrimoniously ousted after a boardroom row.

      "bodyText": "Lurking in a corner of a Hemel Hempstead business park is the modern head office of Walker Greenbank - an unassuming little furnishings company specialising in very expensive wallpaper. Apart from a brief moment of fame three years ago, when it supplied \u00a3350-a-roll Pugin prints for the Lord Chancellor's opulent apartments, it has scarcely pricked the public consciousness. However, behind the scenes, the company has played host to a quite extraordinary drama of power, loathing, money and ambition. The City is furious with the group, having watched its shares collapse from 105p to 36p over the last five years. One of the few analysts still prepared to follow the company remarks: \"If management schools ever want a case study of how not to run a business, this is it.\" Even City financiers accustomed to hostile bids were startled by the slanging match last week when former chief executive Charles Wightman declared he was considering launching a \u00a330m offer for Walker Greenbank. The company's boss, Aidan Connolly, denounced him as \"an obsessive\" and \"an amateur investor\", saying: \"He should put up or shut up - is disruptive tactics are costing shareholders money.\" Mr Wightman's responded: \"With the strategy they're following at the moment they might as well take all the money and pour it out of the window.\" This is far from a one off - Mr Wightman has threatened three times to bid for the company, then backed down after a brief but ferocious exchange of insults. The roots of the dispute go back to 1998, when Mr Wightman presided over the \u00a370m sale of Walker Greenbank's commercial wallcoverings business - an unsexy operation supplying decorations for offices, airports and hotels. After the disposal Mr Wightman stepped down with two other directors, taking away a combined payoff of \u00a32.9m. In fact, Wightman had been acrimoniously ousted after a boardroom row. A delegation of staff, including Connolly, made allegations about Wightman to the group's non-executive directors. Chequered past One was that he had lost the confidence of shareholders. The other was that despite boardroom opposition, he was planning to buy a 16-bedroom Buckinghamshire mansion as the company's new head office. Wightman denies both. Connolly took the top job despite his chequered past - his previous positions included a stint at a Turkish airline, Telia, which went bust after a fatal plane crash, and a period on the board of Baileys Blinds - a now defunct furnishings company. Progress has been slow. The company issued a profits warning, blaming the strong pound. Then a new computer system failed, forcing staff to input details of every order manually. A number of customers took their business elsewhere. \"Things have been difficult,\" concedes Connolly. \"We inherited a poor situation. It's been difficult to improve things when everywhere you turn you find misleading comments about yourself.\" Walker Greenbank felt embattled - it threatened to sue the internet service provider Hemscott.com over a series of postings on its bulletin boards about the company and about Connolly - referred to as \"the fat controller\". The allegations, posted by a friend of Wightman, were swiftly erased from the website, although Wightman insists that they were all true. Wightman first threatened to bid for the company in July last year. A couple of days later the Walker Greenbank financial adviser SBC Warburg resigned, complaining it had not been informed of the approach.

      "bodyText": "Back to business for the City yesterday after Wednesday's unexpected Bank Holiday status. Perhaps it was the start of a new financial year, the summer in the City, or possibly the perspective offered by a few hours away from those flashing numbers, but the FTSE was in a much more healthy and happy state of mind yesterday. The main index closed up 71.8 points at 6,451.1. Moreover the Techmark index, on a roller-coaster ride in recent weeks, put in a spectacular performance as investors piled back into tech stocks, and closed the session up 383.7 at 4,148.53. Volume was a hefty 1.795bn shares in 135,583 trades, boosted by a clump of early morning trades as investors who had failed to transact their business on Wednesday because of the stock exchange pricing debacle tried to turn their gains into profits. Just as important for the health of the equities economy was the return to tech stocks on both sides of the Atlantic. Telecoms, media and hi-tech led the market's advance throughout the day as investors used the recent market volatility to cherry-pick the best of the \"new economy\" stocks, and as a consequence \"old economy\" issues suffered. Logica led the pack higher, up 288p at \u00a321.08, with Baltimore up 968p at \u00a375.88, CMG up 510p at \u00a345.60 and Thus up 43p at 422p. Sage Group added 69p to 705p and palmtop computer maker Psion, a recent victim, rose 363p to \u00a337.04. Psion might be a major beneficiary of Microsoft's much publicised woes. Vodafone AirTouch was sharply higher, up 24p at 343p. QXL.com rose a scarcely credible 340p to 606p. Durlacher joined the party, up 62p to 223p, Pace Micro rose 153p to 877p and Atlantic Telecom joined the upthrust, ending 100p higher at 900p. Another possible benificiary of Microsoft's woes, Filtronic, firmed 170p to \u00a317.90. Biotech stocks did well, too, with Celltech - 189p higher at \u00a312.72 - topping the list of FTSE 100 risers. At the other end of the scale the \"old economy\" stocks suffered a drubbing, particularly financial shares. Halifax fell 56p to 638p and Abbey National closed 45p lower at 822p. Barclays, whose top executives are working to a lavish bonus payment scheme revealed in this paper yesterday, shed 78p to \u00a316.18. Glaxo Wellcome shed 95p to \u00a318.41 and SmithKline Beecham lost 47p to 838p, although AstraZeneca bucked the drugs trend by rising 37p at \u00a327.84.",

The textile and clothing strategy group, comprising unions, academics and industry leaders, complains that although a significant number of companies are eligible for aid - so-called selective financial assistance - there is anecdotal evidence that some DTI officials \"are not convinced of the merit in supporting investments in this sector\". It says the perception should be vigorously challenged by an industry, Britain's eighth largest manufacturer, which has an annual turnover of more than \u00a314bn. More than 40,000 workers, mainly women, have been thrown out of work during the past year, and the beleaguered trade secretary, Stephen Byers, is facing renewed pressure from restless Labour backbenchers and union leaders for multimillion-pound aid to save the crisis-hit industry. With many of the factory closures taking place in the north and the midlands, Labour MPs believe ministers are increasingly vulnerable to the charge that they are abandoning traditional industries in favour of hi-tech clusters in the south. In a new strategy document, to be published next month, the group underpins this criticism by claiming the government is quite prepared to provide substantial support \"for the latest fashionable theories\" such as clusters. Redundancies in the industry, now running at more than 600 a week, have been fuelled by the decision of Marks &amp; Spencer to end contracts with some clothing manufacturers. Fears have been reinforced in heated correspondence between union leaders and Mr Byers and his junior minister, Patricia Hewitt, who represents a constituency - in Leicester - with large number of textile workers. John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, believes the government would have been much more robust in defence of the industry if the jobs of blue collar workers were threatened. But replying to Mr Edmonds, Mr Byers has said intervention is not an option and that \"preferential treatment... simply is not on the agenda\". Patricia Hewitt has been similarly dismissive. \"I appreciate the widespread concern ... about the number of job losses in this sector,\" she told Des Farrell, national secretary of the GMB's clothing and textile section. \"The government has no locus to intervene in the commercial decisions of individual companies.\" The unions, in turn, have accused the government of double standards.

The commission is using an \"enumeration date\" of February 16 2000. That means the constituencies it recommends to the home secretary will be based on electoral rolls compiled in October 1999, but the commission does not have to report until April 2007. Given that the next general election is likely to be held in 2001, with the following election in 2005 or 2006, it is possible that the constituencies it recommends will not be used until an election in, say, 2009. By then the electorate data will be 10 years out of date. </p> <p>The boundary commissions for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will probably not start their reviews for another year at least, with later enumeration dates. They, too, need not report until 2007. This matters a great deal in Scotland because the Scotland Act 1997 requires the boundary commission for Scotland to use the same electoral quota as that employed for England (during the forthcoming review only), in order to reduce Scotland's over-representation in the Commons after the creation of the Scottish parliament. This could mean that over-representation will not be removed for at least two more parliaments - but when it does, Scotland could lose as many as 12 of its current complement of 72 MPs. </p> <p>Amazingly, no similar reduction of the over-representation of Wales was proposed when the Welsh assembly was established. Wales is already over-represented at Westminster. In 1997, the average MP in Wales represented 55,000 constituents while the average England MP represented about 70,000. </p> <p>This disparity could even increase. The Wales commission's last report in 1995 argued that the combination of rules and geography makes a 41st seat almost inevitable this time, even if the electorate stays the same as in 1993. Northern Ireland already has the maximum number of seats allowed - 18. </p> <p>There has to be a better way. When he was home secretary, Kenneth Clarke claimed that there was \"no compelling need for any changes in the rules\" which the boundary commissions must operate. This is not the view of experts. Reviews of the legislation have been promised by other home secretaries, but nothing has emerged and there is nothing in the political parties, elections and referendums bill introduced last December. </p> <p>The commissions do an excellent job within a set of rules described as \"confusing and contradictory\" by elections expert David Butler: the upshot is \"muddle and incomprehension\". It is time these rules were removed. The process could be speeded up substantially. </p> <p>Review would take no more than two years (longer than it took in 1885 and 1918) if two changes are made. First, the rules under which the commissions operate should be made unambiguous: in particular, the catch-all, largely subjective requirement to minimise the breaking of local ties should be removed. Secondly, time-consuming local inquiries should be abolished. </p> <p>Without the need to consider local ties, decisions on which set of boundaries to adopt should be taken on objective grounds, notably the equalisation of electorates but also respecting local government boundaries and minimising the disruption to existing constituencies. </p> <p>The unedifying prospect of political parties dressing up their partisan ends by reference to factors such as bus routes, school catchment areas and even (as occurred during the last review) the location of golf courses and regimental recruiting patterns, would be a thing of the past.
