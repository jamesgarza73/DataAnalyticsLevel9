Privately, they describe the move as more of an attempt to throw a lifeline to the Post Office. </p> <p>The banks, which expect to hear as soon as today precisely how much the government believes the project will cost, are already connected to each other by Link and could use the same technology to set up connections with the Post Office. </p> <p>\"Link could facilitate the operation of the universal bank and also the so-called basic bank accounts,\" one source said. </p> <p>The basic accounts, which do not allow overdrafts, are being set up by the banks under instruction from the Treasury. </p> <p>Link refused to comment yesterday although the government is understood to be keen that only one organisation runs the operation. </p> <p>The Treasury, Department of Trade and Industry and the Post Office yesterday refused to disclose their estimates of the cost of running the universal bank. </p> <p>In the face of concerns that the eventual cost could run to between \u00a3150m to \u00a3400m annually, the Post Office said: \"We don't recognise these figures or anything close to them\". However, one of the high street banks, HBSC, was prepared to admit last night that it expects its annual cost to be \u00a320m alone. </p> <p>Through letters to the chief executives of the high street banks this week, the DTI is expected to try to allay concerns about the cost of running the universal bank. </p> <p>The New Economics Foundation lobby group last night called for banks to contribute just 0.2% of their profits to support a network of \"community\" banks. </p> <p>The research, by Derek French of the Campaign for Community Banking Services, argues that the clearing banks could share the branches which could be in pubs or churches.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Link cash machine network last night emerged as the leading contender to run the controversial Post Office- based universal bank. Industry sources say Link, which connects all the hole-in-the-wall machines around the country, could provide the technology to hook up the big banks with the 18,000-strong post office network. This would solve one of the barriers to creating the universal bank, which is being designed to provide bank accounts to some 3m recipients of social security payments who do not have accounts. Some of the big banks are concerned they could end up paying as much as \u00a3400m a year to provide accounts to the \"financially excluded\". Privately, they describe the move as more of an attempt to throw a lifeline to the Post Office. The banks, which expect to hear as soon as today precisely how much the government believes the project will cost, are already connected to each other by Link and could use the same technology to set up connections with the Post Office. \"Link could facilitate the operation of the universal bank and also the so-called basic bank accounts,\" one source said. The basic accounts, which do not allow overdrafts, are being set up by the banks under instruction from the Treasury. Link refused to comment yesterday although the government is understood to be keen that only one organisation runs the operation. The Treasury, Department of Trade and Industry and the Post Office yesterday refused to disclose their estimates of the cost of running the universal bank. In the face of concerns that the eventual cost could run to between \u00a3150m to \u00a3400m annually, the Post Office said: \"We don't recognise these figures or anything close to them\". However, one of the high street banks, HBSC, was prepared to admit last night that it expects its annual cost to be \u00a320m alone. Through letters to the chief executives of the high street banks this week, the DTI is expected to try to allay concerns about the cost of running the universal bank. The New Economics Foundation lobby group last night called for banks to contribute just 0.2% of their profits to support a network of \"community\" banks. The research, by Derek French of the Campaign for Community Banking Services, argues that the clearing banks could share the branches which could be in pubs or churches.",

Greenfield investment is regarded as a good thing for generating new jobs and providing a more stable source of foreign capital than hot money flows into shares or other financial investments. But the impact of M&amp;A on development is double edged and uneven, says Unctad. Rather than adding to productive assets in a country, M&amp;As simply transfer ownership of existing ones. In the case of a firm which would otherwise go bankrupt, the arrival of a new foreign owner is obviously beneficial. But often transfer of ownership can lead to job losses, not gains, as the acquiring company reorganises production in line with its corporate strategy rather than to the benefit of the host country. </p> <p>Foreign investment carried by M&amp;As can also threaten competition. Acquiring companies may get a stranglehold on an industry, restricting choice and keeping prices high. Developing countries rarely have effective competition policies to counter such threats. </p> <p>Unctad draws parallels between the emergence of a national market in the US at the end of the 19th century and a global one today. Then, a massive M&amp;A boom and resulting concerns about competition prompted the federal government to develop anti-trust legislation (today the US has one of the most effective competition regimes in the developed world).

Asked about his favourite websites, Kelly named expectingrain.com and woolyrockstars.com. Pernickety readers, i.e. those that go through absolutely everything with a fine-tooth comb, immediately pointed out that the latter website does not in fact exist. More importantly neither the .com or the .co.uk domain names for Woolyrockstars have been registered. Was Kelly making a mockery of us all or was he merely pointing out a new market niche? Kelly says neither: \"I'm very much afraid this thing does exist. The url, however, is woollyrockers.com. Check it out!!\" Duh! Monkey did and fell in love with the Bee Gees doll. Could Kelly have created a monster? </p> <p><strong>Minutes matter</strong><br>What's this? The BBC's famously impartial news reporting standards slipping over its own 10pm news bulletin announcement? The Monkey has got its paws on an internal email from BBC Online producer James Thornet that was sent round after the news broke to BBC online hacks out in the sticks. He draws his colleagues' attention to the fact that the switch to 10pm means the regional bulletin tacked on at the end of the proper, grown-up news will be extended to a massive six-and-a-half minutes. \"We must put this story at the top of online news stories asap,\" says the excitable Thornett. Is he worried viewers in the regions wouldn't notice the difference otherwise? </p> <p><strong>Only slimline warriors need apply</strong><br> Monkey has received an email from Rainbow network, home of Xena fans (see proud to portly, below), anxious to set the record straight. \"Firstly, the generosity of Channel 5 in offering Rainbow a box of T-shirts goes without saying - we were delighted to receive them, and we had loads of entrants to the competition in which they were the prize.

The honey pot subsequently attacked all surrounding computers and made everything in the office sticky. Eugh.

Rumours have started to surface about a mooted merger between the two e-commerce giants, which have both been rocked by the recent downturn in dot.com fortunes. A tie-up would make sense, particularly for Amazon, which is struggling to convince investors of its long-term earnings. Perhaps it should take a leaf from eBay's gimmick book and start sending out plants and pots of bottled Amazon river water to prove to investors that Amazon can make things grow. Just a (naff) suggestion. <br> <br> <strong>Proud to portly</strong><br> Channel 5 kindly sent 50 of its finest Xena, Warrior Princess T-shirts to the gay and lesbian website Rainbownetwork.com for a competition giveaway, on account of the pigtailed one being terribly popular with the target audience. Channel 5 was staggered, then, when Rainbow very apologetically sent them all back. It seems the T-shirts are of the cropped belly button-baring variety and, after a bit of market research in the office, Rainbow discovered they were too petite for its users. Seems a shame to let them go to waste, so Monkey is happy to try to squeeze into one to show support. <br> <br> <strong>Bad taste sensation</strong><br> GMTV managing director Christopher Stoddart is so concerned about reports of tasteless office banter that he has issued an email to all staff reminding them of the company's equal opportunities policy. In a carefully worded memo, he also reminded staff of the company's grievance procedure and told them that they mustn't feel frightened of whistle-blowing on their bosses. \"From time to time we will be drawing your attention to important company policies which we all need to follow. Our equal opportunities policy is particularly important because its scope is both on-screen and off-screen,\" he wrote. \"Should any employee have a complaint under this policy [or for any other reason] he should feel free to raise the matter.\" He continued: \"If it concerns their line manager, then they may wish to consult personnel.\" Who on earth has prompted this and what on earth did he or she say?

A few weeks ago top Sunday Biz hack Richard Northedge wrote a coruscating profile of some suit or other doing something fantastically important in the City. Two weeks later a frighteningly similar article (exactly the same except for two small amendments) appeared in the Scotsman's revamped business section, albeit under a different byline. Perhaps Northedge should sue for plagiarism. But then the ed-in-chief of the pink Sunday is one Andrew Neil, who is also in charge of the Scotsman.

Kenneth Wolstenholme, commentator at the historic 1966 England World Cup victory at Wembley over Germany, hadn't been invited to the England-Germany match on Saturday, the final game before the stadium is demolished. Now Sport First has hired the game's most memorable voice to write about the last match. What a joy, says Kenneth.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Those who doubt the wisdom of the Human Rights Act tend to see the rights and freedoms in the European Convention on Human Rights in terms of absolutes - leading on the one hand to a culture of rights without responsibilities, and on the other to a situation where rights are at risk of being removed by judges who are unelected and unaccountable. There is a balance to be struck if our human rights law is to win and retain public confidence. </p> <p>The court's task is to strike a fair balance between the interest of the community and the protection of the individual. I agree with those who say that the purpose of the Convention is to create a fair and decent society, not to let criminals off the hook, and that victims and witnesses have rights too. </p> <p>Some guidance as to where this will all lead us is available from north of the border. The system of devolution that was created for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland requires the devolved legislatures and executives to legislate and to act in a manner compatible with the Convention rights. In Scotland, since devolution in May 1999, lawyers have been active in raising issues about possible incompatibility. But statistics about the success rate of Scottish cases are an imperfect guide to what will happen north and south of the border now that the Human Rights Act has come into force. [The Human Rights Act covers all public authorities; the Scotland Act, under which cases have been brought north of the border since May 1999, covers only the devolved legislature and executive.] In Scotland the great majority of issues raised have been in criminal cases, not in the much wider field over which the Human Rights Act now extends and these issues have been directed almost entirely to the acts of the public prosecutor. So the development of the case law has been on a narrow front. </p> <p>The low success rate in Scotland (one assessment suggests that of more than 600 legal challenges in the past 12 months only 16 have been successful) is largely due to the fact that many challenges relate to elements of the right to a fair trial, such as delay, admissibility of evidence and the effect of prejudicial publicity. The Scottish judges have been following the European Court of Human Rights in deciding that the fairness of the trial must be determined in the light of the proceedings as a whole, and are discouraging attempts to have these issues determined before conclusion of the trial. But now that the way is open for challenges across the entire field of action by public authorities the success rate is much less predictable. My guess is that it is likely to increase. </p> <p>What is likely to happen next? Judges are urging lawyers to be restrained in the cases they bring, and are urging their colleagues to be robust in refusing to allow such challenges, as indeed they should be if they are plainly unmeritorious. On the other hand, the Lord Chancellor has said that the value of the Human Rights Act lies in the fact that people will be saved the trouble of taking their cases to the court in Strasbourg. It seems to me that there is an uneasy relationship between these two points of view. </p> <p>If people are to be saved the trouble of going to Strasbourg they will have to be able to obtain their remedy here. The fact that it is simpler and quicker to apply to the courts of this country is bound to lead in the short term, as it has in Scotland, to a great increase in the number of cases. But I do not see this as reason for treating such applications any more robustly than any other kind of application, or for asking lawyers to exercise greater restraint in bringing them than they would in other cases. The tradition in this country is that the courts are open to any person who feels his rights have been infringed. Lawyers owe a duty of care to their clients, and the House of Lords recently held that even in the courtroom they no longer have immunity against claims for negligence.

      "bodyText": "Those who doubt the wisdom of the Human Rights Act tend to see the rights and freedoms in the European Convention on Human Rights in terms of absolutes - leading on the one hand to a culture of rights without responsibilities, and on the other to a situation where rights are at risk of being removed by judges who are unelected and unaccountable. There is a balance to be struck if our human rights law is to win and retain public confidence. The court's task is to strike a fair balance between the interest of the community and the protection of the individual. I agree with those who say that the purpose of the Convention is to create a fair and decent society, not to let criminals off the hook, and that victims and witnesses have rights too. Some guidance as to where this will all lead us is available from north of the border. The system of devolution that was created for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland requires the devolved legislatures and executives to legislate and to act in a manner compatible with the Convention rights. In Scotland, since devolution in May 1999, lawyers have been active in raising issues about possible incompatibility. But statistics about the success rate of Scottish cases are an imperfect guide to what will happen north and south of the border now that the Human Rights Act has come into force. [The Human Rights Act covers all public authorities; the Scotland Act, under which cases have been brought north of the border since May 1999, covers only the devolved legislature and executive.] In Scotland the great majority of issues raised have been in criminal cases, not in the much wider field over which the Human Rights Act now extends and these issues have been directed almost entirely to the acts of the public prosecutor. So the development of the case law has been on a narrow front. The low success rate in Scotland (one assessment suggests that of more than 600 legal challenges in the past 12 months only 16 have been successful) is largely due to the fact that many challenges relate to elements of the right to a fair trial, such as delay, admissibility of evidence and the effect of prejudicial publicity. The Scottish judges have been following the European Court of Human Rights in deciding that the fairness of the trial must be determined in the light of the proceedings as a whole, and are discouraging attempts to have these issues determined before conclusion of the trial. But now that the way is open for challenges across the entire field of action by public authorities the success rate is much less predictable. My guess is that it is likely to increase. What is likely to happen next? Judges are urging lawyers to be restrained in the cases they bring, and are urging their colleagues to be robust in refusing to allow such challenges, as indeed they should be if they are plainly unmeritorious. On the other hand, the Lord Chancellor has said that the value of the Human Rights Act lies in the fact that people will be saved the trouble of taking their cases to the court in Strasbourg. It seems to me that there is an uneasy relationship between these two points of view. If people are to be saved the trouble of going to Strasbourg they will have to be able to obtain their remedy here. The fact that it is simpler and quicker to apply to the courts of this country is bound to lead in the short term, as it has in Scotland, to a great increase in the number of cases. But I do not see this as reason for treating such applications any more robustly than any other kind of application, or for asking lawyers to exercise greater restraint in bringing them than they would in other cases. The tradition in this country is that the courts are open to any person who feels his rights have been infringed. Lawyers owe a duty of care to their clients, and the House of Lords recently held that even in the courtroom they no longer have immunity against claims for negligence. So the judges are in no position to complain if counsel err on the side of caution in their own interest in making these applications. They must also appreciate that the courts, as public authorities, are themselves under a duty of compliance with the Convention rights. The UK will still be under an obligation in international law to bring its domestic law into line with the Convention as interpreted by that court, even if this conflicts with the view taken by our judges. So I would favour caution, in the initial stages at least, rather than robustness - lest, in a fit of enthusiasm for throwing cases out, the judges find themselves on the wrong end of a challenge under article six of the Convention, the right to a fair hearing. \u0095 This is an edited extract of a lecture by Lord Hope to the law reform group Justice.",

Jacquet, even if he could be persuaded to consider the offer, would be an unwise choice since his World Cup triumph of 1998 came not as a result of his individual coaching genius but as the consequence of several years of highly focused work by a large team.

      "bodyText": "So much for the People's Choice. The sudden departure of Kevin Keegan following Saturday's defeat by Germany at Wembley illustrates with devastating clarity the danger of basing the selection of England's head coach on enthusiasm, personal popularity, and a hunch. Keegan was as accurate in his Saturday-night self-analysis - \"I came up short\" - as he was misguided in his decision last year to turn the original part-time commission into a permanent posting. Perhaps this time the job will be entrusted to a man with the qualities and the qualifications necessary to meet the cruel and unusual demands of the task. But that scenario, of course, presupposes the existence of a governing body with the intelligence and willpower required to take the right decisions, rather than being guided in its choice by the instincts of the mob. In football terms, this is England's Year Zero. Nothing new there. Similar words were said when Revie fled to Saudi Arabia, when Robson gave up, when Taylor imploded, and when Hoddle's inarticulacy blew up in his face. But this time it must be for real. Whatever the temptation to appoint a high-profile manager with a successful record, and however much the Football Association may be impressed by Rudi V\u00f6ller's swift transformation of German fortunes, nothing less than a complete commitment to the root-and-branch restructuring of England's coaching will do.

      "body": "<p>The defeat that hastened Kevin Keegan's departure as England coach was largely brought about through an English diamond being trumped by German hearts. Keegan employed a tactic of the 70s and saw it outpassed, outwitted and outrun by the football of the new millennium. </p> <p>It was England's worst performance in a qualifier since Graham Taylor's side lost 2-0 to Norway in Oslo in 1993 and was precipitated by a similarly flawed strategy. For just as Taylor had declared Gary Pallister, a centre-half, a full-back inorder to counter the threat of long high balls reaching the lofty Jostein Flo on the right, so Keegan played Gareth Southgate, a central defender, in midfield hoping to minimise the influence of Mehmet Scholl behind the German strikers. </p> <p>Taylor's plan backfired from the moment that Flo switched to the left wing and took Pallister with him. Keegan's ploy foundered because Rudi V\u00f6ller, the Germany coach, disobligingly played Oliver Bierhoff as a lone central striker with Scholl roaming far and wide. </p> <p>Southgate was once a workaday midfielder with Crystal Palace but became an established international as the spare man in defence. He soon lost track of Scholl and thereafter appeared confused as to what his role should be. </p> <p>As a result the diamond became a rhomboid with David Beckham drifting in from the right to search for the ball, Nick Barmby uncertain as to whether he should do likewise on the left, and Paul Scholes inundated by Germans when the opposition broke away. </p> <p>Things might have been better, during that apocalyptically bad first half for England, had the full-backs Gary Neville and Graeme le Saux provided the team with consistent width and supplied the quality of centres needed to disturb Germany's back three. </p> <p>Neville, however, simply froze at the idea of crossing the halfway line and Le Saux, though willing to move forward on the left, was increasingly hampered by a tight muscle. After half-time Neville gave way to the pacy Kieron Dyer and Southgate went back into defence. England had a better shape but by then the shape of the match was unalterable. </p> <p>Most of the time England's two strikers, Andrew Cole and Michael Owen, scarcely brought a wrinkle to the foreheads of Jens Nowotny and the other German defenders, so poor was the service from midfield and the wings. To the end Nowotny was able to stride upfield to help set up chances which might have increased England's humiliation, always assuming this was possible.</p> <p>The amount of freedom Germany were allowed in midfield was embarrassing. Dietmar Hamann is a competent footballer for Liverpool in the Premiership but the way England played he was allowed to become another G\u00fcnter Netzer. </p> <p>Likewise Carsten Ramelow and Michael Ballack had all the time and room they needed to bring the ball out of defence and swing lazily past what was often token opposition. On the right wing Marco Bode, tall, athletic and with good close control, reminded Wembley of just how far Neville has receded as an international defender, and on the left the 20-year-old Sebastian Deisler put into perspective all those optimistic noises about the quality of youngsters England are supposed to possess. </p> <p>Yes, Joe Cole, Gareth Barry and Titus Bramble might, just might, become decent international players, and others will have good careers in the Premiership. But compared with Argentina, say, the budding talent in England with genuine world-class potential would not fill a window box. </p> <p>England are caught in a three-way trap, with promising young players not yet ready, some of the thirtysomethings past their sell-by dates and too many of those in between simply not up to international standard.</p> <p>Nick Barmby, for example, was rightly talked up for a recall before Euro 2000 because he was in form and Keegan had no one else with left-wing inclinations. But on Saturday he was in a position to be compared with Deisler and in truth there was no comparison. </p> <p>Tony Adams was England's best player, especially when trying to stop the tide before half-time. But a successor should have come along before now. As for David Seaman, the goal he conceded after 14 minutes was, on the evidence of his erratic form for Arsenal over the past 18 months, an accident waiting to happen.</p> <p>Hamann's free-kick, taken from a central position at a range of more than 30 yards, brushed Scholes's boot but was still saveable.

      "bodyText": "The defeat that hastened Kevin Keegan's departure as England coach was largely brought about through an English diamond being trumped by German hearts. Keegan employed a tactic of the 70s and saw it outpassed, outwitted and outrun by the football of the new millennium. It was England's worst performance in a qualifier since Graham Taylor's side lost 2-0 to Norway in Oslo in 1993 and was precipitated by a similarly flawed strategy. For just as Taylor had declared Gary Pallister, a centre-half, a full-back inorder to counter the threat of long high balls reaching the lofty Jostein Flo on the right, so Keegan played Gareth Southgate, a central defender, in midfield hoping to minimise the influence of Mehmet Scholl behind the German strikers. Taylor's plan backfired from the moment that Flo switched to the left wing and took Pallister with him. Keegan's ploy foundered because Rudi V\u00f6ller, the Germany coach, disobligingly played Oliver Bierhoff as a lone central striker with Scholl roaming far and wide. Southgate was once a workaday midfielder with Crystal Palace but became an established international as the spare man in defence. He soon lost track of Scholl and thereafter appeared confused as to what his role should be. As a result the diamond became a rhomboid with David Beckham drifting in from the right to search for the ball, Nick Barmby uncertain as to whether he should do likewise on the left, and Paul Scholes inundated by Germans when the opposition broke away. Things might have been better, during that apocalyptically bad first half for England, had the full-backs Gary Neville and Graeme le Saux provided the team with consistent width and supplied the quality of centres needed to disturb Germany's back three. Neville, however, simply froze at the idea of crossing the halfway line and Le Saux, though willing to move forward on the left, was increasingly hampered by a tight muscle. After half-time Neville gave way to the pacy Kieron Dyer and Southgate went back into defence. England had a better shape but by then the shape of the match was unalterable. Most of the time England's two strikers, Andrew Cole and Michael Owen, scarcely brought a wrinkle to the foreheads of Jens Nowotny and the other German defenders, so poor was the service from midfield and the wings. To the end Nowotny was able to stride upfield to help set up chances which might have increased England's humiliation, always assuming this was possible. The amount of freedom Germany were allowed in midfield was embarrassing. Dietmar Hamann is a competent footballer for Liverpool in the Premiership but the way England played he was allowed to become another G\u00fcnter Netzer. Likewise Carsten Ramelow and Michael Ballack had all the time and room they needed to bring the ball out of defence and swing lazily past what was often token opposition. On the right wing Marco Bode, tall, athletic and with good close control, reminded Wembley of just how far Neville has receded as an international defender, and on the left the 20-year-old Sebastian Deisler put into perspective all those optimistic noises about the quality of youngsters England are supposed to possess. Yes, Joe Cole, Gareth Barry and Titus Bramble might, just might, become decent international players, and others will have good careers in the Premiership. But compared with Argentina, say, the budding talent in England with genuine world-class potential would not fill a window box. England are caught in a three-way trap, with promising young players not yet ready, some of the thirtysomethings past their sell-by dates and too many of those in between simply not up to international standard. Nick Barmby, for example, was rightly talked up for a recall before Euro 2000 because he was in form and Keegan had no one else with left-wing inclinations. But on Saturday he was in a position to be compared with Deisler and in truth there was no comparison. Tony Adams was England's best player, especially when trying to stop the tide before half-time. But a successor should have come along before now. As for David Seaman, the goal he conceded after 14 minutes was, on the evidence of his erratic form for Arsenal over the past 18 months, an accident waiting to happen. Hamann's free-kick, taken from a central position at a range of more than 30 yards, brushed Scholes's boot but was still saveable. Seaman, however, was out of position and dived too late to do anything but get a hand to it. Maybe England had not wanted to offend German sensitivities by building a wall. Certainly their idea of a wall belonged to A Midsummer Night's Dream, with one man playing the part. No wonder, perhaps, that Seaman dropped a brick. England (4-4-2): Seaman; Neville (Dyer, h-t), Keown, Adams, Le Saux (Barry, 77min); Beckham (Parlour, 82), Southgate, Scholes, Barmby; Cole, Owen. Germany (3-5-1-1): Kahn; Rehmer, Nowotny, Linke; Deisler, Ramelow, Hamann, Ballack, Bode (Ziege, 86); Scholl; Bierhoff. Referee: S Braschi (Italy). \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Next month it will be encouraging the world to take part in a Buy Nothing Day and this month it is running a \"creative resistance contest\" to encourage worldwide cultural rebellion. Its ideas come from the French Situationists and from Marshal McLuhan but its concepts and execution are very much twenty-first century. </p> <p>The manifesto at the back of the bi-monthly explains who is behind the publication: \"We are a loose global network of artists, writers, environmentalists, ecological econo mists, media-literacy teachers, reborn lefties, ecofeminists, downshifters, high-school shit-disturbers, campus rabble-rousers, incorrigibles, malcontents and green entrepreneurs . . . We believe that culture jamming will become to our era what civil rights was to the 60s, feminism to the 70s, and environmental activism to the 80s . . . Above all, it will change the way we interact with the mass media and the way in which meaning is produced in our society.\" </p> <p>Adbusters was actually born more than 10 years ago, but it is only since the events of Seattle last year which led up to the demonstrations in Prague this year that it has suddenly started to break through to a much wider audience. Articles in its latest edition cover everything from the marketing of the American elections to a story about McDonald's in Lebanon, from a polemic on anarchism to news of what \"culture jammers\" have been up to in Japan. </p> <p>Its founder and editor-in-chief is 58-year-old Kalle Lasn, who left Estonia as a two-year-old, and grew up in Australia where he worked for the defence department before moving first to Tokyo where he was in market research and then to Canada. There he became an award- winning documentary film-maker before founding Adbusters, which was driven by his increasing disillusionment with the corporatisation of the world and the failure of conventional left politics to combat it. His philosophy is contained in the book Culture Jam, the Uncooling of America, where the list of dedications includes \"My mortal enemy, Philip Morris Inc which I vow to take down.\" </p> <p>Lasn believes that the mass media now dispense a form of the \"soma\" that Aldous Huxley predicted in Brave New World: \"The most powerful narcotic in the world is the promise of belonging. And belonging is best achieved by conforming to the prescriptions of America.\" In response, Lasn and his colleagues have set themselves the task of \"unswooshing America\" and \"jamming its image factory until it comes to a sudden, shuddering halt\". Adbusters is effectively the bulletin of that movement. </p> <p>Lasn estimates that we receive around 3,000 marketing messages in an average day, from the logos on people's clothes to the billboards or posters we pass, to the commercials on our televisions and the ads in our daily papers or the signs in our super markets; some research puts the figure even higher. Adbusters' aim is to start to reverse the process. </p> <p>\"At the beginning, I did feel we were talking to the converted,\" says Lasn, \"but all of a sudden there is a well-spring of interest.\" Initially, Adbusters was produced on newsprint and had only a small if loyal following, but it now sells 100,000 copies worldwide, mainly in the US, but also throughout Australia and New Zealand and with around 2,000 subscribers in the UK. Its small team of journalists, based in Vancouver, are mainly in their 20s and 30s. </p> <p>Lasn attributes the recent attention to the whole post-Seattle effect and certainly many of the ideas which come into the magazine and its website have the subversive message of the loose movement that has emerged since then and been seen on the streets of Washington, Philadelpia, Los Angeles and Prague. He sees the growth of a global anxiety that the magazine taps into. \"There is a messy feeling that things aren't quite right.\" Essentially he sees the magazine as a player in the epic battle between corporate culture and civic culture - \"a people-driven planet earth or a corporate-driven planet inc\". </p> <p>And for all the playful nature of the publication, Lasn and his colleagues are quite serious. As he put it in Culture Jam: \"Instead of treating vegetative, corporate-driven TV culture as something to be gently, ironically mocked, it's time to face the whole ugly spectre of our TV-addicted nation, the savage anomie of a society entranced and entrapped and living a lie. It's time to admit that chronic TV watching is North America's number-one mental health problem and that a society in which citizens spend a quarter of their waking lives (more than four hours a day) in front of their sets is in serious need of shock therapy.\" </p> <p>If you watch people flipping through Adbusters in a bookstore or newsagents, you can often sense the slight puzzlement on their faces. Is this ad for Absolut Vodka for real? Is this two-page photo-spread of an elderly man asking \"How can I die with dignity?\" an invitation to a website about dying? </p> <p>This is part of the magazine's intent, a desire to challenge the persuasion industry, to subvert the meaning in the message and to encourage people to become \"culture jammers\", taking on the corporations at their own game. \"Corporations advertise and culture jammers subvertise\", is one of their credos. Adbusters does take ads itself and will run \"advocacy advertisements\", such as either pro- or anti-abortion, but it reserves the right to vet every other kind of ad which means that most that do appear are mainly for books and CDs, rather than for, say, cars and alcohol. </p> <p>Some of the visuals are subversions of well-known ads but although all the likely suspects - Nike, McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Walt Disney - have been lampooned, only one has sued: \"Absolut Vodka came after us with a horde of lawyers, but we beat them back quite handsomely. They got scared and ran away with their tail between their legs. We have quite consciously provoked people like Nike and McDonald's - they haven't sued but they do subscribe.\" Lasn ran into problems, however, when he tried to advertise his Buy Nothing Day on television. All the major networks refused to run the commercials and CNN only agreed after being hounded by a reporter from the Wall Street Journal. </p> <p>But Adbusters remains optimistic. If not culture jam today, then certainly culture jam tomorrow.</p>",

Lasn attributes the recent attention to the whole post-Seattle effect and certainly many of the ideas which come into the magazine and its website have the subversive message of the loose movement that has emerged since then and been seen on the streets of Washington, Philadelpia, Los Angeles and Prague. He sees the growth of a global anxiety that the magazine taps into. \"There is a messy feeling that things aren't quite right.\" Essentially he sees the magazine as a player in the epic battle between corporate culture and civic culture - \"a people-driven planet earth or a corporate-driven planet inc\". And for all the playful nature of the publication, Lasn and his colleagues are quite serious. As he put it in Culture Jam: \"Instead of treating vegetative, corporate-driven TV culture as something to be gently, ironically mocked, it's time to face the whole ugly spectre of our TV-addicted nation, the savage anomie of a society entranced and entrapped and living a lie. It's time to admit that chronic TV watching is North America's number-one mental health problem and that a society in which citizens spend a quarter of their waking lives (more than four hours a day) in front of their sets is in serious need of shock therapy.\" If you watch people flipping through Adbusters in a bookstore or newsagents, you can often sense the slight puzzlement on their faces. Is this ad for Absolut Vodka for real? Is this two-page photo-spread of an elderly man asking \"How can I die with dignity?\" an invitation to a website about dying? This is part of the magazine's intent, a desire to challenge the persuasion industry, to subvert the meaning in the message and to encourage people to become \"culture jammers\", taking on the corporations at their own game. \"Corporations advertise and culture jammers subvertise\", is one of their credos. Adbusters does take ads itself and will run \"advocacy advertisements\", such as either pro- or anti-abortion, but it reserves the right to vet every other kind of ad which means that most that do appear are mainly for books and CDs, rather than for, say, cars and alcohol. Some of the visuals are subversions of well-known ads but although all the likely suspects - Nike, McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Walt Disney - have been lampooned, only one has sued: \"Absolut Vodka came after us with a horde of lawyers, but we beat them back quite handsomely. They got scared and ran away with their tail between their legs. We have quite consciously provoked people like Nike and McDonald's - they haven't sued but they do subscribe.\" Lasn ran into problems, however, when he tried to advertise his Buy Nothing Day on television. All the major networks refused to run the commercials and CNN only agreed after being hounded by a reporter from the Wall Street Journal. But Adbusters remains optimistic. If not culture jam today, then certainly culture jam tomorrow.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>KOO-GONE</strong></p> <p>Five o'clock on Saturday afternoon, and England manager Kelvin Koogan had failed to appear for the round of post-match interviews. By ten past, he'd been joined in a dispirited dressing room by FA chief executive Adam Crozier and FA not-sure-what-he-actually-does David Davies. Many were confused, but the Fiver immediately knew what was going on: a piqued Koog had obviously brained David Beckham with a misdirected flying teacup, and the supportive Crozier and Davies were helping him out of a sticky spot by bundling the late midfielder's cold corpse into a kit basket and dumping it on the back of the German bus.</p> <p>But if we're being brutally frank, we misread the situation. In actual fact, Koogan was handing in his resignation, a process which involved much soul searching, some heated debate and a bit of snivelling in the toilets. By half five, Koog had announced he was \"a little short\" at international level - as if his head ever troubled the dugout ceiling at Craven Cottage - and England were looking for a new manager. And before you could say \"Bryan\", \"Robson\" or \"you must be bloody joking\", the race was on.</p> <p>Sadly for the FA, the race was to see who could rule themselves out of the running first. \"I have only been here four months and I owe it to the players to see it out,\" said Leicester boss Peter Taylor, former manager of England Under-21s and massive mates with Howard Wilkinson. \"Some of them have signed long contracts because of me and some have come here because of me. I love it here and I want to put and end to the speculation.\"</p> <p>France's World Cup-winning coach Aime Jacquet wasn't showing much interest either: \"At the French Federation, I lead and I am pursuing passionate work with the coaches. That is fully sufficient for me.\" Meanwhile, jug-eared Sunderland boss Peter Reid - the name on nobody's lips - was swiftly removed from the reckoning by his chairman. \"Peter is dedicated to Sunderland and respects and values the autonomy of his position at the club,\" thundered Bob Murray, unfortunately making Reid sound like a despotic maniac.</p> <p>One figure who hasn't yet been ruled out for sure is Uncle Tom Cobleigh, but he was unavailable for comment at the time of writing. Another is Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger. The Gunners are prepared to give the FA permission to speak to their manager, but only because cocky chairman Peter Hill-Wood is sure Wenger will turn down any offer the FA make: \"He wouldn't say yes to the job. He would be crazy to take it. And Arsene Wenger is not crazy - he is far too sensible.\" You should have mentioned that Wenger is competent as well, Peter - that would have definitely ruled him out.</p> <p><strong>WHO NEXT? - THE CHOICE IS YOURS, SO TELL IT LIKE IT IS, THE WAY YOU SEE IT</strong></p> <p>Who do you want the next England boss to be? Given that bosses with proven motivational skills are now out of fashion, our vote goes to John Gregory, who can de-motivate with the best of them. Failing that, McCaff would be as good a choice as any.</p> <p>But don't let the Fiver influence you. Email your suggestions to the.boss@theguardian.com along with a bit of ill-thought-through reasoning. Give your email the subject heading 'Don't get me wrong, lovely bloke, but thank eff for that' and we'll publish the best tomorrow.</p> <p><strong>FINN GOD WE TRUST</strong></p> <p>We all want things to work out nicely for Howard Wilkinson, don't we? Well, fair point, but this time you're going to have to - he's in charge for England's match against Finland on Wednesday afternoon. And as he's got a massive injury crisis on his hands, he doesn't need any grief from you.</p> <p>Tony Adams and Graeme Le Saux were today ruled out of the match nobody will see because: a) it's on while everyone is still at work; and b) it's on some ropey digital channel or other. Adams injured his back - surprise! - in a Bisham Abbey training session this morning, while Le Saux failed a fitness test on his calf.</p> <p>Adams and Le Saux join David Beckham and Steven Gerrard on the sidelines, and that's a fair bit of talent to be without. The Fiver refuses to be despondent, however.

      "bodyText": "KOO-GONE Five o'clock on Saturday afternoon, and England manager Kelvin Koogan had failed to appear for the round of post-match interviews. By ten past, he'd been joined in a dispirited dressing room by FA chief executive Adam Crozier and FA not-sure-what-he-actually-does David Davies. Many were confused, but the Fiver immediately knew what was going on: a piqued Koog had obviously brained David Beckham with a misdirected flying teacup, and the supportive Crozier and Davies were helping him out of a sticky spot by bundling the late midfielder's cold corpse into a kit basket and dumping it on the back of the German bus. But if we're being brutally frank, we misread the situation. In actual fact, Koogan was handing in his resignation, a process which involved much soul searching, some heated debate and a bit of snivelling in the toilets. By half five, Koog had announced he was \"a little short\" at international level - as if his head ever troubled the dugout ceiling at Craven Cottage - and England were looking for a new manager. And before you could say \"Bryan\", \"Robson\" or \"you must be bloody joking\", the race was on. Sadly for the FA, the race was to see who could rule themselves out of the running first. \"I have only been here four months and I owe it to the players to see it out,\" said Leicester boss Peter Taylor, former manager of England Under-21s and massive mates with Howard Wilkinson. \"Some of them have signed long contracts because of me and some have come here because of me. I love it here and I want to put and end to the speculation.\" France's World Cup-winning coach Aime Jacquet wasn't showing much interest either: \"At the French Federation, I lead and I am pursuing passionate work with the coaches. That is fully sufficient for me.\" Meanwhile, jug-eared Sunderland boss Peter Reid - the name on nobody's lips - was swiftly removed from the reckoning by his chairman. \"Peter is dedicated to Sunderland and respects and values the autonomy of his position at the club,\" thundered Bob Murray, unfortunately making Reid sound like a despotic maniac. One figure who hasn't yet been ruled out for sure is Uncle Tom Cobleigh, but he was unavailable for comment at the time of writing. Another is Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger. The Gunners are prepared to give the FA permission to speak to their manager, but only because cocky chairman Peter Hill-Wood is sure Wenger will turn down any offer the FA make: \"He wouldn't say yes to the job. He would be crazy to take it. And Arsene Wenger is not crazy - he is far too sensible.\" You should have mentioned that Wenger is competent as well, Peter - that would have definitely ruled him out. WHO NEXT? - THE CHOICE IS YOURS, SO TELL IT LIKE IT IS, THE WAY YOU SEE IT Who do you want the next England boss to be? Given that bosses with proven motivational skills are now out of fashion, our vote goes to John Gregory, who can de-motivate with the best of them. Failing that, McCaff would be as good a choice as any. But don't let the Fiver influence you. Email your suggestions to the.boss@theguardian.com along with a bit of ill-thought-through reasoning. Give your email the subject heading 'Don't get me wrong, lovely bloke, but thank eff for that' and we'll publish the best tomorrow. FINN GOD WE TRUST We all want things to work out nicely for Howard Wilkinson, don't we? Well, fair point, but this time you're going to have to - he's in charge for England's match against Finland on Wednesday afternoon. And as he's got a massive injury crisis on his hands, he doesn't need any grief from you. Tony Adams and Graeme Le Saux were today ruled out of the match nobody will see because: a) it's on while everyone is still at work; and b) it's on some ropey digital channel or other. Adams injured his back - surprise! - in a Bisham Abbey training session this morning, while Le Saux failed a fitness test on his calf. Adams and Le Saux join David Beckham and Steven Gerrard on the sidelines, and that's a fair bit of talent to be without. The Fiver refuses to be despondent, however. Andy Cole and Paul Scholes have, unlike Le Saux, recovered from knocks taken on Saturday, and let's not forget the recall of in-form striker Teddy Sheringham. Not only that, Gary Neville's toe injury has cleared up, so he can play as well! OK, we've said too much.

      "body": "<p>After the months of speculation, denials, economies with the truth, bluffs and boasts, surely we are nearing the end of United News &amp; Media's grip on the Daily Express. No one can be fooled any longer. The for-sale sign is up at Ludgate House: the Daily and Sunday Express and the Daily Star are available. </p> <p>Companies that want to keep a business do not enter into serious talks with people wishing to buy it. They do not open their books for them. They do not, having received a bid, then suggest a sum that would satisfy them. </p> <p>Nor, if they really wish to grow the business, do they allow it to dangle in limbo, showing the minimum of interest in its problems and undermining staff morale. When the time comes to assess the Express stewardship of United's chief executive Clive Hollick, this tawdry end to his reign will overshadow his sincere attempts to make it work at the beginning. Indeed, if Hollick doesn't sell soon at a reasonable price to buyers willing to take on Fleet Street's biggest basket case, he may well merit the dubious title of the worst proprietor in modern press history (and that includes Robert Maxwell). </p> <p>Express Newspapers is the only media group that is going down in price with every passing year. Now the reason has become crystal clear. The papers don't make any money. Without revenue from the printing outfits, such as West Ferry, the company would be insolvent. </p> <p>Over the years, stretching back through Hollick's time into the regime of David Stevens, the once mighty Beaverbrook empire has been disembowelled. Assets have been ruthlessly stripped so that the paper once published from Fleet Street's finest building now finds itself a tenant in its Blackfriars editorial base. </p> <p>Absurdly, if cunningly, the papers' online manifestations have been detached to form a separate United division, Xilerate, which is not part of the sale. What the Barclay brothers are therefore trying to buy is just part of the entity that should form a newspaper group. No wonder their latest offer is so low. Does anyone seriously believe that the purchase price of a company with a turnover of \u00a3250m is going to reach \u00a3200m? </p> <p>So let's try to make some sense out of this mess. Frederick and David Barclay, through their Press Holdings group and its publisher, Andrew Neil, have been trying to buy Express Newspapers for about 18 months. Other possible buyers, such as Trinity-Mirror and Independent Newspapers, have turned their backs on the idea. Since the Express titles do not make a profit, the monopolies problem would probably vanish, but neither has shown any real interest. </p> <p>Mohamed Al Fayed has been mentioned as a potential bidder but there is a big question mark over whether he has the money, or the will, to match his supposed ambition. </p> <p>Though Hollick is known to be furious about the public revelation of the Barclays' bid, because it contradicts all the official denials that the papers are not for sale, the publicity might just flush out other hopeful buyers. For the moment, though, the only game in town is being played by the Barclays. They have bid at least \u00a375m, but it isn't their final offer: they will pay what the company is worth. By chance, they have a first-class idea about its current value.

It sounds a reasonable sum to me, but compare it to the \u00a385m enjoyed by the Daily Mail alone and it looks hopelessly inadequate. </p> <p>I noted the Daily Express's recent front-page assault on the government over pensions was headlined \"Peanuts\" and wondered whether it was a subtle message from editor Rosie Boycott to Hollick about the failure to increase her editorial spend. She is known to be deeply unhappy about the turn of events last week. \"I'll be extremely sad if the paper goes to the Barclays,\" she said, \"because they'll be against all we've been trying to do here.\" Since she took control in April 1998, Boycott has transformed the Express's former Tory political agenda, first aligning it with Tony Blair's New Labour and then, of late, championing the cause of those who feel neglected by the government, such as pensioners and NHS patients. </p> <p>While Hollick, a lifelong Labour supporter, has undoubtedly been pleased with the paper's politics in general, he has not been a hands-on proprietor in terms of content. He certainly had nothing to do with the recent attacks on Blair's policies, even though he was upset at the decision by trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers to back the competition commission's veto on his company's giant TV merger with Carlton. </p> <p>Indeed, according to many Express journalists, it is Hollick's lack of attention to the paper that causes dismay. Why does he want it, they ask? Does he care? This is a reasonable point. If the papers aren't making money, there is no business reason for keeping them. If he doesn't use them to back his party, then there is no political reason for having them. There is pride, of course, but that generally comes before a fall. </p> <p>Anyway, if Hollick were to sell to the Barclays in the end, would it be such a bad move? I can understand Boycott's concern for her own future and that of her politically committed staff. Neil is unlikely to share her view that the paper could make a profit by appealing to a supposed niche audience of a left-leaning lower middle class somewhere between the Guardian and Mirror readerships. </p> <p>On the other hand, he cannot hope to go head to head with the Daily Mail on its traditional right-wing territory.

Sure, he had an unhappy time failing to save the European from the dustbin of history, but who really thought it would ever work?

      "bodyText": "After the months of speculation, denials, economies with the truth, bluffs and boasts, surely we are nearing the end of United News &amp; Media's grip on the Daily Express. No one can be fooled any longer. The for-sale sign is up at Ludgate House: the Daily and Sunday Express and the Daily Star are available. Companies that want to keep a business do not enter into serious talks with people wishing to buy it. They do not open their books for them. They do not, having received a bid, then suggest a sum that would satisfy them. Nor, if they really wish to grow the business, do they allow it to dangle in limbo, showing the minimum of interest in its problems and undermining staff morale. When the time comes to assess the Express stewardship of United's chief executive Clive Hollick, this tawdry end to his reign will overshadow his sincere attempts to make it work at the beginning. Indeed, if Hollick doesn't sell soon at a reasonable price to buyers willing to take on Fleet Street's biggest basket case, he may well merit the dubious title of the worst proprietor in modern press history (and that includes Robert Maxwell). Express Newspapers is the only media group that is going down in price with every passing year. Now the reason has become crystal clear. The papers don't make any money. Without revenue from the printing outfits, such as West Ferry, the company would be insolvent. Over the years, stretching back through Hollick's time into the regime of David Stevens, the once mighty Beaverbrook empire has been disembowelled. Assets have been ruthlessly stripped so that the paper once published from Fleet Street's finest building now finds itself a tenant in its Blackfriars editorial base. Absurdly, if cunningly, the papers' online manifestations have been detached to form a separate United division, Xilerate, which is not part of the sale. What the Barclay brothers are therefore trying to buy is just part of the entity that should form a newspaper group. No wonder their latest offer is so low. Does anyone seriously believe that the purchase price of a company with a turnover of \u00a3250m is going to reach \u00a3200m? So let's try to make some sense out of this mess. Frederick and David Barclay, through their Press Holdings group and its publisher, Andrew Neil, have been trying to buy Express Newspapers for about 18 months. Other possible buyers, such as Trinity-Mirror and Independent Newspapers, have turned their backs on the idea. Since the Express titles do not make a profit, the monopolies problem would probably vanish, but neither has shown any real interest. Mohamed Al Fayed has been mentioned as a potential bidder but there is a big question mark over whether he has the money, or the will, to match his supposed ambition. Though Hollick is known to be furious about the public revelation of the Barclays' bid, because it contradicts all the official denials that the papers are not for sale, the publicity might just flush out other hopeful buyers. For the moment, though, the only game in town is being played by the Barclays. They have bid at least \u00a375m, but it isn't their final offer: they will pay what the company is worth. By chance, they have a first-class idea about its current value. Obligingly for the Barclays and embarrassingly for Hollick, United's own broker, Merrill Lynch, has published a report suggesting it lies in the range of \u00a374m to \u00a3105m. If that is so, then United's board, if it wishes to satisfy the company's shareholders, should be entertaining the Barclays to lunch. The subsidised canteen has long gone, but the dining rooms on the top floor still turn out reasonable meals at \u00a325 a head. While United's directors ponder, Neil's team has asked United's merchant bank, Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, to explain why they should pay more. \"It isn't a vanity purchase,\" says one of the Barclays' executives. \"We will pay what it is worth.\" Merrill Lynch, by the way, are not totally disinterested analysts.

Scorning Conservative plans to scrap Labour's tax breaks for the working poor in favour of a married couple's allowance, Mr Brown will unveil plans for extra money, additional childcare places and more flexible jobs to raise the proportion of lone parents in work to American levels. \"We want to see a sea change in the opportunities available to lone parents,\" he will say in Bristol at the launch of the Treasury's pre-budget report consultation period, which will lead to extra assistance for poorer families in next spring's Budget. \"We want to give lone parents real choices, enabling them to move from welfare to work and out of poverty.\" Five of Britain's leading firms - Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, Sainsbury, Direct Line and Granada - have agreed to be the trailblazers for the scheme designed to tempt lone parents back into the labour market with family-friendly working practices.

Mr Brown's aides made it clear yesterday that new measures for lone parents were high on the agenda for next month's pre-budget statement.

The programmes - made by Richard Copans and Stan Neumann - are built around lengthy interviews with the writer. You can guess how long the conversational process was by the rate at which Mailer changes locations and, above all, shirts. You sometimes feel that a subliminal leisurewear commercial is being screened. The author's opinions and reminiscences are split by archive film from American history and Mailer's own frequent appearances before the cameras. </p> <p>Oh, My America belongs to the somewhat intermittent television genre of the authored documentary. Most associated with James Cameron and then John Pilger, these opinionated films have tended to trouble executives in Britain because of institutional and legal requirements for balance in reporting. Under Thatcherism, this tension about self-expression reached a peak at the BBC and it was Channel 4 - with Gore Vidal and then his intellectual heir Christopher Hitchens - which most explored the form. Even so, it's still noticeable that - with occasional expections such as Fergal Keane's Forgotten Britain - the sound-off projects tend to concentrate on foreign subjects, where the terror of bias is less. </p> <p>But the success of authored documentaries inevitably depends on who the author is. And Norman Mailer was born for this format. The geographical size and political significance of America give its writers the weight of sages. It's very difficult for British novelists to be oracular: JG Ballard perhaps comes closest but his perspective is semi-American. </p> <p>Contemporary US letters has produced two great poet-pundits - Mailer and Gore Vidal - who, though differing wildly in such matters as the quantity of wives (6-0 to Norman), are two sides of the same dollar. Both have run for political office. Both, while writing shelves of novels, have flourished in the form of the essay. </p> <p>Their long mutual hostility may be explained by the realisation that they are fighting for the same prize: the ultimate summing-up of 20th century America. Seeing these Mailer films - after Vidal's various documentaries on the presidency - it's tempting to fantasise about a head-to-head television debate between the writers in the presidential campaign fashion: \"Mr Mailer, your two minutes on the moon landing is up. Mr Vidal, you have one minute for rebuttal.\" Norman vs Gore would provide in eloquence, intelligence and radical ideas everything that Gore v Bush has lacked with the added thrilling possibility that rebuttal might lead to head-buttal. </p> <p>These two programmes are a glorious warm-up by Mailer for such a bout. The authored documentary most depends on provocative opinions and freshly-made phrases and here the writer provides both. Ronald Reagan \"truly loved America - which was possibly the only sincere thing about him.\" The nation would have been a better place if Bobby Kennedy had been elected President. Richard Nixon must be regarded as a \"political genius\" because he was \"a man with an unpleasant personality who got the highest electoral vote of any president ever\". The problem with much political writing is that \"you can never do good writing simply because you dislike something\". You wind him up and he winds us up. </p> <p>But too many opinionated films can feel like displaced radio because the pictures lack the kick of the words. Here the programme-makers benefit from the size of Mailer's visual archive which includes Pennebaker's famous Town Bloody Hall, in which the writer debates with Germaine Greer and others. There's also a squirming appearance on American breakfast television after the New York Times has called Ancient Evenings a \"disaster\". But Copans and Neumann have also found more surprising illustration including a CIA recruitment video and footage of the Cold War Museum in Arizona. </p> <p>What keeps us here, though, is the Mailer voice: informed and authoritative but also teasing and cheeky. There's only one cheap moment - when the film cuts from Mailer's reference to his penis to footage of an Apollo rocket soaring towards orbit -and the only regret is that Mailer's political retrospective pulls out before Clinton. But the author is a canny negotiator - who has needed to find vast quantities of alimony and child support in recent times - and may well see Clinton as a separate series. If so, it's one that Copans and Neumann should rush to make. </p> <p>\u0095 Storyville - Oh My America,Wednesday &amp; Thursday, 11.20pm, BBC2</p>",

Milton's wife, Yeats's sisters. And woe betide the pram in the hall, Cyril Connolly's iconic enemy of promise. Any mothering that went on was to be directed at the fragile psyche of the artistic male. And what if the women, too, had creative aspirations? Consider Lily Briscoe in Virginia Woolf's To The Lighthouse, struggling to paint, yet preoccupied by her own inadequacy, her insignificance, keeping house for her father, Mr Tamsley whispering in her ear: \"Women can't paint, women can't write.\" Why did they do it, the wailing chorus of martyrs, the sacrificers of self; were they the victims of bullies or were they simply masochists? Or did they use their apparent servitude as an excuse for declining to engage with the responsibility of their own lives' potential? When, in fact, does supportiveness become subjugation?

Come in Martin O'Neill, or even better Joe Kinnear, England needs you.\"</p> <p>Unsurprisingly there's no groundswell of support for Joe Kinnear. Well not yet, anyway.

That's what Peter Bond thinks. And before you ask, he's from Scotland. \"English football, the fans, the media, the commentators, and England MUST get a reality check,\" he writes. \"England have beaten only two world class teams in competitive matches since they won the World Cup in 1966 -- Holland in Euro 1996 and France in Spain 1982. Find me another world class team they have beaten in that period (i.e. a team capable at the time of winning the tournament) and I'll eat my words. </p> <p>\"That record in international football is not grounds for the unrealistic expectation and hype that surrounds the English game. All major European and South American nations have a better record in competitive international football than England,\" he adds, failing to mention exactly how many world-class teams Scotland have beaten in the same period.</p>",

And before you ask, he's from Scotland. \"English football, the fans, the media, the commentators, and England MUST get a reality check,\" he writes. \"England have beaten only two world class teams in competitive matches since they won the World Cup in 1966 -- Holland in Euro 1996 and France in Spain 1982. Find me another world class team they have beaten in that period (i.e. a team capable at the time of winning the tournament) and I'll eat my words. \"That record in international football is not grounds for the unrealistic expectation and hype that surrounds the English game. All major European and South American nations have a better record in competitive international football than England,\" he adds, failing to mention exactly how many world-class teams Scotland have beaten in the same period.",

Said site contains a thinly veiled attack on the shadow home secretary's brave stand against that hardcore criminal element, cannabis smokers, under the headline \"Widdecombe you hilarious clown\".

Asked about his favourite websites, Kelly named expectingrain.com and woolyrockstars.com. Pernickety readers, i.e. those that go through absolutely everything with a fine-tooth comb, immediately pointed out that the latter website does not in fact exist. More importantly neither the .com or the .co.uk domain names for Woolyrockstars have been registered. Was Kelly making a mockery of us all or was he merely pointing out a new market niche? Kelly says neither: \"I'm very much afraid this thing does exist. The url, however, is woollyrockers.com. Check it out!!\" Duh! Monkey did and fell in love with the Bee Gees doll. Could Kelly have created a monster? </p> <p><strong>Minutes matter</strong><br>What's this? The BBC's famously impartial news reporting standards slipping over its own 10pm news bulletin announcement? The Monkey has got its paws on an internal email from BBC Online producer James Thornet that was sent round after the news broke to BBC online hacks out in the sticks. He draws his colleagues' attention to the fact that the switch to 10pm means the regional bulletin tacked on at the end of the proper, grown-up news will be extended to a massive six-and-a-half minutes. \"We must put this story at the top of online news stories asap,\" says the excitable Thornett. Is he worried viewers in the regions wouldn't notice the difference otherwise? </p> <p><strong>Only slimline warriors need apply</strong><br> Monkey has received an email from Rainbow network, home of Xena fans (see proud to portly, below), anxious to set the record straight. \"Firstly, the generosity of Channel 5 in offering Rainbow a box of T-shirts goes without saying - we were delighted to receive them, and we had loads of entrants to the competition in which they were the prize. On opening the eagerly awaited box of goodies, however, we could tell straight away that there was no way, with the best will in the world, anyone other than a small teenager or large Teddy bear was going to be able to get into them.<br> We closed the competition as images of irate readers struggling to get an arm in a size 6 garment sprang to mind. As Tamara, the Xena co-ordinator at Channel 5, said: 'Annoyingly our merchandise person fits these and didn't consider the more womanly figure, ie me.' We're with you, Tamara! <br>Some lucky winners did decide to hang on to their prizes, although we still have 35 or so here in the Rainbow office. Send us your address and we'll happily send you one.\" Monkey is unsure about being compared to a large teddy bear, but may well have to take up Rainbow's kind offer in the spirit of investigation. </p> <p><br> <br> <strong>Sticky gimmicks</strong><br> Monkey was amused to discover an overflowing pot of honey in the post today. The honey pot subsequently attacked all surrounding computers and made everything in the office sticky. Eugh. The penny finally dropped when Monkey found the attached (and at this point very sticky) note, saying that eBay was stickier than QXL. Point taken. But did it really have to destroy my workspace to tell me that? <br> <br> <strong>Clash of the dot.com giants</strong><br> Plunging dot.com stock prices are nothing new, but the long-term ramifications are starting to impact heavily on those big boys we call Amazon and eBay. Rumours have started to surface about a mooted merger between the two e-commerce giants, which have both been rocked by the recent downturn in dot.com fortunes. A tie-up would make sense, particularly for Amazon, which is struggling to convince investors of its long-term earnings. Perhaps it should take a leaf from eBay's gimmick book and start sending out plants and pots of bottled Amazon river water to prove to investors that Amazon can make things grow. Just a (naff) suggestion. <br> <br> <strong>Proud to portly</strong><br> Channel 5 kindly sent 50 of its finest Xena, Warrior Princess T-shirts to the gay and lesbian website Rainbownetwork.com for a competition giveaway, on account of the pigtailed one being terribly popular with the target audience. Channel 5 was staggered, then, when Rainbow very apologetically sent them all back. It seems the T-shirts are of the cropped belly button-baring variety and, after a bit of market research in the office, Rainbow discovered they were too petite for its users. Seems a shame to let them go to waste, so Monkey is happy to try to squeeze into one to show support. <br> <br> <strong>Bad taste sensation</strong><br> GMTV managing director Christopher Stoddart is so concerned about reports of tasteless office banter that he has issued an email to all staff reminding them of the company's equal opportunities policy. In a carefully worded memo, he also reminded staff of the company's grievance procedure and told them that they mustn't feel frightened of whistle-blowing on their bosses. \"From time to time we will be drawing your attention to important company policies which we all need to follow. Our equal opportunities policy is particularly important because its scope is both on-screen and off-screen,\" he wrote. \"Should any employee have a complaint under this policy [or for any other reason] he should feel free to raise the matter.\" He continued: \"If it concerns their line manager, then they may wish to consult personnel.\" Who on earth has prompted this and what on earth did he or she say?

A few weeks ago top Sunday Biz hack Richard Northedge wrote a coruscating profile of some suit or other doing something fantastically important in the City. Two weeks later a frighteningly similar article (exactly the same except for two small amendments) appeared in the Scotsman's revamped business section, albeit under a different byline. Perhaps Northedge should sue for plagiarism. But then the ed-in-chief of the pink Sunday is one Andrew Neil, who is also in charge of the Scotsman.

      "body": "<p>Caroline Aherne was besieged with frantic calls last Wednesday. The Radio Times desperately needed to photograph her as Denise Royle with new baby David as they scrambled to pull together a new front cover in a matter of hours. </p> <p>The BBC's decision to rush forward the switch of its news to 10pm on October 16 and stuff the first week's schedule with their (too few) hit shows such as the Royle Family sent massive shock waves in every direction. </p> <p>\"This is war,\" announced a grim Clive Jones, chief executive of Carlton Television, as ITV responded by ruthlessly targeting the new 10pm News. \"I find their arrogance breathtaking.\" </p> <p>\"It's like dinosaurs taking lumps out of each other,\" said Channel 4's chief scheduler, Rosemary Newell, as every network plotted revenge. Over at Sky, jokes about the \"clay footed\" BBC were replaced with respect, as Sky One gleefully fell on the task of targeting 10pm. </p> <p>Ominously, last Tuesday's stunning announcement created a rare moment as politicians, desperate to ensure a choice of prime news outlets, united across party divides in fury: Chris Smith, Peter Ainsworth (Conservative shadow media spokesman) and Norman Baker (Liberal Democrats) uniformly condemned the move and questioned how this action could possibly constitute public-service broadcasting. </p> <p>\"I am hearing enormous political anger,\" said a top broadcasting regulator from the Tory party conference. </p> <p>More to the point, Tony Blair's weekend red box reportedly contained the draft communications white paper to streamline regulation. Nemesis is at hand. The BBC governors will lose their special \"judge and jury\" status, demoted to Channel 4-style directors, answerable to an external regulator. </p> <p>As the BBC's critics pointed out gloatingly, the introduction of statute (in the shape of a new communica tions act) can trump even the corporation's Royal Charter. But at a government seminar over the summer chairman Sir Christopher Bland had already virtually conceded the ground. </p> <p>\"My view is that the BBC knew the battle to keep the governors was already lost and decided to get on with more important things, like holding its audience,\" says a former BBC adviser. </p> <p>Yet Chris Smith is not just another licence fee payer. The BBC requires his permission to see through its next phase of digital expansion: to launch two new children's services, revamp Choice and Knowledge as BBC3 and BBC4, and run five new digital radio stations. It is also consulting over ambitious plans for a digital educational network which will take it right into commercial territory. </p> <p>Michael Jackson, chief executive of Channel 4, speaks for the entire commercial sector: \"We need an independent regulator, that gen uinely harmonises things like the provision of news. This is a dog's dinner.\" The BBC should be tied, as Channel 4 is, to a clear statement of promises, he says. </p> <p>Clive Jones adds: \"When ITV wanted to move its news, it had an extensive period of consultation, a trial period, then a painful formula to reinstate news. The BBC had none of this. It is acting on a belief that it will be proved right, though we know it is really all about ratings.\" </p> <p>Even events in the wider world conspired to question the BBC's move. The fall of Slobodan Milosevic as the people of Serbia marched last Thursday was perfectly suited for the BBC's Nine O'Clock News. Under the new arrangements homes without rolling news - the majority - would have had no real update till 10 pm. </p> <p>Dyke's bold ploy took root on Friday morning, September 22, after the independent television commission (ITC) struck its deal with ITV for a return of News at Ten three or four nights a week. Before jetting off to the Olympics he asked Tony Hall and Mark Thompson, respectively director of BBC news and television, to see which was the first week when the news could be shifted from 9pm. </p> <p>He came back to the answer: the week of October 16. Hall says he was encouraged by David Liddiment's refusal to revive the name News at Ten. But the truth is that every half-hearted move in ITV's half-hearted plans gave Dyke the fig leaf he needed. \"The trouble with the ITC deal was that by day two it started to be unpicked, allowing BBC1 to justify its superior provision,\" observes Jackson. </p> <p>All that remained was for Dyke to gain permission from an emergency meeting of governors last Monday. Sir Christopher Bland, an odd chameleon figure who adjusts his behaviour according to the style of his director-general, went around the table, putting the spotlight on each governor individually - yes or no. There was never really any doubt. The governors recruited Dyke for his gung-ho quality and on this matter, it was back him - or else. </p> <p>Michael Jackson, a former BBC director of television, observes there is a Dyke factor at work here, revelling in sailing close to the wind and being everything John Birt was not. The sheer speed of the BBC's action prevented political opposition growing. \"Good for them,\" says Jackson. \"Greg really does put two fingers up to the government and Chris Smith in particular. There's a real sense that because of the [generous] nature of the licence fee settlement [which is index-linked until 2006] the BBC can do as it wants, without reference to politicians. Whatever one thinks of that, we're seeing at the moment a dysfunctional relationship between the two.\" </p> <p>ITV's council meeting - where big decisions are thrashed out - also took place last Tuesday as the move was confirmed. The network's power brokers decided not to rush forward News at Ten plans to trump the BBC - though ITN would have loved to be asked, and Granada was initially keen. </p> <p>Simply holding firm is not really an option for the network, however. The run up to Christmas is ITV's most critical revenue period. The network's owners know that the move is designed to take audiences away from them between 9pm and 10pm as the BBC puts out its best programmes, and ramps up investment. </p> <p>\"We will throw everything we can against the BBC between 9pm and 11pm, to hold onto viewers and cut the appeal of News at Ten,\" vows Jones. \"Every drama, every entertainment show, every event we can lay our hands on. Peak Practice, Fat Friends, movies on Friday nights, the lot. </p> <p>\"This is a very clear betrayal of the BBC's public service values. What they are doing is not in the interests of viewers. Nor do they have carte blanche to target the commercial sector.\" It is likely ITV's resurrection of News at Ten will not now happen: relaunch at the end of January is fading by the day, though the ITC still thinks the deal stands. </p> <p>Patricia Hodgson's stitched together deal - with the attractions of news on the main channels at 6pm, 6.30pm, 7pm, 9 pm and 10 pm (four nights), plus Channel 5 bulletins - seems a pipedream. Her power, given such a shot in the arm by her apparent victory just three weeks ago, is dented. </p> <p>Jones says: \"We have no real desire to go head to head with them, [but] we are not going to take any precipitate action.\" ITV will reopen talks with the ITC at some point after the BBC moves. The argument will be that two programmes at 10pm will halve news audiences. </p> <p>ITV executives' gameplan is to embarrass the BBC over the long term, perhaps even into moving back to 9pm. They are studying Bland's comments on Channel 4 News last Tuesday when he speculated that this could happen if audiences plummet. </p> <p>They also know that the BBC (as it privately admits) is under huge pressure because it does not have a sufficient stockpile of top-rating programmes to support its ambitions after the first big blaze up to Christmas. Already, dramas like Take a Girl Like You, originally destined for Sunday night, are to be parachuted into the 9pm weekday slot. Also, many recent drama series such as Badger, Border Cafe, Dirty Work and Fish have flopped. </p> <p>It is also clear from the first week's schedules that there is a lot of stretching going on: the few live programmes - Watchdog and Crimewatch - are being told to run for an extra five to 10 minutes, to bring 50-minute dramas and other pieces up to the hour, says Mark Thompson. </p> <p>He concedes that a fourth episode of EastEnders is now a \"possibility\" (for which, read \"certainty\"). </p> <p>With all the treats and big name feature films being lined up for the first week of the new schedule, viewers may well initially think it's Christmas. Certainly, BBC1's first week looks like Christmas (or an American network): it has no serious documentaries, current affairs or arts in weekday primetime. </p> <p>Panorama has been dumped on Sundays at 10.15 pm, a slot to suit its 2-3m audience, when, as Jackson observes, BBC1 current affairs needs to be reinvented. \"God slot\" strands like Everyman - the show that Panorama replaces - will be shoe-horned in somewhere in the week, after the news. </p> <p>Tony Hall, BBC director of News, says the important thing is that Panorama remains on BBC1 (the governors did put their foot down over a shift to BBC2) and that there were precious few other slots. The series is still seeking an editor. Meanwhile, ITV, with its commitment to running Tonight with Trevor McDonald at 10pm, looks like the channel with a commitment to current affairs. </p> <p> The move also has huge repercussions for BBC2, and its relationship with BBC1, way beyond losing choice programmes such as Have I Got News For You?. The Friday night comedy zone is being turned into the History zone. Instead, BBC1 will have two comedy zones, on Mondays and Fridays between 9pm and 10pm. </p> <p>And there are other clear winners and losers. Channel 4 promises to target 10pm (where it already schedules ER and Ally McBeal) with even greater vigour. Newell says, \"nothing is out of the question. We will be making changes, but not from the first week.\" Most dramatically, it might even move Channel 4 News to 8pm. </p> <p>Advertisers clearly face a \"serious problem\". Zenith Media's Adam Smith warns that ITV's audiences will shrink. \"That is most unusual for commercial audiences, as the public service network grows. They will have to spend more to get the same level of exposure.\" </p> <p>Yet, Dyke's claim that the BBC is moving the news to boost news audiences is met with universal disbelief in adland. Hall says it's really a case of holding and stemming further decline, now running at around 4% a year (after a period of 8%), rather than actually increasing viewers. </p> <p>The figures tell the story. In the year to June 2000, BBC1 gained an average of 5.7m adult viewers between 8pm and 11pm, while ITV had 7m. With a clear run of entertainment this could even out eventually. However, at 10pm, the total TV audience is around 20m, 2m less people than at 9pm. At best a quarter, some 5m, might remain with BBC1 news, compared to the average of 5.3m so far this year for the Nine O'Clock News. </p> <p>Thompson says: \"If the organisation cannot move swiftly, it will not survive\". If BBC news audiences do not thrive, it's hard to see Dyke surviving.</p>",

The series is still seeking an editor. Meanwhile, ITV, with its commitment to running Tonight with Trevor McDonald at 10pm, looks like the channel with a commitment to current affairs. The move also has huge repercussions for BBC2, and its relationship with BBC1, way beyond losing choice programmes such as Have I Got News For You?. The Friday night comedy zone is being turned into the History zone. Instead, BBC1 will have two comedy zones, on Mondays and Fridays between 9pm and 10pm. And there are other clear winners and losers. Channel 4 promises to target 10pm (where it already schedules ER and Ally McBeal) with even greater vigour. Newell says, \"nothing is out of the question. We will be making changes, but not from the first week.\" Most dramatically, it might even move Channel 4 News to 8pm. Advertisers clearly face a \"serious problem\". Zenith Media's Adam Smith warns that ITV's audiences will shrink. \"That is most unusual for commercial audiences, as the public service network grows. They will have to spend more to get the same level of exposure.\" Yet, Dyke's claim that the BBC is moving the news to boost news audiences is met with universal disbelief in adland. Hall says it's really a case of holding and stemming further decline, now running at around 4% a year (after a period of 8%), rather than actually increasing viewers. The figures tell the story. In the year to June 2000, BBC1 gained an average of 5.7m adult viewers between 8pm and 11pm, while ITV had 7m. With a clear run of entertainment this could even out eventually. However, at 10pm, the total TV audience is around 20m, 2m less people than at 9pm. At best a quarter, some 5m, might remain with BBC1 news, compared to the average of 5.3m so far this year for the Nine O'Clock News. Thompson says: \"If the organisation cannot move swiftly, it will not survive\". If BBC news audiences do not thrive, it's hard to see Dyke surviving.",

It has interests in sports TV production, sponsorship and events marketing and this year boosted its size through a series of acquisitions.</p> <p>Chief executive Geoff Brown spoke to MediaGuardian on the day Sportsworld announced preliminary pre-tax profits for the year of \u00a32.7m, against \u00a31.3m last year. Turnover soared by \u00a315m to \u00a320.7m, on the back of some canny acquisitions in the Asia Pacific.</p> <p>MediaGuardian's <strong>Dan Milmo</strong>: \"What were the key factors behind today's results?\"</p> <p><strong>Mr Brown</strong>: \"It's down to a combination of strong organic growth and acquisitions. Our purchases have bedded down more quickly than we expected. Australia Media Holdings and Sports &amp; Outdoor Media International have performed well. We have integrated them quickly and they have settled into the group.\"</p> <p><strong>DM</strong>: \"Given that the acquisitions have done so well for the company so far, do you plan more next year?\"</p> <p><strong>GB</strong>: \"It's an extremely fragmented market, and a big one.

      "bodyText": "Sportsworld Media is enjoying the never-ending boom in sports broadcasting. It has interests in sports TV production, sponsorship and events marketing and this year boosted its size through a series of acquisitions. Chief executive Geoff Brown spoke to MediaGuardian on the day Sportsworld announced preliminary pre-tax profits for the year of \u00a32.7m, against \u00a31.3m last year. Turnover soared by \u00a315m to \u00a320.7m, on the back of some canny acquisitions in the Asia Pacific. MediaGuardian's Dan Milmo: \"What were the key factors behind today's results?\" Mr Brown: \"It's down to a combination of strong organic growth and acquisitions. Our purchases have bedded down more quickly than we expected. Australia Media Holdings and Sports &amp; Outdoor Media International have performed well. We have integrated them quickly and they have settled into the group.\" DM: \"Given that the acquisitions have done so well for the company so far, do you plan more next year?\" GB: \"It's an extremely fragmented market, and a big one. There are a lot of acquisitions that have come to us, and we are reviewing them now. We have identified the right criteria for a good purchase. We expect to be making more acquisitions during the course of the year, as we are so good at knitting in these companies and bedding them down.\" DM: \"With turnover up nearly 75%, are you not setting yourself impossible targets for next year's results?\" GB: \"We clearly don't want to overstate ourselves, but analysts have projected our earnings for the next year, and we are very comfortable with them.\" DM: \"How well-placed are you in the sports broadcast market?\" GB: \"There is a very significant shift in the marketing and spending of advertisers, which are moving into sports events sponsorship.

      "body": "<p>After last week's \u00a31.5m opening, Billy Elliot has moved to the top of the UK box office, ahead of Eddie Murphy's Nutty Professor II: The Klumps. The picture is a triumph for Working Title and its low-budget unit WT2, Tiger Aspect Pictures, BBC Films, Universal and its new speciality arm Universal Focus, France's StudioCanal, and the UK's maligned lottery funding system.</p> <p>There haven't been so many firsts and breakthroughs bound up in a single British picture since Four Weddings lit the way out of the British film industry's early 90s gloom, virtually inventing Working Title, Polygram Filmed Entertainment, FilmFour, producer Duncan Kenworthy, screenwriter Richard Curtis and actor Hugh Grant in the process.</p> <p>Meanwhile, X-Men has passed the $100m mark overseas - the special effects-laden blockbuster has now hauled in $104m worldwide. </p> <p>Over in the US, funny guy Robert De Niro helped to give the box-office one of its best weekends for many weeks. De Niro is currently starring in the betrothal comedy Meet the Parents, a farce about a jittery prospective son-in-law (Ben Stiller) and his girlfriend's hard-nosed, overprotective father (De Niro). Meet the Parents debuted as the weekend's top film, taking $29.1m, according to studio estimates last night. </p> <p>At almost $30m, this represents a record weekend for a US October opening, beating the $17.2m taken in by Antz two years ago. This was also a personal best for both De Niro and Stiller. Denzel Washington's football-coaching flick Remember the Titans, last weekend's top film, held solidly at second place. The Sylvester Stallone remake of Get Carter, opened in the third spot.</p>",

      "bodyText": "After last week's \u00a31.5m opening, Billy Elliot has moved to the top of the UK box office, ahead of Eddie Murphy's Nutty Professor II: The Klumps. The picture is a triumph for Working Title and its low-budget unit WT2, Tiger Aspect Pictures, BBC Films, Universal and its new speciality arm Universal Focus, France's StudioCanal, and the UK's maligned lottery funding system. There haven't been so many firsts and breakthroughs bound up in a single British picture since Four Weddings lit the way out of the British film industry's early 90s gloom, virtually inventing Working Title, Polygram Filmed Entertainment, FilmFour, producer Duncan Kenworthy, screenwriter Richard Curtis and actor Hugh Grant in the process. Meanwhile, X-Men has passed the $100m mark overseas - the special effects-laden blockbuster has now hauled in $104m worldwide. Over in the US, funny guy Robert De Niro helped to give the box-office one of its best weekends for many weeks. De Niro is currently starring in the betrothal comedy Meet the Parents, a farce about a jittery prospective son-in-law (Ben Stiller) and his girlfriend's hard-nosed, overprotective father (De Niro). Meet the Parents debuted as the weekend's top film, taking $29.1m, according to studio estimates last night. At almost $30m, this represents a record weekend for a US October opening, beating the $17.2m taken in by Antz two years ago. This was also a personal best for both De Niro and Stiller. Denzel Washington's football-coaching flick Remember the Titans, last weekend's top film, held solidly at second place. The Sylvester Stallone remake of Get Carter, opened in the third spot.",

(The general idea of labour-saving technology is to get jobs done faster. But, as everyone knows, the really cool and properly satisfying thing is to see something happen automatically but slowly.

Peugeot understand this. The 607 wants to relieve you of driving's most onerous chores. Switching on the lights, for instance. Headlights come on automatically when the car decides there isn't enough natural light about. The hazard lights will come on automatically when you brake sharply, leaving you free to concentrate on the slightly more urgent matter of doing the braking. (A smart idea, that. There have been a number of occasions I can recall during sudden traffic build-ups on motorways when, fumbling along the dashboard for the hazard button in order to let people behind know that I am slowing down pronto, I have almost forgotten to slow down pronto.) </p> <p>What's more, the windscreen wipers work automatically, as do the headlamp washers. The air conditioning automatically adjusts itself and so does the volume of the hi-fi, according to the noise of the engine. When you lock the car the wing mirrors automatically fold away.

There's a radar at the back that sounds to let you know when you're risking your paintwork. In a moment of executive fat-headedness, I chose to ignore the radar's judgment during a basic reverse parking manoeuvre. This was not especially clever - though, in fairness to myself, I should point out that the radar had earned some scepticism from me by beeping urgently whenever I reversed off my drive. The slope of the drive, combined with the camber of the road, meant the sensors, which are strung along the bumper, were locking on to the surface of the road and informing me that there was tarmac in the way. </p> <p>Also, what would Michael Schumacher be likely to trust: potentially fallible technology or his fastidiously disciplined naked eye? During this later parking manoeuvre, which took place on level ground, the radar's beeping rapidly quickened to a continuous tone. I would not like to be forced to review video footage of my complacently smiling expression as, in the midst of this shrilling alarm, I turned to my mildly anxious passenger and said, \"Ridiculous device! I've got yards.\" Emerging from the car, I saw that I had parked with the bumper actually resting on top of the vehicle directly behind. Still, no damage.

He was Lynch's first choice for the role, but he was scheduled to have hip replacement surgery, and was using a cane when the casting call came.

He left school at 15 during the Depression, and worked as a stable boy at a polo barn, where many actors played in their leisure time. In 1937, two men from MGM came looking for horses, and for someone who could ride them, for The Marx Brothers' movie, A Day At The Races.

      "body": "<p>As documentaries about rail disasters collided head-on on Channels 4 and 5 last Monday night, the governors of the BBC were unanimously deciding to aim their main evening news bulletin squarely at ITV's Nightly News, parked unconvincingly in the 10pm slot precisely in order to block the BBC's intended move there. </p> <p>If one collision was the kind of scheduling accident that occasionally happens, the news clash is malice aforethought. ITV had squirmed for months to avoid re-instating News At Ten, in the face of intense pressure from the ITC. There was little enthusiasm for the compromise of leaving the half-hour bulletin at 6.30pm, and bringing the 20-minute bulletin forward half an hour to 10.30pm. </p> <p>ITV played for time by threatening a judicial review of the ITC's order to change its schedule. It was the Guardian Edinburgh International Television Festival at the end of August that triggered the fateful sequence of events. Greg Dyke - the new BBC director-general - could not resist using the platform of the keynote MacTaggart Lecture to announce the BBC's intention to move its main news from 9pm to 10pm next autumn. That weekend, Patricia Hodgson - about to take over as the ITC's chief executive - and Charles Allen - celebrating Granada's triumph in the ITV merger battle - both signalled a willingness to do a deal before they ended up in court. The 10.30pm option was now dead: killed by the prospect of a BBC news bulletin immediately beforehand. </p> <p>Whilst Dyke was savouring at first hand in Sydney the delights of the BBC's Olympics exclusivity, ITV and the ITC tried for a pre-emptive strike. The Nightly News would move forward an hour from 11pm, on three or four weekdays each week. This was a transparent attempt to spike the BBC's guns. Why Friday should be regarded as different from other weekdays was inexplicable. The ambiguity over a fourth night - allowing ITV to bump the news whenever it wanted to play long-form drama or a movie across the 10pm junction - was inexcusable. And leaving the regional news to dangle in isolation sometime after 11pm was indefensible. Granada even had the last-minute cheek to ask for 6% extra advertising in peak-time as \"compensation\": which the ITC granted without any consultation, much to the fury of Channel 4 in particular. </p> <p>The BBC scornfully dismissed this convoluted arrangement: and it became clear that ITV had miscalculated. If it had even committed to four nights at 10pm, the BBC would have struggled to justify competing head-to-head, as its chairman, Sir Christopher Bland, conceded to a BBC interviewer. But a three-night clash was tolera ble: with a speed and ruthlessness which many commentators applauded, the BBC shot ITV's fox. Its bulletin would move to 10pm on all nights but Saturday, from October 16. </p> <p>For the best part of three months, the BBC will enjoy solo flights in the preferred slot. In order to entrench viewing habits, it is pressing hard on the ratings accelerator. In the first week of the new schedule, its two most successful comedies - One Foot in the Grave and The Royle Family - will run back-to-back at 9pm on Monday, a blockbuster film - Men In Black - will take the 8.30pm slot on Tuesday, and Have I Got News For You? will transfer from BBC2 on Friday. But these tactics smell more of desperation than design. </p> <p>After all, BBC1 has only two or three blockbuster films to show in an entire year. One Foot In The Grave is in its last season, and Men Behaving Badly has already finished. The original intention of moving the news next autumn was based on the need to build a backlog of material capable of sustaining the 9pm hour. Dramas written at 50-minute length leave too many odd ends to fill. On the Thursday of the first week of the new schedule, EastEnders is starting at 7.35pm (so running into the start of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?), pushing Holby City to 8.05pm so as to allow Hope And Glory to start at 9.05pm. As Hope And Glory captured only a 19% share in its 9.35pm slot last week (and was even beaten by the excellent Simon Schama on BBC2), it is hard to believe it will do better than the news at the earlier time, especially starting five minutes after every other 9pm show. </p> <p>The last time the BBC moved its evening news, by 10 minutes, months were spent in detailed preparation. Now, in order to wrong-foot ITV, a far bigger change is being implemented at breakneck speed. The reasons being offered are pure humbug. The chairman argued that if a change made sense next year, it also made sense this year - seemingly oblivious to the painful gaps in the ITV schedule that resulted from dropping News At Ten at too short notice. He continued to argue that the news would do better at 10pm than it would have done at 9pm - a weasel-worded formulation that takes a step back from Greg Dyke's forthright MacTaggart pledge that the actual number of news viewers would increase (itself a wholly unbelievable pledge - BBC1 would have to win an impossible 33% share at 10pm to maintain the size of audience for news at 9pm, when there are far more people available to view). </p> <p>Better coverage of the US presidential elections was rolled out as an excuse - yet we will have just three weeks of such coverage after the move, and then must wait four years for any more! Those old stand-bys, the US markets and Commons divisions, were offered again: as if coverage of these is crucially affected by the later hour more than two or three times a year. </p> <p>We are entitled to honesty from the BBC. If they really believe that maintaining BBC1's audience share is more important than the exact placement of the news, just say so: it is a perfectly respectable argument. News viewing will decline, fewer schoolchildren will be able to watch at 10pm than at 9pm, and the combined audience for the BBC1 and ITV bulletins will drop precipitately on the nights they clash directly. But if the BBC is convinced that the future of its main channel depends upon moving the news, and that such a manoeuvre will be severely compromised if it occurs too late, then the risks involved in this dash for 10pm may be justified. Just give it to us straight. </p> <p>ITV must now wish it had not finessed the ITC so finely. It will have queasy memories of how the ITC's predecessor, the IBA, loftily delayed the launch of TV-am in 1983, to allow the recently launched Channel 4 some breathing space - only for the BBC to nip in with its own Breakfast News service. This effectively holed TV-am Mk1 below the waterline, leaving it to await eventual rescue by - yes! - the aforementioned Greg Dyke, and the late Bruce Gyngell. </p> <p> M eanwhile, Greg Dyke will at least be celebrating BBC1 climbing above the 30% level during the Olympics, comfortably beating ITV.

      "bodyText": "As documentaries about rail disasters collided head-on on Channels 4 and 5 last Monday night, the governors of the BBC were unanimously deciding to aim their main evening news bulletin squarely at ITV's Nightly News, parked unconvincingly in the 10pm slot precisely in order to block the BBC's intended move there. If one collision was the kind of scheduling accident that occasionally happens, the news clash is malice aforethought. ITV had squirmed for months to avoid re-instating News At Ten, in the face of intense pressure from the ITC. There was little enthusiasm for the compromise of leaving the half-hour bulletin at 6.30pm, and bringing the 20-minute bulletin forward half an hour to 10.30pm. ITV played for time by threatening a judicial review of the ITC's order to change its schedule. It was the Guardian Edinburgh International Television Festival at the end of August that triggered the fateful sequence of events. Greg Dyke - the new BBC director-general - could not resist using the platform of the keynote MacTaggart Lecture to announce the BBC's intention to move its main news from 9pm to 10pm next autumn. That weekend, Patricia Hodgson - about to take over as the ITC's chief executive - and Charles Allen - celebrating Granada's triumph in the ITV merger battle - both signalled a willingness to do a deal before they ended up in court. The 10.30pm option was now dead: killed by the prospect of a BBC news bulletin immediately beforehand. Whilst Dyke was savouring at first hand in Sydney the delights of the BBC's Olympics exclusivity, ITV and the ITC tried for a pre-emptive strike. The Nightly News would move forward an hour from 11pm, on three or four weekdays each week. This was a transparent attempt to spike the BBC's guns. Why Friday should be regarded as different from other weekdays was inexplicable. The ambiguity over a fourth night - allowing ITV to bump the news whenever it wanted to play long-form drama or a movie across the 10pm junction - was inexcusable. And leaving the regional news to dangle in isolation sometime after 11pm was indefensible. Granada even had the last-minute cheek to ask for 6% extra advertising in peak-time as \"compensation\": which the ITC granted without any consultation, much to the fury of Channel 4 in particular. The BBC scornfully dismissed this convoluted arrangement: and it became clear that ITV had miscalculated. If it had even committed to four nights at 10pm, the BBC would have struggled to justify competing head-to-head, as its chairman, Sir Christopher Bland, conceded to a BBC interviewer. But a three-night clash was tolera ble: with a speed and ruthlessness which many commentators applauded, the BBC shot ITV's fox. Its bulletin would move to 10pm on all nights but Saturday, from October 16. For the best part of three months, the BBC will enjoy solo flights in the preferred slot. In order to entrench viewing habits, it is pressing hard on the ratings accelerator. In the first week of the new schedule, its two most successful comedies - One Foot in the Grave and The Royle Family - will run back-to-back at 9pm on Monday, a blockbuster film - Men In Black - will take the 8.30pm slot on Tuesday, and Have I Got News For You? will transfer from BBC2 on Friday. But these tactics smell more of desperation than design. After all, BBC1 has only two or three blockbuster films to show in an entire year. One Foot In The Grave is in its last season, and Men Behaving Badly has already finished. The original intention of moving the news next autumn was based on the need to build a backlog of material capable of sustaining the 9pm hour. Dramas written at 50-minute length leave too many odd ends to fill. On the Thursday of the first week of the new schedule, EastEnders is starting at 7.35pm (so running into the start of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?), pushing Holby City to 8.05pm so as to allow Hope And Glory to start at 9.05pm. As Hope And Glory captured only a 19% share in its 9.35pm slot last week (and was even beaten by the excellent Simon Schama on BBC2), it is hard to believe it will do better than the news at the earlier time, especially starting five minutes after every other 9pm show. The last time the BBC moved its evening news, by 10 minutes, months were spent in detailed preparation. Now, in order to wrong-foot ITV, a far bigger change is being implemented at breakneck speed. The reasons being offered are pure humbug. The chairman argued that if a change made sense next year, it also made sense this year - seemingly oblivious to the painful gaps in the ITV schedule that resulted from dropping News At Ten at too short notice. He continued to argue that the news would do better at 10pm than it would have done at 9pm - a weasel-worded formulation that takes a step back from Greg Dyke's forthright MacTaggart pledge that the actual number of news viewers would increase (itself a wholly unbelievable pledge - BBC1 would have to win an impossible 33% share at 10pm to maintain the size of audience for news at 9pm, when there are far more people available to view). Better coverage of the US presidential elections was rolled out as an excuse - yet we will have just three weeks of such coverage after the move, and then must wait four years for any more! Those old stand-bys, the US markets and Commons divisions, were offered again: as if coverage of these is crucially affected by the later hour more than two or three times a year. We are entitled to honesty from the BBC. If they really believe that maintaining BBC1's audience share is more important than the exact placement of the news, just say so: it is a perfectly respectable argument. News viewing will decline, fewer schoolchildren will be able to watch at 10pm than at 9pm, and the combined audience for the BBC1 and ITV bulletins will drop precipitately on the nights they clash directly. But if the BBC is convinced that the future of its main channel depends upon moving the news, and that such a manoeuvre will be severely compromised if it occurs too late, then the risks involved in this dash for 10pm may be justified. Just give it to us straight. ITV must now wish it had not finessed the ITC so finely. It will have queasy memories of how the ITC's predecessor, the IBA, loftily delayed the launch of TV-am in 1983, to allow the recently launched Channel 4 some breathing space - only for the BBC to nip in with its own Breakfast News service. This effectively holed TV-am Mk1 below the waterline, leaving it to await eventual rescue by - yes! - the aforementioned Greg Dyke, and the late Bruce Gyngell. M eanwhile, Greg Dyke will at least be celebrating BBC1 climbing above the 30% level during the Olympics, comfortably beating ITV. But perhaps the rest of us will reflect that, for all the merits of the BBC's coverage, it offered us but an edited glimpse of the wealth of action on offer in Sydney. At least the host broadcaster, Network Seven, offered two channels of Olympics material. In the digital age, it is intolerable that - thanks to the iniquitous listed events rules - one broadcaster can bottle up all the material when it is technically and commercially possible for several digital pay-TV channels to offer parallel live coverage of many events, without undermining the coverage from a national free-to-air broadcaster. That, surely, is one clash of schedulers versus viewers that Chris Smith could sort out by 2004, even if he can only grind his teeth in frustration as ITV and the BBC, for their own selfish reasons, effectively collude in reducing choice and news viewing in peak time.",

Other ERP systems have been installed in Barcelona, Lisbon, Dallas, Oklahoma and Florida. </p> <p>Oslo has had a system in place since 1990 using electronic tags and beacons around the central business district.

The toll would take such users off the road and out of the lorry's way. A lorry journey time that is cut by 10 minutes would easily be worth the toll. Thus road pricing would cut companies' costs and make the economy work more efficiently. It would be a simple matter for a government to set tolls on lorries at a different level from those on cars. Why then do some road users say they are against congestion charging? It is because people do not realise, when answering opinion polls, that road tolls would clear the roads. After an experimental week of road tolls, Britain would never wish to go back to the jams of toll-free roads. Another criticism is that road pricing would hurt the poor. It would not. Sensible road tolls would be designed to be high at peak times. Those on high wages would travel then and pay for the privilege. People on low incomes could choose to travel at other times of the day when the tolls were low or even zero. Most people in the lowest fifth of income distribution in Britain do not own a car. They would be unaffected by road charges. Several methods of tackling road congestion are possible: electronic road pricing (ERP) schemes, cordon tolls or toll booths; restricted access at certain times or on certain days to different coloured/numbered cars - as in Athens and Mexico City; metered parking in residential areas near central business districts; closing roads to cars at certain busier times (Oxford); and toll bridges (the two Severn bridges). Schemes that involve directly banning drivers infringe personal freedom and are less desirable than road pricing. The best method would be ERP, where variable tariffs reflect the marginal external costs of a trip. In Spain, France, Italy, Japan and some US states, the toll revenue is used to finance new motorways. Other ERP systems have been installed in Barcelona, Lisbon, Dallas, Oklahoma and Florida. Oslo has had a system in place since 1990 using electronic tags and beacons around the central business district. Singapore is testing a newer system and Stockholm is beginning a similar scheme for its ring road. \u0095 Andrew Oswald is professor of economics at Warwick University",

      "trailText": "<p>Zimbabwe's first independent radio station has been shut down by armed paramilitaries on President Mugabe's orders.  <strong>Stephen Armstrong</strong>  reports.</p>",
      "byline": "Stephen Armstrong",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It was when she got the call saying that AK47-toting paramilitary police had occupied her house that Gerry Jackson knew she was in real trouble. It was harsher than she'd expected, but she knew there was going to be some sort of reaction. Running Capital Radio in Zimbabwe isn't like playing the Pepsi Chart Show on Capital Radio in London. When President Mugabe doesn't like you, he doesn't turn to the Radio Authority. He reaches for his gun. </p> <p>Capital Radio in Zimbabwe is the first bid for broadcasting freedom in a country that has only had the state-controlled radio of ZBC since independence. To maintain ZBC's four-channel monopoly, it has been an imprisonable offence to own a transmitter, making 1960s-style pirate radio broadcasting a terrifying risk. The mainly white directors of Capital Radio, led by Jackson, have had a shell company since 1996 but it's been a station without a signal until a legal challenge in the Supreme Court proved unexpectedly successful on September 22. </p> <p>The challenge was based on a pioneering attack on Mugabe's legislation by black businessman Strive Masiywa. Five years ago, Masiywa argued that Mugabe's attempts to prevent him setting up a mobile phone company breached the freedom of expression clause in the Zimbabwean constitution. Econet got the go-ahead and, in a curious footnote, it was text messages relayed on Econet phones that rallied opposition attempts to block Mugabe's referendum on constitutional reform. </p> <p>Back in old media, however, Masiywa's challenge was used by Capital to argue that it had a right to broadcast. The Supreme Court agreed, a transmitter was rushed up from South Africa and test transmissions of music on 90FM began two weeks ago. </p> <p>The station's idents were uncannily similar to Capital Radio's familiar smiling sun logo and the 24-hour music mix was on the softer side of soft rock. By Sunday October 1, the first news and current affairs programmes went out and this, it would appear, prompted the government to act. </p> <p>\"In Zimbabwe, radio is the only medium that reaches rural areas,\" Jackson explains. \"It was the rural vote that stopped Mugabe getting thrown out at the last election. We wanted to set up a soft-rock music station, but we also wanted to provide independent news. Once we started reaching the rural communities, it became clear to the government that they couldn't keep transmitting lies to the electorate so they had to do something.\" </p> <p>Station staff maintain the news was light and certainly not anti-government. They also insist that the talk programming had stopped by Tuesday and the output had returned to the all-music test transmission. In spite of this, at 4pm on Wednesday October 4, the police occupied Jackson's house and surrounded the houses of all those involved in Capital Radio. Wielding AK47s, they set up road blocks and searched everyone entering and leaving the premises. </p> <p>Moving quickly, Capital Radio's directors got their lawyers into the High Court and had the police activities declared illegal. The station was helped by the high-profile father of one of its directors, Mike Auret Jnr. Auret Snr is an MP with Zimbabwe's opposition party MBC and a prominent lawyer. Despite this, the police broke into the hotel that housed Capital's offices and transmitter and confiscated all its equipment. Repeated High Court rulings that this was illegal had no effect, and the following day the station's staff were stunned when Mugabe announced that, using his presidential powers, he had changed the law to effectively ban Capital. Still in hiding, they've mounted yet another legal challenge which they hope will be heard today - but they aren't hopeful. </p> <p>\"When the government announced the presidential decree, the home affairs minister John Nkomo said that 'all this running to the courts will soon be a thing of the past,' which makes us extremely alarmed,\" Jackson says. \"Our broadcasts were so inoffensive. We mainly played old 1960s stuff like Buffalo Springfield and Zimbabwean artists. Now there's a 24-hour checkpoint outside my house and warrants have been issued for our lawyer's arrest for obstructing the course of justice.\" </p> <p>And so the situation remains locked in stalemate, recalling the days of Radio Caroline versus the BBC Light Service in the 1960s. Even the music is the same. The only real difference is that the government side is employing paramilitary police with AK47s, who appear to ignore any court ruling that interferes with their activities.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was when she got the call saying that AK47-toting paramilitary police had occupied her house that Gerry Jackson knew she was in real trouble. It was harsher than she'd expected, but she knew there was going to be some sort of reaction. Running Capital Radio in Zimbabwe isn't like playing the Pepsi Chart Show on Capital Radio in London. When President Mugabe doesn't like you, he doesn't turn to the Radio Authority. He reaches for his gun. Capital Radio in Zimbabwe is the first bid for broadcasting freedom in a country that has only had the state-controlled radio of ZBC since independence. To maintain ZBC's four-channel monopoly, it has been an imprisonable offence to own a transmitter, making 1960s-style pirate radio broadcasting a terrifying risk. The mainly white directors of Capital Radio, led by Jackson, have had a shell company since 1996 but it's been a station without a signal until a legal challenge in the Supreme Court proved unexpectedly successful on September 22. The challenge was based on a pioneering attack on Mugabe's legislation by black businessman Strive Masiywa. Five years ago, Masiywa argued that Mugabe's attempts to prevent him setting up a mobile phone company breached the freedom of expression clause in the Zimbabwean constitution. Econet got the go-ahead and, in a curious footnote, it was text messages relayed on Econet phones that rallied opposition attempts to block Mugabe's referendum on constitutional reform. Back in old media, however, Masiywa's challenge was used by Capital to argue that it had a right to broadcast. The Supreme Court agreed, a transmitter was rushed up from South Africa and test transmissions of music on 90FM began two weeks ago. The station's idents were uncannily similar to Capital Radio's familiar smiling sun logo and the 24-hour music mix was on the softer side of soft rock. By Sunday October 1, the first news and current affairs programmes went out and this, it would appear, prompted the government to act. \"In Zimbabwe, radio is the only medium that reaches rural areas,\" Jackson explains. \"It was the rural vote that stopped Mugabe getting thrown out at the last election. We wanted to set up a soft-rock music station, but we also wanted to provide independent news. Once we started reaching the rural communities, it became clear to the government that they couldn't keep transmitting lies to the electorate so they had to do something.\" Station staff maintain the news was light and certainly not anti-government. They also insist that the talk programming had stopped by Tuesday and the output had returned to the all-music test transmission. In spite of this, at 4pm on Wednesday October 4, the police occupied Jackson's house and surrounded the houses of all those involved in Capital Radio. Wielding AK47s, they set up road blocks and searched everyone entering and leaving the premises. Moving quickly, Capital Radio's directors got their lawyers into the High Court and had the police activities declared illegal. The station was helped by the high-profile father of one of its directors, Mike Auret Jnr. Auret Snr is an MP with Zimbabwe's opposition party MBC and a prominent lawyer. Despite this, the police broke into the hotel that housed Capital's offices and transmitter and confiscated all its equipment. Repeated High Court rulings that this was illegal had no effect, and the following day the station's staff were stunned when Mugabe announced that, using his presidential powers, he had changed the law to effectively ban Capital. Still in hiding, they've mounted yet another legal challenge which they hope will be heard today - but they aren't hopeful. \"When the government announced the presidential decree, the home affairs minister John Nkomo said that 'all this running to the courts will soon be a thing of the past,' which makes us extremely alarmed,\" Jackson says. \"Our broadcasts were so inoffensive. We mainly played old 1960s stuff like Buffalo Springfield and Zimbabwean artists. Now there's a 24-hour checkpoint outside my house and warrants have been issued for our lawyer's arrest for obstructing the course of justice.\" And so the situation remains locked in stalemate, recalling the days of Radio Caroline versus the BBC Light Service in the 1960s. Even the music is the same. The only real difference is that the government side is employing paramilitary police with AK47s, who appear to ignore any court ruling that interferes with their activities.",

      "trailText": "<p>Net radio is about to bust out of its simulcast straitjacket, so tune in on your PC \nor fridge and escape from wall-to-wall Britney Spears. <strong>Sean Dodson</strong> reports</p>",
      "byline": "Sean Dodson",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Continental Europe and the US may have been enjoying a flourishing net radio industry for nearly two years, with big corporate sites such as Spinner, Launch.com and Imagine Radio attracting massive audiences, but here in the UK - where licences have been almost impossible to obtain - the scene has been barren.</p> <p>But things are changing and a plucky little pirate station called Interface Radio, which went on the net to escape the DTI, is leading the way by attracting hundreds of thousands of hits each month from its small studio in London's east end.</p> <p>The success of Interface shows that there is a potentially huge audience for net radio in the UK. By identifying an audience that is not well served by terrestrial radio - namely underground dance music mixed by DJs - Interface has shown that there is an appetite for niche music channels outside the narrow confines of UK commercial radio. Interface has no sponsors, nor does it take ads on its site. It makes money by charging the DJs who provide the music \u00a310 per hour to play (it can stream more than one DJ at a time) and webcasting events for big clubs such as Gatecrasher.</p> <p>The reason why Interface's success has not been replicated by terrestrial radio stations so far is that obtaining a licence to broadcast music on the internet in the UK has proved nearly impossible. Although existing terrestrial radio stations have always been able to \"simulcast\" (stream the same content that is available on air) their output on the web, they have not been allowed to change the programming to make it web specific. And that, say the stations, is the fault of the UK record companies.</p> <p>In order to be allowed to broadcast music on the radio in the UK, a company used to have to obtain three separate licences. It had to sign with the publishers through an organisation called the Performing Rights Society; obtain a licence from the Mechanical Copyright Protection Society to allow it to store music, and, finally, it had to find a way to pay the record companies - usually through a company called Public Performance Limited. Effectively this has made commercial transmission an unappealing proposition, and stations in the US and continental Europe which have no such difficulty have been able to capitalise because most of them are available over here.</p> <p>But all that is about to change because the record companies have relaxed their regulations - and this has allowed Virgin Radio to improve on its existing online operation, and it could be the first of many. So far the site has been operating on a simulcast basis, but now the plan is to package it with different ads. Scottish Media Group, owners of Virgin Radio, say that eventually this will lead to a series of genre channels. </p> <p>John Ousbey is head of Ginger Online, the new media arm of the Scottish Media Group. He says: \"People who are listening to streaming media are twice as likely to buy online. They're more likely to click on banner ads, they've been online longer and they have better connections. They are basically a very net-literate audience and that opens up channels for us. Basically we can give advertisers a route into these very valuable customers.\"</p> <p>But it is not just new media upstarts who have designs on converting your PC into a radio.

      "bodyText": "Continental Europe and the US may have been enjoying a flourishing net radio industry for nearly two years, with big corporate sites such as Spinner, Launch.com and Imagine Radio attracting massive audiences, but here in the UK - where licences have been almost impossible to obtain - the scene has been barren. But things are changing and a plucky little pirate station called Interface Radio, which went on the net to escape the DTI, is leading the way by attracting hundreds of thousands of hits each month from its small studio in London's east end. The success of Interface shows that there is a potentially huge audience for net radio in the UK. By identifying an audience that is not well served by terrestrial radio - namely underground dance music mixed by DJs - Interface has shown that there is an appetite for niche music channels outside the narrow confines of UK commercial radio. Interface has no sponsors, nor does it take ads on its site. It makes money by charging the DJs who provide the music \u00a310 per hour to play (it can stream more than one DJ at a time) and webcasting events for big clubs such as Gatecrasher. The reason why Interface's success has not been replicated by terrestrial radio stations so far is that obtaining a licence to broadcast music on the internet in the UK has proved nearly impossible. Although existing terrestrial radio stations have always been able to \"simulcast\" (stream the same content that is available on air) their output on the web, they have not been allowed to change the programming to make it web specific. And that, say the stations, is the fault of the UK record companies. In order to be allowed to broadcast music on the radio in the UK, a company used to have to obtain three separate licences. It had to sign with the publishers through an organisation called the Performing Rights Society; obtain a licence from the Mechanical Copyright Protection Society to allow it to store music, and, finally, it had to find a way to pay the record companies - usually through a company called Public Performance Limited. Effectively this has made commercial transmission an unappealing proposition, and stations in the US and continental Europe which have no such difficulty have been able to capitalise because most of them are available over here. But all that is about to change because the record companies have relaxed their regulations - and this has allowed Virgin Radio to improve on its existing online operation, and it could be the first of many. So far the site has been operating on a simulcast basis, but now the plan is to package it with different ads. Scottish Media Group, owners of Virgin Radio, say that eventually this will lead to a series of genre channels. John Ousbey is head of Ginger Online, the new media arm of the Scottish Media Group. He says: \"People who are listening to streaming media are twice as likely to buy online. They're more likely to click on banner ads, they've been online longer and they have better connections. They are basically a very net-literate audience and that opens up channels for us. Basically we can give advertisers a route into these very valuable customers.\" But it is not just new media upstarts who have designs on converting your PC into a radio. Bruno Brookes, onetime presenter of Radio 1's Top 40 show, recently set up StormLive.com - a net radio station hoping to tap into a market of 40-something listeners.

For a few hours, there were signs that sense would prevail after Israeli and Palestinian security forces agreed to a ceasefire in Gaza - the fifth such truce since the violence began.</p> <p>Less than three months after Mr Barak and Mr Arafat came closer than any leaders before to achieving a lasting peace, seven years of negotiating effort were unravelling at dizzying speed. The national security adviser, Major General Uzi Dayan, went even further than Mr Barak, saying the army would consider bombing Mr Arafat's headquarters.</p> <p>Palestinian leaders showed no signs of flinching. Instead, they pointed to an overnight resolution of the UN security council condemning Israel's excessive use of force, and a casualty list of 83 dead and 2,000 wounded, almost all Palestinian. Hanan Ashrawi, a spokeswoman, said: \"Arafat cannot give orders to a people, to a whole nation that is being killed every day, that is being asked to lie back and die quietly and not defend themselves.\"</p> <p>Israel's commander in Gaza, Major General Yom Tov Samia, said the Palestinians had agreed to stop all violence, open roads, halt the release of jailed Hamas suicide bombers and clamp down on Palestinian television, which has been broadcasting footage of funerals and bloody clashes. But should the agreement collapse, he said: \"I will be free as a military commander to undertake any action.\"</p> <p>Yesterday, that freedom included razing two blocks of flats and a warehouse near the Netzarim junction, a constant flashpoint.

      "bodyText": "Israel today is poised perilously between peace and a resumption of war with the Palestinians, with only hours to go before the deadline at which its prime minister, Ehud Barak, has threatened to declare the peace process dead and buried. As stone-throwing youths descended yesterday on an Israeli army outpost in Gaza that has been a constant flashpoint of the past 11 days of violence, Mr Barak renewed his ultimatum to the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat: stop the violence by tonight or risk the full might of Israel's wrath. \"If we will not see the difference implemented actively on the ground, and a calming of the situation, we will draw the conclusion that Arafat has deliberately decided to abandon the peace process and prefers deadlock and confrontation,\" he said. Mr Barak's threat came on a day when Presidents Bill Clinton and Vladimir Putin made determined efforts to pull both sides back from the brink. For a few hours, there were signs that sense would prevail after Israeli and Palestinian security forces agreed to a ceasefire in Gaza - the fifth such truce since the violence began. Less than three months after Mr Barak and Mr Arafat came closer than any leaders before to achieving a lasting peace, seven years of negotiating effort were unravelling at dizzying speed. The national security adviser, Major General Uzi Dayan, went even further than Mr Barak, saying the army would consider bombing Mr Arafat's headquarters. Palestinian leaders showed no signs of flinching. Instead, they pointed to an overnight resolution of the UN security council condemning Israel's excessive use of force, and a casualty list of 83 dead and 2,000 wounded, almost all Palestinian. Hanan Ashrawi, a spokeswoman, said: \"Arafat cannot give orders to a people, to a whole nation that is being killed every day, that is being asked to lie back and die quietly and not defend themselves.\" Israel's commander in Gaza, Major General Yom Tov Samia, said the Palestinians had agreed to stop all violence, open roads, halt the release of jailed Hamas suicide bombers and clamp down on Palestinian television, which has been broadcasting footage of funerals and bloody clashes. But should the agreement collapse, he said: \"I will be free as a military commander to undertake any action.\" Yesterday, that freedom included razing two blocks of flats and a warehouse near the Netzarim junction, a constant flashpoint. In the West Bank, attack helicopters blasted hilltop positions near Hebron that had been used by Palestinian gunmen. Outside Ramallah, army commanders told Palestinians living near the isolated Jewish settlement of Psagot to leave their homes. In Nazareth, northern Israel, an Israeli Arab was killed yesterday in clashes with Jewish settlers who attacked houses there, the mayor said. But despite efforts behind the scenes to contain passions that flared first with the provocative visit of a rightwing Israeli leader to the holiest Muslim site in Jerusalem, the Haram al-Sharif, events may be spiralling beyond the control of Mr Arafat and Mr Barak. Although yesterday was spared the bloody gunbattles of earlier days, the killing is atomising, with Israeli civilians stoning Palestinians in isolated attacks, and individual Palestinian cities charting an independent court of violent action. On the eve of the Jewish day of atonement, and 27 years to the day after their last war for survival, many Israelis were overwhelmed by a sense of siege, contemplating the resumption of all-out conflict with the Palestinians, and possibly Lebanon, following Saturday's kidnapping of three soldiers on the border. They also faced humiliation, with television pictures showing Palestinians taking pickaxes and setting fire to Joseph's Tomb, a Jewish pilgrimage site in Nablus. The mob descended within minutes of a decision by the Israeli army to transfer control of the site to Palestinian forces, and its destruction is seen as a symbol of betrayal, and the inability of Mr Arafat to impose order. \"Within a few hours we have seen exactly how responsible the Palestinian Authority was in maintaining this holy site,\" said Yitzhak Herzog, the cabinet secretary. Once the master of all in the Palestinian-ruled areas, Mr Arafat's grip is weakening, Israeli intelligence officials said yesterday. They argued that a younger generation of street-smart fighters, the tanzim, was challenging his authority. An intelligence official said: \"Arafat may not be able to stop the rioters now. Even if he wants to do it, he has a great problem with the people - not with the officials of the Palestinian Authority, but with the mob. He is afraid of using power against the people because the people of the tanzim have great momentum.\" There were further signs that Mr Arafat's authority was splintering, as leaders of his Fatah organisation in the West Bank city of Ramallah handed out leaflets modelled on the intifada of the late 1980s.

After seven years of publishing his sometimes sensational, occasionally world-beating news reports and gimmicky gossip on the internet, Drudge the cyberscourge has taken to the long form and published a book, The Drudge Manifesto. Or, as he puts it, \"infamous internet news maverick who blew the lid off the Monica Lewinsky scandal gives a middle finger to the establishment\". A mixture of memoir, jabs at the media and a bit of name-dropping - he claims Dustin Hoffman asked him: \"Who's gonna play you in the movie?\" - the book reflects his unflagging enthusiasm for news in all its forms as well as a somewhat naive wonder that he has attained such fame. \"This wasn't supposed to happen,\" he says, taking time between the non-stop ringing of his telephone to talk about himself and his book. \"I was never supposed to be this successful. I just got lucky. I had a window of opportunity and I flung my entire body through it. All my dreams have been fulfilled and now I'm waiting for the nightmares.\" As we talk, Drudge is monitoring and updating the stories of the day. \"It's fantastic - Albright chased after Arafat to bring him back and she was talking on a cell phone.

The unfuzzy actuarial tables suggest that the next president will have to appoint at least one new justice and if GW wins that means a generation of social reform is at risk. Scalia and Thomas are ideological antifederalists determined to push back the authority of the national government.</p> <p>It is easy to forget that the US is a federal state. The central government can take action at a national level only on certain criteria defined by the constitution. All other powers are reserved to the states, and people and businesses in the states are constantly appealing to the supreme court to declare unconstitutional some penalty or protection based on a federal, not state, law.</p> <p>One new justice who thinks like Scalia or Thomas will tilt the balance of the court. The risk that abortion rights secured by Roe v Wade will be nullified gets all the attention, but what is at stake is a veto of a wide range of federal laws and previous supreme court rulings affecting a panoply of rights and protections - and future laws passed by the elected congress.</p> <p>Thomas and Scalia have constructed anti-federalist majorities, based on narrow interpretations of the constitution, with the help of Chief Justice William H Rehnquist, and Justices Anthony Kennedy and Sandra O'Connor. These three are not guaranteed to be antifederalist but they have often given Scalia/ Thomas 5-4 majorities against Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, David Souter and John Paul Stevens.</p> <p>Christy Brzonkala knows the importance of that one-vote majority. A student at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, she claimed to have been raped by two of its football team. Virginia Tech did nothing, so she filed suit in a federal district court against the Tech and the footballers for violation of her civil rights, relying on a federal law, the Violence Against Women Act. It was a bipartisan act, based on four years of factfinding which convinced Congress that gender-motivated violence warranted federal intervention.</p> <p>Several courts had made awards under the act, but the nine members of the supreme court ruled by five votes to four that the federal government had no power to protect Christy. It was a backward step for women and for civil rights generally. What was extraordinary was that a majority of states were firmly on the side of the federal law. Attorneys-general from 38 states testified to the human suffering and billion-dollar public costs of state enforcement policies and practices that treat violence against women less seriously than comparable violence against men.</p> <p>Repudiating 60 years' precedent, the court ruled that the federal government is constitutionally forbidden to criminalise possessing a gun in a school zone, cannot regulate tobacco marketing, cannot require states to regulate the disposal of low-level radioactive waste, cannot insist on the states respecting federal laws involving overtime wages, patent infringement and false advertising. A new term promises similar fates for a range of initiatives - and there will be constitutional challenges to the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act.</p> <p>The Thomas/Scalia thesis, which appeals to GW Bush and the Republican right, is that they are not being reactionary, merely faithful to the founding fathers. That is a historical fallacy. Cass Sunstein, the University of Chicago constitutional scholar, is to argue in the American Prospect magazine that the \"liberal\" four are conservatively in line with the framers of the constitution, and the fiery five are revolutionaries. The constitution was not born from fear of national authority, as Republicans maintain. On the contrary, it was created by the federalists out of fear that state power would stand in the way of a national economic marketplace, even of the birth of a nation.</p> <p>States will not take a lead in regulation or worker protection when they are in competition for business with other states. Many are notoriously pliable, doing the bidding of special interests. Governor GW's home state of Texas is the most polluted in the nation, but he is satisfied with a self-policing deal he did with the oil industry. You have only to breathe the air in Midland, Texas, to become a fervent federalist. The supreme court should hold a few sessions down there.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Virginia Tech did nothing, so she filed suit in a federal district court against the Tech and the footballers for violation of her civil rights, relying on a federal law, the Violence Against Women Act. It was a bipartisan act, based on four years of factfinding which convinced Congress that gender-motivated violence warranted federal intervention. Several courts had made awards under the act, but the nine members of the supreme court ruled by five votes to four that the federal government had no power to protect Christy. It was a backward step for women and for civil rights generally. What was extraordinary was that a majority of states were firmly on the side of the federal law. Attorneys-general from 38 states testified to the human suffering and billion-dollar public costs of state enforcement policies and practices that treat violence against women less seriously than comparable violence against men. Repudiating 60 years' precedent, the court ruled that the federal government is constitutionally forbidden to criminalise possessing a gun in a school zone, cannot regulate tobacco marketing, cannot require states to regulate the disposal of low-level radioactive waste, cannot insist on the states respecting federal laws involving overtime wages, patent infringement and false advertising. A new term promises similar fates for a range of initiatives - and there will be constitutional challenges to the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act. The Thomas/Scalia thesis, which appeals to GW Bush and the Republican right, is that they are not being reactionary, merely faithful to the founding fathers. That is a historical fallacy. Cass Sunstein, the University of Chicago constitutional scholar, is to argue in the American Prospect magazine that the \"liberal\" four are conservatively in line with the framers of the constitution, and the fiery five are revolutionaries. The constitution was not born from fear of national authority, as Republicans maintain. On the contrary, it was created by the federalists out of fear that state power would stand in the way of a national economic marketplace, even of the birth of a nation. States will not take a lead in regulation or worker protection when they are in competition for business with other states. Many are notoriously pliable, doing the bidding of special interests. Governor GW's home state of Texas is the most polluted in the nation, but he is satisfied with a self-policing deal he did with the oil industry. You have only to breathe the air in Midland, Texas, to become a fervent federalist. The supreme court should hold a few sessions down there. comment@theguardian.com",

In Smederevo, people are more relaxed. \"The police live among us. This is a town where everyone knows each other,\" Mr Kele said. Elections are due for the Serbian parliament and presidency next year. \"People are already preparing for the opposition to win them too.\"",

      "bodyText": "Hillary Clinton consolidated her position yesterday as favourite to win the Senate rate in New York race, refusing to be fazed in a TV debate even by a question about why she stayed with her husband after his affair with the young staff member Monica Lewinsky. Rather than respond with a pained expression as she has done in the past, Mrs Clinton attempted to turn the matter to her advantage. \"I've made my choices,\" she said during the third main televised political debate of the week in the US. \"I'm here with my daughter, of whom I'm very proud. We have a family and that means a very lot to us.\" Mrs Clinton, the only woman in the series of presidential, vice-presidential and senate debates going on as the election campaign enters its final phase before November's vote, suggested that the experience could help her to become a more effective senator. \"The choices I've made in my life are right for me. I can't talk about anybody else's choices,\" she said. \"I can only say mine have been based on my religious faith, on my strong sense of family and what I believe is right and important. Many of my experiences will give me insights into what I can do to be a good senator.\" Rick Lazio, her Republican opponent, who was accused of appearing too aggressive in their previous debate, made no attempt to cash in on the issue: \"I think that this was Mrs Clinton's choice and I respect whatever choice she makes.\" Even if the second debate were rated as a draw, that would represent a victory for Mrs Clinton, who has scored consistently at or above 50% in recent opinion surveys. Nothing happened in yesterday's debate that is likely to affect the outcome; the race is now perceived as hers to lose. Neither Mrs Clinton nor Mr Lazio departed from the substance of any of their oft-repeated positions and there were no gaffes or innovations on either side. This was in contrast with last month's first debate in which Mr Lazio left his podium to wave in his opponent's face a sheaf of papers which he demanded that she sign, banning the use of unregulated money for political advertisements in the contest. That tactic rebounded on Mr Lazio when it turned out that the issue had gone over the heads of the electorate, which was left rather with an impression of the Republican as a bully. Subsequently, the candidates struck a deal that was impossible to enforce on not using so-called soft money from business, unions and interest groups. At first, the agreement appeared to be a victory for Mr Lazio - albeit on an issue that does not move voters - but then his campaign was accused of breaching the agreement. \"Last month Mr Lazio said this was an issue of trust and character,\" Mrs Clinton said at the debate yesterday. \"He was right. And if New Yorkers can't trust him to keep his word for 10 days, how can they trust him for six years?\" Mr Lazio responded: \"Mrs Clinton, please, no lectures from Motel 1600,\" a reference to the address of the White House at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, where many of her supporters have enjoyed overnight accommodation. Mr Lazio, who for some time presented himself as fundamentally the \"not-Hillary-Clinton\" candidate, has tried to place trust and lack of it at the heart of his campaign, sending out leaflets saying that he could encapsulate his appeal in six words: \"I'm running against Hillary Rodham Clinton.\" Yesterday the candidates disagreed about most issues in a largely amiable fashion, she often with raised eyebrows, he with his head tilted to the right and on the balls of his feet. They were divided on the economy of New York state, the make-up of the supreme court, on school vouchers, on the war on drugs and even on a new sports stadium in Manhattan.",

It was, according to the gushing hyperbole of those who had championed the cause of entry a great day, as momentous an occasion as when the abolition of the corn laws marked the triumph of free trade over protectionism. </p> <p>Britain's two-year sojourn inside the ERM was certainly momentous, although not in the way its supporters envisaged. The experience has left deep political scars, aggravating an innate suspicion of the way European institutions operate. Tony Blair knows this, which is why he sought last week to assuage fears that power was remorselessly sucked out of the hands of the public by calling for a second chamber to the European parliament made up of prominent national MPs. </p> <p>Mr Blair has the right idea, but he chose the wrong target. The real problem with the EU is not its toothless parliament but its over-mighty central bank.

      "bodyText": "Ten years ago today, Britain joined the exchange rate mechanism. It was, according to the gushing hyperbole of those who had championed the cause of entry a great day, as momentous an occasion as when the abolition of the corn laws marked the triumph of free trade over protectionism. Britain's two-year sojourn inside the ERM was certainly momentous, although not in the way its supporters envisaged. The experience has left deep political scars, aggravating an innate suspicion of the way European institutions operate. Tony Blair knows this, which is why he sought last week to assuage fears that power was remorselessly sucked out of the hands of the public by calling for a second chamber to the European parliament made up of prominent national MPs. Mr Blair has the right idea, but he chose the wrong target. The real problem with the EU is not its toothless parliament but its over-mighty central bank. Without root and branch reform of the way the European central bank operates, it is hard to envisage the UK voting for the euro, even were the government foolish enough to propose that the ECB - as currently constituted - be allowed to set interest rates here. One of the anomalies about the debate here is that those most exercised by the UK's so-called \"feudal\" constitution fail to raise a complaint about the ECB which - with its mixture of elitism, arrogance and incompetence - is as remote as the court of Louis XVI was from the people of pre-revolutionary France. Let's start with some fundamentals. By their nature, all independent central banks are undemocratic, since the whole point is that politicians should not be allowed to play fast and loose with interest rates, even if that is what voters want.

Allowing chancellors to cut taxes and raise spending ahead of elections could be seen as a reason for an independent fiscal policy committee, while an independent military policy committee made up of assorted brass hats would stop governments starting small wars in, let's say, the south Atlantic when polling day was looming.

The MPC's monthly meeting is seen as part of the rhythm of economic life, and enough checks and balances have been installed by the government to ensure that the Bank can not be hijacked by a group of inflation nutters.

The protests sweeping the Arab world are by far the most persistent and widespread for many years, even reminiscent, some say, of the 50s and 60s when President Nasser, the pan-Arab champion, would rouse the masses from the Gulf to the Atlantic.</p> <p>In Egypt, university students have been staging daily protest marches and sit-ins for more than a week. Yesterday Egyptian schoolchildren almost closed down the road to the airport. Some demonstrations, such as those in Baghdad, were state-sponsored. But most, like that in Syria, were spontaneous: last Wednesday 4,000 people stoned the heavily fortified US embassy, scaled its walls and tore down its flag, chanting \"Jerusalem is ours, down with America, down with Israel.\" There have been similar outbursts in Tunis, Sudan, Libya and Yemen, whose president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, proposed that Arab countries should provide the Palestinians with arms.</p> <p>Hundreds of thousands of Moroccans burning Israeli and US flags and chanting \"al-Quds [Jerusalem] is Arab and Muslim\" demonstrated in Rabat yesterday. Demonstrators, led by leftwing parties and unions, shouted: \"No concession, no compromise over al-Quds ... Palestine is in our heart, in our blood and mind ... We will never forget it, and never give up the struggle for it.\"</p> <p>Most strikingly, the protest has also spread to the Gulf, where there is little tradition of street protest. Last week a huge throng of students at Sultan Qabous University shouted \"with our souls and blood we shall redeem you, al-Aqsa\" [mosque in the Temple Mount complex]. They demanded the closure of the Israeli trade mission in their country. In the United Arab Emirates, schoolgirls in embroidered Palestinian dresses walked side by side with young men in local headgear and flowing white dishdashas. The protests reached even into Saudi Arabia, heartland of arch-conservative authoritarianism: on Wednesday, thousands burned Israeli and American flags in the streets of Sakakah in the kingdom's remote north.

There was a time when Palestine, as the Arab cause par excellence, had the power to topple regimes and foment revolution. Some now openly hope it could do so again. In the London-based al-Quds al-Arabi newspaper, a leading platform of Arab opposition movements, Abd al-Bari al-Atwan wrote: \"We pray to God to prolong the intifada, turn it into the trigger that will stir the Arab street to give vent to its accumulated frustrations.\"</p> <p>Yet, though this has been the most impressive outpouring of solidarity for years, the same thing has been seen, in one form or another, time and time again. And, time and again, emotion has never translated into serious action. Palestine may be a great rallying cry, but, to many Arabs, it is also a badge of shame.</p> <p>The anathemas heaped on Israel/America may be genuinely felt, but, beneath them, lies another, more significant emotion: self-disgust, a profound exasperation with Arab impotence in the face of a historic foe, and above all with regimes which are the chief expression of it.</p> <p>The fate of Mohammed al-Direh, the 12-year-old boy whose death was screened on television worldwide, had a special resonance. Like other obituarists, Sawsang al-Shaer wrote in the Kuwaiti newspaper al-Watan last week that not just Israeli soldiers, but the Arabs themselves, had the child's blood on their hands. \"Do you remember,\" she asked, \"TV footage of Israeli soldiers breaking the bones of Palestinian youth during the intifada a few years back? Didn't we fume and revolt and threaten? What happened afterwards? Nothing. Didn't the sight of Mohammed appal every one of us? What will happen now? Nothing.\"</p> <p>The growing anger of the Arab \"street\", the passionate rhetoric of the intelligentsia, does seem to have begun to alarm Arab leaders, and in response they are planning a summit on the crisis, in Cairo on October 21. In an indication of the enormous cross-section of Arab opinion that will be represented there, the Libyan leader, Muammar Gadafy, and the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, yesterday announced they were to hold talks this week with Saudi Arabia in preparation for the summit.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia has agreed to attend, defying the US pressures which are a key reason for its traditional reluctance to do so. Iraq is to go too, in another breakthrough in Saddam Hussein's quest for rehabilitation. He is in exultant, belligerent mood. In language not far removed from his \"I will burn half of Israel\" speech on the eve of the invasion of Kuwait, he said last week: \"You see how many Arab kings and presidents we have, yet 5m worthless people [the Israelis] oppress our people in Palestine and slaughter our children. Let them give Iraq a small adjacent piece of land and they'll see how quickly we finish off Zionism.\"</p> <p>The Cairo summit is the creation of President Mubarak, who has come under rare, direct criticism in Egypt's \"opposition\" newspapers for his approach to the crisis. \"The Egyptian people are angry, Mr President,\" said the editor of al-Wafd. \"We demand the breaking of relations with Israel. It is the minimum the people will accept.\" Even the \"official\", state-controlled press is sounding militant. Ahmad Ragab, perhaps Egypt's most popular columnist, said in al-Akhbar that the Arabs should use \"the oil weapon\" to free Jerusalem, especially with an energy crisis looming in the west.</p> <p>Instead, he added sarcastically, they have \"placed their oil under the protection of William Cohen, the US secretary for the defence of Israel.\"</p>",

Didn't we fume and revolt and threaten? What happened afterwards? Nothing. Didn't the sight of Mohammed appal every one of us? What will happen now? Nothing.\" The growing anger of the Arab \"street\", the passionate rhetoric of the intelligentsia, does seem to have begun to alarm Arab leaders, and in response they are planning a summit on the crisis, in Cairo on October 21. In an indication of the enormous cross-section of Arab opinion that will be represented there, the Libyan leader, Muammar Gadafy, and the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, yesterday announced they were to hold talks this week with Saudi Arabia in preparation for the summit. Saudi Arabia has agreed to attend, defying the US pressures which are a key reason for its traditional reluctance to do so. Iraq is to go too, in another breakthrough in Saddam Hussein's quest for rehabilitation. He is in exultant, belligerent mood. In language not far removed from his \"I will burn half of Israel\" speech on the eve of the invasion of Kuwait, he said last week: \"You see how many Arab kings and presidents we have, yet 5m worthless people [the Israelis] oppress our people in Palestine and slaughter our children. Let them give Iraq a small adjacent piece of land and they'll see how quickly we finish off Zionism.\" The Cairo summit is the creation of President Mubarak, who has come under rare, direct criticism in Egypt's \"opposition\" newspapers for his approach to the crisis. \"The Egyptian people are angry, Mr President,\" said the editor of al-Wafd. \"We demand the breaking of relations with Israel. It is the minimum the people will accept.\" Even the \"official\", state-controlled press is sounding militant. Ahmad Ragab, perhaps Egypt's most popular columnist, said in al-Akhbar that the Arabs should use \"the oil weapon\" to free Jerusalem, especially with an energy crisis looming in the west. Instead, he added sarcastically, they have \"placed their oil under the protection of William Cohen, the US secretary for the defence of Israel.\"",

      "bodyText": "Israel yesterday choked back its fury at the kidnapping of three soldiers, holding off on threats to bomb Hizbullah guerrillas and Syrian installations in Lebanon to explore prospects of a prisoner swap to win their release. But as Israeli warplanes flew over Beirut and hundreds of tanks rumbled northwards, there was a pervasive sense of dread that four months of relative quiet along the Lebanese border could give way to open confrontation - and that Syria could be dragged into the war. The kidnapping of the three soldiers by Hizbullah guerrillas, followed by shelling along the border, is the most serious rupture in an uneasy calm that has prevailed since May, when Israel ended its 22-year occupation of south Lebanon. Apart from tense stand-offs between Israeli soldiers and stone-throwing Lebanese at border crossings, the peace held until Saturday afternoon, when the soldiers - two Israeli Jews and a Bedouin - were snatched during a patrol of the Sheba'a border region, which Hizbullah claims as Lebanese territory. There has been no news on them since. On Saturday, the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, warned Lebanon and Syria, the real power in that country, that he would take \"forceful action\" to secure the release of the soldiers. Yesterday, he reinforced that message by charging Syria with \"supreme responsibility to ensure there will be no hostile actions against Israel from Lebanon\". In return, Hizbullah's leader, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, said that his men would retaliate in force if Israel attacked Lebanon. \"We will make the enemy understand that Lebanon is not too weak to take revenge.\" From Damascus, the al-Ba'ath newspaper, the mouthpiece of the ruling party, weighed in by dismissing Mr Barak's threats as \"frivolous\". \"Such language has not intimidated either Syria or Lebanon,\" the paper said. Behind the rhetoric there are international efforts to get the three soldiers back safely, probably by trading Lebanese who have been held hostage in Israeli jails for years. The Israeli cabinet secretary, Yitzhak Herzog, said that \"major international efforts\" were going on to find the three soldiers, involving Mr Barak, the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, and the Red Cross. Reports from Beirut said that Hizbullah was seeking German mediation to organise an exchange of the three soldiers for men held in Israeli jails. Hizbullah reportedly wants the release of 19 Lebanese, as well as scores of Palestinian detainees, members of the Islamic Jihad and Hamas. However, the prospects for an exchange are deeply clouded. Yesterday, a spokesman for Mr Barak told army radio that he expected a \"sign of life\" from the kidnapped men before Israel embarked on negotiations for their release. Hizbullah said it wanted Israel to free its captives first. Fourteen years ago an airforce navigator, Ron Arad, was shot down over Lebanon, and his disappearance continues to haunt Israel. It retaliated by kidnapping Lebanese militia leaders and detaining them for years, referring to them as \"bargaining chips\" in the campaign to win information about Mr Arad's fate. Although the Israeli government released about 13 Lebanese last spring, it has stubbornly hung on to its two prize catches: a Lebanese guerrilla leader seized in 1994 and a cleric kidnapped in 1989.Sheikh Abdel Karim Obeid, and Mustafa Dirani, the security chief of the Amal Shia militia, have been seen only once since their capture, when they appeared in open court earlier this year.

Denise Plumber, a dairy and arable farmer from Wiltshire, points out that farmers can literally go for days without seeing another two-legged soul.

      "body": "<p>When Bessie, a regular American cow, goes into labour next month, humankind will be on the threshold of a new era in its efforts to repair the damage it has done to the world's wildlife. </p> <p>US scientists announced yesterday that, if all goes well, Bessie will give birth to something extraordinary - a cloned Indian bison, or gaur, a giant ox-like animal whose existence in the wild of southern Asia is threatened. </p> <p>By using the technique which created Dolly the sheep to generate endangered animals in the eggs and wombs of common creatures such as cows, researchers have opened the door to a future where even extinct species such as mammoths could walk the earth again. </p> <p>The scientists, from a commercial firm, Massachusetts-based Advanced Cell Technology (ACT), have already announced plans to recreate one extinct species - a Pyrenean mountain goat called the bucardo, the last one of which was killed by a falling tree in January. </p> <p>Even before the gaur calf is born, the scientists who created it have given it a portentous name, Noah, after the Biblical character who saved the world's animals from destruction. In their vision, the arks of the future will consist of frozen tissue banks, and disembarkation will be by cloning - with black bears giving birth to pandas, one kind of tiger giving birth to another and, in the remote future, elephants giving birth to mammoths. </p> <p>\"The technology is no longer science fiction. It's very real, and we expect the first endangered species in a few weeks,\" Robert Lanza, of ACT, said yesterday. </p> <p><strong> Huge drawbacks</strong><br> </p> <p> But the plans were criticised by other scientists who said cloning and tissue banks had huge drawbacks compared to other ways of conserving threatened species. </p> <p>Pointing out that the gaur was not, as ACT claimed, \"on the brink of extinction\", Bill Holt, of the Zoological Society in London, said: \"Unless there's a really special reason - and there may be, in a small number of cases - we should go for much simpler techniques of conservation.\" </p> <p>Whatever the application of the technique, ACT has crossed a new line in cloning. To create Noah, Lanza's team took 692 skin cells from a bull gaur which died naturally. Using the \"Dolly\" technique, they removed the DNA from an equivalent number of ordinary cow eggs, and injected the adult guar cells, with their DNA, into the hollowed-out eggs. </p> <p>A tiny jolt of electricity fused DNA and egg together and the guar-cow cells began to grow into embryos. Only 81 grew enough to be implanted into cow wombs, only eight cows became pregnant, and five miscarried - reflecting the typically high failure rate of cloning. </p> <p>Two other embryos were removed early to see how they were faring; Noah appears to be a normal gaur calf, on track to make his appearance next month. </p> <p>\"Most scientists thought this was impossible,\" said Dr Lanza. \"For the first time, a species has been conceived using the eggs and surrogate mother of an entirely different species. </p> <p>\"Up till now there have only been a few reports of this technique of embryo formation in petri dishes. We've taken it out of the lab and into the barnyard, and not only were we able to get embryos, but we've been able to get beautiful little gaurs.\" </p> <p>Noah is not strictly 100% gaur, because even though the nucleus of the cow egg is removed, the rest of the egg contains a tiny amount of its own DNA. But Dr Lanza said he believed it would be possible to get round this. </p> <p>The next goal for ACT is to clone its first extinct animal, the bucardo. After Spanish gamekeepers came across the corpse of the last bucardo, Spanish scientists took tissue samples and froze them, meaning there are likely to be cells with intact DNA which ACT can use to transfer into goat eggs. Goats have already been cloned, so given the closeness of domestic and mountain goats, there would appear to be no major obstacle to regenerating the extinct species. </p> <p><strong> Saving the panda</strong><br> </p> <p> Dr Lanza's team is also looking at ways of saving the panda. Its closest relatives are racoons and rabbits, but panda cubs would be a hefty burden for a small animal to become pregnant with, so ACT hopes to use black bears as egg donors and surrogate panda mothers. The firm is harvesting eggs from female black bears shot dead by hunters. The black bear is not an endangered species. </p> <p>The company has no plans to try to revive long extinct animals such the Tasmanian tiger or the dodo, let alone the dinosaur - although there are major projects under way to try to recover and repair DNA from mammoths and Tasmanian tigers for cloning. </p> <p>\"I have a brontosaurus bone at home weighing 800lbs,\" said Dr Lanza. \"The first thing everybody asks me is: 'Are you going to clone that?' I tell them you need a living cell. Even if you could get one, a brontosaurus weighs 30 to 50 tons - where would you get a female animal to carry one?\" </p> <p>Dr Holt opposes cloning to bring back the bucardo from a single animal. This would result in a population of genetically identical animals, he warned, with all the dire consequences of inbreeding. If disease or environmental change hit a wild population of clones, hesaid, and one animal died, the chances are they would all die. </p> <p>He questioned whether the complexity and cost of cloning pandas was worthwhile when they could be artificially inseminated, and argued that it was banks of endangered animals' eggs and sperm, rather than tissue, which needed to be created to preserve genetic diversity. </p> <p>On the likes of mammoths, he said: \"We've got enough endangered species which we need to support without bring ing back more which are probably doomed anyway.\" </p> <p>Professor David Macdonald, director of the wildlife conservation unit at Oxford University, was more equivocal. \"These molecular techniques do hold enormous potential for contributing good in ingenious ways to conservation,\" he said. </p> <p><strong> Rescuing lost genes</strong><br> </p> <p> \"There are hierarchies of priorities and, in mine, saving the habitats of existing, viable species is a higher priority. Reconstituting something that's extinct, while having a certain fascination, is less urgent than saving more things from becoming extinct. But I'm not saying this is a waste of time, trivial or wrong.\" </p> <p>Dr Lanza denied he and his colleagues wanted to make cloning the focus of conservation. \"The aim here is not to use cloning to generate large numbers of animals,\" he said. \"Habitat conservation is the cornerstone of all preservation efforts. But this is a tool to rescue genes that would be otherwise lost.\" </p> <p><strong> Species: Panda <br> Status: Endangered.</strong><br> Fewer than a thousand remain in their shrinking natural habitat in south-west China, with 100 in zoos. They have sex rarely, dislike breeding in captivity and are picky eaters. </p> <p><strong> Cloning potential: High. </strong> Chinese scientists have produced cloned panda embryos by inserting a panda cell nucleus into a rabbit egg. US scientists hope to use black bear eggs and surrogate mothers. </p> <p><strong> Species: Tasmanian tiger <br> Status: Extinct.</strong> <br>The last known representative of this striped, wolf-like marsupial species died in a zoo in Hobart in 1936. </p> <p><strong> Cloning potential: Poor</strong> , were it not for the huge effort to bring it back. The New South Wales government has given the Australian Museum in Sydney $1m to do it. But the DNA available for cloning is 134 years old and in bad condition. </p> <p><strong> Species: Barbary lion <br> Status: Unknown. </strong></p> <p>Thought to be the species which devoured Christians in the Roman circus, the last Barbary lion in its natural habitat, north Africa, was killed in Morocco in 1922, but it is thought some may live on in Middle Eastern zoos. </p> <p><strong> Cloning potential: Fair</strong> , but only if a survivor can be found, or genes can be recovered from hybrids. </p> <p><strong> Species: Mammoth <br> Status: Extinct 4,000 years.</strong><br> The existence of this furry elephant is known only from bones, tusks, frozen remains in Siberia and cave drawings. </p> <p><strong> Cloning potential: Poor.</strong> Scientists hope to get a crack at injecting an elephant egg with DNA from a frozen mammoth cell, but the DNA is likely to be damaged by its time in the permafrost. </p>",

In their vision, the arks of the future will consist of frozen tissue banks, and disembarkation will be by cloning - with black bears giving birth to pandas, one kind of tiger giving birth to another and, in the remote future, elephants giving birth to mammoths. \"The technology is no longer science fiction. It's very real, and we expect the first endangered species in a few weeks,\" Robert Lanza, of ACT, said yesterday. Huge drawbacks But the plans were criticised by other scientists who said cloning and tissue banks had huge drawbacks compared to other ways of conserving threatened species. Pointing out that the gaur was not, as ACT claimed, \"on the brink of extinction\", Bill Holt, of the Zoological Society in London, said: \"Unless there's a really special reason - and there may be, in a small number of cases - we should go for much simpler techniques of conservation.\" Whatever the application of the technique, ACT has crossed a new line in cloning. To create Noah, Lanza's team took 692 skin cells from a bull gaur which died naturally. Using the \"Dolly\" technique, they removed the DNA from an equivalent number of ordinary cow eggs, and injected the adult guar cells, with their DNA, into the hollowed-out eggs. A tiny jolt of electricity fused DNA and egg together and the guar-cow cells began to grow into embryos. Only 81 grew enough to be implanted into cow wombs, only eight cows became pregnant, and five miscarried - reflecting the typically high failure rate of cloning. Two other embryos were removed early to see how they were faring; Noah appears to be a normal gaur calf, on track to make his appearance next month. \"Most scientists thought this was impossible,\" said Dr Lanza. \"For the first time, a species has been conceived using the eggs and surrogate mother of an entirely different species. \"Up till now there have only been a few reports of this technique of embryo formation in petri dishes. We've taken it out of the lab and into the barnyard, and not only were we able to get embryos, but we've been able to get beautiful little gaurs.\" Noah is not strictly 100% gaur, because even though the nucleus of the cow egg is removed, the rest of the egg contains a tiny amount of its own DNA. But Dr Lanza said he believed it would be possible to get round this. The next goal for ACT is to clone its first extinct animal, the bucardo. After Spanish gamekeepers came across the corpse of the last bucardo, Spanish scientists took tissue samples and froze them, meaning there are likely to be cells with intact DNA which ACT can use to transfer into goat eggs. Goats have already been cloned, so given the closeness of domestic and mountain goats, there would appear to be no major obstacle to regenerating the extinct species. Saving the panda Dr Lanza's team is also looking at ways of saving the panda. Its closest relatives are racoons and rabbits, but panda cubs would be a hefty burden for a small animal to become pregnant with, so ACT hopes to use black bears as egg donors and surrogate panda mothers. The firm is harvesting eggs from female black bears shot dead by hunters. The black bear is not an endangered species. The company has no plans to try to revive long extinct animals such the Tasmanian tiger or the dodo, let alone the dinosaur - although there are major projects under way to try to recover and repair DNA from mammoths and Tasmanian tigers for cloning. \"I have a brontosaurus bone at home weighing 800lbs,\" said Dr Lanza. \"The first thing everybody asks me is: 'Are you going to clone that?' I tell them you need a living cell. Even if you could get one, a brontosaurus weighs 30 to 50 tons - where would you get a female animal to carry one?\" Dr Holt opposes cloning to bring back the bucardo from a single animal. This would result in a population of genetically identical animals, he warned, with all the dire consequences of inbreeding. If disease or environmental change hit a wild population of clones, hesaid, and one animal died, the chances are they would all die. He questioned whether the complexity and cost of cloning pandas was worthwhile when they could be artificially inseminated, and argued that it was banks of endangered animals' eggs and sperm, rather than tissue, which needed to be created to preserve genetic diversity. On the likes of mammoths, he said: \"We've got enough endangered species which we need to support without bring ing back more which are probably doomed anyway.\" Professor David Macdonald, director of the wildlife conservation unit at Oxford University, was more equivocal. \"These molecular techniques do hold enormous potential for contributing good in ingenious ways to conservation,\" he said. Rescuing lost genes \"There are hierarchies of priorities and, in mine, saving the habitats of existing, viable species is a higher priority. Reconstituting something that's extinct, while having a certain fascination, is less urgent than saving more things from becoming extinct. But I'm not saying this is a waste of time, trivial or wrong.\" Dr Lanza denied he and his colleagues wanted to make cloning the focus of conservation. \"The aim here is not to use cloning to generate large numbers of animals,\" he said. \"Habitat conservation is the cornerstone of all preservation efforts. But this is a tool to rescue genes that would be otherwise lost.\" Species: Panda Status: Endangered. Fewer than a thousand remain in their shrinking natural habitat in south-west China, with 100 in zoos. They have sex rarely, dislike breeding in captivity and are picky eaters. Cloning potential: High. Chinese scientists have produced cloned panda embryos by inserting a panda cell nucleus into a rabbit egg. US scientists hope to use black bear eggs and surrogate mothers. Species: Tasmanian tiger Status: Extinct. The last known representative of this striped, wolf-like marsupial species died in a zoo in Hobart in 1936. Cloning potential: Poor , were it not for the huge effort to bring it back. The New South Wales government has given the Australian Museum in Sydney $1m to do it. But the DNA available for cloning is 134 years old and in bad condition. Species: Barbary lion Status: Unknown. Thought to be the species which devoured Christians in the Roman circus, the last Barbary lion in its natural habitat, north Africa, was killed in Morocco in 1922, but it is thought some may live on in Middle Eastern zoos. Cloning potential: Fair , but only if a survivor can be found, or genes can be recovered from hybrids. Species: Mammoth Status: Extinct 4,000 years. The existence of this furry elephant is known only from bones, tusks, frozen remains in Siberia and cave drawings. Cloning potential: Poor. Scientists hope to get a crack at injecting an elephant egg with DNA from a frozen mammoth cell, but the DNA is likely to be damaged by its time in the permafrost.",

      "bodyText": "Three anti-nuclear protesters who escaped a conviction for criminal damage by arguing that they were justified in trying to destroy illegal weapons of mass destruction will go back to court today in an important test case on whether international law can provide a defence in a UK criminal court. Angela Zelter, Ellen Moxley and Ulla Roder boarded the floating laboratory Maytime, part of the Trident nuclear submarine programme, in June 1999 and threw equipment worth several hundred thousand pounds into Loch Goil. The lab researches, tests and maintains Trident's ability to remain undetected underwater. The three were charged with criminal damage and sent for trial at Greenock sheriff court in October 1999. They admitted causing damage but argued they had no criminal intent. Their defence was that they were acting to prevent a greater crime by disarming illegal weapons of mass destruction. Sheriff Margaret Gimblett directed the jury to acquit them. She ruled that there was no criminal intent in their action because it was based on a belief that they were acting against a continuing criminal conspiracy to contravene international humanitarian law. Now the lord advocate, who heads Scotland's prosecution system, is challenging the surprise ruling in a five-day hearing which opens in the high court in Edinburgh today. He will use a device invoked in only around one case a year - the lord advocate's reference - to seek a decision that the sheriff's ruling was legally wrong. In all six cases in which the reference had been used so far, the high court judges ruled against the trial judge. The outcome of the case will not affect the women's acquittal, but will establish a legal precedent for trial judges in future cases. Ms Zelter is representing herself in the high court proceedings, while the other two will be represented by lawyers. In 1996 the international court of justice, asked for an advisory opinion on the legality of nuclear weapons by the World Health Organisation, concluded: \"The threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflicts, and in particular the principles and rules of international law.\" However, the opinion was limited to times of war. The high court judges will have to decide the answers to four questions. These are: whether evidence about international law can be given in a Scottish criminal prosecution; whether any rule of international law justifies damaging or destroying property because of an objection to nuclear weapons; whether defendants' belief that their actions were justified constitutes a defence; and whether the fact that an offence was committed to prevent a crime by another person is a general defence to a criminal charge. Even if the judges rule that such a defence cannot be used in future cases, there will be nothing to prevent juries acquitting if they sympathise with the defendants, even if they have no valid defence in law. The women belong to Trident Ploughshares, a UK-based campaign whose members from 14 countries pledge to \"prevent nuclear crime by engaging in peaceful acts of practical disarmament\". \u0095 Atomic energy chiefs are preparing to announce how they intend to decommission the Dounreay nuclear reprocessing plant, in the north of Scotland, which is due to close in 2004. The decommissioning of the site is estimated to cost \u00a34bn and is deemed likely to take as much as 60 years to complete. Environmental lobbyists were yesterday putting pressure on the UK atomic energy authority, which owns the reprocessing plant, not to start reprocessing fuel as part of the shutdown procedure.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Yeltsin's literary heroes as he grew up in Stalin's Russia evidently left a lasting mark on the iconoclast who would smash Soviet communism - and in his view they live on, in the person of the former KGB career officer now running Russia. Vladimir Putin, says the third volume of Mr Yeltsin's memoirs, launched at the weekend at a glittering gathering in a villa overlooking Moscow, is the very embodiment of the class of tough young military officer that Mr Yeltsin read about as an adolescent in the Urals 50 years ago. The Presidential Marathon, or Midnight Diaries, as the English edition is entitled, shows Russia's first president indulging in unabashed hero worship of Russia's second president. Mr Yeltsin comments adoringly on Mr Putin's extraordinary eyes. He handpicked Mr Putin as his successor last New Year's eve, he writes, because Mr Putin reminded him of \"the strong determined generals\" he so enjoyed reading about in the pulp fiction of his Stalinist childhood. Every time Mr Yeltsin confronted a problem in his last years in power, it seems, the solution turned up promptly in the form of Mr Putin. Need a new secret police chief? \"In the summer of 1998 I began to think who should replace [Nikolai] Kovalyev? The answer came instantly: Putin!\" Need a new prime minister? A year later, Mr Yeltsin did. \"Who will support me?\" he puzzled. \"Who will realistically stand behind me? Then I understood - Putin.\" But Mr Putin is not the only vigorous young leader who attracted the flamboyant, wayward ex-president, according to the Yeltsin ghostwriters: he found Bill Clinton \"completely amazing\". Talking of their first encounter in 1993, Mr Yeltsin describes Mr Clinton as a \"young, eternally smiling man who was powerful, energetic and handsome\". Mr Yeltsin claims he could have saved the US president a lot of grief by telling him about a bombshell that landed on his Kremlin desk in 1996 in a cable from the Washington embassy. The Republicans were preparing a \"honey-trap\" seduction of President Clinton by a young woman. \"Monica Lewinsky?\" asked the German newspaper, Welt am Sonntag. \"Yes,\" said Mr Yeltsin. \"I could have warned him, but didn't,\" Mr Yeltsin told Russian TV. \"It seemed appalling, immoral. And I didn't want to believe it. Then I thought that Clinton could cope with it himself.\" Referring to his own battles with the bottle, Mr Yeltsin, 69, admits that he resorted to vodka to relieve the stresses of office since his almost nine years as president were like a \"40,000-kilometre marathon\". But these days, he insists, he keeps from getting sozzled, sticking - on doctor's orders - to a glass of wine a day.",

Could it be that this person belonged to the Portillo/inclusivist wing of the party, now locked in battle with the fundamentalist forces of the shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe? If so, the mischief-maker struck gold. Seven members of William Hague's shadow cabinet (or six and a half, if you accept Oliver Letwin's defence that he did so by accident) pleaded guilty as charged, thus knocking a sizeable hole in Ms Widdecombe's case for on-the-spot fines for anyone caught in possession of cannabis - and also in her reputation.</p> <p>Ms Widdecombe has two defences to offer. Of course she did not set out to target people like Messrs Maude, Willetts, Norman and Ainsworth, and Lord Strathclyde, who dabbled at university, or Bernard Jenkin, who abstained at university but succumbed while working for Ford. She is after bad people who deal in drugs in big cities. And of course she cleared her initiative both with Mr Hague and Mr Portillo. But the way she put it across is her responsibility. And the message which stuck at Bournemouth was that the threat was inclusive: that anyone, tomorrow's Tory frontbenchers by no means excluded, who messed with this stuff in future stood to pay a penalty. And that could catch a vast swathe of potential Conservative voters.</p> <p>That ought to serve as a necessary lesson, both for her and even more for her adulators in the party, where surveys suggest she outscores Mr Portillo as a possible Conservative leader. Ann Widdecombe is a natural, a character, a card, a woman utterly unreinventable by spin doctors or image consultants. That is why many people like and admire her. But she is also a headstrong bigot. With a doomed opposition these things may pass by unregarded. With a party aspiring to government, people begin to notice. The roll-your-own deflation of her previous reputation which this incident looks to have engineered is both overdue and deserved. And that is not, by the way, to be read as an endorsement of Michael Portillo.</p>",

Could it be that this person belonged to the Portillo/inclusivist wing of the party, now locked in battle with the fundamentalist forces of the shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe? If so, the mischief-maker struck gold. Seven members of William Hague's shadow cabinet (or six and a half, if you accept Oliver Letwin's defence that he did so by accident) pleaded guilty as charged, thus knocking a sizeable hole in Ms Widdecombe's case for on-the-spot fines for anyone caught in possession of cannabis - and also in her reputation. Ms Widdecombe has two defences to offer. Of course she did not set out to target people like Messrs Maude, Willetts, Norman and Ainsworth, and Lord Strathclyde, who dabbled at university, or Bernard Jenkin, who abstained at university but succumbed while working for Ford. She is after bad people who deal in drugs in big cities. And of course she cleared her initiative both with Mr Hague and Mr Portillo. But the way she put it across is her responsibility. And the message which stuck at Bournemouth was that the threat was inclusive: that anyone, tomorrow's Tory frontbenchers by no means excluded, who messed with this stuff in future stood to pay a penalty. And that could catch a vast swathe of potential Conservative voters. That ought to serve as a necessary lesson, both for her and even more for her adulators in the party, where surveys suggest she outscores Mr Portillo as a possible Conservative leader. Ann Widdecombe is a natural, a character, a card, a woman utterly unreinventable by spin doctors or image consultants. That is why many people like and admire her. But she is also a headstrong bigot. With a doomed opposition these things may pass by unregarded. With a party aspiring to government, people begin to notice. The roll-your-own deflation of her previous reputation which this incident looks to have engineered is both overdue and deserved. And that is not, by the way, to be read as an endorsement of Michael Portillo.",

He is represented in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, but much of his work has gone abroad to the Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Australian National Gallery, Canberra.</p> <p>For Henderson, \"fluxed earth\", as he called clay, was capable of being stretched and teased into complex new forms. His construction methods produced objects with a multiplicity of colour and textures, edges and interior spaces. His mastery of form was based on his insights as a painter, and he always stressed drawing as the key to his three-dimensional achievements. His intense, visceral vision was born out of his love of the natural world; he believed in making art that asked new questions. Henderson had a restless, outspoken personality.</p> <p>He came late to art. He was born in Staffordshire, to a Scottish medical family (his father was a GP in a grim mental hospital). Ewen and his brother boarded at a grammar school, and he did his National Service in the RAF, in north Germany.

      "bodyText": "Ewen Henderson, who has died aged 66, had an international reputation as a sculptor who took clay into a new expressiveness. He is represented in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, but much of his work has gone abroad to the Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Australian National Gallery, Canberra. For Henderson, \"fluxed earth\", as he called clay, was capable of being stretched and teased into complex new forms. His construction methods produced objects with a multiplicity of colour and textures, edges and interior spaces. His mastery of form was based on his insights as a painter, and he always stressed drawing as the key to his three-dimensional achievements. His intense, visceral vision was born out of his love of the natural world; he believed in making art that asked new questions. Henderson had a restless, outspoken personality. He came late to art. He was born in Staffordshire, to a Scottish medical family (his father was a GP in a grim mental hospital). Ewen and his brother boarded at a grammar school, and he did his National Service in the RAF, in north Germany. After, he went to work for a Yorkshire chemical company before moving to Cardiff to run a branch specialising in timber preservation, and later said of this time: \"I was guilty of making unrottable revolting houses in Newport which should have been allowed to rot very quickly.\" Meanwhile an interest in classical and contemporary music was developing.

      "body": "<p> 'Of all the Earth's predators known and feared, none is more shrouded in mystery than the great white shark,\" said the narrator of <strong> Great White Down Under</strong> (Discovery Channel, Sun), in tones unilaterally reserved for Scary Subjects. At Narrator School, there must be a whole syllabus devoted to the tones for aspiring voiceover artistes when discussing spiders, forest fires, the possibility of robots taking over the world and \"the merciless killing machines of the deep\". (The deep, you'll notice, not \"the sea\" or \"the oceans\". At Narrator School, nuance is everything.) </p> <p>Discovery's Shark Weekend did the usual associated with documentaries on scary subjects, and was perversely jolly for it. It scared the bejeesus out of us with footage of sharks attacking cameramen in underwater cages, and photographs of attack victims with serrated semi-circular chunks taken out of their legs. It had technicolour coral paradises invaded by shoals of viciously grinning sharks who proceeded to wolf down unsuspecting stripy fish. It even showed biologists like Barry, Hamish and - my personal favourite - Dr Rocky Strong, using modern technology to track and learn more about \"these enigmatic beasts\". </p> <p>Yet in its aim to explain, what Discovery's shark extravaganza did more than anything else was affirm the notion that, despite scientists' efforts, we still know very little about the animal. And that ignorance was the most scary thing of all. Hence sharks got the most menace-ladened tones imaginable, more than pyromaniacal robot spiders. </p> <p>But at least you know where you are with a shark. With their inkwell eyes and slaughtersome teeth, they're quite obviously not to be messed with. Humans, on the other fin, don't carry such obvious manifestations of their dangerous qualities. </p> <p>\"I don't bite,\" grinned Mr Chambers, the avuncular children's home warden in <strong> Care </strong> (BBC2, Sun). No, he did much worse than that, as his unsuspecting charge, Davey, would find out. Along with countless others at the home where he was incarcerated, Davey was used and abused by men entrusted with his welfare. In its exploration of the aftermath of child abuse, as well as its perpetration, Care was a bleak, harrowing, unmissable piece of TV, exceptionally acted and wonderfully directed. A Cathy Come Home for the millennium. </p> <p>At its heart was a stunning performance from Steven Mackintosh as the grown-up Davey struggling to come to terms with his ordeal. Mackintosh moved from little boy lost, eyes almost sewn shut with tears, to raging bull, smashing and bashing those closest to him, a directionless, devastating fury fuelled by guilt, fear, self-doubt and self-loathing. </p> <p>With bewildered support from Maria Pride as Pauline and Jaye Griffiths as Elaine, a campaigning journalist, Mackintosh's Davey remained trapped in a world where there are no merry Christmases, no happy birthdays, no safe places or caring authorities. From his own private hell to humiliation in the law courts, all dark wood and intimidation, the all-too- terrible reality of what actually went on in children's homes all over the country was brought into sharp relief. Corrupt silence and paisley-patterned pyjamas hid - and are still hiding - bleeding arseholes and torn souls. </p> <p>And, in a sign of a most mature drama (and executive producers who know when not to interfere), Bird and Prendiville resisted a happy ending, simply because there isn't one. Of the country's 52 police forces, 42 are investigating allegations of systematic child abuse in children's homes. Evil is such an absolute word to use, but what's the alternative? </p> <p>Tense, perfectly paced and compelling, Care wasn't enjoyable in the slightest, but it was testament to the continuing power of television to raise issues and invigorate debate, to challenge good people to do something so that evil doesn't prevail. Our fears whisper it but, too often, we avert our eyes. Maybe Care will do something to change that. </p> <p>In the end though, Davey was all alone but for a bottle of cheap vodka and an overdose of paracetamol. All alone but for the thousands of other victims of child abuse who feel the same rage, guilt, fear and invisibility. </p> <p>Of all the Earth's predators known and feared, none is more shrouded in mystery than the great white shark?

Cervantes's errant-knight is an inadvertent time-traveller, having been transported in a time machine which also manages to dredge-up old refrigerators, inflatable sex dolls and jars of Christ's blood for the delectation of the future's decadent super-rich. Quixote is hopelessly adrift. Adrift, that is, above the stage of the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona, where the denizens of a fictive Hong Kong view him as an exotic exhibit, a monster in a freak show. </p> <p>With 126 chapters, the entirety of Miguel de Cervantes's novel might have seemed but a blink of that giant eye to some of the more disgruntled members of the audience of Don Quixote en Barcelona, this new, three-act opera at the rebuilt El Liceu on Barcelona's famous Rambla. They were doubtless recalling Nabokov's remark, that Don Quixote is nothing but an encyclopedia of cruelties. The opera might well have reminded them, too, that the refurbished auditorium of the Liceu, rebuilt after the disastrous fire in 1994 which destroyed most of the building, is, with its recreated 19th-century plush and gilded tiers, itself a kind of hi-tech transport of nostalgia. Some of the audience are only happy travelling backwards in time. </p> <p>Now, like the Quixote of this new opera, they've not been given the choice. As the third act unfolds, and the 2005 Barcelona International Congress on Cervantes degenerates into near riots on a wonderfully staged La Rambla, with a hurricane and tidal wave creating an onstage natural disaster, it becomes apparent that Quixote in Barcelona is essentially a metaphoric maelstrom. Some here complain that DQ is not an opera. What is it then? It is a Blade Runner world of gantries, mirrors and grubby future-industrial exteriors. It is part videodrome, part art installation. Everything about this work hits you with a rushing simultaneity of sight, sound and action. </p> <p>What else might have been expected from a production conceived by La Fura dels Baus, the Catalan ensemble who, for more than 20 years, have astonished, terrified and delighted audiences with their violent, cathartic actions and performances around the world? </p> <p>La Fura - who began life as the instigators of street performances in the manner of Viennese Aktionist Herman Nitsch, and who developed their spectacular and alarming rites and trials by fire, water, pitchforks and chainsaws into spectacular public events, most notably for the inauguration of the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, and for the Millennium celebrations - are by now something of an institution, albeit a wayward one. Nor is this their first foray into opera; they staged a version of Faust last year, in Salzburg, and it is a medium for which their energies and ambitions are ideally suited. </p> <p>The real point here seems to be to create that most impure, unwieldy difficult thing: the opera as total art work. Its multiple messages and allusions are concealed within an implausible, complicated structure, just like the multitude of stories buried in Cervantes's digressive, picaresque novel. And for all the technology and the spectacular stagecraft, La Fura's conception is to create more than an animated machine. They know that it is absurd to parody a novel which itself is a series of parodies, but chose to do it anyhow, as though to add but one more layer of twists and turns. </p> <p>I kept being reminded of other works, in other media. That eyeball, for instance, is a dead ringer for a work by Tony Ousler. The dirigible is like a Panamarenko. The rapid-fire montage of video clips set against live action, the splicing of live orchestration and recorded sound (some of which was composed via public participation, via software designed by La Fura, accessed on the internet), feels like familiar territory for the contemporary art buff, but done on a much grander scale than usual. Opera lovers, on the other hand, might see this as Don Quixote in space, or at a disco, or Don Quixote amongst the back-packers, looking for an opera. </p> <p>DQ is astonishing, a ravishing multimedia assault.

I've changed my mind, for a reason I'm not happy about. I'm now convinced (on very good evidence) that the law lords - there would probably have been seven of them - would not have reached a unanimous decision. Nothing would have been more unsatisfactory than a 4-3 or even a 5-2 split on such a sensitive and emotional issue, especially as each of their Lordships would probably have wanted to give his own - perhaps differing - reasons. Far from being clarified, the law might well have become more confused, and continuingly controversial. That's not a healthy reason for feeling relieved that the law lords won't be ruling.</p> <p>\u0095 When This Life was on television a couple of years ago, the Law Society was bombarded with requests from young people wanting to become lawyers, just like the characters in the series. Their enthusiasm waned when they were told that sexual promiscuity and the ability to smoke 60 a day were not the only criteria for entering the profession. The further news that a certain modicum of legal knowledge would be required, and even the passing of a few exams, finally killed their interest. Now we have another series about young lawyers, which may re-awaken the attraction of the law as a cool career. North Square, set in Leeds, starts on Channel 4 on October 18. I've seen two episodes and enjoyed them, and I've got to admit that the barristers in this set of chambers are less adept at random sex and smoking than their London counterparts. But they do swear quite a lot, fight each other in and out of court, have babies and affairs, and suffer Machiavellian office politics. The barristers' chief clerk (played with gusto by Phil Davis) gets all the best lines and will make most viewers want to be him rather than any of the barristers. My usual warning: don't believe most of it. North Square is great fun, but meticulously accurate it ain't. Even in these enlightened times, a pupil (trainee) in her first week of work wouldn't suddenly be called on to take over a criminal trial for which her experienced head of chambers had been hired. Nor would our hero be allowed to play, at full blast and in the barristers robing room, his CD of My Father Was a Robber.</p> <p>\u0095 I 'm delighted to return to a topic which once played a large part in these columns: the fate of London's only gentlemen's pissoir (or vespasian , if you prefer, after the Roman Emperor who introduced them) to be a listed structure. It is green, late Victorian, and erected against the outer wall of Lincoln's Inn. I was reminded of the convenience when leafing through an entertaining new book, The Walking Guide to Lawyers' London, by Andrew Goodman (Blackstone Press). As it happens, the pissoir is missing from the book (which is probably its only omission, so comprehensive does it seem in every other aspect). It was once a much patronised facility by some of the great judges of the last century; I have personally made satisfying use of it next to a Master of the Rolls and (on a different occasion) a Lord Chief Justice. It was closed when building works were carried out in the vicinity, but didn't re-open for business when the works were done. I will now make it my life's work to find out what has happened and to campaign for its re-opening. Such a stream of legal history ought not to be allowed to be washed away.</p> <p>\u0095 In what city is the European Court of Human Rights? The question was asked last week on the veteran Radio Four programme Brain of Britain. I was genuinely shocked when none of the four competitors (all men) knew. The Hague, Luxembourg and Brussels were offered. The answer is Strasbourg. Even though that programme was recorded weeks ago, before the most recent flurry of publicity about the European Convention on Human Rights being incorporated here, it's not as if there had been silence before. In the past couple of years, the convention and the court in Strasbourg that interprets it have rarely been out of the news, at least in the broadsheet papers.

I Am a Coffee was, well, decaffeinated. Then 1998's Horses for Courses featured cossack dancing, but no racing nags. For their titles, says David Sant (for those who've seen the shows, he's the loudmouthed one), Peepolykus choose \"whatever rolls in the mouth\". About the only thing that can be guaranteed regarding their latest work, Goose Nights, is that avian appearances will be few and far between. </p> <p>The oddball titles are a necessity. Whereas funding bodies and venues need details of their work months in advance, Peepolykus's anarcho-slapstick offerings are improvised from scratch in rehearsal and subject to chaotic developments on stage. The company's many fans - at home and, increasingly, abroad - wouldn't have it any other way. How else but spon taneously would Sant and Javier Marzan, in Let the Donkey Go, have thought to balance a mountain of Rich Tea biscuits on John Nicholson's jaw? Or - in I Am a Coffee - to send their co-star's head spiralling from an operating table into the audience's lap? Such golden theatrical moments almost never happened. After the split-up of Peepolykus Mark 1, a company he formed after circus school with \"some Swiss people\", Nicholson (the bumbling one) was set to begin a career in primary education. </p> <p>He got as far as the interview, before recruiting Spaniards Sant and Marzan - previously fellow students at London's cosmopolitan Philippe Gaulier theatre school, now performers with the likes of Told By an Idiot and Trestle Theatre - for one last heave towards comic glory. </p> <p>Locking themselves in a rehearsal room, the trio devised Let the Donkey Go, a lunatic collection of antics strung around the adventures of a defector from fictional Rajmanistan. Donkey rejoiced in its refusal to take anything seriously, so it's a surprise to learn that it was inspired by an article (\"From the Guardian, in fact,\" says Nicholson) about the crew of a Russian ship who killed their stowaways rather than face a fine for bringing them ashore. Says Marzan: \"We kept saying, 'Let's put something significant in here.'\" According to Sant, \"it was very difficult to really go 100 % for silliness\". Nicholson, who cites the Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy as influences, says he \"comes up against this time and again - 'Let's do something that has a bit more resonance.' But what we've come to realise is that the resonance that we really enjoy is to do with comedy. Our material is so ridiculous it actually gets inside people.\" </p> <p>Like Stan and Ollie, the characters they play are united in their madcap world by friendship as well as shared stupidity. Nicholson wants audience members to think: \"I feel comfortable with these people. I feel they're genuinely enjoying themselves and are involving me in their world.\" He wants to create the kind of the show where the audience \"feels touched\". </p> <p>The trio's backgrounds are all theatrical, and much of Peepolykus's best work involves the mangling of dramatic convention, from a standpoint of qualified affection. \"Classic plays well done can be fantastic,\" says Marzan, \"but there's a lot of big companies doing them like cakes, really. At least our clowns, if they don't succeed, they try with more heart.\" </p> <p>The company's attachment to the theatre rather than the stand-up scene may be why Peepolykus remain relatively unknown after five years in the business. For, while cabaret is increasingly borrowing theatre's clothes (witness Garth Marenghi's Fright Knight, a comic play in all but name), it remains tough for companies who straddle that divide to make their name. \"We're too theatrical to be comedy,\" says Nicholson, \"and, to hardline theatre people, we can't be theatre because we're just mucking around.\" </p> <p>Goose Nights represents a change of tack. \"We've always wanted to do a show that had a really meaty story,\" says Nicholson, \"but whenever we tried, we got so stuck in the story that we couldn't muck around.\" The source material, Labours of Hercules, is rich in event and ripe with solemn theatrical traditions to goof. \"We could have done a 10-hour show,\" says Sant. In the final, 90-minute version, the hero is a hapless Greek waiter and Demis Roussos has a cameo. </p> <p>The three sense that for wider acclaim they'll have to crack TV. \"The key in live performance,\" says Sant, \"is that we see the audience's eyes, we see their reaction - it's easy to know what's going on. You can't do that on TV.\" </p> <p>But you can distil its spirit. Given the chance to do so, Peepolykus could be a Morecambe and Wise in triplicate for the 21st century.</p> <p>\u0095 Goose Nights opens at the Lyric Studio, Hammersmith, London W6 (020-8741 2311), tonight and runs till October 28.</p>",

Nicholson, who cites the Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy as influences, says he \"comes up against this time and again - 'Let's do something that has a bit more resonance.' But what we've come to realise is that the resonance that we really enjoy is to do with comedy. Our material is so ridiculous it actually gets inside people.\" Like Stan and Ollie, the characters they play are united in their madcap world by friendship as well as shared stupidity. Nicholson wants audience members to think: \"I feel comfortable with these people. I feel they're genuinely enjoying themselves and are involving me in their world.\" He wants to create the kind of the show where the audience \"feels touched\". The trio's backgrounds are all theatrical, and much of Peepolykus's best work involves the mangling of dramatic convention, from a standpoint of qualified affection. \"Classic plays well done can be fantastic,\" says Marzan, \"but there's a lot of big companies doing them like cakes, really. At least our clowns, if they don't succeed, they try with more heart.\" The company's attachment to the theatre rather than the stand-up scene may be why Peepolykus remain relatively unknown after five years in the business. For, while cabaret is increasingly borrowing theatre's clothes (witness Garth Marenghi's Fright Knight, a comic play in all but name), it remains tough for companies who straddle that divide to make their name. \"We're too theatrical to be comedy,\" says Nicholson, \"and, to hardline theatre people, we can't be theatre because we're just mucking around.\" Goose Nights represents a change of tack. \"We've always wanted to do a show that had a really meaty story,\" says Nicholson, \"but whenever we tried, we got so stuck in the story that we couldn't muck around.\" The source material, Labours of Hercules, is rich in event and ripe with solemn theatrical traditions to goof. \"We could have done a 10-hour show,\" says Sant. In the final, 90-minute version, the hero is a hapless Greek waiter and Demis Roussos has a cameo. The three sense that for wider acclaim they'll have to crack TV. \"The key in live performance,\" says Sant, \"is that we see the audience's eyes, we see their reaction - it's easy to know what's going on. You can't do that on TV.\" But you can distil its spirit. Given the chance to do so, Peepolykus could be a Morecambe and Wise in triplicate for the 21st century. \u0095 Goose Nights opens at the Lyric Studio, Hammersmith, London W6 (020-8741 2311), tonight and runs till October 28.",

We take our old industrial past, dust it down, clean it up and transform it into our own vision of a future where there is time to stop and stare. Where there once stood great machines there is now art. Hallelujah. </p> <p>Following Tate Modern comes the Wapping Project, a new centre for the arts based in the old Wapping Hydraulic Power Station in east London. This is an area of London upon which the economy of Empire relied - our own industrial Venice, a complex network of waterways and working-class histories and homes. The Hydraulic power station shows us how London worked. </p> <p>The Hydraulic power station was built in 1890, opposite the Prospect of Whitby pub, London's oldest surviving riverside inn, built in 1543 and originally known as the Devil's Tavern. The pub has the air of a rural cottage transposed to the city, and the Victorian power station, with its mellow brickwork and folly-like, creeper-clad tower even more so, as if its designers wanted to disguise the power that was housed within. And make no mistake, it was power. Coal delivered to the adjacent Shadwell Basin was used to fire six steam boilers and their pumping engines. The station provided power not just to the surrounding docks but throughout central London. It was the envy of a power-hungry world and was the model for similar stations as far afield as New York and Argentina. </p> <p>The introduction of two electric turbine pumps in 1923 heralded the station's heyday. More than 33m gallons of water a week were pumped underneath the streets of London. Tower Bridge depended on hydraulic power, the revolving stages of both the London Palladium and the Coliseum were powered hydraulically, as were numerous lifts in City offices and West End department stores and the organ console at the Odeon Marble Arch. </p> <p>But the arrival in mid-century of cheaper electricity spelled the end for the need for hydraulic power. Such stations began to shut down. The one at Wapping was the very last working hydraulic power station in the world when it closed its doors in 1977. </p> <p>For the next 16 years the building and its contents fell into dereliction. Then on a November morning in 1993, Jules Wright, the artistic director of the Women's Playhouse Trust, on the look out for a suitable building for the Trust, was being taken on a tour of possible sites by the London Docklands Development Corporation. The LDDC then was keen to encourage arts activity in an area that was only just beginning to see signs of regeneration. Wright was tired, the buildings she had already seen were unpromising, but she agreed to the detour to Wapping. She walked through the door, took one look and said: \"I am going to have this place.\" </p> <p>She has, too, even though the lottery turned down her application for funding - up against competition from projects such as the Royal Opera House and Sadler's Wells in the first dash for lottery loot. Almost every penny of the \u00a34m the building has cost so far she has raised herself. Wright, who moved to London from Australia in 1974, isn't entirely sorry about the lack of public funding. \"I do like not having to spend my life ticking little boxes and doing what other people tell you,\" she says, with typical Australian forthrightness. She waves an arm expansively: \"Who knows, if we had had \u00a328m rather than \u00a34m, we might have wrecked the place.\" </p> <p>Wright, and her architects Shed 54 Limited, led by her husband Joshua Wright, haven't. The building is as idiosyncratic as Wright herself. And it is dense with atmosphere. The aim has been to keep as much of the existing building structure and machinery as possible, and to maintain both the atmosphere of the power station's industrial past and the archeological detail that underpins it. </p> <p>Wright describes the architects' job as matching \"the functional purity of the original. Their work is often quiet to the point of self-effacement. In some ways self-effacement is its point, simply reinforcing the existing forms, shapes and volumes and emphasising the industrial scale so that their work relates to the building, not to the human scale.\" </p> <p>There is an air of architectural impermanence in stairs that do not touch the ground but appear to float and others made from untreated steel that will eventually achieve a dusting of rust. But just as the conversion of the building plays constant homage to its history and its watery past, so its contents will too. </p> <p>The transformation of the boiler and filter houses, both stripped back to their 1890 form, has created exhibition and performance areas that are potentially the most exciting in London. At last the capital has a space for installation and performance that has the epic sweep of Glasgow's Tramway, and is both functional and eerily beautiful. This is a space that demands an artistic response that is bold, contemporary and radical. </p> <p>The programme kicks off with WPC's commission of Jane Prophet's installation Conductor, which provides the link between the building's industrial past and its new life as a cultural centre. For Conductor, 120 lengths of fibre optic cables are suspended above the flooded floor of the former boiler house so that they are reflected to a seemingly infinite depth that is intermittently disrupted by ripples created by the action of a water pump. </p> <p>It seems a long way from the founding of the WPT and its first ever production, a revival of Aphra Behn's rarely performed restoration satire The Lucky Chance, at the Royal Court in 1984. Yet just as that production was about reclaiming the dispossessed past, the work of WPT has also always been about ensuring that women have a place - and a space - right in the forefront of Britain's cultural life. </p> <p>\"I have never been interested in the WPT doing hole-in-the-wall work. Women artists need big opportunities,\" says Wright. The tide may go in and out when it comes to the profile of women in the arts, but expect plenty of ripples emanating from Wapping in the coming months. </p> <p>\u0095 The Wapping Project opens on Saturday.

      "body": "<p>Margaret Thatcher knew from the start that I wasn't likely to be \"one of us\". I worked for the Sunday Times, then an independent and liberal paper. I had all the wrong instincts, being neither a Conservative nor someone who believed political journalists should have other than sceptical connections with politicians. About the only thing we had in common was a birthday. Despite all this, we got on quite well, more to her credit than to mine. </p> <p>It was partly, no doubt, a matter of prudence. The Sunday Times was a very big paper with a lot of politically uncommitted readers. I did several interviews with her when she was prime minister. The first was preceded by her personal search for Nescafe. If that happened at No 10 today, you could be sure there had been a meeting of spin-doctors beforehand, to assess precisely what impression should be made. But the early Thatcher was a cosmetic artefact only when she appeared on television. Her personal coffee-making wasn't, I thought, done for effect. Like her obsession with turning off the Downing Street lights, it was the extension of Grantham housekeeping into the prime ministerial world. </p> <p>There were two reasons, I think, why I survived for 10 years as an acceptable interviewer and occasional off-the record conversationalist. First, Thatcher always liked an argument. It was a mode of discourse she found irresistible. The very fact that I was so plainly not in her camp became a virtue. I was bestowed with \"convictions\", and even principles. Once allotted this label, I never seemed to lose it. </p> <p>One of the things Mrs Thatcher said, intimidatingly, to an early civil servant was that she usually made up her mind about a man in 10 seconds - \"and I rarely change it\". So, perhaps, it was with me. Her encompassing of me within her invincible power of persuasion was due, however, to the second feature of our relationship. I'm sure she never read a word I wrote. I retained my place in the tent of the acceptable because she never knew what I really thought, since she was a stranger to my columns. These became, as the years went by, critical to the point of savagery. I questioned her honesty as much as her wisdom. I impugned her motives, ridiculed her judgment and even cast doubt on her sanity. I remained, unread, within the pale. </p> <p>One thing Thatcher certainly did not read was my biography of her, One of Us. And after all, why should she? Who would want to read what purported to be a detailed account of her life and thought, when knowing that every nuance, however honestly chronicled, was bound to be not quite how it really was. </p> <p>The last time I met her was in what could, nonetheless, be called a biographical context. The occasion was the annual Christmas party given by the American ambassador. A long queue was lining up to shake his hand, and suddenly my wife and I found that Lady Thatcher and her husband had materialised beside us. This wasn't long after she had ceased to be prime minister, and she could still not quite credit that she had to queue at all. A frisson of doubt on her face plainly revealed an inner impulse to march up to the front and be greeted without delay. But Denis decided against such a display of amnesia as to who they now were, and the two of them therefore faced 10 minutes imprisoned in our company. </p> <p> The talk, led by her, immediately turned to writing. This was a subject which used to attract little but her scorn. She once asked me in very public company when I was going to get down to some proper work - building wealth, creating jobs etc - instead of wasting my time with journalism. It was one of the regrets of my life that I had lacked the presence of mind to say: \"After you, prime minister\". </p> <p>But now, she told me, she had just completed the first volume of her memoirs. She was now a writer. The book had been a great labour, she said. But I wouldn't know anything about that, would I? Because I was a professional journalist. I was incredibly lucky, she added with patent reproach. A note of envy was even detectable. It was all so easy for me. </p> <p>She, on the other hand, had had to labour at getting it all down. She had written every line of the first draft herself, she said, although that nice John O'Sullivan had helped her rearrange some of the words into a better order. But it was essentially all her own work. In recent years, she has taken up her life as a politician, albeit surrounded by a court rather than colleagues, and certainly not by journalists invited to give her an argument. Long ago, I resumed my original distance, and she, in more exaggerated form than ever before, the delusions of unchallengeable, world-correcting rightness. But I bask in the moment when, with ego pumping in a new direction, she was briefly \"one of us\", absolving us writers, just for a year or two, from being \"one of them\". </p> <p>\u0095 This essay appears in Memories of Maggie edited by Iain Dale (Politico's Publishing), price \u00a316.99 .

But the early Thatcher was a cosmetic artefact only when she appeared on television. Her personal coffee-making wasn't, I thought, done for effect. Like her obsession with turning off the Downing Street lights, it was the extension of Grantham housekeeping into the prime ministerial world. There were two reasons, I think, why I survived for 10 years as an acceptable interviewer and occasional off-the record conversationalist. First, Thatcher always liked an argument. It was a mode of discourse she found irresistible. The very fact that I was so plainly not in her camp became a virtue. I was bestowed with \"convictions\", and even principles. Once allotted this label, I never seemed to lose it. One of the things Mrs Thatcher said, intimidatingly, to an early civil servant was that she usually made up her mind about a man in 10 seconds - \"and I rarely change it\". So, perhaps, it was with me. Her encompassing of me within her invincible power of persuasion was due, however, to the second feature of our relationship. I'm sure she never read a word I wrote. I retained my place in the tent of the acceptable because she never knew what I really thought, since she was a stranger to my columns. These became, as the years went by, critical to the point of savagery. I questioned her honesty as much as her wisdom. I impugned her motives, ridiculed her judgment and even cast doubt on her sanity. I remained, unread, within the pale. One thing Thatcher certainly did not read was my biography of her, One of Us. And after all, why should she? Who would want to read what purported to be a detailed account of her life and thought, when knowing that every nuance, however honestly chronicled, was bound to be not quite how it really was. The last time I met her was in what could, nonetheless, be called a biographical context. The occasion was the annual Christmas party given by the American ambassador. A long queue was lining up to shake his hand, and suddenly my wife and I found that Lady Thatcher and her husband had materialised beside us. This wasn't long after she had ceased to be prime minister, and she could still not quite credit that she had to queue at all. A frisson of doubt on her face plainly revealed an inner impulse to march up to the front and be greeted without delay. But Denis decided against such a display of amnesia as to who they now were, and the two of them therefore faced 10 minutes imprisoned in our company. The talk, led by her, immediately turned to writing. This was a subject which used to attract little but her scorn. She once asked me in very public company when I was going to get down to some proper work - building wealth, creating jobs etc - instead of wasting my time with journalism. It was one of the regrets of my life that I had lacked the presence of mind to say: \"After you, prime minister\". But now, she told me, she had just completed the first volume of her memoirs. She was now a writer. The book had been a great labour, she said. But I wouldn't know anything about that, would I? Because I was a professional journalist. I was incredibly lucky, she added with patent reproach. A note of envy was even detectable. It was all so easy for me. She, on the other hand, had had to labour at getting it all down. She had written every line of the first draft herself, she said, although that nice John O'Sullivan had helped her rearrange some of the words into a better order. But it was essentially all her own work. In recent years, she has taken up her life as a politician, albeit surrounded by a court rather than colleagues, and certainly not by journalists invited to give her an argument. Long ago, I resumed my original distance, and she, in more exaggerated form than ever before, the delusions of unchallengeable, world-correcting rightness. But I bask in the moment when, with ego pumping in a new direction, she was briefly \"one of us\", absolving us writers, just for a year or two, from being \"one of them\". \u0095 This essay appears in Memories of Maggie edited by Iain Dale (Politico's Publishing), price \u00a316.99 .

      "body": "<p>I met \"dodgy Dave\" seven years ago on the mighty cobalt-blue San Rafael glacier surging down from the northern Patagonian ice sheet, just a few hundred miles from the tip of south America. It was pouring with rain, he was living out of a rucksack, eating unimaginably bad food, climbing mountains, measuring glacier melt and reroofing barns. He couldn't believe his luck. Raleigh International, with help from his local authority, had sent him to a Chilean wilderness to learn the age-old British establishment arts of initiative training, teamwork and character-building.</p> <p>Dave, frankly, didn't care much for the outdoor life. But he knew about survival, specifically on the streets of Newcastle upon Tyne. Like Prince William, who has just arrived at San Rafael to begin his 10-week expedition in Patagonia, he was one of Raleigh International's \"venturers\", but one of the few who come from what Raleigh call \"at risk\" backgrounds.</p> <p>Dave, like Prince William, came to Chile with a personal history that most of the 17 to 25 year olds who go on to Raleigh's 10 annual expeditions could only gasp at. By 18, he had been in and out of reform schools and been done several times for nicking cars. Now 23 and unemployed, he hadn't told Raleigh the real reason why he wanted to come.</p> <p>Some bloke in Newcastle, he said, had asked him to deliver a package to Manchester and Dave, foolishly, had opened it and then even more foolishly substituted something. \"They\" were after him big-time, he said. Dave was on the run and the safest place in the world for him was among the glaciers and the international kids.</p> <p>Where most of the other venturers came from middle-class homes, were straight out of school and the pony club or doing a gap year before or after university, he was tough as nails. He felt an academic and social oddball but as the weeks went on he joined in the Cilla Black impersonations, learned to like - if not love - the daily porridge and sardines, and opened up to the madcap enthusiasm. Between the real physical adventures and the campfire culture, he was haunted about what would happen when he got back. \"Maybe I'll just carry on travelling,\" he said. \"I could go on to America, anywhere. It's OK for most of these people. The trouble is that I can't hide.\"</p> <p>Dave could scarcely believe how sheltered, naive or plain ignorant the majority of the British venturers were. Some had worked hard to raise the \u00a34,000 needed to come, but others had raised the cash in a single party for friends or, like Prince William, had got help from Dad. Some had never left home, or even camped before, others were more at home on a pony or in a lecture hall. Some were public school high-fliers being sponsored by international companies and were trying to advance their carers, yet others saw themselves at personal crossroads - trying to decide what to do or wanting to get out of boring jobs, or relationships.</p> <p>But boy, did they have a good time. Halfway into the 10 weeks almost everyone testified to being happier than ever before. Many had amazed themselves at what they had done. Kayaking through ice flows and camping above the snowline, climbing around glaciers, walking 30 miles a day and making snow shelters and skimming over lagoons in inflatables had stretched most of them. All had caught the adventure bug, and with many of the hunky or horsey volunteer minders falling in love with each other, it made for a heady brew. \"It was like being on another planet\", said Martin, a 20-year-old from Kent.</p> <p>\"It was a seminal period of my life,\" says Kirsty Monro from Ilkley in Yorkshire, who was in Chile in 1993. Now an artist living in Majorca, she says: \"I'd repeat it a million times. You're put out of real life into a wilderness. You learn about yourself, your limits, you find out your abilities. Some people had never left home. You learn how to be with people. I felt like I lived a million lives in months.\"</p> <p>Monro recognised she was lucky finding a group of friends who are still with her seven years on. \"Some groups who go on a Raleigh expedition just don't mix. Some people have a miserable time, some get stuck with people they cannot stand. People had tantrums. It was a lottery.\"</p> <p>Raleigh takes about 1,000 17 to 25 year olds on 10 expeditions a year. When Prince Charles started it in 1978, it was run by the eccentric Colonel Blashford-Snell on strict military lines and was shamelessly adventure-oriented. Now led by Jamie Robertson-Macleod, a former Green Jacket captain and equerry to Prince Rainier of Monaco, it is billed as an international development charity and emphasises the environmental and social works the youths are expected to do.</p> <p>If anything, it has become more establishment, a youth wing of the diplomatic corps and a recruiting ground for the British army. Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe and others have attested in parliament to the \"real benefits for UK foreign policy\" that volunteering of this kind can bring.</p> <p>Raleigh gets much of its money from the government via the Darwin Initiative, UN bodies, the European commission, and everyone from the Lions Club to the Freemasons of Yorkshire. Its main \"sponsor\" in the past decade has been Inchcape, the world's largest distributor of cars. It draws heavily on former armed service personnel and recruits many of its volunteer helpers from the SAS and civil service with the Ministry of Defence sponsoring some venturers. It tends to take its expeditions to countries which Britain likes to do lucrative arms business with, many of which have or have known dictatorships. In the past few years, it has been to Indonesia, Oman, Brunei, Namibia, and Angola.</p> <p>Last year it was linked more formally to the army who will from now on fund 20 places a year for \"at risk, disadvantaged\" children, such as Dave, in return for \"helping the army raise awareness of its career opportunities among Raleigh participants\".</p> <p>The new internationalism which it espouses, tries to marry British interests abroad with personal development and good works for the needy. Wherever Raleigh goes, it is feted by embassies and local politicians. In Chile, General Pinochet just happened to land on the glacier in a helicopter as Dave and the venturers were heading that way. Prince Charles himself dropped in on one Oman group last year. The Sultan of Brunei is an admirer, as are other heads of state. Says Robertson-Macleod: \"People say that we are ambassadors.\"</p> <p>For the venturers who tend to stick to their social strata, it can be one long diplomatic party. One group in Oman, dubbed the \"dinner party set\", reported that it had found time to do its own own entertaining, go to the horse races and concerts, and be entertained by in the British embassy.</p> <p>But Raleigh International's semi-diplomatic status is also one of its problems. All the social and environmental work done by the venturers is with the guidance of the local min istries who are often out of contact themselves with the needs of local people. The locals often respond to the arrival of gangs of whites with a mixture of bemusement and semi-resentment.</p> <p>Raleigh volunteers were recently sent to Mount Elgon national park in Uganda to build a camping lodge for tourists. The report from the locals was not complimentary: \"The major criticism of the present development strategy [in the park] is the use of Raleigh International in the construction of tourist facilities. The applicability of a group of 12 European office workers for five weeks to build a campsite is questionable with regards sustainability. This phenomenon could be termed aid tourism, the desire of westerners to do charitable work in the developing world, with personal development a primary objective.</p> <p>\"The work of Raleigh expeditions may be of value to the nation, but as a group they are misunderstood by the local communities. Rather than assisting development they are viewed as actively taking work away from the locals. One venturer suggested that the guides and porters could organise themselves into an association and, among other activities, carry out the work their expedition was completing,\" said one member of the park staff.</p> <p>In Chile, the task for one group while I was there was to rebuild a barn which had been destroyed several years previously following a volcanic eruption. The local farmer had provided new beech shingles tiles and watched in amazement as 25 peo ple with no knowledge of carpentry or roofing proceeded to botch the job in record time. It would be a miracle if that barn is still standing today.</p> <p>Robertson-Macleod says that the number of complaints Raleigh has today is \"far fewer\" than seven years ago. He admits that in the early days Raleigh was often not sophisticated. \"We know we have a lot to learn. We don't want to be building things that are not needed. We need community interaction. People are generally very happy with our work. On an average expedition to Africa now, 30% of the venturers are from the host country. We are not telling people what they should do. The idea of venturers being patronising or colonial is just wrong.\"</p> <p>Most of the work building schools, dams, or old people's homes, helping local or British scientists, he says, would not be done were it not for Raleigh. Nevertheless, the venturers I was with were given no briefing of the politics of the country, no overview of the wider social or physical environment and no expectation was made of them to learn the local languages.</p> <p>Prince William has now arrived in Patagonia and, says Robertson Macleod, there are \"amazing\" stories coming back of how well the expedition is going - which he will not share because St James's palace would \"skin\" him. What happens when the prince returns will be another matter: many of the venturers say they find it hard to readjust. Many change jobs and lifestyles.</p> <p>For Dave, it didn't work out too well. He was last heard of in trouble with the police. For Prince William, the next 10 weeks will be reality suspended, a mix of sheer bliss, utter terror at the physical extremes and, just like Dave, a very uncertain homecoming.</p>",

It would have a real stiffening effect in Saigon and a strong signal effect to Hanoi.\"</p> <p>Five weeks later America launched Operation Rolling Thunder, its sustained aerial bombardment of North Vietnam. A month after that, 20,000 more US troops were landed, reinforced by others from Australia and South Korea. By the middle of the year, America's forces had reached 125,000 and President Johnson had to double the number of young men facing conscription. The nation was irrevocably committed to the disaster of the Vietnam war.</p> <p>The author of that decisive memorandum was William Bundy, who has died aged 83. He later acknowledged the policy he had recommended was \"a tragedy waiting to happen\". But he did not really recant, commenting a quarter of a century later that \"I was never able to convince myself that there was a cost-free alternative course\".</p> <p>In spite of his enormous influence within the Johnson administration, the president pretended to forget his name and called him \"that other Bundy\" - a wounding reminder of William's high- flying younger brother, McGeorge (who died four years ago).

      "bodyText": "The American secretary of state, Dean Rusk, received a memo from a senior official on January 6, 1965, preparing for a crucial meeting that afternoon with President Johnson. The key passage informed Rusk (and, by implication, the president) that \"the introduction of limited US ground forces in the northern area of South Vietnam still has a great appeal for many of us, concurrently with the first air attacks into [North Vietnam] ... It would have a real stiffening effect in Saigon and a strong signal effect to Hanoi.\" Five weeks later America launched Operation Rolling Thunder, its sustained aerial bombardment of North Vietnam. A month after that, 20,000 more US troops were landed, reinforced by others from Australia and South Korea. By the middle of the year, America's forces had reached 125,000 and President Johnson had to double the number of young men facing conscription. The nation was irrevocably committed to the disaster of the Vietnam war. The author of that decisive memorandum was William Bundy, who has died aged 83. He later acknowledged the policy he had recommended was \"a tragedy waiting to happen\". But he did not really recant, commenting a quarter of a century later that \"I was never able to convince myself that there was a cost-free alternative course\". In spite of his enormous influence within the Johnson administration, the president pretended to forget his name and called him \"that other Bundy\" - a wounding reminder of William's high- flying younger brother, McGeorge (who died four years ago). William was the state department's assistant secretary for East Asia, his brother the president's powerful national security adviser, a position he had also held under Kennedy. McGeorge's shadow fell across William from their early childhood. They came from a family of Boston brahmins, related to the vastly influential Cabots and Lowells. William went to Groton, Yale, and Harvard Law School and emerged as \"everyone's ideal of the New England gentleman, tall, handsome, fresh-faced, and courteous\" - a description offered by an English colleague at the Bletchley code-breaking centre, to which Bundy was seconded during the second world war.

Perhaps she should simply call the fine a licence fee, and relieve the police by creating cannabis detector vans. Gareth Davies Gateshead gareth@newportrfc.zzn.com \u0095 May I suggest that every member of the Tory party who has ever smoked pot pays a \u00a3100 \"conscience fine\" to Conservative central office? It would give the Tories a good fighting fund. Geoff Wicks Basildon, Essex \u0095 I was intrigued that most of the contributors to your article Where there's smoke (G2, October 6) used smoking as an excuse not to have used cannabis more. Surely most of them enjoy a piece of cake with their cup of tea? Mike Lowcock Wistaston, Cheshire \u0095 We can only assume William Hague was too drunk to hold the joint to his lips. Michael Poppleton Annily Campbell Denton, Northants \u0095 If cannabis is legalised, please can advertising it be made illegal - sparing us from pictures of flying cowboys, torn psychedelic satin cloths and whatever else would be deemed appropriate by agencies for branding the product. Muriel de Grey Milton Keynes, Bucks \u0095 You inform us that the sales of Rizla cigarette papers have grown despite the decline of sales of rolling tobacco. The increase could be accounted for by the purchase of cigarette papers by my daughter, who uses them to poke under the keys of her clarinet. Isabel Malin Barmby Moor, Yorkshire",

      "body": "<p>Elaine is in a wheelchair and is being swung through a set of double doors. Her husband Jim trails behind carrying a bottle of Irn Bru and a bundle of clothing. </p> <p>A midwife, keeping apace of them, is saying: \"Just take big breaths Elaine, you are doing fine.\" A colleague is running, grabbing maternity pads, some other bits and pieces, a rubber hat to pull over her hair. </p> <p>This is a calm birth. The kind that is easy and goes perfectly well, for both mother and midwife. After this burst of final, nervous activity, Elaine and her husband have a new son, James, their fifth. \"I have my own football team now,\" laughs the dad. </p> <p>Childbirth - assuming there are no real complications - should mostly always be like this. But it rarely is. Lack of staff and resources mean that often the midwife is too stretched. </p> <p>James was born in a small midwife-led birthing unit designed to make uncomplicated births a pleasant experience. But sometimes, staffing is so short the unit has to be shut down. It is a pattern that has become familiar in maternity units and hospitals across the country. </p> <p>James was born in Glasgow royal maternity hospital, known locally as Rottenrow because of the name of the street the place has stood on since it was built in 1834. He is the latest of the 500,000 Glaswegians who have been born there. With an average of 15 to 16 births a day, it is Glasgow's busiest maternity hospital. </p> <p>Rottenrow serves a huge swath of the city. Around 50% of its patients come from socially-deprived areas: they are thus seven times more likely to lose their baby and need close midwife care. Next year, staff will be moved to a new \u00a325m unit. But most midwives believe that they will not be able to leave their problems behind. </p> <p>The royal maternity hospital tries to maintain a devolved, community-based service where midwives work in the community and rotate shifts in the hospital. </p> <p>They are involved in ante-natal and post-natal care and also delivery and, as a result, their roles have expanded enormously. But their rewards have not, with most midwives remaining at low grades with low pay and many leaving the service. </p> <p>Liz Terrace has been a midwife for 20 years and is one of the few to be classed as G grade. She is a community-based midwife but also works in the birthing unit. </p> <p>\"There is more asked of a midwife now and there is more skill involved. A midwife is a counsellor, she is an ally, she's a support, she's a practitioner, she's a confidante, she's an educator,\" she explained. </p> <p>Stella Turnbull is working as hospital coordinator for the day which means she oversees the effective running of all the midwives and plugs any gaps that emerge. Her bleeper goes constantly. </p> <p>\"The biggest problem I have is sickness absence and an inability to cover shifts at short notice because there is no slack in the system. It only takes one or two people to phone in at short notice and the whole place would grind to a halt,\" she said. </p> <p>The hospital's clinical director, Alan Mathers, sympathises with what the midwives are saying and knows they are stuck with little chance of promotion. </p> <p>The problem exists across the board in obstetrics and gynaecology, he said. They are \"highly stressful specialities\". </p> <p>He added: \"Maternity services are not regarded very highly by the government and they should be. There has been a big shift in emphasis in just how much of what medicine tries to fix in adult life actually has its origin in foetal development. I feel it would be better to take a more long-term view on how to improve the future.\" </p> <p>In the staff common room, there is a residual resentment. The majority of midwives at Rottenrow are E grades, earning around \u00a319,000 a year with little chance of promotion. The Royal College of Midwives recommends that they should be at least grade F. </p> <p>\"I don't think I would do it over again,\" said one midwife on a teabreak. \"Your lifestyle is dictated to very much by the profession and maybe that's why people are not attracted to it.\" </p> <p>But Liz Terrace countered: \"It can be a very rewarding job and we want to do the job. There can't be many better jobs than delivering someone's baby. It's a life-changing experience for someone and you can be part of that.\"</p>",

James was born in a small midwife-led birthing unit designed to make uncomplicated births a pleasant experience. But sometimes, staffing is so short the unit has to be shut down. It is a pattern that has become familiar in maternity units and hospitals across the country. James was born in Glasgow royal maternity hospital, known locally as Rottenrow because of the name of the street the place has stood on since it was built in 1834. He is the latest of the 500,000 Glaswegians who have been born there. With an average of 15 to 16 births a day, it is Glasgow's busiest maternity hospital. Rottenrow serves a huge swath of the city. Around 50% of its patients come from socially-deprived areas: they are thus seven times more likely to lose their baby and need close midwife care. Next year, staff will be moved to a new \u00a325m unit. But most midwives believe that they will not be able to leave their problems behind. The royal maternity hospital tries to maintain a devolved, community-based service where midwives work in the community and rotate shifts in the hospital. They are involved in ante-natal and post-natal care and also delivery and, as a result, their roles have expanded enormously. But their rewards have not, with most midwives remaining at low grades with low pay and many leaving the service. Liz Terrace has been a midwife for 20 years and is one of the few to be classed as G grade. She is a community-based midwife but also works in the birthing unit. \"There is more asked of a midwife now and there is more skill involved. A midwife is a counsellor, she is an ally, she's a support, she's a practitioner, she's a confidante, she's an educator,\" she explained. Stella Turnbull is working as hospital coordinator for the day which means she oversees the effective running of all the midwives and plugs any gaps that emerge. Her bleeper goes constantly. \"The biggest problem I have is sickness absence and an inability to cover shifts at short notice because there is no slack in the system. It only takes one or two people to phone in at short notice and the whole place would grind to a halt,\" she said. The hospital's clinical director, Alan Mathers, sympathises with what the midwives are saying and knows they are stuck with little chance of promotion. The problem exists across the board in obstetrics and gynaecology, he said. They are \"highly stressful specialities\". He added: \"Maternity services are not regarded very highly by the government and they should be. There has been a big shift in emphasis in just how much of what medicine tries to fix in adult life actually has its origin in foetal development. I feel it would be better to take a more long-term view on how to improve the future.\" In the staff common room, there is a residual resentment. The majority of midwives at Rottenrow are E grades, earning around \u00a319,000 a year with little chance of promotion. The Royal College of Midwives recommends that they should be at least grade F. \"I don't think I would do it over again,\" said one midwife on a teabreak. \"Your lifestyle is dictated to very much by the profession and maybe that's why people are not attracted to it.\" But Liz Terrace countered: \"It can be a very rewarding job and we want to do the job. There can't be many better jobs than delivering someone's baby. It's a life-changing experience for someone and you can be part of that.\"",

      "byline": "Peter Lennon",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> A scene of dreamy serenity is not one you readily associate with Macaulay Culkin, the biggest child star since Shirley Temple, whose career disintegrated six years ago. But there he was below us on the stage of the Vaudeville with his co-star Ir\u00e8ne Jacob (the star of Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colours: Red), patiently playing a little low-key verbal ping pong while the technical crew worked out the lighting. </p> <p>If ever there was a context for petulance or tantrums, this was it. During a technical run-through the actors are nothing but objects to be lit, expected to do their moves and say their lines unemphatically over and over, with no one really listening. Every now and then a voice from below told them to take it from some point where the light was not quite right and they began again, in playful exchanges, savouring their lines for pitch and rhythm, getting the feel of the old British theatre. </p> <p>Just five years ago every professional and family blemish of the Culkins was heaped on to the ravenous tabloid pyre as their custody and financial battles crowded the courts. Culkin's parent manager, Kit, was, \"a father from hell\"; the Home Alone prodigy, we were led to understand, was a little Lord of the Flies himself, raining down cigarette butts from his very own 11th floor Manhattan apartment. </p> <p>By contrast, the first thing that strikes you about this willowy and rather fragile young man, now aged 20, are the pronounced good manners (\"May I smoke?\") reminiscent of that other delicate child star, Freddie Bartholomew. Culkin is clearly no Little Lord Fauntleroy, though. Nor, refreshingly, is there anything of the self-consciously brash Dead End Kid about him (brought up in the Upper East Side of New York, he could have qualified). There is a suggestion of determination in his air of manly relaxation. Here is a young man who was hit at a very early age with two of the scourges of life which pass for good fortune - fame and money in stupefying abundance - and has worked out his own way of taming them. </p> <p>Culkin talks knowingly about the destructive effect of a fever for money. \"I remember one time near the end of school year, I was walking down the road with my mother saying what I wanted to do this summer and suddenly I knew there was something she did not want to tell me. She said: 'Don't make plans this summer. You might be working.' Then you find out they had already signed the contract.\" </p> <p>Culkin's father first teamed up with his common law wife, Patricia Brentrup, in North Dakota, and they lived a hippy life before settling in New York. The children - five boys and two girls - did not discover that their parents weren't married until the custody case. Kit had appeared in bit parts on Broadway with Olivier and Burton, but made no headway. He appears to have had acting plans for all the family. Kit was briefly a taxi driver, and while Macaulay was growing up he was a sacristan at their local church, St Joseph's of Yorkville, on the Upper East Side. \"It has always given me a kind of tainted view of religion,\" says Culkin. \"He used to serve mass every day and I'd see him in the back opening up the box [the tabernacle ] and taking out the crackers [the hosts]. He was the puppeteer, kind of thing.\" In later years the description was to fit even better. </p> <p>The children were raised in various New York tenements until they struck movie gold. At the height of their success they took over two floors of a fashionable Upper West Side block. By all accounts domestic life was always chaotic. But within four years of Culkin's first success the couple's relationship was on the rocks. </p> <p>Culkin's extraordinary story is in many ways the product of a deregulated Hollywood. A Mickey Rooney might have become a world star overnight, but the contract system ensured that a star could have global fame but still earn no more than a bank manager for years. Within a year - from the $100,000 brought in by Home Alone (1990) to the $8m (plus 5% of the gross - already $375m by this year) they got from Home Alone 2 (1992) - the Culkins had been given both fame and staggering wealth, the latter alone disorientating enough for most people. </p> <p>The notion that you can actually take your life in hand and alter it occurs to very few, celebrity or nonentity; the teenager who has the maturity to realise that he has all he will ever need materially, and deliberately dumps both fame and money, is a thoroughly unobserved species. And there are plenty who would put Culkin's virtual disappearance from our screens down more to the fading appeal of an ageing child star than any choice on his part. </p> <p>Certainly, the low returns for The Pagemaster, Getting Even With Dad and Richie Rich knocked him off the list of bankable stars. But Culkin's own account of grabbing control of his life, of choosing to get off the Hollywood conveyor belt on to which his father had so effectively delivered him, is convincing. \"What happened was that my father just was not around one day. He just upped and left without explaining himself to anyone.\" Fourteen years old, Culkin saw his opportunity. </p> <p>\"When I finally got the chance to say, 'I don't want to do this any more,' I said to my family and my representatives: 'I'm stopping. Call it what you want - call it retirement, say whatever you want, because it has nothing to do with me any more. I am not a press statement.' So I went to college - and found romance.\" He makes a rueful face at this reference to his very brief marriage. In June 1998 he married 17-year-old actress Rachel Miner. They separated this August. </p> <p>Culkin might still be trapped in the business but for a fatal mistake by his father: it never occurred to Kit to involve the child in what they were doing. \"I've done 14 films and never looked at one script. I was just a machine. My father would go over what I was doing next day, I'd go on the set, do it, come home, go over what we were going to do the next morning. I had really no sense of the actual film. After a while I did not care any more. I had been wanting to stop since I was about 11.\" </p> <p> He expresses little rancour towards his father. \"I was just not willing to let him control my life on many levels. People who know him say: 'He was a great manager but I'd hate him as a father.' I haven't seen or heard from him for a bunch of years, about three and a half. Actually, I think he needs that time more than I do. Hopefully at some point he will realise some of the things he has done. But I understand my parents put me in the financial position I am in today and I am grateful for that.\" </p> <p>At the height of his career Culkin travelled with his father most of the time, and became increasingly anguished at being away from his brothers and sisters so much. This need for family life surfaced in a remark he made while telling how he was already financially independent for life: \"I found myself in a position where I could lock myself in a room and watch television for the rest of my life.\" Then, rather touchingly, he added: \"Even then my kids would still be able to go to college.\" </p> <p>They were a very close family, physically at least. \"We lived in an apartment that was basically a hallway, set with doorways but with no doors. Five of us slept in two bunk beds. It was very odd; we still lived in the same tenement for two years after we had money. We were so used to living in a one-room apartment that when we moved into a big place we were still living like we were in a small place. We were not used to having our clothes in the laundry every day. Those new things took some getting used to.\" He has recently bought an apartment for himself. </p> <p>Culkin talks with maturity about his singular brush with high-wattage fame. \"When I was young I had to turn off because I couldn't let anyone hurt me any more. It was probably when I was nine and everything was happen ing. One day you are an average kid walking down the street and the next this kid is peering in your window trying to get a glimpse of you.

      "bodyText": "A scene of dreamy serenity is not one you readily associate with Macaulay Culkin, the biggest child star since Shirley Temple, whose career disintegrated six years ago. But there he was below us on the stage of the Vaudeville with his co-star Ir\u00e8ne Jacob (the star of Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colours: Red), patiently playing a little low-key verbal ping pong while the technical crew worked out the lighting. If ever there was a context for petulance or tantrums, this was it. During a technical run-through the actors are nothing but objects to be lit, expected to do their moves and say their lines unemphatically over and over, with no one really listening. Every now and then a voice from below told them to take it from some point where the light was not quite right and they began again, in playful exchanges, savouring their lines for pitch and rhythm, getting the feel of the old British theatre. Just five years ago every professional and family blemish of the Culkins was heaped on to the ravenous tabloid pyre as their custody and financial battles crowded the courts. Culkin's parent manager, Kit, was, \"a father from hell\"; the Home Alone prodigy, we were led to understand, was a little Lord of the Flies himself, raining down cigarette butts from his very own 11th floor Manhattan apartment. By contrast, the first thing that strikes you about this willowy and rather fragile young man, now aged 20, are the pronounced good manners (\"May I smoke?\") reminiscent of that other delicate child star, Freddie Bartholomew. Culkin is clearly no Little Lord Fauntleroy, though. Nor, refreshingly, is there anything of the self-consciously brash Dead End Kid about him (brought up in the Upper East Side of New York, he could have qualified). There is a suggestion of determination in his air of manly relaxation. Here is a young man who was hit at a very early age with two of the scourges of life which pass for good fortune - fame and money in stupefying abundance - and has worked out his own way of taming them. Culkin talks knowingly about the destructive effect of a fever for money. \"I remember one time near the end of school year, I was walking down the road with my mother saying what I wanted to do this summer and suddenly I knew there was something she did not want to tell me. She said: 'Don't make plans this summer. You might be working.' Then you find out they had already signed the contract.\" Culkin's father first teamed up with his common law wife, Patricia Brentrup, in North Dakota, and they lived a hippy life before settling in New York. The children - five boys and two girls - did not discover that their parents weren't married until the custody case. Kit had appeared in bit parts on Broadway with Olivier and Burton, but made no headway. He appears to have had acting plans for all the family. Kit was briefly a taxi driver, and while Macaulay was growing up he was a sacristan at their local church, St Joseph's of Yorkville, on the Upper East Side. \"It has always given me a kind of tainted view of religion,\" says Culkin. \"He used to serve mass every day and I'd see him in the back opening up the box [the tabernacle ] and taking out the crackers [the hosts]. He was the puppeteer, kind of thing.\" In later years the description was to fit even better. The children were raised in various New York tenements until they struck movie gold. At the height of their success they took over two floors of a fashionable Upper West Side block. By all accounts domestic life was always chaotic. But within four years of Culkin's first success the couple's relationship was on the rocks. Culkin's extraordinary story is in many ways the product of a deregulated Hollywood. A Mickey Rooney might have become a world star overnight, but the contract system ensured that a star could have global fame but still earn no more than a bank manager for years. Within a year - from the $100,000 brought in by Home Alone (1990) to the $8m (plus 5% of the gross - already $375m by this year) they got from Home Alone 2 (1992) - the Culkins had been given both fame and staggering wealth, the latter alone disorientating enough for most people. The notion that you can actually take your life in hand and alter it occurs to very few, celebrity or nonentity; the teenager who has the maturity to realise that he has all he will ever need materially, and deliberately dumps both fame and money, is a thoroughly unobserved species. And there are plenty who would put Culkin's virtual disappearance from our screens down more to the fading appeal of an ageing child star than any choice on his part. Certainly, the low returns for The Pagemaster, Getting Even With Dad and Richie Rich knocked him off the list of bankable stars. But Culkin's own account of grabbing control of his life, of choosing to get off the Hollywood conveyor belt on to which his father had so effectively delivered him, is convincing. \"What happened was that my father just was not around one day. He just upped and left without explaining himself to anyone.\" Fourteen years old, Culkin saw his opportunity. \"When I finally got the chance to say, 'I don't want to do this any more,' I said to my family and my representatives: 'I'm stopping. Call it what you want - call it retirement, say whatever you want, because it has nothing to do with me any more. I am not a press statement.' So I went to college - and found romance.\" He makes a rueful face at this reference to his very brief marriage. In June 1998 he married 17-year-old actress Rachel Miner. They separated this August. Culkin might still be trapped in the business but for a fatal mistake by his father: it never occurred to Kit to involve the child in what they were doing. \"I've done 14 films and never looked at one script. I was just a machine. My father would go over what I was doing next day, I'd go on the set, do it, come home, go over what we were going to do the next morning. I had really no sense of the actual film. After a while I did not care any more. I had been wanting to stop since I was about 11.\" He expresses little rancour towards his father. \"I was just not willing to let him control my life on many levels. People who know him say: 'He was a great manager but I'd hate him as a father.' I haven't seen or heard from him for a bunch of years, about three and a half. Actually, I think he needs that time more than I do. Hopefully at some point he will realise some of the things he has done. But I understand my parents put me in the financial position I am in today and I am grateful for that.\" At the height of his career Culkin travelled with his father most of the time, and became increasingly anguished at being away from his brothers and sisters so much. This need for family life surfaced in a remark he made while telling how he was already financially independent for life: \"I found myself in a position where I could lock myself in a room and watch television for the rest of my life.\" Then, rather touchingly, he added: \"Even then my kids would still be able to go to college.\" They were a very close family, physically at least. \"We lived in an apartment that was basically a hallway, set with doorways but with no doors. Five of us slept in two bunk beds. It was very odd; we still lived in the same tenement for two years after we had money. We were so used to living in a one-room apartment that when we moved into a big place we were still living like we were in a small place. We were not used to having our clothes in the laundry every day. Those new things took some getting used to.\" He has recently bought an apartment for himself. Culkin talks with maturity about his singular brush with high-wattage fame. \"When I was young I had to turn off because I couldn't let anyone hurt me any more. It was probably when I was nine and everything was happen ing. One day you are an average kid walking down the street and the next this kid is peering in your window trying to get a glimpse of you. That was too much for me to handle. I didn't have any friends. I was one of those kids who lock themselves in a room and drown themselves in television.\" Finally, after four years' silence, he called his agent a year ago, and now he finds himself in Madame Melville, which has the well-worn theme of a boy being seduced by his French teacher. He is generously loyal to the team (Richard Nelson, the play's writer and director, and his fellow actors) behind an enterprise which leaves him very vulnerable. For former child stars their first kiss was the great career leap, but Culkin appears about to dive headlong into the Kama Sutra. Does he realise how the tabloids will treat his revealing stage debut? Imagine what they could do with, for instance, the stage direction which reads: \"She reaches inside the robe and pulls down his underpants.\" But Culkin, it seems, has been more alert to the pitfalls of stripping on stage than some other recent Hollywood imports; the underpants scene has been excised. \"We thought that was too much.
