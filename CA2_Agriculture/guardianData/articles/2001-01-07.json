      "body": "<p>Ah, the magic of the Cup. </p> <p>How else can you explain why Dagenham and Redbridge, seventh in the Conference, could come within minutes of beating Charlton, similarly placed in the Premiership and conquerors of Arsenal just five days earlier? </p> <p>Not only were the part-timers from Essex on the brink of writing another chapter in the long and illustrious history of FA Cup giant-killing, but they justifiably felt hard done by not to have beaten Charlton. </p> <p>Barely five minutes of normal time remained when John Salako, who played in the 1990 final for Crystal Palace, scored a spectacular goal to salvage a draw for Charlton and spare their blushes. Up to that point it looked as though Junior McDougald, Texas-born and Tottenham-taught, was going to follow the likes of Ronnie Radford et al by scoring a goal to give David a mighty victory over Goliath. </p> <p>McDougald has been round the houses since leaving Spurs as a teenager - Brighton, Chesterfield, Rotherham, Millwall, Chesterfield, Orient and even a spell with Toulon in France - but when he headed home Mark Janney's cross to put Dagenham ahead three minutes before half-time, he was set to become a household name. </p> <p>Good work from his strike partner Danny Shipp, who held off the challenge of Richard Rufus, set up Janney to cross from the right, and the ball sailed over goalkeeper Dean Kiely for McDougald to thump home a header from close range. Few would deny Dagenham their lead. They took the game to Charlton from the start, and what they lacked in that extra yard of pace, they more than made up for in determination and effort. </p> <p>'That is what the cup is all about,' admitted Alan Curbishley, the Charlton manager. 'Dagenham were the better team in the way they went about it, and we were minutes away from getting scalped. It's a fantastic achievement and they thoroughly deserved it.' </p> <p>Garry Hill, his opposite number, said: 'I'm a very proud manager tonight, especially when you consider Charlton beat Arsenal here and scored three against Manchester United. </p> <p>'You come to a Premiership club frightened you are going to get a trouncing, but within ten minutes we felt confident. I couldn't see Charlton scoring.' </p> <p>Quite.

      "bodyText": "Ah, the magic of the Cup. How else can you explain why Dagenham and Redbridge, seventh in the Conference, could come within minutes of beating Charlton, similarly placed in the Premiership and conquerors of Arsenal just five days earlier? Not only were the part-timers from Essex on the brink of writing another chapter in the long and illustrious history of FA Cup giant-killing, but they justifiably felt hard done by not to have beaten Charlton. Barely five minutes of normal time remained when John Salako, who played in the 1990 final for Crystal Palace, scored a spectacular goal to salvage a draw for Charlton and spare their blushes. Up to that point it looked as though Junior McDougald, Texas-born and Tottenham-taught, was going to follow the likes of Ronnie Radford et al by scoring a goal to give David a mighty victory over Goliath. McDougald has been round the houses since leaving Spurs as a teenager - Brighton, Chesterfield, Rotherham, Millwall, Chesterfield, Orient and even a spell with Toulon in France - but when he headed home Mark Janney's cross to put Dagenham ahead three minutes before half-time, he was set to become a household name. Good work from his strike partner Danny Shipp, who held off the challenge of Richard Rufus, set up Janney to cross from the right, and the ball sailed over goalkeeper Dean Kiely for McDougald to thump home a header from close range. Few would deny Dagenham their lead. They took the game to Charlton from the start, and what they lacked in that extra yard of pace, they more than made up for in determination and effort. 'That is what the cup is all about,' admitted Alan Curbishley, the Charlton manager. 'Dagenham were the better team in the way they went about it, and we were minutes away from getting scalped. It's a fantastic achievement and they thoroughly deserved it.' Garry Hill, his opposite number, said: 'I'm a very proud manager tonight, especially when you consider Charlton beat Arsenal here and scored three against Manchester United. 'You come to a Premiership club frightened you are going to get a trouncing, but within ten minutes we felt confident. I couldn't see Charlton scoring.' Quite. Martin Pringle, replacing the injured Jonatan Johansson in attack, missed two good chances to give Charlton the lead, but Dagenham always looked more likely to open the scoring. Steve Heffer and Lee Goodwin both missed with close-range headers before McDougald scored to set the large and noisy visiting contingent into raptures. Charlton almost equalised two minutes into the second-half when Pringle headed against the inside of the far post, but that was a rare foray past an otherwise solid Dagenham defence. Indeed, the visitors should have increased their lead before Charlton equalised. At one stage they had a three-to-one numerical advantage on the break, and then substitute Rob Haworth hammered a volley high over the bar when he had the goal at his mercy. At the other end, former QPR goalkeeper Tony Roberts did not have too much to do apart from deal with the varying accuracy of Charlton's long-range shooting. Substitute Salako finally equalised, his swerving left-footed volley from 30 yards taking a deflection that wrong-footed Roberts. That was in the 85th minute, and Dagenham had to face a furious finale that went into six minutes of stoppage time. But they hung on for the draw that means a replay at either Victoria Road or possibly West Ham's Upton Park on Wednesday week. Hill, meanwhile, may or may not turn out for Woodham Town, his Sunday league side, this morning depending on the size of his hangover. 'I've been milking the situation for the last few days but it will be lager tonight,' he said with a laugh. 'I'll have to see how the manager feels before seeing if I play.'",

But Yeovil, who will surely end this season as a League side themselves, thoroughly deserved the standing ovation they received from both sets of supporters on the final whistle. </p> <p>Sam Allardyce's calculated gamble of fielding a shadow team was always likely to be severely questioned by a Yeovil side currently heading the Conference with Manchester United-like domination. So it proved as the first division side, FA Cup semi-finalists last season, fell behind to a controversial opening goal from the visitors after 24 minutes. </p> <p>Warren Patmore, an extrovert character who once retired from non-League football to try and become a professional golfer, was the scorer, collecting a Ben Smith through ball in a borderline offside position. </p> <p>The pass looped over defender Mike Whitlow and presented Patmore with the chance to finish confidently from 15 yards, a goal that infuriated the home team although replays suggested Patmore may have been marginally on. </p> <p>Despite continued confident play from the visitors, a first half equaliser never seemed far away. Italian youngster Emanuelle Morini forced Tony Pennock into a fine one-handed save with a curling left-foot shot from 20 yards and, two minutes before the interval midfielder John O'Kane levelled with an untidy goal. </p> <p>Bolton opened the second half with increased urgency and an obvious sense of relief. O'Kane came close to his, and Bolton's, second as he rose at the far post to meet a Simon Charlton left-wing cross with a header that flew just wide. </p> <p>By that stage Bolton had lost Holdsworth, leaving the home side down to 10 men for the game's concluding 23 minutes. The disadvantage did not prevent Bolton's continued domination. Frandsen's superb 20-yard free-kick again found Pennock inspired, this time the keeper producing a diving one-handed save.</p>",

Kevin Nolan chested a long free-kick into his path and, after a kind bounce, Ricketts lashed in an unstoppable right-foot shot. But Yeovil, who will surely end this season as a League side themselves, thoroughly deserved the standing ovation they received from both sets of supporters on the final whistle. Sam Allardyce's calculated gamble of fielding a shadow team was always likely to be severely questioned by a Yeovil side currently heading the Conference with Manchester United-like domination. So it proved as the first division side, FA Cup semi-finalists last season, fell behind to a controversial opening goal from the visitors after 24 minutes. Warren Patmore, an extrovert character who once retired from non-League football to try and become a professional golfer, was the scorer, collecting a Ben Smith through ball in a borderline offside position. The pass looped over defender Mike Whitlow and presented Patmore with the chance to finish confidently from 15 yards, a goal that infuriated the home team although replays suggested Patmore may have been marginally on. Despite continued confident play from the visitors, a first half equaliser never seemed far away. Italian youngster Emanuelle Morini forced Tony Pennock into a fine one-handed save with a curling left-foot shot from 20 yards and, two minutes before the interval midfielder John O'Kane levelled with an untidy goal. Bolton opened the second half with increased urgency and an obvious sense of relief. O'Kane came close to his, and Bolton's, second as he rose at the far post to meet a Simon Charlton left-wing cross with a header that flew just wide. By that stage Bolton had lost Holdsworth, leaving the home side down to 10 men for the game's concluding 23 minutes. The disadvantage did not prevent Bolton's continued domination. Frandsen's superb 20-yard free-kick again found Pennock inspired, this time the keeper producing a diving one-handed save.",

Listening to Richard Littlejohn and his gloomy mates on the radio every Saturday evening one could easily conclude Spurs are the dullest team in the Premiership and that visits to White Hart Lane are about as uplifting as the Christmas omnibus edition of EastEnders. Yet George Graham's team have won eight of 11 home matches this season and drawn the other three. </p> <p>Arsenal and Manchester United have won nine at home and Spurs, unlike United, have yet to be beaten in front of their own crowd. Even allowing for the fact that Graham's sides will never win awards for cavalier football, this is not the sort of form that usually has supporters commiserating with each other and questioning the aptitude of their manager. But then again, look where Spurs' impressive home form has got them. They start the new year as the lowest-placed London club in the Premiership. </p> <p>The reason is not difficult to spot. Spurs have a big fat zero in their away wins column, and a meagre two points to show from 11 games on their travels this season. This is a pathetic return by any standards, and the worst away record in the Premiership, though Spurs are not alone in setting wildly different standards at home and away. Chelsea, the season's next worst travellers, have won eight at home and none away. The expected challengers to Manchester United have all fallen away because... they have fallen away. </p> <p>Arsenal and Liverpool both boast the same nine from 11 home wins as United, but whereas the defending champions have managed six away wins, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and G\u00e9rard Houllier are both fretting about a string of away defeats. </p> <p>United's away tally is healthily in the black, with 20 for to 10 against, Ipswich's is level, and everyone else is in the red. Leeds United, those other expected Champions League contenders, have scored just seven times to Ipswich's 16 in losing four away games. Although the Champions League has undoubtedly been a distraction, Leeds simply appear to be having an old-fashioned bad run on the domestic front. But what has been going on everywhere else? Why has the division between home and away suddenly become so pronounced? Why is the malaise affecting the bigger, more ambitious clubs, and not the smaller ones?</p> <p>Graham says he is baffled by Spurs' away form: 'It's the puzzle of the season and I can't quite put my finger on where we are going wrong.' Hmm. Spurs' defeat at Manchester United last month was not too much of a puzzle. Graham's players appeared to have worked out in advance they were not going to take anything from the game and decided to get it over as quickly as possible. At Old Trafford that is perhaps understandable. What baffles Spurs fans is why the team take the same attitude to places like Southampton and Ipswich. </p> <p>Darren Anderton is refreshingly honest on the subject: 'We haven't played well away from home this season; we've been awful really.' Steffen Freund pointed out that the United game was all too typical: 'Away from home we stay too deep and don't get forward enough to create pressure.' Yes but why? The more critical of Spurs fans blame Graham, for being old-school enough to try to stifle games and play for a point away from home. If so, the strategy is not working. For all the away points they have picked up this season Spurs might as well have started every game with three strikers and a devil-may-care attitude. </p> <p>On the whole, however, Chelsea are not a great argument for such a policy. Like Graham, Claudio Ranieri is at a loss to explain dismal away results, but he professes not to be too worried about them. 'I can't criticise my players. We have been playing well but not getting much luck,' he said. 'We should have won at Middlesbrough, when we had several chances to score but lost to a deflection. We were two-nil up at Ipswich and missed two more excellent chances to kill the game before Ipswich came back. Obviously I wish we had taken those chances, but you don't get everything you wish for. I have to be happy that we are playing well enough to create chances. The time to worry is when you are not.' </p> <p>Between the opposite extremes of carefree Chelsea and cautious Spurs, Arsenal and Liverpool have more prosaic explanations. Wenger has admitted his side need to be 'more audacious' away from home, but there is another problem specific to Arsenal. The Gunners used to have a defence that built a platform for results away from home, and at the moment they don't. For the first time in years, Arsenal are having to chase games. 'It is a problem I've never had before,' Wenger said. 'I've hardly ever had to put out a side lacking David Seaman, Tony Adams and Martin Keown.' </p> <p>And Liverpool? Well, apart from not being as ruthlessly professional in shutting out opponents and holding on to an advantage as their predecessors from Anfield's glory years, Liverpool might just have been unlucky. They were winning 2-0 at Elland Road in November, hardly a sign of a hesitant away side, when a mistake by Christian Ziege triggered a barely credible 4-3 defeat. Neutral observers reckon the defeat at Middlesbrough two weeks ago was one of the most one-sided games in Premiership history, with Boro pinching a result that Houllier was at a loss to explain, following as it did the first away win at Old Trafford for two years. </p> <p>'Our away form is quite good,' Houllier said, 'but our results need to improve.' Perhaps it is true, as Chelsea's Ranieri says, that this sort of thing is quite normal in football. Perhaps what needs explaining is the abnormality of Manchester United, who chase games better than anyone else in the country when they have to, but mostly don't have to. Travelling United fans regularly goad rival supporters with chants about providing their 'Cup final', but it is possible that is not happening any longer. Smaller clubs do not seem to be raising their game for United as they once did, but opting for damage limitation instead. Meanwhile it is Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Spurs who are playing cup finals every other week.</p>",

The more critical of Spurs fans blame Graham, for being old-school enough to try to stifle games and play for a point away from home. If so, the strategy is not working. For all the away points they have picked up this season Spurs might as well have started every game with three strikers and a devil-may-care attitude. On the whole, however, Chelsea are not a great argument for such a policy. Like Graham, Claudio Ranieri is at a loss to explain dismal away results, but he professes not to be too worried about them. 'I can't criticise my players. We have been playing well but not getting much luck,' he said. 'We should have won at Middlesbrough, when we had several chances to score but lost to a deflection. We were two-nil up at Ipswich and missed two more excellent chances to kill the game before Ipswich came back. Obviously I wish we had taken those chances, but you don't get everything you wish for. I have to be happy that we are playing well enough to create chances. The time to worry is when you are not.' Between the opposite extremes of carefree Chelsea and cautious Spurs, Arsenal and Liverpool have more prosaic explanations. Wenger has admitted his side need to be 'more audacious' away from home, but there is another problem specific to Arsenal. The Gunners used to have a defence that built a platform for results away from home, and at the moment they don't. For the first time in years, Arsenal are having to chase games. 'It is a problem I've never had before,' Wenger said. 'I've hardly ever had to put out a side lacking David Seaman, Tony Adams and Martin Keown.' And Liverpool? Well, apart from not being as ruthlessly professional in shutting out opponents and holding on to an advantage as their predecessors from Anfield's glory years, Liverpool might just have been unlucky. They were winning 2-0 at Elland Road in November, hardly a sign of a hesitant away side, when a mistake by Christian Ziege triggered a barely credible 4-3 defeat. Neutral observers reckon the defeat at Middlesbrough two weeks ago was one of the most one-sided games in Premiership history, with Boro pinching a result that Houllier was at a loss to explain, following as it did the first away win at Old Trafford for two years. 'Our away form is quite good,' Houllier said, 'but our results need to improve.' Perhaps it is true, as Chelsea's Ranieri says, that this sort of thing is quite normal in football. Perhaps what needs explaining is the abnormality of Manchester United, who chase games better than anyone else in the country when they have to, but mostly don't have to. Travelling United fans regularly goad rival supporters with chants about providing their 'Cup final', but it is possible that is not happening any longer. Smaller clubs do not seem to be raising their game for United as they once did, but opting for damage limitation instead. Meanwhile it is Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Spurs who are playing cup finals every other week.",

      "body": "<p>Even the most sophisticated of people receive naff Christmas presents, it seems. As Christian Damiano sits at the Fulham training ground in unaccustomed suit and tie, trying patiently to explain in his developing English how the club's French renaissance has been shaped, your eye is drawn to his socks. They have the club crest on them. </p> <p>Christian who? The same was asked of Gross at Tottenham, who came, saw and confounded. This one, though, sounds as if he knows what he is doing. If Jean Tigana is the architect of Fulham's Premiership plan, Damiano is the draughtsman - one of those unsung, brilliant, career coaches, who abound in French football and one who contributed significantly to their becoming world champions. </p> <p>Today offers the ultimate test for Tigana and Damiano to see how their construction is taking shape, with the visit of Manchester United to Craven Cottage for an FA Cup third-round tie to relish - a meeting of runaway leaders of Premiership and First Division. Damiano smiles a toothy grin at the prospect.'They are an example, the best team perhaps in the world,' he says. 'It is modern football. They can score from every player. They have big movement. They take risks. They have great passion.' </p> <p>Can Fulham play this football? 'We need to play 140 per cent,' he says, with that French footballing fondness for expressing everything in percentages (Ars\u00e8ne Wenger often talks of players being at 80 per cent of their capacity, the team at 90 per cent of their efficiency). 'We are progressing but we don't play every game at the same level as them.' </p> <p>Even if you take that as a no, the fascination of watching them try should be, ooh, 150 per cent. Damiano accepts that the absence of the captain, Chris Coleman, who broke his right leg in a car accident last week, is a huge blow but believes that any replacement should be familiar with the all-important system - 'and then it comes to the quality of the player'. </p> <p>As Fulham slipped out of contention for the First Division play-offs last season, the then manager, Paul Bracewell, gradually realised, apparently, that the club's colourful owner Mohamed al-Fayed was looking for a 'name' to replace him. Indeed, Fayed phoned Eric Cantona, but he was too busy with beach soccer and other acting roles and recommended Tigana. </p> <p>But Tigana is proving that he is more than a name. Shrewdly, he spent the last weeks of last season observing and analysing the club and their needs. Then he placed a call to Nice, to Christian Damiano, to offer him the job as his assistant. The man from near Monte Carlo said yes and the revolution began. </p> <p>'He has brought a good team of coaches around him,' said Wenger last week as his first response to a question about Tigana's success. G\u00e9rard Houllier believes Damiano to be a top man. 'I like him. He's very important to them,' says the Crystal Palace boss Alan Smith, formerly Fulham's academy director. 'But I also have the utmost respect for Tigana. The vision, the system is his. I also like his lack of ego.' </p> <p>Damiano knew Tigana as a player from the great French team of the Eighties when the elegant midfielder was Michel Platini's lieutenant. They first met in 1993 when Tigana was a student on a coaching course at Clairefontaine run by Damiano. 'He was in my group for four years,' says Damiano. 'He arrived and he wanted to learn. Every big player understands it is different work being a coach. You learn the physical, the tactical, the psychological. You need a big knowledge for everything. Jean wanted to learn to be a big coach. Always he was very interested in everything.' Lessons there for every English player - and chairman - who believes you just have to have had a playing career. </p> <p>Tigana became manager of Monaco and remained in touch with Damiano, by now Houllier's trusted assistant with the under-18 team that included Thierry Henry and which won the European Championship in 1996, Henry being a Monaco player at the time. Damiano then joined Aime Jacquet's staff, monitoring the French national team players in Italy ahead of the '98 World Cup. 'I would spend seven or eight days observing sessions with Marcello Lippi and Arrigo Sacchi,' Damiano recalls. </p> <p>After a year as assistant to Jacquet's successor, Roger Lemerre, Damiano answered a call from struggling Nice but soon jumped at Tigana's offer. 'There was big politics in Nice,' he says. 'It was not possible to build there like here in Fulham.' </p> <p>The work began in earnest in pre-season, the third musketeer, fitness coach Roger Propos, coming into his own. Fulham went to Clairefontaine, where the players were introduced to a regime of three sessions a day, at 7am, 10am and 2.30pm. 'A few of the old pros found it a bit of a shock,' says the defender Andy Melville, 'They were used to half past 10. But we got on with it and enjoyed it in the end. It makes sense.' </p> <p>Methods de rigueur in France but still unusual in England, such as dental check-ups, to gauge posture and balance, were introduced. Body fat is measured every month. 'Paul Bracewell also talked to us about diet and nutrition and our fat was down to 13, 12, 11 per cent,' says Melville. 'This year it's 10, nine and eight.' Tigana has also imposed an alcohol ban. </p> <p>'The players understand why the food you eat is important for the effect on the blood,' says Damiano. 'They have it explained to them very well. The fantastic attitude has been the passion of the players for the work. They are always ready, always interested. It is easy to build on this.' </p> <p>Indeed, it must seem simple at times to Tigana and Damiano. They have honed with their methods an already competent group of home-grown players, not yet adding significantly, even if the purchase of the Henryesque - though left-footed - striker Louis Saha from Metz for \u00a32.5 million has gilded the lily. The training regime is based on 'many, many repetitions', according to Damiano, likening it to a golfer grooving his swing. 'If you learn very well the basic skills, it is possible to add things,' he says. 'It is easy to train players. When things are automatic, it is not then a problem to take a risk.' </p> <p>'He is very quiet, very efficient, pays great attention to detail,' says Alan Smith. 'They practise one thing at a time until they have mastered it.' </p> <p>Tedious? 'No, it's fun,' says the striker Barry Hayles. 'It changes day in, day out. There's a lot of ball work, one- and two-touch. Tigana is always cracking jokes and Christian has new ideas and techniques. Like, we will have a heading day. You think \"boring\", but the way he does it, it is competitive and enjoyable, with new games where you head the ball throughout.' </p> <p>It has combined to produce an enlightened brand of build-from-the-back passing football, with players such as the right-back Steve Finnan and Sean Davis in midfield emerging as more rounded performers.All are encouraged to be adventurous most likely to be seen today in the gifted little left-winger on loan from Rennes, Fabrice Fernandes. 'You accept mistakes as long as players work hard to get the ball back,' says Damiano. 'If you want players to take risks and have success, you must do this.' </p> <p>An hour-and-a-half before kick-off on match days, Tigana will show them video clips of the opposition - though he might be tempted to forego that today so as not to frighten them - giving pointers about how to counter them. Then he will deliver his main team talk. 'All he says really is go out there and play,' says Hayles. It mirrors Wenger at Arsenal; the real work long complete. 'The time for reflection is not when you step on the pitch,' Tigana himself has said. 'It comes weeks before.' </p> <p>Not that Tigana is some serene purist. 'He can lose it,' says Melville, once subjected to Peter Reid at Sunderland. 'He'll let you know if he's not happy. He raises his voice. But he'll also think about what he's going to tell the players as well. Sometimes in this game, things can be said at half-time that are out of order.' </p> <p>'At Sheffield Wednesday, he came in at half-time very irate,' Hayles recalls. 'It was the first time I saw him say a lot at half-time. He dragged the paper off the wall, got his pen out and started scribbling things. A lot of managers would bawl you out, but he tends to show you how things are going wrong and how to change it. He pulls people out and has a word with them individually. He's done it with me and I appreciate that. It's helped my confidence.' </p> <p>Tigana, like Wenger and Houllier, also accepts that this is a contact sport. Against Portsmouth, Fulham were in danger of being bullied. Tigana stressed the need for physical competition in the second half. 'Everyone says we can't handle that,' says Melville. 'But I think we thrive on it, if anything. He says, \"Keep your discipline but don't pull out of the tackles. Show them what you are about.\"' </p> <p>Tigana is bucking the current trend, that the greatest of players do not make the best coaches. 'I've often had this discussion with Michel Platini,' Tigana has said. 'He thought things were very simple and he couldn't understand why someone couldn't do this or that. </p> <p>'I looked at things the other way round. I have spent entire nights thinking about those things I did naturally, about how I could find training which would allow my players to do those things. If you have a team or players who don't understand, you have to find training exercises which will make them understand. I love communicating and passing on knowledge.' </p> <p>'He has personality,' says Wenger. 'He has pushed through his vision of football and sticks to it. He already had a good team and now he has added Saha. This and his coaches, explains his success.' It adds up to a microcosm of the English game. Tigana's predecessor Kevin Keegan was a talkative motivator for both club and country; overseas expertise is adding to the passion for the game. </p> <p>'You have spirit, you have fantastic spectators, you have TV, you have money. The game here is a church,' says Damiano. 'Now you need to play the international game.' And you notice that those Fulham socks of his are pulled up.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Even the most sophisticated of people receive naff Christmas presents, it seems. As Christian Damiano sits at the Fulham training ground in unaccustomed suit and tie, trying patiently to explain in his developing English how the club's French renaissance has been shaped, your eye is drawn to his socks. They have the club crest on them. Christian who? The same was asked of Gross at Tottenham, who came, saw and confounded. This one, though, sounds as if he knows what he is doing. If Jean Tigana is the architect of Fulham's Premiership plan, Damiano is the draughtsman - one of those unsung, brilliant, career coaches, who abound in French football and one who contributed significantly to their becoming world champions. Today offers the ultimate test for Tigana and Damiano to see how their construction is taking shape, with the visit of Manchester United to Craven Cottage for an FA Cup third-round tie to relish - a meeting of runaway leaders of Premiership and First Division. Damiano smiles a toothy grin at the prospect.'They are an example, the best team perhaps in the world,' he says. 'It is modern football. They can score from every player. They have big movement. They take risks. They have great passion.' Can Fulham play this football? 'We need to play 140 per cent,' he says, with that French footballing fondness for expressing everything in percentages (Ars\u00e8ne Wenger often talks of players being at 80 per cent of their capacity, the team at 90 per cent of their efficiency). 'We are progressing but we don't play every game at the same level as them.' Even if you take that as a no, the fascination of watching them try should be, ooh, 150 per cent. Damiano accepts that the absence of the captain, Chris Coleman, who broke his right leg in a car accident last week, is a huge blow but believes that any replacement should be familiar with the all-important system - 'and then it comes to the quality of the player'. As Fulham slipped out of contention for the First Division play-offs last season, the then manager, Paul Bracewell, gradually realised, apparently, that the club's colourful owner Mohamed al-Fayed was looking for a 'name' to replace him. Indeed, Fayed phoned Eric Cantona, but he was too busy with beach soccer and other acting roles and recommended Tigana. But Tigana is proving that he is more than a name. Shrewdly, he spent the last weeks of last season observing and analysing the club and their needs. Then he placed a call to Nice, to Christian Damiano, to offer him the job as his assistant. The man from near Monte Carlo said yes and the revolution began. 'He has brought a good team of coaches around him,' said Wenger last week as his first response to a question about Tigana's success. G\u00e9rard Houllier believes Damiano to be a top man. 'I like him. He's very important to them,' says the Crystal Palace boss Alan Smith, formerly Fulham's academy director. 'But I also have the utmost respect for Tigana. The vision, the system is his. I also like his lack of ego.'

That dream came to an end when I hit three trees as I skidded out of control and off the road, although it was to be another year before I realised I would never play again. </p> <p>I spent six months at the RAF's rehabilitation unit at Headley Court, learning to walk again just as Douglas Bader had done a generation earlier.

Because the tie is over two legs, it is important for us not to be too gung-ho at home, and I think the first leg at Selhurst Park may be more like a European game than an old-fashioned English cup-tie. The best we can hope for is to take a one- or two-goal lead to Anfield, while I have to admit that a home defeat would make it very, very difficult for us to get to the final. </p> <p>We also have a young side - younger than our class of '95 - but potentially better, and I am working hard to do everything I can to improve the players I have and the squad.

It has nothing to do with his decades-long quest to secure a British passport and does not involve re-erecting the Royal warrants outside his Harrods store in London's Knightsbridge. </p> <p>This dream is to make Fulham Football Club one of the greatest names in world football. Today Fayed, the Fulham owner-chairman, will savour the opportunity to gauge how close his dream is to reality when his team play Manchester United in the FA Cup. Only five years ago it was Scarborough, Rochdale and Hartlepool in Division Three as Fulham threatened to slip out of the League. </p> <p>These days, Fulham are directed from Fayed's Knightsbridge HQ as much as Craven Cottage. Since he took over in 1997, he has had Kevin Keegan - initially with another former England captain, Ray Wilkins, alongside - Paul Bracewell and now Jean Tigana guiding the team up the Football League. All those managers have had Fayed's money to spend on top-quality players. They are runaway First Division leaders and promotion looks assured. </p> <p>And so to Manchester United. What better yardstick could the Egyptian millionaire have? He will not miss the chance to compare and contrast in the round's most glamorous tie. </p> <p>'Manchester United are recognised everywhere football is played as being one of the outstanding names in in the world game and that is what I want for Fulham,' says Fayed. 'That is my dream. </p> <p>'We don't want just to reach the Premier League but to establish ourselves right up with the best... Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool. When you think that we were in danger of going out of the League, we've come a long way.' </p> <p>It has been suggested - by the former Fulham coach and Observer columnist Alan Smith, for one - that the club is run as just another Harrods department and that managing the side is not much different in the Fayed scheme of things from overseeing the famous store's food hall. Fayed slaps down the suggestion - Fulham is now the real passion in his life - and, once again, he invokes his dream </p> <p>'No, that is not true. The success of Harrods is, of course, important to me. I want it to be recognised as the world's finest store, but Fulham and football is my dream. It's my passion. I know what Alan Smith said but I don't think he is right - and I don't think he knows me as well as he thinks. Having said that, he's doing a fine job for Crystal Palace.' </p> <p>Fayed has constantly been in the news for several years - for his controversial claims that the crash that killed Diana, Princess of Wales and his son Dodi was not an accident; his libel battle with disgraced MP Neil Hamilton; his quest for a passport. Yet his stewardship of Fulham, following the initial surge of interest in his plans to invest more than \u00a330 million in transforming the club, has been much less strident. Only his determination to succeed has produced the odd ripple in the club's smooth rise through the divisions. </p> <p>Paul Bracewell was one such ripple. He was signed as a player by Keegan and then eventually stepped up to manage the club when England called for Keegan in 1999. Less than a year later, in Fulham's first season back in the First Division, he was sacked. At the time, last March, Bracewell had guided Fulham to tenth place - having been in the top three during October - and had bought Premiership players such as Lee Clark, Bjarne Goldbaek and Andy Melville. </p> <p>'But I was under no illusions,' Bracewell says from the manager's office at his new employers, Halifax Town. He has no complaints about his treatment by Fayed. 'The fact that I didn't get long or that a manager such as Tigana was chosen to replace me was no shock. </p> <p>'The speculation started from day one and all sorts of people were linked with my job; Terry Venables, Glenn Hoddle and Eric Cantona, for example. </p> <p>'I remember the press conference when I was appointed and, in answer to a question, I said I thought I needed two years to get us into the Premiership. The chairman interrupted me and said I had one. That showed me what was expected. </p> <p>'Looking at Fulham now, they have not changed the personnel too much since last year and my timetable looks about right, doesn't it?' </p> <p>So is Fayed ruthless? 'Ruthless? No, but I think you do have to be single-minded if you are to be successful in any area,' he says. 'Paul Bracewell knew he was inexperienced but we gave him a try. I'm sure he will become a top manager. Kevin Keegan was let go because of the England job but he did a great job for us and I'm on very good terms with him. I regard him as a friend.' </p> <p>And so to Tigana, who grants even fewer interviews than his chairman. He lets his footballers - and their football - do the talking. There is informed gossip that Fayed sounded out Cantona for Bracewell's job only, ultimately, for Cantona to recommend that Fayed turn to Tigana. Fayed's version of events confirms this. </p> <p>He explains: 'There are several people I know in world football whose opinions I highly respect and Eric [Cantona] is one of those. He is one of several people who recommended Jean Tigana to me. All of those people have the highest regard for the vision, ability and perception of Jean Tigana and I think everyone at Craven Cottage can now see why. He has the potential to play a vital role in Fulham becoming a great club. </p> <p>'Just a few weeks ago I was talking to Michel Platini who told me he believes that Tigana could emerge as one of game's greatest managers.' </p> <p>And he insists he is not an interfering chairman - something Bracewell confirmed. 'I get in the best people and then let them do their jobs. I did not interfere in the past and I don't interfere now with Jean Tigana,' he says. </p> <p>'I am always there for Jean and he knows that - but you leave an outstanding manager to manage. We share the same vision. That much was apparent when we first sat down and discussed his coming to Fulham. We both had the vision of building Fulham into a great club.' </p> <p>Visions, dreams. Plans for a 30,000-seat stadium to supplant the terraces where Fayed claims he used to stand; a magnificent training complex in Surrey under development. Those dreams, for 90 minutes, will all be laid out vividly at Craven Cottage today. </p> <p>Only Manchester United threaten to turn them into a grimmer, wide-awake reality.</p>",

About those glory days in the Lancashire Combination, when Rossendale and their ilk were our weekly cannon-fodder, and even Burnley and Blackburn knew better than to field a team of kids and reserves when they drew us in the Senior Cup. Or the time we got ticked off over the loudspeaker for scaling the new \u00a34,000 floodlights; the Cup run of 66-67, when we took York City to a second reply at Maine Road; and the FA Trophy final win over Dartford in 1974 - a game I tragically missed because I wrote off my mum's Mini on Westgate, 600 yards down the 250-mile route to Wembley.

When he arrived seven years ago we were among the also-rans in the HFS Loans League. Today we not only have a team to ruffle Ipswich, but Jim has set up a productive youth academy. There's a fine new North Stand; a playing surface that suits the team's slick passing game; terracing in place of the old black 'slagheap' where I stood as a boy. I doubt I'll ever see the Shrimps swimming among the prawns and lobsters in the Football League. So 'll treasure days like yesterday. Where the hell is Morecambe?

'I was disturbed to read in a number of newspapers comments attributed to me suggesting that I was critical of both the England team and the manager, Kevin Keegan.

After a better-than-usual 14-1 defeat to Grenada, the team pulled off a stunning coup against the British Virgin Islands despite three key players not arriving until half-time. Taking a four-goal lead, they held out for a 4-3 win - the first in Anguilla's footballing history. Their triumph just beats Airdrie striker Paul Jack to the award: Jack issued a public apology to Livingston groundsman Andy Forrest for mistaking him for a bin and kicking him ferociously after being sent-off. Fifa also came close - in April they apologised for appointing a dead referee to officiate a World Cup qualifier.</p> <p> <strong> Best interview </strong></p> <p> RYAN GIGGS, asked by Sky Sports whether winning last season's title 'felt different' to all the others. 'It's different,' said Ryan. And how was it different? 'It's not the same.'</p> <p> <strong> Most moving moment </strong></p> <p> Saddest news of the year came from Belgian referee AMAND ANCION, who was sacked in tears after disallowing a valid goal in a First Division game between Mouscron and Charleroi. The 45-year-old told Belgian TV immediately after the game that he was 'distraught'. It was the final straw - previous career highlights included being throttled by Manchester United's Ronnie Wallwork during a game at Royal Antwerp (Wallwork was given a life ban, later overturned), and, in August 1999, issuing 12 yellow cards, four reds and five penalties in a 6-6 draw between Westerlo and Genk. He beats Norwegian goalkeeper Olav Fiske to the 'most moving moment' title. Fiske, who was seen drinking several pints of water before his side's cup-tie, couldn't hold on when the game went into extra time. With the ball upfield he rushed to the touchline to relieve himself, only to watch in horror - midstream - as opposition striker Tor Oddvar Torve lobbed the ball 40 yards into the net. The match finished 1-0.</p> <p> <strong> Best campaign </strong> </p> <p> The Crystal Palace Supporters Trust were forced to print a new batch of 'Kick (David) Mellor out of football' T-shirts after they sold out in their hundreds including, we discovered, several to his BBC Five Live colleagues. A campaign website remains, and the most admirable fight in football goes on. </p> <p><strong>Other news: the longest journey</strong></p> <p>The longest British away trip ever takes place on the 20th - Falmouth Town travel to play Bedlington Terriers in the FA Vase 4th round. That's 485.2 miles - a conservative journey time of 9 hours. 'We'll be taking 30 or 40 fans up there,' says club secretary John Thompson. 'Gone on Friday morning, back on Sunday night.' Is there any longer away trip in domestic football?

Best moment In March, the month when coach Ladislas Lozano celebrated his Calais side beating Racing Strasbourg 2-1 ('This is the most beautiful day of my life') and Cambridge United refused to say why they sacked striker Steve Guinan (an insider told us of vomit and genitals), our adopted team Anguilla won their first match ever. After a better-than-usual 14-1 defeat to Grenada, the team pulled off a stunning coup against the British Virgin Islands despite three key players not arriving until half-time. Taking a four-goal lead, they held out for a 4-3 win - the first in Anguilla's footballing history. Their triumph just beats Airdrie striker Paul Jack to the award: Jack issued a public apology to Livingston groundsman Andy Forrest for mistaking him for a bin and kicking him ferociously after being sent-off. Fifa also came close - in April they apologised for appointing a dead referee to officiate a World Cup qualifier. Best interview RYAN GIGGS, asked by Sky Sports whether winning last season's title 'felt different' to all the others. 'It's different,' said Ryan. And how was it different? 'It's not the same.' Most moving moment Saddest news of the year came from Belgian referee AMAND ANCION, who was sacked in tears after disallowing a valid goal in a First Division game between Mouscron and Charleroi. The 45-year-old told Belgian TV immediately after the game that he was 'distraught'. It was the final straw - previous career highlights included being throttled by Manchester United's Ronnie Wallwork during a game at Royal Antwerp (Wallwork was given a life ban, later overturned), and, in August 1999, issuing 12 yellow cards, four reds and five penalties in a 6-6 draw between Westerlo and Genk. He beats Norwegian goalkeeper Olav Fiske to the 'most moving moment' title. Fiske, who was seen drinking several pints of water before his side's cup-tie, couldn't hold on when the game went into extra time. With the ball upfield he rushed to the touchline to relieve himself, only to watch in horror - midstream - as opposition striker Tor Oddvar Torve lobbed the ball 40 yards into the net. The match finished 1-0. Best campaign The Crystal Palace Supporters Trust were forced to print a new batch of 'Kick (David) Mellor out of football' T-shirts after they sold out in their hundreds including, we discovered, several to his BBC Five Live colleagues. A campaign website remains, and the most admirable fight in football goes on. Other news: the longest journey The longest British away trip ever takes place on the 20th - Falmouth Town travel to play Bedlington Terriers in the FA Vase 4th round. That's 485.2 miles - a conservative journey time of 9 hours. 'We'll be taking 30 or 40 fans up there,' says club secretary John Thompson. 'Gone on Friday morning, back on Sunday night.' Is there any longer away trip in domestic football? Let us know. Rough Guide: the winners The Sturm Graz stadium is named after Arnold Schwarzenegger, not Brigitte Bardot or Macaulay Culkin.

The crowd that had gathered on the viewing terrace of the Peak to watch the martial arts film star being interviewed for a local TV show gasped and clapped their approval. As entrances go, it was a pretty good one. </p> <p>The Peak is the number one tourist attraction in Hong Kong. Take the tram to the top of this impossibly steep hill and fight your way through the crowds in the shopping mall, past the Ripley's Believe it or Not! odditorium and the new Madame Tussaud's, to the viewing deck. </p> <p>You probably won't see Jackie Chan but you will get to gaze god-like down on Hong Kong Island, the frantic activity of the harbour and the distant skyscrapers of Kowloon. The tranquil gardens of the Peak Caf\u00e9 are the perfect spot for a coffee or ice-cream in the shade of a bamboo tree.</p> <p><strong>Shopping</strong></p> <p>Hong Kong is not the bargain basement it used to be for electronic goods and garments but few places can offer such a variety of shopping experiences. Try swish shopping malls such as the Landmark and Pacific Place for designer goods (the real thing, with real prices to match), Hollywood Road for antiques and giant malls such as Harbour City for everything else. </p> <p>The huge night market on Temple Street with its dodgy designer rip-offs and bootleg CDs, palm readers and sidestalls selling murky bowls of turtle soup has a certain tacky charm while the flea market on Cat Street has a hotchpotch of stalls selling kitsch communist paraphernalia such as Chairman Mao side plates and lighters that play the communist anthem.</p> <p>Traditional Chinese department stores such as Chinese Arts and Crafts and CRC may look unpromising from the outside but are the best place to find reasonably priced Chinese crafts, jewellery and clothing. If time allows, pick your way past the fruit and veg stalls and buckets of writhing eels on Graham Street and stock up on ginseng and Chinese herbs from one of the many wholesalers on Bonham Strand West.</p> <p><strong>The Star Ferry</strong></p> <p>The Star Ferry is Hong Kong's answer to the San Francisco cable car or the London double decker - an institution, a mode of transport and a tourist attraction rolled into one. For less than 20 pence the distinctive green and white ferries take passengers between Hong Kong Island and the Kowloon peninsula. The seven-minute journey gives stunning views of the skyline on both sides, particularly beautiful at night when the skyscrapers are lit up. </p> <p>There are also regular and cheap ferry services connecting the largest of Hong Kong's 200-plus Outlying Islands. </p> <p>Lamma Island has some beautiful beaches and good seafood restaurants while sleepy Cheung Chau offers fishing junks, rugged coastal views and a welcome respite from the frenzied activity and traffic of Hong Kong Island and Kowloon. Green and rolling Lantau Island is undeveloped, although the arrival of a large mouse and his entourage in 2005 will change all that. Land reclamation work has already begun to make way for Hong Kong Disneyland although local environment groups are making valiant, if futile, attempts to minimise the impact. For the time being, the main attractions of Lantau are its good hiking terrain and the Po Lin Monastery with its huge bronze Buddha statue. </p> <p><strong>Body, mind, soul</strong></p> <p>Though it may not seem this way to an expat or a weekend visitor, there is more to Hong Kong than making money and spending it. Even the most futuristic skyscrapers are built along feng shui lines and the small and smoky temples are full at lunchtime with office workers and students lighting incense and shaking fortune sticks before gold-plated gods and their cluttered shrines piled high with fruit and flowers. </p> <p>The Hong Kong Tourist Association can help you fix up an English-speaking tai chi class, feng shui workshop, horoscope reading or a Chinese medical checkup. Full of good health I skipped into the Happy Valley medical centre for my reflexology and pulsology session. One hour later I shuffled out with a weak heart, lungs and liver, poor circulation, malfunctioning digestive system, respiratory problems and a scribbled prescription in Chinese. Deflated, I paid a palm reader in Kansu Street two dollars to tell me that I would live to a ripe old age. He also told me that I had no luck for gambling and that I would only be happy if I married a 'little successful man'. His limited English prevented me from establishing whether the little referred to my future husband's success or his stature. </p> <p><strong>Dine in style</strong></p> <p>Hong Kong offers several culinary experiences which should not be missed and many that should. A close shave with a bowl of turtle soup in Temple Street convinced me that menus with pictures or dim sum restaurants where you point at food as it is wheeled round on a trolley were the safest options. </p> <p>The Super Star Seafood Restaurant on Nathan Road offers a quite alarming range of dim sum options at lunchtime. Deep fried chicken feet and a wobbling, luminous orange blancmange goldfish were offered - and turned down - several times before something vaguely recognisable rolled by. </p> <p>Make sure you leave room for afternoon tea - a British tradition which the five-star hotels here have turned into an art form. Try The Peninsula in Kowloon or the Mandarin Oriental on Hong Kong Island for the daintiest cucumber sandwiches and pastries. </p> <p>In the evening, catch a ferry to Lamma Island to dine at one of the many seafood restaurants where the food is so fresh it's still alive. And, at some point in the evening, take the lift to the top floor of the Peninsula Hotel.</p> <p> Philippe Starck designed the bar here: the drinks are pricey, the decor bizarre and it's full of very large, very successful expats, but the views across the harbour to the bright lights of Hong Kong Island will make the bar bill seem almost reasonable.</p> <p><strong>Fact file</strong></p> <p>A five-night stay with British Airways Holidays (0870 24 24 243) at the five-star Ritz-Carlton Hotel costs \u00a3885 per person for departures between 1 February and 31 March. The price includes return scheduled flights, transfers, accommodation and UK taxes. The supplement to travel in Club World, BA's business class cabin, is \u00a3689 one way and \u00a31,378 return, but it buys you the comfort of a seat which reclines fully to make a six-foot flat bed, now available on all BA's Hong Kong flights.</p> <p>In addition the airline has installed its new World Traveller Plus cabin - an upgraded product for long haul economy travellers - on flights to Hong Kong. The new cabin features wider seats with greater legroom (38 inch pitch compared to 31 inches for World Traveller), extra handluggage allowance and seat back entertainment. World Traveller Plus fares start from \u00a31,153.50 return including taxes. (0845 77 333 77).</p>",

Land reclamation work has already begun to make way for Hong Kong Disneyland although local environment groups are making valiant, if futile, attempts to minimise the impact. For the time being, the main attractions of Lantau are its good hiking terrain and the Po Lin Monastery with its huge bronze Buddha statue. Body, mind, soul Though it may not seem this way to an expat or a weekend visitor, there is more to Hong Kong than making money and spending it. Even the most futuristic skyscrapers are built along feng shui lines and the small and smoky temples are full at lunchtime with office workers and students lighting incense and shaking fortune sticks before gold-plated gods and their cluttered shrines piled high with fruit and flowers. The Hong Kong Tourist Association can help you fix up an English-speaking tai chi class, feng shui workshop, horoscope reading or a Chinese medical checkup. Full of good health I skipped into the Happy Valley medical centre for my reflexology and pulsology session. One hour later I shuffled out with a weak heart, lungs and liver, poor circulation, malfunctioning digestive system, respiratory problems and a scribbled prescription in Chinese. Deflated, I paid a palm reader in Kansu Street two dollars to tell me that I would live to a ripe old age. He also told me that I had no luck for gambling and that I would only be happy if I married a 'little successful man'. His limited English prevented me from establishing whether the little referred to my future husband's success or his stature. Dine in style Hong Kong offers several culinary experiences which should not be missed and many that should. A close shave with a bowl of turtle soup in Temple Street convinced me that menus with pictures or dim sum restaurants where you point at food as it is wheeled round on a trolley were the safest options. The Super Star Seafood Restaurant on Nathan Road offers a quite alarming range of dim sum options at lunchtime. Deep fried chicken feet and a wobbling, luminous orange blancmange goldfish were offered - and turned down - several times before something vaguely recognisable rolled by. Make sure you leave room for afternoon tea - a British tradition which the five-star hotels here have turned into an art form. Try The Peninsula in Kowloon or the Mandarin Oriental on Hong Kong Island for the daintiest cucumber sandwiches and pastries. In the evening, catch a ferry to Lamma Island to dine at one of the many seafood restaurants where the food is so fresh it's still alive. And, at some point in the evening, take the lift to the top floor of the Peninsula Hotel. Philippe Starck designed the bar here: the drinks are pricey, the decor bizarre and it's full of very large, very successful expats, but the views across the harbour to the bright lights of Hong Kong Island will make the bar bill seem almost reasonable. Fact file A five-night stay with British Airways Holidays (0870 24 24 243) at the five-star Ritz-Carlton Hotel costs \u00a3885 per person for departures between 1 February and 31 March. The price includes return scheduled flights, transfers, accommodation and UK taxes. The supplement to travel in Club World, BA's business class cabin, is \u00a3689 one way and \u00a31,378 return, but it buys you the comfort of a seat which reclines fully to make a six-foot flat bed, now available on all BA's Hong Kong flights. In addition the airline has installed its new World Traveller Plus cabin - an upgraded product for long haul economy travellers - on flights to Hong Kong. The new cabin features wider seats with greater legroom (38 inch pitch compared to 31 inches for World Traveller), extra handluggage allowance and seat back entertainment. World Traveller Plus fares start from \u00a31,153.50 return including taxes. (0845 77 333 77).",

      "body": "<p>'Va', va'!' Valissi Corinto shouts. It is unclear whether the order is addressed to his dogs or to us as we splash through a bath of mud recently vacated by wild boars. Presumably us: the dogs are in little need of encouragement. We, on the other hand, lag behind, grumbling as we become snared in branches and slip down banks of earth.</p> <p>Valissi is a tartufaio, and for the past 37 years he and his dogs have been snuffling through the forests of the Apennine mountains of the Emilia-Romagna, in north-east Italy, searching for the much-prized subterranean golf balls of fungus known as truffles. It is a mysterious art and one he spent 30 years learning before taking up the job full-time. Our group had hoped to gain a little insight into his work, but he has the mischievous gleam in his eye of a man who knows a secret or two and isn't telling.</p> <p>Not that he has put his faith solely in nature - a few years back, he planted his own saplings of chestnut and oak impregnated with truffle spores. In another decade, they should produce a regular crop of truffles, and one he'll be able to harvest with ease. But the location is a secret. As is the way he trains his dogs - his seven-year-old bitch Juve (short, of course, for Juventus) and her two offspring Cip and Ciop (pronounced 'chip' and 'chop' and apparently the Italian names of Disney's cartoon chipmunks).</p> <p>Pigs, though better suited to this line of work (and easier for an unfit observer to keep track of), are apparently harder to train. Worse still, they are only enthusiastic about truffle hunting because they are even more enthusiastic about truffle eating. A tartufaio runs the risk of seeing his treasured fungus devoured before he can lay claim to it.</p> <p>Valissi's excitement as Juve starts to dig makes sense given the small fortune he earns for every truffle. The white variety found among tree roots here are particularly prized by gourmets for their taste and pungency. But it is a false alarm. Soon, after more fruitless searching, Valissi admits defeat. This is a bad wood for truffles, he says, and he knows a better spot nearby. Tired and messy, we're starting to cotton on. Knowledge is money, and Valissi wants to keep us as much in the dark as possible.</p> <p>In the next wood (lots of truffles but small and of poor quality, Valissi warns), Juve snouts around for a few minutes before digging frantically. Valissi pulls her back, using his vanghetto (truffling stick) to ease out the fungus ball from between the roots. Even before he has a chance to pass it to us, an offensive, slightly putrid, smell has filled the air. Maybe, I can't help feeling, it was better left buried.</p> <p>Valissi is one of a vanishing breed of woodlander. The populations of the local villages have been slowly dying out, as the old forest arts have become redundant and youngsters have been attracted to nearby cities such as Bologna and Modena. In the past few decades the village of Pianaccio has dwindled from more than 800 inhabitants to barely 30, a figure only topped up during the skiing season. The region is trying to reverse the trend by reviving some of the area's traditional industries and lifestyles. In this spirit, the mountains were declared a national park in the late Eighties. It all sounds a little worthy, but for visitors attracted here by the opportunities for walks in the mountain forests it means an unexpected bonus - the chance to be transported into the world of a Thomas Hardy novel, where foraging, scavenging and hunting are the essentials of life. It's a high-altitude slice of Wessex.</p> <p>As we walked the well-signed mountain paths, along carpets of ochre leaves and rotting chestnut cases, we regularly stumbled across crumbling casones. Once these rustic stone cottages were the key to the local economy - either as drying rooms for chestnuts, furnaces for making charcoal or as storerooms for woodland implements. There is now a drive to restore them and educate locals and visitors alike about the skills of this traditional culture.</p> <p>At the Hotel Everest in La Ca we were offered a meal of several courses, all of them made from chestnut. If it sounds a little repetitive, think again. Presumably, before the advent of supermarkets, necessity was the mother - and grandmother - of invention: we had delicious chestnut polenta, ciacci (crepe), a sweet soup and frittelle (doughy flat bread). Add a dollop of ricotta or the local stracchino cheese, and it's a tasty feast.</p> <p>Surprisingly, considering that it borders Tuscany, this region of the Apennines is little known to British visitors.

      "bodyText": "'Va', va'!' Valissi Corinto shouts. It is unclear whether the order is addressed to his dogs or to us as we splash through a bath of mud recently vacated by wild boars. Presumably us: the dogs are in little need of encouragement. We, on the other hand, lag behind, grumbling as we become snared in branches and slip down banks of earth. Valissi is a tartufaio, and for the past 37 years he and his dogs have been snuffling through the forests of the Apennine mountains of the Emilia-Romagna, in north-east Italy, searching for the much-prized subterranean golf balls of fungus known as truffles. It is a mysterious art and one he spent 30 years learning before taking up the job full-time. Our group had hoped to gain a little insight into his work, but he has the mischievous gleam in his eye of a man who knows a secret or two and isn't telling. Not that he has put his faith solely in nature - a few years back, he planted his own saplings of chestnut and oak impregnated with truffle spores. In another decade, they should produce a regular crop of truffles, and one he'll be able to harvest with ease. But the location is a secret. As is the way he trains his dogs - his seven-year-old bitch Juve (short, of course, for Juventus) and her two offspring Cip and Ciop (pronounced 'chip' and 'chop' and apparently the Italian names of Disney's cartoon chipmunks). Pigs, though better suited to this line of work (and easier for an unfit observer to keep track of), are apparently harder to train. Worse still, they are only enthusiastic about truffle hunting because they are even more enthusiastic about truffle eating. A tartufaio runs the risk of seeing his treasured fungus devoured before he can lay claim to it. Valissi's excitement as Juve starts to dig makes sense given the small fortune he earns for every truffle. The white variety found among tree roots here are particularly prized by gourmets for their taste and pungency. But it is a false alarm. Soon, after more fruitless searching, Valissi admits defeat. This is a bad wood for truffles, he says, and he knows a better spot nearby. Tired and messy, we're starting to cotton on. Knowledge is money, and Valissi wants to keep us as much in the dark as possible. In the next wood (lots of truffles but small and of poor quality, Valissi warns), Juve snouts around for a few minutes before digging frantically. Valissi pulls her back, using his vanghetto (truffling stick) to ease out the fungus ball from between the roots. Even before he has a chance to pass it to us, an offensive, slightly putrid, smell has filled the air. Maybe, I can't help feeling, it was better left buried. Valissi is one of a vanishing breed of woodlander. The populations of the local villages have been slowly dying out, as the old forest arts have become redundant and youngsters have been attracted to nearby cities such as Bologna and Modena. In the past few decades the village of Pianaccio has dwindled from more than 800 inhabitants to barely 30, a figure only topped up during the skiing season. The region is trying to reverse the trend by reviving some of the area's traditional industries and lifestyles. In this spirit, the mountains were declared a national park in the late Eighties. It all sounds a little worthy, but for visitors attracted here by the opportunities for walks in the mountain forests it means an unexpected bonus - the chance to be transported into the world of a Thomas Hardy novel, where foraging, scavenging and hunting are the essentials of life. It's a high-altitude slice of Wessex. As we walked the well-signed mountain paths, along carpets of ochre leaves and rotting chestnut cases, we regularly stumbled across crumbling casones. Once these rustic stone cottages were the key to the local economy - either as drying rooms for chestnuts, furnaces for making charcoal or as storerooms for woodland implements. There is now a drive to restore them and educate locals and visitors alike about the skills of this traditional culture. At the Hotel Everest in La Ca we were offered a meal of several courses, all of them made from chestnut. If it sounds a little repetitive, think again. Presumably, before the advent of supermarkets, necessity was the mother - and grandmother - of invention: we had delicious chestnut polenta, ciacci (crepe), a sweet soup and frittelle (doughy flat bread). Add a dollop of ricotta or the local stracchino cheese, and it's a tasty feast. Surprisingly, considering that it borders Tuscany, this region of the Apennines is little known to British visitors. In fact, it's not well-known to Italians either, unless they come for the skiing. But that's to miss out on pleasures the region has to offer at other times of the year, particularly its woodland trails. The network of paths, both high and low level, connect one village to the next, and mean it's easy to explore a new area each day. The hotel owners even lightened the load for us, in a reciprocal arrangement that ensured our bags were transported to the next destination.

      "body": "<p>A few years ago, a friend asked me which single invention separated modern man from our ancestors.</p> <p>'Penicillin,' I suggested. 'Photography?</p> <p>Sellotape?'</p> <p>'No,' he said, 'It's flight! For centuries they dreamed about it, from Icarus to Leonardo. But we can actually do it - and we should! We owe it to their memory to learn to fly!'</p> <p>It's an extreme position, but then Peter is an extreme pilot - he owns three aeroplanes. And he's always looking for potential converts. A few weeks after that conversation, he took me flying.</p> <p>It was a brilliant summer day in the Cotswolds, the flying club a broad acreage of cracked, grass-tufted concrete that once witnessed the rumbling of a hundred Lancaster bombers. As soon as we were airborne, Peter showed me how the pedals and joystick worked, and gave me the controls of the two-seater. We climbed away from the bosomy hills, levelling at 5,000 feet where we scampered among clouds of teased candyfloss. One was the shape of a doughnut, and I couldn't resist flying straight through the hole. It was a delirious sensation, and I began to laugh. I felt, I told him giggling, like an angel.</p> <p>Peter looked at me askance. 'I've had some weird reactions taking people flying, but this is the first time anyone thought they were an angel!'</p> <p>I have dreamt of flying since childhood - but who hasn't? Didn't most of us spend childhood nights flying, reliving the weightless suspension of the womb? My dreams were so vivid and familiar - they would always begin with me gliding, chest-down like Superman but mesmerically slowly, out of my room, along the landing and down the Burgundy-red stair carpet - that I was convinced of their literal reality: at night, while others slept, I flew.</p> <p>I grew up in the countryside a few miles from Farnborough, and during the annual airshow I could look up from our back lawn to see the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight pass overhead. It was rare on any summer day for five minutes to go by without the sound of an aeroplane, and we would shade our eyes and wait to capture the silver flash like a fish as it passed, straight and fast, between the chimney and the woods, and we'd try to read its shape against the sky. Now, perversely, I am reassured when the summer silence of the British countryside - the hum of bees, the distant lowing of cows - is disturbed by the faint rumble of an aero engine. This, the rumble says, is how it should be.</p> <p>A few years back I started work on a book about the world's deserts. Early one chilly desert morning on my two-year journey I was standing at the small aerodrome of Nazca, in Peru. The rising sun was staining the jagged Andes red. I climbed into a four-seat Cessna and the pilot, Carlos, fired up the engine.</p> <p>Some things only make sense from the air. Dawn is the best moment to appreciate the Nazca lines, when the shallow ridges are shadowed by the low sun, and the air is clear and vapourless. Climbing over the pampas we soon saw them: hundreds of straight lines scoring the desert, and animal shapes, including the iconic hummingbird with its wings outstretched. They seemed smaller than I expected.</p> <p>'It's because of our height,' yelled Carlos. 'They're a long way down.'</p> <p>'Well, can't we go a bit lower?'</p> <p>We dropped out of the dawn-pink sky to buzz the drawings. As we banked tightly they whirled around us - monkey, dog, 'owlman', spider.</p> <p>No one knows why, 1,500 years ago, Nazcans engraved these lines into the desert crust. Erich von Daniken's Chariots of the Gods claimed that they were landing-strips for alien spacecraft; a more plausible theory suggests they played a role in hallucinogenic rituals. Andean museum collections groan with the paraphernalia of shamanistic drug-use, and it was - is - common for shamans in these psychedelic trances to identify with some symbolic creature. Frequently they believe their spirits take to the sky, and soar. Each of the creatures on the Nazcan crust is etched in a single line. Perhaps they were paths, walked by the shamans during their possession by the animal - spiritual, not alien, runways from which the shaman's soul took flight.</p> <p>A few months after that flight, I found myself in the Peruvian Amazon, sitting in a wooden cabin with the velvet night sky overhead and the jungle raucous with insects. A shaman and I had been into the jungle and found the ayahuasca vine, and back at his village had boiled it into a thick, bilious stew. There were four of us on the oil lamp-lit porch, two of them women smoking tobacco pipes. The shaman passed the potion, and while we sipped he hummed a tune, an invocation to the spirits of ayahuasca. Soon the visions began: I was airborne, flying over endless fantastic cityscapes, their gothic towers and frothing parks delirious shades of crimson, lime-green and turquoise.</p> <p>My friend Peter was surely right that as long as man has had an imagination he has dreamt of flight. Fortifications have been constructed at the highest elevations for strategic purposes, but we are also drawn to mountaintops for reasons of the soul. Hilary's conquest of Everest had for the British, in the year of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation, some profounder meaning than a mere sporting record. Close to Everest is the fabulous Mount Meru, navel of the earth, abode of the Hindu gods. The gods of the Greeks and Romans also inhabited the heavens - as do the Trinity and angels, and all the virtuous souls, of Christianity.</p> <p>The centenary of man's first powered flight occurs in two years' time. Orville and Wilbur Wright's Flyer III was a cumbersome machine, its kite-like forward rudder and complex controls in many ways an aeronautical cul-de-sac (it was Bl\u00e9riot's Channel-crossing monoplane that standardised the aeroplane form we know today); but the Flyer changed the world for ever, possibly for the worse. In Baden-Powell's words: 'Wilbur Wright is in possession of a power which controls the fate of nations.'</p> <p>When did humans first fly? The 1965 movie Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines began with a slapstick montage of fur-clad cavemen futilely flapping their arms, and early aviators on primitive hang-gliders dropping like stones. The Chinese had constructed kites of tremendous sophistication and scale by the third century AD, and it's at least possible that people - clinging on or strapped on - took to the air. Everyone knows about the 'balloonist' craze that swept Europe in the eighteenth century in the wake of the Montgolfier brothers' hot-air ascents. But what about Sir George Cayley, MP for Scarborough, who launched a manned glider in 1848? If even a French aviation authority can call Cayley 'the true inventor of the aeroplane and one of the most powerful geniuses in the history of aviation', then it must be true - yet he languishes in obscurity.</p> <p>As for me, I continued to experience livid, full-colour flying dreams into my late teens. If they stopped, perhaps it is because, as the shrinks tell us, flying dreams are associated with sexual longing. I suspect that the improvement in my sex life grounded my dreams. But I seized every opportunity that came my way to fly small aircraft.</p> <p>I was in Kenya when I realised that the subject of my next book would be flight. A contact at Unesco's Nairobi desertification programme had introduced me to his son, a keen amateur pilot, who invited me to go flying with him over the Rift Valley. The problem was, neither of us had enough money to rent a plane. The following afternoon we went out to the airport, and hung around the pilot's clubroom until someone offered to take us up. It was a stunning flight, swooping around the emerald craters of the valley's extinct volcanoes. I discovered something valuable that day: that the owner of a pilot's licence can walk into an aerodrome, get chatting to fellow pilots, and stand a good chance of being offered a ride. Suddenly I had an image of myself 'hitch-hiking' by small plane from one aerodrome to the next - and the idea of Winging It was born, a journey around the planet celebrating the many facets of manned flight - a journey I'll be describing in The Observer over the next few months.</p> <p>So it was that on a glittering late summer afternoon four months ago I found myself at an Ontario airfield, with six weeks in which to gain a flying licence. It was my first day at the school, and I was eager to be up in the air. Who knew how long the weather would hold? Within four hours of climbing off the Airbus, I was at the controls of a Cessna 152.</p> <p>Tim Coombs, my instructor, had shown me the Walk Around: like pioneer aviators, pilots still begin every flight with a physical inspection of the plane, waggling ailerons and rudder, poking a stick in the fuel tank to check the fuel level (gauges can be unreliable), and carefully monitoring the engine's performance. To the uninitiated this behaviour implies severe doubts about the plane's airworthiness, but this is the aviator's Highway Code: when cars break down, you coast onto the hard shoulder, but aeroplanes are less forgiving, so they simply aren't allowed to go wrong. Instructors like to build your confidence fast, and they usually have you take off first time (it's landing that requires the skill). With a delicate shudder the fragile three-wheeled machine takes off, a winged Reliant Robin improbably airborne.</p> <p>Within a fortnight I was learning how to enter and recover from the spins and spiral dives we've all seen in war movies, manoeuvres which place the pilot within seconds of death. I began by dreading these nauseating exercises, but ended up taking a grim pleasure in being able to pull them off (that is, pull out of them); maybe one day I'll even start to like them. Certainly, they give you confidence in your ability to handle a plane. The British have removed these perilous techniques from the flying syllabus - making us, according to one Canadian pilot, 'a bunch of woossies'. </p> <p>Over the next six weeks I flew tiny trainers, a bulbous, leather-seated vintage Cessna (the 1954 equivalent of business jet) and a floatplane that scudded over the placid, pea-green lakes of northern Ontario. Cruising at 95 knots, I learned that unlike cars, planes can crash from being flown too slowly: the air passing over the wings is suddenly insufficient to generate lift, and the plane 'stalls'.</p> <p>This usually occurs when a pilot is so intent on giving passengers a bird's-eye-view of, say, his new swimming pool, that he takes his eye off the speedo. A plane stalling at 3,000 feet picks up speed as it drops, quickly generates lift, and can resume flight; stall it at 500 feet, however, and before you know it your propeller is ploughing its way across a field, which in the mordant words of my instructor Tim, 'exceeds its design specification'.</p> <p>I was learning to fly with half-dozen trainee commercial pilots, and conversation often revolved around aviation's unspoken freemasonic secret: the fact that it's dangerous. (Q: 'What's the definition of a good landing? A: One that you can walk away from.') Pilots naturally tend to a gallows humour: they know theirs is a job where failure can wipe the smiles off 300 holidaymakers. I've never forgotten the visual gag in Airplane, where the in-flight movie contentedly watched by passive, post-prandial passengers is a montage of aircraft crashes and great balls of fire. When I first saw the film the audience's laughter was edged with hysteria - this was a taboo flamboyantly transgressed, a joke that stirred our most assiduously buried fears.</p> <p>The airliner is an aseptic high technology, close for most of us to brain surgery and rocket science. We all made paper aeroplanes at school, but the spectacle of a 365-ton jumbo jet ponderously mounting the air fills us with a superstitious sense of nature violated.</p> <p>Consider the morbid press ecstasies whenever one of the slender aluminium tubes plunges into ocean, mountain or municipal housing unit. We are happy to drive along a wet motorway at 90 with spouse and new-born sleeping beside us - that's acceptable risk (it's a statistical fact that planes are safer than family cars); but when Concorde, with its hitherto 100 per cent safety record, experiences a freak accident, we are irrationally disturbed.</p> <p>In flight, we behave as though we're not. The cabin staff's professional grins, the videos and Muzak all conspire to distract us from the terrifying miracle of flight. Magic seeks to appease the Gods, and flight is unquestionably magic; passengers know they have propitiated no one, signed no Faustian pact - they are exposed. Just two trembling wings and a clutch of fallible engines keep them airborne. And what about Human Error? The technology depends on two gold-braided fly-boys (they're usually male) up front, and recent events (the Russian pilot who let his knee-dandled son plough a plane into the ground, those heavy-drinking BA pilots) have taught us they're not angels. Taxiing up to take-off one morning, my plane skewed to the left. I shut the engine down and went to look for Paul, the mechanic. I found him with his head inside a deconstructed Cessna.</p> <p>'Paul, I have a Situation.'</p> <p>'Whassat?'</p> <p>'Left brake locked on taxi.'</p> <p>He pulled himself out of the fuselage, wiped his hands on his overalls and picked up a hammer.</p> <p>'Is that what you need?' I asked.</p> <p>'It fixes most things.'</p> <p>He beat the brake pads and, achieving no result, grunted and stuck his head under the dashboard. I went to find a coat against the Canadian autumn winds. When I returned, Paul was smiling. 'You're lucky it didn't lock a couple of minutes later, when you were landing. Woulda spun you right off the runway.'</p> <p>'Oh. Is it safe now?'</p> <p>'Safe is a relative term, my friend. I keep both my feet on the ground.'</p> <p>In the mid-1960s, my father took a job with the UN, and we as a family were en route to Turkey via Rome. The era of flight as mass transit had arrived with the plane we were flying - a Boeing 707 - but flight was still romantic then, and Pan American had yet to become a victim of deregulated airways and go bust. Our Boeing was curvaceous, and the miniskirted hostesses who wore crisp, virtually seamless dresses like those in Kubrick's 2001 gave us children crayons and colouring books. The outline drawings all showed airliners and airports, and trilbied, suited emissaries of capitalism grinning as they passed through sleek and streamlined terminals, utopian symbols of Modernity. What happened to it all? When did the giddy romance of flight implode into the banality of mass tourism, where every grey terminal resembles every other, with the numbing inevitabilities of the X-ray machine and the stuttering Baggage Claim carousel?</p> <p>Yet there are still thousands of courageous, wary figures who wrestle small planes over deserts and choppy seas and fog-covered mountains - planes that have changed little technically in 50 years. There are pilots who live in hangars, sleeping beside their planes, and others who have devoted their lives and chequebooks to the preservation of ancient, impossibly exotic aircraft. Then there are the half-mad aerobatics junkies, the air racers, the exhibition pilots who risk everything to thrill a jaded crowd, and meet their deaths at airshows with sickening regularity. It was to encounter these pilots, all over the world, that I decided to set off on the journey I'll be describing in The Observer.</p> <p> My most memorable flight as a pilot so far came after six weeks in the Canadian skies, soon after I gained my licence. It stirred me (it still does) to wake up and see the leather wallet with Pilot Licence printed on it in gold sitting on the bedside table. That day I woke up early to a bright, cloudless winter sky. Perfect. At the aerodrome I tugged my plane round into the sun's first copper rays, and as they melted the fine layer of iced dew on the wings I completed the flyer's ritual, checking ailerons and rudder and poking a length of dowling into the fuel tanks to be sure that the cockpit gauges didn't lie.</p> <p>Climb in, headphones on, fire her up, taxi onto the runway. Add full power, and the engine is almost brutally alive, the prop jerking the fuselage forward as you accelerate to 10,000 rpm. At around 55 knots you ease back the stick, and there it is - weightlessness, gravity-defiance, the instant miracle of flight, the landscape falling away from you, emerald streaked with early-morning gold.</p> <p><strong>Winging it</strong></p> <p>Martin Buckley sets off this week on his global journey by small aircraft. He begins with a pilgrimage to the workshop in Scarborough where Sir George Cayley built the first manned glider. But soon he will be flying to Paris, Marseilles and on to North Africa.

I grew up in the countryside a few miles from Farnborough, and during the annual airshow I could look up from our back lawn to see the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight pass overhead. It was rare on any summer day for five minutes to go by without the sound of an aeroplane, and we would shade our eyes and wait to capture the silver flash like a fish as it passed, straight and fast, between the chimney and the woods, and we'd try to read its shape against the sky. Now, perversely, I am reassured when the summer silence of the British countryside - the hum of bees, the distant lowing of cows - is disturbed by the faint rumble of an aero engine. This, the rumble says, is how it should be. A few years back I started work on a book about the world's deserts. Early one chilly desert morning on my two-year journey I was standing at the small aerodrome of Nazca, in Peru. The rising sun was staining the jagged Andes red. I climbed into a four-seat Cessna and the pilot, Carlos, fired up the engine. Some things only make sense from the air. Dawn is the best moment to appreciate the Nazca lines, when the shallow ridges are shadowed by the low sun, and the air is clear and vapourless. Climbing over the pampas we soon saw them: hundreds of straight lines scoring the desert, and animal shapes, including the iconic hummingbird with its wings outstretched. They seemed smaller than I expected. 'It's because of our height,' yelled Carlos. 'They're a long way down.' 'Well, can't we go a bit lower?' We dropped out of the dawn-pink sky to buzz the drawings. As we banked tightly they whirled around us - monkey, dog, 'owlman', spider. No one knows why, 1,500 years ago, Nazcans engraved these lines into the desert crust. Erich von Daniken's Chariots of the Gods claimed that they were landing-strips for alien spacecraft; a more plausible theory suggests they played a role in hallucinogenic rituals. Andean museum collections groan with the paraphernalia of shamanistic drug-use, and it was - is - common for shamans in these psychedelic trances to identify with some symbolic creature. Frequently they believe their spirits take to the sky, and soar. Each of the creatures on the Nazcan crust is etched in a single line. Perhaps they were paths, walked by the shamans during their possession by the animal - spiritual, not alien, runways from which the shaman's soul took flight. A few months after that flight, I found myself in the Peruvian Amazon, sitting in a wooden cabin with the velvet night sky overhead and the jungle raucous with insects. A shaman and I had been into the jungle and found the ayahuasca vine, and back at his village had boiled it into a thick, bilious stew. There were four of us on the oil lamp-lit porch, two of them women smoking tobacco pipes. The shaman passed the potion, and while we sipped he hummed a tune, an invocation to the spirits of ayahuasca. Soon the visions began: I was airborne, flying over endless fantastic cityscapes, their gothic towers and frothing parks delirious shades of crimson, lime-green and turquoise. My friend Peter was surely right that as long as man has had an imagination he has dreamt of flight. Fortifications have been constructed at the highest elevations for strategic purposes, but we are also drawn to mountaintops for reasons of the soul. Hilary's conquest of Everest had for the British, in the year of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation, some profounder meaning than a mere sporting record. Close to Everest is the fabulous Mount Meru, navel of the earth, abode of the Hindu gods. The gods of the Greeks and Romans also inhabited the heavens - as do the Trinity and angels, and all the virtuous souls, of Christianity. The centenary of man's first powered flight occurs in two years' time. Orville and Wilbur Wright's Flyer III was a cumbersome machine, its kite-like forward rudder and complex controls in many ways an aeronautical cul-de-sac (it was Bl\u00e9riot's Channel-crossing monoplane that standardised the aeroplane form we know today); but the Flyer changed the world for ever, possibly for the worse. In Baden-Powell's words: 'Wilbur Wright is in possession of a power which controls the fate of nations.' When did humans first fly? The 1965 movie Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines began with a slapstick montage of fur-clad cavemen futilely flapping their arms, and early aviators on primitive hang-gliders dropping like stones. The Chinese had constructed kites of tremendous sophistication and scale by the third century AD, and it's at least possible that people - clinging on or strapped on - took to the air. Everyone knows about the 'balloonist' craze that swept Europe in the eighteenth century in the wake of the Montgolfier brothers' hot-air ascents. But what about Sir George Cayley, MP for Scarborough, who launched a manned glider in 1848? If even a French aviation authority can call Cayley 'the true inventor of the aeroplane and one of the most powerful geniuses in the history of aviation', then it must be true - yet he languishes in obscurity. As for me, I continued to experience livid, full-colour flying dreams into my late teens. If they stopped, perhaps it is because, as the shrinks tell us, flying dreams are associated with sexual longing. I suspect that the improvement in my sex life grounded my dreams. But I seized every opportunity that came my way to fly small aircraft. I was in Kenya when I realised that the subject of my next book would be flight. A contact at Unesco's Nairobi desertification programme had introduced me to his son, a keen amateur pilot, who invited me to go flying with him over the Rift Valley. The problem was, neither of us had enough money to rent a plane. The following afternoon we went out to the airport, and hung around the pilot's clubroom until someone offered to take us up. It was a stunning flight, swooping around the emerald craters of the valley's extinct volcanoes. I discovered something valuable that day: that the owner of a pilot's licence can walk into an aerodrome, get chatting to fellow pilots, and stand a good chance of being offered a ride. Suddenly I had an image of myself 'hitch-hiking' by small plane from one aerodrome to the next - and the idea of Winging It was born, a journey around the planet celebrating the many facets of manned flight - a journey I'll be describing in The Observer over the next few months. So it was that on a glittering late summer afternoon four months ago I found myself at an Ontario airfield, with six weeks in which to gain a flying licence. It was my first day at the school, and I was eager to be up in the air. Who knew how long the weather would hold? Within four hours of climbing off the Airbus, I was at the controls of a Cessna 152. Tim Coombs, my instructor, had shown me the Walk Around: like pioneer aviators, pilots still begin every flight with a physical inspection of the plane, waggling ailerons and rudder, poking a stick in the fuel tank to check the fuel level (gauges can be unreliable), and carefully monitoring the engine's performance. To the uninitiated this behaviour implies severe doubts about the plane's airworthiness, but this is the aviator's Highway Code: when cars break down, you coast onto the hard shoulder, but aeroplanes are less forgiving, so they simply aren't allowed to go wrong. Instructors like to build your confidence fast, and they usually have you take off first time (it's landing that requires the skill). With a delicate shudder the fragile three-wheeled machine takes off, a winged Reliant Robin improbably airborne. Within a fortnight I was learning how to enter and recover from the spins and spiral dives we've all seen in war movies, manoeuvres which place the pilot within seconds of death. I began by dreading these nauseating exercises, but ended up taking a grim pleasure in being able to pull them off (that is, pull out of them); maybe one day I'll even start to like them. Certainly, they give you confidence in your ability to handle a plane. The British have removed these perilous techniques from the flying syllabus - making us, according to one Canadian pilot, 'a bunch of woossies'. Over the next six weeks I flew tiny trainers, a bulbous, leather-seated vintage Cessna (the 1954 equivalent of business jet) and a floatplane that scudded over the placid, pea-green lakes of northern Ontario. Cruising at 95 knots, I learned that unlike cars, planes can crash from being flown too slowly: the air passing over the wings is suddenly insufficient to generate lift, and the plane 'stalls'. This usually occurs when a pilot is so intent on giving passengers a bird's-eye-view of, say, his new swimming pool, that he takes his eye off the speedo. A plane stalling at 3,000 feet picks up speed as it drops, quickly generates lift, and can resume flight; stall it at 500 feet, however, and before you know it your propeller is ploughing its way across a field, which in the mordant words of my instructor Tim, 'exceeds its design specification'. I was learning to fly with half-dozen trainee commercial pilots, and conversation often revolved around aviation's unspoken freemasonic secret: the fact that it's dangerous. (Q: 'What's the definition of a good landing? A: One that you can walk away from.') Pilots naturally tend to a gallows humour: they know theirs is a job where failure can wipe the smiles off 300 holidaymakers. I've never forgotten the visual gag in Airplane, where the in-flight movie contentedly watched by passive, post-prandial passengers is a montage of aircraft crashes and great balls of fire. When I first saw the film the audience's laughter was edged with hysteria - this was a taboo flamboyantly transgressed, a joke that stirred our most assiduously buried fears. The airliner is an aseptic high technology, close for most of us to brain surgery and rocket science. We all made paper aeroplanes at school, but the spectacle of a 365-ton jumbo jet ponderously mounting the air fills us with a superstitious sense of nature violated. Consider the morbid press ecstasies whenever one of the slender aluminium tubes plunges into ocean, mountain or municipal housing unit. We are happy to drive along a wet motorway at 90 with spouse and new-born sleeping beside us - that's acceptable risk (it's a statistical fact that planes are safer than family cars); but when Concorde, with its hitherto 100 per cent safety record, experiences a freak accident, we are irrationally disturbed. In flight, we behave as though we're not. The cabin staff's professional grins, the videos and Muzak all conspire to distract us from the terrifying miracle of flight. Magic seeks to appease the Gods, and flight is unquestionably magic; passengers know they have propitiated no one, signed no Faustian pact - they are exposed. Just two trembling wings and a clutch of fallible engines keep them airborne. And what about Human Error? The technology depends on two gold-braided fly-boys (they're usually male) up front, and recent events (the Russian pilot who let his knee-dandled son plough a plane into the ground, those heavy-drinking BA pilots) have taught us they're not angels. Taxiing up to take-off one morning, my plane skewed to the left. I shut the engine down and went to look for Paul, the mechanic. I found him with his head inside a deconstructed Cessna. 'Paul, I have a Situation.' 'Whassat?' 'Left brake locked on taxi.' He pulled himself out of the fuselage, wiped his hands on his overalls and picked up a hammer. 'Is that what you need?' I asked. 'It fixes most things.' He beat the brake pads and, achieving no result, grunted and stuck his head under the dashboard. I went to find a coat against the Canadian autumn winds. When I returned, Paul was smiling. 'You're lucky it didn't lock a couple of minutes later, when you were landing. Woulda spun you right off the runway.' 'Oh. Is it safe now?' 'Safe is a relative term, my friend. I keep both my feet on the ground.' In the mid-1960s, my father took a job with the UN, and we as a family were en route to Turkey via Rome. The era of flight as mass transit had arrived with the plane we were flying - a Boeing 707 - but flight was still romantic then, and Pan American had yet to become a victim of deregulated airways and go bust. Our Boeing was curvaceous, and the miniskirted hostesses who wore crisp, virtually seamless dresses like those in Kubrick's 2001 gave us children crayons and colouring books. The outline drawings all showed airliners and airports, and trilbied, suited emissaries of capitalism grinning as they passed through sleek and streamlined terminals, utopian symbols of Modernity. What happened to it all? When did the giddy romance of flight implode into the banality of mass tourism, where every grey terminal resembles every other, with the numbing inevitabilities of the X-ray machine and the stuttering Baggage Claim carousel? Yet there are still thousands of courageous, wary figures who wrestle small planes over deserts and choppy seas and fog-covered mountains - planes that have changed little technically in 50 years. There are pilots who live in hangars, sleeping beside their planes, and others who have devoted their lives and chequebooks to the preservation of ancient, impossibly exotic aircraft. Then there are the half-mad aerobatics junkies, the air racers, the exhibition pilots who risk everything to thrill a jaded crowd, and meet their deaths at airshows with sickening regularity. It was to encounter these pilots, all over the world, that I decided to set off on the journey I'll be describing in The Observer. My most memorable flight as a pilot so far came after six weeks in the Canadian skies, soon after I gained my licence. It stirred me (it still does) to wake up and see the leather wallet with Pilot Licence printed on it in gold sitting on the bedside table. That day I woke up early to a bright, cloudless winter sky. Perfect. At the aerodrome I tugged my plane round into the sun's first copper rays, and as they melted the fine layer of iced dew on the wings I completed the flyer's ritual, checking ailerons and rudder and poking a length of dowling into the fuel tanks to be sure that the cockpit gauges didn't lie. Climb in, headphones on, fire her up, taxi onto the runway. Add full power, and the engine is almost brutally alive, the prop jerking the fuselage forward as you accelerate to 10,000 rpm. At around 55 knots you ease back the stick, and there it is - weightlessness, gravity-defiance, the instant miracle of flight, the landscape falling away from you, emerald streaked with early-morning gold. Winging it Martin Buckley sets off this week on his global journey by small aircraft. He begins with a pilgrimage to the workshop in Scarborough where Sir George Cayley built the first manned glider. But soon he will be flying to Paris, Marseilles and on to North Africa. Observer readers can share Buckley's experiences as he files a fortnightly column from 21 January in Escape based on his research for Winging It, a travel book celebrating manned flight around the world. If you have information to share, you can also contact him en route by emailing mbwingingit@hotmail.com. Buckley's first book Grains of Sand is published in paperback on 29 March (Vintage, \u00a37.99).",

I must admit I hate skiing in poor light. My sense of depth in these conditions is particularly poor. It also doesn't help skiing on telemark skis when you are following someone a decade younger, whose idea of fun is trying to ski backwards at speed on high performance skis or jumping down steep off-piste slopes. Which is, I guess, how we found ourselves after three hours skiing down an icy black, through murky mist, as the last light faded from the day.</p> <p>After a night of snow, day two dawned to pristine blue skies, fresh powder on a firm base, and temperatures, for December, that were almost mild enough to allow skiing without a Gore-Tex windproof jacket.</p> <p>So after a quick breakfast, we were off eating up blues, reds and then blacks until the inevitable happened, the egging-on-thing got silly.

In the decade and a half in which I have been going to Tignes the quality of everything has been raised from mountain restaurants to the ski lifts which are going through a process of gradually being upgraded - although the high speed funicular from Val D'Is\u00e8re has been closed for safety checks in the wake of the Kaprun disaster.</p> <p>And if you like skiing with your countrymen then Tignes is also the place for you, particularly early in the season when prices are at their most appealing for bargain-hunting Brits.</p> <p>Where Tignes falls down if anywhere, however, is in the quality of the nightlife. There are some pleasant enough bars, including the British run Censored, but resort restaurants and watering holes are pretty much the same unless you go to Val D'Is\u00e8re.

There is something, too, about creeping up the 20 kilometres of switchbacks above the neighbouring resorts of Les Arcs and Val Thorens that always cranks up the anticipation, spotting familiar landmarks along the way until, finally, the dam is crossed, and you have arrived. What I like about Tignes too is that it is a resort where the skiing caters for all abilities: long swooping, gentle greens and blues, steep enough to challenge the most ambitious beginners, leading to reds and blacks and off-piste steep shots that will keep even the most ambitious of experts happy. And here we were, driving into town after a pleasant two-hour pootle from Geneva along Lac Annecy to Albertville. I must admit I hate skiing in poor light. My sense of depth in these conditions is particularly poor. It also doesn't help skiing on telemark skis when you are following someone a decade younger, whose idea of fun is trying to ski backwards at speed on high performance skis or jumping down steep off-piste slopes. Which is, I guess, how we found ourselves after three hours skiing down an icy black, through murky mist, as the last light faded from the day. After a night of snow, day two dawned to pristine blue skies, fresh powder on a firm base, and temperatures, for December, that were almost mild enough to allow skiing without a Gore-Tex windproof jacket. So after a quick breakfast, we were off eating up blues, reds and then blacks until the inevitable happened, the egging-on-thing got silly. (And how is it that no matter how tightly you have done up your jacket, when you land in a snowdrift head first snow always shoots right down to the small of your back?) Tooling round the slopes, one notices that Tignes and neighbouring Val D'Is\u00e8re have really picked up their game. In the decade and a half in which I have been going to Tignes the quality of everything has been raised from mountain restaurants to the ski lifts which are going through a process of gradually being upgraded - although the high speed funicular from Val D'Is\u00e8re has been closed for safety checks in the wake of the Kaprun disaster. And if you like skiing with your countrymen then Tignes is also the place for you, particularly early in the season when prices are at their most appealing for bargain-hunting Brits. Where Tignes falls down if anywhere, however, is in the quality of the nightlife. There are some pleasant enough bars, including the British run Censored, but resort restaurants and watering holes are pretty much the same unless you go to Val D'Is\u00e8re. But this doesn't matter, for the skiing will call you back again and again. Tignes factfile Linked with Val D'Is\u00e8re as L'Espace Killy. Number of lifts: 96, leading to 200 miles of piste (60 per cent green/blue; 30 per cent red; 10 per cent black). Six-day L'Espace Killy lift pass bought at resort costs 1,070 francs (\u00a3103). Check your tour operator's pre-bookable price. Limited summer skiing on the Grande Motte glacier. Tignes features in the brochures of all the leading tour operators. Sample price: \u00a3259 with Crystal (0870 848 7000), based on four people sharing a self-catering apartment. Chalet board starts at \u00a3445. Both with flights from Gatwick.",

      "body": "<p>Imagine no John Lennon, I wonder if you can. Of course you can't. No other pop star has stained our era quite so indelibly, inspired love, admiration and anger on such a scale. As Beatle one, two, three or four (let's not haggle over that fruitless pecking order) he bequeathed what remains, arguably, pop's greatest and most influential canon of work. And alone among all the early, pointless, squalid deaths that litter pop history, his alone was the result of an assassination.</p> <p>That 20 years after his murder, John Lennon continues to exercise a powerful grip on the imagination of a worldwide public, is underscored by the election of 'Imagine' as the No 1 of UK number ones in Channel 4's current poll.</p> <p>Hardly a surprise perhaps. With its utopian sentiments, solemn piano coda and wistful vocals, 'Imagine' has become the premier item in pop's slim hymnal, edging McCartney's 'Let It Be' into second place, with Simon and Garfunkel's 'Bridge Over Troubled Water' among the lighter-waving also-rans. The song may exhort us to 'imagine no religion' and 'no hell or heaven', but its celestial imagery ('above us only sky') and tone are clearly spiritual and aspirational. Surprisingly, 'Imagine' was not a British single until 1975, perhaps because Imagine the album soared to the top of the charts on its release in October 1971, two days before Lennon's 31st birthday, becoming the most successful record of Lennon's post-Beatles career. In the States, the song climbed to number two on the Cashbox charts, but 'Imagine' did not become a UK No 1 until Lennon's murder in December 1980 sent it there, borne aloft on a tide of sorrow. </p> <p>Since then it's never been absent for long, reappearing in 1988 and 1999, when it was short-listed for the already forgotten 'Song of The Millennium' (a Westlife Abba cover, supposedly). 'Imagine' is simply in the ether; for example, in an initiative sponsored by the United Nations on Lennon's 50th birthday in October 1990, the song was broadcast by more than 1,000 radio stations in over 50 countries.</p> <p>Exactly what the world is celebrating through 'Imagine' is less easily nailed down. Chiefly, one suspects, it's the memory of Lennon himself, the fallen hero and rock martyr, who thanks in no small part to Yoko Ono's solicitous guarding of her husband's legend, has long acceded to saint-like status.</p> <p>'Imagine' has been the major theme tune to Lennon's canonisation. The accompanying proto-video, shot at the Lennons' Ascot mansion as part of Gimme Some Truth, a documentary film on the making of Imagine, has played a vital role. In an all-white drawing room, furnished only with an acre of white carpet, a Perspex table, and an all-white chess set, an unusually well-scrubbed John Lennon plays a white baby grand (a present to Yoko from him). As he gazes earnestly ahead, Yoko, in white dress and Cleopatra headband, floats from window to window, opening shutters, spilling light into the room. </p> <p>The scene remains one of the most resonant images of John and Yoko's life together, presenting them as a pair of pure hearts wrapped in their idyll, yearning for a better world. The reality was somewhat different. The Ascot mansion was abandoned for New York City shortly afterwards, and within two years John and Yoko broke up for Lennon's notorious 18-month 'lost weekend'. </p> <p>The real Lennon was certainly no enlightened saint sequestered in a pristine sitting room, but an artist with a volatile temper and an acid wit, a man who wrestled privately and publicly with a host of inner demons, and who was by turns charming, funny, brilliant and scary.</p> <p>That all too human Lennon, recently described by Paul McCartney as 'a delicious broth of a boy', can be glimpsed easily enough on Gimme Some Truth (re-released on DVD last year), and stands naked on Plastic Ono Band, the 'primal' album he made just 10 months before Imagine. It is the mawkish idealist of 'Imagine' who is most often held up for admiration and ridicule, however.</p> <p>For Albert Goldman, most scabrous (and revealing) of Lennon's critics, 'Imagine' is 'a hippie wishing well full of pennyweight dreams for a better world'. The song certainly glides on the airiest of utopian notions, while Lennon's urging us to 'imagine no possessions' is, at best, ironic coming from a millionaire rock star, gazing over seventy private acres of rolling Surrey woodland.</p> <p>Charges of hypocrisy are wide of the mark, though. Lennon believed in a better world and fought for it in his way. To him, 'Imagine' was 'Working Class Hero' with chocolate on 'anti-religious, anti-nationalistic, anti-conventional, anti-capitalistic - but because it is sugar coated it is accepted'.</p> <p>The song's inspiration was two-fold.

      "bodyText": "Imagine no John Lennon, I wonder if you can. Of course you can't. No other pop star has stained our era quite so indelibly, inspired love, admiration and anger on such a scale. As Beatle one, two, three or four (let's not haggle over that fruitless pecking order) he bequeathed what remains, arguably, pop's greatest and most influential canon of work. And alone among all the early, pointless, squalid deaths that litter pop history, his alone was the result of an assassination. That 20 years after his murder, John Lennon continues to exercise a powerful grip on the imagination of a worldwide public, is underscored by the election of 'Imagine' as the No 1 of UK number ones in Channel 4's current poll. Hardly a surprise perhaps. With its utopian sentiments, solemn piano coda and wistful vocals, 'Imagine' has become the premier item in pop's slim hymnal, edging McCartney's 'Let It Be' into second place, with Simon and Garfunkel's 'Bridge Over Troubled Water' among the lighter-waving also-rans. The song may exhort us to 'imagine no religion' and 'no hell or heaven', but its celestial imagery ('above us only sky') and tone are clearly spiritual and aspirational. Surprisingly, 'Imagine' was not a British single until 1975, perhaps because Imagine the album soared to the top of the charts on its release in October 1971, two days before Lennon's 31st birthday, becoming the most successful record of Lennon's post-Beatles career. In the States, the song climbed to number two on the Cashbox charts, but 'Imagine' did not become a UK No 1 until Lennon's murder in December 1980 sent it there, borne aloft on a tide of sorrow. Since then it's never been absent for long, reappearing in 1988 and 1999, when it was short-listed for the already forgotten 'Song of The Millennium' (a Westlife Abba cover, supposedly). 'Imagine' is simply in the ether; for example, in an initiative sponsored by the United Nations on Lennon's 50th birthday in October 1990, the song was broadcast by more than 1,000 radio stations in over 50 countries. Exactly what the world is celebrating through 'Imagine' is less easily nailed down. Chiefly, one suspects, it's the memory of Lennon himself, the fallen hero and rock martyr, who thanks in no small part to Yoko Ono's solicitous guarding of her husband's legend, has long acceded to saint-like status. 'Imagine' has been the major theme tune to Lennon's canonisation. The accompanying proto-video, shot at the Lennons' Ascot mansion as part of Gimme Some Truth, a documentary film on the making of Imagine, has played a vital role. In an all-white drawing room, furnished only with an acre of white carpet, a Perspex table, and an all-white chess set, an unusually well-scrubbed John Lennon plays a white baby grand (a present to Yoko from him). As he gazes earnestly ahead, Yoko, in white dress and Cleopatra headband, floats from window to window, opening shutters, spilling light into the room. The scene remains one of the most resonant images of John and Yoko's life together, presenting them as a pair of pure hearts wrapped in their idyll, yearning for a better world. The reality was somewhat different. The Ascot mansion was abandoned for New York City shortly afterwards, and within two years John and Yoko broke up for Lennon's notorious 18-month 'lost weekend'. The real Lennon was certainly no enlightened saint sequestered in a pristine sitting room, but an artist with a volatile temper and an acid wit, a man who wrestled privately and publicly with a host of inner demons, and who was by turns charming, funny, brilliant and scary. That all too human Lennon, recently described by Paul McCartney as 'a delicious broth of a boy', can be glimpsed easily enough on Gimme Some Truth (re-released on DVD last year), and stands naked on Plastic Ono Band, the 'primal' album he made just 10 months before Imagine. It is the mawkish idealist of 'Imagine' who is most often held up for admiration and ridicule, however. For Albert Goldman, most scabrous (and revealing) of Lennon's critics, 'Imagine' is 'a hippie wishing well full of pennyweight dreams for a better world'. The song certainly glides on the airiest of utopian notions, while Lennon's urging us to 'imagine no possessions' is, at best, ironic coming from a millionaire rock star, gazing over seventy private acres of rolling Surrey woodland. Charges of hypocrisy are wide of the mark, though. Lennon believed in a better world and fought for it in his way. To him, 'Imagine' was 'Working Class Hero' with chocolate on 'anti-religious, anti-nationalistic, anti-conventional, anti-capitalistic - but because it is sugar coated it is accepted'. The song's inspiration was two-fold. Part of it came from Yoko's 1964 book, Grapefruit, which had been republished in 1970, and whose poetic aphorisms ran along the lines of 'Imagine the clouds dripping. Dig a hole in your garden to put them in'. Later, Lennon rued that he hadn't granted his wife a co-writing credit. Then there was the idea of 'positive thinking' that Lennon had picked up from a book of 'positive prayer' that was handed to him by US comedian Dick Gregory. This was the same concept which had inspired his and Yoko's campaign that 'War Is Over If You Want It', and in which John maintained a belief for the rest of his life. He observed in 1980 that visualisation and affirmation had become commonplace among sports champions and corporate strategists. 'I believe in the power of mantra,' he said. The global anthem that is 'Imagination' some 30 years on surely proves him right. Imagine: anatomy of the best No 1 single ever Producers: John Lennon, Yoko Ono, Phil Spector Musicians: Lennon, (vocals, piano), Klaus Voormann (bass), Alan White (drums) Recorded: May 1971 at Lennon's house in Ascot.

      "bodyText": "Unions have been told to prepare for the closure of the massive Llanwern steelworks in South Wales, with the loss of 3,000 jobs, as metals giant Corus finalises a savage package of cutbacks and redundancies. Corus directors informed union officials last week that Llanwern, which produces strip steel, would almost certainly be shut when the results of the company's internal review are announced early in February. It also emerged that plans announced in the autumn for the \u00a335 million relining of a blast furnace at the plant have not proceeded. The closure will come as a bitter disappointment to unions and MPs who have lobbied hard against the plant's closure ever since Corus head Sir Brian Moffat announced fresh restructuring in December. Welsh Labour MPs have asked that the decision be delayed until after the general election. One union official said: 'We were informed on Wednesday by the company that the closure of Llanwern will be announced within the next few weeks.' The closure comes as part of a wider review of Corus's operations which is likely to see further job losses at plants in Scunthorpe, Teesside and Rotherham as well as other plants in South Wales. Corus has not yet decided whether it will close Llanwern immediately or in phases. It is due to brief unions this week on its plans. The latest round of cutbacks comes on top of 4,500 job losses announced last summer. Corus has faced the strike threats from the ISTC steel union over plans to achieve this number through compulsory redundancies - a course avoided in the past. Corus has already given notice of compulsory redundancies at Scunthorpe and Teesside. However, it has worked to cut the number of compulsory losses, and is likely to have averted a strike ballot at Scunthorpe by ensuring there will be none there. It has reduced the cut at Teesside to about 75. However, it added that there would probably be further compulsory losses elsewhere. ISTC head Michael Leahy said compulsory redundancies would result in strike ballots, but welcomed efforts to reduce the number.",

      "trailText": "Advice on play, health, wellbeing, nutrition and fitness.",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<b> Play</b> <br>Pat Kane <p> <b> 45 </b> Do a play audit of your life - start by taking yourself into a pleasant caf\u00e9 in the middle of a working afternoon and asking yourself some simple questions. When I am at my happiest? What am I actually doing? Who am I doing it with? What resources of time, space and money am I deploying to achieve it? When you write your list, don't be embarrassed by anything you put down - whether it's grandiose (saving the world), banal (riding your techno-scooter) or very momentary and private (one night of the best sex ever). Look at it - and there's the beginnings of your play ethic. </p> <p> <b> 46 </b> Savour the ineffability of the urban moment. You know, when the winter sun hits the old stone wall over the motorway bypass, and you get the longest-possible look at a troubled but gorgeous passer-by, while all the crap in your life is slowly washed away inside you. Recognise that moment? Well, treasure it. That's when the universe is playing with you. </p> <p> <b> 47 </b> Try some spontaneity. If, for example, you're a long-time fan of someone, write the email now. Is there a bit of tech that would enhance your life? Fill in another credit-card form, now. When you see the loved one, does your heart burst? Let it out, now. Is time ticking on that outrageously simple business idea? Start phoning for money, now. Will that melody never leave your head? Start lustily singing, now. Spontaneity is to play as routine is to work. You need to stretch the muscles. Generate the consequences. See what happens. </p> <p> <b> 48 </b> Become a lifestyle militant in the workplace. Take all holidays, agitate for more, support parental leave, try to get a sabbatical, take a time-raise instead of a pay-raise, get ready to walk if the management turns inhumane, try to take the best of them with you to do something new and better. Sometimes you gotta play rough. </p> <p> <b> 49 </b> Make something beautiful. A complicated meal, a birthday card for a lover, a personal website, a prose poem, one perfect room - it doesn't matter. We all start off playing by pouring passions into materials. We all need constantly to remind ourselves of what that feels like. </p> <p> <b> 50 </b> Pull a tenner out of the wall, hit your local cyber caf\u00e9 and surf like a mutha. Cyberspace is the player's kingdom: uncontrollable, mostly free, endlessly cut-and-pasteable. And, most importantly, sign up with <a href=\"http://www.blink.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.blink.com</a>, which enables you keep all your bookmarks on the web, so you can get to them at any time, home or work. That'll be your net-brain - every player needs one.</p> <p> <b> 51 </b> Kidult out. If you're a parent of a young child, no matter how wound up you are, just make sure you unravel with the toys, join in the minor fantasies, share the raptures with Barbie/Teksta. You're in a moment of great privilege, helping form a soul: don't blow it by thinking about project management. A child is a professor, a minor guru, of play. Sit there and learn from them just where the core energies of being human come from. </p> <p> <b> 52 </b> Make the ultimate soundtrack by tearing into the CD collection, extracting the absolutely best and life-enhancing records, isolating the indisputably major tracks and carefully compose your ultimate playlist. Do it over a few weeks; take your time; get it right. Then make sure that wherever you are, you can stick the earphones in, and disappear into perfection. Players need their portable inspirations: when the tech gets up to speed, we'll be able to do the same for books, movies, TV shows. But right now, only sound can really rock your world. </p> <p> <b> 53 </b> Find people with whom you can publicly share your passions. If you're doing five-a-side with several daft mates every week, or painting your corner of a wall mosaic for a local school, or sharing origami tips in a web-user group, or if you're moving through your t'ai chi in a room full of devotees_ Congrats, you're already playing. Just do more of it. If you're not dipping into any collective passions at all, then find one, quick. Or you'll just dry up and flake away. </p> <p> <b> 54 </b> Become a disciplined psychonaut, meaning that if you're going to alter the brain-chemistry, one way or another, make sure you're in the best of company, using the best of stuff, and intend to have the best of times. Anything less is less than truly playful: no point in largin' it, if the experience crushes you flat. </p> <p> <b> 55 </b> Send a tub of Play-Doh to Gordon Brown, MP. Boy, does that Presbyterian, work-obsessed patriarch need to knead. </p> <p> <b> Health</b> <br>Wendy Moore</p> <p> <b> 56 </b> Remember to laugh. Laughing not only reduces your stress levels, it may even protect against heart attack. Researchers in the US have found that people who are more likely to laugh in difficult or embarrassing situations suffer less heart disease. </p> <p> <b> 57 </b> Get touchy-feely. Testicular cancer is the commonest cancer among men aged 20 to 39 and cases are rising. Although the disease is more than 90 per cent curable, men still die because it is not detected early enough. Now women are being urged to do their bit by checking their partner's testicles for abnormalities. Find out how on <a href=\"http://www.NetDoctor.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.NetDoctor.co.uk</a>.</p> <p> <b> 58 </b> Carry an aspirin. The humble aspirin will not only cure a headache, it may save your life. One soluble aspirin given to someone having a heart attack - experienc ing sudden severe chest pain - reduces the risk of dying, according to the British Heart Foundation. Call medical aid first. </p> <p> <b> 59 </b> Get web-wise. Health information on the internet can be invaluable, useless or downright dangerous. For basic stuff, save yourself time and harm by using a reputable gateway site, such as <a href=\"http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk</a> or the US National Library of Medicine's consumer health site <a href=\"http://www.medlineplus.gov\" target=\"_NEW\">www.medlineplus.gov</a>, both of which have good links. For rarer problems, it is worth a wider search. Sharing information with fellow sufferers can be hugely important. </p> <p> <b> 60 </b> Have a plan for the accidents that do happen. It is not only teenagers who end up with unplanned pregnancies. If you are happy at the prospect, fine. If not, emergency contraception - the morning-after pill - is 99 per cent effective if taken within 61 hours (ideally 24). It's free on prescription or you can buy it over the counter for \u00a319.99 from the end of this month. </p> <p> <b> 61 </b> Get talking. A problem shared really can be a problem halved. Stress is the number one reason for work absence. Talking about it - to colleagues, family or friends - can alleviate the worst pressures, stress-management experts argue. For anonymous conversation, the Samaritans (08457 909 090) are always willing to listen. </p> <p> <b> 62 </b> Quit smoking. (You must have known you wouldn't get through health tips without being told to stop smoking.) Smoking is still the biggest preventable cause of death and disease. Seven out of 10 smokers want to stop. Here's how: nicotine-replacement therapy - patches, gum or inhalers - can double your chances of quitting and Zyban, the anti-smoking aid now on prescription, is less widely tested but shows promising results. For more information, call Quitline (0800 002 200). </p> <p> <b> 63 </b> Be discerning. There are now more alternative therapists in the UK than GPs and we spend more than \u00a3500m annually on complementary remedies. Some are proven to work, such as St John's Wort for depression. Others work better than conventional medicine, such as chiropractic for back pain. Much, however, is unproven and unregulated. Ask for evidence of effectiveness before you pay up. </p> <p> <b> 64 </b> Get fresh. Up to a quarter of us suffer from bad breath regularly. If you suffer - ask a friend for an honest answer - the problem is usually easily cured. Your dentist can advise. Drinking lots of liquids - but not coffee - and chewing carrots can help. </p> <p> <b> 65 </b> Ditch the diet. Almost 60 per cent of us are overweight, increasing health risks significantly, but crash diets are useless - the weight piles back on when the diet ends. The only effective way to lose weight permanently is to change your lifestyle - by eating less fat and exercising more. </p> <p> <b> 66 </b> Get protected. Sexually transmitted diseases are soaring. Cases seen at sexual health clinics - including gonorrhoea, chlamydia and genital warts - have doubled in the last decade. Most are easily prevented and treated. Condoms offer effective protection. If you think you have had risky sex, have a test and get treatment if necessary. </p> <p> <b> Wellbeing</b> <br> Barefoot Doctor</p> <p> <b> 67 </b> Make it your New Year's resolution to use the power of positive thinking. Every day, decide what's bothering you most and use it to form an affirmation. For example, if other people are irritating you, affirm, 'I am amazed by my level of tolerance for others.' </p> <p> <b> 68 </b> Take a good look at what you're wearing - what are you saying to the world? The lighter the colour, the more you deflect the energy of others. That's why doctors wear white. The darker the colour, the more energy you attract and so the more authority you exude - that's why police wear navy. Pick according to the function you'll be performing and add colour that lifts your spirit. </p> <p> <b> 69 </b> Next time you're hurrying down the street oblivious to anything but the 20 messages on your mobile phone, decide to look around instead and focus on the reality of being on a planet that's currently orbiting the nearest star at 66,000mph while simultaneously rotating on its own axis at 1,000mph. It might help to face east in the direction of the spin. This will instantly put life in perspective. </p> <p> <b> 70 </b> Take up a martial art - it's not as difficult as you think - and work on your spirituality by harnessing mind, breath and energy through posture and movement (the merits of yoga and t'ai chi in this respect cannot be extolled enough). </p> <p> <b> 71 </b> Teach yourself to see how all the people in the world are connected by the light of consciousness that imbues all things, events and people (including you) with meaning. With practice, you will learn to see past the surface appearance of people and things to the inner light that animates, envelopes and informs them. This sense of connectedness will help cut down your monthly call charges. </p> <p> <b> 72 </b> Take more time to become aware of your body on a daily basis. Focus on your skeleton and contemplate being only that. Next, be aware of all the soft tissue in your body, including your flesh and organs and contemplate being only that. Now concentrate on all the fluids coursing through your system and contemplate being only fluid. Next, be aware of your nervous system, including your brain and contemplate being only that. This will help you to unhook yourself from the stress of managing the myriad details of daily life and bring you back to the central core of your being. </p> <p> <b> 73 </b> Exercise your heart - keep it open - and strive to love everyone equally (even though it feels impossible right now). Visualise an aperture in the centre of your chest through which you're breathing in and out, then while inhaling imagine you are drawing in the unconditional love of everyone in the world. While exhaling, imagine you're sending your love back out there. </p> <p> <b> 74 </b> Concentrate all your awareness into the centre of your brain, between and behind your eyes, into the 'original cavity of spirit'. Start by doing it with closed eyes then progress to going about your daily business observing and interacting with the world from this vantage point. This will open your 'third eye', which according to yogis is the key not only to enlightenment but to spiritual immortality, too. </p> <p> <b> 75 </b> Train yourself to be aware of all the synchronistic or serendipitous occurrences in your life. The more you focus on them, the more they will occur. This will reaffirm the existence of the underlying pattern which connects us all. </p> <p> <b> 76 </b> Learn the power of prayer. The simplest, most profound prayer is simply 'Thank you!' (Thank you for the magnificence of life.) </p> <p> <b> 77 </b> Pray or wish for the healing of others. Think of someone who can use it and visualise them enveloped in a bright healing light. Sending positivity to others will attract positivity to you threefold (at least). </p> <p> <b> Nutrition</b> <br>Jane Clarke</p> <p> <b> 78 </b> Throw away the scales and pour yourself a glass of wine to celebrate the liberation. If you feel your weight spiralling upwards, make a note of everything you eat for a few days and set about tweaking your weak points immediately. It's much easier to lose a centimetre than an inch. </p> <p> <b> 79 </b> Treat yourself to a couple of quality cups of tea or coffee in the morning - think tea leaves and fresh coffee beans - and take the time to enjoy them. The memory should prevent you from settling for second best later on in the day. </p> <p> <b> 80 </b> Buy a juicer and use it, three times a week (see Nigel Slater, page 48, for some delicious recipes). </p> <p> <b> 81 </b> Nominate your favourite part of your body and flaunt it - focus on the positive attributes, not your blemishes - we all have them. </p> <p> <b> 82 </b> Aim to drink a glass of water every hour, plus one every time you go to the loo - you may feel awash, but remember that every extra pint of water can provide you with an extra 20 per cent of energy. </p> <p> <b> 83 </b> Ditch the habit of eating at your desk - even if you grab just 15 minutes away, you'll get far more enjoyment from your food and feel much more replenished for a change of scenery. </p> <p> <b> 84 </b> Bring three pieces of fruit to work with you in the morning and don't go home with them - hiding them in the desk doesn't count. </p> <p> <b> 85 </b> If you have a special dinner party and want to squeeze into your favourite little number, forget the crash diet and do as the French do - invest in some sexy, supportive underwear (not a contradiction in terms). </p> <p> <b> 86 </b> Take some of the angst out of food shopping and consider setting up a regular organic-box scheme or supermarket delivery to cover the basics. </p> <p> <b> 87 </b> Vow to make this year the year of better sleep - caffeine after midday, excess alcohol, staying up past the point where your body is winding down are all factors that aggravate good sleeping habits. Remember also that an hour before midnight is worth two after and focus on the fact that far from robbing yourself of valuable time today, sleep will energise you for tomorrow.</p> <p><b> 88</b> Give your body a couple of days a week off alcohol - obviously not on the day you throw away the scales.</p> <p><b> Fitness</b><br> Helen Foster</p> <p><b> 89</b> Know how hard to work. There is a perfect effort level for exercise. You'll get maximum results lifting weights that leave you exhausted after 8-12 reps (and you should do three sets of these). For cardiovascular work, aim to reach 70-80 per cent of your maximum heart rate - you'll judge this as 7-8 on an effort scale and it'll mean you'll be able to speak in sentences but not paragraphs!</p> <p><b> 90</b> Give your trainers an audit. Worn-out trainers make your workout harder and put you at risk of injury. You should replace your trainers every 500 miles of running; every 100 hours of other exercise - or when they no longer pass the 'table test' which involves putting the shoes on the table and bending down to look at the heels. If there's more than a 3mm gap between them and the tabletop at the back or sides, your shoes are worn and you need new ones.</p> <p><b> 91</b> Get an aroma-workout. It may sound like nonsense but work by the Nicholas Institute of Sports Medicine and Athletic Trauma in New York has shown that a whiff of peppermint (or a citrusy scent such as orange) can increase energy and make workouts feel easier.</p> <p><b> 92</b> Take up fencing. One of the fastest- growing sports in the UK, fencing firms thighs, flattens stomachs, boosts reflexes and burns around 350 calories an hour. To find out more about the sport, visit www.fencingacademy.com.</p> <p><b> 93</b> Don't break the 48-hour rule. Working out every day is bad for your body, but if you leave more than 48 hours between gym sessions your workout will be harder. This is because when you work out you release mood- and energy-boosting chemicals into your body that hang around for about 48 hours and give you that feelgood buzz earlier in your workout than normal. </p> <p><b> 94</b> Find an exercise buddy - people who do are seven times more likely to stick to their workout than solo exercisers, says a study by Indiana University. Not so good with people seeing you sweat? Log on to www.phys.com and find a virtual buddy to exchange training tips and motivational speeches with.</p> <p><b> 95</b> Get to the core of things: 'core' is this year's fitness buzzword and is being used by teachers and trainers to describe the muscles in our back and abdominals that support the whole body. Expect to see a rash of classes aiming to strengthen them. Leading the pack so far is Core Reebok, which launches in March. Core Reebok uses a revolving board which you sit, stand and lie on to perform strengthening and toning exercises. 'Boosting your core muscles improves your posture which will make everything you do easier,' says core trainer Deborah Norton (her video hits stores in April). </p> <p><b> 96</b> Take your exercise outside. According to the American Council for Exercise(ACE), one of this year's biggest fitness trends will be exercise classes that take place outside and help us get more fresh air and sunshine. Start now by contacting British Military Fitness (0870 241 2517) which does workouts in parks around the UK.</p> <p><b> 97</b> Use the shake-up system. If you do the same workout for more than four weeks, your muscles will stop getting stronger and you will burn fewer calories during the workout. To change your body, you should change what you do with it, at least once a month. So you might take up a new sport; or do your workout in a different order; or switch from long runs to short sprints - anything, in fact, to stop your body getting complacent.</p> <p><b> 98</b> Engage brain before moving muscle. Actually focusing on the part of the body you're using in a workout makes exercise easier and actually boosts strength. You don't even need to go to the gym for it to happen. A study at Manchester Metropolitan University found that 'exercisers' who just imagined they moved a particular muscle triggered electrical stimulation to that muscle and boosted their strength by 16 per cent.</p> <p><b> 99</b> Get a gadget: ACE says 2001 is the year of the computerised workout, predicting that within 12 months we'll be programming our Palm Pilots and Wap phones to remind us to workout and encourage us along while we sweat. Get ahead of the technogame by visiting a gym with Technogym's smart machines (01344 300 236). These use credit-card keys to remember your programme - and if you're not working hard enough they'll let you know or even make things harder for you.

      "bodyText": "Play Pat Kane 45 Do a play audit of your life - start by taking yourself into a pleasant caf\u00e9 in the middle of a working afternoon and asking yourself some simple questions. When I am at my happiest? What am I actually doing? Who am I doing it with? What resources of time, space and money am I deploying to achieve it? When you write your list, don't be embarrassed by anything you put down - whether it's grandiose (saving the world), banal (riding your techno-scooter) or very momentary and private (one night of the best sex ever). Look at it - and there's the beginnings of your play ethic. 46 Savour the ineffability of the urban moment. You know, when the winter sun hits the old stone wall over the motorway bypass, and you get the longest-possible look at a troubled but gorgeous passer-by, while all the crap in your life is slowly washed away inside you. Recognise that moment? Well, treasure it. That's when the universe is playing with you. 47 Try some spontaneity. If, for example, you're a long-time fan of someone, write the email now. Is there a bit of tech that would enhance your life? Fill in another credit-card form, now. When you see the loved one, does your heart burst? Let it out, now. Is time ticking on that outrageously simple business idea? Start phoning for money, now. Will that melody never leave your head? Start lustily singing, now. Spontaneity is to play as routine is to work. You need to stretch the muscles. Generate the consequences. See what happens. 48 Become a lifestyle militant in the workplace. Take all holidays, agitate for more, support parental leave, try to get a sabbatical, take a time-raise instead of a pay-raise, get ready to walk if the management turns inhumane, try to take the best of them with you to do something new and better. Sometimes you gotta play rough. 49 Make something beautiful. A complicated meal, a birthday card for a lover, a personal website, a prose poem, one perfect room - it doesn't matter. We all start off playing by pouring passions into materials. We all need constantly to remind ourselves of what that feels like. 50 Pull a tenner out of the wall, hit your local cyber caf\u00e9 and surf like a mutha. Cyberspace is the player's kingdom: uncontrollable, mostly free, endlessly cut-and-pasteable. And, most importantly, sign up with www.blink.com, which enables you keep all your bookmarks on the web, so you can get to them at any time, home or work. That'll be your net-brain - every player needs one. 51 Kidult out. If you're a parent of a young child, no matter how wound up you are, just make sure you unravel with the toys, join in the minor fantasies, share the raptures with Barbie/Teksta. You're in a moment of great privilege, helping form a soul: don't blow it by thinking about project management. A child is a professor, a minor guru, of play. Sit there and learn from them just where the core energies of being human come from. 52 Make the ultimate soundtrack by tearing into the CD collection, extracting the absolutely best and life-enhancing records, isolating the indisputably major tracks and carefully compose your ultimate playlist. Do it over a few weeks; take your time; get it right. Then make sure that wherever you are, you can stick the earphones in, and disappear into perfection. Players need their portable inspirations: when the tech gets up to speed, we'll be able to do the same for books, movies, TV shows. But right now, only sound can really rock your world. 53 Find people with whom you can publicly share your passions. If you're doing five-a-side with several daft mates every week, or painting your corner of a wall mosaic for a local school, or sharing origami tips in a web-user group, or if you're moving through your t'ai chi in a room full of devotees_ Congrats, you're already playing. Just do more of it. If you're not dipping into any collective passions at all, then find one, quick. Or you'll just dry up and flake away. 54 Become a disciplined psychonaut, meaning that if you're going to alter the brain-chemistry, one way or another, make sure you're in the best of company, using the best of stuff, and intend to have the best of times. Anything less is less than truly playful: no point in largin' it, if the experience crushes you flat. 55 Send a tub of Play-Doh to Gordon Brown, MP. Boy, does that Presbyterian, work-obsessed patriarch need to knead. Health Wendy Moore 56 Remember to laugh. Laughing not only reduces your stress levels, it may even protect against heart attack. Researchers in the US have found that people who are more likely to laugh in difficult or embarrassing situations suffer less heart disease. 57 Get touchy-feely. Testicular cancer is the commonest cancer among men aged 20 to 39 and cases are rising. Although the disease is more than 90 per cent curable, men still die because it is not detected early enough. Now women are being urged to do their bit by checking their partner's testicles for abnormalities. Find out how on www.NetDoctor.co.uk. 58 Carry an aspirin. The humble aspirin will not only cure a headache, it may save your life. One soluble aspirin given to someone having a heart attack - experienc ing sudden severe chest pain - reduces the risk of dying, according to the British Heart Foundation. Call medical aid first. 59 Get web-wise. Health information on the internet can be invaluable, useless or downright dangerous. For basic stuff, save yourself time and harm by using a reputable gateway site, such as www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk or the US National Library of Medicine's consumer health site www.medlineplus.gov, both of which have good links. For rarer problems, it is worth a wider search. Sharing information with fellow sufferers can be hugely important. 60 Have a plan for the accidents that do happen. It is not only teenagers who end up with unplanned pregnancies. If you are happy at the prospect, fine. If not, emergency contraception - the morning-after pill - is 99 per cent effective if taken within 61 hours (ideally 24). It's free on prescription or you can buy it over the counter for \u00a319.99 from the end of this month. 61 Get talking. A problem shared really can be a problem halved. Stress is the number one reason for work absence. Talking about it - to colleagues, family or friends - can alleviate the worst pressures, stress-management experts argue. For anonymous conversation, the Samaritans (08457 909 090) are always willing to listen. 62 Quit smoking. (You must have known you wouldn't get through health tips without being told to stop smoking.) Smoking is still the biggest preventable cause of death and disease. Seven out of 10 smokers want to stop. Here's how: nicotine-replacement therapy - patches, gum or inhalers - can double your chances of quitting and Zyban, the anti-smoking aid now on prescription, is less widely tested but shows promising results. For more information, call Quitline (0800 002 200). 63 Be discerning. There are now more alternative therapists in the UK than GPs and we spend more than \u00a3500m annually on complementary remedies. Some are proven to work, such as St John's Wort for depression. Others work better than conventional medicine, such as chiropractic for back pain. Much, however, is unproven and unregulated. Ask for evidence of effectiveness before you pay up. 64 Get fresh. Up to a quarter of us suffer from bad breath regularly. If you suffer - ask a friend for an honest answer - the problem is usually easily cured. Your dentist can advise. Drinking lots of liquids - but not coffee - and chewing carrots can help. 65 Ditch the diet. Almost 60 per cent of us are overweight, increasing health risks significantly, but crash diets are useless - the weight piles back on when the diet ends. The only effective way to lose weight permanently is to change your lifestyle - by eating less fat and exercising more. 66 Get protected. Sexually transmitted diseases are soaring. Cases seen at sexual health clinics - including gonorrhoea, chlamydia and genital warts - have doubled in the last decade. Most are easily prevented and treated. Condoms offer effective protection. If you think you have had risky sex, have a test and get treatment if necessary. Wellbeing Barefoot Doctor 67 Make it your New Year's resolution to use the power of positive thinking. Every day, decide what's bothering you most and use it to form an affirmation. For example, if other people are irritating you, affirm, 'I am amazed by my level of tolerance for others.' 68 Take a good look at what you're wearing - what are you saying to the world? The lighter the colour, the more you deflect the energy of others. That's why doctors wear white. The darker the colour, the more energy you attract and so the more authority you exude - that's why police wear navy. Pick according to the function you'll be performing and add colour that lifts your spirit. 69 Next time you're hurrying down the street oblivious to anything but the 20 messages on your mobile phone, decide to look around instead and focus on the reality of being on a planet that's currently orbiting the nearest star at 66,000mph while simultaneously rotating on its own axis at 1,000mph. It might help to face east in the direction of the spin. This will instantly put life in perspective. 70 Take up a martial art - it's not as difficult as you think - and work on your spirituality by harnessing mind, breath and energy through posture and movement (the merits of yoga and t'ai chi in this respect cannot be extolled enough). 71 Teach yourself to see how all the people in the world are connected by the light of consciousness that imbues all things, events and people (including you) with meaning. With practice, you will learn to see past the surface appearance of people and things to the inner light that animates, envelopes and informs them. This sense of connectedness will help cut down your monthly call charges. 72 Take more time to become aware of your body on a daily basis. Focus on your skeleton and contemplate being only that. Next, be aware of all the soft tissue in your body, including your flesh and organs and contemplate being only that. Now concentrate on all the fluids coursing through your system and contemplate being only fluid. Next, be aware of your nervous system, including your brain and contemplate being only that. This will help you to unhook yourself from the stress of managing the myriad details of daily life and bring you back to the central core of your being. 73 Exercise your heart - keep it open - and strive to love everyone equally (even though it feels impossible right now). Visualise an aperture in the centre of your chest through which you're breathing in and out, then while inhaling imagine you are drawing in the unconditional love of everyone in the world. While exhaling, imagine you're sending your love back out there. 74 Concentrate all your awareness into the centre of your brain, between and behind your eyes, into the 'original cavity of spirit'. Start by doing it with closed eyes then progress to going about your daily business observing and interacting with the world from this vantage point. This will open your 'third eye', which according to yogis is the key not only to enlightenment but to spiritual immortality, too. 75 Train yourself to be aware of all the synchronistic or serendipitous occurrences in your life. The more you focus on them, the more they will occur. This will reaffirm the existence of the underlying pattern which connects us all. 76 Learn the power of prayer. The simplest, most profound prayer is simply 'Thank you!' (Thank you for the magnificence of life.) 77 Pray or wish for the healing of others. Think of someone who can use it and visualise them enveloped in a bright healing light. Sending positivity to others will attract positivity to you threefold (at least). Nutrition Jane Clarke 78 Throw away the scales and pour yourself a glass of wine to celebrate the liberation. If you feel your weight spiralling upwards, make a note of everything you eat for a few days and set about tweaking your weak points immediately. It's much easier to lose a centimetre than an inch. 79 Treat yourself to a couple of quality cups of tea or coffee in the morning - think tea leaves and fresh coffee beans - and take the time to enjoy them. The memory should prevent you from settling for second best later on in the day. 80 Buy a juicer and use it, three times a week (see Nigel Slater, page 48, for some delicious recipes). 81 Nominate your favourite part of your body and flaunt it - focus on the positive attributes, not your blemishes - we all have them. 82 Aim to drink a glass of water every hour, plus one every time you go to the loo - you may feel awash, but remember that every extra pint of water can provide you with an extra 20 per cent of energy. 83 Ditch the habit of eating at your desk - even if you grab just 15 minutes away, you'll get far more enjoyment from your food and feel much more replenished for a change of scenery. 84 Bring three pieces of fruit to work with you in the morning and don't go home with them - hiding them in the desk doesn't count. 85 If you have a special dinner party and want to squeeze into your favourite little number, forget the crash diet and do as the French do - invest in some sexy, supportive underwear (not a contradiction in terms). 86 Take some of the angst out of food shopping and consider setting up a regular organic-box scheme or supermarket delivery to cover the basics. 87 Vow to make this year the year of better sleep - caffeine after midday, excess alcohol, staying up past the point where your body is winding down are all factors that aggravate good sleeping habits. Remember also that an hour before midnight is worth two after and focus on the fact that far from robbing yourself of valuable time today, sleep will energise you for tomorrow. 88 Give your body a couple of days a week off alcohol - obviously not on the day you throw away the scales. Fitness Helen Foster 89 Know how hard to work. There is a perfect effort level for exercise.

      "body": "<p>Sitting opposite Andre Agassi you notice first something about his eyes. His father saw it, too, when his son was only a few days old. It looked to him then like a special kind of alertness, and Mike Agassi, the tennis coach at the Tropicana Casino in Las Vegas, encouraged that apparent quickness in his baby's attention, hung a tennis ball above his crib and let him bat it back and forth all day with his hand. In the 30 years since, those eyes have studied intently the flight of several million tennis balls, and they now seem to possess an almost supernatural acuity; while Andre Agassi talks, his eyes constantly interrogate you, intensely curious for stress and nuance. They are, as a result, all you really see.</p> <p>In a penthouse hotel bar in Lyon, where he is playing in an end-of season satellite tournament, otherwise slight and unremarkable in a neat grey T-shirt and washed-out jeans, he is looking back unblinking on a year that has been made all the more difficult by the extraordinary triumphant one which preceded it. For a variety of reasons, he says, he has 'lost his focus' over the summer, and the literal implication of that clich\u00e9 seems to trouble him; he has taken his eye off the ball, and for Agassi, these days, that inattention has an almost sacrilegious quality. 'It's been a year that has been physically impairing, and draining, really, and that takes you down a level; its been a difficult year, emotionally and mentally and physically and as a result I feel very far off where I was,' he says, a little wearily. 'Your experience helps speed up the process [of recovery] a lot but you have always to analyse, you know: where is my game? Do I have the ability to still do it?'</p> <p>This time last year, a couple of months before his 30th birthday, Andre Agassi was doing it better than ever, at the peak of an extraordinary resurgence, a comeback unprecedented in modern tennis. Having slipped at one time to 141st in the world, and having been on the verge of quitting, he had rebuilt his game and his life to reach the final of the previous three Grand Slams, winning two, including his emotional triumph in Paris where he completed his full set of the major tournaments, a unique achievement among his generation. He had finished the season as world No 1 and he was preparing for the Australian Open where he would again eclipse his nemesis, Pete Sampras, with faultless, instinctive tennis. </p> <p>By the time Agassi got to Zimbabwe in early February, John McEnroe, his Davis Cup captain, watching him practise (shirtless, of course) was awed by how hard he was hitting the ball; no one, he observed, had ever struck it earlier, or more sweetly. Such perfection, as Agassi knows better than most, can only ever be fleeting, however, and a couple of days later, after he had won his second match in Harare's dry heat and thin air, still jetlagged after a 30-hour flight from Melbourne, he was doubled over and washed up, vomiting into a flowerpot at courtside. He went home under medical supervision, and his confidence and his fitness and his game, he insists, have still not quite recovered. 'That's not an opinion,' he says. 'All you have to do is look at the results. I've had a couple of semis since, and that's it.' </p> <p>Throughout his career, Andre Agassi has dealt only in extremes. 'When I'm in the zone,' he says, 'I go hard,' but that intensity extracts a toll. As a baseliner, and moreover one who, at 5ft 11in, lacks the imposing physical stature of most of the players on the tour, Agassi puts his body under absolute strain to compete (Bjorn Borg, the only baseline player in recent decades to achieve his level of success, retired from competitive tennis at 26). And the vulnerability of his highly strung frame is more than matched by his apparent emotional rawness: his heart constantly competes for space with the indentured Nike swoosh on his sleeve. Agassi's dip in form this time around has been exacerbated not only by a succession of injuries but also by the devastating news in the summer that both his mother, and his sister, Tammee, were suffering from breast cancer. It has, he says, ever since, been far too easy to separate tennis from the rest of his life: 'because you have no question where you want to put your energies.'</p> <p> Although he has been trying to spend as much time as he can with his family - he withdrew in September from the defence of his Olympic title - he has not, at this stage in his career, felt able to take a substantial break from the game: 'I can't afford to take months off,' he says. 'If I did that I could never come back. I try instead to balance it. But it is hard to compete while you are still consumed with thoughts of \"where am I?\"' Still, he says, philosophically, 'I've taken some time away, and all things considered, my family is doing well'</p> <p> There are few sports that so relentlessly expose the individual to psychological scrutiny as tennis, and Andre Agassi's personal rites of passage over the 15 years since he turned professional have been the most vivid of its spectacles. He refers to the game, more often than not, in abstract, metaphysical terms, presumably because it has always meant so much more to him than simply hitting the balls. 'You don't know anything else when you start playing before you can remember,' he explains, with a kind of sadness, of his growing up on court. 'I did not know life away from it. It's kind of like a tortured soul, you know, you have a choice but you don't have a choice. There are times when you look forward to quitting and times when you don't imagine ever possibly doing anything different.'</p> <p>It is the presentation of this internal drama, that has, in the past decade or so, made Agassi among the most compelling of all sports stars, an archetypal figure for our neurotic and solipsistic times. No tennis player in that period has seemed so at odds with his gifts, or so questioning of his purpose. Even now, having achieved much of what he set out to achieve, when he talks about tennis it is as if, at times, you are listening to Hamlet quibble with mortality. 'At the end of the day I need to do it or not do it,' Agassi tells me at one point, 'that has always been the question for me. The question of not doing this thing I was kind of born to do has been with me for 15 years It's been hard to ignore it at times. But I've had to think about it and answer it, get on the plane and do it again'</p> <p>As a younger man he seemed sometimes to be losing the battle with this question, intent on squandering his talent, the prodigy who could not grow up. He turned professional in a blaze of hype at 16, but by the age of 21 he seemed already strung out, eating badly, losing games for fun, his ever-changing appearance apparently reflecting his fragile self-esteem: first he shaved his head, then grew a tall mohican, then bleached it, before finally settling on a shaggy shoulder length highlighted perm. At one tournament in Florida, when in his teens, he turned up on court wearing torn-off jeans, lipstick and eyeliner (the black socks and day-Glo shirts came later) . Looking back on that time, he reflects that 'maybe I was rewarded too quickly. I came at a time when tennis needed somebody - when tennis was looking for another American. I had so much notoriety before I had really accomplished great things. For me to be doing Nike commercials and Canon commercials and never winning a Grand Slam - that left me with a bad rap - all image and no substance' </p> <p>The trajectory of Agassi's career to that point seemed like a blueprint for underachieving angst. At times, like many of the tennis stars of his generation, he seemed trapped in his father's dreams rather than his own. Mike Agassi's obsession with his son's success set something of the pattern for the more infamous tennis dads who followed him. Like many of them, he was a first generation immigrant to the States, desperately looking to find a foothold for his family, and tennis seemed like an ideal entr\u00e9e into the American dream. </p> <p> Mike Agassi already knew all about fighting his way to the top: he represented his native Iran as a boxer in the Olympics at 17, and having emigrated to America was Golden Gloves champion of Chicago three years running. On the night he was to turn pro, however, like a character in a Hemingway short story, he escaped from Madison Square Garden through a bathroom window a few minutes before his debut bout was due to start. The next morning, he bought a tennis racket, so the story goes, headed west, and never looked back.</p> <p> Drifting to Las Vegas, he found himself work as a tennis pro and waiter in the casino hotels. He studied everything he could about the game: from laying courts to preparing equipment, and set himself up in business, stringing the rackets of the tennis and entertainment stars who passed through. Most of Mike Agassi's considerable energies however, were directed toward coaching his four children. The three eldest - Rita, Philip and Tammee - were all schooled daily using tennis serving machines that their father had adapted to fire balls at a higher than normal velocity, on the court he had laid himself in their backyard. By the time Andre was born in 1970, Mike Agassi had his methods honed: he taped a racket to his youngest son's hand as soon as he could walk, had him serving over arm on a full-sized court by the time he was two. 'It's easy to tell people to bend their knees and get the racket back, there are 12 or 15 tips that all the pros know,' recalled Mike Agassi of his methods subsequently, 'but there's nobody to teach you how to hit a ball at 125 mph, say, or with no pace at all.'</p> <p> Mike Agassi aimed to teach his son just that, and to set his sights high. When Jimmy Connors was in town, Agassi persuaded him to knock up with his four-year-old genius; Borg hit a few balls with him, too, and smiled, so the legend has it, at the way they were returned with interest. Andre's sisters and brother were also developing into good players (Rita eventually achieved a top 100 ranking on the women's tour) but little Andre seemed something special. By the age of 10 he was winning tournaments in California in the company of a highly charged group of young players that included Jim Courier and Michael Chang and Pete Sampras (he was also praying for rain in the Nevada Desert so he could be allowed to take a day off). By the age of 13, when his father thought he could not teach him any more, he was packed off to Nick Bolletieri's tennis boot camp in Florida; three years later he had turned professional; and two years after that he was ranked No 3 in the world, heir apparent as American 'personality' on the circuit to Connors and McEnroe. </p> <p> Something at that time, though, always seemed to be missing from Agassi's game. Though he did well in some tournaments, they were never the tournaments that really mattered, and as his confidence slipped, so did his ranking. (At one point, in those days, Connors remarked of the over-exposed pretender that 'God, in our day at least we used to win') Agassi looked set to be another Carling Bassett or Jennifer Capriati, the driven child star who could not quite hack it with the grown-ups. Looking back he says his mind was never really on the court, at the time - nor his heart. 'I thought I could just go out there and hit harder than the other guy.' he says. 'Players knew that even when I was playing well, if they could just hang in there long enough I would give the match away'</p> <p> The first turning point for Agassi came at Wimbledon. It was the tournament that he so little expected to win with his game that for the first three years of his career he did not play it at all. In 1992, though, through sheer force of will, he overcame Goran Ivanisevic who, during the tournament, had broken all serving records - and opened a debate as to whether there should be changes in the law to preserve the game as a spectacle. Ivanisevic produced more than a set's worth of aces in the five-set final, but they were not enough to break Agassi's unexpected resolve. Afterwards, when Agassi smiled paternally down at the trophy in the crook of his arm, it seemed like something more than a coming of age for him. Recalling that moment, he relives its significance. 'Tennis has always been a vehicle for me to challenge myself and look into myself and become more of who it is I want to be,' he explains. 'And that moment was one of the greatest because when I look at it in photographs now, it is for me about so much more than tennis; cradling the trophy was me embracing what was not even a dream, but more fears and doubts and questions about losing three Grand Slam finals, and being told by more than just the media that this was something I couldn't win. That is the kind of moment that makes sport great: it had so much more to it for me than the game of tennis.'</p> <p> If in that moment, Agassi had proved to himself he could 'just do it' - as his sponsor had long been expensively proclaiming - it took a good deal more soul-searching to enable him to repeat the process with any degree of certainty. In the years since Agassi has made himself something of an icon for the self-help industry, a case study for our times. At around the time of his Wimbledon triumph he put himself into therapy, and spent some time with Californian motivational speakers like Anthony Robbins (author of Unlimited Power, creator of 'the new science of personal achievement') . He also immersed himself in a customised new age Christianity. When he was first on the circuit he would study the Bible with Michael Chang on rest days during tournaments. He would talk about his faith, too, with reporters, explain how it had changed his life, but for a while now, he has not felt the need 'to pick up God's slack' in this way. (When I ask him about his religion, he replies only with a caveat: 'I'm not religious, but I have my faith. Religion to me is one guy telling some other guy how and what and when and why. But faith certainly is very important to me.')</p> <p> His friend Barbra Streisand, the high priestess of self-fulfilment, who sometimes jetted in to see his tournaments, once famously called him 'a Zen master'; and certainly, when you ask him, he talks about his tennis as a kind of spiritual journey. In response to an innocuous question about the goals he sets himself in the game these days, for example, he speaks, typically, as if of a pilgrim's progress:'You discover more each day about who it is you want to be,' he suggests, 'and how you want to be, and once you discover it you are only half way there, after that it is about living up to it over and over again and failing at it a number of times'</p> <p> Agassi's failings tended to increase, it seemed, at around the time of his brief, ill-fated marriage to Brooke Shields. He had first got together with Shields in 1993; though initially their relationship, suggested by a mutual friend Lyndie Benson, the wife of saxophonist Kenny G, was conducted through daily faxes - Shields was away on location in Africa - in which each slowly bared their soul. Shields's grandfather had been a US Open finalist, but they shared therapyspeak rather than on-court chemistry; when she returned they talked on the phone every day for six weeks, before they finally met each other at the end of the year.</p> <p> At the time, Agassi told Esquire magazine that he and Shields were made for each other, a pair of damaged souls who could put each other back together: 'We've both gone through the same things,' he said, ever earnest. 'We were both celebrities young. We were both thrown into a strange lifestyle young, and we both got bad raps when we were young, so we have a similar history together. And I think both of us haven't maximised our abilities. But that's changing.' These hopes for his relationship with Shields - that it would resurrect his game - slowly proved unfounded, however; they were married in 1997, by which time Agassi was at his lowest point in tennis terms, rarely playing, and mostly losing when he did. He won't talk in public about that period now, except to say, smiling that, 'with my game, it was not easy for me to drop that far down, to be ranked at 140. I had to put in a great deal of hard work at the buffet table to achieve that, a great deal of work'</p> <p> Oddly, soon after he was married and with his career virtually on hold, Agassi apparently made the decision to finally commit himself to his first love. At 27, when some of his contemporaries were giving up on the game, he set himself the target of fulfilling his dim and distant potential, but this time for himself rather than for anyone else. 'I'm very challenged by it, by this starting over,' he said. 'Sometimes it makes me happy with myself in a calm way, sometimes in a sick, demented way I've played this game for a lot of reasons, and none of them have ever quite been my own, but this time my desire is to get out there and enjoy it'</p> <p>Many sportsmen dream of comebacks, but only the greatest ever achieve them. The defining factor in this rehabilitation perhaps came from another, more straightforward relationship, one that also began in 1993. Brad Gilbert had through the Eighties been the player on tour who had done most to maximise a limited talent. His high school coach had noted of him that he had 'No forehand. No backhand. No volley. Weak serve,' but also that he 'wins matches'. Gilbert delighted in proving that even the best could be beaten by application and mental toughness (at one changeover in the Masters tournament in 1986, John McEnroe told Gilbert: 'You don't deserve to be on the same court as me! You are the worst, the fucking worst!' he went on to lose, and afterwards talked for the first time about retirement.) </p> <p> Gilbert wrote a book about his approach called Winning Ugly; intrigued, and after having been dumped by his long-time coach Bolletieri (who took up with Boris Becker), Agassi asked Gilbert if he could help him out. Gilbert's great strength was that he could not bear to see Agassi (who looked to him 'like a poster boy for the caffeine industry') waste his talent, but he also knew all too well that talent alone did not make a champion. 'Brad could not believe it,' Agassi observes of their differing approaches, 'when I told him that sometimes I'd decide where I was going to hit my serve during the ball toss. For Brad, that was unacceptable because he was the kind of player who would think about where he was going to hit the serve two weeks before the toss' </p> <p>Above all, Gilbert forced Agassi to believe that he could become what he has become. Watching Agassi train with his coach in Lyon, you can see how Gilbert has helped him to focus on every ball. Agassi was hitting for an hour or so with the Czech Karel Kucera, and after every rally he was leaving the court to discuss with his coach exactly how he was hitting the ball. Agassi has taken this thoughtfulness into tournaments, too. One of the great pleasures of watching Agassi since his return to form has been to see him slowly unpick an opponent's game, impose himself on a match. A case in point was his defeat of Mark Philipoussis at Wimbledon. The big Australian had brushed aside Tim Henman in the previous round and was one of the tournament favourites, but against Agassi his power was not only neutralised, it was made to look vaguely ridiculous. Agassi threw Philipoussis off his stride to begin with in that match by standing 10 feet behind the baseline to receive the famous scud serve, giving himself time to clip the ball past the Australian as he moved predictably to the net; by the end of the game, though, he was standing right up near the service line, picking up 135 mph serves virtually on the half-volley, as Philipoussis, rattled, tried unsuccessfully to blast the ball through him. </p> <p> It is perhaps no coincidence that having fallen back in love with the game, Agassi has also found love within it. He is not a man who gives up his secrets lightly, though, and when you ask him about Steffi Graf, the eyes immediately warn you off. (To one reporter at the recent Masters tournament ,who asked only if he had talked to Steffi on the phone about his semi-final victory over Marat Safin, he responded by inquiring: 'Are you being serious right now? Do you actually have, like, a journalist license? Are you actually able to write?').</p> <p> Asked whether it has been easier for him to have a relationship with someone who understands as well as he does the pressures, he says curtly: 'I don't think it's necessary for a relationship to have that kind of professional understanding, but I think if you do, it's an incredible asset.' In response to a question as to whether Steffi helps him in preparation for games he observes only that 'I find myself very interested in what she thinks about a lot of things, and that includes tennis'</p> <p> I wonder, finally, if Steffi's decision to quit while still at the peak of the profession will have any influence on his own decision to eventually call it a day? 'No,' he says carefully. 'Every athlete is different. To compare it is to try to write the script before it is written, my career has not been normal, and I'm sure my retirement won't be normal either.'</p> <p> As he prepares for the defence of his Australian Open title later this month, the question of whether he should try to make this his last golden season seems to loom large for Agassi, though he won't acknowledge it directly. His longevity as a tennis player has been brought into sharper focus by a number of things recently; first, there was the retirement last year of Jim Courier. Agassi has been playing Sampras and Chang and Courier for most of his life, and between them for the best part of a decade, Becker apart, they have dominated men's tennis. Courier's going, he says, 'did send signals, though more from an emotional standpoint. You know it gets tougher as you get older, emotionally growing up with a player, and having the same dreams and the same goals and just the same schedules, for that to be over for him, it leaves you feeling somewhat nostalgic, somewhat sad. And it does make me critically aware of my own situation.' </p> <p> That critical awareness has perhaps been further heightened by a promotional campaign from the ATP which has depicted himself and Pete Sampras, surveying the younger talent, and posing the question of succession. 'New balls please', runs the strapline. I wonder if there is any extra motivation, as there always seemed to be for say, Connors, to prove himself against the new kids on the block? </p> <p> Agassi laughs a little. 'I would probably consider it a great success never to be like Jimmy Connors in any respect whatsoever,' he says. 'For me, its nothing to do with younger, for me it's always only about the game inside the lines; when a young guy comes around and he does something differently and you haven't seen it before, you want to adjust and live up to the standard'</p> <p> His generation, as he points out, has set a very difficult standard to follow, but he points to the fact that Gustavo Kuerten and Marat Safin in particular have come through this year, and he 'likes Hewitt's game' and suggests that, despite some anxiety among the powers that be about the absence, in particular, of a young American challenger, there is not a lot to worry about. 'You are talking about a sport that transcends the lines of life. One on one, man to man, you are talking about how what I do affects what you do and how you deal with that. There's something fundamental there. And you are talking about something that people can play for a lifetime. So I'm not worried about tennis though certain things have a look of panic, which is not justified or necessary. The game speaks for itself in a very authentic way.'</p> <p> Is Agassi versus Sampras still, though, the biggest match. 'If we are both playing our best, yes.' Are those the games he most looks forward to? 'Not at the moment,' he says. 'Pete and I have great memories. But when we are not right on our game, then we don't really want to be out there, the matches don't live up to what we are capable of'</p> <p> Great tennis players have always needed great rivals to extend them, and in this sense both Agassi and Sampras seem grateful for the fact that the other has been around at the same time. When Agassi was thinking of quitting the game, Sampras expressed his hope that he would come back to challenge him; when he won the French Open in 1999, he received a telegram from Sampras welcoming him back into the fray. They have, over the years, in many ways moulded each other's character, at least on the court, Agassi believes: 'I think both of us have shaped each other's games a little and frustrated the other. He's been a thorn in my side, certainly, but that's what makes it special'</p> <p> Do they talk much away from the game? Agassi laughs at the idea. 'No, he's a way different cat than I am,' he says. 'I think each of our worst nightmares would certainly be to wake up and be the other one.'</p> <p> When I saw him, Agassi believed that he would be ready again to resume that special relationship at the Australian Open, a belief that was reinforced by his invigorated showing at December's Masters tournament in Lisbon, where he reached the final: 'It's been a while since my mind was in a place where I could take in and use the expectations of the public,' he said. 'It hasn't been about winning and losing over the years as about my desire to keep getting better. There have been times recently on the practice court when I have been very, very happy with my game, but between the practice court and the tournament, it hasn't happened but I know it is only a matter of time.'</p> <p> And when, later, the time comes for him to step away from the game, the only thing he has known, does he think he will know the right moment for that, too? 'I hope so,' he says. 'Certainly I'm more afraid about how it is at the end right now, than what happens after But as soon as I think about how its going to end then I guess it's over. In thinking about the end, the end is already there.' His eyes are flashing at the complexity of this prospect. 'What I hope,' he says, finally, 'is that the fight happens in a way that I am proud of.' In the meantime, you guess, all Andre Agassi really wants to focus his circuitous, exhilarating attention on, is the next ball, and then the one after that.</p>",

It is the presentation of this internal drama, that has, in the past decade or so, made Agassi among the most compelling of all sports stars, an archetypal figure for our neurotic and solipsistic times. No tennis player in that period has seemed so at odds with his gifts, or so questioning of his purpose. Even now, having achieved much of what he set out to achieve, when he talks about tennis it is as if, at times, you are listening to Hamlet quibble with mortality. 'At the end of the day I need to do it or not do it,' Agassi tells me at one point, 'that has always been the question for me. The question of not doing this thing I was kind of born to do has been with me for 15 years It's been hard to ignore it at times. But I've had to think about it and answer it, get on the plane and do it again' As a younger man he seemed sometimes to be losing the battle with this question, intent on squandering his talent, the prodigy who could not grow up. He turned professional in a blaze of hype at 16, but by the age of 21 he seemed already strung out, eating badly, losing games for fun, his ever-changing appearance apparently reflecting his fragile self-esteem: first he shaved his head, then grew a tall mohican, then bleached it, before finally settling on a shaggy shoulder length highlighted perm. At one tournament in Florida, when in his teens, he turned up on court wearing torn-off jeans, lipstick and eyeliner (the black socks and day-Glo shirts came later) . Looking back on that time, he reflects that 'maybe I was rewarded too quickly. I came at a time when tennis needed somebody - when tennis was looking for another American. I had so much notoriety before I had really accomplished great things. For me to be doing Nike commercials and Canon commercials and never winning a Grand Slam - that left me with a bad rap - all image and no substance' The trajectory of Agassi's career to that point seemed like a blueprint for underachieving angst. At times, like many of the tennis stars of his generation, he seemed trapped in his father's dreams rather than his own. Mike Agassi's obsession with his son's success set something of the pattern for the more infamous tennis dads who followed him. Like many of them, he was a first generation immigrant to the States, desperately looking to find a foothold for his family, and tennis seemed like an ideal entr\u00e9e into the American dream. Mike Agassi already knew all about fighting his way to the top: he represented his native Iran as a boxer in the Olympics at 17, and having emigrated to America was Golden Gloves champion of Chicago three years running. On the night he was to turn pro, however, like a character in a Hemingway short story, he escaped from Madison Square Garden through a bathroom window a few minutes before his debut bout was due to start. The next morning, he bought a tennis racket, so the story goes, headed west, and never looked back. Drifting to Las Vegas, he found himself work as a tennis pro and waiter in the casino hotels. He studied everything he could about the game: from laying courts to preparing equipment, and set himself up in business, stringing the rackets of the tennis and entertainment stars who passed through. Most of Mike Agassi's considerable energies however, were directed toward coaching his four children. The three eldest - Rita, Philip and Tammee - were all schooled daily using tennis serving machines that their father had adapted to fire balls at a higher than normal velocity, on the court he had laid himself in their backyard. By the time Andre was born in 1970, Mike Agassi had his methods honed: he taped a racket to his youngest son's hand as soon as he could walk, had him serving over arm on a full-sized court by the time he was two. 'It's easy to tell people to bend their knees and get the racket back, there are 12 or 15 tips that all the pros know,' recalled Mike Agassi of his methods subsequently, 'but there's nobody to teach you how to hit a ball at 125 mph, say, or with no pace at all.' Mike Agassi aimed to teach his son just that, and to set his sights high. When Jimmy Connors was in town, Agassi persuaded him to knock up with his four-year-old genius; Borg hit a few balls with him, too, and smiled, so the legend has it, at the way they were returned with interest. Andre's sisters and brother were also developing into good players (Rita eventually achieved a top 100 ranking on the women's tour) but little Andre seemed something special. By the age of 10 he was winning tournaments in California in the company of a highly charged group of young players that included Jim Courier and Michael Chang and Pete Sampras (he was also praying for rain in the Nevada Desert so he could be allowed to take a day off). By the age of 13, when his father thought he could not teach him any more, he was packed off to Nick Bolletieri's tennis boot camp in Florida; three years later he had turned professional; and two years after that he was ranked No 3 in the world, heir apparent as American 'personality' on the circuit to Connors and McEnroe. Something at that time, though, always seemed to be missing from Agassi's game. Though he did well in some tournaments, they were never the tournaments that really mattered, and as his confidence slipped, so did his ranking. (At one point, in those days, Connors remarked of the over-exposed pretender that 'God, in our day at least we used to win') Agassi looked set to be another Carling Bassett or Jennifer Capriati, the driven child star who could not quite hack it with the grown-ups. Looking back he says his mind was never really on the court, at the time - nor his heart. 'I thought I could just go out there and hit harder than the other guy.' he says. 'Players knew that even when I was playing well, if they could just hang in there long enough I would give the match away' The first turning point for Agassi came at Wimbledon. It was the tournament that he so little expected to win with his game that for the first three years of his career he did not play it at all. In 1992, though, through sheer force of will, he overcame Goran Ivanisevic who, during the tournament, had broken all serving records - and opened a debate as to whether there should be changes in the law to preserve the game as a spectacle. Ivanisevic produced more than a set's worth of aces in the five-set final, but they were not enough to break Agassi's unexpected resolve. Afterwards, when Agassi smiled paternally down at the trophy in the crook of his arm, it seemed like something more than a coming of age for him. Recalling that moment, he relives its significance. 'Tennis has always been a vehicle for me to challenge myself and look into myself and become more of who it is I want to be,' he explains. 'And that moment was one of the greatest because when I look at it in photographs now, it is for me about so much more than tennis; cradling the trophy was me embracing what was not even a dream, but more fears and doubts and questions about losing three Grand Slam finals, and being told by more than just the media that this was something I couldn't win. That is the kind of moment that makes sport great: it had so much more to it for me than the game of tennis.' If in that moment, Agassi had proved to himself he could 'just do it' - as his sponsor had long been expensively proclaiming - it took a good deal more soul-searching to enable him to repeat the process with any degree of certainty. In the years since Agassi has made himself something of an icon for the self-help industry, a case study for our times. At around the time of his Wimbledon triumph he put himself into therapy, and spent some time with Californian motivational speakers like Anthony Robbins (author of Unlimited Power, creator of 'the new science of personal achievement') . He also immersed himself in a customised new age Christianity. When he was first on the circuit he would study the Bible with Michael Chang on rest days during tournaments. He would talk about his faith, too, with reporters, explain how it had changed his life, but for a while now, he has not felt the need 'to pick up God's slack' in this way. (When I ask him about his religion, he replies only with a caveat: 'I'm not religious, but I have my faith. Religion to me is one guy telling some other guy how and what and when and why. But faith certainly is very important to me.') His friend Barbra Streisand, the high priestess of self-fulfilment, who sometimes jetted in to see his tournaments, once famously called him 'a Zen master'; and certainly, when you ask him, he talks about his tennis as a kind of spiritual journey. In response to an innocuous question about the goals he sets himself in the game these days, for example, he speaks, typically, as if of a pilgrim's progress:'You discover more each day about who it is you want to be,' he suggests, 'and how you want to be, and once you discover it you are only half way there, after that it is about living up to it over and over again and failing at it a number of times' Agassi's failings tended to increase, it seemed, at around the time of his brief, ill-fated marriage to Brooke Shields. He had first got together with Shields in 1993; though initially their relationship, suggested by a mutual friend Lyndie Benson, the wife of saxophonist Kenny G, was conducted through daily faxes - Shields was away on location in Africa - in which each slowly bared their soul. Shields's grandfather had been a US Open finalist, but they shared therapyspeak rather than on-court chemistry; when she returned they talked on the phone every day for six weeks, before they finally met each other at the end of the year. At the time, Agassi told Esquire magazine that he and Shields were made for each other, a pair of damaged souls who could put each other back together: 'We've both gone through the same things,' he said, ever earnest. 'We were both celebrities young. We were both thrown into a strange lifestyle young, and we both got bad raps when we were young, so we have a similar history together. And I think both of us haven't maximised our abilities. But that's changing.' These hopes for his relationship with Shields - that it would resurrect his game - slowly proved unfounded, however; they were married in 1997, by which time Agassi was at his lowest point in tennis terms, rarely playing, and mostly losing when he did. He won't talk in public about that period now, except to say, smiling that, 'with my game, it was not easy for me to drop that far down, to be ranked at 140. I had to put in a great deal of hard work at the buffet table to achieve that, a great deal of work' Oddly, soon after he was married and with his career virtually on hold, Agassi apparently made the decision to finally commit himself to his first love. At 27, when some of his contemporaries were giving up on the game, he set himself the target of fulfilling his dim and distant potential, but this time for himself rather than for anyone else. 'I'm very challenged by it, by this starting over,' he said. 'Sometimes it makes me happy with myself in a calm way, sometimes in a sick, demented way I've played this game for a lot of reasons, and none of them have ever quite been my own, but this time my desire is to get out there and enjoy it' Many sportsmen dream of comebacks, but only the greatest ever achieve them. The defining factor in this rehabilitation perhaps came from another, more straightforward relationship, one that also began in 1993. Brad Gilbert had through the Eighties been the player on tour who had done most to maximise a limited talent. His high school coach had noted of him that he had 'No forehand. No backhand. No volley. Weak serve,' but also that he 'wins matches'. Gilbert delighted in proving that even the best could be beaten by application and mental toughness (at one changeover in the Masters tournament in 1986, John McEnroe told Gilbert: 'You don't deserve to be on the same court as me! You are the worst, the fucking worst!' he went on to lose, and afterwards talked for the first time about retirement.) Gilbert wrote a book about his approach called Winning Ugly; intrigued, and after having been dumped by his long-time coach Bolletieri (who took up with Boris Becker), Agassi asked Gilbert if he could help him out. Gilbert's great strength was that he could not bear to see Agassi (who looked to him 'like a poster boy for the caffeine industry') waste his talent, but he also knew all too well that talent alone did not make a champion. 'Brad could not believe it,' Agassi observes of their differing approaches, 'when I told him that sometimes I'd decide where I was going to hit my serve during the ball toss. For Brad, that was unacceptable because he was the kind of player who would think about where he was going to hit the serve two weeks before the toss' Above all, Gilbert forced Agassi to believe that he could become what he has become. Watching Agassi train with his coach in Lyon, you can see how Gilbert has helped him to focus on every ball. Agassi was hitting for an hour or so with the Czech Karel Kucera, and after every rally he was leaving the court to discuss with his coach exactly how he was hitting the ball. Agassi has taken this thoughtfulness into tournaments, too. One of the great pleasures of watching Agassi since his return to form has been to see him slowly unpick an opponent's game, impose himself on a match. A case in point was his defeat of Mark Philipoussis at Wimbledon. The big Australian had brushed aside Tim Henman in the previous round and was one of the tournament favourites, but against Agassi his power was not only neutralised, it was made to look vaguely ridiculous. Agassi threw Philipoussis off his stride to begin with in that match by standing 10 feet behind the baseline to receive the famous scud serve, giving himself time to clip the ball past the Australian as he moved predictably to the net; by the end of the game, though, he was standing right up near the service line, picking up 135 mph serves virtually on the half-volley, as Philipoussis, rattled, tried unsuccessfully to blast the ball through him. It is perhaps no coincidence that having fallen back in love with the game, Agassi has also found love within it. He is not a man who gives up his secrets lightly, though, and when you ask him about Steffi Graf, the eyes immediately warn you off. (To one reporter at the recent Masters tournament ,who asked only if he had talked to Steffi on the phone about his semi-final victory over Marat Safin, he responded by inquiring: 'Are you being serious right now? Do you actually have, like, a journalist license? Are you actually able to write?'). Asked whether it has been easier for him to have a relationship with someone who understands as well as he does the pressures, he says curtly: 'I don't think it's necessary for a relationship to have that kind of professional understanding, but I think if you do, it's an incredible asset.' In response to a question as to whether Steffi helps him in preparation for games he observes only that 'I find myself very interested in what she thinks about a lot of things, and that includes tennis' I wonder, finally, if Steffi's decision to quit while still at the peak of the profession will have any influence on his own decision to eventually call it a day? 'No,' he says carefully. 'Every athlete is different. To compare it is to try to write the script before it is written, my career has not been normal, and I'm sure my retirement won't be normal either.' As he prepares for the defence of his Australian Open title later this month, the question of whether he should try to make this his last golden season seems to loom large for Agassi, though he won't acknowledge it directly. His longevity as a tennis player has been brought into sharper focus by a number of things recently; first, there was the retirement last year of Jim Courier. Agassi has been playing Sampras and Chang and Courier for most of his life, and between them for the best part of a decade, Becker apart, they have dominated men's tennis. Courier's going, he says, 'did send signals, though more from an emotional standpoint. You know it gets tougher as you get older, emotionally growing up with a player, and having the same dreams and the same goals and just the same schedules, for that to be over for him, it leaves you feeling somewhat nostalgic, somewhat sad. And it does make me critically aware of my own situation.' That critical awareness has perhaps been further heightened by a promotional campaign from the ATP which has depicted himself and Pete Sampras, surveying the younger talent, and posing the question of succession. 'New balls please', runs the strapline. I wonder if there is any extra motivation, as there always seemed to be for say, Connors, to prove himself against the new kids on the block? Agassi laughs a little. 'I would probably consider it a great success never to be like Jimmy Connors in any respect whatsoever,' he says. 'For me, its nothing to do with younger, for me it's always only about the game inside the lines; when a young guy comes around and he does something differently and you haven't seen it before, you want to adjust and live up to the standard' His generation, as he points out, has set a very difficult standard to follow, but he points to the fact that Gustavo Kuerten and Marat Safin in particular have come through this year, and he 'likes Hewitt's game' and suggests that, despite some anxiety among the powers that be about the absence, in particular, of a young American challenger, there is not a lot to worry about. 'You are talking about a sport that transcends the lines of life. One on one, man to man, you are talking about how what I do affects what you do and how you deal with that. There's something fundamental there. And you are talking about something that people can play for a lifetime. So I'm not worried about tennis though certain things have a look of panic, which is not justified or necessary. The game speaks for itself in a very authentic way.' Is Agassi versus Sampras still, though, the biggest match. 'If we are both playing our best, yes.' Are those the games he most looks forward to? 'Not at the moment,' he says. 'Pete and I have great memories. But when we are not right on our game, then we don't really want to be out there, the matches don't live up to what we are capable of' Great tennis players have always needed great rivals to extend them, and in this sense both Agassi and Sampras seem grateful for the fact that the other has been around at the same time. When Agassi was thinking of quitting the game, Sampras expressed his hope that he would come back to challenge him; when he won the French Open in 1999, he received a telegram from Sampras welcoming him back into the fray. They have, over the years, in many ways moulded each other's character, at least on the court, Agassi believes: 'I think both of us have shaped each other's games a little and frustrated the other. He's been a thorn in my side, certainly, but that's what makes it special' Do they talk much away from the game? Agassi laughs at the idea. 'No, he's a way different cat than I am,' he says. 'I think each of our worst nightmares would certainly be to wake up and be the other one.' When I saw him, Agassi believed that he would be ready again to resume that special relationship at the Australian Open, a belief that was reinforced by his invigorated showing at December's Masters tournament in Lisbon, where he reached the final: 'It's been a while since my mind was in a place where I could take in and use the expectations of the public,' he said. 'It hasn't been about winning and losing over the years as about my desire to keep getting better. There have been times recently on the practice court when I have been very, very happy with my game, but between the practice court and the tournament, it hasn't happened but I know it is only a matter of time.' And when, later, the time comes for him to step away from the game, the only thing he has known, does he think he will know the right moment for that, too? 'I hope so,' he says. 'Certainly I'm more afraid about how it is at the end right now, than what happens after But as soon as I think about how its going to end then I guess it's over. In thinking about the end, the end is already there.' His eyes are flashing at the complexity of this prospect. 'What I hope,' he says, finally, 'is that the fight happens in a way that I am proud of.' In the meantime, you guess, all Andre Agassi really wants to focus his circuitous, exhilarating attention on, is the next ball, and then the one after that.",

      "body": "<p>W e are in the middle of Canada's Rocky Mountains, the middle of nowhere in the middle of winter. A tiny film crew is shooting a decisive scene for a Gold Rush western, The Claim, surrounded by snow-covered mountains whose fading imprints in the dusk emphasise our isolation. It is freezing cold. Despite this, Scottish actor Peter Mullan has been gamely 'playing dead' in the snow for six hours. And the gap between acting and reality is getting a wee bit close for comfort. </p> <p>Suddenly Mullan, who is wearing no more than thermals under his costume, his beard flecked with snow, starts to reel about as though drunk. The crew realises something is wrong and helps him to the back of a snowmobile. The actor promptly falls off it, struggling to keep his eyes open. Wes Bentley, the young star of American Beauty, and the Canadian actress Sarah Polley look on, concerned, until the paramedics come to Mullan's aid and whisk him off the mountain to hospital. </p> <p>He is suffering from hypothermia. But Mullan is such a tough customer, and such a 'pro', that no one had the foggiest idea until it was almost too late. </p> <p>It is just two years since Peter Mullan's annus mirabilis, when he scooped the actor's prize in Cannes for his performance as recovering alcoholic Joe Kavanagh in Ken Loach's My Name Is Joe; then in Venice won a clutch of prizes for his directorial debut, Orphans, a night of the soul for a working-class Glasgow family, heart-rending and humorous, and one of the few genuinely original films to come out of Britain for years. Approaching 40, and with a long career in theatre and film, the Glaswegian found himself an overnight sensation, a commendation he still meets with wry amusement. But the acclaim (it doesn't hurt when Martin Scorsese raves about your performance - and signs your Celtic strip) has considerably increased the actor's profile. </p> <p>Between this breakthrough and the shoot of The Claim, Mullan made Ordinary Decent Criminal alongside Kevin Spacey, and gave a blisteringly intense performance as Jean, the faux class-warrior-cum-self-serving-shite of Strindberg's Miss Julie, in the lauded version by Mike Figgis. For the role of The Claim 's prospector, who sells his wife and child for a gold mine, builds a town, then suffers his tragic comeuppance (shades of The Mayor of Casterbridge are no accident), director Michael Winterbottom plucked Mullan from a list that included Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel - an indication of the regard in which he is now held. </p> <p>'To live in that time, that environment you had to be tough; and to run a town you obviously had to have charisma and power, and a certain sort of ruthlessness,' Winterbottom tells me. 'What's great about Peter is that he is tough. At the same time you feel that, inside, there's a huge amount of emotion.' </p> <p>Indeed, in Glaswegian parlance, Mullan is very much the 'big man': loyal, committed, idealistic; and, yes, tough. The morning after his battle with the elements, I walk into the frontier town that Winterbottom has built in the milky lap of Fortress Mountain, near Calgary, to find the actor back on set without fuss or recrimination; greeting me with a familiar, face-creasing smile inside the comparative warmth of what he calls 'the horsebox', the most that actors can expect of a trailer at 7,000ft. </p> <p>'It was minus seven or eight yesterday, which up here isn't that cold,' he recalls in his gruff, unadulterated Glasgow accent. 'But I didnae realise that I was soaking wet. The dampness, that's what did it. I've experienced that before, on another shoot - you feel drunk, then euphoric, then it's dangerous. Apparently another half an hour and I could have fallen into a coma.' </p> <p>It clearly hasn't dented his enthusiasm. But then, two years ago he was unknown outside Scotland; now he has the pivotal role amid an international cast which includes Nastassja Kinski, Milla Jovovich, Polley and Bentley. 'To ride a horse and get to dance with Nastassja Kinski - man, you couldn't ask for anything fucking better,' laughs Mullan with an endearingly bone-dry cackle, before reflecting on the accident. 'This place is beautiful, but there's a cold up here that's deadly. It makes you think about the people who conquered these mountains, from all over Europe. And in terms of pure human achievement you go, \"Wow.\" By the same token, you realise how that frontier mentality can become so incredibly violent. If you've travelled 25,000-odd miles, and it's been life and death all the way, and anyone is between you and a crust of bread, you'll kill them.' </p> <p> Peter Mullan understands something about harsh environments, about hardship, even about violence bred by circumstance. Six months after The Claim has wrapped, we're sitting in Jinty McGinty's, a friendly, brown-panelled Irish pub in Glasgow's fashionable West End. The beard has gone, and with his T-shirt, casual jacket and trousers, and closely cut, greying hair, he could again be the clean-cut Joe Kavanagh of Loach's film. </p> <p>McGinty's happens to be near Mullan's 'wee office', where he writes; but it's a long way from Glasgow's predominantly working-class south side, where he was raised in some poverty, and still lives. 'This isn't my local,' he points out. But it's near enough; he's near enough, to what makes him tick. And before we've even supped from the first of many pints, lit up the first of an inordinate number of cigarettes, Mullan is giving me a history of the Glasgow working class, of the Govan shipyards and the 'napalming' of the Thatcher years; while musing that, 'So many guys I was at school with have now killed themselves. Off the top of my head, I can think of four in the past five years. That's my generation. What happened, I really don't know. Poverty, alcoholism...' </p> <p>He was born in Peterhead, the third-youngest of eight children, but grew up in Cardonald, near the shipyards. His father was a toolmaker and later a lab technician, whose income could hardly cope with such a large clan. Yet one of the most puzzling distinctions of the Mullans was that they lived in a grand house on the opulently named Moss Park Boulevard. </p> <p>'Moss Park Boulevard. It sounds really posh,' he smiles. 'And it was, in a way. I've no idea how my old man got it. The irony was that at school we were always considered well-off, not least because we had too big Grecian pillars outside the door. And two gardens. And a garage. It just so happened we didnae have a car, we didnae have any carpets, we didnae have a television, we didnae have a telephone, we didnae have a washing machine. We had what looked like an upper-middle-class home, but we were dirt poor. As the old phrase goes, it was a coat and no knickers.' </p> <p>His mother told the children to maintain the ruse that they owned rather than rented the house 'as a kind of saving face'. His father, who created the pretence in the first place, was simply a snob. 'I'll give you one classic example of where he was coming from. My eldest brother's name was originally Winston Spencer Churchill Mullan, which my mother, when she went to get the birth certificate, changed to Anthony. And thank the Lord. Let's say my dad wasn't a Marxist.' </p> <p>Sadly, Mullan senior wasn't much of a father, either. 'To be fair to him, I believe that his whole generation were completely screwed. They were war casualties; they came back from the Second World War to no counselling, they were all running around barking mad. I'm convinced they had no clue how to relate to their wives, their kids or themselves. I know virtually no one of my age who can remember a hug, or a smile from their father, or a \"Let's go play football.\"' </p> <p>More than that, Mullan describes a household almost under siege from his alcoholic father's dark personality. 'There are some people who walk into a room and they oxygenate it, by their very being there's fresh air,' he says. 'Then there are those who come in with the smell of death and they suck the life out. He was one of those. I remember the undiluted, black-as-coal bile that used to come out of his mouth.' </p> <p>As Charles Mullan's lung cancer worsened, so the abuse strayed from the psychological to the physical. 'In the later years, when he got drunk on whisky, you didnae wanna know. Eventually our household went completely nuts, because the boys became teenagers and physically strong, and violence became a way of life.' Mullan and his brothers hit back. 'We had no choice. I think it's fair to say that if you walk in from school and he's got your mother over the table with a knife at her throat, one's going to get physical.' </p> <p>When he was 14, Mullan recalls, 'I completely lost it. It was a ludicrous thing to do. I made him a cup of tea and I filled it with all these sleeping pills that I found. And I went in - I'd never made him a cup of tea - and I gave him it, and he just looked up and smiled. Obviously he didnae drink it. That's how sick the sickness had grown. The fact that not only did he know what I was trying to do, but he found it dryly amusing, is heartbreaking - both on his part and mine. If my son ever thought of trying to kill me, I don't know how I could cope with it, the fact that I'd alienated him to that degree. But I'd had enough of what I was seeing around me.' </p> <p>In the same period as this incident, Mullan was a member of knife-carrying Glasgow street gang the Young Car-Ds; hanging around, fighting with other gangs, chasing girls, getting drunk. Despite being a bright, bookwormy boy, he was truant from school for the entire year of his gang career. He recognises this now as a crossroads in his life, from which his fellow Car-Ds inadvertently helped him find the right path. 'They eventually asked me to leave, for two reasons: one, they always felt I was slumming it - because I would use words like \"flabbergasted\".' He grins, remembering the embarrassment. 'And also because I wanted to up the ante, I wanted us to do really crazy things.' For a change, he won't elaborate. 'Quite rightly they said no. They saved my life, no doubt about it.' </p> <p>Mullan drags the last remnant of his cigarette and goes to the bar for another round. I'm already feeling drunk, as much on the talk as the beer. I remember that in Canada Wes Bentley, a sensitive, Juilliard-trained American half Mullan's age, but deeply impressed by him, observed how 'Peter is a storyteller. Whether we're sitting in a pub or on set, he's always got an amazing story; and if it's not a story, he's telling you how he feels in a story-like manner. It's very intriguing, you have no choice but to listen.' </p> <p>There's more to it than that, of course, implied when Mullan says he forgives his father, but has 'a duty not to forget'. These are cautionary tales he tells. </p> <p>The same disarming frankness exists in his acting. Ken Loach, whom the actor reveres, once told me: 'We saw lots of other people for Joe Kavanagh, but nobody had what Peter had. I think he's very true, he doesn't hide, he doesn't have those actors' tricks. There's a sense of danger about him which Joe needed. I mean, Joe knows he has been violent and he's sort of carrying that fear in his head, that he will be violent again. And I think you have a sense - not that Peter's violent at all - that there is, when he's working, a kind of coiled spring.' </p> <p> His father died the day Mullan started at university. 'I was ironing a shirt. He was on the settee, been in a coma for two days. Then he stopped breathing and the sun came through the window, literally. I went over, checked, kissed him, was amazed that he got cold so quick, and called my mother. Then I put on my shirt and went to university. Never told a soul. Knew if I told anybody they would wannae go \"Ahhh,\" and I didnae feel \"Ahhh.\" I went out for a dance that night. It was like, 'Life begins now.' </p> <p>Armed with five grade As in his highers and a place studying economic history and drama at Glasgow University, Mullan was the first in his family ever to go on to higher education. Not that it was going to be plain sailing into the middle-class sunset. The very fact of Mullan's success at university - in his second year he won both his class prizes - started, he says, to 'destabilise' him. He hadn't been programmed, either by his background or his father, for achievement. And in the middle of his finals - working a regime of 15-hour days, seven days a week - he suffered a nervous breakdown. </p> <p>Mullan has spoken before of how he was working at home when suddenly he lost all concentration, started crying and couldn't stop. He was in hospital for a week. He talks now, shouting to be heard above the hen party standing beside our table, of becoming phobic, having panic attacks. 'I just put a ridiculous pressure on myself,' he recalls. 'I was terrified of failure, and paralysed by the idea of success. It had a lot to do with class, I think, with deep-rooted class insecurity. Everyone I met at university was middle class. I thought, \"Who am I to be here?\"' </p> <p>He eventually re-sat and passed his exams. And in between the breakdown and graduation, he started acting at university. He doesn't remember why, other than being attracted to the company of thespians. Mullan refers often to actors, writers, directors as 'bohemians' and it's evident that to him such people offered a significant nonconformist escape route from the environment he knew. 'There's a part of bohemia I love,' he says. 'The lack of prejudice, the lack of aggression, I love the lack, for the most part, of competitiveness. It's more peaceful.' </p> <p>For seven years after he left university Mullan combined teaching drama in the community - in borstals, prisons, community centres and, for two years, at the university itself - with performing. This was the heyday of left-wing theatre companies such as 7:84 and Wildcat. And Mullan helped set up guerrilla troupes with names like First Offence and Redheads, touring western Scotland with overtly political plays influenced by the likes of Brecht, Howard Barker and Dario Fo. Thatcherism, the miners' strike, the National Front, were typical subjects - 'anything that related to what I felt to be true about the working class'. </p> <p>He knew he was a Marxist by the time he was 15, despite his Catholic background. 'Truth is I don't think God on a daily basis,' he shrugs. 'I think politics, science.' In the 80s he regarded himself as being further to the left than Militant, refusing to join either those rebels or the Labour Party itself. 'The irony was that Labour very mistakenly sent me a letter throwing me out - when I wasn't actually a fucking member.' </p> <p>As often with Mullan, the anecdotal chuckle is not designed to hide his feelings, in this case a deep-rooted sense of betrayal. 'The people who we [the working class] trusted - the TUC and the Labour Party - sold us out big style, unashamedly so. Everything that the so-called New Labour stands for is beyond contempt - particularly from a Scottish context. They don't understand us, they never will understand us, they don't wannae understand us. These people, these spin doctors, these careerists... I despise them.' </p> <p>While becoming immersed in political drama, in his mid-twenties, Mullan had two further breakdowns. 'I call them my breakdown years. I would needlessly punish myself - angst, angst, angst. Sometimes over a broken relationship, sometimes because I was 25 and hadn't changed the world. If we've all got pilot lights,' he tries to explain, 'mine has always been a bit high, I don't know how to turn it off, or to bring it down - although,' he smiles, 'I don't think by any means that makes me fucking unique.' But then, one day in 1986, 'I was just sitting on a bus and I had this realisation, quite literally, that I would never have another breakdown. I don't know why, but that permanent feeling of dread, that something terrible was going to happen to me, just went.' </p> <p> In 1987, Mullan joined Wildcat for a political pantomime, and so began his professional acting career. The next few years saw more theatre, television (including the obligatory episodes of Taggart) and small parts in significant Scotland-based films such as Braveheart, Shallow Grave and Trainspotting, in the latter giving a memorable cameo as the drug-dealer Mother Superior. There was a supporting role, too, in Loach's Riff-Raff, which in part paved the way for Joe. </p> <p>By this time he was also writing and directing his own fabulous films. Orphans, which was based on his feelings when his mother died, and the three preceeding shorts - Close, Good Day for the Bad Guys and the award-winning Fridge (in which two homeless alcoholics struggle to free a boy trapped in an abandoned refrigerator) - portrayed Glasgow working-class life with a gritty, agonising, bitterly funny insider-realism, mixed with moments of surreal fantasy, that signalled a huge talent. </p> <p> Close and Fridge were shot in the slum tenements where Mullan himself lived in the early 90s - 'because I just didnae have any money'. He, his wife of 12 years - the actor and scriptwriter Annie Swan - and their two children (Mairi, 10, and Paddy, three) now live just 600 yards away, albeit in a nicer tenement flat. I ask him if he couldn't afford anything grander these days. </p> <p>'I can earn a middle-class income,' he says, without offence, 'But every part of my being, now, has been shaped by the 37 years of having virtually no income. We live an almost determinedly frightened working-class lifestyle, in the sense of being frightened of not working. Annie and I got the flat for 55 grand, on a 49-grand mortgage. You're always terrified of going for a bigger house, because you might not work next year, or the year after, or the year after that. </p> <p>'My wife's only two years younger than me,' he continues, 'We have the same background - working class, went to university, became actors. And we've been talking about it a lot recently, how that terror, that insecurity, doesnae leave you. It's in your veins.' </p> <p>Lest one imagines Mullan is being self-indulgent, it's worth noting that despite the rave notices he continues to choose independently spirited, low-budget projects, resisting the temptation simply to cash in. He has recently completed Session 9, a $1m (ie bargain-basement) US horror film, shot by a young director on digital film in 21 days, which he liked because he saw it as 'a lovely little allegory about contemporary America'. And Magdalene, the directorial follow-up to Orphans, which Mullan starts shooting in March, is hardly intended as a blockbuster. Based on the 'Magdalene Asylums' - the Catholic institutions in Ireland where, until the mid-90s, young women deemed 'promiscuous' were incarcerated - Mullan's script promises to be impassioned, even incendiary, certainly not your typical Hollywood fare. </p> <p>The only time he's done anything for the money, he says, was Ordinary Decent Criminal, in which he provided criminally marginalised support to Kevin Spacey's portrayal of Dublin gangster Michael Lynch. 'Tell a lie - I've done a couple of Taggarts for Christmas presents. But then every Scots actor's had to do a couple of Taggarts for Christmas, or a summer holiday. Anyway, I read the script and it was a nothing part. But they offered me \u00a3100,000. I thought, \"Wow, this is so easy.\" They were going to give me more money than I'd earnt in the previous seven years combined. The most I'd earnt before that was Braveheart - I got 15 grand, which upped my accounts that year to 16-and-a-half.' </p> <p>Mullan, now 41, would never betray his class. But, I wonder, already knowing the answer, if he would ever leave Glasgow - for Hollywood, say. 'No one would ever suggest that to me. Jesus, man, I was 37 when I did Orphans and My Name Is Joe . So I'm fine. Honestly. I'm a lot luckier than the younger guys, Ewan [McGregor], Bobby [Carlyle], those guys. They probably get that pressure, \"Go on, you can make it into the big-big-big time.\" No one pushes me in any direction, because they know it's pointless. </p> <p>'What I do tend to get,' he adds with a grin, 'The biggest pressure, is ma mates, really close mates who you would trust with your life. But if I said to them, \"They want me to be the next Batman ,\" which I'd absoloootely hate, they'd go, \"Oh man, you've gotta do it, you've gotta do it.\" Because they want to go to the pictures and say, 'That's my fucking buddie up there!'\"</p> <p>\u0095 The Claim is released nationwide on 2 February</p>",

      "bodyText": "W e are in the middle of Canada's Rocky Mountains, the middle of nowhere in the middle of winter. A tiny film crew is shooting a decisive scene for a Gold Rush western, The Claim, surrounded by snow-covered mountains whose fading imprints in the dusk emphasise our isolation. It is freezing cold. Despite this, Scottish actor Peter Mullan has been gamely 'playing dead' in the snow for six hours. And the gap between acting and reality is getting a wee bit close for comfort. Suddenly Mullan, who is wearing no more than thermals under his costume, his beard flecked with snow, starts to reel about as though drunk. The crew realises something is wrong and helps him to the back of a snowmobile. The actor promptly falls off it, struggling to keep his eyes open. Wes Bentley, the young star of American Beauty, and the Canadian actress Sarah Polley look on, concerned, until the paramedics come to Mullan's aid and whisk him off the mountain to hospital. He is suffering from hypothermia. But Mullan is such a tough customer, and such a 'pro', that no one had the foggiest idea until it was almost too late. It is just two years since Peter Mullan's annus mirabilis, when he scooped the actor's prize in Cannes for his performance as recovering alcoholic Joe Kavanagh in Ken Loach's My Name Is Joe; then in Venice won a clutch of prizes for his directorial debut, Orphans, a night of the soul for a working-class Glasgow family, heart-rending and humorous, and one of the few genuinely original films to come out of Britain for years. Approaching 40, and with a long career in theatre and film, the Glaswegian found himself an overnight sensation, a commendation he still meets with wry amusement. But the acclaim (it doesn't hurt when Martin Scorsese raves about your performance - and signs your Celtic strip) has considerably increased the actor's profile. Between this breakthrough and the shoot of The Claim, Mullan made Ordinary Decent Criminal alongside Kevin Spacey, and gave a blisteringly intense performance as Jean, the faux class-warrior-cum-self-serving-shite of Strindberg's Miss Julie, in the lauded version by Mike Figgis. For the role of The Claim 's prospector, who sells his wife and child for a gold mine, builds a town, then suffers his tragic comeuppance (shades of The Mayor of Casterbridge are no accident), director Michael Winterbottom plucked Mullan from a list that included Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel - an indication of the regard in which he is now held. 'To live in that time, that environment you had to be tough; and to run a town you obviously had to have charisma and power, and a certain sort of ruthlessness,' Winterbottom tells me. 'What's great about Peter is that he is tough. At the same time you feel that, inside, there's a huge amount of emotion.' Indeed, in Glaswegian parlance, Mullan is very much the 'big man': loyal, committed, idealistic; and, yes, tough. The morning after his battle with the elements, I walk into the frontier town that Winterbottom has built in the milky lap of Fortress Mountain, near Calgary, to find the actor back on set without fuss or recrimination; greeting me with a familiar, face-creasing smile inside the comparative warmth of what he calls 'the horsebox', the most that actors can expect of a trailer at 7,000ft. 'It was minus seven or eight yesterday, which up here isn't that cold,' he recalls in his gruff, unadulterated Glasgow accent. 'But I didnae realise that I was soaking wet. The dampness, that's what did it. I've experienced that before, on another shoot - you feel drunk, then euphoric, then it's dangerous. Apparently another half an hour and I could have fallen into a coma.' It clearly hasn't dented his enthusiasm. But then, two years ago he was unknown outside Scotland; now he has the pivotal role amid an international cast which includes Nastassja Kinski, Milla Jovovich, Polley and Bentley. 'To ride a horse and get to dance with Nastassja Kinski - man, you couldn't ask for anything fucking better,' laughs Mullan with an endearingly bone-dry cackle, before reflecting on the accident. 'This place is beautiful, but there's a cold up here that's deadly. It makes you think about the people who conquered these mountains, from all over Europe. And in terms of pure human achievement you go, \"Wow.\" By the same token, you realise how that frontier mentality can become so incredibly violent. If you've travelled 25,000-odd miles, and it's been life and death all the way, and anyone is between you and a crust of bread, you'll kill them.' Peter Mullan understands something about harsh environments, about hardship, even about violence bred by circumstance. Six months after The Claim has wrapped, we're sitting in Jinty McGinty's, a friendly, brown-panelled Irish pub in Glasgow's fashionable West End. The beard has gone, and with his T-shirt, casual jacket and trousers, and closely cut, greying hair, he could again be the clean-cut Joe Kavanagh of Loach's film. McGinty's happens to be near Mullan's 'wee office', where he writes; but it's a long way from Glasgow's predominantly working-class south side, where he was raised in some poverty, and still lives. 'This isn't my local,' he points out. But it's near enough; he's near enough, to what makes him tick.

'The people who we [the working class] trusted - the TUC and the Labour Party - sold us out big style, unashamedly so. Everything that the so-called New Labour stands for is beyond contempt - particularly from a Scottish context. They don't understand us, they never will understand us, they don't wannae understand us. These people, these spin doctors, these careerists... I despise them.' While becoming immersed in political drama, in his mid-twenties, Mullan had two further breakdowns. 'I call them my breakdown years. I would needlessly punish myself - angst, angst, angst. Sometimes over a broken relationship, sometimes because I was 25 and hadn't changed the world. If we've all got pilot lights,' he tries to explain, 'mine has always been a bit high, I don't know how to turn it off, or to bring it down - although,' he smiles, 'I don't think by any means that makes me fucking unique.' But then, one day in 1986, 'I was just sitting on a bus and I had this realisation, quite literally, that I would never have another breakdown. I don't know why, but that permanent feeling of dread, that something terrible was going to happen to me, just went.' In 1987, Mullan joined Wildcat for a political pantomime, and so began his professional acting career. The next few years saw more theatre, television (including the obligatory episodes of Taggart) and small parts in significant Scotland-based films such as Braveheart, Shallow Grave and Trainspotting, in the latter giving a memorable cameo as the drug-dealer Mother Superior. There was a supporting role, too, in Loach's Riff-Raff, which in part paved the way for Joe. By this time he was also writing and directing his own fabulous films. Orphans, which was based on his feelings when his mother died, and the three preceeding shorts - Close, Good Day for the Bad Guys and the award-winning Fridge (in which two homeless alcoholics struggle to free a boy trapped in an abandoned refrigerator) - portrayed Glasgow working-class life with a gritty, agonising, bitterly funny insider-realism, mixed with moments of surreal fantasy, that signalled a huge talent. Close and Fridge were shot in the slum tenements where Mullan himself lived in the early 90s - 'because I just didnae have any money'. He, his wife of 12 years - the actor and scriptwriter Annie Swan - and their two children (Mairi, 10, and Paddy, three) now live just 600 yards away, albeit in a nicer tenement flat. I ask him if he couldn't afford anything grander these days. 'I can earn a middle-class income,' he says, without offence, 'But every part of my being, now, has been shaped by the 37 years of having virtually no income. We live an almost determinedly frightened working-class lifestyle, in the sense of being frightened of not working. Annie and I got the flat for 55 grand, on a 49-grand mortgage. You're always terrified of going for a bigger house, because you might not work next year, or the year after, or the year after that. 'My wife's only two years younger than me,' he continues, 'We have the same background - working class, went to university, became actors. And we've been talking about it a lot recently, how that terror, that insecurity, doesnae leave you. It's in your veins.' Lest one imagines Mullan is being self-indulgent, it's worth noting that despite the rave notices he continues to choose independently spirited, low-budget projects, resisting the temptation simply to cash in. He has recently completed Session 9, a $1m (ie bargain-basement) US horror film, shot by a young director on digital film in 21 days, which he liked because he saw it as 'a lovely little allegory about contemporary America'. And Magdalene, the directorial follow-up to Orphans, which Mullan starts shooting in March, is hardly intended as a blockbuster. Based on the 'Magdalene Asylums' - the Catholic institutions in Ireland where, until the mid-90s, young women deemed 'promiscuous' were incarcerated - Mullan's script promises to be impassioned, even incendiary, certainly not your typical Hollywood fare. The only time he's done anything for the money, he says, was Ordinary Decent Criminal, in which he provided criminally marginalised support to Kevin Spacey's portrayal of Dublin gangster Michael Lynch. 'Tell a lie - I've done a couple of Taggarts for Christmas presents. But then every Scots actor's had to do a couple of Taggarts for Christmas, or a summer holiday. Anyway, I read the script and it was a nothing part. But they offered me \u00a3100,000. I thought, \"Wow, this is so easy.\" They were going to give me more money than I'd earnt in the previous seven years combined. The most I'd earnt before that was Braveheart - I got 15 grand, which upped my accounts that year to 16-and-a-half.' Mullan, now 41, would never betray his class. But, I wonder, already knowing the answer, if he would ever leave Glasgow - for Hollywood, say. 'No one would ever suggest that to me. Jesus, man, I was 37 when I did Orphans and My Name Is Joe . So I'm fine. Honestly. I'm a lot luckier than the younger guys, Ewan [McGregor], Bobby [Carlyle], those guys. They probably get that pressure, \"Go on, you can make it into the big-big-big time.\" No one pushes me in any direction, because they know it's pointless. 'What I do tend to get,' he adds with a grin, 'The biggest pressure, is ma mates, really close mates who you would trust with your life. But if I said to them, \"They want me to be the next Batman ,\" which I'd absoloootely hate, they'd go, \"Oh man, you've gotta do it, you've gotta do it.\" Because they want to go to the pictures and say, 'That's my fucking buddie up there!'\" \u0095 The Claim is released nationwide on 2 February",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Three-and-a-half years ago Eddie Newton was scoring the FA Cup Final winner at Wembley. 'Every man with any interest in football has dreamt about scoring in the Cup Final,' he says. 'Imagine how it felt in that dream and that's how it felt. Everything slows down and it's just quality.' Two-and-a-half years ago he was winning a European Cup Winners Cup medal in Stockholm. This season he has played six games for Barnet (W1, D2, L3) and five for Hayes (W0, D2, L3). 'It's easier to destroy something than to build it up,' he says. 'It took years to build my career at Chelsea, a matter of weeks to end it.' </p> <p>We meet at the somewhat bleak Jarvis International Hotel in west London. Sky Sports 2 is on, muted, in the corner. It is not crowded. There is a man behind the bar. A woman cleans the floor, mopping skilfully around the 'Caution: Slippery When Wet' sign. Given the surroundings and Newton's tale, things could become depressing. It is to his credit that they do not. There is some bafflement but very little bitterness. </p> <p>Let's start with the good times. 'From the age of eight there was never any doubt I'd be a professional footballer unless there was a catastrophic injury or something. My manager [of his school team] knew I was a cut above and took me to Fulham. And then I played schoolboy, district, five-a-side, Sunday, Inner London and Greater London football. There was a time when I was playing 10 games a fortnight. Which was ridiculous. Silly. And I'd always won things all through my life. Then I got to Chelsea and all of a sudden I stopped winning.' It was the era of Ian Porterfield and David Webb and Newton lined up alongside Andy Townsend in a Chelsea side who didn't concern themselves too much with passing. </p> <p>'We were playing back-to-front football, and Andy and I would take it in turns to rush forward and get back again.' </p> <p>Enter Glenn Hoddle. 'Glenn said: \"You've got a bit of everything: you can tackle, win the ball in the air, you've the skill to get yourself out of trouble and you can pass the ball. The perfect position for you is to sit in midfield.\" ' Hoddle turned the club around, Ruud Gullit - 'a very relaxed man' - continued his work and Eddie started winning again. During his career at Chelsea he won four cup medals. As many, if you include the Full Members and the Zenith Data, as the club had won in their history before Newton joined. </p> <p>Then came Vialli. 'Sometimes your face doesn't fit. Whatever you do, it doesn't matter. I'd been through a lot of managers so I suppose it was inevitable that one of them would not like my face. From day one I knew I wouldn't be in his side.' He played for the team only fitfully. 'The 98-99 season I couldn't find my feet. There was a game at Blackburn and Graeme Le Saux was injured in the first five minutes. I played really, really well and I thought: \"Yeah, I'm back. Surely he can't drop me for the next two or three games.\" Next game - straight back on the subs' bench.' </p> <p>Didier Deschamps was signed and Newton knew for certain he wouldn't be playing. He, as the saying goes, issued a come-and-get-me plea and it was eventually answered by Birmingham. 'That was a mistake. When I heard that Trevor Francis was the manager, I thought they would play football because of his background with Nottingham Forest. They wanted someone to play like the old days and I didn't play like that any more. I'd be going back to get the ball off the back four and they would bypass me. It's hard when the ball's going over your head and you just think \"bloody hell\". I struggled for seven months and that was it.' </p> <p>A spell at Oxford United followed, then one at Barnet, and one at Hayes. 'It helped me stay involved. It was a good thing for both Hayes and me. They needed a senior player to bolster the middle of midfield and I needed match fitness. One minute you're an integral part of a cup-winning team and Gullit is telling everybody you should be in the England squad, the next you're travelling with Hayes to play at Dover. And lose 4-1. It's not been easy at all. First of all coming to terms with the fact that you're not at the top any more. You think you can slip into a little bit of a lower club but it just doesn't happen like that. It's been a very big test of my patience and I've gone through all the little character things. </p> <p>'You start off thinking you can sit back and wait for things to happen. Then you go out and try to make things happen. Then that doesn't work and you think what else can I do and you fall down and then you have to pick yourself up. There's a lot of hoping - hoping that something will come along - and worrying will I be disappointed again. I'm getting to the point where I'm not frightened of being disappointed.' </p> <p>His career plans are hampered by three factors, all based on false perception rather than reality. First, he has been stereotyped as a player who can play only the holding role in midfield, but before Hoddle came along he proved to be perfectly adept at playing a more harried, less patient game. Second: 'A lot of people think I'm 33, 34, but I'm 28, turned 29 just the other day. Hello. Wake Up. Because I played for Chelsea since I was 18 and was a fixture for a long while, people think I'm a lot older than I am. David Rocastle had the same scenario when he joined Chelsea and was only 29. Everyone thought he was in his mid-thirties.' And Tony Cascarino? 'Yeah we used to hammer him all the time about his hair dye.' Third, and the example of Rocastle is apposite here, there is a suspicion that injuries may have taken their toll. Eddie says not. 'I'm fit mentally and physically, so that when the phone call comes I'm ready to snap at that opportunity. At Chelsea I was always thrown back into things at the first opportunity and, with hindsight, I was coming back way too soon. But these last two seasons my body has had more than enough time to recover.' </p> <p>So there you have it. A Premiership-standard player is languishing in west London, training on his own, waiting for that call to come. At the start of the interview he doesn't want to discuss his options: 'There's maybes out there but I don't want to say anything in case it goes wrong.' At the end, he says there may be offers from China or America. He would go anywhere to kick-start his career. Yesterday afternoon, however, as Chelsea fans made their way to Stamford Bridge to watch their team defend their trophy, Eddie Newton was going home to play with his son. </p>",

A year ago, he was convicted of murdering 15 women, but it was always thought that the actual number was higher; perhaps as high as 100, it was said, although that seemed far-fetched at the time. So when he was found guilty, there was none of the dramatic relief that is found in other such murder cases. </p> <p>The trial had been long, wretched and baffling, his presence in the dock tetchy and pedantic, and the ending left us with no sense of redemption or of understanding. We did not know how many of his patients he had killed in his 24 years as a GP. We did not know if we would ever know. And we did not know why he had killed any of his mostly elderly victims. It was an ungraspable horror, like a sheer cliff face with no finger holds. Last Friday, a government dossier - product of a year's meticulous research - revealed that Harold Shipman may have killed as many as 265 of his patients. This figure has been arrived at through a clinical audit, comparing the medical records of Shipman with those of his fellow doctors in Manchester and Todmorden, West Yorkshire. His massacre was quiet and methodical. Most of the deaths occurred between noon and three in the afternoon. Assuming that the victims were all injected with diamorphine, they would not even have realised that they were dying. </p> <p>The possibility of a retrial has been pretty much ruled out - it would be impossible to get an objective jury, and many of the relevant documents have been destroyed or lost and many of the witnesses are now dead. Shipman himself, held in solitude at Frankland Prison, near Durham, for his own safety, has not spoken, despite appeals for help. The relatives of the potential victims are left suspended in brutal doubt and agony. For them, the Shipman trial will never be over. They will never know how their loved ones died. </p> <p>This shattering new figure makes Shipman Britain's worst serial killer by far - and perhaps the world's, too (only a Colombian, Pedro Alonso Lopez, may have killed more than him). He left a trail of death behind him. He cut a swathe through the community in which he lived as a revered family doctor. Yet he remains a weirdly unresonant figure, who baffles rather than horrifies us. On Friday morning, some of the newspapers led on the ghastly news; others placed it at the bottom of the page; still others put it in the middle of the paper, under a modestly-sized headline. Big Brother, delayed trains, flooded living-rooms, Madonna's private wedding: these things made as much or more impact than 265 people killed by one respectable man. By Saturday, the enormity of the new evidence had begun to sink in and several newspapers put Shipman on the front page. </p> <p>Nevertheless, his face - clerkish and bespectacled, with a scratchy beard and aggrieved stare - doesn't send a frisson of terror through us, the way that Myra Hindley's obscenely painted face does. He has not become one of our demons, not an icon of evil, and that's because he doesn't hold an evident meaning for us. </p> <p>Why is this? First, and most shamingly, the majority of Harold Shipman's victims and assumed victims were elderly and they were female, which gave them a double invisibility. Everyone's assumption, when Shipman was first arrested, was that he was a mercy-killer, easing sick patients out of a life they'd grown weary of. </p> <p>But even after we knew that this was not the case - that many of them were healthy and happy, liked their life, went out gardening and dancing and courting and visiting, were loved and loving and full of pluck and gaiety and quite unready to die - we were still not gripped by pity for the women he'd killed. They weren't children, sweet innocents slaughtered, nor were they beautiful young women. They weren't the stuff of tragedy for us. We think of life as a line, and the elderly at the end of it, with not much time left and so it didn't matter so very much that time was taken away. The old - even if we are old ourselves - are \"them\", the silent others. We don't care enough. </p> <p>Then, Shipman was like a ghastly bureaucrat, a statistician at work. He injected his patients with a lethal dose of diamorphine as they sat docilely in their chairs, sleeves rolled up, trusting the good doctor. He didn't seem to have any reason at all - the trawl back through his life shows a diligent schoolboy who loved his mother and saw her die of cancer; the fact that he used to watch her being injected with the same pain-killing drugs that he later used to kill his patients is both riveting and unrevealing. </p> <p>His murders were not Gothic and tormented, the stuff of horror stories and dark fairy tales, but mute and with a ghastly decorum. He didn't kidnap them, torture them, sexually abuse them, mutilate them or cut them up. He didn't boil them or bury them vertically in his garden or basement. He never listened to them scream. He simply killed them, one by one, down the years. </p> <p>This means that we cannot identify either with the victims or with the killer. When James Bulger was lured away and killed, there was a mass empathy with the parents. We watched, over and over on the grainy loop of the security video, the toddler being led away, and we put ourselves in their shoes. We imagined it happening to us. We started being over-protective of our own children, gripping them firmly in supermarkets, not letting them out of our sight. The same happened with Sarah Payne. </p> <p>Conversely, when the details emerged of the murders committed by Fred and Rosemary West, there was another - and far more disturbing - imaginative engagement that we had to grapple with. The Wests were murderous sexual sadists, performing unimaginable acts of torture on their young victims. But while there has never been a case quite like it, most of us have some understanding of sex as potentially dark and perverse and scarily powerful. </p> <p>The couple gave us a collective wince of terror, as if their monstrous actions offered a glimpse into a hidden side of our psyche. We called them evil and unnatural to comfort ourselves, because we feared they were human, like us - though it was a humanity taken to extremes and unravelled before our eyes. </p> <p>Harold Shipman does not do this. He offers us no glimpse into ourselves. He will not become a symbol of anything; his story spreads few ripples. His voice is dry, neutral. His face is blank. His eyes are polite and empty. His lips are closed. His heart is a mystery. What does it mean, to be human?</p>",

This is also the season of the health crisis. A year has passed since the NHS reached meltdown.

      "body": "<p>I don't know about you, but I've always fancied appearing on Desert Island Discs. I realise I've got more chance of managing Manchester United or performing a pas de deux with Darcey Bussell, but I can't help it. Like Nick Hornby's alter ego in High Fidelity, I'm an addictive compiler of lists. As well as my desert-island discs, I've assembled my all-time England XI (pre- and post-war), my greatest restaurants, my favourite travel destinations and, of course, my top 10 most disastrous relationships. </p> <p>Given the way I earn a living, it shouldn't surprise you that I make lists with wines. Boringly. Obsessively. Over the years, I've catalogued all my favourites. On the other hand, being a glass half-full kind of guy, I've never spent much time thinking about wines that I hate. But tasting a bottle of dreadful claret last week, I came up with the following list of culprits, all of which deserve to be gnawed by rats in Room 101: </p> <p> <strong> 1 Cult wines</strong> <br>Anything that plays on the fact that it's hard to get hold of. These are invariably a rip-off and were usually not that great in the first place. Screaming Eagle (known as Screaming Ego in my household), Le Pin, Cloudy Bay and Grange are all prime suspects. </p> <p> <strong> 2 Deluxe cuv\u00e9e Champagnes </strong><br> Surely the most over-hyped wines in the world. Favoured by racing drivers, nightclub owners and people with too much chest hair. Cristal, Dom P\u00e9rignon, Clos du Mesnil, La Grande Dame, Cuv\u00e9e Louise Pommery, Belle Epoque, Comtes de Champagne can be wonderful, but are they any better than 1990 Bollinger or Pol? </p> <p> <strong> 3 Dry German Rieslings </strong><br> Wine drinkers in Germany are some of the world's great masochists. How else do you explain their penchant for wines with gum-assaulting levels of acidity? With very few exceptions, German Riesling needs sweetness for balance. If you like dry Rieslings look elsewhere. </p> <p> <strong> 4 Joint-venture wines </strong><br> Two egos are always bigger than one. And they rarely produce superior wines. Anything involving Baron Philippe de Rothschild or Piero Antinori is usually a guarantee of a silly price tag. Opus One, Almaviva, Col Solare and Se\u00f1a all deserve a berth in Room 101. </p> <p> <strong> 5 Almost anything from the Napa Valley </strong><br> Beautiful place, but too often the wines suffer from ludicrous pretensions. There are enough idiots in America (known as 'collectors') to keep the place in business but, a few Cabernets, Pinot Noirs and Chardonnays aside, you'll find more interesting wines in Sonoma, Santa Cruz and Santa Barbara. </p> <p> <strong> 6 French sommeliers </strong><br> Not really a wine, but they still deserve to roast in hell. There are one or two exceptions (G\u00e9rard Basset at the Htel du Vin and Joelle Marti at The Great Eastern Hotel), but they tend to be the sommeliers who have moved to Britain to get away from their compatriots. Pompous, overbearing and, more often than not, ignorant. </p> <p> <strong> 7 Gimmicky wines </strong><br> Anything in a silver, black or frosted bottle is immediately suspect in my view. Ditto anything with a silly name - especially one that tries to disguise its region of origin with an Australian-sounding moniker. Pendulum, Marc Xero, Great with Spam, Superplonk, Scraping the Barrel, Don Coyote, Devil's Rock: away with the lot of you. </p> <p> <strong> 8 Cheap claret </strong><br> I know there are people, some of whom call themselves my friends, who think that drinking red Bordeaux is a civilised pastime. But I'm not one of them. I've had a few great bottles in my life, but they've nearly all been expensive. Under \u00a310, claret is invariably a clunking disappointment: thin, green, weedy, acid and dilute. </p> <p> <strong> 9 Over-packaged wines </strong><br> Designer bottles are a modern curse. There's nothing wrong with making a wine look attractive, but I've sprained my wrist on a couple of heavyweight bottles recently. And I wouldn't mind if the wines they contained deserved the designer treatment. </p> <p> <strong> 10 Wine websites </strong><br> With dot.coms nose-diving all around us, I can't believe there are people out there who want to invest their money in e-commerce. But wine websites are still being launched by the dozen. For every wineplanet, madaboutwine or laithwaites, there are a hundred operations run by saddoes, wideboys and has-beens.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I don't know about you, but I've always fancied appearing on Desert Island Discs. I realise I've got more chance of managing Manchester United or performing a pas de deux with Darcey Bussell, but I can't help it. Like Nick Hornby's alter ego in High Fidelity, I'm an addictive compiler of lists. As well as my desert-island discs, I've assembled my all-time England XI (pre- and post-war), my greatest restaurants, my favourite travel destinations and, of course, my top 10 most disastrous relationships. Given the way I earn a living, it shouldn't surprise you that I make lists with wines. Boringly. Obsessively. Over the years, I've catalogued all my favourites. On the other hand, being a glass half-full kind of guy, I've never spent much time thinking about wines that I hate. But tasting a bottle of dreadful claret last week, I came up with the following list of culprits, all of which deserve to be gnawed by rats in Room 101: 1 Cult wines Anything that plays on the fact that it's hard to get hold of. These are invariably a rip-off and were usually not that great in the first place. Screaming Eagle (known as Screaming Ego in my household), Le Pin, Cloudy Bay and Grange are all prime suspects. 2 Deluxe cuv\u00e9e Champagnes Surely the most over-hyped wines in the world. Favoured by racing drivers, nightclub owners and people with too much chest hair. Cristal, Dom P\u00e9rignon, Clos du Mesnil, La Grande Dame, Cuv\u00e9e Louise Pommery, Belle Epoque, Comtes de Champagne can be wonderful, but are they any better than 1990 Bollinger or Pol? 3 Dry German Rieslings Wine drinkers in Germany are some of the world's great masochists. How else do you explain their penchant for wines with gum-assaulting levels of acidity? With very few exceptions, German Riesling needs sweetness for balance. If you like dry Rieslings look elsewhere. 4 Joint-venture wines Two egos are always bigger than one. And they rarely produce superior wines. Anything involving Baron Philippe de Rothschild or Piero Antinori is usually a guarantee of a silly price tag. Opus One, Almaviva, Col Solare and Se\u00f1a all deserve a berth in Room 101. 5 Almost anything from the Napa Valley Beautiful place, but too often the wines suffer from ludicrous pretensions. There are enough idiots in America (known as 'collectors') to keep the place in business but, a few Cabernets, Pinot Noirs and Chardonnays aside, you'll find more interesting wines in Sonoma, Santa Cruz and Santa Barbara. 6 French sommeliers Not really a wine, but they still deserve to roast in hell. There are one or two exceptions (G\u00e9rard Basset at the Htel du Vin and Joelle Marti at The Great Eastern Hotel), but they tend to be the sommeliers who have moved to Britain to get away from their compatriots. Pompous, overbearing and, more often than not, ignorant. 7 Gimmicky wines Anything in a silver, black or frosted bottle is immediately suspect in my view. Ditto anything with a silly name - especially one that tries to disguise its region of origin with an Australian-sounding moniker. Pendulum, Marc Xero, Great with Spam, Superplonk, Scraping the Barrel, Don Coyote, Devil's Rock: away with the lot of you. 8 Cheap claret I know there are people, some of whom call themselves my friends, who think that drinking red Bordeaux is a civilised pastime. But I'm not one of them. I've had a few great bottles in my life, but they've nearly all been expensive. Under \u00a310, claret is invariably a clunking disappointment: thin, green, weedy, acid and dilute. 9 Over-packaged wines Designer bottles are a modern curse. There's nothing wrong with making a wine look attractive, but I've sprained my wrist on a couple of heavyweight bottles recently. And I wouldn't mind if the wines they contained deserved the designer treatment. 10 Wine websites With dot.coms nose-diving all around us, I can't believe there are people out there who want to invest their money in e-commerce. But wine websites are still being launched by the dozen. For every wineplanet, madaboutwine or laithwaites, there are a hundred operations run by saddoes, wideboys and has-beens.",

      "body": "<p>Food is not for our pleasure alone, but for our good and lasting health. Not purely for the smell of sizzling garlic and butter, or for the touch of a crumb of flaky pastry on moist lips. Neither, apparently, is eating purely for the comforting, velvety feel of warm food in the mouth, or for the quiet satisfaction of twiddling with the stem of your wine glass after a long supper. Food is for our good and lasting health. There, I have said it again. I am not sure whether I have lost the plot or have finally wised up. </p> <p>A whirring, purring, bells-and-whistles electric vegetable juicer sits uncomfortably on a kitchen counter next to a cookie jar. It also provides a challenge - a defining food moment - when you decide whether to scrub half a dozen carrots and four apples or simply to lift the lid on the custard creams. </p> <p>I have been keeping quiet about my juicer, not wanting to be tarred with the narcissistic, 'healthier than thou' image of he-who-juices. 'Food as pleasure' has always been this boy's mantra. How am I suddenly to explain away the chrome-and-white Waring juicer (\u00a3239, and yes, I paid full price) that has been part of my kitchen for almost six months now. </p> <p>Beautiful as it is, I still can't quite bring myself to accept I have bought a machine whose purpose is to reduce a basket of luscious fruit and crunchy vegetables into a liquid form of a multivitamin pill. Sitting there, smugly reminding me that I have finally given in to those who tell us there is more to food than having fun. And believe me, there is no fun in cleaning an electric juicer, even one like mine with disposable paper filters that remove 90 per cent of the hassle. The cheaper extractors are even more of a pain in the sink. </p> <p>I half hoped this American-built, state-of-the-art centrifugal processor might go the way of all expensive toys: I would go at it like a man possessed, then, once the novelty had worn off, it would sit around embarrassing me for months before I finally admitted defeat and hid it at the back of the cupboard. </p> <p>No such luck. The thing is a joy. It has been used virtually every day since I splashed out on it, for carrot and grapefruit, celery and apple. It has mashed spinach, watercress, pomegranate and mandarin. It has pulped cucumber and fennel, and tomato and carrot. It has even minced a peeled lemon. (Now there's a wake-up call.) </p> <p>I have developed the missionary zeal of the recently converted. The evangelism of the born-again non-smoker has nothing on me and my juicer. If your bell rings on a Sunday morning it may well be me: 'Have you ever thought about letting juice into your life?' </p> <p>Juice makes you feel good. It is a gone-in-a-minute glass of vital, power-packed liquid that will make you feel 20 years younger. That much I promise you. The vitamin content of juice is quickly assimilated by the body, which is no doubt why I feel so damned good after a glass of carrot and orange juice first thing in the morning. The beneficial effect of crushed berries or vegetables is felt within minutes. Just as quick as the pick-me-up effect of an espresso. Not, I hasten to add, that all the juice in the world would ever get me to give up my minute cup of frothy black rocket fuel. </p> <p>But there have been some spectacular mistakes. It never occurred to me that watercress would be twice as bitter once it lost its fibre. It took me hours to get my taste buds back. The same with pomegranates. The first sip is pleasing, so you tip it back with gusto and find your mouth goes numb. An old-fashioned citrus press is best for such difficult fruits, where the sweet nuggets are entwined with a sour membrane. My experience with neat beetroot juice in quantity should probably be filed under 'too much information', but I shall simply warn you that your last gulp of juice will not be the last time you see its stunning magenta colour. </p> <p>Some fruits and vegetables work better than others. Oranges and watermelon must be peeled, which is a drag, but apples and pears don't. You get masses of juice from a kiwi, but it is thin and somehow pointless, yet peeled pink grapefruits produce vast quantities of life-enhancing pinky yellow nectar. You will get little from a head of broccoli, despite the fact it may well cure every disease known to man, though cucumber is deeply refreshing with ice and mint. A huge, thorny pineapple doesn't go far, but what little juice you get is so glorious it doesn't seem to matter that you have just spent \u00a32.35 on a shot of syrup. </p> <p>While the yellow and orange juices rush down without touching the sides, the dark green juices are more of a challenge. Anything with watercress, kale or broccoli in it will fizz in its glass like something from the Addams Family Cookbook. Green froth is an acquired taste. I will, finally, accept that food is about more than just having a good time, but I must be allowed to draw the line somewhere. And believe me, that line ends with a glass of fluorescent green froth. </p> <p><strong> Celery, apple and watercress</strong></p> <p>Sometimes I want to start the day with a juice that is mild and slightly sweet. The sweetness will depend on the variety of apples - Cox's, Gala and Spartan are particularly so. Add as much watercress as you like, but I find half a bunch is enough; more than that, and the drink will be too bitter and the colour slightly sinister. Makes 2 medium-sized glasses of pale, sweet juice - but it is an easy-drinking juice, so one could happily get through the lot. </p> <p><strong> 2 large stalks celery </strong> <br> <strong> about 6 bushy stems of watercress </strong> <br> <strong> 3 medium-sized sweet apples </strong></p> <p>Wash the celery in cold water and trim the cut ends. Rinse the apples and twist off their stalks, but don't bother to peel or core, simply cut each fruit into wedges small enough to fit into the juicer. Wash the watercress in cold running water, scrupulously discarding any tired leaves (even one yellow leaf will taint your juice). Shove the celery, apple and watercress through the juicer, pushing the soft leaves through with the crisp stalks of the celery. </p> <p><strong> Carrot and pink grapefruit </strong></p> <p>I know, two squeezers - hand and electric - to clean, but this is one of the most invigorating juices of all time and is worth the washing up. The naughty tartness of the grapefruit cuts the sweet earthiness of the carrots like a knife, and the colour is stunning, like a blazing Greek sunset. A quintessential morning juice. Makes 2 medium-sized glasses. </p> <p><strong> 5 medium carrots </strong> <br> <strong> 2 pink grapefruit </strong></p> <p>Scrub the carrots and cut off their green tops. Slice the grapefruit in half and squeeze them using a juice press. (Or push them, peeled, through the juicer.) Pour the juice into a large glass and place it under the juice processor spout. Ease the carrots through, allowing the carrot juice to fall into the grapefruit, which will prevent the carrot juice discolouring. </p> <p><strong> Pineapple, orange and mint</strong></p> <p>It is hard, looking at your glowing, amber-skinned pineapple, to imagine that it will end up as a meagre glass of juice. But this is one of the loveliest of juices and makes me feel about 16 again. Although pineapples are, relatively, cheaper than they used to be, this is an extravagant juice, one for a Sunday morning. Makes 2 medium-sized glasses. </p> <p><strong> 1 large ripe pineapple </strong> <br> <strong> 2 medium-sized oranges </strong> <br> <strong> 6 mint leaves </strong> </p> <p>Peel the pineapple and cut the flesh into chunks, just small enough to slide down the juicer's funnel, then peel the oranges. I find this easiest with a small serrated knife. Toss the oranges, pineapple and mint leaves together and push through the juicer. The way to get the most juice from your pineapple is to let the machine continue for some time after all the fruit has been pushed through, till every drop has been squeezed into your glass. </p> <p><strong> Carrot, watercress and cabbage</strong><br> </p> <p>Brace yourself. This is not a pretty sight, being a murky mixture of orange and green and slightly frothy. But what you end up with is a gently flavoured juice that is surprisingly creamy and sweet. You can feel the antioxidants positively spurting through your body. Makes 2 small glasses. </p> <p><strong> 5 small- to medium-sized carrots </strong> <br> <strong> the leaves from 6 bushy stems of watercress </strong> <br> <strong> 3 bushy stems of parsley </strong> <br> <strong> 3 leaves of dark green cabbage or kale </strong> </p> <p>Wash all the ingredients thoroughly. Scrub the carrots, then push them through the machine with the watercress leaves, the parsley and its stalks and the cabbage or kale. Drink immediately. </p> <p><strong> Pear and blueberry</strong><br> </p> <p>An elegant juice for when you have a surfeit of pears and have found, as I did last week, cheap blueberries in the supermarket. Makes 2 small glasses. </p> <p><strong> 4 large pears </strong> <br> <strong> 250g blueberries </strong></p> <p>Remove the stalks from the pears, but neither peel nor core them. Rinse the blueberries, then push all through the juicer. You will end up with what appears to be a disappointing amount of juice of a pale-rose hue, but it will have a most elegant flavour. The sort of juice I would be tempted to put in a lace-etched Moroccan tea glass.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The brave minds that formulated the government's white paper on reforms to the Mental Health Act, published last month, could have done a lot worse than consult a young woman called Emma Harding when they were shaping their grand vision. Ms Harding could have given them a stark and disturbing insight into what their plans might really mean. But in the world of policy and principle people like Ms Harding rarely are consulted. Too much raw human experience, the stuff of which nightmares are made, can get in the way of a good, headline-grabbing ministerial announcement. </p> <p>Ms Harding is a project worker in the mental health field, a job for which she is well qualified. As well as being trained in psychology she was diagnosed five years ago with schizophrenia. She was placed on a course of medication that had a pretty immediate effect: her blood pressure plummeted like a stone. \"I kept fainting a lot and waking up on the floor wondering how I'd got there,\" she says now. She was moved on to another drug but it too had vicious side effects. She developed pronounced muscle spasms and twitches in her hands and, most worryingly, a condition called oculogyric crisis in which the eye balls roll up involuntarily into the head. \"I ended up looking like a zombie and not wanting to socialise with anybody,\" she says. </p> <p>And so to a third drug and a third set of side effects: twitching legs and feet, sudden memory loss, restlessness leading to anxiety - a combination that almost lost Ms Harding her job. Unsurprisingly, she stopped taking the drugs which, though detrimental in other ways, had controlled the symptoms of her schizophrenia. Now they came roaring back. \"One evening I found myself talking to my laundry basket. I was asking it what it had done with all my friends.\" She swiftly hospitalised herself. </p> <p>Many people with schizophrenia will find Ms Harding's story horribly familiar. She had experienced the terrible side effects - some of which, like Parkinsonian shakes and tremors, can be permanent - of a group of drugs known as typical antipsychotics. Happily there are alternatives, a relatively new group of drugs called atypical antipsychotics which have fewer and less severe side effects. Ms Harding's schizophrenia is now controlled by one of them. </p> <p>But there are many people who, because of plans recently announced by home secretary Jack Straw and secretary of state for health Alan Milburn, will not be as fortunate as Ms Harding. Under the government's new mental health proposals, they will be forced to take the older drugs, regardless of the grim consequences; consequences that many users describe as even worse than the symptoms of schizophrenia itself. </p> <p>When the white paper was published much of the attention was focused on plans for people with untreatable personality disorders to be locked up without trial, a troubling enough move in itself. But the paper also included another proposal: the introduction of compulsory treatment orders under which people with schizophrenia who, for whatever reason, had stopped taking their medication, could be taken to hospital and be forced to take their drugs. </p> <p>The problem is that the only drugs that can be given involuntarily to a subject are those that can be administered by injection or, ideally, by depot, a slow release dose inserted painfully deep into the muscle which can seep into the blood stream for a month or more. And the only drugs available in that form are the old typicals with their vicious side effects. The new drugs can be taken by mouth in tablet or jelly form, but in no other way. Injectable forms are under development but none is even close to being ready for use. </p> <p>Only the woolly-minded would argue that there are no circumstances under which a person with schizophrenia should be forced to take their drugs. While the vast majority of those with the condition, which affects 1% of the population, are going to pose no danger, there will always be a few who, unmedicated, will present some form of risk, if only to themselves. The uncontrollable psychotic, gripped by paranoia, who tries to crash a packed Jumbo jet, may be one such example. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the state should not be administering drugs that damage the health of already vulnerable people. It doesn't need to happen. The current situation has emerged from a complete failure of what Tony Blair trumpeted in the early days as \"joined-up government\". </p> <p>One of the main reasons why people stop taking their medication - the reason why they would need to be the subject of one of the new compulsory treatment orders - is because, like Ms Harding, they can no longer stand the side effects. The solution for most of them is to be switched to the less harmful atypicals. </p> <p>However, the atypicals are much more expensive than the typicals and, like so many other drugs with a large price tag attached, have been the subject of 'postcode prescribing'. Their availability is dependent purely on the attitude of whichever health authority the patient happens to find themselves under. One survey of Britain's psychiatrists found that more than 50 per cent of them were continuing to prescribe the older toxic drugs for financial reasons. </p> <p>There is no doubt that the atypicals are costly: they account for 16 per cent of schizophrenia prescriptions but 76 per cent of the overall drug costs. But that is to look at the cost of the care of schizophrenia in only the narrowest sense. It takes a far greater proportion of the health and welfare budget to care for someone who refuses to take their medication because of the side effects, if they end up unable to work and needing the attentions of more doctors, more nurses and more social workers. </p> <p>This is a job for the National Institute of Clinical Excellence, which was set up specifically, to look at issues like this. But it was only announced that it would be looking at these groups of drugs as the mental health White Paper was published. The logical way forward would have been for NICE to issue a 'guidance' giving the green light for mass prescribing of atypicals before the Government introduced its heavy-handed proposals for dealing with those with acute mental problems. </p> <p>However, NICE will not report until the end of this year, by which time the Government's proposals will already be working their way towards becoming law. </p> <p>Many working in mental health are concerned that NICE will ignore the side-effects issue and fail to find in favour of the atypicals. A survey published last month by the National Schizophrenia Fellowship found that more than 60 per cent of those with the illness had never been offered an alternative drug.

      "bodyText": "The brave minds that formulated the government's white paper on reforms to the Mental Health Act, published last month, could have done a lot worse than consult a young woman called Emma Harding when they were shaping their grand vision. Ms Harding could have given them a stark and disturbing insight into what their plans might really mean. But in the world of policy and principle people like Ms Harding rarely are consulted. Too much raw human experience, the stuff of which nightmares are made, can get in the way of a good, headline-grabbing ministerial announcement. Ms Harding is a project worker in the mental health field, a job for which she is well qualified. As well as being trained in psychology she was diagnosed five years ago with schizophrenia. She was placed on a course of medication that had a pretty immediate effect: her blood pressure plummeted like a stone. \"I kept fainting a lot and waking up on the floor wondering how I'd got there,\" she says now. She was moved on to another drug but it too had vicious side effects. She developed pronounced muscle spasms and twitches in her hands and, most worryingly, a condition called oculogyric crisis in which the eye balls roll up involuntarily into the head. \"I ended up looking like a zombie and not wanting to socialise with anybody,\" she says. And so to a third drug and a third set of side effects: twitching legs and feet, sudden memory loss, restlessness leading to anxiety - a combination that almost lost Ms Harding her job. Unsurprisingly, she stopped taking the drugs which, though detrimental in other ways, had controlled the symptoms of her schizophrenia. Now they came roaring back. \"One evening I found myself talking to my laundry basket. I was asking it what it had done with all my friends.\" She swiftly hospitalised herself. Many people with schizophrenia will find Ms Harding's story horribly familiar. She had experienced the terrible side effects - some of which, like Parkinsonian shakes and tremors, can be permanent - of a group of drugs known as typical antipsychotics. Happily there are alternatives, a relatively new group of drugs called atypical antipsychotics which have fewer and less severe side effects. Ms Harding's schizophrenia is now controlled by one of them. But there are many people who, because of plans recently announced by home secretary Jack Straw and secretary of state for health Alan Milburn, will not be as fortunate as Ms Harding. Under the government's new mental health proposals, they will be forced to take the older drugs, regardless of the grim consequences; consequences that many users describe as even worse than the symptoms of schizophrenia itself. When the white paper was published much of the attention was focused on plans for people with untreatable personality disorders to be locked up without trial, a troubling enough move in itself. But the paper also included another proposal: the introduction of compulsory treatment orders under which people with schizophrenia who, for whatever reason, had stopped taking their medication, could be taken to hospital and be forced to take their drugs. The problem is that the only drugs that can be given involuntarily to a subject are those that can be administered by injection or, ideally, by depot, a slow release dose inserted painfully deep into the muscle which can seep into the blood stream for a month or more. And the only drugs available in that form are the old typicals with their vicious side effects. The new drugs can be taken by mouth in tablet or jelly form, but in no other way. Injectable forms are under development but none is even close to being ready for use. Only the woolly-minded would argue that there are no circumstances under which a person with schizophrenia should be forced to take their drugs. While the vast majority of those with the condition, which affects 1% of the population, are going to pose no danger, there will always be a few who, unmedicated, will present some form of risk, if only to themselves. The uncontrollable psychotic, gripped by paranoia, who tries to crash a packed Jumbo jet, may be one such example. Nevertheless, the state should not be administering drugs that damage the health of already vulnerable people. It doesn't need to happen. The current situation has emerged from a complete failure of what Tony Blair trumpeted in the early days as \"joined-up government\". One of the main reasons why people stop taking their medication - the reason why they would need to be the subject of one of the new compulsory treatment orders - is because, like Ms Harding, they can no longer stand the side effects. The solution for most of them is to be switched to the less harmful atypicals. However, the atypicals are much more expensive than the typicals and, like so many other drugs with a large price tag attached, have been the subject of 'postcode prescribing'. Their availability is dependent purely on the attitude of whichever health authority the patient happens to find themselves under. One survey of Britain's psychiatrists found that more than 50 per cent of them were continuing to prescribe the older toxic drugs for financial reasons. There is no doubt that the atypicals are costly: they account for 16 per cent of schizophrenia prescriptions but 76 per cent of the overall drug costs. But that is to look at the cost of the care of schizophrenia in only the narrowest sense. It takes a far greater proportion of the health and welfare budget to care for someone who refuses to take their medication because of the side effects, if they end up unable to work and needing the attentions of more doctors, more nurses and more social workers. This is a job for the National Institute of Clinical Excellence, which was set up specifically, to look at issues like this. But it was only announced that it would be looking at these groups of drugs as the mental health White Paper was published. The logical way forward would have been for NICE to issue a 'guidance' giving the green light for mass prescribing of atypicals before the Government introduced its heavy-handed proposals for dealing with those with acute mental problems. However, NICE will not report until the end of this year, by which time the Government's proposals will already be working their way towards becoming law. Many working in mental health are concerned that NICE will ignore the side-effects issue and fail to find in favour of the atypicals. A survey published last month by the National Schizophrenia Fellowship found that more than 60 per cent of those with the illness had never been offered an alternative drug. More than 40 per cent had never received anything in writing about the side effects they might experience. In short, many clinicians seem to be rather poor at listening to the people they are meant to be helping. The Government is in danger of repeating the pattern. Professor Louis Appleby, the National Director of Mental Health, appointed last April, says that neither he nor the Government has anything against atypicals. 'But we do want NICE to look at this question and reach a guidance.' He also says that he is a firm believer in people having a say in their treatment 'and the White Paper serves them better in that respect'. There is no reason to doubt the professor's integrity nor to question the commitment of the Department of Health. The DoH is shortly to launch a major campaign to counter discrimination against mentally ill people. The problem lies with the other signature on the White Paper: that of Home Secretary Jack Straw.

      "body": "<p>I lay in bed this morning - the end of December - with both windows wide open, almost too mild for a cover of any kind and only the sound of the flood lapping against the walls of the house disturbing the dark. It had all the velvet warmth of a July night. It is not just a hard rain that is gonna fall but a warm one as well. </p> <p>I mentioned last week the need to plant trees, shrubs and hedging to counter the effects of global warming. But it makes sense to choose carefully from plants that are going to relish these enforced conditions. The biggest lesson that I have learnt in gardening is not to fight the soil or the climate but to plant intelligently to make the most of them. It is very elementary common sense but it always amazes me how far people will go to buck nature. The clever thing to do is to go with the flow. </p> <p>That doesn't mean that you cannot improve the condition of your soil. Although I said last week that we should all seriously consider giving up regular digging to conserve the carbon in the soil, it is sensible to create the best soil structure that is feasible before establishing a regime that foregoes cultivation. So, heavy clay must have lots of organic matter dug into it, as well as horticultural grit or sharp sand. This will not make the soil different in any real sense or change its wetness, but it will open the soil out and make it easier for roots to work through it and for water to drain. That can make a huge difference to the health and range of what you can grow in the garden. </p> <p>Likewise, very sandy soil needs masses of organic material added to it to beef it up a bit so that water is retained a little longer, giving roots more chance to access it. It will also let more oxygen in because compost will stop the light soil 'slumping' and closing up. Once the best soil structure that your soil can have is established, then an annual layer of compost about 3in deep should be enough to sustain it (as long as you avoid treading on it). </p> <p>This done, you need to choose your plants wisely from those that will thrive in wet - and are adapted to what we have grown to think of as 'our' climate. Any plant that has to cope with waterlogging is adapted to living with a very low level of oxygen. The roots of a normal plant will deteriorate fast if saturated. Anyone who has ever kept a pot plant knows this only too well. It is perfectly possible to drown plants and some are far more sensitive to waterlogging than others. </p> <p>In my own experience, the Mediterranean herbs such as rosemary and thyme are particularly ill-equipped to sit in wet winter ground - even though until a few years ago many people were responding to the fears of global warming by recommending an increase in Mediterranean plants. The first signs of a waterlogged plant will be a yellow or orange tint to the leaves, and the plant will wilt as though suffering from drought. We are all used to bog plants, such as hostas, rheums and ligularias, that have adapted to life on the margins of oxygenation, but woody plants rarely get mentioned in the same bracket. </p> <p>From my own experience in my garden, hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) copes with wet ground very well, making a lusty and healthy hedge even in the very wettest part of our generally very wet garden. I would go so far as to say that hornbeam is only really happy in heavy, wettish ground. Hornbeam is the best of all deciduous garden hedges. It grows fast yet only needs clipping once a year, holds its leaves through winter, is a wonderful windbreak and provides complete privacy in summer. With the climate shifting, I would consider planting hornbeam rather than beech. </p> <p>There isn't really an evergreen hedge that prefers damp conditions. Yew hates sitting in wet and it is always worth putting extra drainage beneath a young yew hedge. Certainly, our young yew plants just recover enough during the summer to cope with the trauma of a wet winter all over again. Although it is easy to think of holly as needing dry soil because of the intense shade it casts creating a very dry area around it, it actually prefers a good water supply. Thuja is not bad - if you like that sort of thing. There are two species that are used for hedging, Thuja occidentalis (the white cedar) and T plicata (Western red cedar). The Western red cedar is a better plant and makes a magnificent tree, but T occidentalis is very good at coping with poor drainage and must be kept moist whatever the soil. It will cope with much colder conditions than its Pacific coast relative, which gets confusing because global warming will, in principle, suit the red cedar. For me the choice is academic - I would plant neither. </p> <p>Around here there is a lot of dogwood (Cornus sanguinea) in the roadside hedgerows. It likes the heavy, wet clay. Dogwood hedges are rarely planted, so are a pretty good indicator of an old hedge ('fourth or fifth species in hedges of Tudor age,' according to Oliver Rackham, which can be translated as one of at least five species of a hedge that is likely to be at least 500 years old). It looks very good, especially in autumn when the leaves turn a deep plum colour. It will not clip into a tight shape but would be a good choice for an informal hedge for wet, although I would choose C alba and enjoy the brightness of its bare winter stems. </p> <p>Lots of us grow dogwood as a shrub and increasingly I like a garden that uses shrubs as an important part of its understorey. Think of a small garden, planted almost entirely with a range of shrubs interplanted with bulbs, annuals, herbaceous plants, climbers and a few standard trees. A carefully contrived wood in fact, which is pretty much what any garden amounts to. Of the shrubs that do best in wet, some of the cut-leaf elders, such as Sambucus racemosa 'Sutherland Gold', are lovely, with intense colouring, especially in spring. All willows do well and can be coppiced hard to control their growth. Bamboos love global warming, but they must have shelter from the wind to be really happy. </p> <p>If you have space to plant trees - and most gardens can take a small tree or two, or three - then alders love the wet. There has been a fungus quietly killing off the common alder ( Alnus glutinosa ) which, in truth, can be a little dull, but the Italian alder ( A cordata ) is a fabulous tree, with practically evergreen leaves. I planted a row of 18in saplings eight years ago and they are now 30ft tall. If you have a big garden with a lake that cries out for adornment, then try a swamp cypress ( Taxodium distichum ). Never having had the necessary lake I have not grown one, but you can see some marvellous specimens at Sheffield Park near Uckfield in East Sussex.</p> <p><strong>My roots: A week in Monty's garden</strong></p> <p>My son Tommy came up with a bright idea the other day while we were putting up tomshed mark 2. Tom's first shed had been the heart, soul and workshop of the domestic Tom. I suspect that, in a very practical and metaphysical way, he gathered it all up and took it about with him when he was not at home, too, and what we were left with, tucked into a corner of the yard, was a chimera, a hologram of the real, internalised thing. </p> <p>However, for his birthday, just before Christmas, he got a bigger shed. This is both a rite of passage thing (he is now 10, after all) and more a space thing. There is all that power equipment to fit in, all these inventions to make (and these things get made, and get made well). But. The first shed was not to be touched. In the end, a position butting on to the potting shed was chosen - it could be reached via the illumination of outside lights (vital), was near power (essential), and largely out of sight (important to some of us).</p> <p>In the process of putting up tomshed mark 2, Tom had an idea.

      "bodyText": "I lay in bed this morning - the end of December - with both windows wide open, almost too mild for a cover of any kind and only the sound of the flood lapping against the walls of the house disturbing the dark. It had all the velvet warmth of a July night. It is not just a hard rain that is gonna fall but a warm one as well. I mentioned last week the need to plant trees, shrubs and hedging to counter the effects of global warming. But it makes sense to choose carefully from plants that are going to relish these enforced conditions. The biggest lesson that I have learnt in gardening is not to fight the soil or the climate but to plant intelligently to make the most of them. It is very elementary common sense but it always amazes me how far people will go to buck nature. The clever thing to do is to go with the flow. That doesn't mean that you cannot improve the condition of your soil. Although I said last week that we should all seriously consider giving up regular digging to conserve the carbon in the soil, it is sensible to create the best soil structure that is feasible before establishing a regime that foregoes cultivation. So, heavy clay must have lots of organic matter dug into it, as well as horticultural grit or sharp sand. This will not make the soil different in any real sense or change its wetness, but it will open the soil out and make it easier for roots to work through it and for water to drain. That can make a huge difference to the health and range of what you can grow in the garden. Likewise, very sandy soil needs masses of organic material added to it to beef it up a bit so that water is retained a little longer, giving roots more chance to access it. It will also let more oxygen in because compost will stop the light soil 'slumping' and closing up. Once the best soil structure that your soil can have is established, then an annual layer of compost about 3in deep should be enough to sustain it (as long as you avoid treading on it). This done, you need to choose your plants wisely from those that will thrive in wet - and are adapted to what we have grown to think of as 'our' climate. Any plant that has to cope with waterlogging is adapted to living with a very low level of oxygen. The roots of a normal plant will deteriorate fast if saturated. Anyone who has ever kept a pot plant knows this only too well. It is perfectly possible to drown plants and some are far more sensitive to waterlogging than others. In my own experience, the Mediterranean herbs such as rosemary and thyme are particularly ill-equipped to sit in wet winter ground - even though until a few years ago many people were responding to the fears of global warming by recommending an increase in Mediterranean plants. The first signs of a waterlogged plant will be a yellow or orange tint to the leaves, and the plant will wilt as though suffering from drought. We are all used to bog plants, such as hostas, rheums and ligularias, that have adapted to life on the margins of oxygenation, but woody plants rarely get mentioned in the same bracket. From my own experience in my garden, hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) copes with wet ground very well, making a lusty and healthy hedge even in the very wettest part of our generally very wet garden. I would go so far as to say that hornbeam is only really happy in heavy, wettish ground. Hornbeam is the best of all deciduous garden hedges. It grows fast yet only needs clipping once a year, holds its leaves through winter, is a wonderful windbreak and provides complete privacy in summer. With the climate shifting, I would consider planting hornbeam rather than beech. There isn't really an evergreen hedge that prefers damp conditions. Yew hates sitting in wet and it is always worth putting extra drainage beneath a young yew hedge. Certainly, our young yew plants just recover enough during the summer to cope with the trauma of a wet winter all over again. Although it is easy to think of holly as needing dry soil because of the intense shade it casts creating a very dry area around it, it actually prefers a good water supply. Thuja is not bad - if you like that sort of thing. There are two species that are used for hedging, Thuja occidentalis (the white cedar) and T plicata (Western red cedar). The Western red cedar is a better plant and makes a magnificent tree, but T occidentalis is very good at coping with poor drainage and must be kept moist whatever the soil. It will cope with much colder conditions than its Pacific coast relative, which gets confusing because global warming will, in principle, suit the red cedar. For me the choice is academic - I would plant neither. Around here there is a lot of dogwood (Cornus sanguinea) in the roadside hedgerows. It likes the heavy, wet clay. Dogwood hedges are rarely planted, so are a pretty good indicator of an old hedge ('fourth or fifth species in hedges of Tudor age,' according to Oliver Rackham, which can be translated as one of at least five species of a hedge that is likely to be at least 500 years old). It looks very good, especially in autumn when the leaves turn a deep plum colour. It will not clip into a tight shape but would be a good choice for an informal hedge for wet, although I would choose C alba and enjoy the brightness of its bare winter stems. Lots of us grow dogwood as a shrub and increasingly I like a garden that uses shrubs as an important part of its understorey. Think of a small garden, planted almost entirely with a range of shrubs interplanted with bulbs, annuals, herbaceous plants, climbers and a few standard trees. A carefully contrived wood in fact, which is pretty much what any garden amounts to. Of the shrubs that do best in wet, some of the cut-leaf elders, such as Sambucus racemosa 'Sutherland Gold', are lovely, with intense colouring, especially in spring. All willows do well and can be coppiced hard to control their growth. Bamboos love global warming, but they must have shelter from the wind to be really happy. If you have space to plant trees - and most gardens can take a small tree or two, or three - then alders love the wet. There has been a fungus quietly killing off the common alder ( Alnus glutinosa ) which, in truth, can be a little dull, but the Italian alder ( A cordata ) is a fabulous tree, with practically evergreen leaves. I planted a row of 18in saplings eight years ago and they are now 30ft tall. If you have a big garden with a lake that cries out for adornment, then try a swamp cypress ( Taxodium distichum ). Never having had the necessary lake I have not grown one, but you can see some marvellous specimens at Sheffield Park near Uckfield in East Sussex. My roots: A week in Monty's garden My son Tommy came up with a bright idea the other day while we were putting up tomshed mark 2. Tom's first shed had been the heart, soul and workshop of the domestic Tom. I suspect that, in a very practical and metaphysical way, he gathered it all up and took it about with him when he was not at home, too, and what we were left with, tucked into a corner of the yard, was a chimera, a hologram of the real, internalised thing. However, for his birthday, just before Christmas, he got a bigger shed. This is both a rite of passage thing (he is now 10, after all) and more a space thing. There is all that power equipment to fit in, all these inventions to make (and these things get made, and get made well). But. The first shed was not to be touched. In the end, a position butting on to the potting shed was chosen - it could be reached via the illumination of outside lights (vital), was near power (essential), and largely out of sight (important to some of us). In the process of putting up tomshed mark 2, Tom had an idea. Why didn't we make the potting shed into the workshop and the workshop into the potting shed? There was, of course, a motive for this - he wanted his shed to butt on to a bigger version of itself rather than a boring potting shed. But it was a very good notion, and I have now been putting the plan into action. My outhouses - potting shed, tool shed and workshop - are an essential part of my garden. The former potting shed was an old stable with a corrugated roof and a sloping floor - good for letting the horse muck drain but bad for standing on while pricking out dozens of plants. The new space is bigger, nicer - brick walls, brick floor and nearer the house. It is further from the greenhouse, but not much, and closer to the house. Moving all the pots, the potting bench and the paraphernalia of potting - bags of compost, leaf mould, sieves, trowels, seeds, labels, dibbers, liquid seaweed, watering can and the wind-up radio - is a wonderful way of setting the garden up for the coming year. It even feels like real gardening. The new potting shed has room to make potting compost with a shovel on the floor - a huge advantage - and the loam, garden compost and sharp sand all get sieved on to the bricks, mixed up and then put into bags. It is a recipe, a formula. It's a game. I'm playing in my shed and Tom is making proper stuff in his. Your roots: Things to plant whatever the weather If you are planting a bare-root tree or shrub into very wet ground, and for some reason it must be done before conditions can get better, put a bag of potting compost around the roots so that it can work in around them all. Otherwise there is a high chance that you will leave gaps which will then fill up with water. Better than using bought compost is your own dried and stored loam, but you have to be very smugly organised for that. Trees for wet conditions Swamp cypress (Taxodium distichum), white cedar (Thuja occidentalis), medlar, ash (Fraxinus), hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), pear and white birch.

      "body": "<p>You are sitting at your desk. Your computer boings and the \"You have New Mail/Open Mail\" icon appears. A friend who works downstairs in your office has sent an email with an attachment and copied it to everyone else who works in your team. Do you stop and think before you open it? </p> <p>You are aware that attachments can be risky but it is from someone you know and everyone else on your desk has got a copy so you click on your inbox and hit Launch. The image downloads from the top down as if it is teasing you, threatening to reveal all and then stopping while your hard disk struggles to keep up with the shapes and colours. </p> <p>The face is familiar. It is Bart Simpson with his trademark yellow spiky hair and toothy grin. So far, so unremarkable. But there's more. There is a cartoon donkey and - oh, how droll - Bart and the beast are doing something that would give Homer and Marge a heart attack. It raises a half-hearted smile. You hit the delete key and think nothing more of it. </p> <p>Looking at pictures of cartoon characters in compromising positions with cartoon farmyard animals may not be the funniest or most original thing to happen in an average working day. Getting sacked for your 30 seconds of animated smut will certainly provoke a serious sense of humour failure. </p> <p>But who would fire someone over such a prank, and how would they know? Your employer, for one. You may not know it, but from the second you log on in the morning to the moment you switch off at night, your boss is looking over your shoulder. If you are reading this article on The Observer website, your IT department will know you are. If you use the email address at the bottom of this article, your boss can read what you write. </p> <p>Every day millions of emails are being intercepted, quarantined, analysed and, if the company e-police do not like what they see, staff are being handed a P45 and a binbag. It happened last week to 10 people who worked at the Royal &amp; Sun Alliance insurance firm in Liverpool. A further 80 have been suspended in the finance and administration departments. </p> <p>Those who lost their jobs were junior clerical staff, but it is not just the vulnerable and low-paid who are being caught out. The Liverpool 10 share their notoriety with four lawyers suspended last month by top City law firm Norton Rose after an email about oral sex circulated around the company before being forwarded to more than 20 million people worldwide. Even the editor of the Mirror, Piers Morgan, has had his inbox examined by his bosses while investigating alleged financial impropriety. </p> <p>In July the Regulation and Investigatory Powers Act was passed. It said employers could read employees' emails, but only with their consent. But in October Department of Trade and Industry guidelines gave employers the right to monitor emails without asking first. With unseemly haste, employers are using the new rules to amend existing employee contracts, inserting new internet and email clauses that state: \"Messages are not the private property of employees and there should be no expectation of privacy in any circumstances,\" or: \"Your employer reserves the right to access and monitor all messages created, sent, received or stored on your employer's systems.\" </p> <p>Some companies are even going so far as to introduce \"Spywear\" technology, which monitors every key stroke and mouse click an employee makes. It enables bosses to trawl through the text of every email sent or received, every web page viewed, looking for large expanses of flesh tones or simply colourful language. Employers can also flip to what is on any employee's screen at any time. </p> <p>Companies insist the crackdown is necessary because staff are wasting time by surfing the internet and sending emails. Without saying where they get their figures, they claim 60% of online shopping and 90% of hits on pornographic sites are in office hours. They also argue that they are responsible for the content of any messages sent out on their networks. Mike Emmott, of the Institute of Personnel and Development, said: \"If people are spending a lot of time at work not working, it is not surprising if managers take action.\" </p> <p>As recently as a year ago it did not seem to matter much what employers looked at. Email and the internet were still in their relative infancy but over the past year there has been an explosion in e-traffic. Telephone companies announced recently that their networks were carrying more data traffic than voice traffic. The desktop telephone is rapidly being replaced by the desktop computer. </p> <p>More than 15 million people have access to the internet and 36% of employees have an email address supplied by their employer. What's more, email has a peculiar power to get us to open up. Cut off from the face-to-face of normal conversation, we are more informal. Helen Petrie, an internet psychologist at Hertfordshire University, says: \"People find email very dis-inhibiting. They bash out a message and send things they would not dream of doing over the phone or in a letter.\" </p> <p>As more of us communicate by email, IT specialists say firms are overreacting and violating employees' legitimate rights to privacy at work. Dr Simon Moores, an internet expert, said: \"The balance is totally in favour of big business. That is wrong. Constant surveillance is sinister and invasive. The world is changing and we need to think hard about employees' rights and privileges in this wired world. We are rapidly becoming the Western world's leading surveillance society.\" </p> <p>Caspar Bowden, of the Foundation for Information Policy Research, added: \"Bullying bosses can intimidate staff and exploit knowledge of their private lives.\" </p> <p>Workplace snooping is not only intrusive, psychologists say, it is bad for business. \"Employees have always chatted in the office,\" says Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology and health at Manchester University. \"It is no surprise they use new technology like the internet and email to do so. Employers might think it is a good idea to try to control it but the evidence shows the more people feel monitored and distrusted, the more productivity declines.\" </p> <p>Employers are winning the battle to control cyberspace but the backlash is growing. Lawyers say the Regulation and Investigatory Powers Act conflicts with the Data Protection Act. It may also be against the spirit of the European Convention on Human Rights, guaranteeing a \"right to privacy\". The law will be tested in a series of industrial tribunals later this year. </p> <p>In the workplace itself, staff are using new technology to beat employers at their own game. Free websites such as Hushmail and Safeweb encrypt email and web surfing. </p> <p>Back in Liverpool, the 10 sacked workers will this week fight to get their jobs back. One told The Observer: \"What the company has done is an absurd overreaction. If we cracked a joke or passed a cartoon picture around, nothing would have happened. People have mortgages and children to think about. Just because it is on email everyone seems to have gone mad.\"</p> <p>Office smut has certainly come a long way from tacky pin-ups of half-naked women and whispered dirty jokes. The battle over who has the right to say what is unsavoury and what is simply harmless banter has only just begun.</p>",

      "bodyText": "You are sitting at your desk. Your computer boings and the \"You have New Mail/Open Mail\" icon appears. A friend who works downstairs in your office has sent an email with an attachment and copied it to everyone else who works in your team. Do you stop and think before you open it? You are aware that attachments can be risky but it is from someone you know and everyone else on your desk has got a copy so you click on your inbox and hit Launch. The image downloads from the top down as if it is teasing you, threatening to reveal all and then stopping while your hard disk struggles to keep up with the shapes and colours. The face is familiar. It is Bart Simpson with his trademark yellow spiky hair and toothy grin. So far, so unremarkable. But there's more. There is a cartoon donkey and - oh, how droll - Bart and the beast are doing something that would give Homer and Marge a heart attack. It raises a half-hearted smile. You hit the delete key and think nothing more of it. Looking at pictures of cartoon characters in compromising positions with cartoon farmyard animals may not be the funniest or most original thing to happen in an average working day. Getting sacked for your 30 seconds of animated smut will certainly provoke a serious sense of humour failure. But who would fire someone over such a prank, and how would they know? Your employer, for one. You may not know it, but from the second you log on in the morning to the moment you switch off at night, your boss is looking over your shoulder. If you are reading this article on The Observer website, your IT department will know you are. If you use the email address at the bottom of this article, your boss can read what you write. Every day millions of emails are being intercepted, quarantined, analysed and, if the company e-police do not like what they see, staff are being handed a P45 and a binbag. It happened last week to 10 people who worked at the Royal &amp; Sun Alliance insurance firm in Liverpool. A further 80 have been suspended in the finance and administration departments. Those who lost their jobs were junior clerical staff, but it is not just the vulnerable and low-paid who are being caught out. The Liverpool 10 share their notoriety with four lawyers suspended last month by top City law firm Norton Rose after an email about oral sex circulated around the company before being forwarded to more than 20 million people worldwide. Even the editor of the Mirror, Piers Morgan, has had his inbox examined by his bosses while investigating alleged financial impropriety. In July the Regulation and Investigatory Powers Act was passed. It said employers could read employees' emails, but only with their consent. But in October Department of Trade and Industry guidelines gave employers the right to monitor emails without asking first. With unseemly haste, employers are using the new rules to amend existing employee contracts, inserting new internet and email clauses that state: \"Messages are not the private property of employees and there should be no expectation of privacy in any circumstances,\" or: \"Your employer reserves the right to access and monitor all messages created, sent, received or stored on your employer's systems.\" Some companies are even going so far as to introduce \"Spywear\" technology, which monitors every key stroke and mouse click an employee makes. It enables bosses to trawl through the text of every email sent or received, every web page viewed, looking for large expanses of flesh tones or simply colourful language. Employers can also flip to what is on any employee's screen at any time. Companies insist the crackdown is necessary because staff are wasting time by surfing the internet and sending emails. Without saying where they get their figures, they claim 60% of online shopping and 90% of hits on pornographic sites are in office hours. They also argue that they are responsible for the content of any messages sent out on their networks. Mike Emmott, of the Institute of Personnel and Development, said: \"If people are spending a lot of time at work not working, it is not surprising if managers take action.\" As recently as a year ago it did not seem to matter much what employers looked at. Email and the internet were still in their relative infancy but over the past year there has been an explosion in e-traffic. Telephone companies announced recently that their networks were carrying more data traffic than voice traffic. The desktop telephone is rapidly being replaced by the desktop computer. More than 15 million people have access to the internet and 36% of employees have an email address supplied by their employer. What's more, email has a peculiar power to get us to open up. Cut off from the face-to-face of normal conversation, we are more informal. Helen Petrie, an internet psychologist at Hertfordshire University, says: \"People find email very dis-inhibiting. They bash out a message and send things they would not dream of doing over the phone or in a letter.\" As more of us communicate by email, IT specialists say firms are overreacting and violating employees' legitimate rights to privacy at work. Dr Simon Moores, an internet expert, said: \"The balance is totally in favour of big business. That is wrong. Constant surveillance is sinister and invasive. The world is changing and we need to think hard about employees' rights and privileges in this wired world. We are rapidly becoming the Western world's leading surveillance society.\" Caspar Bowden, of the Foundation for Information Policy Research, added: \"Bullying bosses can intimidate staff and exploit knowledge of their private lives.\" Workplace snooping is not only intrusive, psychologists say, it is bad for business. \"Employees have always chatted in the office,\" says Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology and health at Manchester University. \"It is no surprise they use new technology like the internet and email to do so. Employers might think it is a good idea to try to control it but the evidence shows the more people feel monitored and distrusted, the more productivity declines.\" Employers are winning the battle to control cyberspace but the backlash is growing. Lawyers say the Regulation and Investigatory Powers Act conflicts with the Data Protection Act. It may also be against the spirit of the European Convention on Human Rights, guaranteeing a \"right to privacy\". The law will be tested in a series of industrial tribunals later this year. In the workplace itself, staff are using new technology to beat employers at their own game. Free websites such as Hushmail and Safeweb encrypt email and web surfing. Back in Liverpool, the 10 sacked workers will this week fight to get their jobs back. One told The Observer: \"What the company has done is an absurd overreaction. If we cracked a joke or passed a cartoon picture around, nothing would have happened. People have mortgages and children to think about. Just because it is on email everyone seems to have gone mad.\" Office smut has certainly come a long way from tacky pin-ups of half-naked women and whispered dirty jokes. The battle over who has the right to say what is unsavoury and what is simply harmless banter has only just begun.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Observer: </strong>What is True History of the Kelly Gang about?</p> <p><strong>Peter Carey: </strong>Ned Kelly was the eldest child of an Irish convict father and a mother whose own family was always wild and sometimes criminal. When Ned's father died, his mother selected a farm under a Lands Act which did for the Kellys what it did for most poor farmers - kept them in continually desperate circumstances. Given the boy's poverty and family connections, it is not surprising that he was first jailed at the age of 15 nor that he soon became the apprentice of a famous bushranger.</p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> What attracted you to his story?</p> <p><strong>PC:</strong> It is easy to look at this boy as a product of his class and circumstances, one more example of what happens when you imagine you can change your penal colony into a decent nation.</p> <p>Yet the story of Ned Kelly, and the reason Australians still respond to him so passionately, is that he was not brutalised or diminished by his circumstances. Rather, he elevated himself, and inspired a particular people with his courage, wit and decency. It did not hurt that it took two years for the forces of the Crown finally to capture him. You rarely lose marks in Australia for outwitting the police. He was proof that our dismal history need not be read pessimistically. As Dame Mabel Brooks later said: 'If a cog had slipped in time, the Kelly boys would have been on Gallipoli, one probably a VC winner.'</p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> Was he always an anti-hero?</p> <p><strong>PC:</strong> When he was hanged, there were great protests and since that time his popularity has only grown. This is, as I continue to tell my American friends, not like Jesse James. If it is like anything, it is like Thomas Jefferson. That is the sort of space Kelly occupies in the national imagination.</p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> What do Australians make of the novel?</p> <p><strong>PC:</strong> When I told Australian friends that I was writing about Kelly, I was often met with a sort of puzzlement. 'Why would you want to do that?' One of my friends, a diplomat, had more than once been embarrassed by Ned Kelly; another insisted that Kelly was a murderous psychopath, and even the admiring majority could not imagine what we didn't already know.</p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> You're not the first to have explored this subject in fiction.</p> <p><strong>PC:</strong> The Kelly story is like a great, dark plain on which, here and there, passionate or violent scenes are played. All around these bright scenes are black seas of unseen incident and unknown feeling. We Australians had not even begun to imagine the emotional life of the characters in our great story.</p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> For example?</p> <p><strong>PC:</strong> One quick example: it is no secret that Ned Kelly's father died when he was 12, that he was the eldest boy, that he took responsibility for his family and became 'the Man'. Ned and his mother were very close all his life, and his actions in his last two years seem largely motivated by his desparation to get her out of jail. Ellen Kelly was a wild woman. She had lovers, husbands, children by numerous fathers. If we only imagine her son as a hero, then we cannot allow him to be jealous of these men. But if we allow ourselves to think of him as a growing boy we can permit him to be human.</p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> How long did you work on it?</p> <p><strong>PC:</strong> True History of the Kelly Gang took about three years to write but it would not be too glib to claim a much longer period, say 35 years.</p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> When did the story first impinge on your consciousness ?</p> <p><strong>PC:</strong> Somewhere in the middle Sixties, I first came upon the 56-page letter which Kelly attempted to have printed when the gang robbed the bank in Jerilderie in 1879. It is an extraordinary document, the passionate voice of a man who is writing to explain his life, save his life, his reputation. He wants us to see the injustice suffered by the poor farmers of North-Eastern Victoria. He does not paint himself lilywhite but he wants us to see how it was three policemen died at Stringybark Creek.</p> <p>The Jerilderie Letter is a howl of pain. It sometimes sounds nuts then its author can also write: 'If my lips taught the public that men are made mad by bad treatment, then my life will not have been thrown away.' And all the time there is this original voice - uneducated but intelligent, funny and then angry, and with a line of Irish invective that would have made Paul Keating envious. His language came in a great, furious rush that could not but remind you of far more literary Irish writers.</p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> How did you approach such a massive and mythic subject?</p> <p><strong>PC:</strong> When the time came for me to write the book, I never doubted how I should begin the job. For it was Kelly's language that drew me to this story. In those eccentric sentences was my character's DNA. I found the letter reproduced but I did not attempt to parody Kelly's style. What I finally wrote grew not just from the Jerilderie Letter but my first 10 years of life which I spent in the very small country town of Bacchus Marsh. I once knew people who spoke more or less like Ned does in my novel. I could inhabit this voice like an old, familiar shoe.</p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> Was there a specific moment of inspiration for the novel?</p> <p><strong>PC:</strong> I've lived in New York for 10 years now and somewhere in the middle of that period the Metropolitan Museum exhibited Sydney Nolan's paintings of Ned Kelly. I'd seen then several time and had always liked them, but in the cab uptown to the exhibition I felt a sudden rush of nervousness.</p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> Why nervousness?</p> <p><strong>PC:</strong> Would they travel well? Would I still like these paintings in New York? What I discovered, in a city where art often seems to be about theory or fashion, were paintings which were beyond fashion, imbued with an apparent awkwardness, artlessness illuminated by enormous grace. I began to take my Manhattan friends to see the show and as I circled the rooms with my victims, telling the story, it struck me what a strange, powerful thing this was.</p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> Has living in New York given you a better perspective on Australia in general and Ned Kelly in particular?</p> <p><strong>PC:</strong> In Sydney, I would have known they were great paintings, and I would have recognised a powerful foundation myth, but I would also have been aware that there was, say, a Ned Kelly Burger and a Ned Kelly Discount Muffler Store and I would know that the main street of Glenrowan, where the gang fought its last stand, is lined with souvenir shops. Absence simplified the story.</p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> How does it feel to have set a book totally in Australia ?</p> <p><strong>PC:</strong> While it's true that neither Jack Maggs nor The Unusual Life of Tristan Smith were set in Australia, they were both about Australia in their different ways. So True History of the Kelly Gang continues that preoccupation, Also, it is set in the past, which is another country again, one none of us can ever return to. That being said, it gave me immense pleasure to take possession of my home again, to see it as strange, new and yet familiar, to draw on something very deep from my place and my experience and write in a language I felt was deeply mine.</p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> You've adopted a 'naive' voice for the book. What were the difficulties you encountered?</p> <p><strong>PC:</strong> There are limitations of thought, knowledge and vocabulary that come with this decision, but they never felt a limitation to me, because I have always had a passion to write like this, to make a sort of poetry from the uneducated voice, to give a speech to the speechless. It was deeply satisfying to me. It was also very pleasing that in the month following publication in Australia, the State Library of Victoria finally purchased the original manuscript of the Jerilderie Letter.</p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> What did you read at school and university?</p> <p><strong>PC:</strong> At school, I was fanatical about being a scientist. I recall reading Voss and not much else. Later, I failed my first year of science and went to work in advertising .</p> <p><strong>Obs:</strong> But no fiction up to that point?</p> <p><strong>PC:</strong> Oddly, this is where I began to receive a literary education. Faulkner's As I Lay Dying had an immense affect on me, and most of my novels bear the burn marks of this experience, those short chapters with their conflicting points of view, truth expressed by multiple perspectives. The other attractive thing about As I Lay Dying was the way it gave rich voices to the poor. When I finished True History of the Kelly Gang, I realised that Faulkner had not lost his power over me.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Peter Carey's many novels include Illywhacker, The Unusual Life of Tristan Smith and Jack Maggs. Oscar and Lucinda (the winner of 1988 Booker Prize) was made into a film starring Cate Blanchett and Ralph Fiennes</p>",

PC: It is easy to look at this boy as a product of his class and circumstances, one more example of what happens when you imagine you can change your penal colony into a decent nation. Yet the story of Ned Kelly, and the reason Australians still respond to him so passionately, is that he was not brutalised or diminished by his circumstances. Rather, he elevated himself, and inspired a particular people with his courage, wit and decency. It did not hurt that it took two years for the forces of the Crown finally to capture him. You rarely lose marks in Australia for outwitting the police. He was proof that our dismal history need not be read pessimistically. As Dame Mabel Brooks later said: 'If a cog had slipped in time, the Kelly boys would have been on Gallipoli, one probably a VC winner.' Obs: Was he always an anti-hero? PC: When he was hanged, there were great protests and since that time his popularity has only grown. This is, as I continue to tell my American friends, not like Jesse James. If it is like anything, it is like Thomas Jefferson. That is the sort of space Kelly occupies in the national imagination. Obs: What do Australians make of the novel? PC: When I told Australian friends that I was writing about Kelly, I was often met with a sort of puzzlement. 'Why would you want to do that?' One of my friends, a diplomat, had more than once been embarrassed by Ned Kelly; another insisted that Kelly was a murderous psychopath, and even the admiring majority could not imagine what we didn't already know. Obs: You're not the first to have explored this subject in fiction. PC: The Kelly story is like a great, dark plain on which, here and there, passionate or violent scenes are played. All around these bright scenes are black seas of unseen incident and unknown feeling. We Australians had not even begun to imagine the emotional life of the characters in our great story. Obs: For example? PC: One quick example: it is no secret that Ned Kelly's father died when he was 12, that he was the eldest boy, that he took responsibility for his family and became 'the Man'. Ned and his mother were very close all his life, and his actions in his last two years seem largely motivated by his desparation to get her out of jail. Ellen Kelly was a wild woman. She had lovers, husbands, children by numerous fathers. If we only imagine her son as a hero, then we cannot allow him to be jealous of these men. But if we allow ourselves to think of him as a growing boy we can permit him to be human. Obs: How long did you work on it? PC: True History of the Kelly Gang took about three years to write but it would not be too glib to claim a much longer period, say 35 years. Obs: When did the story first impinge on your consciousness ? PC: Somewhere in the middle Sixties, I first came upon the 56-page letter which Kelly attempted to have printed when the gang robbed the bank in Jerilderie in 1879. It is an extraordinary document, the passionate voice of a man who is writing to explain his life, save his life, his reputation. He wants us to see the injustice suffered by the poor farmers of North-Eastern Victoria. He does not paint himself lilywhite but he wants us to see how it was three policemen died at Stringybark Creek. The Jerilderie Letter is a howl of pain. It sometimes sounds nuts then its author can also write: 'If my lips taught the public that men are made mad by bad treatment, then my life will not have been thrown away.' And all the time there is this original voice - uneducated but intelligent, funny and then angry, and with a line of Irish invective that would have made Paul Keating envious. His language came in a great, furious rush that could not but remind you of far more literary Irish writers. Obs: How did you approach such a massive and mythic subject? PC: When the time came for me to write the book, I never doubted how I should begin the job. For it was Kelly's language that drew me to this story. In those eccentric sentences was my character's DNA. I found the letter reproduced but I did not attempt to parody Kelly's style. What I finally wrote grew not just from the Jerilderie Letter but my first 10 years of life which I spent in the very small country town of Bacchus Marsh. I once knew people who spoke more or less like Ned does in my novel. I could inhabit this voice like an old, familiar shoe. Obs: Was there a specific moment of inspiration for the novel? PC: I've lived in New York for 10 years now and somewhere in the middle of that period the Metropolitan Museum exhibited Sydney Nolan's paintings of Ned Kelly. I'd seen then several time and had always liked them, but in the cab uptown to the exhibition I felt a sudden rush of nervousness. Obs: Why nervousness? PC: Would they travel well? Would I still like these paintings in New York? What I discovered, in a city where art often seems to be about theory or fashion, were paintings which were beyond fashion, imbued with an apparent awkwardness, artlessness illuminated by enormous grace. I began to take my Manhattan friends to see the show and as I circled the rooms with my victims, telling the story, it struck me what a strange, powerful thing this was. Obs: Has living in New York given you a better perspective on Australia in general and Ned Kelly in particular? PC: In Sydney, I would have known they were great paintings, and I would have recognised a powerful foundation myth, but I would also have been aware that there was, say, a Ned Kelly Burger and a Ned Kelly Discount Muffler Store and I would know that the main street of Glenrowan, where the gang fought its last stand, is lined with souvenir shops. Absence simplified the story. Obs: How does it feel to have set a book totally in Australia ? PC: While it's true that neither Jack Maggs nor The Unusual Life of Tristan Smith were set in Australia, they were both about Australia in their different ways. So True History of the Kelly Gang continues that preoccupation, Also, it is set in the past, which is another country again, one none of us can ever return to. That being said, it gave me immense pleasure to take possession of my home again, to see it as strange, new and yet familiar, to draw on something very deep from my place and my experience and write in a language I felt was deeply mine. Obs: You've adopted a 'naive' voice for the book. What were the difficulties you encountered? PC: There are limitations of thought, knowledge and vocabulary that come with this decision, but they never felt a limitation to me, because I have always had a passion to write like this, to make a sort of poetry from the uneducated voice, to give a speech to the speechless. It was deeply satisfying to me. It was also very pleasing that in the month following publication in Australia, the State Library of Victoria finally purchased the original manuscript of the Jerilderie Letter. Obs: What did you read at school and university? PC: At school, I was fanatical about being a scientist. I recall reading Voss and not much else. Later, I failed my first year of science and went to work in advertising . Obs: But no fiction up to that point? PC: Oddly, this is where I began to receive a literary education. Faulkner's As I Lay Dying had an immense affect on me, and most of my novels bear the burn marks of this experience, those short chapters with their conflicting points of view, truth expressed by multiple perspectives. The other attractive thing about As I Lay Dying was the way it gave rich voices to the poor. When I finished True History of the Kelly Gang, I realised that Faulkner had not lost his power over me. \u00b7 Peter Carey's many novels include Illywhacker, The Unusual Life of Tristan Smith and Jack Maggs. Oscar and Lucinda (the winner of 1988 Booker Prize) was made into a film starring Cate Blanchett and Ralph Fiennes",

But, in its own way, it will be as miraculous as any ultra-sound scan: news from overseas, the face of a child. One woman described the moment of receiving a photograph from the adoption agency as a 'conception', another as 'a birth'. One placed the photograph in every room of her house. Another carried it with her everywhere in the weeks before travelling abroad, like a talisman. She put it like this: 'It is extraordinary how you bond, the difference the photo makes. You know you are going to have a baby. You can see what she is like and start to love her.'</p> <p>But what does it mean to 'have' a baby? Adoption holds up a mirror to birth families: it challenges complacent definitions, shows that no one 'owns' children. In some ways, adoption resembles birth: a blind (or almost blind) date, a lottery of genes. But for adoptive families, the genes are often unknown and the questions sharper: does nature topple nurture? Or is it the other way round? </p> <p>Britain adopts fewer children from overseas than any country in the world. But this may be about to change. Tony Blair's White Paper, Adoption: a new approach, is aimed at adoption within this country but may galvanise 'intercountry' adoption too. The new laws, to be introduced this year, will cut the time taken to adopt a child from three years to 12 months; parents will no longer be turned down for being the wrong colour, sex, size or age. Children will not be left to languish in care when there is a better alternative. And there will, for the first time, be a national register for potential adoptive parents. </p> <p>Intercountry adoption is even more complicated than adopting within this country. Not least because there is colossal prejudice against it. There is widespread distaste at the idea of raising children thousands of miles from home. There are concerns about child-trafficking. There have been troubling reports recently from Guatemala, Vietnam and Cambodia of corrupt lawyers forcing mothers to give up their babies.</p> <p>Britain has historical reasons, too, for unease. It has a past to live down: the shipping of children from British orphanages to the colonies, which started in the Twenties and only ended in the Sixties (the last boatload of 90 children left Southampton for Australia in 1967).</p> <p>And then there is xenophobia. The white mother of four Vietnamese and Chinese children remembers her feelings when a parent at her children's school asked tartly: 'Where did you buy them?' She describes living as an inter-racial, adoptive family in Britain as disagreeably conspicuous, like 'living inside a goldfish bowl'. </p> <p>Sometimes prejudice is more sly, harder to define. It seems to spring out of a we're-all-right-Jack complacency. Many couples who hope to adopt healthy babies (seldom available for adoption in this country) are dismayed to encounter censorious reaction. They are judged selfish for wanting what the rest of the world so easily and thoughtlessly produces.</p> <p>In a perfect world, adoption would not be necessary. But as Liv O'Hanlon of the Adoption Forum and a passionate lobbyist for reform says: 'I simply can't get past the fact that there are children out there who need families.' Hundreds and thousands of children who, for legitimate reasons, cannot find families in their own country.</p> <p>And although intercountry adoption used to be a wild card, under-regulated, and open to abuse, that is about to change. The 1999 Adoption Act (intercountry aspects), is to receive its finishing touches this year when the guidelines and regulations necessary to implement it will be put before the House. It will give intercountry adoption a legal framework for the first time. Britain will ratify the Hague Convention of 1993 for the Protection of Children, which will improve its international status as an adoptive country. Peter Selman, senior lecturer in sociology at Newcastle University, whose compendious anthology on the subject has just been published, believes that intercountry adoption may be about to get the boost it needs.</p> <p>In the Nineties, after the fall of the Ceausescu regime in 1989, there was a rush to adopt from Romanian orphanages. Today, China has replaced Romania (with Russia as a close second) as the main country for overseas adopters. Poverty and the (selectively enforced) one-child-per-family policy are among the reasons for the abandonment of hundreds and thousands of Chinese babies. Most are girls (it is traditionally boys who look after their parents in old age). The Chinese attitude towards intercountry adoption tends to be welcoming and flexible. It includes single women and older parents (the cut off age is 52), as long as they have been approved by a home study.</p> <p>Patti Waldmeir is a 45-year-old American and single parent. She adopted her daughter, Grace Shu Min, six months ago. Grace has just celebrated her first birthday. Patti recognises that 'to take a child out of its culture is a serious matter'. She knows nothing about Grace's birth parents.</p> <p>'Selfishly, it is easier for me that no one is ever going to turn up on my door step. But I hope that Grace will understand that the pressures on her mother may have been extreme, that she will never need to feel that her mother didn't want her - she probably had no choice.'</p> <p>Talking to Patti is a reminder that adoption, although founded in tragedy, can also be a romance, a new version of an old story about the love between a mother and her baby. Patti was told by the adoption agency: 'You have been referred a baby' - a surreal, official phrase for such a moment. And when she saw the photo of the solemn, sweet face for the first time, a 'mugshot against a red background', she 'sobbed for a long time'. Her voice still catches now.</p> <p>After the photograph, 'everything went into high gear'. Over the next six weeks, there was more paperwork and a long wait for the Chinese to send approval for travel. She thought waiting would be hard but it wasn't. There was so much to do. 'You wonder what to take. Which teats? Bottles? Pacifiers? You wonder, will it be cold or warm in the hotel at night?' She took 'baby rice cereal' - and laughs at herself, 'rice to China!' She travelled heavy: there were 10lbs of documents, a buggy, medicines 'because you don't know what shape the baby will be in'. She took nappies, wipes, prunes. She arrived in China on her forty-fifth birthday, which was 'a big milestone'. </p> <p>At the Nanjing hotel where the babies were to be handed over, Patti set up a 'shrine' for the baby: bottles, kettle, Dr Spock. She was too excited to sleep. At three o'clock the following afternoon - a startling two hours earlier than expected - while she was in the bath, a woman knocked at her door holding a baby. Patti hurried into a dressing-gown and the baby (she was eight-and-a-half months old) was put into her arms.</p> <p>'Shu Min, bye bye Shu Min,' the woman said and closed the door. Patti translates her baby's name delightedly: 'Shu Min means ladylike and clever.' The baby 'cried for about 10 seconds. She got very quiet. Her expression was of absolute misery. She was very watchful and closed in on herself. From behind that screen, she watched everything. She clung to me like a monkey, she looked at everything. She would not let me put her down for 48 hours. I have blonde hair. What did she think of that? She had never been out of an orphanage.'</p> <p>The orphanage director summoned the adoptive parents in the hotel (there was a small group of them) and told them about the babies' routine. 'They had done a very good job with the babies,' Patti concluded. She wasn't, however, able to do a good job herself. She recalls the technical hitches: a bottle that was too hot, Chinese nappies she couldn't figure out: Grace ended up with a nappy on the wrong way round.</p> <p>She and the other adoptive parents were lucky enough to visit the orphanage, the Yangzhou Social Welfare Institute. 'We pulled into the grounds. It looked like a hotel with air conditioning. It really was quite a nice place. Each baby had one special care giver. All the babies had walkers. They all made a big fuss about Grace. She is such an engaging little person. They were warm. You could see they loved these children. But, oddly enough, it was as though the babies had never seen their carers before, it was as though they had already switched over.'</p> <p>Grace is flourishing, and in Patti's street in the States there are six babies, four of whom are also adopted from overseas. America adopts more children from abroad than any country in the world (the number of visas granted for orphans from overseas doubled from 8,102 in 1989 to 16,396 in 1999). The process is straightforward: a couple of sessions with a social worker and then about three months of paperwork. Peter Selman believes that Britain could learn from America: they have excellent access to information and good support networks. But he does not believe that America offers a perfect model: there are too many unregulated agencies and the vetting may not be stringent enough.</p> <p>In this country, as O'Hanlon says, it is still difficult to adopt from overseas. But she insists: 'It is possible, unless you have a really bad background. You just need to be an ordinary person.' She adds, regretfully, 'with the funds'. If you adopt from this country, you do not have to pay for a home study. But if you adopt from overseas, you will (unless your local authority is exceptional) have to finance yourself. It is an expensive gamble, as you may not be passed as a parent. The home study may cost anything between \u00a3500 and \u00a34,000 (usually six sessions of two hours each). And many adopters will already have paid for unsuccessful fertility treatment. Everyone I spoke to agreed that the cost of home studies should be streamlined. And then there is the expense of the travel. There are further costs on arrival overseas, legal and administrative fees to be paid (and, in China, the mandatory gift of $3,000 to the orphanage). At present, the overall cost of adopting a child from overseas is likely to be between \u00a310,000 and \u00a315,000 (with exceptions at the lower and upper end).</p> <p>It is far easier to become a social worker than an adoptive parent. Social work is under-subscribed and under-funded. And the calibre of many social workers, who are, after all, playing God, is in doubt. Most parents I spoke to felt that social workers were invasive in a good cause. One adoptive father even said (and he was only half joking): 'I think all parents should be interviewed before having children.'</p> <p>But parents have been turned down for being too fat, too middle class, having too many books or not enough sex, being too old, the wrong colour, or for showing insufficient grief about their infertility. One parent was upset when her social worker insisted that she and her husband use contraception throughout the adoption process to ensure that no surprise baby scupper the process. Others complained that it was farcical to be expected to answer questions about precisely how they would bring up a child before they had tried to do so.</p> <p>Karen and Tony Franco from Wandsworth, London have adopted a Chinese girl, Mae (who will be three in January). The Francos were attracted to China partly because they could be sure there was nothing bogus about its need. But it took two-and-a-half years to be accepted. Karen describes it as a 'massive lottery'. Social workers are often under-informed about overseas adoption. Unless you know where to look, Karen says, there is a dearth of information. She describes the 'negative culture' of application. The first form (known as Form F) that the adopter receives will give details of how to complain when applications are turned down. Karen still remembers that 'the feeling of not having any power was awful'. The Francos were given books to study on interracial adoption and were 'tested' on them. Now they sing Mae Chinese songs, go to Chinatown for New Year, watch Chinese films. Tony is even attempting to learn Mandarin. But Karen is realistic: she does not want to overdo it, after all, Mae is growing up in this country. 'She can point to China on a globe, but to her it may be the same as Sainsbury's.'</p> <p>At a conference on intercountry adoption earlier this year, held by the Overseas Adoption Helpline, speakers from adoption agencies in India, Thailand and the Philippines made it clear that intercountry adoption is always a last resort after attempts at local or inter-regional matching.</p> <p>It is well understood that it may be hard for children adopted from overseas, later in life, to form a sense of identity. Some seem to arrive at a hybrid self, a marriage of two countries. But how do they decide where they belong? And what about language? The loss of a mother tongue is likely to exile them from their origins. It is hard to grow up with the past as a question mark, with no medical records, no clues to your genes. </p> <p>Professionals and parents encourage adoptive parents to glean as much information as possible at the time of adoption. Even information about an orphanage and its caregivers is thought better than nothing. And perhaps adopted Chinese girls will arrive at some sense of collective identity: they are, after all, a part of their country's history.</p> <p>Gill Shukla is white British, but her husband is of Indian origin. They have two children from the same Indian orphanage. She puts it like this: 'You are adopting the country as well as the child.' Adoption in India, according to Andal Damodaran, the chairperson of the Central Adoption Resource Agency in India, is a traditional practice with its principles established in the fourth century BC; it is seen as 'a gift, confirmed with a libation of water'. But even with a population of one billion, the numbers of children adopted overseas from India is tiny. Gill spent two months in the orphanage with her eldest daughter.('They massaged the babies every day,'she recalls). Each baby in the orphanage was given a shawl and Gill has kept this along with her own memories to pass on. </p> <p>Julia Fleming, who edits the newsletter for the overseas adoption charity Oasis, and has adopted children of her own, points out that race is as important as culture. Children in mixed race families are often obviously 'different' and need to take 'pride in the way they look'. They need help if they are visibly different from their parents. They need protecting from racism: it is helpful to live in a multicultural area. Gill agrees with Julia Fleming, but also finds much to celebrate in difference. She loves it when she sees characteristics in her daughters that are dramatically their own. 'We are not looking for a reflection of our own personalities in our children.' Sometimes she thinks: 'Wow! That's not us. It is lovely. We can view their passions much more objectively. I am quite in awe of them. They are very strong characters.' Almost all the mothers I spoke to described their adopted children as having 'strong' characters. Make of it what you will.</p> <p>Stories about adoption divide between those about disturbed children that break up their families and those that imply that 'love is all you need' (as if that were ever true). Yet love is only the beginning of the qualities needed to adopt a child. Whenever I asked what the most essential quality was, I got the same answer: openness. A reaction, I suspect, to a closed past - where adoption was a subject surrounded by guilt and shame.</p> <p>Gill Shukla is clear that if her daughters ever wanted to trace their birth parents, she and her husband would support them. But it is not always possible to unlock the past. They know nothing about their daughters' parents. 'For us, this is definitely the saddest part of the adoption process.' They send regular reports back to the Indian orphanage in case the parents should ever get in touch. Karen Franco also feels sad for her daughter's unknown birth mother. And she tells a poignant story about a Chinese baby whose mother tattooed her wrist so that if they should ever be thrown together by life, she would know her again. </p> <p>Adoption arises out of loss and for children adopted from overseas it is a double loss: of birth parents and their mother country (how charged that phrase seems in this context). But research carried out by Michael Rutter, professor at the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College, on Romanian orphans testifies to children's remarkable ability to compensate for early disadvantage. Their progress is a tribute, too, to their families. It would be wrong, though, to suggest an overwhelmingly optimistic picture. There are many concerns: quasi autism, hyperactivity, problems with attachment. And the research is only in its early stages. (The first stage of the study was carried out on four- to six-year-olds; the second, testing 11-year-olds, is under way).</p> <p>Rutter believes that, ideally, parents adopting from institutions ought to be prepared for some of the problems that they might encounter. These can range from autism to hyperactivity and attachment problems. There are practical challenges, too. For example many children found it hard to chew: 'They had been eating thick gruel in propped up bottles and found the transition to solid food difficult.'</p> <p>Rutter observes that there is 'an expectation that children will be lifted out of an orphan environment and pretty soon be OK. Regrettably, it is not quite like that'. Indeed, one of his most important findings is that the longer children spend in institutional care, the greater the likelihood of developmental, cognitive or social problems later on. He makes it clear that adoption is unpredictable. It is, like any attempt to raise children, an uncertain journey. Perhaps it fitting that the first photo should be passport-sized.</p> <p>Further information:</p> <p>The Overseas Adoption Helpline 0208 342 8599</p> <p>Oasis 01792 844329</p> <p>CACH Children Adopted From China Theobalds, Blackheath, Guildford, Surrey GU4 8RB</p> <p>AFAA (Association of Families who have adopted from abroad) 01707 878793</p> <p>ADOPTION UK 013277 260292</p> <p>Intercountry Adoption: Developments, Trends and Perspectives, edited by Peter Selman, is avaliable from British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering, Skyline House, 200 Union Street, London SE1 0LX, price \u00a316.95 plus \u00a33.50 p&amp;p</p> <p><strong>My son said he felt empty</strong></p> <p>Benedict's wish to see his birth mother finally came true</p> <p>Claire Andersen and her husband have three adopted children, two from El Salvador and one from Paraguay. She says: 'Adoption arises out of tragedy.' She is troubled by the inequality between 'articulate, wealthy, First World, would-be adopters and inarticulate, disenfranchised birth mothers'. She does more than pay lip-service to these views. Her openness has taken her on a remarkable journey.</p> <p>She always felt it important to try to listen, but was not prepared when her son, Benedict, at six, suddenly expressed the desire to find his birth mother. She was 'staggered' by his insistence and predicted, perhaps hoped, that the intensity would pass. A year later, he was still clear about what he wanted. After careful thought, she decided it was natural and a 'good thing' that he felt able to express this wish.</p> <p> With difficulty, through a friend in El Salvador and a television programme, Benedict's birth mother was traced and the family flew to meet her. Claire was 'terrified' because although Benedict had been legally adopted, she feared his birth mother might want him back. She hoped that if she acted out of love and trust, everything would turn out all right.</p> <p> When Benedict found his birth mother, he was 'over the moon'. Without knowing her, he had complained of a sense of 'emptiness'. Gloria, his birth mother, may have felt something similar. She told Claire she had thought about him every day since she had given him up. She had 'heard rumours that children adopted abroad from El Salvador were being ill treated'. She expressed relief: 'I know he is happy now and I can live in peace.' And Claire met a 'real person'. She shows me a picture of Benedict and Gloria - two similar, smiling faces. 'He looks so like her,' she observes, 'he has a sunny, optimistic view of life.' Benedict thanked Claire: 'I needed to know where she was. I didn't care how long it took. It was the best thing in the world.'</p> <p> They have visited the family in El Salvador three times and spent holidays together. She knows that some might think they have gone 'overboard' but believes it 'phenomenally important' that children visit their mother country and 'integrate' as far as possible. (Claire communicated in 'terrible Spanish'; Benedict's brothers took him by the hand. 'Boys don't need to talk a lot; there was a lot of grinning, punching, football.')</p> <p>Many adoptive families talk about making the trip but somehow never get on the plane. Claire feels there is a lot of 'denial' and thinks parents should, ideally, explore feelings of threat towards birth families before they adopt (in the Netherlands such preparation is compulsory). Of her own children, she concludes evocatively: 'They came with some of their culture in their bones.'</p>",

It has a past to live down: the shipping of children from British orphanages to the colonies, which started in the Twenties and only ended in the Sixties (the last boatload of 90 children left Southampton for Australia in 1967). And then there is xenophobia. The white mother of four Vietnamese and Chinese children remembers her feelings when a parent at her children's school asked tartly: 'Where did you buy them?' She describes living as an inter-racial, adoptive family in Britain as disagreeably conspicuous, like 'living inside a goldfish bowl'. Sometimes prejudice is more sly, harder to define. It seems to spring out of a we're-all-right-Jack complacency. Many couples who hope to adopt healthy babies (seldom available for adoption in this country) are dismayed to encounter censorious reaction. They are judged selfish for wanting what the rest of the world so easily and thoughtlessly produces. In a perfect world, adoption would not be necessary. But as Liv O'Hanlon of the Adoption Forum and a passionate lobbyist for reform says: 'I simply can't get past the fact that there are children out there who need families.' Hundreds and thousands of children who, for legitimate reasons, cannot find families in their own country. And although intercountry adoption used to be a wild card, under-regulated, and open to abuse, that is about to change. The 1999 Adoption Act (intercountry aspects), is to receive its finishing touches this year when the guidelines and regulations necessary to implement it will be put before the House. It will give intercountry adoption a legal framework for the first time. Britain will ratify the Hague Convention of 1993 for the Protection of Children, which will improve its international status as an adoptive country. Peter Selman, senior lecturer in sociology at Newcastle University, whose compendious anthology on the subject has just been published, believes that intercountry adoption may be about to get the boost it needs. In the Nineties, after the fall of the Ceausescu regime in 1989, there was a rush to adopt from Romanian orphanages. Today, China has replaced Romania (with Russia as a close second) as the main country for overseas adopters. Poverty and the (selectively enforced) one-child-per-family policy are among the reasons for the abandonment of hundreds and thousands of Chinese babies. Most are girls (it is traditionally boys who look after their parents in old age). The Chinese attitude towards intercountry adoption tends to be welcoming and flexible. It includes single women and older parents (the cut off age is 52), as long as they have been approved by a home study. Patti Waldmeir is a 45-year-old American and single parent. She adopted her daughter, Grace Shu Min, six months ago. Grace has just celebrated her first birthday. Patti recognises that 'to take a child out of its culture is a serious matter'. She knows nothing about Grace's birth parents. 'Selfishly, it is easier for me that no one is ever going to turn up on my door step. But I hope that Grace will understand that the pressures on her mother may have been extreme, that she will never need to feel that her mother didn't want her - she probably had no choice.' Talking to Patti is a reminder that adoption, although founded in tragedy, can also be a romance, a new version of an old story about the love between a mother and her baby. Patti was told by the adoption agency: 'You have been referred a baby' - a surreal, official phrase for such a moment. And when she saw the photo of the solemn, sweet face for the first time, a 'mugshot against a red background', she 'sobbed for a long time'. Her voice still catches now. After the photograph, 'everything went into high gear'. Over the next six weeks, there was more paperwork and a long wait for the Chinese to send approval for travel. She thought waiting would be hard but it wasn't. There was so much to do. 'You wonder what to take. Which teats? Bottles? Pacifiers? You wonder, will it be cold or warm in the hotel at night?' She took 'baby rice cereal' - and laughs at herself, 'rice to China!' She travelled heavy: there were 10lbs of documents, a buggy, medicines 'because you don't know what shape the baby will be in'. She took nappies, wipes, prunes. She arrived in China on her forty-fifth birthday, which was 'a big milestone'. At the Nanjing hotel where the babies were to be handed over, Patti set up a 'shrine' for the baby: bottles, kettle, Dr Spock. She was too excited to sleep. At three o'clock the following afternoon - a startling two hours earlier than expected - while she was in the bath, a woman knocked at her door holding a baby. Patti hurried into a dressing-gown and the baby (she was eight-and-a-half months old) was put into her arms. 'Shu Min, bye bye Shu Min,' the woman said and closed the door. Patti translates her baby's name delightedly: 'Shu Min means ladylike and clever.' The baby 'cried for about 10 seconds. She got very quiet. Her expression was of absolute misery. She was very watchful and closed in on herself. From behind that screen, she watched everything. She clung to me like a monkey, she looked at everything. She would not let me put her down for 48 hours. I have blonde hair. What did she think of that? She had never been out of an orphanage.' The orphanage director summoned the adoptive parents in the hotel (there was a small group of them) and told them about the babies' routine. 'They had done a very good job with the babies,' Patti concluded. She wasn't, however, able to do a good job herself. She recalls the technical hitches: a bottle that was too hot, Chinese nappies she couldn't figure out: Grace ended up with a nappy on the wrong way round. She and the other adoptive parents were lucky enough to visit the orphanage, the Yangzhou Social Welfare Institute. 'We pulled into the grounds. It looked like a hotel with air conditioning. It really was quite a nice place. Each baby had one special care giver. All the babies had walkers. They all made a big fuss about Grace. She is such an engaging little person. They were warm. You could see they loved these children. But, oddly enough, it was as though the babies had never seen their carers before, it was as though they had already switched over.' Grace is flourishing, and in Patti's street in the States there are six babies, four of whom are also adopted from overseas. America adopts more children from abroad than any country in the world (the number of visas granted for orphans from overseas doubled from 8,102 in 1989 to 16,396 in 1999). The process is straightforward: a couple of sessions with a social worker and then about three months of paperwork. Peter Selman believes that Britain could learn from America: they have excellent access to information and good support networks. But he does not believe that America offers a perfect model: there are too many unregulated agencies and the vetting may not be stringent enough. In this country, as O'Hanlon says, it is still difficult to adopt from overseas. But she insists: 'It is possible, unless you have a really bad background. You just need to be an ordinary person.' She adds, regretfully, 'with the funds'. If you adopt from this country, you do not have to pay for a home study. But if you adopt from overseas, you will (unless your local authority is exceptional) have to finance yourself. It is an expensive gamble, as you may not be passed as a parent. The home study may cost anything between \u00a3500 and \u00a34,000 (usually six sessions of two hours each). And many adopters will already have paid for unsuccessful fertility treatment. Everyone I spoke to agreed that the cost of home studies should be streamlined. And then there is the expense of the travel. There are further costs on arrival overseas, legal and administrative fees to be paid (and, in China, the mandatory gift of $3,000 to the orphanage). At present, the overall cost of adopting a child from overseas is likely to be between \u00a310,000 and \u00a315,000 (with exceptions at the lower and upper end). It is far easier to become a social worker than an adoptive parent. Social work is under-subscribed and under-funded. And the calibre of many social workers, who are, after all, playing God, is in doubt. Most parents I spoke to felt that social workers were invasive in a good cause. One adoptive father even said (and he was only half joking): 'I think all parents should be interviewed before having children.' But parents have been turned down for being too fat, too middle class, having too many books or not enough sex, being too old, the wrong colour, or for showing insufficient grief about their infertility. One parent was upset when her social worker insisted that she and her husband use contraception throughout the adoption process to ensure that no surprise baby scupper the process. Others complained that it was farcical to be expected to answer questions about precisely how they would bring up a child before they had tried to do so. Karen and Tony Franco from Wandsworth, London have adopted a Chinese girl, Mae (who will be three in January). The Francos were attracted to China partly because they could be sure there was nothing bogus about its need. But it took two-and-a-half years to be accepted. Karen describes it as a 'massive lottery'. Social workers are often under-informed about overseas adoption. Unless you know where to look, Karen says, there is a dearth of information. She describes the 'negative culture' of application. The first form (known as Form F) that the adopter receives will give details of how to complain when applications are turned down. Karen still remembers that 'the feeling of not having any power was awful'. The Francos were given books to study on interracial adoption and were 'tested' on them. Now they sing Mae Chinese songs, go to Chinatown for New Year, watch Chinese films. Tony is even attempting to learn Mandarin. But Karen is realistic: she does not want to overdo it, after all, Mae is growing up in this country. 'She can point to China on a globe, but to her it may be the same as Sainsbury's.' At a conference on intercountry adoption earlier this year, held by the Overseas Adoption Helpline, speakers from adoption agencies in India, Thailand and the Philippines made it clear that intercountry adoption is always a last resort after attempts at local or inter-regional matching. It is well understood that it may be hard for children adopted from overseas, later in life, to form a sense of identity. Some seem to arrive at a hybrid self, a marriage of two countries. But how do they decide where they belong? And what about language? The loss of a mother tongue is likely to exile them from their origins. It is hard to grow up with the past as a question mark, with no medical records, no clues to your genes. Professionals and parents encourage adoptive parents to glean as much information as possible at the time of adoption. Even information about an orphanage and its caregivers is thought better than nothing. And perhaps adopted Chinese girls will arrive at some sense of collective identity: they are, after all, a part of their country's history. Gill Shukla is white British, but her husband is of Indian origin. They have two children from the same Indian orphanage. She puts it like this: 'You are adopting the country as well as the child.' Adoption in India, according to Andal Damodaran, the chairperson of the Central Adoption Resource Agency in India, is a traditional practice with its principles established in the fourth century BC; it is seen as 'a gift, confirmed with a libation of water'. But even with a population of one billion, the numbers of children adopted overseas from India is tiny. Gill spent two months in the orphanage with her eldest daughter.('They massaged the babies every day,'she recalls). Each baby in the orphanage was given a shawl and Gill has kept this along with her own memories to pass on. Julia Fleming, who edits the newsletter for the overseas adoption charity Oasis, and has adopted children of her own, points out that race is as important as culture. Children in mixed race families are often obviously 'different' and need to take 'pride in the way they look'. They need help if they are visibly different from their parents. They need protecting from racism: it is helpful to live in a multicultural area. Gill agrees with Julia Fleming, but also finds much to celebrate in difference. She loves it when she sees characteristics in her daughters that are dramatically their own. 'We are not looking for a reflection of our own personalities in our children.' Sometimes she thinks: 'Wow! That's not us. It is lovely. We can view their passions much more objectively. I am quite in awe of them. They are very strong characters.' Almost all the mothers I spoke to described their adopted children as having 'strong' characters. Make of it what you will. Stories about adoption divide between those about disturbed children that break up their families and those that imply that 'love is all you need' (as if that were ever true). Yet love is only the beginning of the qualities needed to adopt a child. Whenever I asked what the most essential quality was, I got the same answer: openness. A reaction, I suspect, to a closed past - where adoption was a subject surrounded by guilt and shame. Gill Shukla is clear that if her daughters ever wanted to trace their birth parents, she and her husband would support them. But it is not always possible to unlock the past. They know nothing about their daughters' parents. 'For us, this is definitely the saddest part of the adoption process.' They send regular reports back to the Indian orphanage in case the parents should ever get in touch. Karen Franco also feels sad for her daughter's unknown birth mother. And she tells a poignant story about a Chinese baby whose mother tattooed her wrist so that if they should ever be thrown together by life, she would know her again. Adoption arises out of loss and for children adopted from overseas it is a double loss: of birth parents and their mother country (how charged that phrase seems in this context). But research carried out by Michael Rutter, professor at the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College, on Romanian orphans testifies to children's remarkable ability to compensate for early disadvantage. Their progress is a tribute, too, to their families. It would be wrong, though, to suggest an overwhelmingly optimistic picture. There are many concerns: quasi autism, hyperactivity, problems with attachment. And the research is only in its early stages. (The first stage of the study was carried out on four- to six-year-olds; the second, testing 11-year-olds, is under way). Rutter believes that, ideally, parents adopting from institutions ought to be prepared for some of the problems that they might encounter. These can range from autism to hyperactivity and attachment problems. There are practical challenges, too. For example many children found it hard to chew: 'They had been eating thick gruel in propped up bottles and found the transition to solid food difficult.' Rutter observes that there is 'an expectation that children will be lifted out of an orphan environment and pretty soon be OK. Regrettably, it is not quite like that'. Indeed, one of his most important findings is that the longer children spend in institutional care, the greater the likelihood of developmental, cognitive or social problems later on. He makes it clear that adoption is unpredictable. It is, like any attempt to raise children, an uncertain journey. Perhaps it fitting that the first photo should be passport-sized.

She says: 'Adoption arises out of tragedy.' She is troubled by the inequality between 'articulate, wealthy, First World, would-be adopters and inarticulate, disenfranchised birth mothers'. She does more than pay lip-service to these views. Her openness has taken her on a remarkable journey. She always felt it important to try to listen, but was not prepared when her son, Benedict, at six, suddenly expressed the desire to find his birth mother. She was 'staggered' by his insistence and predicted, perhaps hoped, that the intensity would pass. A year later, he was still clear about what he wanted. After careful thought, she decided it was natural and a 'good thing' that he felt able to express this wish. With difficulty, through a friend in El Salvador and a television programme, Benedict's birth mother was traced and the family flew to meet her. Claire was 'terrified' because although Benedict had been legally adopted, she feared his birth mother might want him back. She hoped that if she acted out of love and trust, everything would turn out all right. When Benedict found his birth mother, he was 'over the moon'. Without knowing her, he had complained of a sense of 'emptiness'. Gloria, his birth mother, may have felt something similar. She told Claire she had thought about him every day since she had given him up. She had 'heard rumours that children adopted abroad from El Salvador were being ill treated'. She expressed relief: 'I know he is happy now and I can live in peace.' And Claire met a 'real person'. She shows me a picture of Benedict and Gloria - two similar, smiling faces. 'He looks so like her,' she observes, 'he has a sunny, optimistic view of life.' Benedict thanked Claire: 'I needed to know where she was. I didn't care how long it took. It was the best thing in the world.' They have visited the family in El Salvador three times and spent holidays together. She knows that some might think they have gone 'overboard' but believes it 'phenomenally important' that children visit their mother country and 'integrate' as far as possible. (Claire communicated in 'terrible Spanish'; Benedict's brothers took him by the hand. 'Boys don't need to talk a lot; there was a lot of grinning, punching, football.') Many adoptive families talk about making the trip but somehow never get on the plane. Claire feels there is a lot of 'denial' and thinks parents should, ideally, explore feelings of threat towards birth families before they adopt (in the Netherlands such preparation is compulsory). Of her own children, she concludes evocatively: 'They came with some of their culture in their bones.'",

The Norwegians, natural respecters of severe weather, mounted polar expeditions with skis, sledges, dogs, Eskimo-style clothing and a high-fat diet. Most importantly, Amundsen wanted to be there. Fired by Nansen's achievements, he had a willingness to learn and adapt, went on the nearly-fatal Belgica trip in 1892, and, by the time he led his own expedition, had a clear idea of how to go about it. Scott, primarily a naval officer, appears to have gone into polar exploration purely for advancement. He refused to go to Scandinavia to learn skiing, sledging or dog-handling, preferring to use ponies, motor sledges (he lost one unloading it from the boat on to thin ice), tinned food which led to appalling scurvy, and a team of men whom he kept largely in ignorance of his unformed plans. Captain Oates loathed him; his mother referred to Scott as the murderer of her son. Reading this book made my blood boil at the pig-headed arrogance of the man.",

She wasn't there.' The most quietly wrenching passages in The Peppered Moth are from Margaret Drabble's Afterword rather than the novel itself. Alluding to a myth in which a woman entered hell disguised as one of the dead, she adds: 'I feel, in writing this, that I have made myself smell of dead rat, and I am not sure how to get rid of the smell.'</p> <p>In autobiographical writing, the stakes are by definition higher for the writer than the reader, who may see the enterprise in terms of self-defeating exercise and iffy taste, rather than failed quest and spiritual contamination.</p> <p>Drabble reconstructs her mother's early life, using family documents and research, resorting to invention only to fill gaps. Kathleen Marie Bloor (to whom the book is dedicated), born 1905, lightly disguised here as Bessie Bawtry, was on the point of escaping the restrictions of her background in a South Yorkshire mining town when she won a place at Cambridge. She seemed to have reached escape velocity, but the second-stage booster of the academic rocket did not properly ignite.</p> <p>She graduated without distinction (though a reference from F.R.

Having - memorable phrase - 'suffered a good education', she becomes a dissatisfied and highly manipulative wife and mother.</p> <p>From this point, the fiction is free. Drabble has replaced her own generation with a conformist son, Robert, and a rebellious daughter, Chrissie. Robert avoids entanglements, while Chrissie marries a handsome and tempestuous philanderer, by whom she has a daughter, before settling down with a calm and supportive second husband. By her own account, Drabble has used the alternate reality of fiction to explore a more hopeful set of possibilities than life actually offered. Chrissie finds first excitement and then stability; her daughter, Faro, has opportunities to combine them.</p> <p>In a sense, minimising the legacy of damage you feel your mother left seems like letting her off the hook, a halfway stage towards forgiving her. Certainly, nothing said about Bessie puts her in the first rank of domestic tyrants, up there with Compton-Burnett's cold monsters or Gibbons's Aunt Ada Doom, and the violations of privacy here are almost absurdly mild by the standards of a Kureishi or a Roth. Yet Drabble rightly fears that her tone is sometimes 'harsh, dismissive, censorious'.</p> <p>Her trademark manner, which leavens traditional narration with passages of direct address, can easily slide into something schoolma'amish - both informal and controlling. 'See them now...'; 'Picture them there...'; 'Cast your eye around, and see if you can discern a pattern among these descendants... can you discern the form of their common ancestor?' Sorry, Miss, I don't know, I'm not in the room. 'Do not titter. Badger is a good Yorkshire name, and not to be ridiculed.' Didn't mean to.</p> <p>The most unsatisfactory part of the book is necessarily the hinge where the documentary panel is attached to the purely fictional one, after the failure of Bessie's bid for freedom. No longer is she built up, with however limited a sympathy, from inside, but viewed by others. Rather than masking the weakness of the join, Drabble emphasises it with a passage of direct address, containing the only acknowledgement within the body of the text that it is based on fact:</p> <p>'If this story were merely a fiction, it would be possible to fill in these gaps with plausible incidents, but the narrator here has to admit to considerable difficulty, indeed to failure. I have tried - and I apologise for that intrusive authorial \"I\", which I have done my best to avoid - I have tried to understand why Joe and Bessie married, and I have tried to invent some plausible dialogue for them that might explain it.'</p> <p>If the book's goal is to unearth a continuity between the young hopes-and-dreams Bessie and the soured, mature one, then rejecting the assistance of imagination seems like an act of bad faith. It's too late, having changed the names and prepared the ground, to renounce the impurity of fiction.</p> <p>Margaret Forster in Hidden Lives (1995) also explored family history, the culture of unfulfilment (for women, above all) of the early twentieth century, and the martyred, masochistic matrons of the North. Her chronicle was more optimistic, showing a clear progression in women's ability to control their lives, but it also contained a larger portion of classic family shame - illegitimacy, an unacknowledged child. Forster chose to write non-fiction, and rigorously reined in speculation, however tempted by it. Fiction may abhor a vacuum, but non-fiction respects the integrity of the gap.</p> <p>The 'peppered moth' of the title is Biston betularia, whose paler variations suffered in the soot-polluted environment which made them visible to predators, while the darker ones survived. This is hardly a satisfying master-image for the book; Bessie's temperamental darkening is almost the opposite of an adaptation. But it is part of Drabble's practice as a novelist to supply multiple partial frameworks of interpretation - here not only the impact of a degraded environment on individual specimens, but a project to collect DNA from locals and establish their continuity with prehistory.</p> <p>Recounting the history of Bessie's granddaughter, far from the restrictions of fact, she comes up with a version of the Persephone myth, with Faro divided between the claims of a morbid and a vital lover.</p> <p>The novel's suppressed core image may not be a dark moth at all, but an albino caterpillar. Throughout their marriage, Joe brought Bessie an early morning cup of tea, and she 'lay there like a white worm and took it from him'. On a transatlantic cruise, she lies in her bunk 'as in a chrysalis, a white grub in her girlish white nightdress'.</p> <p>These images are shocking only because they are not assigned to any point of view but the author's.

He didn't have his own driver then - he drove himself. 'At the NME I got a long way on very little talent,' he happily admits.</p> <p>Parsons has travelled a lot further since, from spiky punk correspondent to cream of the Eighties style press; from moneyed Fleet Street mouthpiece to chin-stroking BBC2 arts pundit, and now popular novelist. Yet he talks frequently about the limits of his own ability, describes 'holding his own' against John Grisham and Thomas Harris in the end-of-year sales charts as like 'playing in the World Cup', and states, of fiction writing, 'I'll never be so proficient at the craft that I'll be able to get it right in one go.'</p> <p>To the casual observer, Tony Parsons, 45, did get it right in one go. His first novel after years of polemic, Man And Boy was an unexpected critical success and it flew off the shelves of airport and train station bookstands. Published in 16 countries, to date it has sold 700,000 copies (650,000 in paperback) and is currently being adapted by the BBC. Except of course it isn't his first novel at all: he wrote the precocious The Kids when he was 17, and three functional potboilers during his lean years in the Eighties, but to the public at large, Man And Boy is his debut, and the author is happy with the white lie of posterity.</p> <p>Needless to say, there's a lot riding on One For My Baby. 'It's quite intimidating,' says Parsons, 'because you only really sell that number if people like it, and I don't know that the next one is quite as warm and cuddly. Man And Boy sold 20,000 copies last week, and it's impossible to finish a book with that kind of success hanging over you and not be influenced by it.'</p> <p>In October, Parsons and his editor took the first draft of One For My Baby to a hotel near Kensington Palace and talked about it for a whole weekend. 'We kept asking ourselves, is it too much like Man And Boy, or is it not enough like Man And Boy?'</p> <p>Man And Boy was what Parsons calls 'a generational love story'. Marketed as a Hornbyesque examination of how a lone dad copes with a four-year-old son, it was far more rewarding in the other direction, in describing TV producer Harry's relationship with his dying father. 'I wanted to write about my dad dying,' he says. Lung cancer took the 'old man' in 1987, aged 62. But Man And Boy is dedicated to Parsons's mother, who also died of cancer before he delivered the manuscript (she was 73). Her death is fictionalised in One For My Baby.</p> <p>'You use what you've got,' he says, reminding me of the Raymond Carver poem 'Sunday Night' ('Make use of the things around you put it all in, make use'). Parsons wrote about his mother's death in the Mirror, where his weekly column earns him a reputed \u00a3100,000 a year. She died in the early hours of Friday morning, he spoke to Piers Morgan, the paper's editor, as her body was being removed by the funeral directors, wrote the copy on Saturday, filed on Sunday, and it was published on Monday. 'People said it was brave, but it wasn't at all, it made it a lot easier for me.'</p> <p>Parsons has talked a lot about his father's death, how he 'butched it out' and kept the cancer to himself, to protect his family, but his mother's passing is still quite raw in him. 'My mum was this little, skinny Cockney woman, quite courageous, and the difference between her and my dad is that I was there holding her hand when the consultant said \"We've had a look at your biopsy, Mrs Parsons, and as we'd expect in a woman of your age, it is malignant and I'm afraid there's nothing we can do\".'</p> <p>'She inspired so much affection among the neighbours and her friends and family. People would do anything for her. What a great life. So although it was terrible seeing her go through it, in some ways you come out of it thinking this world is not such a wicked place after all.'</p> <p>One For My Baby concerns a man in his late twenties whose wife dies, and who decides to devote his life (or 'his nasty little knob') to meaningless relationships with women. 'It's about a man banging his head against the limits of promiscuity.' It's also 'more fathers and sons' - although this time the father is closer to Glenn in Man And Boy, a relic of the Sixties - 'refuses to relinquish his youth, shagging the au pair'. Parsons admits that as a father (his son Bobby is now a 19-year-old footballer for Brighton youth team and an NME reader) he always wanted to be like his own, 'but I fear that I'm more like the dad in the new book'.</p> <p>If Parsons is a relic it's not from the Sixties, when he grew up, but the Fifties when he was born. No ponytail has ever troubled his adult collar. He is a product of post-war austerity and family values, raised in Romford, then Great Burstead, near Basildon, at a time when the suburbs meant community, not wife-swapping, golf and Valium. </p> <p>It is customary to remark on the fashionable clothes Tony Parsons wears - expensive labels which confirm him as a working-class boy made good - but since this is not my area I can only tell you he was wearing a jumper, a watch, some shoes and trousers when I met him. He was remarkably well turned out though: neat, trim and polite, the epitome of old-fashioned manners mixed with the rather more exotic philosophy of kung fu, which he's learning.</p> <p>He may not be able to show his future grandson the equivalent of the Distinguished Service Medal won by his father, but he retains the values handed down to him, most notably those of an honest day's work and the right to be paid for it. 'I've always taken money really seriously, and it's not the thing to do in the middle-class media. They phone you up and say, \"Tony, darling, would you like to write 1,000 words for the New Statesman,\" and I'll say, \"What's the money like?\" That's why I go to work. I've got a family to support.'</p> <p>Tony Parsons expected 'a kicking' when Man And Boy was published, fearing that critics would review not the book but him, the feather-ruffling bigmouth persona he'd forged in print and on the telly. He got glowing notices, all the way from the Mail to the Literary Review (Jeremy Paxman and James Brown both confessed to blubbing, and Anthea Turner wrote him a nice letter), but critics were still reviewing the man: Tony Parsons is not the hate figure he'd like to believe - he's either liked, or secretly liked, throughout the media - his ex-wife Julie Burchill being the exception. (Years after that fraught relationship ended, Parsons now lives with his second wife, Yuriko, a Japanese translator.)</p> <p>Parsons stands proud, but against an opposition that isn't really there. (His dad had Hitler, he has... who? Victor Lewis-Smith?) When he took his son to school as a single parent, he vividly remembers all the other mothers looking at him disapprovingly, and this paranoia persists. Are all the middle-class people still looking at him? Well, yes, but only with admiration for his pithy putdowns. In the archaic caste system of newspapers, Parsons may still represent the tabloid underclass, while his novel-writing rival Nick Hornby is seen as broadsheet aristocracy, but because of BBC2's Late Review, which he did for six years, he occupies a unique position of 'honorary ponce'.</p> <p>Parsons disappeared from the programme's line up when it transferred to a more populist Sunday teatime slot as plain old Review last year, but, he reveals, he may yet return when it's shunted back and absorbed into Newsnight. Presenter and friend Mark Lawson is delighted. 'We miss him terribly,' he says, echoing the views of many who have watched the programme struggle gamely without him. </p> <p>In typical Parsons fashion, he fell out with BBC2 controller Jane Root over an unfortunate comment she made in an interview about Review's revamp in which she said that its regular critics hadn't done anything. He took umbrage, although in reality he wanted to 'do a Paul Merton' anyway and sit one series out while he wrote One For My Baby. It was telling that no effort was made to replace Parsons (his chair was filled by a revolving cartel of lesser folk who'd done something). 'He is irreplaceable,' says Lawson, 'because he's the most unpredictable critic we've ever had - he's right-wing, which most critics aren't, so he gets you away from the general liberal agenda.'</p> <p>Despite Lawson's playful assertion, Parsons voted Labour in 1997 and plans to do so again this year under duress. He has made himself indispensable in the media, and controls his celebrity carefully. He turned downed OK!, but volunteered for Richard and Judy, knowing it would shift 10,000 books. A middle-aged cameraman on This Morning hugged him, saying Man And Boy had reminded him of his own father dying of cancer. 'I can't help but be moved by that. If I'd just written a book about myself, that guy would probably have never even heard of it. There's not 700,000 people who are interested in my life, and there's no reason why they should be.'</p> <p>Parsons has found a new kind of fame by writing a popular novel, one that far outstrips being on BBC2. 'Somebody comes up to me every day,' he tells me. 'I'm surprised by that, because I thought that nothing was as intimate as TV, but, of course, you're in someone's living-room and they're putting the kettle on. You could appear on TV year after year and mean nothing at all, whereas a book is quite an intimate transaction. You can't read Man And Boy and not get some sense of me.'</p> <p>This embrace of populism is what marks Parsons out from many of his contemporaries. Paul Morley, who was taken on by the NME as reserve 'hip young gunslinger' at the same time as Parsons and Burchill, also wrote a book about his father's death, Nothing, published last year. While at times a beautiful memoir, it was never likely to reach a wider audience. Parsons, meanwhile, turned his dad's passing into an easy-to-read bestseller, with no less sensitivity, but considerably more sales.</p> <p>Likewise, the Mirror sells more than the New Statesman, and the NME used to sell more than Sounds. Parsons reckons there are two types of music journalist: those who are in it for the music and those who are in it for the writing. He was very definitely the latter ('rock'n'roll, I gave you a few years of my life,' he quips), and what's the point of writing postcards to your friends, when you've got it in you to write the fourth most popular fiction title last year?</p> <p>Parsons and his publishers hope that One For My Baby, due out in May (around the same time as Hornby's follow-up to About A Boy, suicidally enough for both), will do similar business, and the Parsons literary brand will be consolidated: the king of middlebrow fiction.</p> <p>'It wouldn't bother me being called that,' he says from the back of the car (the manuscript occupies the front seat). 'I don't deliberately dumb my stuff down but it's not going to win literary prizes. It's written with pure motives. I want laughter and tears, that's all I ask. Maybe I'm taking middlebrow upmarket.'</p> <p>\u0095 Tony Parsons will be discussing Man and Boy - a hit among the prison population - on Radio 4's Book Club, to be broadcast from HMP Cordingly at 4pm today</p>",

      "bodyText": "It's rare that the delivery of an author's manuscript to its publisher is considered newsworthy. Tom Wolfe made the front page of the New York Times when he handed in A Man In Full; the package FedExed by Thomas Harris to Random House containing Hannibal was also widely reported, as was the day in 1991 when Harold Brodkey's The Runaway Soul (27 years in the writing) finally went whoomph on his publisher's desk. Tony Parsons might not place himself in the same league but he can now add himself to that list. The manuscript of One For My Baby, follow-up to the best-selling Man And Boy was delivered on Thursday. I should know; I shared a car with the sealed Jiffy bag as Parsons personally couriered it to HarperCollins in Hammersmith. 'Maybe you'll bring me luck,' he said, without good reason. Tony Parsons creates his own luck, through a combination of tenacity, self-belief and a genuine eagerness to please, forged as an only child living above a greengrocer's in Essex. Thursday's historic drop-off was a far cry from his days of delivering amphetamine dispatches to aggrieved NME sub-editors in the late Seventies. He didn't have his own driver then - he drove himself. 'At the NME I got a long way on very little talent,' he happily admits. Parsons has travelled a lot further since, from spiky punk correspondent to cream of the Eighties style press; from moneyed Fleet Street mouthpiece to chin-stroking BBC2 arts pundit, and now popular novelist. Yet he talks frequently about the limits of his own ability, describes 'holding his own' against John Grisham and Thomas Harris in the end-of-year sales charts as like 'playing in the World Cup', and states, of fiction writing, 'I'll never be so proficient at the craft that I'll be able to get it right in one go.'

      "body": "<p>Brett De La Mare, the Australian paraglider who dropped in on Buckingham Palace to promote a wider interest in his unpublished novel, provides another sharp reminder of the desperate lengths to which some people will go to draw attention to their work.</p> <p>I remember, years ago, sharing a breakfast TV sofa with the rock star Alice Cooper and a boa constrictor. Mr Cooper - we never quite got on to 'Alice' terms - was promoting an album entitled Constrictor. I recall thinking that at least, in the world of books, there were still a few limits.</p> <p>That was then. De La Mare, meanwhile, appears to have been to the Alice Cooper school of publicity. Canine Dawn may or, more probably, may not, succeed in finding a publisher but its author's drastic aerial manoeuvre was simply an extreme example of a genre. To those of us in the business, it was different only in degree from more conventional book publicity measures. In the past year alone I can recall an editor who posed naked with rose petals in Waterstone's to promote a book about the film American Beauty, a children's book author who invited the press on a special train, and any number of gimmicky book launches involving fancy dress, fancy cocktails and fancy guests.</p> <p>If these are some of the tricks exploited by writers who already have book publishers, it seems quite reasonable to me that an Australian who is fed up with rejection slips should break the royal 'no-fly' zone and thereby solicit an interview with the literary division of Scotland Yard. These men, according to De La Mare, have 'got a good sense of humour and [were] very courteous and professional.' He might not have had the same treatment at the hands of many literary critics. Elsewhere, in fact, the author of Canine Dawn has had a rough ride. In New York, apparently, he was verbally roughed up by shock-jock radio hosts, and who knows what scorn he's endured in his native land?</p> <p>Here, too, the difference is one of degree. The life of the published author can be quite as humiliating as Howard Stern's abuse. The ill-attended signing session, the 30-second appearance on Radio 2, the down-the-line interview with Radio TK: such is the fate of many published writers in the UK - and these are the lucky ones.</p> <p>More seriously, the brief, inglorious flight of Brett De La Mare offers a grim window on the plight of the unpublished writer, and the quest for a sympathetic response from within the publishing community. To those of us who work as gatekeepers to the lower steps of Parnassus, the world sometimes seems full of struggling artists yearning for that big break, the invitation to step inside the citadel.</p> <p>And that's not even the half of it. Even if your book is eventually accepted for publication, you join an ever-growing herd of new titles (more than 110,000 a year, according to a recent count) jostling for attention. No wonder, then, that writers in Britain will earn, on average, less than a shop assistant at Marks and Spencer.</p> <p>Yet, for all the obstacles placed in their path, I believe that really good books do get read, do get reviewed and do, ultimately, get passed from hand to hand, and will live on. In my experience, editors are only too eager to unearth a new talent, only too glad to celebrate the discovery of work they feel to be truly exceptional.</p> <p>You cannot beat good writing. If it speaks to the reader, you can wrap it in brown paper, and reproduce it on a Xerox machine, and it will always find an audience. That, after all, was how samizdat worked in the last years of the Soviet empire. For every dull book by a well-connected author that gets hyped and overpraised (but doesn't sell) I can think of dozens that get virtually no publicity and which continue to find a loyal and steady audience.</p> <p>Two examples from the past year spring to mind. First - and most extraordinarily - is Naomi Klein's No Logo (HarperCollins), a call to arms for the post-Seattle generation and the unofficial manifesto of the anti-corporate activist, a Zeitgeist book that's flourished with (so far as I know) barely a penny of advertising. And then there's a little book of essays, Ex Libris (Penguin) by the American writer Anne Fadiman, a delightful (and exquisitely written) volume which has flourished from reprint to reprint solely by word of mouth. As far as I know, Fadiman has no plans to take up paragliding.</p>",

In the past year alone I can recall an editor who posed naked with rose petals in Waterstone's to promote a book about the film American Beauty, a children's book author who invited the press on a special train, and any number of gimmicky book launches involving fancy dress, fancy cocktails and fancy guests. If these are some of the tricks exploited by writers who already have book publishers, it seems quite reasonable to me that an Australian who is fed up with rejection slips should break the royal 'no-fly' zone and thereby solicit an interview with the literary division of Scotland Yard. These men, according to De La Mare, have 'got a good sense of humour and [were] very courteous and professional.' He might not have had the same treatment at the hands of many literary critics. Elsewhere, in fact, the author of Canine Dawn has had a rough ride. In New York, apparently, he was verbally roughed up by shock-jock radio hosts, and who knows what scorn he's endured in his native land? Here, too, the difference is one of degree. The life of the published author can be quite as humiliating as Howard Stern's abuse. The ill-attended signing session, the 30-second appearance on Radio 2, the down-the-line interview with Radio TK: such is the fate of many published writers in the UK - and these are the lucky ones. More seriously, the brief, inglorious flight of Brett De La Mare offers a grim window on the plight of the unpublished writer, and the quest for a sympathetic response from within the publishing community. To those of us who work as gatekeepers to the lower steps of Parnassus, the world sometimes seems full of struggling artists yearning for that big break, the invitation to step inside the citadel. And that's not even the half of it. Even if your book is eventually accepted for publication, you join an ever-growing herd of new titles (more than 110,000 a year, according to a recent count) jostling for attention. No wonder, then, that writers in Britain will earn, on average, less than a shop assistant at Marks and Spencer. Yet, for all the obstacles placed in their path, I believe that really good books do get read, do get reviewed and do, ultimately, get passed from hand to hand, and will live on. In my experience, editors are only too eager to unearth a new talent, only too glad to celebrate the discovery of work they feel to be truly exceptional. You cannot beat good writing. If it speaks to the reader, you can wrap it in brown paper, and reproduce it on a Xerox machine, and it will always find an audience. That, after all, was how samizdat worked in the last years of the Soviet empire. For every dull book by a well-connected author that gets hyped and overpraised (but doesn't sell) I can think of dozens that get virtually no publicity and which continue to find a loyal and steady audience. Two examples from the past year spring to mind. First - and most extraordinarily - is Naomi Klein's No Logo (HarperCollins), a call to arms for the post-Seattle generation and the unofficial manifesto of the anti-corporate activist, a Zeitgeist book that's flourished with (so far as I know) barely a penny of advertising. And then there's a little book of essays, Ex Libris (Penguin) by the American writer Anne Fadiman, a delightful (and exquisitely written) volume which has flourished from reprint to reprint solely by word of mouth. As far as I know, Fadiman has no plans to take up paragliding.",

But he remains not exactly Catholic, not exactly British, not exactly celibate, not exactly believing. And, to his growing distress, not exactly Jewish either.</p> <p>For Edmond, the priesthood is disguise and routine - 'a habit, in both senses of the word' - and he fends off attempts to flush out his disguise and unsettle his routine. His adversary, a pursed American priest called Fred Twombly, slavers to nudge him out of office, sneering at his Jewish origins, sniffing for peccadilloes. Beneath this narrative are remorseful memories of his parents - a mother killed by the Nazis, a father appalled by his apostasy - and his implicit betrayal of the millions who died in the Holocaust.</p> <p>Edmond lards his account with Latinate innuendo and tags from the poets, Shakespeare above all (he is on the far side of bardolatry). Shakespeare provides a continual reference point, as when Edmond compares himself to an unheroic Othello, uneasy with otherness. He equally finds echoes in the guilty lovers of Dante and Milton.

His narrative is interleaved with researches into the eighteenth-century Jewish kabbalist Solomon Falsch, a fictional charismatic sage and alchemist hailed as the Ba'al Shem of Ludlow, and modelled on the celebrated London magus Samuel Falk.</p> <p>Falsch, known to his followers as the Pish (Isler never resists a smutty pun), illuminates the story of a collection of sonnets of uncertain provenance that may just be a lost work by Shakespeare. This elusive volume, whereabouts currently unknown, was secretly sold during Edmond's early days at Beale Hall, and a reference in a bookseller's catalogue gives the embittered Twombly further ammunition against him. Clerical Errors is tugged by the transmigration of books, from reader to library, from collector to enthusiast.</p> <p>Beale Hall, we learn, was designed in the late seventeenth century by Vanbrugh, playwright and architect, a perfect setting for a comedy of avarice and lost love. As in previous work, Isler uses a farcical structure of imperilled concealment and unravelling security, but with an increasingly melancholy undertow. Farce is a tired, despairing genre, hounding characters who can only lose. Edmond is weary but creaks on, plays the game, willing it to stop.</p> <p>Isler is unsparing in cataloguing the crimes of the Catholic church, from persecution to paedophilia. The most widespread clerical error appears to be propagating nonsensical doctrine or, even worse, believing in it oneself. The dubious consolations of hypocrisy are such that all the central characters are mired in roles they have played too long. Bastien, Edmond's slippered servant, dwindles into senility and makes the sign of the cross over coffee-pots. His defiantly rational neighbour robustly snorts at Catholic chop-logic but yearns for the comfort of faith.</p> <p>The mendacious protagonist of Isler's last novel, Kraven Images, was stripped of love, position and family, and unexpectedly welcomed an end to the masquerade. Edmond is way ahead of him, and for all its wit and spite, Clerical Errors cannot summon the robustly libidinous energy of its predecessor. Its capering narrative unfolds in what Edmond knows is a bleak, empty universe. 'Hope is the cruellest of the many cruel jokes we are born to suffer,' he muses. 'The only words in the New Testament that have the ring of authenticity, I sometimes think, are, \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?\" '</p> <p>In this darkly assured novel, Isler extends his focus from the fallout of twentieth-century Jewish experience to the attempt to lead a rational life amid the clutter of delusive wisdom.

'The only words in the New Testament that have the ring of authenticity, I sometimes think, are, \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?\" ' In this darkly assured novel, Isler extends his focus from the fallout of twentieth-century Jewish experience to the attempt to lead a rational life amid the clutter of delusive wisdom. The Good Book may be of little help, but his faith clings to the solace of a good read.",

Stuart, who died last year aged 97, angrily denied the charge and won IR\u00a3100,000 in libel damages from the Irish Times. He also sued a magazine which printed a letter accusing him of being a Nazi. Now a new book on Stuart's writings and wartime broadcasts has shown that Stuart held anti-semitic opinions as far back as 1924. And those on the sharp end of the late writer's litigation are bitter that had the new evidence been available even 18 months ago they would not have had to pay damages. Stuart was the author of more than 30 novels and held the position of Saoi, the highest honour the Irish arts body, Aosd\u00e1na, can bestow on an artist. He was born in Australia but returned to Ireland following the death of his father. As a young poet in the 1920s he married Iseult MacBride, daughter of Maude Gonne and sister of Sean MacBride. He was encouraged in his early poetry by Yeats. During the Irish Civil war he fought on the Republican side with de Valera and was taken prisoner by the Free State forces.

Decades after the war, Stuart's friends in Ireland used this apparent absence of anti-semitism to argue that the writer was really a hopeless apolitical romantic who fled to Germany as an act of personal rebellion. The Wartime Broadcasts of Francis Stuart, edited by Brendan Barrington, throws fresh light on the author's opinions of Jews. Barrington has discovered a 16-page IRA pamphlet Stuart wrote in March 1924 called Lecture on Nationality and Culture. In it Stuart compares the malign influence of England on Ireland to the power the Jews allegedly exercised over post-World War I Austria, a country he visited in 1921. 'At that time Vienna was full of Jews, who controlled the banks and factories and even a large part of the government; the Austrians themselves seemed about to be driven out of their own city.' Barrington also discovered a letter Stuart wrote to the Irish Times in 1938 - the same newspaper that 61 years later paid him IR\u00a3100,000 in costs and damages for daring to suggest he was anti-semitic - calling for Ireland to close its doors on refugees, including Jews fleeing Hitler's tyranny. The critic and novelist Colm Toibin, long a defender of Stuart, now accepts that Stuart 're-imagined' his own role in Nazi Germany after the war.

But Kevin Myers, the Irish Times columnist whose articles on Stuart led to the libel action, said he was bitterly disappointed that newspapers were forced to pay out to 'this dreadful impostor'. He added: 'It's disgusting that we had to pay out such a sum to a man who obviously held deeply anti-semitic views and worshipped Hitler. At the time of the libel trial no one knew about the 1924 pamphlet or had discovered the 1938 letter. The award to this man was a grotesque miscarriage of justice. 'What's even more disturbing is to think about all those who defended this Jew hater and how they exalted him for so long in Ireland.' His defenders, who included the novelist Ulick O'Connor and the historian Anthony Cronin, say that the bulk of Stuart's work was not concerned with politics. But Barrington analyses the wartime broadcasts to prove that the overwhelming content of Stuart's output was heavily political. His propaganda talks included scathing denunciations of the last pre-war democratic Czech President Eduard Benes and a fantasy about German and Irish soldiers paying tribute to Sir Roger Casement's grave. But despite these latest revelations of anti-semitism and Hitler worship, Francis Stuart remains a Saoi or 'wise person', according to the Irish literary establishment.",

      "bodyText": "The secret love life of H.G. Wells, the titan of the early 20th-century literary world who was courted by politicians and statesmen throughout the world, was more complicated and controversial than the world has dared imagine. Thanks to a six-year investigation and the discovery of a treasure trove of previously suppressed material, a new book about to be published in the United States will prove that the writer's greatest love was a spy who relayed information revealed by his friends back to Russia with his knowledge. It will also reveal the identities of two previously unknown lovers, one of whom strenuously denied the love affair until the end of her life. In Shadow Lovers: The Last Affairs of H.G. Wells , author Andrea Lynn reveals how Moura Budberg, the Russian baroness who captured Wells's heart in the early 1930s, pretended to be in love with Wells to gain unfettered access to his wide and politically elevated circle of friends. Lynn also suggests that it was Budberg's influence that led to the meeting between Stalin and Wells, George Bernard Shaw, and Beatrice and Sidney Webb in 1934, after which the British visitors publicly praised the dictator and the Communist philosophy. 'Moura may also have been involved in counter-espionage,' said Lynn. 'It's impossible to tell exactly what was going on, because all her papers and files were destroyed in a convenient house fire, but from Wells's suppressed letters it's clear that something was happening and that, although he knew about it, his love for her made him powerless to leave or expose her.' The bouncy little man whose tiny hands and squeaky voice belied his success as the Don Juan of the intelligentsia, was loved by legions of beautiful women throughout his life, one of whom credited his phenomenal pulling power to the fact that his body smelt irresistably of honey. In an attempt to come clean about his amoratory experiences, Wells started work on his second autobiography, H.G. Wells in Love: Postscript to an Experiment in Autobiography, in 1934, immediately after the publication of his Experiment in Autobiography: Discoveries and Conclusions of a Very Ordinary Brain (Since 1866) . While his first autobiography steered clear of Wells's lively sex life, he used the second manuscript to explore his sexual adventures in detail. 'I have done what I pleased, so that every bit of sexual impulse in me has expressed itself,' he admitted in the book. 'This is my intimate diary and the story of my amatory life.' In accordance with his wishes that the expos\u00e9 would remain unpublished until after both his death and the deaths of the women concerned, Wells's eldest son and chief editor, George Wells, held the manuscript back until 1984, 38 years after Wells's death and a year after the death of Rebecca West, the mother of Wells's illegitimate son, Anthony West. Before the manuscript was finally published, George Wells excised large chunks of the text, including the names and details of two of Wells's last lovers, and his suspicions about Budberg's activities. 'H.G. had been extremely candid [in his second autobiography], though not X-rated,' said Lynn. 'The heirs, however, played it cautiously, their actions prompted by courtesy and concern over litigation. As well as removing pages and excising entire stories, the heirs also held back a huge cache of letters of a personal nature that H.G. received over the decades from the many women in his life ' In 1994 the Wells family sold the unexpurgated manuscript and more than 500 letters to the H.G. Wells Collection at the University of Illinois Library, but although Lynn - at the time a journalist attached to the university - publicised the sale, no Wellsian scholar came forward to investigate the contents of the collection. 'I couldn't believe that no one seemed interested,' she said. 'Then I suddenly remembered that I was a writer and researcher in my own right. 'What I have discovered blew me away. For six years I have managed to keep the things I have discovered secret. The effort was phenomenal: what I have uncovered will scandalise the literary world and change the face of Wellsian scholarship.' Wells was 68 and married to Jane, his second wife, when he met Moura Budberg. 'I think I have really loved only three women steadfastly,' he wrote in the Postscript . 'My first wife, my second wife and Moura Budberg.' But in letters to his close friend, Christabel McLaren, which have been suppressed for almost 70 years, Wells referred to 'the faint aroma of espionage of Moura's world in Berlin and Paris and Knightsbridge'. 'I'm tired, I'm bored by a Moura who...rambles round corners &amp; for all I know is a spy. I'm not going to be trailed,' he complained, referring to the interest the French government had developed in Moura's activities. 'She flits away to her old familiar gossips at 88 Knightsbridge, and to Berlin and Paris and Warsaw - and maybe even Moscow,' he added. Two years after the death of Wells's second wife in 1927, Budberg came to England and she and Wells resumed their affair. Although she refused to marry him - proving, according to her friends still alive today, that she was no spy - Lynn maintains that she refused to marry Wells because she was already in love with the British agent in Moscow, Bruce Lockhart. 'Although marriage to him would have given her the perfect protection, her relationship with Wells was work,' she said. According to further passages removed from Wells's original draft of his Postscript, his affair with Budberg was still in full fettle when he began his affair with Constance Coolidge and, less than a year later, with the 26-year-old Martha Gellhorn, 'relationships which have been totally unknown except to a few members of the family'. Wells met the American-born Coolidge, a French countess, in the South of France towards the end of 1934. Three of the nine pages Wells devoted to Coolidge in his Postscript were cut by his son, leaving no reference to her parents, husbands or lovers. Coolidge, who died in 1973, was devoted to Wells; alone among his lovers, Lynn believes, she offered him a disinterested and sincere affection. But the discovery that will scandalise the literary world is that when Martha Ellis Gellhorn and the 68-year-old Wells met over a meal at the Roosevelts' residence in 1935, they began a passionate affair that could have ended in marriage. Throughout her life, Gellhorn steadfastly denied rumours of an affair. 'I was probably the last journalist to speak to Martha before her death in 1998, and she told me again and again that there was nothing but friendship between them,' said Lynn. In pages suppressed from the Postscript, Wells is adamant that he and Gellhorn - who later married Ernest Hemingway not only became lovers but discussed marriage.

We discussed our future relationship but felt the manifest incompatibility of our ages.' The truth and extent of Budberg's espionage activities will probably never be known, but Gellhorn's letters to Wells - the missing piece of the jigsaw - were deposited at Boston University after her death. They will remain sealed until 2023, 25 years after her death. 'Until that day, we won't know for certain what the truth of their story is,' said Lynn.

      "body": "<p>Radiohead - the British rock band who have topped the album charts on both sides of the Atlantic - have attacked the BBC for keeping their music off the air. </p> <p>The reclusive Oxford-based band have criticised the 'safe' music that is commercially successful in this country and called for BBC radio to take up the challenge of their work. </p> <p>At best, they say, guitar music is now of 'average standard' and yet it takes up so much playtime that Radiohead are often 'excluded'. </p> <p>The comments were made by Colin and Jonny Greenwood, the band's bassist and guitarist, during an interview for the BBC's own Mixing It, a contemporary music show on Radio 3. Their contentious views are unlikely to make it into the final edit of the programme which goes out on 20 January. </p> <p>The Greenwood brothers' complaints echo those of other British rock stars who spoke out last autumn about their dissatisfaction with the 'phoney' world of pop music. Last October George Michael blamed the corporate takeover of youth culture for the 'rubbish' acts. </p> <p>He was promptly backed by Bono of U2, who criticised Steps and said people were 'sick to the teeth of processed and hyped pop bands. It's crap'. Even Blur weighed in to call chart music 'a load of shite'. </p> <p>Jonny Greenwood talks about the 'series of kickings' that Radiohead's recent album, Kid A, initially received from British critics. Despite this it sold 55,000 copies in its first day in the shops and then went in at No 1 in the US Billboard charts - the first time in three years a British act had done so. </p> <p>The experimental Radiohead album, which has been branded 'difficult' even by its fans, was also nominated last week for Grammy Awards in four categories. </p> <p>But, in this country, the Greenwoods argue that radio station 'demographics' are preventing serious rock music from being heard. 'I heard the controller of Radio 1 say the demographic for their station is now 14 or 15 to 25, so I think we are kind of excluded. It is getting harder for our music to be heard,' said Colin Greenwood. </p> <p>'It is the nature of the times we are in,' the Cambridge-educated musician adds.

      "bodyText": "Radiohead - the British rock band who have topped the album charts on both sides of the Atlantic - have attacked the BBC for keeping their music off the air. The reclusive Oxford-based band have criticised the 'safe' music that is commercially successful in this country and called for BBC radio to take up the challenge of their work. At best, they say, guitar music is now of 'average standard' and yet it takes up so much playtime that Radiohead are often 'excluded'. The comments were made by Colin and Jonny Greenwood, the band's bassist and guitarist, during an interview for the BBC's own Mixing It, a contemporary music show on Radio 3. Their contentious views are unlikely to make it into the final edit of the programme which goes out on 20 January. The Greenwood brothers' complaints echo those of other British rock stars who spoke out last autumn about their dissatisfaction with the 'phoney' world of pop music. Last October George Michael blamed the corporate takeover of youth culture for the 'rubbish' acts. He was promptly backed by Bono of U2, who criticised Steps and said people were 'sick to the teeth of processed and hyped pop bands. It's crap'. Even Blur weighed in to call chart music 'a load of shite'. Jonny Greenwood talks about the 'series of kickings' that Radiohead's recent album, Kid A, initially received from British critics. Despite this it sold 55,000 copies in its first day in the shops and then went in at No 1 in the US Billboard charts - the first time in three years a British act had done so. The experimental Radiohead album, which has been branded 'difficult' even by its fans, was also nominated last week for Grammy Awards in four categories. But, in this country, the Greenwoods argue that radio station 'demographics' are preventing serious rock music from being heard. 'I heard the controller of Radio 1 say the demographic for their station is now 14 or 15 to 25, so I think we are kind of excluded. It is getting harder for our music to be heard,' said Colin Greenwood. 'It is the nature of the times we are in,' the Cambridge-educated musician adds. 'Other artists of considerable stature launched albums in the past few months only to see them drop out of the top twenties and thirties two weeks later.' Radio 1 says it simply has a commitment to new sounds. But Radiohead's harsh words come at a time when the BBC is facing up to a huge gap in its range of targeted audiences. The corporation now has no radio station which is aimed at rock and pop music-lovers in their late twenties and thirties. While Radio 2 has adopted an increasingly youthward path by introducing Jonathan Ross, Jools Holland, Mark Lamarr and Steve Wright as presenters, its lower audience age profile still only reaches down to those in their late 40s. Last summer Radio 2 schedulers commissioned a series about punk rock in an effort to confound expectations. Hosted by the former Sex Pistol, Glen Matlock, and called Anarchy In the UK, it was a hit with younger listeners. So it is Radio 3, the classical music station, that is left to make the BBC's most positive moves towards listeners in their thirties. The station was quick to pick up the world music presenter Andy Kershaw when he was edged out of Radio 1 last year. 'The difficulty is that age profiling is a fairly crude way of working out your listenership. After all, rock itself is around 50 years old now anyway,' Kershaw said. 'I know my old show on Radio 1 had a wide age range of listeners and I hope the BBC will return to the idea of surprising its audiences a little.' Kershaw's new show on Radio 3 starts in April and is part of a concerted drive to add more jazz and world music to its schedule. The BBC's controller of Radio and Music, Jenny Abramsky, plans to launch five additional digital networks this year and one of them, which is codenamed Network Y, is to be devoted to this missing age group, the thirty-somethings or Generation Y. 'I imagine that Radiohead will be right at the core of this new digital station's playlist,' said a spokeswoman for Radio 2.

Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is set during the Qing Dynasty, a period in the early nineteenth century before the European commercial invasion that is regarded as something of a golden age.

I like my karate in short, isolated bursts - Spencer Tracy taking on Ernest Borgnine in Bad Day at Black Rock, for instance, or Frank Sinatra engaging with Henry Silva in The Manchurian Candidate. Until now, the only martial arts picture I've really loved is King Hu's classic A Touch of Zen (1969), but the fights in Ang Lee's film are breathtaking in their beauty. </p> <p>These action sequences are choreographed by Yuen Wo Ping, who staged the chases and battles in Jackie Chan's Hong Kong flicks, and more recently worked in America on The Matrix. Though long drawn out, they never get tedious and each is quite different in character and contributes to the dramatic development. As in dreams, the combatants defy gravity, flying through the air, running up walls, quite literally floating like butterflies and stinging like bees.</p> <p>Four of these fights stand out. In the first, a masked Jen steals the Green Destiny sword and (resembling the young female cat burglar in Hitchcock's To Catch a Thief) is chased through the night over the rooftops of Beijing by the older woman, Yu. The two later have a graceful fight indoors for possession of the sword.</p> <p>In the film's last big fight, Jen fights in a forest of giant bamboo trees with the mature warrior, Yi, a scene with echoes of the climactic confrontation between the good and bad brothers who conduct a moral argument as they exchange gunfire in Anthony Mann's Winchester 73. But as they bounce from the top of one tree to another swinging their lethal swords, it seems as if we're looking at Nijinsky playing a combination of Tarzan and D'Artagnan. </p> <p>Jen has another scene, as cleverly staged as the others, but wonderfully comic, in which she takes on a succession of overweight braggarts in a country inn. They underestimate her martial skills as much as they overrate their own and they end up in tatters and the inn is demolished. It's a fight that would have won the admiration of John Ford. One mentions Ford, but his women stood by and watched as their men went into action. Few westerns have provided female roles like the ones so confidently played here by Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi, and it could be argued that no western has provided so persuasive a context. </p> <p>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is the first foreign language picture for many years to get a sizeable release in British cinemas, and the first ever to do so in a non-European language.

      "body": "<p>In the subtitle to his book, Getting Away With It, Steven Soderbergh refers to himself as the 'luckiest bastard you ever saw'. Right now, it would be hard to disagree. The stars love him. 'I want to be in all of his movies,' Julia Roberts said recently. His partner in the production company Section Eight is George Clooney. And his next film, the Rat Pack remake, Ocean's Eleven, is set to star Clooney, Roberts, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Ralph Fiennes.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Soderbergh's biggest competition at this year's Oscars may well be himself: both Erin Brockovich and his new film, Traffic, are contenders and both have picked up Golden Globe nominations for best picture and best director. The New York Times critic A.O. Scott wrote of Traffic: 'A director who began his career with a deft chamber piece has now at last attempted a symphony. Is it a populist art film or an especially arty popular movie? Is Mr Soderbergh an independent who has infiltrated Hollywood, or was he always a mainstream director in maverick's clothing? Such questions are based on rather wobbly distinctions, the kind Mr Soderbergh, early on, seemed likely to uphold. Now, at the top of his game, he may help to abolish them, which would be good news indeed.'</p> <p>'The last time a filmmaker released two films in a year this way was Steven Spielberg when he did Jurassic Park and Schindler's List,' points out Faber &amp; Faber's Walter Donohue, who edited Getting Away With It. 'It is very rare. It has to do with the mastery Steven now has with the cinematic medium, and also his mastery of working with actors.'</p> <p>Four years ago, things couldn't have been more different. Soderbergh was widely regarded as a busted flush, a prodigy who was never going to repeat the shock success of his debut, sex, lies, and videotape, having followed it with a string of interesting flops. He was struggling to get any distributor to take his micro-budgeted, bizarre and autobiographical Schizopolis, and locked in litigation over his attempt to film John Kennedy Toole's cult novel, Confederacy of Dunces. His personal life was a shambles, the split with his wife, actress Betsy Brantley, possibly accelerated by having her and their daughter appear in Schizopolis.</p> <p>Since then, he has managed a miraculous return to grace, balancing a growing contacts book with an uncompromising reputation. He followed Out Of Sight, the Clooney-Jennifer Lopez romantic thriller that revived his career, with the supremely fractured revenge movie, The Limey, in which Terence Stamp talks almost entirely in rhyming slang. After Ocean's Eleven will come Son of Schizopolis ('I just thought it would be great to take a film that no one's seen and make a sequel'). </p> <p>And then there's Traffic. Superficially, it might seem a solid commercial venture, with a cast including Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones. But this examination of the war on drugs - loosely based on a Channel 4 mini-series - starts in the Mexican desert, with subtitled conversations and much confusion. The film is shot entirely with handheld cameras, lasts 2 hours 20 and has dozens of characters. The audience's main guide is visual: the three storylines are filmed through different coloured filters. It covers the spectrum of the drugs war, from Washington cocktail parties (featuring real politicians expounding their real positions) to big houses bought with drug profits to crack houses and informal torture chambers south of the border. </p> <p>It is a massively ambitious film, a piece of fiction filled with real incidents, real statistics and real people. Gary Ross, who wrote and directed Pleasantville, which Soderbergh produced, says: 'Traffic is so good it's being drawn to the attention of a lot of people who wouldn't see that kind of movie. I think this a perfect fusion of form and content. Steven has disappeared more and more into naturalism, removing all marks of the filmmaker.' </p> <p>Traffic links back to the political cinema of the Sixties and Seventies. In its combination of radical form and content, it is reminiscent of Medium Cool and, most of all, The Battle of Algiers. Like Pontecorvo's revolutionary classic, Traffic has both a broad scope and a sharp immediacy. With other filmmakers, these comparisons would be speculative, but Soderbergh is the biggest film buff among current American directors, a man who actually described The Limey as 'Alain Resnais directing Get Carter'.</p> <p>There are lots of curious things about Soderbergh's biography, not least that he comes from the South - born in Atlanta (1963) and raised in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, after an early childhood in Texas, Virginia and Pennsylvania - not places you'd expect to find someone growing up to be a left-winger, let alone an atheist. He even prefers cold weather to hot. His parents, he has said, were never compatible - his father, a professor at Louisiana State University, was a fiercely practical man while his mother had New Age interests. They split when he was 16 and Steven was always closer to his father. </p> <p>He is clearly something of an intellectual but didn't go to college, opting instead for an early start in Hollywood, having spent his teens making Super-8 films. It didn't work out: he hated LA and came home after 18 months. He took a job in a video arcade, making the long commute to occasional editing jobs in LA. This ultimately led him to direct a tour film for rock dinosaurs Yes. </p> <p>This was also Soderbergh's admitted 'self-destructive' phase: he was drinking heavily, sleeping around and lying a lot. 'I behaved really badly,' he said later. But his immersion in deception - he was carrying on with three women at once - formed the basis for sex, lies, and videotape, the $1.2 million indie movie that won the Palme D'Or at Cannes, made $25m and briefly threatened to turn the film world upside down, leading thousands of suburban Americans to believe they too could make films.</p> <p>'Whether Soderbergh likes it or not, he changed the industry landscape,' wrote John Pierson in his book Spike Mike Slackers &amp; Dykes. 'sex, lies, and videotape showed just how far a first feature, an independent no less, could go all over the world.' </p> <p>The film's continuing stylistic influence is visible in American Beauty, but its deeper impact was the sense of possibility it created. Soderbergh was still only 26. But his fall seemed equally swift. Given $11m, Soderbergh went to Prague and made Kafka, a black-and-white comedy thriller starring Jeremy Irons that conflated the author's life and work. The critics demolished it. Soderbergh now admits it was too 'cold'. Reacting against his own film, he made King of the Hill, a coming-of-age story set during the Depression. It had none of Kafka's faults, but was too low key to get noticed. Then he made The Underneath, a film noir which he admits he thought was a disaster while he was making it. 'I disconnected so far from the excitement that made me want to make movies.'</p> <p>Then he started writing Getting Away With It. 'Steven wanted to do a book that was centred on a conversation between himself and Richard Lester [the veteran film director],' Walter Donohue explains. 'In the course of the year of writing the book, he went off and did Schizopolis which was done very much in what now would be called the Dogme style. And the exuberance and freedom he found in making that film very much prepared him for the films he has done subsequently.'</p> <p>Gary Ross doesn't buy into the idea of Soderbergh's lost years. 'Steven never seemed dormant to any of us. He would go off and direct a play in Baton Rouge, or make Schizopolis with his own money.

      "bodyText": "In the subtitle to his book, Getting Away With It, Steven Soderbergh refers to himself as the 'luckiest bastard you ever saw'. Right now, it would be hard to disagree. The stars love him. 'I want to be in all of his movies,' Julia Roberts said recently. His partner in the production company Section Eight is George Clooney. And his next film, the Rat Pack remake, Ocean's Eleven, is set to star Clooney, Roberts, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Ralph Fiennes. Meanwhile, Soderbergh's biggest competition at this year's Oscars may well be himself: both Erin Brockovich and his new film, Traffic, are contenders and both have picked up Golden Globe nominations for best picture and best director. The New York Times critic A.O. Scott wrote of Traffic: 'A director who began his career with a deft chamber piece has now at last attempted a symphony. Is it a populist art film or an especially arty popular movie? Is Mr Soderbergh an independent who has infiltrated Hollywood, or was he always a mainstream director in maverick's clothing? Such questions are based on rather wobbly distinctions, the kind Mr Soderbergh, early on, seemed likely to uphold. Now, at the top of his game, he may help to abolish them, which would be good news indeed.' 'The last time a filmmaker released two films in a year this way was Steven Spielberg when he did Jurassic Park and Schindler's List,' points out Faber &amp; Faber's Walter Donohue, who edited Getting Away With It. 'It is very rare. It has to do with the mastery Steven now has with the cinematic medium, and also his mastery of working with actors.' Four years ago, things couldn't have been more different. Soderbergh was widely regarded as a busted flush, a prodigy who was never going to repeat the shock success of his debut, sex, lies, and videotape, having followed it with a string of interesting flops. He was struggling to get any distributor to take his micro-budgeted, bizarre and autobiographical Schizopolis, and locked in litigation over his attempt to film John Kennedy Toole's cult novel, Confederacy of Dunces. His personal life was a shambles, the split with his wife, actress Betsy Brantley, possibly accelerated by having her and their daughter appear in Schizopolis. Since then, he has managed a miraculous return to grace, balancing a growing contacts book with an uncompromising reputation. He followed Out Of Sight, the Clooney-Jennifer Lopez romantic thriller that revived his career, with the supremely fractured revenge movie, The Limey, in which Terence Stamp talks almost entirely in rhyming slang. After Ocean's Eleven will come Son of Schizopolis ('I just thought it would be great to take a film that no one's seen and make a sequel'). And then there's Traffic. Superficially, it might seem a solid commercial venture, with a cast including Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones. But this examination of the war on drugs - loosely based on a Channel 4 mini-series - starts in the Mexican desert, with subtitled conversations and much confusion. The film is shot entirely with handheld cameras, lasts 2 hours 20 and has dozens of characters. The audience's main guide is visual: the three storylines are filmed through different coloured filters. It covers the spectrum of the drugs war, from Washington cocktail parties (featuring real politicians expounding their real positions) to big houses bought with drug profits to crack houses and informal torture chambers south of the border. It is a massively ambitious film, a piece of fiction filled with real incidents, real statistics and real people. Gary Ross, who wrote and directed Pleasantville, which Soderbergh produced, says: 'Traffic is so good it's being drawn to the attention of a lot of people who wouldn't see that kind of movie. I think this a perfect fusion of form and content. Steven has disappeared more and more into naturalism, removing all marks of the filmmaker.' Traffic links back to the political cinema of the Sixties and Seventies. In its combination of radical form and content, it is reminiscent of Medium Cool and, most of all, The Battle of Algiers. Like Pontecorvo's revolutionary classic, Traffic has both a broad scope and a sharp immediacy. With other filmmakers, these comparisons would be speculative, but Soderbergh is the biggest film buff among current American directors, a man who actually described The Limey as 'Alain Resnais directing Get Carter'. There are lots of curious things about Soderbergh's biography, not least that he comes from the South - born in Atlanta (1963) and raised in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, after an early childhood in Texas, Virginia and Pennsylvania - not places you'd expect to find someone growing up to be a left-winger, let alone an atheist. He even prefers cold weather to hot. His parents, he has said, were never compatible - his father, a professor at Louisiana State University, was a fiercely practical man while his mother had New Age interests. They split when he was 16 and Steven was always closer to his father. He is clearly something of an intellectual but didn't go to college, opting instead for an early start in Hollywood, having spent his teens making Super-8 films. It didn't work out: he hated LA and came home after 18 months. He took a job in a video arcade, making the long commute to occasional editing jobs in LA. This ultimately led him to direct a tour film for rock dinosaurs Yes. This was also Soderbergh's admitted 'self-destructive' phase: he was drinking heavily, sleeping around and lying a lot. 'I behaved really badly,' he said later. But his immersion in deception - he was carrying on with three women at once - formed the basis for sex, lies, and videotape, the $1.2 million indie movie that won the Palme D'Or at Cannes, made $25m and briefly threatened to turn the film world upside down, leading thousands of suburban Americans to believe they too could make films. 'Whether Soderbergh likes it or not, he changed the industry landscape,' wrote John Pierson in his book Spike Mike Slackers &amp; Dykes. 'sex, lies, and videotape showed just how far a first feature, an independent no less, could go all over the world.' The film's continuing stylistic influence is visible in American Beauty, but its deeper impact was the sense of possibility it created. Soderbergh was still only 26. But his fall seemed equally swift. Given $11m, Soderbergh went to Prague and made Kafka, a black-and-white comedy thriller starring Jeremy Irons that conflated the author's life and work. The critics demolished it. Soderbergh now admits it was too 'cold'. Reacting against his own film, he made King of the Hill, a coming-of-age story set during the Depression. It had none of Kafka's faults, but was too low key to get noticed. Then he made The Underneath, a film noir which he admits he thought was a disaster while he was making it. 'I disconnected so far from the excitement that made me want to make movies.' Then he started writing Getting Away With It. 'Steven wanted to do a book that was centred on a conversation between himself and Richard Lester [the veteran film director],' Walter Donohue explains. 'In the course of the year of writing the book, he went off and did Schizopolis which was done very much in what now would be called the Dogme style. And the exuberance and freedom he found in making that film very much prepared him for the films he has done subsequently.' Gary Ross doesn't buy into the idea of Soderbergh's lost years. 'Steven never seemed dormant to any of us. He would go off and direct a play in Baton Rouge, or make Schizopolis with his own money. And when you make a movie for $5,000 or whatever, the criteria of success should be different. I wouldn't say he wandered through the wilderness; I'd say he took an interesting hike through it.' He initially turned down the chance to direct Out of Sight, largely because he was trying to make Human Nature, based on a typically bizarre script by Being John Malkovich writer Charlie Kaufman. Eventually he relented, and the film's sizzling Clooney-Lopez partnership suddenly returned Soderbergh to the mainstream. So what it is it that makes this geeky, self-questioning man so popular with the glossiest people on the planet? By all accounts, Soderbergh is a nice guy. And Ross adds: 'He's also very funny. I'd love to see Steven do an all-out comedy one day because he is a riot.' 'He's completely wonderful to work with,' Donohue says. 'He trusts his instincts, and the work he produces has his stamp of identity on it.' 'He's clear about his point of view,' says Ross, 'and he's in control without being overbearing. Like all people who know what they are doing, he gives everyone else around him tremendous credit for their own expertise.' What is certain is that he brings out the best in actors. The example always cited is Andie MacDowell appearing able to act in sex, lies, and videotape. But consider also such variable talents as Jennifer Lopez in Out of Sight or Terence Stamp in The Limey.Yet Soderbergh's affinity for actors is not at the expense of other components of the director's craft: he has a great eye for colour, and on Traffic he doubled as the cinematographer.

According to Professor Keith Hawton of the Centre for Suicide Research in Oxford, girls largely account for the increase in non-fatal overdoses and self-inflicted injuries. They outnumber boys by at least six to one. In most cases, children are sending out the simple message: 'I feel so bad I could die.' Psychologists, who previously thought the concept of death was understood by an individual at puberty, now believe it can develop far earlier in stressed children, at around seven or eight. Kelly Yeomans, 13, took an overdose of her mother's painkillers in 1997 to end an 18-month bullying campaign against her. 'We keep going over the same question: \"Why didn't she tell somebody?\"' her mother Julie said then. Only months later 15-year-old choirboy Darren Steele's mother asked the same question when her son hanged himself just weeks away from sitting his GCSEs. In 1996 two schoolgirls were jailed, branded by the judge 'contemptible and cowardly', after the overdose death of 16-year-old Scots schoolgirl Katherine Jane Morrison. One of the most heart-rending cases was that of the 13-year-old Manchester schoolboy Vijay Singh whose parents found the following entries in his diary in 1997: 'Monday: My money was taken. Tuesday: Names called. Wednesday: Uniform torn. Thursday: My body pouring with blood. Friday: It's ended. Saturday: Freedom.' Saturday was the day Vijay was found dead, hanging from the banister of his home by a silk scarf. tracy.mcveigh@observer.co.uk",

      "bodyText": "Martin is 20 but he claims he already knows what will kill him. The science student is one of those touched by the fastest growing epidemic in the UK - depression. And it is depression, he says, that will claim his life. Mental illness has reached unprecedented levels in the UK according to research obtained by The Observer. A survey of Britain's students shows that 46 per cent of men and 64 per cent of women show symptoms of the illness and that mental health problems are overwhelming student health services. This compares to levels reported in 1987 where between 1 and 25 per cent of students showed significant emotional disturbance. 'It seems that poor mental health is becoming more prevalent and more severe,' said Pauline Fox of Thames Valley University who conducted the research for the Mental Health Foundation. She said the findings were cause for the deepest concern. 'Undoubtedly students are in poor mental shape and counselling services are unable to cope with the volume,' she added. For Martin counselling was never an option. He went to his GP and was given anti-depressants. These are currently prescribed 20 million times a year - a 700 per cent increase in 10 years. Government figures show that on any day around 33 per cent of patients who visit their GP report symptoms of depression whether they recognise them or not. 'I had money and girlfriend troubles and exam worries and I wasn't sleeping,' said Martin. 'It took a while for me to accept that what I had was actually a mental illness. It took me even longer to recognise it wasn't an embarrassment. I'm told now that I should come off the pills and try therapy,' he said. 'But although I will, and I feel a lot better than before I took the medication, I understand why people say depression kills. I know it will be the death of me sooner or later and I've got to get along with that somehow.' Depression and related suicide, suicidal behaviours and substance misuse have all increased among people in the general population. According to Department of Health figures, around 20 per cent of women and 14 per cent of men in England suffer from depression at any one time but the Mental Health Foundation had estimated the true figure to be higher with symptoms affecting one in four UK adults. Now the foundation's latest research will concern experts by showing what Fox called 'an alarming overview' of an illness which is still so severely stigmatised that, as studies show, employers would rather give a job to an ex-convict than to someone who admits to having ever suffered from depression. 'It is arguable whether these figures reflect the population at large or whether the tide is rising higher and faster among students,' said Fox. 'The student population is far greater and made up of a far wider spectrum of people than ever before and the pressures are higher with people having to work very hard outside university to make money. There is evidence that their general health is poorer than non-students.' The epidemic of depression is spreading so fast that it has been estimated it will overtake heart disease, Aids, malaria and malnutrition to become the second most common killer in the world after cancer within 20 years. 'These are alarming statistics,' said Professor Jeffrey Gray of the Institute of Psychiatry. 'What one must remember is that depression not only kills through suicide but also leads to an early death in other ways. 'It changes the structure of the brain and there is evidence now that links it to cancer, infectious diseases, premature ageing and undoubtedly dementia. 'We are designed to cope with acute stres, the kind that would see someone running from a lion. But modern stress is prolonged and evolution has not designed us to cope with that.' According to the World Health Organisation, depression is number five in the top 10 list of disabling illness and it is expected that the WHO's latest worldwide figures, to be released in June, will show a further increase. Recent studies in the US suggest that upwards of 40 per cent of the US population will suffer from mental illness in their lifetime. Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, Director-General of WHO, is making mental health a priority for 2001 with political action being urged to contain the epidemic. 'What is needed in the mental health arena is less exclusion and more care,' she said. 'This will be demonstrated by dismantling common myths about mental disorders and addressing the problem of discrimination.' An unpublished report by the Association of University and College Counselling, seen by The Observer, further exposes the crisis of mental illness among students. It reveals that 12 per cent of students at established universities contact the counselling service at some point during their student life, a rise of 25 per cent since 1996. Around 4.7 per cent of students in higher education receive counselling but the services are being cut due to funding problems just as the demand is rising. tracy.mcveigh@observer.co.uk",

Scientists now want to find planets like Earth, which are too small for the present technology to detect. This should change with the launch in 2004 of the first satellite designed to hunt for Earth-like worlds. Corot, a French-led European Space Agency project, will have 'the time and ability to detect planets around twice the size of the Earth', said Deeg, who helped design Corot and works at the Astrophysics Institute in Tenerife.",

      "bodyText": "Scotland's beleaguered fish farming industry is facing a crisis as the European Commission considers measures to prevent contamination of farmed salmon by cancer-causing toxic chemicals. The Observer has learnt that Brussels is likely to act this month to slash the permissible levels of toxin contamination in fishmeal and oil pellets amid growing evidence that, potentially, they pose a threat to human health. The development comes in the wake of a row over a BBC2 wildlife documentary to be screened tonight. It will reignite concerns about the health and environmental impact of fish farming, an industry worth \u00a3300 million to the Scottish economy, providing jobs for 6,500 people. Last week, a BBC news story claimed the documentary had discovered research that showed farmed salmon carried up to 10 times the levels of dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBS) than their wild counterparts. The story provoked a furious reaction from the aquaculture industry and from the scientist credited with carrying out the research, who accused the BBC of misinterpreting her findings. The Food Standards Agency, which lambasted the BBC for creating a food scare, insisted there was no evidence to suggest farmed salmon were more at risk of contamination than wild fish. But The Observer has established that Brussels believes the problem is more serious than the British authorities would suggest. At a meeting to take place this month, the Commission will consider a proposal to cut dioxin limits in fish feed after an investigation by an EU scientific committee. The concern focuses on the tiny feed pellets, made from the rendered-down remains of small fish, that make up 75 per cent of the diet of farmed carniverous fish such as salmon. Trace levels of dioxins, a by-product of industrial incineration, and PCBs, man-made contaminants that were banned in Britain 30 years ago, can be found throughout the food chain, including in wild fish. But the latest EU research found fishmeal and oil carried the greatest contamination of all animal feeds, raising the possibility of toxins crossing into the human food chain. 'As farmed fish combines an important consumption of feed materials of fish origin (up to 75 per cent in the diet of carnivorous species) with a high level of contamination of these feed materials, it is the food-producing animal most exposed to dioxins,' the Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition said in a report handed to the European Commission last November. Another group of experts, the Scientific Committee on Food, found that fish and fish products were the main contributors to exposure to dioxin contamination, ahead of dairy and meat products. The concentration of dioxin-related compounds in fish and fish products was 10 times the level found in other foodstuffs. The EU last month lowered its weekly tolerable limit of intake of these compounds. A Commission official said: 'This is a serious problem and I think the solution will be a cut in dioxin limits. This is a big industry...but the Commission will put public health first when it makes its decision.' The fishmeal and fishfarming industries are bracing themselves for tough action. Stuart Barlow, chief executive of the UK-based International Fishmeal and Oil Manufacturers Association, said the $750m-a-year European meal industry would be devastated by a drastic cut in the dioxin limits. 'If it is a big cut then we will be in serious trouble and so will the fish farmers because they will have nothing to feed their fish,' he said. The BBC2 documentary, Warnings from the Wild: The price of salmon, also contains claims that government scientists were told they would lose their jobs if they spoke out about the impact of fish farming on wild salmon stocks. The Scottish Executive has denied the claims.",

      "bodyText": "William Hague is facing an exodus of senior Tories after the next election as dispirited Shadow Cabinet members plan a return to the backbenches. Several are gloomy at the prospect of another five gruelling years in opposition if, as expected, Labour is returned to power. Party chairman Michael Ancram, once spoken of as a potential leader, is thought likely to leave the Shadow Cabinet if the Tories lose again. Ancram has been repeatedly attacked by colleagues for indecision and his enemies would quickly blame him for a defeat. Friends say the former Minister Angela Browning, once the most senior woman on Hague's team but recently reshuffled into obscurity as Shadow Leader of the Commons, is also prepared to return to the backbenches. Colleagues believe Francis Maude, the Shadow Foreign Secretary who has trodden a difficult path sniped at by both left and right in the party, will also go if Hague stays on as leader after the election. Maude insisted last night that he was expecting the party to win, adding: 'I am not making any plans on the basis of losing the election. I expect to be in the next Tory government.' But colleagues argue that having had a lucrative career in the City before politics, he would be in demand for directorships as a backbench MP. Colleagues complain that Hague lacks the ability to motivate his team, demoralised by the Tories' unpopularity in the polls. A self-reliant man himself, the Tory leader does not realise others need encouragement and praise, they complain, while Shadow Chancellor Michael Portillo is described as 'aloof and distant'. 'There is likely to be something of a clearout after the next election,' said one Shadow Cabinet member. 'People are feeling a bit depressed to be honest. No man is an island, except William Hague, and we need some feedback. Too often we are not working as a team.' The exodus could, however, make room for talent from the junior ranks. Candidates for promotion include the cerebral ex-banker Oliver Letwin, on the Treasury team; Ann Widdecombe's deputy David Lidington; and environment spokesman Damian Green, although his pro-European views may hold him back. Any reshuffle will be studied for how it shifts the balance between so-called 'Mods and Rockers' in the party - socially liberal modernisers versus traditionalists. The two sides are currently locking horns over the tax proposals that will form the core of the Tory manifesto. Although Hague is committed to restoring some form of married couples' allowance, aides are stressing it will not be a simple case of replacing the universal benefit scrapped by Labour. The Shadow Cabinet is braced for a row over the proposals drawn up by Portillo and social security spokesman David Willetts, which would only benefit couples where one stays at home to look after children or disabled relatives. Under the plan, the non-working partner could transfer their unused tax allowance of \u00a34,500 a year to the working spouse, letting the breadwinner earn twice as much before tax. But the package has infuriated traditionalists. 'Some in the party want a straightforward married couple's allowance in the form it used to exist,' said another Shadow Cabinet member. 'Their argument is that marriage is a social contract in its own right regardless of whether or not you have got children and you shouldn't be reaching fine judgments between different marriages.' A final decision on the options will not be taken until next month at the earliest. Options for Hague to consider include restricting the perk to parents of under-fives; restricting it to parents of under-11s; or to all married couples with children.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The death of the ageing ox in San Diego zoo in 1993 was greeted as a biological catastrophe by conservationists. The animal - a member of an endangered South-east Asian sub-species known as a gaur - had died without fathering offspring. Its precious genes, crucial to maintaining the viability of dwindling gaur herds, had been eradicated. Or so it seemed. </p> <p>All had not been lost, however - a point that will be dramatically demonstrated in a few days when a clone of the long-dead gaur is born to Bessie, a regular American cow, on a farm near Sioux City, in Iowa. </p> <p>The animal's resurrection is a scientific milestone: it raises hopes that potentially unlimited numbers of endangered creatures could one day be created, generating arks of threatened or extinct species, including pandas, rhinos, and wildcats. Appropriately, the baby gaur will be called Noah. </p> <p>'We have shown that domestic animals can be used as surrogate mothers for clones of endangered sibling species,' said Noah's creator, Dr Phil Damiani, of the US biotech firm, Advanced Cell Technologies (ACT). 'We now have a new weapon in the fight against animal extinctions.' </p> <p>According to theory, scientists need only save a few cells of an endangered animal; use one to create a cloned embryo; stick this in the womb of a similar domestic species, and in a few months, a rare wildcat or antelope will be born. </p> <p>Even better, cells from the preserved corpse of an extinct animal could be use to breath life into an entire species. Scientists at ACT, in collaboration with conservationists at the Ordesa National Park in Spain, have already begun work on cells taken from the body of the last bucardo, a Spanish mountain goat. The aim is to create a clone which would be placed in the womb of an Ibex, a closely related species. </p> <p>The key development in this technology is not the use of cross-species embryo implantations, however. The technique may appear dramatic but has already been used to persuade horses to give birth to zebras, and common antelopes to bear rarer sister species. What really excites scientists is the use of cloning in the gaur clone's creation, for it means that no risky operations had to be carried out to remove eggs from its mother's womb - a crucial advantage when dealing with a highly endangered species. </p> <p>'We used a technique very similar to that used in the creation of Dolly the sheep,' said Damiani. 'We took an egg from a domestic cow and removed its nucleus, the bit that contains its genes. Then we fused this empty egg with a single gaur cell, creating a gaur embryo that was immunologically acceptable to its surrogate cow mother.' </p> <p>As a result of this work, it should now be possible to produce endangered animals merely by collecting a few sample cells - say from saliva, hair or blood - which can then be used to generate new animals. At least, that's the theory. Several serious obstacles still have to be overcome. </p> <p>For a start, Noah's conception was certainly not without difficulty. He is the only survivor of a total of 690 attempts to create embryos from the cells of its 'father'. Only 30 were sufficiently robust to transfer to surrogate cows, and from these only eight pregnancies were achieved. Noah is the only one of these that has gone to term. 'We believe he is healthy, but cannot be sure until after he has been born,' added Damiani. </p> <p>Then there is the question of surrogate mothers.

      "bodyText": "The death of the ageing ox in San Diego zoo in 1993 was greeted as a biological catastrophe by conservationists. The animal - a member of an endangered South-east Asian sub-species known as a gaur - had died without fathering offspring. Its precious genes, crucial to maintaining the viability of dwindling gaur herds, had been eradicated. Or so it seemed. All had not been lost, however - a point that will be dramatically demonstrated in a few days when a clone of the long-dead gaur is born to Bessie, a regular American cow, on a farm near Sioux City, in Iowa. The animal's resurrection is a scientific milestone: it raises hopes that potentially unlimited numbers of endangered creatures could one day be created, generating arks of threatened or extinct species, including pandas, rhinos, and wildcats. Appropriately, the baby gaur will be called Noah. 'We have shown that domestic animals can be used as surrogate mothers for clones of endangered sibling species,' said Noah's creator, Dr Phil Damiani, of the US biotech firm, Advanced Cell Technologies (ACT). 'We now have a new weapon in the fight against animal extinctions.' According to theory, scientists need only save a few cells of an endangered animal; use one to create a cloned embryo; stick this in the womb of a similar domestic species, and in a few months, a rare wildcat or antelope will be born. Even better, cells from the preserved corpse of an extinct animal could be use to breath life into an entire species. Scientists at ACT, in collaboration with conservationists at the Ordesa National Park in Spain, have already begun work on cells taken from the body of the last bucardo, a Spanish mountain goat. The aim is to create a clone which would be placed in the womb of an Ibex, a closely related species. The key development in this technology is not the use of cross-species embryo implantations, however. The technique may appear dramatic but has already been used to persuade horses to give birth to zebras, and common antelopes to bear rarer sister species. What really excites scientists is the use of cloning in the gaur clone's creation, for it means that no risky operations had to be carried out to remove eggs from its mother's womb - a crucial advantage when dealing with a highly endangered species. 'We used a technique very similar to that used in the creation of Dolly the sheep,' said Damiani. 'We took an egg from a domestic cow and removed its nucleus, the bit that contains its genes. Then we fused this empty egg with a single gaur cell, creating a gaur embryo that was immunologically acceptable to its surrogate cow mother.' As a result of this work, it should now be possible to produce endangered animals merely by collecting a few sample cells - say from saliva, hair or blood - which can then be used to generate new animals. At least, that's the theory. Several serious obstacles still have to be overcome. For a start, Noah's conception was certainly not without difficulty. He is the only survivor of a total of 690 attempts to create embryos from the cells of its 'father'. Only 30 were sufficiently robust to transfer to surrogate cows, and from these only eight pregnancies were achieved. Noah is the only one of these that has gone to term. 'We believe he is healthy, but cannot be sure until after he has been born,' added Damiani. Then there is the question of surrogate mothers. For a gaur, this is not a problem since the species is so genetically similar to domestic cattle. Other rare creatures are not so well-blessed, or well-connected. Take the panda. 'It is the only member of its genus,' said Damiani. 'It has no close cousins and no obvious candidates for surrogate mothers. The closest species to it is the bear. However, we will need some major advances in immunology before we can think of persuading a bear to accept a panda embryo.' And finally, there is the problem of sex, a vexed issue demonstrated neatly by ACT's work on the bucardo. Its last representative on Earth - killed last year when struck by a falling tree - was female. Clones from this animal will therefore be female as well. A herd made up of nothing but lady bucardos suffers an obvious reproductive problem. 'Once we have cloned bucardos we will have to look at ways of creating males,' said Damiani. 'That means finding a method of adding Y chromosomes to embryos and again that is something that will require major advances in biology.' Nevertheless, the birth of Noah in a few days does offer some species a precious lifeline. In particular, it suggests that it should be possible to improve the genetic diversity of zoo populations merely by sending in blood samples from which new creatures can be cloned. Already zoos such as San Diego's are stockpiling cells from African wild cats, blackfooted cats, various gazelles and other antelopes - animals fortunate enough to possess close domestic relations that could then act as surrogate hosts. 'Cloning is certainly not the answer to animal extinctions,' admitted Damiani. 'However it is a powerful new weapon.' robin.mckie@observer.co.uk",

      "bodyText": "Radioactive dust from depleted uranium weapons remains in the atmosphere at potentially dangerous levels for up to a decade after their use. Research by British expert Dr Chris Busby emerged as Italy's military watchdog officially linked the leukemia deaths of five Italian peacekeepers who served in Kosovo to exposure to the heavy metal. The results of tests by Dr Busby on Gulf War battlefields contradicts advice produced by British, American and Nato defence chiefs who insist that the radioactive dust quickly disperses to safe levels, posing 'negligible risk'. Busby's research will fuel the rapidly escalating international controversy over links between depleted uranium ammunition - used by US forces in both Bosnia and Kosovo - and claims that it has caused fatal cancers in peacekeepers who served there. According to Dr Busby, air samples taken from Iraqi Gulf War battlefields last year, where more than 300,000 rounds of depleted uranium ammunition were used, show levels of irradiated particles in the atmosphere ten times higher than the neighbouring city of Basra and 20 times higher than Baghdad. Iraq has long alleged that depleted uranium is responsible for abnormally high levels of childhood leukemia and birth defects following the Gulf War. Concern over the safety of depleted uranium was reignited last month when Italy announced an investigation into 30 cases of illness involving soldiers who served in the region. Five have died from leukemia. Belgium, Spain and Portugal have also reported suspicious deaths. The European Union has announced that it will debate the safety of depleted uranium weapons on Tuesday, further increasing pressure on Britain's Ministry of Defence which is now almost entirely isolated within Europe in resisting calls to test its Balkan veterans. Ex-Royal Engineer Kevin Rudland has emerged as the first British case of Balkans Syndrome, claiming that he suffered a series of debilitating health problems after serving in Bosnia. Dr Busby's claims follow the disclosure on Friday of the first results of a UN survey of uranium contamination in Kosovo. The study identified contamination at eight out of 11 sites it visited a year and a half after the end of the bombing campaign. Despite repeated claims by the Pentagon and the MoD that debris from depleted uranium poses little risk except to those close to the immediate aftermath of their use, The Observer has established that UN civilian workers in Kosovo have been explicitly warned about the potential health risks from contamination.",

'Although we back much of what the report says on drugs education and rehabilitation, on the issue of reclassification of hard drugs and on the issue of cannabis in general, we do not agree with the findings.' The move will dismay campaigners who say that Britain has the toughest anti-drugs laws in Europe and that the Government should make a clearer distinction between hard drugs such as heroin and cocaine and softer drugs such as cannabis. Dame Ruth Runciman, who wrote the report, will increase pressure on the Government this week when she says that the Home Office is being slow to respond to the recommendations, which were published last March. She will tell a drugs conference organised by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation that the Government is seeking to cherry pick the foundation's ideas, a policy she says will not work. The report provides 'a middle ground approach', she will say, and it should be implemented in full. A Government source said: 'How long did she take to write the report? About two years. So the fact that we have taken some time to think a lot about what she is saying is reasonable.' He said the Government's 10-year strategy on drugs was starting to have results, with evidence that the number of people taking drugs was falling. But anti-Government campaigners point to polls showing that the majority want to see cannabis decriminalised. Many senior police officers have also admitted that they no longer prosecute people for small scale cannabis offences because it is a waste of resources. The seven key areas that will be rejected are: \u0095 Making the possession of cannabis a non-imprisonable offence. \u0095 Allowing people to defend themselves against charges of supplying drugs such as ecstasy if they can say that it was only for use by a small circle of friends. \u0095 Reducing the sentences for those convicted of offences involving Class A drugs such as heroin. \u0095 Making more sentences involving softer drugs community based rather than prison based. \u0095 Ensuring that people prosecuted for cultivating a small number of cannabis plants do not face prison. \u0095 Reclassifying ecstasy and LSD from Class A to Class B drugs. \u0095 Reclassifying cannabis from Class B to Class C.",

      "body": "<p>A glistening cold winter's day in the Highlands, and Frank Durdle is reminiscing about salmon. For more than 40 years, he has spent a fair amount of his time below the sweeping stone arch of Lovat Bridge in Beauly, near Inverness, pitting his wits against the salmon which battle their way through the pools of the town's eponymous river to their spawning grounds. </p> <p>Durdle is passionate about salmo salar, the Atlantic salmon: he reveres it as an iconic animal, respects it as a worthy opponent, savours it as a uniquely flavoured meal. 'I can remember as a boy when the fish ran through here in their hundreds,' he says. 'We would stand and watch them leaping out of the water, with the light flashing on their scales. Those were good days. And the taste. There is nothing like it.' </p> <p>These, too, should be happy times for the president of the Beauly Angling Club. The wild salmon season finished in mid-October, but he no longer needs to wait until the fish start running again in late spring to get salmon on his plate. </p> <p>Aquaculture - fish farming as it is better known - has heralded an age in which corner shops, let alone the major supermarket chains, are able to have their shelves groaning under the weight of fresh salmon 365 days a year. Good season, bad season, it matters not. But the prospect of year-round salmon fills Durdle with little joy. 'I can't remember the last time I bought farmed salmon and I wouldn't buy it,' he says. 'It is an inferior product and tastes nothing like the real thing. It's all flab and fat, no flavour.' This is not merely the pride of a veteran angler talking. </p> <p>'Farmed salmon is produced in a completely unnatural way and the industry is causing God knows what damage,' he continues. 'It's high time people realised that being able to buy cheap salmon all year round carries a heavy price in other ways.' For the 21st century consumer, salmon is available in every possible formulation - from whole fish and smoked slices to fillets, steaks, pies and even something called crunchy bites. </p> <p>Better still, it is cheap yet looks like it came from the same place as its wild relation, with that rich, pink hue. Even the packaging is rustic. Nothing, apart from the bargain-basement price tag, to give away the reality of intensive salmon production, which has turned the King of Fish into the battery chicken of the seas. </p> <p>But this week, farmed salmon was at the centre of the latest food scare to hit the British consumer. New research, the BBC's Online news service claimed, had found that fish reared intensively in cages contained 10 times the level of cancer-causing toxins as their wild cousins. </p> <p>The story - taken from a wildlife documentary to be screened on BBC2 tonight - was immediately rubbished, not just by the fish farming industry, but by the Government's Food Standards Agency, and most damningly, the scientist who carried out the research. </p> <p>Even the Government intervened, with Scottish Office Minister Brian Wilson calling the programme 'wildly inaccurate' and attacking the BBC for what he claimed was 'crass irresponsibility' in its pre-publicity. </p> <p>He alleged the claims made to publicise the programme amounted to an effort, on the basis of no substantial evidence, to start a food scare and ruin an industry which was of vital importance to many fragile rural communities. </p> <p>But fish farming is far from squeaky clean, and the safety fears raised in tonight's programme, Warnings from the Wild: the Price of Salmon, are all too real. For more than two decades, the British aquaculture industry has been able to do as it pleased, relying on the fact that the jobs and investment it provided in some of the most remote and poorest parts of the country would discourage Ministers from getting too tough. Now, at last, the game may be up. </p> <p>Fish farming was an inspirational idea. In the 1960s and 1970s, it was devised as a cottage industry, the new crofting, bringing employment and prosperity to the Highlands and Islands to reverse years of decline. In the sea lochs up the west coast from Argyllshire to Sutherland, in the Western Isles and in Orkney and the Shetlands, the farms began to spring up. By 1980, the output of the Scottish industry was a little more than 800 tonnes. Last year, the 340 farms - 70 per cent of them now owned by hulking multinational corporations such as Norway's Norsk Hydro or the Dutch giant, Marine Harvest - produced 127,000 tonnes of salmon. </p> <p>Salmon, packed with omega-3 oils, is a rich source of protein. But the growth in output has only been achieved by an increasing intensification of the production process. Yet consumers, who, after repeated food safety scares, would never consider buying a battery-produced chicken, still labour under the misconception that because farmed salmon come from the sea, they are little different from their wild counterparts. Wrong. </p> <p>Farmed salmon start their lives in a freshwater hatchery. Time is money, and every hi-tech method available is employed to speed up the young salmon's natural growing period. One popular trick is light manipulation. The hatchery tanks are covered over so they are completely dark, then intense lights are shone in to fool the fish into thinking that they are going through their natural growing seasons. Longer periods of light equals summer, shorter periods of light equals winter. 'If people knew all the things we did to make them grow, they would never go near salmon again,' said a former hatchery worker from the Inverness area, who agreed to speak to The Observer on condition of anonymity. </p> <p>'The only consideration was to get the fish from the hatchery to the market as quickly as possible.' </p> <p>The salmon go from the hatcheries to the cages, usually situated at the mouths of sea lochs. The cages are vast, up to 70 metres in diameter and some farms are already moving to 90-metre cages. But the fish are packed in tight, with up to 250,000 of them battling for survival space in each one. At these densities, the fish are at the mercy of disease and infestation from parasites. </p> <p>Sea lice are a naturally occurring parasite found in wild fish. A healthy adult fish would normally carry five or six lice, but in the close confines of the sea cages, the lice are endemic. The fish are unable to swim away into freshwater to get rid of the parasites. The only solution is the use of vaccinations and toxic pesticides, such as pyrethroid chemicals. </p> <p>'Salmon are farmed in cages at higher densities than battery hens,' says Don Staniford, researcher for Friends of the Earth Scotland. 'They are fed a diet marinated in chemicals and artificial colourings, injected with vaccines and growth promoters, then starved for 10 days before being slaughtered.' </p> <p>The industry's collective voice, Scottish Quality Salmon, insists that pesticide use is strictly regulated. But there have been worrying signs of farms using illicit substances to control the disease which high density cages make inevitable. </p> <p>In the summer, Ardessie Salmon, based in Wester Ross, was stripped of its Scottish Quality Salmon membership after The Observer revealed evidence from a former employee of the farm that toxic chemicals were used on a regular basis. A second whistleblower later confirmed the allegations, claiming that the farm had given young salmon deosan deosect to treat lice. The chemical is used to treat horses but becomes deadly when used in aquatic systems. Then, in September, it emerged that a study by the Veterinary Medicines Directorate had found traces of the banned toxic neuroinsecticide Ivermectin in samples of farmed salmon at levels up to four times the legal limit. The residues, found in three of 30 fish tested as part of the VMD's routine surveillance scheme, have sparked an investigation by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food's legal branch and the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency. The owners of the farms involved, which have not been identified, may face prosecution. </p> <p>The number of medicinal products licensed for use in salmon farms has risen from three in 1989 to 26 last year, with a further 14 under consideration. But even these authorised substances carry serious hazards. 'Most of these treatments are general purpose poisons for dealing with crustaceans,' says Colin Adams, a biologist at Glasgow University. </p> <p>'The ongrowing cages are open to the environment so to treat the fish for diseases means that the treatment seeps into the environment and can damage the habitats around the cages.' </p> <p>Yet the cycle of chemical treatment has not prevented disease, which has become more acute as densities and growth rates have increased. In 1998, a new disease, infectious salmon anaemia (ISA), swept through west coast salmon farms. More than 40,000 fish were slaughtered and a quarter of Scottish farms were closed for quarantine. But the measures may have been too late; this year, an escaped farm salmon with ISA was caught in a west coast river, prompting fears it may already have infected wild stocks. </p> <p>While they are in the sea cages, the fish are fattened up on a diet of pellets made from the rendered remains of small fish that have a high oil content to promote growth. A third of the fish taken from the world's seas are now used to feed other fish. But now questions are being raised about the public health implications of this intensive feeding regime. </p> <p>As tonight's documentary shows, these small fish are already contaminated with man-made pollutants found in the sea. Toxic chemicals, such as dioxins, a by-product of industrial incineration, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) which can cause cancer and learning difficulties in children, can be found at low levels in all fish. </p> <p>The fear now is that by compressing them into pellets to feed other fish, we are magnifying the contamination and allowing it, BSE-style, into the human food chain. A pilot study for Canada's David Suzuki Foundation backed up these concerns: Michael Easton analysed four different types of fish feed and tested four farmed salmon from different sources and four wild Pacific salmon. 'The results were very, very clear,' Dr Easton tells the programme. 'Farmed fish and the feed that they were fed appeared to have a much higher level of contamination with respect to PCBs, organochlorine pesticides and polybrominated diphenyl ethers than did wild fish. In fact, the difference was extremely noticeable.' </p> <p>The Food Standards Agency contin ues to insist there is no evidence that farmed salmon are more at risk of contamination than wild fish. But in Brussels, the European Commission is already considering how to lower the dioxin and PCB contamination of farmed salmon amid concerns about public health. Two of the EU'S eminent scientific committees have just produced the results of long-running investigations into PCB contamination, both of which back the case for action. The reports will be considered at a meeting in Brussels this month which could lead to tough European-wide action. The report by the Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition, for example, concludes: 'As farmed fish combines an important consumption of feed materials of fish origin (up to 75 per cent in the diet of carnivorous species) with a high level of contamination of these feed materials, it is the food-producing animal most exposed to dioxins.' </p> <p>But still Britain refuses to take action. 'The UK government's failure to monitor for dioxins in farmed fish is playing fast and loose with public health,' said Kevin Dunion, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland. 'For every day that they fail to act, public health and the good name of Scottish quality salmon is put at risk.' </p> <p>The intensive feeding regimes also carry a heavy cost to the environment. In many farms, the fish are fed automatically, and much of the feed will drop straight through the cages to gather on the bottom of the loch along with the ammonium-rich salmon excreta. It is estimated that a 1,000-tonne salmon farm - small by current industry standards - produces sewage waste equivalent to a town of 20,000 people. According to WWF (formerly the Worldwide Fund for Nature), the level of pollution from fish farms on the west coast of Scotland is comparable to the sewage input of up to 9.4 million people. </p> <p>The resulting mix nutrifies the surrounding waters, destroying delicate marine habitats. More disturbingly, it is also being blamed for spawning the toxic algae blooms which in recent years have closed down 9,000 square miles of west coast shellfish fisheries because the toxins cause amnesiac shellfish poisoning, an irreversible disease that can cause brain damage in humans. 'The siting of salmon farms at the heads of sea lochs is a major problem,' says Adams. 'You need tidal flush to remove the nutrients, diluting them and sweeping them out to sea. But in the deep, glacial lochs around the farm the flushing rate is so poor that it is akin to flushing your toilet once every two weeks.' In some lochs, that figure may be as bad as once every two years. </p> <p>Additives are also included in the food to give the fish their hue. The most popular is canthaxanthin, which the industry insists is a natural pigment found in flamingos and shrimp. They prefer it because it produces vibrant colours. One pigment manufacturer, the Swiss pharmaceuticals giant Roche, has even produced the Salmofan which opens out into a handy colour chart for salmon, allowing the farmers to choose the colour of their fish in exactly the same way as the rest of us choose the colour of paint for our homes. But there are question marks over the safety of the substance. Some research has found that it can cause deposits of yellow particles on the human retina, with children's eyes thought to be particularly vulnerable. Canthaxanthin is banned for direct human consumption, and sun-tan pills containing it were taken off the market in 1987. </p> <p>The high-oil content of the farmed fish's diet and their close confinement means they do not develop like wild salmon. The wild creature is pure muscle, honed after swimming thousands of miles. The farmed version is soft and oily because its range is restricted to tiny circles. Because farmed fish contain up to 15 per cent more fat tissue than their wild cousins, it is possible to tell a farmed salmon by the bubbles of oil which run down the knife while it is being sliced. </p> <p>Some salmon farm proprietors deny that the finished product is any different from the wild fish. Gilpin Bradley is the manager of Wester Ross Salmon, a small operator producing 1,000 tonnes of fish a year at sites near Ullapool on the north west coast. 'We take the natural life cycle of the salmon and we duplicate it in captivity in a way that protects the welfare of the fish,' he says. </p> <p>'This is a fish which has to lay down a lot of fat in the wild. It has to swim out to sea then it has to come back to spawn. It doesn't eat when it comes back into freshwater so it has to be strong enough to make its way up the river. You find me 10 people who say they prefer wild salmon to farmed salmon. I will cook up some of each and defy them to tell the difference.' </p> <p>But those who prefer wild salmon may soon find themselves forced to eat the farmed stuff or go without. Perhaps the cruellest irony of the exponential growth in fish farming is that it has come close to driving wild fish, the very creature it was designed to save, to the brink of extinction. Over the past 10 years, wild salmon stocks have declined to all-time lows, but in the north-west Highlands, centre of the aquaculture industry, stocks have been devastated. The cause: infestation of sea lice on wild fish caused by the proximity of caged salmon. In the wild fisheries close to the fish farms, salmon and sea trout have been found with up to 500 lice on them, which cause horrific damage. The lice graze on the flesh of the fish, effectively eating it from the outside in. The Lochy, for example, was once the most productive salmon fishery in the region, with up to 1,200 fish being caught in a single season. Last year, 100 fish were caught. Juvenile salmon - a key indicator of future conditions - are either missing or extremely rare. </p> <p>The problem has at last been recognised. Last summer, after years of denial, the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency, responsible for protecting Scottish rivers and lochs, finally admitted that the link between sea lice infestation and the decline of wild salmon stocks was 'beyond reasonable doubt'. Now, two committees of the Scottish Parliament are about to embark on an investigation into the environmental impact of intensive aquaculture. But not all fish farmers are willing to admit defeat. </p> <p>'Lice are not a bad thing,' says Bradley. 'Salmon are a naturally shoaling fish so they are used to being in close contact with other salmon. I've been in salmon farming all my life and when farmed salmon first went on the market the way to judge its freshness was by the number of lice on the fish.' </p> <p>Colin Adams says: 'That is complete nonsense. The fish farming industry has had serious problems with lice. They are destructive to the farmed fish and they cause them enormous stress. The farms deal with that by treating the salmon but the lice are able to spread into the wild salmon which cannot get treated.' </p> <p>But 20 years on there can be no turning back the clock. As overfishing of wild stocks makes once-common fish like cod scarce, it will be up to the farmed fish to fill the protein gap in human diets. Projections from the World Bank and the United Nations estimate that by 2020, more than half the fish we consume will be farmed, while world salmon farming is projected to treble from 600,000 tonnes in 1997 to 2 million in 2010. </p> <p>Is there any way this need for farmed fish can be squared with producing a clean product that does not damage the environment? </p> <p>Kirsty McCallum believes the answer lies in the Northern Isles. Here, in the shallow, fast-flowing voes at the conflu ence of the Atlantic and the North Sea, Britain's first organic fish farm industry is gathering pace. On Soil Association-certified farms such as Bruce Mainland's in Orkney, salmon are being produced at about half the densities of the conventional farms without the use of toxic chemicals or colourings. The fish are handfed, using meal made from crushed shrimp shell and organic vegetables. Only 24 per cent oil is allowed by the organic standards so the texture and flavour are light and natural. And, crucially, the tidal flush is high so lice and disease are rarely a problem, and there are no wild stocks to pollute anyway. </p> <p>'If we could start all over again, salmon farms wouldn't still be sited in the sea lochs up the west coast,' says McCallum, managing director of The Orkney Salmon Company, which markets produce from the local farms. 'They would be in areas like Orkney where the water exchange is much better. There have been grave mistakes made in the past.' </p> <p>'What supports the organic industry is that the consumer knows at the end of the day that they are buying something better,' she adds. 'They might not understand exactly what it is, but they will know that the production methods mean the fish will have been allowed to swim and to live in as natural as way as possible.' </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:stuart.millar@observer.co.uk\">stuart.millar@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "A glistening cold winter's day in the Highlands, and Frank Durdle is reminiscing about salmon. For more than 40 years, he has spent a fair amount of his time below the sweeping stone arch of Lovat Bridge in Beauly, near Inverness, pitting his wits against the salmon which battle their way through the pools of the town's eponymous river to their spawning grounds. Durdle is passionate about salmo salar, the Atlantic salmon: he reveres it as an iconic animal, respects it as a worthy opponent, savours it as a uniquely flavoured meal. 'I can remember as a boy when the fish ran through here in their hundreds,' he says. 'We would stand and watch them leaping out of the water, with the light flashing on their scales. Those were good days. And the taste. There is nothing like it.' These, too, should be happy times for the president of the Beauly Angling Club. The wild salmon season finished in mid-October, but he no longer needs to wait until the fish start running again in late spring to get salmon on his plate. Aquaculture - fish farming as it is better known - has heralded an age in which corner shops, let alone the major supermarket chains, are able to have their shelves groaning under the weight of fresh salmon 365 days a year. Good season, bad season, it matters not. But the prospect of year-round salmon fills Durdle with little joy. 'I can't remember the last time I bought farmed salmon and I wouldn't buy it,' he says. 'It is an inferior product and tastes nothing like the real thing. It's all flab and fat, no flavour.' This is not merely the pride of a veteran angler talking. 'Farmed salmon is produced in a completely unnatural way and the industry is causing God knows what damage,' he continues. 'It's high time people realised that being able to buy cheap salmon all year round carries a heavy price in other ways.' For the 21st century consumer, salmon is available in every possible formulation - from whole fish and smoked slices to fillets, steaks, pies and even something called crunchy bites. Better still, it is cheap yet looks like it came from the same place as its wild relation, with that rich, pink hue. Even the packaging is rustic. Nothing, apart from the bargain-basement price tag, to give away the reality of intensive salmon production, which has turned the King of Fish into the battery chicken of the seas. But this week, farmed salmon was at the centre of the latest food scare to hit the British consumer. New research, the BBC's Online news service claimed, had found that fish reared intensively in cages contained 10 times the level of cancer-causing toxins as their wild cousins. The story - taken from a wildlife documentary to be screened on BBC2 tonight - was immediately rubbished, not just by the fish farming industry, but by the Government's Food Standards Agency, and most damningly, the scientist who carried out the research. Even the Government intervened, with Scottish Office Minister Brian Wilson calling the programme 'wildly inaccurate' and attacking the BBC for what he claimed was 'crass irresponsibility' in its pre-publicity. He alleged the claims made to publicise the programme amounted to an effort, on the basis of no substantial evidence, to start a food scare and ruin an industry which was of vital importance to many fragile rural communities. But fish farming is far from squeaky clean, and the safety fears raised in tonight's programme, Warnings from the Wild: the Price of Salmon, are all too real. For more than two decades, the British aquaculture industry has been able to do as it pleased, relying on the fact that the jobs and investment it provided in some of the most remote and poorest parts of the country would discourage Ministers from getting too tough. Now, at last, the game may be up. Fish farming was an inspirational idea. In the 1960s and 1970s, it was devised as a cottage industry, the new crofting, bringing employment and prosperity to the Highlands and Islands to reverse years of decline. In the sea lochs up the west coast from Argyllshire to Sutherland, in the Western Isles and in Orkney and the Shetlands, the farms began to spring up. By 1980, the output of the Scottish industry was a little more than 800 tonnes. Last year, the 340 farms - 70 per cent of them now owned by hulking multinational corporations such as Norway's Norsk Hydro or the Dutch giant, Marine Harvest - produced 127,000 tonnes of salmon. Salmon, packed with omega-3 oils, is a rich source of protein. But the growth in output has only been achieved by an increasing intensification of the production process. Yet consumers, who, after repeated food safety scares, would never consider buying a battery-produced chicken, still labour under the misconception that because farmed salmon come from the sea, they are little different from their wild counterparts. Wrong. Farmed salmon start their lives in a freshwater hatchery. Time is money, and every hi-tech method available is employed to speed up the young salmon's natural growing period. One popular trick is light manipulation. The hatchery tanks are covered over so they are completely dark, then intense lights are shone in to fool the fish into thinking that they are going through their natural growing seasons. Longer periods of light equals summer, shorter periods of light equals winter. 'If people knew all the things we did to make them grow, they would never go near salmon again,' said a former hatchery worker from the Inverness area, who agreed to speak to The Observer on condition of anonymity. 'The only consideration was to get the fish from the hatchery to the market as quickly as possible.' The salmon go from the hatcheries to the cages, usually situated at the mouths of sea lochs. The cages are vast, up to 70 metres in diameter and some farms are already moving to 90-metre cages. But the fish are packed in tight, with up to 250,000 of them battling for survival space in each one. At these densities, the fish are at the mercy of disease and infestation from parasites. Sea lice are a naturally occurring parasite found in wild fish. A healthy adult fish would normally carry five or six lice, but in the close confines of the sea cages, the lice are endemic. The fish are unable to swim away into freshwater to get rid of the parasites. The only solution is the use of vaccinations and toxic pesticides, such as pyrethroid chemicals. 'Salmon are farmed in cages at higher densities than battery hens,' says Don Staniford, researcher for Friends of the Earth Scotland. 'They are fed a diet marinated in chemicals and artificial colourings, injected with vaccines and growth promoters, then starved for 10 days before being slaughtered.' The industry's collective voice, Scottish Quality Salmon, insists that pesticide use is strictly regulated. But there have been worrying signs of farms using illicit substances to control the disease which high density cages make inevitable. In the summer, Ardessie Salmon, based in Wester Ross, was stripped of its Scottish Quality Salmon membership after The Observer revealed evidence from a former employee of the farm that toxic chemicals were used on a regular basis. A second whistleblower later confirmed the allegations, claiming that the farm had given young salmon deosan deosect to treat lice. The chemical is used to treat horses but becomes deadly when used in aquatic systems. Then, in September, it emerged that a study by the Veterinary Medicines Directorate had found traces of the banned toxic neuroinsecticide Ivermectin in samples of farmed salmon at levels up to four times the legal limit. The residues, found in three of 30 fish tested as part of the VMD's routine surveillance scheme, have sparked an investigation by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food's legal branch and the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency. The owners of the farms involved, which have not been identified, may face prosecution. The number of medicinal products licensed for use in salmon farms has risen from three in 1989 to 26 last year, with a further 14 under consideration. But even these authorised substances carry serious hazards. 'Most of these treatments are general purpose poisons for dealing with crustaceans,' says Colin Adams, a biologist at Glasgow University. 'The ongrowing cages are open to the environment so to treat the fish for diseases means that the treatment seeps into the environment and can damage the habitats around the cages.' Yet the cycle of chemical treatment has not prevented disease, which has become more acute as densities and growth rates have increased. In 1998, a new disease, infectious salmon anaemia (ISA), swept through west coast salmon farms. More than 40,000 fish were slaughtered and a quarter of Scottish farms were closed for quarantine. But the measures may have been too late; this year, an escaped farm salmon with ISA was caught in a west coast river, prompting fears it may already have infected wild stocks. While they are in the sea cages, the fish are fattened up on a diet of pellets made from the rendered remains of small fish that have a high oil content to promote growth. A third of the fish taken from the world's seas are now used to feed other fish. But now questions are being raised about the public health implications of this intensive feeding regime. As tonight's documentary shows, these small fish are already contaminated with man-made pollutants found in the sea. Toxic chemicals, such as dioxins, a by-product of industrial incineration, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) which can cause cancer and learning difficulties in children, can be found at low levels in all fish. The fear now is that by compressing them into pellets to feed other fish, we are magnifying the contamination and allowing it, BSE-style, into the human food chain. A pilot study for Canada's David Suzuki Foundation backed up these concerns: Michael Easton analysed four different types of fish feed and tested four farmed salmon from different sources and four wild Pacific salmon. 'The results were very, very clear,' Dr Easton tells the programme. 'Farmed fish and the feed that they were fed appeared to have a much higher level of contamination with respect to PCBs, organochlorine pesticides and polybrominated diphenyl ethers than did wild fish. In fact, the difference was extremely noticeable.' The Food Standards Agency contin ues to insist there is no evidence that farmed salmon are more at risk of contamination than wild fish. But in Brussels, the European Commission is already considering how to lower the dioxin and PCB contamination of farmed salmon amid concerns about public health. Two of the EU'S eminent scientific committees have just produced the results of long-running investigations into PCB contamination, both of which back the case for action. The reports will be considered at a meeting in Brussels this month which could lead to tough European-wide action. The report by the Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition, for example, concludes: 'As farmed fish combines an important consumption of feed materials of fish origin (up to 75 per cent in the diet of carnivorous species) with a high level of contamination of these feed materials, it is the food-producing animal most exposed to dioxins.' But still Britain refuses to take action. 'The UK government's failure to monitor for dioxins in farmed fish is playing fast and loose with public health,' said Kevin Dunion, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland. 'For every day that they fail to act, public health and the good name of Scottish quality salmon is put at risk.' The intensive feeding regimes also carry a heavy cost to the environment. In many farms, the fish are fed automatically, and much of the feed will drop straight through the cages to gather on the bottom of the loch along with the ammonium-rich salmon excreta. It is estimated that a 1,000-tonne salmon farm - small by current industry standards - produces sewage waste equivalent to a town of 20,000 people. According to WWF (formerly the Worldwide Fund for Nature), the level of pollution from fish farms on the west coast of Scotland is comparable to the sewage input of up to 9.4 million people. The resulting mix nutrifies the surrounding waters, destroying delicate marine habitats. More disturbingly, it is also being blamed for spawning the toxic algae blooms which in recent years have closed down 9,000 square miles of west coast shellfish fisheries because the toxins cause amnesiac shellfish poisoning, an irreversible disease that can cause brain damage in humans. 'The siting of salmon farms at the heads of sea lochs is a major problem,' says Adams. 'You need tidal flush to remove the nutrients, diluting them and sweeping them out to sea. But in the deep, glacial lochs around the farm the flushing rate is so poor that it is akin to flushing your toilet once every two weeks.' In some lochs, that figure may be as bad as once every two years. Additives are also included in the food to give the fish their hue. The most popular is canthaxanthin, which the industry insists is a natural pigment found in flamingos and shrimp. They prefer it because it produces vibrant colours. One pigment manufacturer, the Swiss pharmaceuticals giant Roche, has even produced the Salmofan which opens out into a handy colour chart for salmon, allowing the farmers to choose the colour of their fish in exactly the same way as the rest of us choose the colour of paint for our homes. But there are question marks over the safety of the substance. Some research has found that it can cause deposits of yellow particles on the human retina, with children's eyes thought to be particularly vulnerable. Canthaxanthin is banned for direct human consumption, and sun-tan pills containing it were taken off the market in 1987. The high-oil content of the farmed fish's diet and their close confinement means they do not develop like wild salmon. The wild creature is pure muscle, honed after swimming thousands of miles. The farmed version is soft and oily because its range is restricted to tiny circles. Because farmed fish contain up to 15 per cent more fat tissue than their wild cousins, it is possible to tell a farmed salmon by the bubbles of oil which run down the knife while it is being sliced. Some salmon farm proprietors deny that the finished product is any different from the wild fish. Gilpin Bradley is the manager of Wester Ross Salmon, a small operator producing 1,000 tonnes of fish a year at sites near Ullapool on the north west coast. 'We take the natural life cycle of the salmon and we duplicate it in captivity in a way that protects the welfare of the fish,' he says. 'This is a fish which has to lay down a lot of fat in the wild. It has to swim out to sea then it has to come back to spawn. It doesn't eat when it comes back into freshwater so it has to be strong enough to make its way up the river. You find me 10 people who say they prefer wild salmon to farmed salmon. I will cook up some of each and defy them to tell the difference.' But those who prefer wild salmon may soon find themselves forced to eat the farmed stuff or go without. Perhaps the cruellest irony of the exponential growth in fish farming is that it has come close to driving wild fish, the very creature it was designed to save, to the brink of extinction. Over the past 10 years, wild salmon stocks have declined to all-time lows, but in the north-west Highlands, centre of the aquaculture industry, stocks have been devastated. The cause: infestation of sea lice on wild fish caused by the proximity of caged salmon. In the wild fisheries close to the fish farms, salmon and sea trout have been found with up to 500 lice on them, which cause horrific damage. The lice graze on the flesh of the fish, effectively eating it from the outside in. The Lochy, for example, was once the most productive salmon fishery in the region, with up to 1,200 fish being caught in a single season. Last year, 100 fish were caught. Juvenile salmon - a key indicator of future conditions - are either missing or extremely rare. The problem has at last been recognised. Last summer, after years of denial, the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency, responsible for protecting Scottish rivers and lochs, finally admitted that the link between sea lice infestation and the decline of wild salmon stocks was 'beyond reasonable doubt'. Now, two committees of the Scottish Parliament are about to embark on an investigation into the environmental impact of intensive aquaculture. But not all fish farmers are willing to admit defeat. 'Lice are not a bad thing,' says Bradley. 'Salmon are a naturally shoaling fish so they are used to being in close contact with other salmon. I've been in salmon farming all my life and when farmed salmon first went on the market the way to judge its freshness was by the number of lice on the fish.' Colin Adams says: 'That is complete nonsense. The fish farming industry has had serious problems with lice. They are destructive to the farmed fish and they cause them enormous stress. The farms deal with that by treating the salmon but the lice are able to spread into the wild salmon which cannot get treated.' But 20 years on there can be no turning back the clock. As overfishing of wild stocks makes once-common fish like cod scarce, it will be up to the farmed fish to fill the protein gap in human diets. Projections from the World Bank and the United Nations estimate that by 2020, more than half the fish we consume will be farmed, while world salmon farming is projected to treble from 600,000 tonnes in 1997 to 2 million in 2010. Is there any way this need for farmed fish can be squared with producing a clean product that does not damage the environment? Kirsty McCallum believes the answer lies in the Northern Isles. Here, in the shallow, fast-flowing voes at the conflu ence of the Atlantic and the North Sea, Britain's first organic fish farm industry is gathering pace. On Soil Association-certified farms such as Bruce Mainland's in Orkney, salmon are being produced at about half the densities of the conventional farms without the use of toxic chemicals or colourings. The fish are handfed, using meal made from crushed shrimp shell and organic vegetables. Only 24 per cent oil is allowed by the organic standards so the texture and flavour are light and natural. And, crucially, the tidal flush is high so lice and disease are rarely a problem, and there are no wild stocks to pollute anyway. 'If we could start all over again, salmon farms wouldn't still be sited in the sea lochs up the west coast,' says McCallum, managing director of The Orkney Salmon Company, which markets produce from the local farms. 'They would be in areas like Orkney where the water exchange is much better. There have been grave mistakes made in the past.' 'What supports the organic industry is that the consumer knows at the end of the day that they are buying something better,' she adds. 'They might not understand exactly what it is, but they will know that the production methods mean the fish will have been allowed to swim and to live in as natural as way as possible.' stuart.millar@observer.co.uk",

Levy thought a little before giving his reply. 'Not at all,' he said. 'It was made absolutely clear when fund-raising started that under no circumstances would any gift be countenanced for any form of favour, whether that be business, or influence. It was about wanting to support the party with no other motive because of what they believed the party was doing, and they wanted change.'</p> <p>But why such large amounts?

Caught out last weekend when Sunday newspapers revealed the existence of a \u00a32 million Labour donor the party refused to name, they have been playing catch-up ever since. On Wednesday, under pressure from its own back benchers, the party reluctantly announced that it was the publisher Lord Hamlyn who had donated the \u00a32m.

How important is the champagne and canap\u00e9 circuit for the businessmen who want to influence Government? If three men were in a position to donate more than a quarter of all the money Labour will spend over the next year, what did that say about the state of political funding in Britain?

      "bodyText": "Exactly a year and 13 days after Tony Blair first made his way along Downing Street as the new Prime Minister, Lord Levy arrived at the St Stephen's entrance of Parliament ready to do combat. In half an hour the multi-millionaire at the centre of Labour's fund-raising network would be appearing before Lord Neill, the man charged by Blair with investigating and proposing new rules on the funding of political parties. With Levy were Margaret McDonagh, the general secretary of the Labour Party, and David Pitt-Watson, Labour's director of finance. There was a central question Lord Neill wanted answered: were large donations to the party a way of buying influence at the heart of power? Levy thought a little before giving his reply. 'Not at all,' he said. 'It was made absolutely clear when fund-raising started that under no circumstances would any gift be countenanced for any form of favour, whether that be business, or influence. It was about wanting to support the party with no other motive because of what they believed the party was doing, and they wanted change.' But why such large amounts? 'It would be quite ludicrous for a man who is perhaps giving away many millions of pounds to charity or to the arts to give \u00a350 to a party.' The last seven days have been rocky ones for Labour. Caught out last weekend when Sunday newspapers revealed the existence of a \u00a32 million Labour donor the party refused to name, they have been playing catch-up ever since. On Wednesday, under pressure from its own back benchers, the party reluctantly announced that it was the publisher Lord Hamlyn who had donated the \u00a32m. On Thursday, under intense media pressure, more millionaire donors came tumbling out: the writer and publisher Christopher Ondaatje and the Science Minister and former supermarket boss Lord Sainsbury have each given \u00a32m, the party admitted. The controversy was then injected with a shot of champagne. It was revealed that Robert Bourne, close Labour friend and the leading figure in the Legacy bid to run the Dome, hosted a lavish birthday party for Peter Mandelson, who was once Minister with responsibility for the Dome. Bourne, who with his wife, Sally Greene, can count many of the Cabinet as personal friends, has also donated \u00a3100,000 to the Labour Party. He has given money to Chris Smith's constituency office. Smith's Department of Culture, Media and Sport has overall control of Dome policy. Questions were asked. How important is the champagne and canap\u00e9 circuit for the businessmen who want to influence Government? If three men were in a position to donate more than a quarter of all the money Labour will spend over the next year, what did that say about the state of political funding in Britain? What advantage does Bourne get as a man whose business relies on a Government that numbers many of his good friends? And if these people weren't buying influence, then what the hell were they buying? Amanda Delew is not a name on the lips of too many supporters of the 'People's Party'. As the head of Labour's high value donor unit and Lord Levy's deputy, if you receive a telephone call from her it might be time to reach for your cheque book. Delew, known as 'deloot' by unkind colleagues, was brought into the Labour Party by Levy from Jewish Care, a charity Levy supports. Her approach to fund-raising is simple: people are flattered by access and the ability to hob nob with powerful people. Give them the impression that they are influencing affairs and they will stuff their hands a little bit deeper into their pockets. Delew is Labour's fund-raising lynchpin. 'Major donors expect to be invited to Number 10. If this cannot take place then income levels may be affected,' she wrote in an internal party memo shortly after the last election. 'The support of Tony Blair and Jonathan Powell [Downing Street's chief of staff] is critical to the success of the programme. Major donors need to feel that they are at the centre of things. Jonathan offers an opportunity for them to meet someone at the focus of all activity, who will answer their questions, while providing a reason for them to visit No 10.' She said that Powell was essential to fund-raising activities because of his ability to 'charm and impress' potential donors. That is the key to party fund-raising. People want to feel loved and involved. That is why, as The Observer revealed last week, the Tories are facing crumbling levels of corporate support. They are not powerful and not loved. Donors are therefore melting away, leaving the party reliant on the businessmen Lord Ashcroft and Irvine Laidlaw for much of their funding. Just before the last election it was Delew who sought out supporters for a \u00a310,000 champagne reception to celebrate after May 1. It was Delew who organised what became known as the 'most expensive cheese and wine party in British political history' when, in January 1997, she invited senior businessmen and celebrities, including Greg Dyke, Jeremy Irons, Melvyn Bragg and David Puttnam, to a drinks reception at Millbank, Labour's headquarters. Mandelson gave a short speech at the party, jokingly saying that no one should leave before they had donated \u00a325,000. 'What the bloody hell are we supposed to do?' one exasperated Labour Party official said last week. 'We are a large organisation which is expensive to run. We have to get donations to do that. We, unlike the Opposition, do not get state funding. Are we just supposed to sit around and wait for people to write us a cheque? That would be us back to the dark ages.' But there is a thin line between a slick fund-raising operation and the whiff of cash for access. Ondaatje and Hamlyn are regular guests at fund-raising events where they are given plenty of 'social-time' with Ministers. When Clive Soley, the chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, appeared on Newsnight last week he inadvertently referred to 'Lord Ondaatje'. He isn't a lord yet but, given the history of other Labour donors, he soon will be. Lord Sainsbury, who has now given \u00a34m of his personal wealth to the party, is the Government's Science Minister who was embroiled in controversy when it was revealed that Sainsbury's supermarket was investing heavily in genetically modified food research, an area that his department was responsible for. When Delew's fund-raising memo was leaked, Smith, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, dismissed her as a 'middle ranking official'. The party was desperate to say that these people are unimportant in the big scheme of things. But that message is wrong. Highly personable, professional and an expert schmoozer, Delew is Levy's right-hand woman and the person in charge of Labour 2002, a fundraising idea taken from America, which focuses on raising money for the second term. When a list of Labour's 'millionaires' club' appeared in the papers, it was Delew's name that appeared at the bottom of it. On the list were Lord Haskins, the Labour peer and chairman of Northern Foods, the Simply Red lead singer Mick Hucknall and Alan McGee, the former head of Creation Records who has since let it be known that he has become disillusioned with the party. It is always a battle to keep donors on side. When Chris Evans announced that he was backing Ken Livingstone to be mayor of London, Labour thought they had lost a generous benefactor. But The Observer revealed in the autumn that he told campaign managers he was willing to come back into the Labour fold to the tune of \u00a31m. There were sighs of relief all round.

State funding is not a prophylactic against all corruption; witness the scandals associated with Helmut Kohl in Germany. The idea that one penny of taxpayers' money which might otherwise be spent on schools or hospitals should pay for party propaganda will revolt many voters, which is one of the reasons the notion is regarded nervously by the Prime Minister. Queasiness at the idea of tax subsidies for Millbank HQ and Conservative Central Office would be widespread. Revulsion would accompany the suggestion that tax pounds might fund fascists and trots, monster raving loons and yogic flyers.</p> <p>These are serious objections to state funding of parties, but not quite overwhelming. The most compelling reason to be wary is that it would effectively turn the parties into wholly owned subsidiaries of the state with even less incentive to recruit and engage a broad membership. Politicians would be further detached from the people; the people would be even more ingrained in their alienation from the politicians.</p> <p>Routinely, the politicians set themselves the ambition of rebuilding mass memberships. It was one of the special promises of Tony Blair when he became leader of his party as it was of William Hague when he was elevated to the chiefship of the Tories. As routinely, they have failed. Here, for once, money can be turned from corroding enemy of democracy into an agent of its regeneration. Place a strict cap on the size of any single donation. Force the parties to find their bread from lots of small donations from many members and supporters - or let them starve of cash.</p> <p>The total sums raised might well end up being smaller. But the impoverishment of the propagandists would be enriching of democracy. And, at the very least, we would be spared the screaming hoardings which are about to deaden us.</p>",

The idea that one penny of taxpayers' money which might otherwise be spent on schools or hospitals should pay for party propaganda will revolt many voters, which is one of the reasons the notion is regarded nervously by the Prime Minister. Queasiness at the idea of tax subsidies for Millbank HQ and Conservative Central Office would be widespread. Revulsion would accompany the suggestion that tax pounds might fund fascists and trots, monster raving loons and yogic flyers. These are serious objections to state funding of parties, but not quite overwhelming. The most compelling reason to be wary is that it would effectively turn the parties into wholly owned subsidiaries of the state with even less incentive to recruit and engage a broad membership. Politicians would be further detached from the people; the people would be even more ingrained in their alienation from the politicians. Routinely, the politicians set themselves the ambition of rebuilding mass memberships. It was one of the special promises of Tony Blair when he became leader of his party as it was of William Hague when he was elevated to the chiefship of the Tories. As routinely, they have failed. Here, for once, money can be turned from corroding enemy of democracy into an agent of its regeneration. Place a strict cap on the size of any single donation. Force the parties to find their bread from lots of small donations from many members and supporters - or let them starve of cash. The total sums raised might well end up being smaller. But the impoverishment of the propagandists would be enriching of democracy. And, at the very least, we would be spared the screaming hoardings which are about to deaden us.",

A year ago, he was convicted of murdering 15 women, but it was always thought that the actual number was higher; perhaps as high as 100, it was said, although that seemed far-fetched at the time. So when he was found guilty, there was none of the dramatic relief that is found in other such murder cases.</p> <p>The trial had been long, wretched and baffling, his presence in the dock tetchy and pedantic, and the ending left us with no sense of redemption or of understanding. We did not know how many of his patients he had killed in his 24 years as a GP. We did not know if we would ever know. And we did not know why he had killed any of his mostly elderly victims. It was an ungraspable horror, like a sheer cliff face with no finger holds. Last Friday, a Government dossier - product of a year's meticulous research - revealed that Harold Shipman may have killed as many as 265 of his patients. This figure has been arrived at through a clinical audit, comparing the medical records of Shipman with those of his fellow doctors in Manchester and Todmorden, West Yorkshire. His massacre was quiet and methodical. Most of the deaths occurred between noon and three in the afternoon. Assuming that the victims were all injected with diamorphine, they would not even have realised that they were dying.</p> <p>The possibility of a retrial has been pretty much ruled out - it would be impossible to get an objective jury, and many of the relevant documents have been destroyed or lost and many of the witnesses are now dead. Shipman himself, held in solitude at Frankland Prison, near Durham, for his own safety, has not spoken, despite appeals for help. The relatives of the potential victims are left suspended in brutal doubt and agony. For them, the Shipman trial will never be over.

He left a trail of death behind him. He cut a swathe through the community in which he lived as a revered family doctor. Yet he remains a weirdly unresonant figure, who baffles rather than horrifies us. On Friday morning, some of the newspapers led on the ghastly news; others placed it at the bottom of the page; still others put it in the middle of the paper, under a modestly-sized headline. Big Brother, delayed trains, flooded living-rooms, Madonna's private wedding: these things made as much or more impact than 265 people killed by one respectable man. By Saturday, the enormity of the new evidence had begun to sink in and several newspapers put Shipman on the front page.</p> <p>Nevertheless, his face - clerkish and bespectacled, with a scratchy beard and aggrieved stare - doesn't send a frisson of terror through us, the way that Myra Hindley's obscenely painted face does. He has not become one of our demons, not an icon of evil, and that's because he doesn't hold an evident meaning for us.</p> <p>Why is this? First, and most shamingly, the majority of Harold Shipman's victims and assumed victims were elderly and they were female, which gave them a double invisibility. Everyone's assumption, when Shipman was first arrested, was that he was a mercy-killer, easing sick patients out of a life they'd grown weary of.</p> <p>But even after we knew that this was not the case - that many of them were healthy and happy, liked their life, went out gardening and dancing and courting and visiting, were loved and loving and full of pluck and gaiety and quite unready to die - we were still not gripped by pity for the women he'd killed. They weren't children, sweet innocents slaughtered, nor were they beautiful young women. They weren't the stuff of tragedy for us. We think of life as a line, and the elderly at the end of it, with not much time left and so it didn't matter so very much that time was taken away. The old - even if we are old ourselves - are 'them', the silent others. We don't care enough.</p> <p>Then, Shipman was like a ghastly bureaucrat, a statistician at work. He injected his patients with a lethal dose of diamorphine as they sat docilely in their chairs, sleeves rolled up, trusting the good doctor. He didn't seem to have any reason at all - the trawl back through his life shows a diligent schoolboy who loved his mother and saw her die of cancer; the fact that he used to watch her being injected with the same pain-killing drugs that he later used to kill his patients is both riveting and unrevealing.</p> <p>His murders were not Gothic and tormented, the stuff of horror stories and dark fairy tales, but mute and with a ghastly decorum. He didn't kidnap them, torture them, sexually abuse them, mutilate them or cut them up. He didn't boil them or bury them vertically in his garden or basement. He never listened to them scream. He simply killed them, one by one, down the years.</p> <p>This means that we cannot identify either with the victims or with the killer. When James Bulger was lured away and killed, there was a mass empathy with the parents. We watched, over and over on the grainy loop of the security video, the toddler being led away, and we put ourselves in their shoes. We imagined it happening to us. We started being over-protective of our own children, gripping them firmly in supermarkets, not letting them out of our sight. The same happened with Sara Payne.</p> <p>Conversely, when the details emerged of the murders committed by Fred and Rosemary West, there was another - and far more disturbing - imaginative engagement that we had to grapple with. The Wests were murderous sexual sadists, performing unimaginable acts of torture on their young victims. But while there has never been a case quite like it, most of us have some understanding of sex as potentially dark and perverse and scarily powerful.</p> <p>The couple gave us a collective wince of terror, as if their monstrous actions offered a glimpse into a hidden side of our psyche.

The cut in American interest rates last week may have been to head off a potential sharp US recession, but the implications for Britain and Europe are awesome. It was the biggest potential setback for British Euro-sceptics for years. A 3 May general election after a budget with substantial income tax cuts now looks close to a racing certainty.</p> <p>The drama of the move drove home the realisation that matters must be serious. All last autumn, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, had been expressing his concerns about the need for growth in the American economy to decelerate and warning that interest rates might have to go higher. Central banks like to behave in an orderly way, and the next meeting to decide interest rates was not scheduled until the end of January.</p> <p>So when he held an emergency telephone conference call with his colleagues to justify a full half per cent cut last Wednesday morning, the action came out of the blue.</p> <p>The reason for the move, the Fed explained, was the mounting evidence from American factories and shopping malls that the economy was slowing down too fast - and that sharp strains were emerging in the financial markets. Companies other than absolute blue chips wanting to raise money were finding that the terms were prohibitive. After Tuesday's news that manufacturing activity had reached a nine-year low, the Wall Street consensus was that the Fed would cut rates soon; what nobody expected was that Greenspan would act the following day. After all, his last public utterance in early December was still to say that there should be no let-up.</p> <p>The first reaction of the markets was to cheer; they had been underwritten by the man who has attained the status of a monetary god. Then fears and second thoughts set in. If Greenspan could reverse his judgment within a month that rates might have to go higher still, things must be even more dire than they thought. If a serious recession is on its way, or the collapse of a major financial institution, the policy response will need to be more than a mere half per cent cut in interest rates. Maybe America's longest-ever boom is coming to an end - and then what?</p> <p>It is hard to overestimate just how accustomed the US has been to the good times; the story has been that the new, information-based economy stands as the guarantor of years of above-average growth with associated low unemployment. Last year, American consumers stopped saving altogether; November broached a new record - the whole nation spent 0.8 per cent more than it earned for the first time in its history. They felt they didn't have to worry. Employment was certain and wages were rising, and the buoyancy in Wall Street and the housing market made everyone feel like a mini Paul Getty.</p> <p>But America has been reaching the limits. American consumers now carry an average of $8,000 (\u00a35,300) debt on their credit cards and their overall indebtedness has never been higher. This Christmas, it became obvious that, even without saving a dime, they could not maintain the momentum of consumption. As the orders have slowed down, so American manufacturers have begun to lay off workers. The trouble, as Greenspan recognised, is that economic declines once started tend to feed off themselves unless corrected.</p> <p>But if that was not enough, the American financial system is beginning to show strains. Two hundred dotcom companies went bankrupt last year alone, eliminating up to $15 billion of venture capital investment at a stroke. The investment community has been stunned, and it is now as hard to raise money as once it was easy. If just one bank or fund in the credit chain goes belly-up because it is carrying too many losses, suddenly the integrity of the financial system becomes weakened. This, I am sure, was the clincher for Greenspan. In these conditions, central bankers move to cheaper money and quickly.</p> <p>It is now certain that there will be a sharp economic slowdown over the next 18 months, even if interest rates are cut more and the incoming Bush administration manages to get some hefty tax reductions through Congress to have an impact this year - by no means certain. Indeed, given the indebtedness of American consumers and the unsustainable, bubble-like levels of Wall Street, an American recession is highly likely; this has gone beyond the capacity of policy to correct in the short term.</p> <p>In some respects, a recession is even needed, an argument volunteered by Morgan Stanley's chief economist, Stephen Roach. American consumers, business and the investment community need to retrench and learn some prudence, he argues. Roach is right - but only up to a point. The US has over-extended itself, and if the economic decline kicks in too quickly it will bankrupt companies, banks and even some states' unemployment insurance funds. New York and Texas, for example, have assumed that full employment is permanent and allowed their unemployment insurance funds to operate with negligible reserves to finance tax cuts; a small rise in unemployment would render both state funds insolvent. Twelve other states are in the same position. The unemployed would not get their entitlements, weakening demand and intensifying recession further.</p> <p>My own hunch is that these multiple effects from over-extension, ranging from unreserved unemployment insurance funds to over-lent banks, are more likely to cause a deep and protracted recession than a virtuous slowdown - and Greenspan's action shows that at least he sees the same risk. Nor is the incoming Bush administration, with its inbuilt prejudice against proactive action apart from tax cuts, remotely capable of handling the complexity of the strains. America should prepare for the worst.</p> <p>Britain and Europe will not avoid the fall-out, but we are in nothing like such a precarious position. Indeed, in Britain, Chancellor Gordon Brown now has the reason - if he needed one - to use some of his extraordinary unanticipated budget surplus to finance yet higher government spending and more tax cuts to counter the recessionary impact from the US. He always planned to enter the next election with a 20p standard rate of income tax; now he is offered the perfect rationale - to sustain consumer spending to support an otherwise slowing-down economy. The Blair/Brown Government is emerging as one of the luckiest since the war.</p> <p>Arguments over the euro have been transformed. The single currency has jumped more than 10 per cent against the dollar since November; it will rise further. More than five million jobs have been generated in the European Union since 1997 and the pace is accelerating - just as American job generation proves to be the ephemeral side-effect of an unsustainable bubble economy.</p> <p>The EU's steady growth this year and next will look good beside the deep travails of the US, and the old argument about sclerotic, out-of-date, backward-looking Europe compared to the new economy of the US will be turned on its head. Small wonder the leaders of the Shadow Cabinet are no longer on speaking terms; they face an electoral disaster, and even their one ace - Euro-scepticism - is looking jaded.</p> <p>But New Labour will take care to call the election soon while the economy is still looking good. The chances are that the US recession will not extend to Britain, but in an era of globalisation nobody can be sure what recessionary transmission mechanisms might develop. In other words, go for a general election on 3 May. These are interesting times, but not if you are a Tory.</p>",

The Blair/Brown Government is emerging as one of the luckiest since the war. Arguments over the euro have been transformed. The single currency has jumped more than 10 per cent against the dollar since November; it will rise further. More than five million jobs have been generated in the European Union since 1997 and the pace is accelerating - just as American job generation proves to be the ephemeral side-effect of an unsustainable bubble economy. The EU's steady growth this year and next will look good beside the deep travails of the US, and the old argument about sclerotic, out-of-date, backward-looking Europe compared to the new economy of the US will be turned on its head. Small wonder the leaders of the Shadow Cabinet are no longer on speaking terms; they face an electoral disaster, and even their one ace - Euro-scepticism - is looking jaded. But New Labour will take care to call the election soon while the economy is still looking good. The chances are that the US recession will not extend to Britain, but in an era of globalisation nobody can be sure what recessionary transmission mechanisms might develop. In other words, go for a general election on 3 May. These are interesting times, but not if you are a Tory.",

Most want to buy now, with delivery in 48 hours.'</p> <p>At its flotation, on Germany's Neuer Markt last July, LetsBuyIt had another key part of the internet dream: a fancy business plan, setting out spectacular growth. Founded in Sweden just two years ago, the firm promised to break even by mid-2002 and move strongly into profit in 2003. But take a closer look at the key assumptions underlying the projections and the dream turns to fantasy. </p> <p>First, compound revenue growth was forecast at a gravity-defying 147 per cent over the first four years. After notching up sales of just \u00a31.4 million in its first 12 months, LetsBuyIt had gullible investors believe it was going to rewrite the record books, with \u00a3460m of sales by 2003. </p> <p>Second, from negative territory, gross profit margins would leap to a sustainable 25 per cent by 2002 - dizzy heights of which most retailers can but dream. 'I remember looking at the figures and thinking \"you must be on drugs\",' says Heidi Fitzpatrick, internet analyst with broker Lehman Bros, one of the few City scribblers to emerge with credit from an all-too familiar saga.</p> <p>To any common sense observer, LetsBuyIt was in deep trouble long before it came to market. For starters, founder John Palmer - who had a background in the Australian toy trade - and his Swedish backers followed Boo.com's lead by setting up in 14 countries all at once. From the outset, with 350 staff, overheads ran ahead of reality. The loss-making Danish operation has yet to make a single kroner of sales, while in Germany - LetsBuyIt's biggest market - its business model was illegal under ancient anti-discounting laws that protect small shopkeepers.</p> <p>By the summer, the firm had already blown most of the \u00a375m it had raised from backers. Despite the recruitment of a heavyweight top team including former Nike boss John Coles, the flotation had also already been put off twice. On the last occasion, in May, the plug was pulled just a day after a juvenile marketing stunt in which Turner and her man-sized ants were barred by the old dears at the Chelsea Flower Show.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, the flotation raised just \u00a341m, less than half what the profligate business plan intended and at half the price per share. LetsBuyIt blames changed sentiment towards dotcoms for its demise: it failed because of events beyond its control.</p> <p>What nonsense. The market's reaction is a logical response to irrational over-exuberance in the first place. But take a look, too, at LetsBuyIt's last results, for the quarter to end September. Sales and gross profits were up 28 per cent to \u00a35.8m and \u00a3570,000 respectively.</p> <p>But what's this buried in marketing, advertising and promotions? Just \u00a3930,000 of subsidy - more than its profits - for free deliveries which anyone else would deduct from the gross margin. As Lehman's Fitzpatrick puts its: 'If you're losing money every time you ship a product, you're in trouble.'</p> <p>And then came Christmas. For 1999's festive season, LetsBuyIt barely had an offering. The accountants are now investigating how it fared over Christmas 2000, but the omens are not good. The 'trouble' with Christmas is that people want presents now, not in two weeks or a month. So out of the window went the model, and LetsBuyIt started to buy stock directly. By the end of September it already had \u00a31.6m worth on its books. How much unsold - or returned - stock it now has remains to be seen.</p> <p>By October, LetsBuyIt still had to sell another \u00a317m worth of goods to make its \u00a330m flotation forecast. Last week's abrupt resignation and departure of Coles and his team suggests things went badly wrong. Last week, the internet's bulletin boards were abuzz with tales of how LetsBuyIt ruined many a consumer's Christmas.</p> <p>Before it shut down, the firm's website boasted well over a million members. But less than a fifth ever bought anything. Many of the newer recruits were just signing up for the free \u00a35 Amazon books voucher. At the end, however, LetsBuyIt was not even delivering those.</p>",

On the last occasion, in May, the plug was pulled just a day after a juvenile marketing stunt in which Turner and her man-sized ants were barred by the old dears at the Chelsea Flower Show. Not surprisingly, the flotation raised just \u00a341m, less than half what the profligate business plan intended and at half the price per share. LetsBuyIt blames changed sentiment towards dotcoms for its demise: it failed because of events beyond its control. What nonsense. The market's reaction is a logical response to irrational over-exuberance in the first place. But take a look, too, at LetsBuyIt's last results, for the quarter to end September. Sales and gross profits were up 28 per cent to \u00a35.8m and \u00a3570,000 respectively. But what's this buried in marketing, advertising and promotions? Just \u00a3930,000 of subsidy - more than its profits - for free deliveries which anyone else would deduct from the gross margin. As Lehman's Fitzpatrick puts its: 'If you're losing money every time you ship a product, you're in trouble.' And then came Christmas. For 1999's festive season, LetsBuyIt barely had an offering. The accountants are now investigating how it fared over Christmas 2000, but the omens are not good. The 'trouble' with Christmas is that people want presents now, not in two weeks or a month. So out of the window went the model, and LetsBuyIt started to buy stock directly. By the end of September it already had \u00a31.6m worth on its books. How much unsold - or returned - stock it now has remains to be seen. By October, LetsBuyIt still had to sell another \u00a317m worth of goods to make its \u00a330m flotation forecast. Last week's abrupt resignation and departure of Coles and his team suggests things went badly wrong. Last week, the internet's bulletin boards were abuzz with tales of how LetsBuyIt ruined many a consumer's Christmas. Before it shut down, the firm's website boasted well over a million members. But less than a fifth ever bought anything. Many of the newer recruits were just signing up for the free \u00a35 Amazon books voucher. At the end, however, LetsBuyIt was not even delivering those.",

Too obviously doomed to failure, we tell ourselves, puffing away, happily. And so the cycle of procrastination and denial goes on.

It wasn't a decision I took lightly. In fact, it wasn't a decision I took at all. It all started with a vicious bout of flu, which left me literally unable to lift a lighter for several days.

And when you talk, it's not in terms of health, expense or thinning skin, all you really want to know, the only question on your lips is: 'If I did give up, would you still like me?' </p> <p>That's the truly terrifying thing about giving up smoking, and which few dare speak about. Forget the oft-reported downsides of nicotine withdrawal. It's not that they aren't true - they are. I am cranky, irritable, unreasonable, twitchy and foul tempered, and, yes, I do get worse when I'm not smoking. However, for some of us, there is deeper, more existential stuff to worry about. Maybe not so much a case of 'Would you still like me?', rather 'Would I still be me?' For all real smokers, there is the very real fear that the very second we stop smoking, the instant our little brown tipped crutch is kicked away, half our personality would automatically disappear, and no one would ever see any point in talking to us ever again. </p> <p>Of course, there are plenty of situations where I'm not able to smoke, and I cope fine. Moreover, if you drink, you still have several different personalities available whenever you want. But where's the fun in that, if you can't smoke as well?

Without smoking, I know I'm social toast. It's easy to appear likable when you smoke, because, however dull you might be yourself, you instantly get access to the nicotine-stained inner sanctum, where all the interesting, charming, rebellious, cynical people are.

And there you sit together, smoking and smiling at each other, and saying things like: 'Need a light?' or 'Anyone got a light?', or 'Cheers (for the light).' Which probably doesn't sound like much to non-smokers out there, but it's making me well up just thinking about it. It's so unfair.

And now apparently they have bought their own field from a local farmer, and with the \u00a3850,000 they have scraped together from the tombola and car-boot sales have transformed it into an area of outstanding... well, admittedly it's a bit of a quagmire at the moment, but when the trees and grass have grown a bit and they've bought some rounders bats and goalposts and so on, it will be hard to imagine that this corner of England was once all turnips or, more likely, that horrible yellow stuff that plays havoc with people's sinuses. Trouble is they're still short of \u00a3150,000, says Mr Cook. 'Don't look at me,' I say. By now we're all politely trailing after the headmaster with our hands folded behind our backs in the pouring rain as he escorts Kate Hoey and our own town dignitaries on an inspection of breeze blocks and lumps of wood and Portakabins while the bricklayers flit around taking a sudden interest in their work. At last Kate is ready to wield the ceremonial trowel and make a rousing speech celebrating a new era for sport after an uphill struggle through a funding minefield, not to mention the pitfalls and hurdles of other things. 'Fuck!' comes a muffled cry from somewhere, which seems a bit ungracious after Kate has come all this way, but it turns out to be just one of the workmen dropping his hod on someone's foot. Luckily the minister has now moved on to give a humorous account of the last time she visited and the headmaster's car got stuck in the mud and they had to be rescued by the school tractor. How everyone laughed, except Mr Watkin, head of PE, who had to clean her shoes. Finally the stone is laid. Kate demonstrates her pointing skills for the photographer before shooting off to change all the Byzantine laws which prevent worthwhile projects like this not being able to get Lottery money while the rest of us head back to school for wine and gourmet snacks. Excellent. There's nothing like double games to give you an appetite. phil.hogan@observer.co.uk",

It is Bart Simpson with his trademark yellow spiky hair and toothy grin. So far, so unremarkable. But there's more. There is a cartoon donkey and - oh, how droll - Bart and the beast are doing something that would give Homer and Marge a heart attack. It raises a half-hearted smile. You hit the delete key and think nothing more of it. </p> <p>Looking at pictures of cartoon characters in compromising positions with cartoon farmyard animals may not be the funniest or most original thing to happen in an average working day. Getting sacked for your 30 seconds of animated smut will certainly provoke a serious sense of humour failure. </p> <p>But who would fire someone over such a prank, and how would they know? Your employer, for one. You may not know it, but from the second you log on in the morning to the moment you switch off at night, your boss is looking over your shoulder. If you are reading this article on The Observer website, your IT department will know you are. If you use the email address at the bottom of this article, your boss can read what you write. </p> <p>Every day millions of emails are being intercepted, quarantined, analysed and, if the company e-police do not like what they see, staff are being handed a P45 and a binbag. It happened last week to 10 people who worked at the Royal &amp; Sun Alliance insurance firm in Liverpool. A further 80 have been suspended in the finance and administration departments. </p> <p>Those who lost their jobs were junior clerical staff, but it is not just the vulnerable and low-paid who are being caught out. The Liverpool 10 share their notoriety with four lawyers suspended last month by top City law firm Norton Rose after an email about oral sex circulated around the company before being forwarded to more than 20 million people worldwide. Even the editor of the Mirror, Piers Morgan, has had his inbox examined by his bosses while investigating alleged financial impropriety. </p> <p>In July the Regulation and Investigatory Powers Act was passed. It said employers could read employees' emails, but only with their consent. But in October Department of Trade and Industry guidelines gave employers the right to monitor emails without asking first. With unseemly haste, employers are using the new rules to amend existing employee contracts, inserting new internet and email clauses that state: 'Messages are not the private property of employees and there should be no expectation of privacy in any circumstances,' or: 'Your employer reserves the right to access and monitor all messages created, sent, received or stored on your employer's systems.' </p> <p>Some companies are even going so far as to introduce 'Spywear' technology, which monitors every key stroke and mouse click an employee makes. It enables bosses to trawl through the text of every email sent or received, every web page viewed, looking for large expanses of flesh tones or simply colourful language. Employers can also flip to what is on any employee's screen at any time. </p> <p>Companies insist the crackdown is necessary because staff are wasting time by surfing the internet and sending emails. Without saying where they get their figures, they claim 60 per cent of online shopping and 90 per cent of hits on pornographic sites are in office hours. They also argue that they are responsible for the content of any messages sent out on their networks. Mike Emmott, of the Institute of Personnel and Development, says: 'If people are spending a lot of time at work not working, it is not surprising if managers take action.' </p> <p>As recently as a year ago it did not seem to matter much what employers looked at. Email and the internet were still in their relative infancy but over the past year there has been an explosion in e-traffic. Telephone companies announced recently that their networks were carrying more data traffic than voice traffic. The desktop telephone is rapidly being replaced by the desktop computer. </p> <p>More than 15 million people have access to the internet and 36 per cent of employees have an email address supplied by their employer. What's more, email has a peculiar power to get us to open up. Cut off from the face-to-face of normal conversation, we are more informal. Helen Petrie, an internet psychologist at Hertfordshire University, says: 'People find email very dis-inhibiting. They bash out a message and send things they would not dream of doing over the phone or in a letter.' </p> <p>As more of us communicate by email, IT specialists say firms are overreacting and violating employees' legitimate rights to privacy at work. Dr Simon Moores, an internet expert, says: 'The balance is totally in favour of big business. That is wrong. Constant surveillance is sinister and invasive. The world is changing and we need to think hard about employees' rights and privileges in this wired world. We are rapidly becoming the Western world's leading surveillance society.' </p> <p>Caspar Bowden, of the Foundation for Information Policy Research, adds: 'Bullying bosses can intimidate staff and exploit knowledge of their private lives.' </p> <p>Workplace snooping is not only intrusive, psychologists say, it is bad for business. 'Employees have always chatted in the office,' says Cary Cooper, Professor of Organisational Psychology and Health at Manchester University. 'It is no surprise they use new technology like the internet and email to do so. Employers might think it is a good idea to try to control it but the evidence shows the more people feel monitored and distrusted, the more productivity declines.' </p> <p>Employers are winning the battle to control cyberspace but the backlash is growing. Lawyers say the Regulation and Investigatory Powers Act conflicts with the Data Protection Act. It may also be against the spirit of the European Convention on Human Rights, guaranteeing a 'right to privacy'. The law will be tested in a series of industrial tribunals later this year. </p> <p>In the workplace itself, staff are using new technology to beat employers at their own game. Free websites such as <a href=\"http://www.hushmail.com\">Hushmail</a> and <a href=\"http://www.safeweb.com\">Safeweb</a> encrypt email and web surfing. </p> <p>Back in Liverpool the 10 sacked workers will this week fight to get their jobs back. One told The Observer : 'What the company has done is an absurd overreaction. If we cracked a joke or passed a cartoon picture around, nothing would have happened. People have mortgages and children to think about. Just because it is on email everyone seems to have gone mad.' </p> <p>Office smut has certainly come a long way from tacky pin-ups of half-naked women and whispered dirty jokes. The battle over who has the right to say what is unsavoury and what is simply harmless banter has only just begun. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:john.arlidge@observer.co.uk\">john.arlidge@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

Your employer, for one. You may not know it, but from the second you log on in the morning to the moment you switch off at night, your boss is looking over your shoulder. If you are reading this article on The Observer website, your IT department will know you are. If you use the email address at the bottom of this article, your boss can read what you write. Every day millions of emails are being intercepted, quarantined, analysed and, if the company e-police do not like what they see, staff are being handed a P45 and a binbag. It happened last week to 10 people who worked at the Royal &amp; Sun Alliance insurance firm in Liverpool. A further 80 have been suspended in the finance and administration departments. Those who lost their jobs were junior clerical staff, but it is not just the vulnerable and low-paid who are being caught out. The Liverpool 10 share their notoriety with four lawyers suspended last month by top City law firm Norton Rose after an email about oral sex circulated around the company before being forwarded to more than 20 million people worldwide. Even the editor of the Mirror, Piers Morgan, has had his inbox examined by his bosses while investigating alleged financial impropriety. In July the Regulation and Investigatory Powers Act was passed. It said employers could read employees' emails, but only with their consent. But in October Department of Trade and Industry guidelines gave employers the right to monitor emails without asking first. With unseemly haste, employers are using the new rules to amend existing employee contracts, inserting new internet and email clauses that state: 'Messages are not the private property of employees and there should be no expectation of privacy in any circumstances,' or: 'Your employer reserves the right to access and monitor all messages created, sent, received or stored on your employer's systems.' Some companies are even going so far as to introduce 'Spywear' technology, which monitors every key stroke and mouse click an employee makes. It enables bosses to trawl through the text of every email sent or received, every web page viewed, looking for large expanses of flesh tones or simply colourful language. Employers can also flip to what is on any employee's screen at any time. Companies insist the crackdown is necessary because staff are wasting time by surfing the internet and sending emails. Without saying where they get their figures, they claim 60 per cent of online shopping and 90 per cent of hits on pornographic sites are in office hours. They also argue that they are responsible for the content of any messages sent out on their networks. Mike Emmott, of the Institute of Personnel and Development, says: 'If people are spending a lot of time at work not working, it is not surprising if managers take action.' As recently as a year ago it did not seem to matter much what employers looked at. Email and the internet were still in their relative infancy but over the past year there has been an explosion in e-traffic. Telephone companies announced recently that their networks were carrying more data traffic than voice traffic. The desktop telephone is rapidly being replaced by the desktop computer. More than 15 million people have access to the internet and 36 per cent of employees have an email address supplied by their employer. What's more, email has a peculiar power to get us to open up. Cut off from the face-to-face of normal conversation, we are more informal. Helen Petrie, an internet psychologist at Hertfordshire University, says: 'People find email very dis-inhibiting. They bash out a message and send things they would not dream of doing over the phone or in a letter.' As more of us communicate by email, IT specialists say firms are overreacting and violating employees' legitimate rights to privacy at work. Dr Simon Moores, an internet expert, says: 'The balance is totally in favour of big business. That is wrong. Constant surveillance is sinister and invasive. The world is changing and we need to think hard about employees' rights and privileges in this wired world. We are rapidly becoming the Western world's leading surveillance society.' Caspar Bowden, of the Foundation for Information Policy Research, adds: 'Bullying bosses can intimidate staff and exploit knowledge of their private lives.' Workplace snooping is not only intrusive, psychologists say, it is bad for business. 'Employees have always chatted in the office,' says Cary Cooper, Professor of Organisational Psychology and Health at Manchester University. 'It is no surprise they use new technology like the internet and email to do so. Employers might think it is a good idea to try to control it but the evidence shows the more people feel monitored and distrusted, the more productivity declines.' Employers are winning the battle to control cyberspace but the backlash is growing. Lawyers say the Regulation and Investigatory Powers Act conflicts with the Data Protection Act. It may also be against the spirit of the European Convention on Human Rights, guaranteeing a 'right to privacy'. The law will be tested in a series of industrial tribunals later this year. In the workplace itself, staff are using new technology to beat employers at their own game. Free websites such as Hushmail and Safeweb encrypt email and web surfing. Back in Liverpool the 10 sacked workers will this week fight to get their jobs back. One told The Observer : 'What the company has done is an absurd overreaction. If we cracked a joke or passed a cartoon picture around, nothing would have happened. People have mortgages and children to think about. Just because it is on email everyone seems to have gone mad.' Office smut has certainly come a long way from tacky pin-ups of half-naked women and whispered dirty jokes. The battle over who has the right to say what is unsavoury and what is simply harmless banter has only just begun. john.arlidge@observer.co.uk",

As air traffic controllers admit they are 'losing it' because of the huge rise in flights, the report prepared for the European Commission and transport ministers, including Britain's John Prescott, calls for new safety measures to be given 'immediate priority'. Faced with severe inefficiencies and a disturbing shortage of staff, the report also warns of 'gridlock' in the skies over Europe as creaking infrastructure and 50-year-old procedures fail to cope with exponential traffic growth. The commission is likely to receive the final report, entitled 'Single European Sky' and prepared by aviation experts and military representatives from across the European Union, later this month and order fresh legislation to ease overcrowding and safety fears. Among the report's most powerful recommendations, it demands: \u0095 A European safety supremo, in the form of an independent safety regulator, should be appointed; \u0095 A safety action programme should be drawn up to expand capacity safely; \u0095 An immediate 'non-punitive' safety reporting system should be introduced for controllers and pilots; \u0095 More resources should be poured into modern technology and procedures, to replace a 'patchwork' of different systems with a 'seamless, single sky'; \u0095 Military aircraft should exercise outside busy passenger traffic areas; \u0095 More air traffic controllers should be urgently recruited and existing staff better trained. The report says legislation to force urgent improvements to safety should be ordered this year, with all reforms implemented by 2005. Senior air traffic controllers at the busiest centres - London, Brussels and Maastricht - told The Observer that staff numbers are shrinking as hundreds of ex-air force personnel recruited in the Sixties and Seventies are queuing up to retire at a time when annual passenger traffic over Europe is poised to more than double to 16 million flights over the next two decades. The air traffic control union IPMS estimates that in the busiest areas and at peak times there are up to one-third fewer controllers than needed for maximum safety and efficiency.

Although Britain is currently training 120 new controllers a year and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) claims this will be enough to manage traffic 'for the foreseeable future', others disagree and say that more ageing controllers are likely to retire than the authority realises. A new radar centre at Swanwick, Hampshire, due to open five years late in January 2002, is likely to put severe restrictions on capacity in its early months because of staff shortages, it is claimed. Controllers in the UK and on the Continent said that the pressure to handle ever-increasing numbers of flights has led to: \u0095 More aircraft 'busting' their official flight levels because of controller and pilot error but failing to report it; \u0095 Radio communications between radar centres and pilots being cut to the minimum - often with no time for pilots to read instructions back to controllers for accuracy checks; \u0095 Aircraft being cleared to land at airports when it is too late for the pilot to abort the landing if there is a problem; \u0095 Pilots under pressure to land before the runway is clear of a previous jet taxiing to the terminal, and under pressure not to 'go around' for another landing attempt because it will delay things on the ground. \u0095 Controllers feeling 'wrecked' just halfway through a two-hour stint at the radar because of traffic overloading, resulting in extreme stress and less margin for error. Staff at the West Drayton control centre near Heathrow Airport have reported finishing shifts admitting they 'lost it' at times while on duty because they had had so many aircraft to manage they didn't know how they had brought them through safely. More than 100 incidents a month are being reported to the CAA confidentially. On the Continent, where radar centres handle millions of flights to and from the UK, one senior European controller said: 'There has been an increase of incidents and serious incidents around airports and in mid-air in recent years, and sooner or later we are not going to be talking about an incident but about an accident - a big bang. 'The only way that the number of controllers in the busy areas of Europe can handle all the flights is to have zero growth in traffic over the next five years - but it is growing at 7 per cent and in some major areas over Belgium and the Netherlands by 15 per cent.' The 'Single European Sky' report talks bluntly of a 'chronic shortage' of controllers leading to 'intense work pressure'.

      "body": "<p>Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator, was allowed to escape extradition to Spain on 2 March last year because of plans worked out over many months by Tony Blair and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook in collaboration with Eduardo Frei, then President of Chile, according to leading Chilean sources. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar, the conservative Prime Minister of Spain and his Foreign Minister Abel Matutes, were involved in the planning.</p> <p>'The freeing of Pinochet was a political decision taken by the British Government,' Hern\u00e1n Montealegre, Chile's leading human rights lawyer, told The Observer yesterday. If the medical report which Home Secretary Jack Straw used to justify the former dictator's release had been tested in the courts, it would not have stood up, he claimed.</p> <p>Pinochet faces summary arrest today for contempt of court, having refused to submit to the medical examination ordered by Juan Guzm\u00e1n, the examining judge dealing with the 1973 Caravan of Death case in which the former dictator is implicated. Pinochet faces an additional 202 charges which relate to other crimes.</p> <p>The Blair-Frei plan was to prevent Pinochet's extradition while observing the law. Instead, the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary relied on Britain's wide discretion on extradition matters.</p> <p>The plan was conceived in 1999 after it became clear that the Pinochet affair was dragging on far longer than governments expected and came to fruition when British doctors examined the General at Northwick Park Hospital in Harrow, north London, on 5 January last year. Their report allowed Straw to exercise his discretion to release Pinochet on humanitarian grounds even though the former dictator had never said he was too ill to stand trial.</p> <p>The medical report was leaked in February after the High Court in London forced an unwilling Straw to disclose it to the Spanish and other governments. It was widely criticised as skimpy and unconvincing by experts in geriatrics in Britain and on the continent, particularly by the Belgian government which, with Switzerland and France, was also seeking Pinochet's extradition on grave charges.</p> <p>The plan evolved in discussions round the world - in London, Madrid, Santiago, Rio de Janeiro, at United Nations headquarters in New York and in Auckland, the capital of New Zealand.</p> <p>The Observer has reconstructed the moves which allowed a dictator notorious for murder and torture to escape trial in Spain last year.</p> <p>On 2 November 1998, shortly after Pinochet's arrest when it was expected that he would be speedily sent to Spain, Blair and Aznar met in Downing Street and it was announced that Spain would collaborate fully with the extradition proceedings. 'We will apply judicial decisions,' said Francisco Alvarez Cascos, Aznar's deputy. The legal wrangles continued into 1999.</p> <p>By mid-1999 a new stratagem emerged when Frei, had a long telephone conversation with Blair in which the Chilean sought help in getting Pinochet released back to Chile on humanitarian grounds. According to a book just published in Santiago, Augusto Pinochet: 503 Dias Atrapado en Londres (Augusto Pinochet: 503 Days Trapped in London) by Monica P\u00e9rez, a leading Chilean TV journalist and Felipe Gertdtzen, the son-in-law of Frei, the Chilean President was keen to achieve Pinochet's return to Chile before his term ended in 2000.</p> <p>Frei argued to Blair that neither government would benefit if Pinochet were to die in England and that he could be tried in Chilean courts. According to the book, Blair emphasised to Frei that the case was before the courts and the Government could not interfere, adding that any British leader would court grave problems at home if he were seen to interfere with the course of justice. If there were any powers which Government could exercise they would be exercised by a Home Secretary not a Prime Minister, he said.

      "bodyText": "Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator, was allowed to escape extradition to Spain on 2 March last year because of plans worked out over many months by Tony Blair and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook in collaboration with Eduardo Frei, then President of Chile, according to leading Chilean sources. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar, the conservative Prime Minister of Spain and his Foreign Minister Abel Matutes, were involved in the planning. 'The freeing of Pinochet was a political decision taken by the British Government,' Hern\u00e1n Montealegre, Chile's leading human rights lawyer, told The Observer yesterday. If the medical report which Home Secretary Jack Straw used to justify the former dictator's release had been tested in the courts, it would not have stood up, he claimed. Pinochet faces summary arrest today for contempt of court, having refused to submit to the medical examination ordered by Juan Guzm\u00e1n, the examining judge dealing with the 1973 Caravan of Death case in which the former dictator is implicated. Pinochet faces an additional 202 charges which relate to other crimes. The Blair-Frei plan was to prevent Pinochet's extradition while observing the law. Instead, the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary relied on Britain's wide discretion on extradition matters. The plan was conceived in 1999 after it became clear that the Pinochet affair was dragging on far longer than governments expected and came to fruition when British doctors examined the General at Northwick Park Hospital in Harrow, north London, on 5 January last year. Their report allowed Straw to exercise his discretion to release Pinochet on humanitarian grounds even though the former dictator had never said he was too ill to stand trial. The medical report was leaked in February after the High Court in London forced an unwilling Straw to disclose it to the Spanish and other governments. It was widely criticised as skimpy and unconvincing by experts in geriatrics in Britain and on the continent, particularly by the Belgian government which, with Switzerland and France, was also seeking Pinochet's extradition on grave charges. The plan evolved in discussions round the world - in London, Madrid, Santiago, Rio de Janeiro, at United Nations headquarters in New York and in Auckland, the capital of New Zealand. The Observer has reconstructed the moves which allowed a dictator notorious for murder and torture to escape trial in Spain last year. On 2 November 1998, shortly after Pinochet's arrest when it was expected that he would be speedily sent to Spain, Blair and Aznar met in Downing Street and it was announced that Spain would collaborate fully with the extradition proceedings. 'We will apply judicial decisions,' said Francisco Alvarez Cascos, Aznar's deputy. The legal wrangles continued into 1999. By mid-1999 a new stratagem emerged when Frei, had a long telephone conversation with Blair in which the Chilean sought help in getting Pinochet released back to Chile on humanitarian grounds. According to a book just published in Santiago, Augusto Pinochet: 503 Dias Atrapado en Londres (Augusto Pinochet: 503 Days Trapped in London) by Monica P\u00e9rez, a leading Chilean TV journalist and Felipe Gertdtzen, the son-in-law of Frei, the Chilean President was keen to achieve Pinochet's return to Chile before his term ended in 2000. Frei argued to Blair that neither government would benefit if Pinochet were to die in England and that he could be tried in Chilean courts. According to the book, Blair emphasised to Frei that the case was before the courts and the Government could not interfere, adding that any British leader would court grave problems at home if he were seen to interfere with the course of justice. If there were any powers which Government could exercise they would be exercised by a Home Secretary not a Prime Minister, he said. Blair undertook to do what he could within the law provided the exchanges between the two leaders were kept secret. The authors claim that Blair suggested setting up a 'back channel', with two people appointed to liaise between the leaders' private offices. Frei's phone call followed a discussion on the Pinochet case in Rio at the Europe-Latin America summit between Chilean Foreign Minister Juan Gabriel Valdes and Cook. The two had got on well. Valdes and Cook continued their discussions at a meeting in September 1999 in the New Zealand capital, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office confirmed yesterday. They met again later that month at the UN in New York. Valdes had also met Spanish Foreign Minister Matutes at the Rio summit, where the pair laid the foundations for the Spanish government's later sabotage of the efforts of Judge Baltasar Garz\u00f3n to have Pinochet extradited to Spain. Aznar's government, worried about threats against Spanish investment in Chile, refused to transmit Garz\u00f3n's instructions to the Crown Prosecution Service last January, an action for which Matutes was taken to court in Madrid in February last year. Aznar has a close relationship with Blair and the two men and their wives Cherie and Ana have twice been on holiday together in Spain since April 1998. The contact man between Frei and Blair was Cristian Tolosa, Frei's press chief, who made six visits to London in the second half of 1999, liaising with Blair's aide Jonathan Powell at Number 10. Yesterday, Downing Street said that it did not comment on contacts between officials. Originally, Pinochet, proud of his physical fitness, refused to submit to the medical tests Frei wanted him to undergo. It took the dispatch of two Chilean generals, Juan Emilio Cheyre and Carlos Molina, to convince him to accept being medically examined, even by Chileans. The results of the Chilean examination were presented to the British, together with a memorandum on British extradition law prepared by the Chileans. Straw then went ahead with the second, much- criticised medical examination of Pinochet by British doctors which enabled the Home Secretary to refuse extradition on humanitarian grounds. Until Pinochet's departure from Britain, the Government rejected insistent calls from Amnesty International and others that it should itself charge Pinochet under the UN Convention against Torture - rather than merely respond to an initiative by a Spanish court.",

His symptoms are ones that Cop would recognise immediately, most prominent among them chronic fatigue.</p> <p>'After I became ill in August 1996 I was referred to the military medical services,' Cop said last week. 'My white blood cell count was three times what it should be. The military doctors said I was ill, but they did not know what from.</p> <p>'That is when I began investigating for myself. I got in contact with a German doctor who had been studying the effects of depleted uranium in the Gulf and he told me American forces had used depleted uranium ammunition during the Bosnian war. The Americans denied it. Now they admit it's true.'</p> <p>In seven days the safety of the depleted uranium ammunition has become an international controversy, attracting competing charges of a US cover-up over the danger the ammunition poses and dangerous claims of 'scaremongering'. After a decade of inconclusive research had mostly ruled out any link between depleted uranium ammunition and cancers - and counter-claims alleging that it had caused thousands of cancers among Iraqi children - investigations into the health implications are suddenly under way in Belgium, Italy, France and Turkey; in Finland, Sweden, Portugal and Spain.</p> <p>Among those who have demanded an investigation are Italy's Prime Minister Giuliano Amato who has called for a US moratorium on the use of depleted uranium shells - rejected by the Pentagon - and EU Commission President Romano Prodi who called for the banning of the ammunition if even the slightest risk was identified.</p> <p>In response, Nato's Secretary-General Lord Robertson has promised the Italians to provide information on its use of the ammunition in the Balkans.

Or whether they have seriously underestimated its danger.</p> <p>One organisation, at least is unconvinced, by their reassurances. On Friday the UN High Commissioner for Refugees confirmed its policy was to warn all staff travelling to Kosovo - and pregnant women in particular - of the potential risks of exposure to debris from depleted uranium still in the province.</p> <p>The answer to the question of whether depleted uranium ammunition is really safe may not lie in the bomb craters of Kosovo and Serbia. Instead, some experts believe, it is likely to be found in an area of barren Iraqi desert near the border with Kuwait, a place littered with remains of the last great land battle of the twentieth century - Operation Desert Storm.</p> <p>It was here that depleted uranium ammunition was used for the first time - more than 30 metric tonnes - 300,000 rounds in all.</p> <p>It is a landscape still dotted with the ruins of Iraqi tanks blasted with the ammunition, the rents in their armour still emitting tell-tale signs of low-level radiation.</p> <p>Significantly this battlefield represents an unintentional experiment - a decade in the making - over what happens to depleted uranium debris in the environment and how it affects the health of local populations. The most serious of those effects, the Iraqi authorities have long claimed, has been a sharp rise in childhood leukaemias and birth defects.</p> <p>And it was to here that British low-level radiation specialist Dr Chris Busby travelled three months ago to perform a radiological survey for an Arab television station. What Busby discovered surprised him. Soil samples - confiscated by the Iraqi authorities - showed lower levels of contamination than he expected.</p> <p>But his air samples revealed levels of ionising radiation in the atmosphere around the battlefield 10 times higher than in the neighbouring city of Basra and 20 times higher than in Baghdad.</p> <p>If his samples are correct, then US and British military claims that microscopic breathable particles of depleted uranium quickly disperse might not be true. It is this that is at the centre of the present controversy.</p> <p>What is accepted by all sides is that when depleted uranium ammunition - used in bullets for its hardness and penetrating power - hits its target, it also explodes and burns at temperatures of up to 10,000 C forming a smoke or 'aerosol' of suspended particles composed of three toxic and radioactive compounds of uranium.</p> <p>But, according to US and British defence experts, the only risk is to those in the vicinity of the battlefield in the immediate aftermath of the attack who breathe in concentrations of the aerosol of compounds.</p> <p>The risk, they claim decreases, as the aerosol disperses to levels of risk below that acceptable within the civil nuclear industry. According to these calculations there should be no contamination of Iraq's air and little risk.</p> <p>Busby, however, believes that the MoD's experts have got it wrong on two counts: on the way that charged, contaminated particles remain in the environment and - more seriously - over their risk models which he claims are outdated and underestimate the health impact by up to 1,000-fold, a claim he made in a paper to the Royal Society's Depleted Uranium working group last year.</p> <p>Busby is not alone in believing the MoD may have got it wrong. Professor Malcolm Hooper, a member of the British Legion's Gulf War Illnesses Inter-Parliamentary group, also believes the advice given by health experts of the British and US military is dangerously out of date.</p> <p>'New research suggests the risk threshold from inhaled particles is much, much lower than previously assumed,' he said.</p> <p>Hooper points to research suggesting that genetic mutation to irradiated cell tissue takes place in a more pernicious way than previously assumed, with 35 per cent of cells neighbouring a single irradiated one showing evidence of damage.</p> <p>The most controversial piece of research, however, has been undertaken in Newfoundland, Canada, where scientists at the International Uranium Centre tested the urine of British, US and Canadian Gulf war veterans, as well as that of Iraqi veterans and civilians, using for the first time Thermal Ionising Mass Spectrometry. They detected traces of depleted uranium in their urine.</p> <p>The Ministry of Defence is sceptical about the work of both Busby and the International Uranium Centre, led by Professor Asaf Durakovic and Dr Patricia Horan, pointing instead to a US study by the Baltimore Veteran Affairs department of 33 American veterans who survived so-called 'friendly fire' incidents involving depleted uranium ammunition. 'These people have considerable amounts of depleted uranium in their bodies in the form of shrapnel, and excrete high levels of uranium in their urine,' said an MoD source. 'Significantly none of them of has shown significant problems, nor have their children.'</p> <p>Frank Cop and the other victims are not going to be convinced.</p> <p>\u0095 Additional reporting by Emma Daly in Madrid and Eduardo Goncalves in Lisbon</p>",

And it was to here that British low-level radiation specialist Dr Chris Busby travelled three months ago to perform a radiological survey for an Arab television station. What Busby discovered surprised him. Soil samples - confiscated by the Iraqi authorities - showed lower levels of contamination than he expected. But his air samples revealed levels of ionising radiation in the atmosphere around the battlefield 10 times higher than in the neighbouring city of Basra and 20 times higher than in Baghdad. If his samples are correct, then US and British military claims that microscopic breathable particles of depleted uranium quickly disperse might not be true. It is this that is at the centre of the present controversy. What is accepted by all sides is that when depleted uranium ammunition - used in bullets for its hardness and penetrating power - hits its target, it also explodes and burns at temperatures of up to 10,000 C forming a smoke or 'aerosol' of suspended particles composed of three toxic and radioactive compounds of uranium. But, according to US and British defence experts, the only risk is to those in the vicinity of the battlefield in the immediate aftermath of the attack who breathe in concentrations of the aerosol of compounds. The risk, they claim decreases, as the aerosol disperses to levels of risk below that acceptable within the civil nuclear industry. According to these calculations there should be no contamination of Iraq's air and little risk. Busby, however, believes that the MoD's experts have got it wrong on two counts: on the way that charged, contaminated particles remain in the environment and - more seriously - over their risk models which he claims are outdated and underestimate the health impact by up to 1,000-fold, a claim he made in a paper to the Royal Society's Depleted Uranium working group last year. Busby is not alone in believing the MoD may have got it wrong. Professor Malcolm Hooper, a member of the British Legion's Gulf War Illnesses Inter-Parliamentary group, also believes the advice given by health experts of the British and US military is dangerously out of date. 'New research suggests the risk threshold from inhaled particles is much, much lower than previously assumed,' he said. Hooper points to research suggesting that genetic mutation to irradiated cell tissue takes place in a more pernicious way than previously assumed, with 35 per cent of cells neighbouring a single irradiated one showing evidence of damage. The most controversial piece of research, however, has been undertaken in Newfoundland, Canada, where scientists at the International Uranium Centre tested the urine of British, US and Canadian Gulf war veterans, as well as that of Iraqi veterans and civilians, using for the first time Thermal Ionising Mass Spectrometry. They detected traces of depleted uranium in their urine. The Ministry of Defence is sceptical about the work of both Busby and the International Uranium Centre, led by Professor Asaf Durakovic and Dr Patricia Horan, pointing instead to a US study by the Baltimore Veteran Affairs department of 33 American veterans who survived so-called 'friendly fire' incidents involving depleted uranium ammunition. 'These people have considerable amounts of depleted uranium in their bodies in the form of shrapnel, and excrete high levels of uranium in their urine,' said an MoD source. 'Significantly none of them of has shown significant problems, nor have their children.' Frank Cop and the other victims are not going to be convinced. \u0095 Additional reporting by Emma Daly in Madrid and Eduardo Goncalves in Lisbon",

      "body": "<p> <strong>1 Rudi Voller</strong><br> Peter Shilton paid for his in champagne, Terry McDermott, Phil Thompson, Graeme Souness, Kevin Keegan and Craig Johnston greased theirs daily, but Rudi Voller was and remains queen of the perm. Peroxide with grey highlights, Voller's cut made him a German style icon and elevated him to the top of this competitive style category - landing him OSM's overall worst cut prize. </p> <p> The style's greatest moment came when, during the 1990 World Cup, it collected and held, glue-like, the spit of Frank Rijkaard, leading to the Dutchman's famous red card. Voller remains one of the most popular men in Germany. He narrowly beats retired Austrian striker Toni Polster to the title - Polster wore his monster-perm with white socks and gold jewellery. He now has his own fashion label. </p> <p> <strong>Nicky Clarke's verdict:</strong><br> Oh god, oh god. This is just so... He's managed to combine Steve Coogan's Paul Calf with Harry Enfield's Scousers, and be German at the same time. Oh god, no, absolutely awful. </p> <p><strong>Cost of the style in Clarke's London salon:</strong> No way. I'd do all the others if pressed, but if I was asked for this in all seriousness I'd refuse. No way.</p> <p><strong>2 Alexi Lalas</strong><br> If you're going to be a ginger Detroit rocker-cum-footballer, you might as well look like it - which is why Lalas only makes second in the list. It's a shocking set of facial hair devices - but whatever you think about him, Lalas is totally true to himself: bad haircut, bad musician, bad footballer. He does, though, take some credit for spending two years in Italy with Padova (after aborting a move to Coventry) without toning it down. He built a reputation in Serie A as a foul-mouthed New Age traveller, but enjoyed it. 'It was great, man, playing in Italy,' he explains. He gave up football in 1998 after meeting Pele ('Fuck, I mean, he's the man, all that sort of stuff just blows me away') to work with his band full time. His first major album, Ginger, was released in November that year. 'We just blew it out in two weeks in the studio,' he said. 'Man, it rocks.' </p> <p><strong>The Clarke verdict:</strong> I do know of this guy - I've never cut for him - but I quite like this. He breaks the rules - the top looks like he should be in an early Nineties Seattle grunge band, the bottom looks hard rock. He looks mad, I love it.</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> With a deft hand for the facial work, \u00a3150.</p> <p> <strong>3 David Seaman</strong><br> Seaman has needed a haircut from a proper, sensible \u00a38-a-go barber for the past 19 years. Instead, the England keeper uses the likes of Belgravia's Errol Douglas - a celebrity stylist - and turns up at Highbury week in week out looking like a drug-weakened advertising executive in shorts. This season's adventure made the problem worse. In 1998, he was named most stylish sports star at the Elle Style Awards. Two years on he's just a 37-year-old with a ponytail. On leather-loving Emmanuel Petit, Roberto Baggio and even snooker's Peter Ebdon, it didn't look so bad. On Seaman, say the Helsinki press, it's a Soho porn merchant's dream.</p> <p><strong>The Clarke verdict:</strong> Ah, the infamous David Seaman. I'd like to think that no professional stylist would do this for him. It's kitsch, but surely not deliberately so.</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Large tub of gel, clip and a band. \u00a375. But, honestly, not one I'd want to see walking out of my salon.</p> <p><strong> 4 Jason Lee </strong><br> 22 May 1996: the ultimate bad hair day. After a month of Fantasy Football's Frank Skinner and David Baddiel linking Lee's pineapple hair-do to his poor performances (Lee was depicted in then-Forest-manager Frank Clark's office failing to hit a tea cup with a sugar cube from six inches) the striker was transfer-listed, and a promising career left in ruins. Richard &amp; Judy invited him onto This Morning for a phone-in, Nottingham nightclubs put on themed pineapple nights, the press hounded his family and, by June, the BBC were receiving more than 200 letters a week with pictures of pineapples in different settings. Lee, who had been Forest's top scorer, suffered badly. 'It was unbelievable,' he said. 'It went on and on and my family were hammered.' He left on loan, before permanent moves to Watford then Chesterfield. Now, with a freshly shaved head, he's rebuilding his career at Peterborough. <strong>The Clarke verdict:</strong> Well, it's not one of my favourites, but with afro hair, it is great to make the most of its ability to be sculpted. But not great for football, surely?</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> From scratch, \u00a3400.</p> <p><strong>5 George Berry</strong><br> The worst/best afro of all time - big, square and in your face. Today George Berry is a bald PFA executive, but in the Seventies he was a bad haircut god, a Welsh international and considered by the rugby-playing Welsh wing of his Jamaican-Welsh family 'a big poof'. 'People think I had a square Afro because it was so big it never fitted into photo frames and the papers and magazines had to crop it that way. But there were plenty of big hairstyles around then - Remi Moses, Brendon Batson - but mine was the biggest and best.' Berry won a 1980 League Cup medal with Wolves, then moved on to Stoke, Aldershot and Stafford Rangers. Other exponents include the absurd Carlos Valderama - who ignored searing temperatures throughout his career to maintain his look - Alan Sunderland and the pre-bald Gianluca Vialli.</p> <p><strong>The Clarke verdict:</strong> I love the straight lines he's achieved. This was a popular look at the time, and apart from the practical problems, there's no arguing with it.</p> <p><strong> Cost:</strong> It would take an hour - \u00a380 </p> <p><strong>6 Peter Beardsley</strong><br> There's something heroic about Peter Beardsley's hair. Any boy sporting this cut to school would be broken in minutes - but Beardsley has stood by it for over 22 years. Last year he was tipped as a great lover by the Sunday Mirror, who claimed 'research shows that women find it hard to resist the charms of ugly men like Peter Beardsley. They try harder to make their partner happy.' Beardsley though was also once named 'the only person who, when he appears on television, makes daleks hide behind the sofa'. </p> <p><strong>The Clarke verdict:</strong> Christ, he looks like a thin Ann Widdecombe. It is slightly worrying that a man should have this pre-teen Purdie arrangement. </p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> He's actually got great hair. I'd thin the sides and contemporise the fringe. He could be cool. \u00a350 </p> <p><strong>7 Ralph Coates</strong><br> A haircut so good they made a song about it. 'Grease Your Ralph', released in 1987 by Welsh band the Abs (and still available from specialist shops) was a tribute to Coates's combover - the only football combover widely considered better than Bobby Charlton's. When Coates tore down Burnley's wing, his hair travelled a second or two behind him - Charlton rarely held his with the same panache. Nobby Stiles was similarly inclined - and Bobby Mikhailov, ex-Reading and Bulgaria, once named 'cutest goalkeeper' by Bulgarian fans, wore a wig during games. Now, of course, a good bald haircut, modelled on David Beckham, will set you back \u00a3300.</p> <p><strong>The Clarke verdict: </strong> This sort of thing should never have happened. Maybe in '65 it wasn't as good to be bald as it is now, but this is absurd. However much grease or lacquer you put on, it'll not stick to the scalp - it'll just matt it all together. </p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> We'd take this shorter, to a refined No 3. \u00a370 </p> <p><strong>8 Alan Biley</strong><br> Mullet king Alan Biley comes in eighth for being a leader of this defining trend: Paul Walsh, Ron and Paul Futcher, Gerry Francis, Barry Venison, Colin Hendry, Chris Waddle, king of camp Mark Lawrenson, Bulgarian werewolf Trifon Ivanov and the whole of Eastern Europe - for whom it became the cut of choice throughout the Nineties - owe him a great debt. Today, Biley, a Seventies peroxide mullet legend for Cambridge, Derby, Everton and Portsmouth, manages Ryman League strugglers Barton Rovers after spells as a nanny, a landscape gardner and a council worker. But a mullet isn't always a bad thing. In 1996, after Spain's top sex symbol Julen 'El Guapo' (gorgeous) Guerrero was forced to cut his mullet by Athletic Bilbao's owner, female fans besieged the San Mames stadium for two days in protest. Top mullet fact: the word mullet comes from the nineteenth-century term 'mullethead', meaning 'moron' or 'fool'. Today the style is worn by those who consider themselves ironic.</p> <p><strong>The Clarke verdict:</strong> This chap's managed to do a mullet version of Joe Brown. The mullet's a Midwest American favourite - it's so ugly, and always has been. </p> <p> <strong>Cost:</strong> If I really, really, had to leave the back long, \u00a370</p> <p> <strong>9 Claudio Caniggia</strong><br> Caniggia wins credit for maintaining this cut, not only for 15 years, but to the detriment of his career. Told by Argentina coach Daniel Passarella in 1995 to have his 'girls hair' shortened or be thrown out of the squad, Caniggia - suspended for 13 months for cocaine use two years previously - chose the latter, and disappeared for six months. In 1998 his glam wife Marianna Nannis accused Diego Maradona of leading him astray: 'At times I believe Diego is in love with my husband,' she said. 'It must be the long hair and big muscles.' The Caniggias now live in Dundee following his unlikely move to Dens Park. In October 7,000 blond-wig wearing Scots watched him score a home debut screamer. Caniggia beats Derby's Taribo West, once master of Floella Benjamin bead chic, but now just a thinning Jason Lee wanabee.</p> <p><strong>The Clarke verdict:</strong> This again, I'm afraid, doesn't work at all. If he insists on keeping it long, he needs proper extensions to give it volume. It just doesn't work. He's a good looking guy and should do himself a few favours. </p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> I'd rather not, but if someone insisted on having this look, with the necessary extensions, \u00a3300</p> <p> <strong> 10 Socrates</strong><br> A fantastic player best known for chain-smoking at half-time, Brazilian legend Socrates was probably the hairiest man ever to feature in top level football (apart from Richard Keys). A star of the 1982 and 1986 World Cup finals, Socrates, also a qualified doctor, was an outspoken political dissident with grooming to match. His sense of style earns him 10th spot - Everton troll Abel Xavier, Gazza's hair extensions and the wild man of hair Terry Hurlock all just miss out.</p> <p><strong>The Clarke verdict: </strong> Oh, I like Socrates, big and butch - and he does look like a Socrates too, doesn't he? If you put this on an Englishman it would look daft, but it works here because of his deep set eyes. </p> <p> <strong>Cost:</strong> A delicate cut, plus blow dry, \u00a375.</p> <p> <strong>Justifying his selection</strong><br></p> <p> This month's 10 were selected by Observer football writer David Hills. Here he explains his choices:</p> <p>It's not trivial: footballing perms and mullets should never have hit Europe as hard as they did. But it happened, they caught on and bad taste defined at least three generations of professional athletes and their fans. </p> <p> There is, of course, a reason - hairdos for footballers, dressed in uniform strips, are the only way of expressing personality through image - hence, presumably, David Beckham's close crop. And it's always been this way. During a match in the Fifties, Bobby Johnstone, a flying winger for Hibs and Man City, pulled a comb out of his pocket, put his foot on the ball and took five minutes to comb his slicked-back quiff into place. </p> <p> Nicky Clarke, when we met at his London salon to talk hair, was disgusted by what he saw. 'This is awful. On the whole, I guess footballers have always tended to wear contemporary styles but with a two-year time delay. These mullets and perms were all on the streets, but footballers persisted long after the fashions had changed. </p> <p> 'These days, perhaps, players are getting more wary of extravagance. We have footballers in here - and golfers, boxers, racing drivers - they're all much more understated than they would have been 10 years ago. Take Beckham. I happen to think Beckham has great taste, but people with great taste don't get it right all the time. His old look was good, but this new, neutral shave does absolutely zero for him. He's still good looking, but it's such a shame he didn't stop at some of the stages in between fop and bald - I do wonder if the guy who did it tried various new styles, none of which worked, until he had nothing left to play with. He just looks like a thug now, but, I suppose, better that than a mullet.'</p> <p>As for the top 10 choices: there were plenty of near misses, of course, but this is a representative set. And why so few perms? 'They're too freakish,' says Nicky. 'Voller's says it all. I haven't given anyone - man or woman - a perm since the Seventies, and even then under great duress.'</p> <p> <strong>Now you have your say</strong><br></p> <p> Enraged by our choice?

      "bodyText": "1 Rudi Voller Peter Shilton paid for his in champagne, Terry McDermott, Phil Thompson, Graeme Souness, Kevin Keegan and Craig Johnston greased theirs daily, but Rudi Voller was and remains queen of the perm. Peroxide with grey highlights, Voller's cut made him a German style icon and elevated him to the top of this competitive style category - landing him OSM's overall worst cut prize. The style's greatest moment came when, during the 1990 World Cup, it collected and held, glue-like, the spit of Frank Rijkaard, leading to the Dutchman's famous red card. Voller remains one of the most popular men in Germany. He narrowly beats retired Austrian striker Toni Polster to the title - Polster wore his monster-perm with white socks and gold jewellery. He now has his own fashion label. Nicky Clarke's verdict: Oh god, oh god. This is just so... He's managed to combine Steve Coogan's Paul Calf with Harry Enfield's Scousers, and be German at the same time. Oh god, no, absolutely awful. Cost of the style in Clarke's London salon: No way. I'd do all the others if pressed, but if I was asked for this in all seriousness I'd refuse. No way. 2 Alexi Lalas If you're going to be a ginger Detroit rocker-cum-footballer, you might as well look like it - which is why Lalas only makes second in the list. It's a shocking set of facial hair devices - but whatever you think about him, Lalas is totally true to himself: bad haircut, bad musician, bad footballer. He does, though, take some credit for spending two years in Italy with Padova (after aborting a move to Coventry) without toning it down. He built a reputation in Serie A as a foul-mouthed New Age traveller, but enjoyed it. 'It was great, man, playing in Italy,' he explains. He gave up football in 1998 after meeting Pele ('Fuck, I mean, he's the man, all that sort of stuff just blows me away') to work with his band full time. His first major album, Ginger, was released in November that year. 'We just blew it out in two weeks in the studio,' he said. 'Man, it rocks.' The Clarke verdict: I do know of this guy - I've never cut for him - but I quite like this. He breaks the rules - the top looks like he should be in an early Nineties Seattle grunge band, the bottom looks hard rock. He looks mad, I love it. Cost: With a deft hand for the facial work, \u00a3150. 3 David Seaman Seaman has needed a haircut from a proper, sensible \u00a38-a-go barber for the past 19 years. Instead, the England keeper uses the likes of Belgravia's Errol Douglas - a celebrity stylist - and turns up at Highbury week in week out looking like a drug-weakened advertising executive in shorts. This season's adventure made the problem worse. In 1998, he was named most stylish sports star at the Elle Style Awards. Two years on he's just a 37-year-old with a ponytail. On leather-loving Emmanuel Petit, Roberto Baggio and even snooker's Peter Ebdon, it didn't look so bad. On Seaman, say the Helsinki press, it's a Soho porn merchant's dream. The Clarke verdict: Ah, the infamous David Seaman. I'd like to think that no professional stylist would do this for him. It's kitsch, but surely not deliberately so. Cost: Large tub of gel, clip and a band. \u00a375. But, honestly, not one I'd want to see walking out of my salon. 4 Jason Lee 22 May 1996: the ultimate bad hair day. After a month of Fantasy Football's Frank Skinner and David Baddiel linking Lee's pineapple hair-do to his poor performances (Lee was depicted in then-Forest-manager Frank Clark's office failing to hit a tea cup with a sugar cube from six inches) the striker was transfer-listed, and a promising career left in ruins. Richard &amp; Judy invited him onto This Morning for a phone-in, Nottingham nightclubs put on themed pineapple nights, the press hounded his family and, by June, the BBC were receiving more than 200 letters a week with pictures of pineapples in different settings. Lee, who had been Forest's top scorer, suffered badly. 'It was unbelievable,' he said. 'It went on and on and my family were hammered.' He left on loan, before permanent moves to Watford then Chesterfield. Now, with a freshly shaved head, he's rebuilding his career at Peterborough. The Clarke verdict: Well, it's not one of my favourites, but with afro hair, it is great to make the most of its ability to be sculpted. But not great for football, surely? Cost: From scratch, \u00a3400. 5 George Berry The worst/best afro of all time - big, square and in your face. Today George Berry is a bald PFA executive, but in the Seventies he was a bad haircut god, a Welsh international and considered by the rugby-playing Welsh wing of his Jamaican-Welsh family 'a big poof'. 'People think I had a square Afro because it was so big it never fitted into photo frames and the papers and magazines had to crop it that way. But there were plenty of big hairstyles around then - Remi Moses, Brendon Batson - but mine was the biggest and best.' Berry won a 1980 League Cup medal with Wolves, then moved on to Stoke, Aldershot and Stafford Rangers. Other exponents include the absurd Carlos Valderama - who ignored searing temperatures throughout his career to maintain his look - Alan Sunderland and the pre-bald Gianluca Vialli. The Clarke verdict: I love the straight lines he's achieved. This was a popular look at the time, and apart from the practical problems, there's no arguing with it. Cost: It would take an hour - \u00a380 6 Peter Beardsley There's something heroic about Peter Beardsley's hair. Any boy sporting this cut to school would be broken in minutes - but Beardsley has stood by it for over 22 years. Last year he was tipped as a great lover by the Sunday Mirror, who claimed 'research shows that women find it hard to resist the charms of ugly men like Peter Beardsley. They try harder to make their partner happy.' Beardsley though was also once named 'the only person who, when he appears on television, makes daleks hide behind the sofa'. The Clarke verdict: Christ, he looks like a thin Ann Widdecombe. It is slightly worrying that a man should have this pre-teen Purdie arrangement. Cost: He's actually got great hair. I'd thin the sides and contemporise the fringe. He could be cool. \u00a350 7 Ralph Coates A haircut so good they made a song about it. 'Grease Your Ralph', released in 1987 by Welsh band the Abs (and still available from specialist shops) was a tribute to Coates's combover - the only football combover widely considered better than Bobby Charlton's. When Coates tore down Burnley's wing, his hair travelled a second or two behind him - Charlton rarely held his with the same panache. Nobby Stiles was similarly inclined - and Bobby Mikhailov, ex-Reading and Bulgaria, once named 'cutest goalkeeper' by Bulgarian fans, wore a wig during games.

Maybe in '65 it wasn't as good to be bald as it is now, but this is absurd. However much grease or lacquer you put on, it'll not stick to the scalp - it'll just matt it all together. Cost: We'd take this shorter, to a refined No 3. \u00a370 8 Alan Biley Mullet king Alan Biley comes in eighth for being a leader of this defining trend: Paul Walsh, Ron and Paul Futcher, Gerry Francis, Barry Venison, Colin Hendry, Chris Waddle, king of camp Mark Lawrenson, Bulgarian werewolf Trifon Ivanov and the whole of Eastern Europe - for whom it became the cut of choice throughout the Nineties - owe him a great debt.

      "body": "<p>\u0095 In early November we interviewed Stefan Schnoor. At the time the 29-year-old German defender was with Derby County. He joined the club in 1998, and when we asked him how long he would be staying in English football he said: 'I don't know. My contract is up at the end of the season, but I would be happy to stay.' In fact he had only a few more days left. On 13 November Derby swapped him for Wolfsburg's Scottish international defender Brian O'Neil. From his answers it seems unlikely that the move was his idea. At the time of going to press he had yet to play for Wolfsburg.</p> <p> <strong> Age: 29</strong><br> <strong>Birthplace:</strong> Neumunster <br><strong>Position:</strong> Defender <br> Joined Derby on a free transfer under Bosman ruling in 1998 <br><strong> Appearances:</strong> 55 (14)<br></p> <p> <strong>Did you get to see English football as a child, and did you support anyone?</strong><br> When I was very young, not too much. It was only when there was a special game on a Sunday afternoon. As I got older, with digital TV I got to see more and more, especially European games. I always looked out for Liverpool's results, and always admired Kevin Keegan because he used to play for Hamburg. </p> <p> <strong>First played professional football for? </strong><br> SV Hamburg, Germany. </p> <p> <strong>How did your move to England come about? </strong><br> I was on a Bosman, I had played for seven or eight years at Hamburg and it was the right time to make a change. For me, I was always likely to come to England, I liked the football, so when I got the chance to join Derby I said yes straight away. </p> <p> <strong> Had you heard of them before you joined? </strong><br> Yes. </p> <p><strong>What were your first impressions of English football? </strong><br> It's a very high-tempo game - more physical, the atmosphere in the stadiums is very noisy. I like the character and mentality of the English players. They are all honest and there is no cheating. As a foreigner that was a big surprise. There are a lot of hard tackles but you know when someone is on the floor he really is injured. It is different with the foreigners. It was something that, when I first came over, I had to get used to. I read the papers and see other foreign players moaning about playing too many matches and that the tackles are too hard. I think when you go abroad you can't do that - you have to accept the game and their style and be quiet. You shouldn't say things like Frank Lebeouf does. Who does he think he is? If he thinks France is the best, he should fuck off and go back. </p> <p><strong> Where are you living now? </strong><br> I stayed in a hotel for the first six weeks, until my house was ready for me to move into.</p> <p> <strong> Have you got any family over with you? </strong><br> I am married to my wife Nicole and we have an 18-month-old daughter. The rest of my family is back in Germany. I go home a couple of times a year. This summer I went back for six weeks. My wife goes back more than I do because we're having a house built, which she checks up on. A lot of the time my family and friends come over to visit me and see a game or whatever.</p> <p> <strong> How does the training differ to what you are used to? </strong><br> There are so many games in this country, that there is a lot less training than in Germany. In Germany if you are bottom of the league you would be out training twice every day, we have the mentality that if things are not going well you have to work and try twice as hard to put things right again. Here the coaches try to relax you as much as possible to get you in the right frame of mind to concentrate on the next match.</p> <p> <strong> What do you do in the afternoons and evenings? </strong><br> I watch a lot of sport, play golf. I've tried watching cricket but I don't really understand it and it doesn't really interest me. There are loads of things to do, I read the newspapers, play with my baby, or go shopping in Manchester or London. Derby is quite central so it is easy to go places. Or go out for meals, you have every type or restaurant here. </p> <p> <strong> Have you learned to speak English?</strong><br> I learned it at school. It is the first foreign language you are taught in Germany. Then through holidays and films you learn more and more. So it wasn't a big problem for me. I settled in very quickly, I spoke quite good English before I came here so I was able to understand everything I was being told - apart from the Scottish boys!</p> <p><strong>What do you like and dislike about living in England?</strong><br> Life is more quiet and relaxed in England. On the roads people here are patient. In Germany everyone is angry, shouting or beeping their horns at each other all the time. Also people in England are much better at queuing for things, like taxis or buses. You don't get that in Germany - there it's just whoever pushes their way to the front. Things in England are much more expensive - cars, clothes, food. I don't miss Germany at the moment though because I know I'm going to be here for a certain number of years working, then I'll go back home. So I'm enjoying it.</p> <p><strong> Is the atmosphere in the dressing room different to other countries? </strong><br> No, I think it largely the same throughout the world. When you lose obviously everyone is disappointed. There is a certain amount of good-natured rivalry about the German national team. When we are doing badly, like during the Euro championships, I got a bit of stick but I can always do the same about the England team, it's all just a bit of fun really. </p> <p> B&gt; How do English fans compare to those in other countries you have played in? <br> Here the fans are more supportive of their team, they put their hearts into it. The things I read about the big teams with the star players were all true. There is a special atmosphere in English stadiums, completely different to Germany where you slaughtered by the fans when you go on to the pitch, especially if you are doing badly. </p> <p><strong> Have you ever experienced racism by opponents or opposing fans?</strong><br> No. </p> <p> <strong> How long do you think you will stay in English football? </strong><br> I don't know. My contract is up at the end of the season, but I would be happy to stay.</p>",

I like the character and mentality of the English players. They are all honest and there is no cheating. As a foreigner that was a big surprise. There are a lot of hard tackles but you know when someone is on the floor he really is injured. It is different with the foreigners. It was something that, when I first came over, I had to get used to. I read the papers and see other foreign players moaning about playing too many matches and that the tackles are too hard. I think when you go abroad you can't do that - you have to accept the game and their style and be quiet. You shouldn't say things like Frank Lebeouf does. Who does he think he is? If he thinks France is the best, he should fuck off and go back. Where are you living now? I stayed in a hotel for the first six weeks, until my house was ready for me to move into. Have you got any family over with you? I am married to my wife Nicole and we have an 18-month-old daughter. The rest of my family is back in Germany. I go home a couple of times a year. This summer I went back for six weeks. My wife goes back more than I do because we're having a house built, which she checks up on. A lot of the time my family and friends come over to visit me and see a game or whatever. How does the training differ to what you are used to? There are so many games in this country, that there is a lot less training than in Germany. In Germany if you are bottom of the league you would be out training twice every day, we have the mentality that if things are not going well you have to work and try twice as hard to put things right again. Here the coaches try to relax you as much as possible to get you in the right frame of mind to concentrate on the next match. What do you do in the afternoons and evenings? I watch a lot of sport, play golf. I've tried watching cricket but I don't really understand it and it doesn't really interest me. There are loads of things to do, I read the newspapers, play with my baby, or go shopping in Manchester or London. Derby is quite central so it is easy to go places. Or go out for meals, you have every type or restaurant here. Have you learned to speak English? I learned it at school. It is the first foreign language you are taught in Germany. Then through holidays and films you learn more and more. So it wasn't a big problem for me. I settled in very quickly, I spoke quite good English before I came here so I was able to understand everything I was being told - apart from the Scottish boys! What do you like and dislike about living in England? Life is more quiet and relaxed in England. On the roads people here are patient. In Germany everyone is angry, shouting or beeping their horns at each other all the time. Also people in England are much better at queuing for things, like taxis or buses. You don't get that in Germany - there it's just whoever pushes their way to the front. Things in England are much more expensive - cars, clothes, food. I don't miss Germany at the moment though because I know I'm going to be here for a certain number of years working, then I'll go back home. So I'm enjoying it. Is the atmosphere in the dressing room different to other countries? No, I think it largely the same throughout the world. When you lose obviously everyone is disappointed. There is a certain amount of good-natured rivalry about the German national team. When we are doing badly, like during the Euro championships, I got a bit of stick but I can always do the same about the England team, it's all just a bit of fun really. B&gt; How do English fans compare to those in other countries you have played in? Here the fans are more supportive of their team, they put their hearts into it. The things I read about the big teams with the star players were all true. There is a special atmosphere in English stadiums, completely different to Germany where you slaughtered by the fans when you go on to the pitch, especially if you are doing badly. Have you ever experienced racism by opponents or opposing fans? No. How long do you think you will stay in English football? I don't know. My contract is up at the end of the season, but I would be happy to stay.",

      "body": "<p>Two young Britons, jailed for attempting to smuggle drugs out of Venezuela, have broken their parole and fled back to England after fearing they would be killed, The Observer can reveal.</p> <p>James Miles and Paul Loseby were detained at the airport in the capital, Caracas, in November 1996. They were found to be wearing waistcoats filled with packets of cocaine and claimed they had been forced to carry the drugs by a man who had threatened them with a gun.</p> <p>Speaking exclusively to The Observer from his family home in Leicester, Miles said: 'It's fantastic to be back. I am still coming to terms with it. So much has happened over the last four years, I've been through so much. The worst thing has been losing contact with all my friends and being away from my family. I feel like a stranger now. Everyone has moved on, apart from me.'</p> <p>Miles was just 18 and on his first trip abroad at the time of his arrest. He and Loseby were initially held in a police detention centre in Caracas where they had to share a single toilet with 70 other prisoners. They were then moved to the notorious Yare 1 prison an hour's drive from the city which, according to Amnesty International, has been the scene of appalling human rights abuses.</p> <p>'The conditions were like hell. At first we were scared because everyone had knives. So we had to get knives as well.'</p> <p>At one point he and Loseby were attacked by prison guards demanding a cash bribe. They refused to pay and were dragged at gunpoint from their beds before being stripped and beaten. Miles was left with severe bruising while Loseby required medical treatment for multiple lacerations. Conditions in the prison were also extremely unhygenic. Last year Loseby contracted tuberculosis, from which he is still recovering.</p> <p>Last May Miles and Loseby were released on parole. Miles said: 'Even though we had been released on parole, we still had to return to the prison every night. At weekends we would live on the streets the whole time because there was nowhere else to go.</p> <p>'We had to get out of the country otherwise we would have been killed. The prisons were bad enough but it was actually more dangerous on the streets. Everyone there was a pure thief. The people were all so poor they didn't have anything, apart from a gun. The police would come along and kill them for no reason.</p> <p>'We lost count of the number of times we got attacked or threatened. We knew people in the prison, we had friends there.

      "bodyText": "Two young Britons, jailed for attempting to smuggle drugs out of Venezuela, have broken their parole and fled back to England after fearing they would be killed, The Observer can reveal. James Miles and Paul Loseby were detained at the airport in the capital, Caracas, in November 1996. They were found to be wearing waistcoats filled with packets of cocaine and claimed they had been forced to carry the drugs by a man who had threatened them with a gun. Speaking exclusively to The Observer from his family home in Leicester, Miles said: 'It's fantastic to be back. I am still coming to terms with it. So much has happened over the last four years, I've been through so much. The worst thing has been losing contact with all my friends and being away from my family. I feel like a stranger now. Everyone has moved on, apart from me.' Miles was just 18 and on his first trip abroad at the time of his arrest. He and Loseby were initially held in a police detention centre in Caracas where they had to share a single toilet with 70 other prisoners. They were then moved to the notorious Yare 1 prison an hour's drive from the city which, according to Amnesty International, has been the scene of appalling human rights abuses. 'The conditions were like hell. At first we were scared because everyone had knives. So we had to get knives as well.' At one point he and Loseby were attacked by prison guards demanding a cash bribe. They refused to pay and were dragged at gunpoint from their beds before being stripped and beaten. Miles was left with severe bruising while Loseby required medical treatment for multiple lacerations. Conditions in the prison were also extremely unhygenic. Last year Loseby contracted tuberculosis, from which he is still recovering. Last May Miles and Loseby were released on parole. Miles said: 'Even though we had been released on parole, we still had to return to the prison every night. At weekends we would live on the streets the whole time because there was nowhere else to go. 'We had to get out of the country otherwise we would have been killed. The prisons were bad enough but it was actually more dangerous on the streets. Everyone there was a pure thief. The people were all so poor they didn't have anything, apart from a gun. The police would come along and kill them for no reason. 'We lost count of the number of times we got attacked or threatened. We knew people in the prison, we had friends there. Living on the streets, there was no one to help us but ourselves. There were shootings and killings all around us all the time.' The pair survived on money sent by their parents. They expected to get work but soon discovered that it was not possible because they did not have the necessary permits. 'Any money we earned would have gone straight to the government anyway so in the end we didn't bother.' Under the terms of their parole they were not allowed to leave Venezuela but after witnessing a vicious attack on street people last month, they decided to try to get back home. Miles's family was unwilling to discuss the exact method used to get the young men out of Venezuela but both are believed to have used money sent by their parents to bribe officials in order to board an outgoing flight. The pair arrived back in the UK shortly before Christmas but the news was kept quiet by their families. 'Jimmy's not had a proper Christmas with his family for five years. We didn't want anyone to know about it,' said his father Steven. James Miles now hopes to find work in the building trade and attempt to rebuild his life. Venezuela has informed the British Foreign Office that the men have failed to meet the terms of their parole but it has not asked Britain to take any action. There is no extradition agreement between the countries.",

But when I point that out he laughs and says that doesn't always mean you end up doing what you love for a living. </p> <p>Eight years ago, he was working in a JobCentre. He had no musical training but samplers had begun to make it possible to make records without playing instruments or having access to expensive studios, so he teamed up with two friends and made a dance track. His old school-mate, the Radio 1 DJ Judge Jules, said it was all wrong and didn't stand a chance of success. But the record was 'Don't You Want Me?' by Felix, and it went to number six in the singles charts in the summer of 1992. </p> <p>Now, Rollo says he has almost everything he wants. He gestures happily around his well-equipped recording studio near his home in Highbury, north London. Somehow, he's made a career out of producing dance music that goes against the grain. When he released Reverence, the first album by the pop/dance collective Faithless on his small independent label Cheeky in 1995, he saw it as a kind of sampler, a chance for him and his friends to showcase their varying talents. It encompassed everything from rap to techno, folk whimsy to a Tom Waits-like ballad. But the songs were unusually strong, Faithless toured endlessly to spread the word, and, although ignored at first, the album eventually sold millions, as did its equally eclectic follow-up, Sunday 8pm. </p> <p>Rollo isn't interested in being famous. He did the sound on the first Faithless tour but says going on stage would have been pointless, since he couldn't play anything. As soon as he could, he returned to the studio to continue making records, including part of an album by his sister Dido, who has just broken America and looks set to replicate that success here. </p> <p>He rarely agrees to be photographed, and this is a rare interview to promote Dusted, the project he has worked on with Mark Bates, a keyboard player who toured for a while with Faithless. </p> <p>Their first album, When We Were Young, is a lush, ambient electronic soundscape, a warm bath of a record in which the listener can simply float, oblivious, on a surface of mellow beats and beautiful songs, or choose to explore the darker depths which lie beneath.</p> <p>Although the term is now much-maligned, Rollo is happy to call it a concept album: 'There was a definite idea behind it. It's written as a sequence.'</p> <p>The record is about childhood, about its joys but also its pain and frustrations. Some of the memories it documents seem to be troubled, but it's also about looking back as an adult - he is 33 now - making peace with those memories, finding forgiveness and understanding and the hope that we can do better with our own children that our parents did with us.</p> <p>The album has been out since last summer but only now has Rollo agreed to release a single from it, 'Always Remember to Respect and Honour Your Mother', featuring angelic choirboy vocals and an animated video full of ambiguous demons. </p> <p>When pressed to talk about his own childhood, Rollo finds it hard to go into too much detail. He has no wish to hurt anyone. His mother is a poet who he describes as 'quite eccentric'; his father is a publisher who would read him history instead of bedtime stories. They lived in a house full of books, but with no television or any awareness of what it meant to call your kids Rollo and Dido, then send them to a tough north London comprehensive with, in Rollo's case, trousers that were far too short and hair that was far too long. Luckily, he observes dryly, he was good at football. </p> <p>His mother had a difficult childhood and later battled with depression. 'She was a highly intelligent woman who gave up her career to bring up kids. And though full of love, up to a point she held that against us and the world in general. We had some great times when she was happy, had lots of lovely moments, but when she was sad it could be quite a heavy experience.'</p> <p>Rollo's own attitude to life seems relentlessly upbeat. After long negotiations, he recently sold Cheeky to the major label BMG. The success of Faithless enabled him to sign a roster of talented friends, but when their records were finished he was suddenly faced with the responsibility of marketing them, of organising what had become quite a large company. Realising he couldn't cope, he found a major label that could. 'Which was an enormous relief not just to me, but to all the artists.'</p> <p>So now he can stay in his studio undisturbed, give or take the odd nightclub or football game. This year there will be a new Faithless album and debut albums by Cheeky artists such as Skinny and Rob D. He will also be working on a new Dusted album with Mark Bates and is thinking seriously about reworking his favourite musical, My Fair Lady. 'I think I'm a genuinely happy person,' he smiles.

Waves of impossible fury climb over one other from all sides, spume flies so fast that a thick salt lace covers all: the entire sea, it seems, is trying to stand up and walk towards us. There is a terrible keening sound. Night is falling, fast, and the seas are still growing. The video ends, suddenly - and that is the last we see, possibly the last anyone will ever see, of Team Philips, the \u00a34 million giant catamaran of luminous grace and speed which has swallowed the past five years of Pete Goss's life and which, for 10 long hours that night, prevented the worst that the bitter North Atlantic could throw at sailors from similarly swallowing Goss and his six crewmen.</p> <p>'I had to stop the cameras about then,' says Goss, for whom the words 'practical' and 'understated' are simply inadequate, 'because I knew we might need the power for communications.' They did, sending out a Mayday - the first in Goss's 39 years, as Marine, yachtsman and adventurer - which led the next day to their touch-and-go rescue by a German container ship, and the sad abandonment of Team Philips to the Fates.</p> <p>Goss later gave a press conference, in which he was reported as close to tears. 'Quite right, yes, I'll never be embarrassed about having emotions. It was heart-rending.'</p> <p>This is the first time he has spoken face to face about that night. Meeting him this week has an added poignancy, in that the 'Race' has just begun - the French round-the-world free-for-all, devoid of classes or rules other than being first home and staying alive, which Goss and his team had spent all these years preparing for, and to whose starting line, at the stroke of the New Year, only six yachts made it.</p> <p>'No, of course I'm not bitter,' he says, with a soft smile. 'I say bravo to them. The Race was always a double challenge - the first to make the start line, the second to make the finish, and we didn't make the first.'</p> <p>There is no defensiveness - for, he says, he knows the boat worked. 'The concept worked brilliantly. She was a magnificent sail. I'm determined to show the videos, and tell people that it worked. If I was ever to enter another Race, it would be with the same boat and the same crew. It was just the seas, those impossible, very unusual seas. But she was magnificent, and she saved us...had we been in a 'normal' boat, I'm sure, we would not be alive today.'</p> <p>Goss is no stranger to high and angry seas. Four years ago he turned around in the Southern Ocean during the Vendee Globe single-handed race after a Mayday, and sailed into the teeth of blattering seas for two solid days to rescue Frenchman Raphael Dinelli. Dinelli was an estimated 10 hours from death when Goss reached him. The first layer of his eyes, Goss tells me with a faint raising of the eyebrows, had been pebble-dashed off. 'But if you have a strong enough will to live then the body does start to feed off itself.' The pair are now best friends.</p> <p>Goss had never before seen the combination of waves thrown up during his final sea-trials by December's Atlantic. 'There was a big depression off Newfoundland but I knew I'd be fine, could run back to the UK easily. But then, really unusually, the front in the depression created a new depression. You read about these phenomena, but you never really expect them.</p> <p>'The pressure dropped 18 millibars in three hours, which was very, very frightening, it put the hair up on the back of your neck. This thing was generating right above us. We had this triangle of waves, all meeting, and generating rogue waves. Something would catch your eye and you'd think it was a cloud, and then suddenly realise it was a wave, twice the height of anything, travelling at a huge speed in a random direction, with a huge breaking face...it would come up and go off like a steam engine.'</p> <p>Goss battened down his crew in survival suits, took the helm and got them through the night, steering desperately to avoid broaching; even with all sails down, trailing drogues and sea-anchors and every spare line out of the stern, they were still doing 32 knots. But she had taken such a battering that he feared the steering would be damaged by another storm, and a further hurricane was coming to meet them at 40 knots. He made what he admits was the hardest decision of his life and sent the Mayday.</p> <p>He must have thought, often, that he was going over. 'Yeah. The rudders were coming 15 feet out of the water. You'd go into a wave and think, this is it, we've bloody had it. But she would drag us out of it. And she never really, with hindsight, took me somewhere I didn't want to go. So the concept was safe.</p> <p>'I'm not a risk taker for the sake of it. I've got a family, and I want to come home. The reason I do it is because I love it. There are times I've been really frightened, but there is this thing that knowledge dispels fear, and so you minimise risk wherever you can.'</p> <p>Did he think he would ever feel too much fear to carry on? And did he end up hating the sea? 'No, I love the sea. But the sea rules, there's never been any doubt about that. I feel privileged to have been able to experience that - never seen a storm like that before. It was probably the most frightening and most dangerous sail I've ever had - but it was also the most exhilarating.</p> <p>'And the fear..oh, God, I'm not one for sitting around staring at my navel. But I remember there was one guy who was getting hypnosis to help him deal with the fear of death. I thought, bloody hell, if I felt like that I wouldn't go. What's the point?'</p> <p>His Boy's Own stoicism may be maddening to some, for Pete Goss is not a whirling hotbed of emotion. But his character means he can bounce back and plan again, even though he's promised not to commit to anything for three months. 'I had a brilliant year last year, tremendous ups and downs, like 10 years of life condensed into a year - and it was a success, for Team Philips was about much more than just a boat. But I'm just going to enjoy life for a bit, see my family.'</p> <p>And sail? 'Maybe. Although I don't have..' he smiles... 'I can't afford a boat.'</p> <p>Too often, sadly, the nature of obsession can mean that, if failure follows, what once looked brave and focused can end up looking faintly ridiculous. That Pete Goss and his quiet confidence will succeed in the end is not in doubt; for I don't think I've met anyone less ridiculous in my life.</p>",

You'd go into a wave and think, this is it, we've bloody had it. But she would drag us out of it. And she never really, with hindsight, took me somewhere I didn't want to go. So the concept was safe. 'I'm not a risk taker for the sake of it. I've got a family, and I want to come home. The reason I do it is because I love it. There are times I've been really frightened, but there is this thing that knowledge dispels fear, and so you minimise risk wherever you can.' Did he think he would ever feel too much fear to carry on? And did he end up hating the sea? 'No, I love the sea. But the sea rules, there's never been any doubt about that. I feel privileged to have been able to experience that - never seen a storm like that before. It was probably the most frightening and most dangerous sail I've ever had - but it was also the most exhilarating. 'And the fear..oh, God, I'm not one for sitting around staring at my navel. But I remember there was one guy who was getting hypnosis to help him deal with the fear of death. I thought, bloody hell, if I felt like that I wouldn't go. What's the point?' His Boy's Own stoicism may be maddening to some, for Pete Goss is not a whirling hotbed of emotion. But his character means he can bounce back and plan again, even though he's promised not to commit to anything for three months. 'I had a brilliant year last year, tremendous ups and downs, like 10 years of life condensed into a year - and it was a success, for Team Philips was about much more than just a boat. But I'm just going to enjoy life for a bit, see my family.' And sail? 'Maybe. Although I don't have..' he smiles... 'I can't afford a boat.' Too often, sadly, the nature of obsession can mean that, if failure follows, what once looked brave and focused can end up looking faintly ridiculous. That Pete Goss and his quiet confidence will succeed in the end is not in doubt; for I don't think I've met anyone less ridiculous in my life.",

But if you think you could get it wrong, you may want to err on the generous side - otherwise you will find yourself being charged interest at 8.5 per cent on any shortfall.

Murphy thinks that this is such a donor-friendly system that it is 'open to abuse'. All you need to have done was make a donation to a charity in a recorded, structured form - by cheque, for instance, rather than into a collecting tin - and given the charity your details. You only need to have given the charity your details once in the year for the subsequent payments also to qualify for the tax relief. You do not need to have a receipt for each donation: a note in your diary or on cheque stubs would do.</p> <p>The charity will have claimed tax relief on your donation, assuming you paid tax at the basic rate - but you can also benefit by claiming back the difference between higher- and basic- rate on the sum.</p> <p>As you go through the tax return, you should remember that some assets and income are outside the tax system - individual savings accounts and Child Benefit, for instance, and do not need even to be mentioned on the form. Similarly, if you are letting out a room in your house under the 'Rent A Room' scheme, you do not have to put down details. If your circumstances have changed from last year, or you think that some figures look odd, you run the risk of inviting difficult questions from the Inland Revenue - or even unleashing a dreaded 'inquiry' or investigation.</p> <p>Jane Moore of the charity TaxAid says: 'If you are using estimates instead of actual figures, it is a good idea to disclose the reasons why on the bits of white space that are on the form.'

'It's worth doing this,' says Moore. 'If there is a query, the person inputting the information may use the telephone number. But if they can't get hold of you, they may just reject the return.' </p> <p>And if you cannot pay your 31 January bill on time, you are also far better off negotiating. Moore says: 'Approach the Revenue as soon as you can. If you can set up an agreed payment arrangement before 28 February, they will probably waive the surcharge. Negotiations depend on the case - the person's compliance history, the size of the debt and what sort of proposal they have.

In theory, you can receive up to seven years in jail and unlimited fines for tax evasion but, in practice, it is aimed at fraudsters rather than the dopey or scatter-brained.

In fact, these seemingly idyllic surroundings can exacerbate feelings of insecurity and inferiority among those prone to take their own lives. One academic believes a fabulous climate, a mood of economic optimism and a glowing international reputation as a healthy and successful nation intensify depression in potentially suicidal people. Professor Jim Barber of Flinders University in Adelaide said images of bronzed lifeguards and toned beach goddesses put pressure on troubled youngsters and make them concerned that they feel down in a great place. 'If you are surrounded by people who are having fun and getting on and you are not and you are feeling miserable then you are relatively unhappy. So a suicide risk factor is, paradoxically, a happy country,' said Barber. 'You compare yourself with others and see them as much happier, so you feel isolated and out of step with your peers.' His research challenges long-held beliefs that suicide is more likely among those living in economically depressed countries with bleaker climates. In research to be published in next month's Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, Barber also blames a lingering macho attitude to life. The rugged 'Aussie battler' spirit that built the nation is now doing it no favours by placing a stigma on men who look for help. 'When boys feel down and depressed they don't talk about it among themselves,' he said. Many suicides are of gay men often repressed in small towns by Australia's still widespread homophobia. 'We have to promote more realistic images of growing up', said Barber. And we have to be able to get depressed people, especially men, to say when they feel down and to seek help.'",

Mikio Miyazawa - who worked for Interbrand, a London-based marketing consultancy - was found dead in his home last weekend with multiple knife wounds to the neck. His wife Yasuko, a teacher, and their eight-year-old daughter and six-year-old son were killed in their beds. Police believe the assailant or assailants entered the house looking for money or documents. Two empty wallets were found at the scene and papers were strewn around the house. Interbrand, which specialises in corporate identity and branding strategies, has many high-profile clients. The company has offices in 19 cities worldwide. Company officials were unavailable for comment, but colleagues of Miyazawa said they thought it was unlikely his murder was job-related. 'He wasn't working on anything particularly sensitive or controversial,' said one associate, interviewed on Japanese television. 'He was a congenial man who got on well with everyone - definitely not the sort of person to make enemies.' The murders have added to fears of a breakdown in Japan's low-crime society amid high unemployment, large-scale illegal immigration and a widespread questioning of traditional values. Television news programmes have repeatedly played video footage of Miyazawa's children - Niina in her ballet costume and Rei at his nursery school - and newspapers have avidly followed the police hunt for the killers. Reflecting the intense public concern, the superintendent-general of the Metropolitan Police Department made a personal inspection of the crime scene - the first time that the capital's police chief has taken such a hands-on approach. 'This is an extremely brutal crime,' Takeshi Noda told detectives. 'Do whatever you can to arrest the culprit.' There is no shortage of clues. Police have found the two knives used in the killings and a bloodied sweatshirt and glove abandoned by a wounded assailant at the scene of the crime. A taxi driver has reported picking up three middle-aged men near the area around the time of the murder, at least one of whom left bloody marks on the seat. After a year of police scandals and criticism that authorities are losing the fight against crime, detectives are under pressure to make an arrest quickly. According to the National Police Agency, a record 2.23 million crimes were reported in the first 11 months of last year, up 12.5 per cent on the same period in 1999.

Between them, father and sons wrote several hundred popular dances for the ballrooms of nineteenth-century Vienna. For 51 weeks of the year, their music today is virtually ignored. In the fifty-second, a curious fever takes grip. The catchy melodies and clockwork exactness of these brief works seem to embody end-of-year oblivion. Even the Viennese themselves have begun to believe their own imagined past, a time of short-lived opulence and brittle confidence before old Austria vanished in 1914. Recently, the statue of Johann Strauss the younger, the fiddler 'Waltz King', has been dressed in gold leaf in its Art Nouveau grotto, gilding his reputation and Vienna's collective memories in one artful stroke.</p> <p>It was he who gave us most of the best-known 'Strauss' waltzes, including 'The Blue Danube' and 'Wiener Blut'. His masterpiece, however, was <b>Die Fledermaus</b>, considered by connoisseurs to be the purest of all operettas. London City Opera staged the work in English at the South Bank over New Year. A bitter-sweet study of marriage, money and class, Fledermaus may at first sight seem to bury no deeper ambition beneath its fizzing superficiality. Yet Strauss was more canny than might appear. In his handling of disguise and counter-disguise, he exposes harsh home truths about mankind's ability for self-delusion; as Alfred, the Italian tenor in love with the married Rosalinda, observes: 'Happy the person who can forget what cannot be altered.' A good performance should be like Schnitzler on wheels.</p> <p>LCO's staging (by Tom Hawkes) was sturdy and unfussy. A fixed set of columns and steps represented a sunny spa town. Singing and acting were crisp, with good ensemble and none of the star indulgence which too often wrecks Fledermaus productions. As Eisenstein, Andrew Forbes Lane proved himself a master of comic timing. Constance Novis (Rosalinda) had the vocal stamina for her demanding Czardas. As Prince Orlofsky, the spirited Juliet Norman cut a dashing 'principal boy' figure, deftly maintaining her witty cod-Russian accent. Martin Handley conducted the small band with zest and diligence. Stylistically the playing had little in the way of Viennese swing, but it was accurate and rhythmic, key Strauss ingredients.</p> <p>The Waltz King's 'Roses from the South' acted as the Viennese cream filling between the Creation and the End of Time in a chamber concert given by the violinist <b>Ernst Kovacic and friends</b> at the Wigmore Hall. Milhaud was one of the circle of composers around Cocteau nicknamed Les Six. He found inspiration for a ballet, La Cr\u00e9ation du monde, in the black jazz music of Harlem which he heard in New York in 1922. His plan was to relate the story of creation through African legend, incorporating rain birds, witches, fetishists, soothsayers and the like. His collaborator was Blaise Cendrars who, in addition to being a diamond-dealer, lorry driver, friend of Charlie Chaplin and drinking companion of Stravinsky, had compiled an influential Anthologie n\u00e8gre. The version played here was for piano quintet. Without the exotic sonorities of the 17-instrument original, the work had a spikier focus.</p> <p>Kovacic and his players, with the ever characterful David Owen Norris as pianist, brought lean energy to this compact and brightly explosive work. In contrast, 'Roses from the South' had precisely the right degree of smooth, central-European finesse. Kovacic, an Austrian, knows how to waltz to perfection, tripping idiomatically on the beat while second violin and viola hiccupped gracefully on (or off) their accompanying parts. Krysia Osostowicz, violin, and Judith Busbridge, viola, were expert dance partners, with the cellist Raphael Wallfisch smilingly supportive in the bass line.</p> <p>His moment of glory came in the chief work of the evening, Messiaen's Quartet For The End Of Time. A song-like cello solo, here caressingly played, occupies the still heart of this visionary work, written for fellow prisoners of war and first performed (on barely adequate instruments) in 1941.

He was also a distinguished pianist and a music critic for this newspaper. His ability to see connections between music of different styles, tastes and epochs had an influence on programme-making which is still felt, especially in the planning of the Proms. A concert to celebrate his life was held at St John's Smith Square to an invited audience conspicuous for the number of composers present (though Glock, famously, had his blind spots, and one or two may have stayed away).

An air of earnest nostalgia and warm-hearted reverence pervaded. Concerts once needed to be like this, but life has moved on. Glock's successors consider it natural to contrast music of different periods; to mix ancient and modern, oddball and mainstream.

      "byline": "Neasa MacErlean",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>If you are filling in your own tax return this month, you could be in for a shock. The calculation for the tax due has expanded from 8 pages to 28 since last year - becoming so complicated that even professionals admit to getting it wrong if they use pen and paper rather than software. </p> <p>You can thank Chancellor Gordon Brown for the new complexity. Even if your affairs are fairly straightforward, you could still find yourself, for instance, calculating your tax liability at six different rates for 1999/00 - zero, 10, 20, 23, 32 and 40 per cent. 'The potential for error in the tax calculation is very high if you are doing it yourself,' says Marco Spano of accountant HLB Kidsons in Hove, East Sussex. </p> <p>But there are ways of limiting the pain. 'If you get the calculation wrong, the Inland Revenue should spot it and will tell you,' says John Whiting of PricewaterhouseCoopers. But if you think you could get it wrong, you may want to err on the generous side - otherwise you will find yourself being charged interest at 8.5 per cent on any shortfall. Although the Revenue should discover all calculation errors, it could take them a couple of months to do so at this time of year. </p> <p>As well as getting the tax return in by 31 January, many taxpayers - particularly those with self-employed earnings or income from letting out property - are due to pay some tax on that date. There is an automatic \u00a3100 fine for returns which come in late - although, after a legal challenge in 1999, this deadline has been pushed back to include tax returns which are on the mat when Inland Revenue offices open up for business on 2 February. Late payments of tax attract the interest charge and a 5 per cent surcharge on sums relating to the 99/00 tax year if still unpaid on 28 February.</p> <p>Another way round the problem is still to ask the Inland Revenue to calculate your tax bill for you. The Revenue tries to encourage people who want the calculation done for them to get the return in by the end of September - but will do the calculations all the year round.</p> <p>If you follow this route, and think you have some tax to pay, you could make a rough estimate for yourself and pay in that sum to reduce your chance of being charged interest. </p> <p>The 28-page Inland Revenue calculation is designed to cover every possibility for every taxpayer, so you could produce your own tailormade procedure, if your confidence in your arithmetic is strong enough. Similarly, you could take advantage of the tax calculator on the Inland Revenue website (under Self-Assessment). </p> <p>But before you reach the calculation stage, you need to gather together the basic information. 'If the worst comes to the worst, nearly every bank provides details of interest payments over the phone,' says tax adviser Richard Murphy. 'And most companies will say on their websites what their dividend is per share.' </p> <p>Most employers can readily supply your income information (but make sure you write down income after payments into a company pension scheme - otherwise you can lose some of your hard-earned tax relief) and details of benefits in kind.</p> <p>You also need to check that you have all the pages you need in the tax return: if you need the pages for partnership, for example, or share schemes, you can download them from the Inland Revenue website or ring up the orderline and ask for them. </p> <p>Higher-rate taxpayers should get the benefit of any charitable contributions they made. </p> <p>Charitable giving was made easier for the Millennium - and you can claim back your higher rate of tax on donations where you gave the charity your name and address. Murphy thinks that this is such a donor-friendly system that it is 'open to abuse'. All you need to have done was make a donation to a charity in a recorded, structured form - by cheque, for instance, rather than into a collecting tin - and given the charity your details. You only need to have given the charity your details once in the year for the subsequent payments also to qualify for the tax relief. You do not need to have a receipt for each donation: a note in your diary or on cheque stubs would do.</p> <p>The charity will have claimed tax relief on your donation, assuming you paid tax at the basic rate - but you can also benefit by claiming back the difference between higher- and basic- rate on the sum.</p> <p>As you go through the tax return, you should remember that some assets and income are outside the tax system - individual savings accounts and Child Benefit, for instance, and do not need even to be mentioned on the form. Similarly, if you are letting out a room in your house under the 'Rent A Room' scheme, you do not have to put down details. If your circumstances have changed from last year, or you think that some figures look odd, you run the risk of inviting difficult questions from the Inland Revenue - or even unleashing a dreaded 'inquiry' or investigation.</p> <p>Jane Moore of the charity TaxAid says: 'If you are using estimates instead of actual figures, it is a good idea to disclose the reasons why on the bits of white space that are on the form.' So a short explanation - 'my freelance income dropped 50 per cent this year while I went travelling around the world' - could save you a lot of heartache later on. </p> <p>Another useful move is to put your daytime telephone number down where you are given the option to do this on page seven of the return. 'It's worth doing this,' says Moore. 'If there is a query, the person inputting the information may use the telephone number. But if they can't get hold of you, they may just reject the return.' </p> <p>And if you cannot pay your 31 January bill on time, you are also far better off negotiating. Moore says: 'Approach the Revenue as soon as you can. If you can set up an agreed payment arrangement before 28 February, they will probably waive the surcharge. Negotiations depend on the case - the person's compliance history, the size of the debt and what sort of proposal they have.

      "bodyText": "If you are filling in your own tax return this month, you could be in for a shock. The calculation for the tax due has expanded from 8 pages to 28 since last year - becoming so complicated that even professionals admit to getting it wrong if they use pen and paper rather than software. You can thank Chancellor Gordon Brown for the new complexity. Even if your affairs are fairly straightforward, you could still find yourself, for instance, calculating your tax liability at six different rates for 1999/00 - zero, 10, 20, 23, 32 and 40 per cent. 'The potential for error in the tax calculation is very high if you are doing it yourself,' says Marco Spano of accountant HLB Kidsons in Hove, East Sussex. But there are ways of limiting the pain. 'If you get the calculation wrong, the Inland Revenue should spot it and will tell you,' says John Whiting of PricewaterhouseCoopers. But if you think you could get it wrong, you may want to err on the generous side - otherwise you will find yourself being charged interest at 8.5 per cent on any shortfall. Although the Revenue should discover all calculation errors, it could take them a couple of months to do so at this time of year. As well as getting the tax return in by 31 January, many taxpayers - particularly those with self-employed earnings or income from letting out property - are due to pay some tax on that date. There is an automatic \u00a3100 fine for returns which come in late - although, after a legal challenge in 1999, this deadline has been pushed back to include tax returns which are on the mat when Inland Revenue offices open up for business on 2 February. Late payments of tax attract the interest charge and a 5 per cent surcharge on sums relating to the 99/00 tax year if still unpaid on 28 February. Another way round the problem is still to ask the Inland Revenue to calculate your tax bill for you. The Revenue tries to encourage people who want the calculation done for them to get the return in by the end of September - but will do the calculations all the year round. If you follow this route, and think you have some tax to pay, you could make a rough estimate for yourself and pay in that sum to reduce your chance of being charged interest. The 28-page Inland Revenue calculation is designed to cover every possibility for every taxpayer, so you could produce your own tailormade procedure, if your confidence in your arithmetic is strong enough. Similarly, you could take advantage of the tax calculator on the Inland Revenue website (under Self-Assessment). But before you reach the calculation stage, you need to gather together the basic information. 'If the worst comes to the worst, nearly every bank provides details of interest payments over the phone,' says tax adviser Richard Murphy. 'And most companies will say on their websites what their dividend is per share.' Most employers can readily supply your income information (but make sure you write down income after payments into a company pension scheme - otherwise you can lose some of your hard-earned tax relief) and details of benefits in kind. You also need to check that you have all the pages you need in the tax return: if you need the pages for partnership, for example, or share schemes, you can download them from the Inland Revenue website or ring up the orderline and ask for them. Higher-rate taxpayers should get the benefit of any charitable contributions they made. Charitable giving was made easier for the Millennium - and you can claim back your higher rate of tax on donations where you gave the charity your name and address. Murphy thinks that this is such a donor-friendly system that it is 'open to abuse'. All you need to have done was make a donation to a charity in a recorded, structured form - by cheque, for instance, rather than into a collecting tin - and given the charity your details. You only need to have given the charity your details once in the year for the subsequent payments also to qualify for the tax relief. You do not need to have a receipt for each donation: a note in your diary or on cheque stubs would do. The charity will have claimed tax relief on your donation, assuming you paid tax at the basic rate - but you can also benefit by claiming back the difference between higher- and basic- rate on the sum. As you go through the tax return, you should remember that some assets and income are outside the tax system - individual savings accounts and Child Benefit, for instance, and do not need even to be mentioned on the form. Similarly, if you are letting out a room in your house under the 'Rent A Room' scheme, you do not have to put down details. If your circumstances have changed from last year, or you think that some figures look odd, you run the risk of inviting difficult questions from the Inland Revenue - or even unleashing a dreaded 'inquiry' or investigation. Jane Moore of the charity TaxAid says: 'If you are using estimates instead of actual figures, it is a good idea to disclose the reasons why on the bits of white space that are on the form.' So a short explanation - 'my freelance income dropped 50 per cent this year while I went travelling around the world' - could save you a lot of heartache later on. Another useful move is to put your daytime telephone number down where you are given the option to do this on page seven of the return. 'It's worth doing this,' says Moore. 'If there is a query, the person inputting the information may use the telephone number. But if they can't get hold of you, they may just reject the return.' And if you cannot pay your 31 January bill on time, you are also far better off negotiating. Moore says: 'Approach the Revenue as soon as you can. If you can set up an agreed payment arrangement before 28 February, they will probably waive the surcharge. Negotiations depend on the case - the person's compliance history, the size of the debt and what sort of proposal they have. If they think you can pay it off in two to three months, they'd probably be responsive to that. But if it's a year, they'd probably say no.'

'A lot of our market has been driven by new developments, and demand was strong right the way up to Christmas.

The story is identical at the top end of the market - \u00a31 million or more - where there is overseas interest as well as British. </p> <p>'Because of the rise in the number of international buyers following the fall of the pound against the dollar, we can comfortably predict a further 10 per cent rise in 2001,' says Grant Alexson of Knight Frank. 'There will be no boom and bust and no sharp deviations.' </p> <p>The London scene will be, as ever, aggressive. In the realistically priced part of the market the final six weeks of 2000 were unusually hectic.</p> <p>'We have seen large amounts of property sold, mainly in the low to middle market, which points to a very active early part of 2001,' says Peter Rollings, managing director of London agents Foxtons.

      "bodyText": "If you are buying or selling a house in 2001, remember the old clich\u00e9 that the early bird catches the worm. Most property experts across the country say there will be a 6-10 per cent price rise in house prices this year and perhaps up to 15 per cent on larger country homes - and most of those increases will take place between now and summer. 'There is now a lot of pent-up demand, and we envisage activity developing in February and March,' says upmarket agent Knight Frank's Edward Rook. Some of the busiest areas are not the usual suspects of London and the South East. 'I have absolutely no problem in predicting that the Northern Ireland market will continue growing,' says David Cairns, of the Eric Cairns agency in Belfast. 'A lot of our market has been driven by new developments, and demand was strong right the way up to Christmas. In mid-December I sold 30 apartments, off plan, which were located by the Foyle in Derry, and which will not be complete until autumn 2001.' In Wales it is the same. 'It's been very buoyant, mostly driven by new developments in the centre and near Cardiff Bay,' says surveyor Michael Young. The story is identical at the top end of the market - \u00a31 million or more - where there is overseas interest as well as British. 'Because of the rise in the number of international buyers following the fall of the pound against the dollar, we can comfortably predict a further 10 per cent rise in 2001,' says Grant Alexson of Knight Frank. 'There will be no boom and bust and no sharp deviations.' The London scene will be, as ever, aggressive. In the realistically priced part of the market the final six weeks of 2000 were unusually hectic. 'We have seen large amounts of property sold, mainly in the low to middle market, which points to a very active early part of 2001,' says Peter Rollings, managing director of London agents Foxtons. 'We are predicting a rise of between 8 per cent and 10 per cent during the first quarter of 2001. We would then expect the market to calm for a period of months before again recovering towards the autumn of 2001.' At the top end, City bonuses may not have quite the effect they have had in past years. 'Predictions for bonuses across the board are that they will be down on last year and people won't feel as rich as they have done,' says David Forbes, of central London agency Chesterfield. London lettings have recently been boosted by commuters who want temporary accommodation during the rail chaos, but some agents believe the rental market will suffer as the sales market picks up. 'Given an increase in rents of 7-10 per cent in 2000, we would expect letting to fall back slightly in the new year to reflect the predicted rise in sales for the next six months,' says Ian Stone of agent Bushells in south and west London. But the north-south divide continues in housing. England's worst-hit area remains the North East, where past and future house price rises are as far away as ever.

You may be short of money, but you can use your time to give yourself a money makeover. You do not need qualifications to sort out your financial priorities: much of it boils down to common sense supported by a little understanding. </p> <p>First you must establish where you stand today, and for that you need to draw up a budget (see opposite). You may be able to see immediately where you are wasting money or being extravagant. You may find you are paying for house insurance through your lender and also with a separate policy. Perhaps your house insurance covers your holiday needs as well. </p> <p>When you have written down everything you spend money on, list all the financial products you have bought. This may take time to pull together and could include: </p> <p>\u0095 Cheque account </p> <p>\u0095 Savings accounts at banks and building societies </p> <p>\u0095 Individual Savings Account (Isa) </p> <p>\u0095 National Savings </p> <p>\u0095 Shares, gilts, unit trusts, oeics or investment trusts </p> <p>\u0095 Investment bonds </p> <p>\u0095 Tessa </p> <p>\u0095 Personal equity plan </p> <p>\u0095 Life insurance, with your mortgage or separately (endowment, whole life or term insurance) </p> <p>\u0095 Health insurance (income protection, loan protection, critical illness, long-term care, private medical insurance or hospital cash benefit). </p> <p>\u0095 Pension, through your job or privately, and additional voluntary contributions. </p> <p>Remember to include any financial protection that you do not pay for, such as life insurance or sick pay that comes with your job, and make sure you know exactly what you get. Joanne Cox, of Co-operative Bank Financial Advisers, says: 'People don't have any idea how long their employer will pay if they are off ill, or how much they will get, no idea of pension benefits or life insurance.' </p> <p>She tells them to look at the booklets the company provides: 'Your employer has a duty to inform you, and most do, but it is up to you to read the booklets.' </p> <p>If your pay package includes life insurance, you do not have to buy more for yourself. But do consider how long your job will last because, if you change jobs, you immediately lose this life cover. You can at that point buy your own policy but, as you will be older when you start, the premiums are higher and, if your health has deteriorated, could be out of reach. You should also check whether your employer's insurance includes cover for your spouse. </p> <p>You need to plan for the future whatever your age, whether you are starting work or have already retired. The Government has made it clear that everyone who can afford to save must take care of themselves, as no future administration will be able to provide. </p> <p>Anyone who has recently left university probably owes a large amount of money in student loans and overdrafts, so they need to establish a debt repayment programme before starting to think about saving. </p> <p>But financial planning for 20-year-olds is not limited to coping with debt because the younger you start investing or building a pension, the less it will cost overall (see table above right). The sooner you get into the habit of putting money aside regularly, the less you will miss it. </p> <p>Cox explains: 'If you are fairly young, the cumulative effect of saving over time has a snowball effect. It is better to save \u00a320 a month for 25 years than delay and put in \u00a350 a month for 10 years. Although the amount you pay in is the same, the amount you get out at the end is radically different because it has had time to accumulate. You do not need a fortune if you start early.' </p> <p>The list of financial products is not a target but shows what is available so you can decide which you may find useful and which you can afford. Over the next few weeks, Cash will tell you more about them; but broadly you can see which are essential, which desirable and which you can do without </p> <p>Once you start shopping for financial products, spend time on your research. The internet has made this easy, or you can telephone for a brochure. Get details from several different companies and go through the literature carefully. </p> <p>Cox advises: 'Read the small print. It is amazing what you can find. The product may not be what you thought it was. For example, you might think you are getting life insurance but on closer examination find it is accident insurance.' Be careful not to sign up for a product that looks favourable but has penalties if you need to change or within 12 months decide it is inappropriate and therefore give it up altogether. </p> <p>Here are other top tips from financial experts:</p> <p>\u0095 Do not pay too much tax: non-taxpayers, including children, should sign form IR85 available from bank and building society branches and tax offices so interest is paid without tax being deducted. </p> <p>\u0095 Check your tax code: you cannot assume the Inland Revenue has it right</p> <p>\u0095 Index everything. When you pay in to a pension or investment, build in an automatic annual increase in contributions from the start. It will cost you only a few pennies extra each month. This way your money keeps its value. It need only be a nominal 5 per cent to outpace inflation at present. </p> <p>\u0095 If you need a pension, look at stakeholder pensions, which arrive in April. Andy Agar, pensions marketing director of Legal &amp; General, says: 'Customers buying stakeholder pensions can have confidence that the terms are benchmarked by the Government and there are no longer any hidden charges.' The minimum stakeholder contribution will be \u00a320 a month gross, but what you actually pay will be less than that because the tax relief is added on. </p> <p>\u0095 Keep your options flexible. Mortgages and pensions used to tie you down, but modern versions allow you to change your contributions and even take a payment holiday. With stakeholder pensions, you can start paying in when you are young - with spare cash and no family commitments?. When you start a family and the costs build up, you can reduce or stop your contributions without penalty and then start building them up again as money gets easier. </p> <p>\u0095 Parents and grandparents can take out a stakeholder pension for the children; spouses on behalf of a non-working partner. The recipient does not have to be earning or paying tax yet can have contributions paid on their behalf up to \u00a3300 a month or \u00a33,600 a year with no questions asked. The person contributing gets basic-rate tax relief. </p> <p>\u0095 A pension is not necessarily the best choice for people on lower incomes because the money is locked away until they retire. You should still save, but an Isa may be better as you can access the money if they really need it. The downside is that the money is available and you may be tempted to use it. </p> <p>\u0095 Check that you are paying the least you can for a mortgage. If your own lender has a better product, ask if you can switch. If not, remortgage to a different lender. </p> <p>\u0095 Move your current account to one that pays better interest. </p> <p>\u0095 Financial planning is not a one-off exercise. You need to keep reviewing your investments. Everyone plans to but, in reality, fails. Cox warns: 'Don't be lazy and leave all your money in a low-paying deposit ac-count that was good when you started.' </p> <p>Bina Abel, an independent financial adviser with Bradford &amp; Bingley, says: 'Life does move on. Every time there is any change in your circumstances, come back to look at your budget again.'</p> <p><strong>Mortgage, insurance, bills but don't forget CDs and chardonnay</strong></p> <p>You may be tempted to ignore this section if you feel you have no money, but everyone should budget. Joanne Cox of the Coop says: 'It is not a matter of how much you earn: people spend what they earn.'</p> <p>You can ignore financial planning only if you always have plenty of money for all you want and need. For the rest of us, a little planning can cut costs and avoid wastage. You can do nothing until you know exactly where you stand. This means adding up all the money you have coming in: salary, overtime, bonuses, any other jobs, pension, state benefits, rental income, maintenance payments, interest from deposit accounts and dividends from investments. </p> <p>You may not regard all this as spending money. You may put your Child Benefit straight into a savings scheme. Or you may reinvest dividends. Ignore those amounts: you are trying to find out exactly how much money you have available to spend. </p> <p>Then calculate your outgoings. This is more difficult than it sounds because small items nibble away at your money and are easy to overlook. You can readily find the figures for mortgage or rent, council tax and utility bills. You may have a reasonable idea how much you spend on food. But you may be deceiving yourself about your booze bill or other weaknesses - be disciplined and realistic. Then add occasional items down to hairdos, makeup, birthday cards, flowers, dry cleaning, magazines and postage stamps.</p> <p>Starting now, write down every penny you spend over a month. You will get a few surprises. Keep the list going for a full year, to include seasonal variations and you will get bigger shocks. There is no need to stop buying treats, but they should be a conscious decision you know you can afford.</p> <p><strong>Wise counsel for counsellor</strong></p> <p>Jan Woodhouse is 55 and has two sons in their twenties but she still has the low-income problems of youngsters just starting their working lives. For 11 years she worked as an administrator for the Kent Institute of Art and Design, but last August took voluntary redundancy and received an ex gratia payment of \u00a35,102. </p> <p>She has registered for Jobseeker's Allowance and started part-time tutoring in English and mathematics for \u00a311 an hour. Her earning time is limited, though, because the rest of her time is spent studying for a diploma in counselling, which she is paying for herself. When she completes the course, she hopes to find part-time counselling work and start a private practice but says that, realistically, she will not be earning more than \u00a320,000 a year. </p> <p>Jan had been contributing to a company pension since 1996 but had to stop when she left her job. She has no plans to retire: 'I expect to continue working for as long as my physical and mental health allow.' She wants to know how to manage her small income to her best advantage, and provide peace of mind for later. </p> <p>While Jan has the same financial worries as young people, she has far less time in which to save for her future. As her children are grown up, her priority now is her own finances. </p> <p>She should follow the budget plan (page 3) to make sure she is not wasting money anywhere and establish exactly where she stands financially - whether she has insurance policies she no longer needs, an emergency fund and enough money to see her through studying. </p> <p>Although she has no plans to retire, she should be saving for a time when she is no longer earning, using the \u00a35,102 as a starting point. This could be through a stakeholder pension or an Isa - depending on whether she wants to tie up her money. She can contact the Benefits Agency or phone 0191 2187585 for a forecast of how much state pension she will receive and a valuation of the company pension from her former employer. </p> <p><strong>What bank manager?</strong></p> <p>Thw role of the traditional bank manager has disappeared.

Advisers are qualified and will advise on the best way to sort out investments within our own product range.'</p> <p>Banks with an independent financial subsidiary provide a more detailed service. Seymour adds: 'If you want advice on investments not provided by Alliance &amp; Leicester, you can make an appointment, at home or at a branch, with someone from Alliance &amp; Leicester Independent Financial Advisers. There is no fee and, if someone does not want to buy an investment, this is not a problem. It is not out of reach and you can get good advice without it costing you.' </p> <p>Bina Abel of Bradford &amp; Bingley says her organisation has a similar service: 'I could see 10 people over a couple of days. The fact that we don't charge means I see a wide cross-section of the public. The commission we earn from larger investors enables us to help smaller ones.'</p> <p><strong>At debt's door</strong></p> <p>Repay debts as fast as you can, starting with the most expensive, but make sure with all of them that you are paying the lowest rate of interest. You do not need to stick with a mortgage or credit card if others offer cheaper rates. </p> <p>Credit card companies are so competitive at the moment that you can play one off against another. Geoff Seymour, of Alliance &amp; Leicester, suggests: 'Switch to a credit card with a very low rate of interest on the balance you transfer.' </p> <p>Joanne Cox, of the Coop, says: 'Have just one credit card, with a low rate of interest, but watch for conditions. There are some very low rates for six months to attract you, but they often have steep charges if you make a late payment or want an extra statement. This is how they get their money back. Understand what you are getting into in the contract and be aware of all the charges you may be paying.' </p> <p>Limit your credit cards: it is easier to control one or two. You can delude yourself if you have half a dozen cards each with a small balance.The statements arrive at different times of the month and none looks a lot of money. But it all adds up. If all your credit spending is on one bill, you can easily see what you have spent. This will help you be more disciplined. Some borrowers are better off with a personal loan than a credit card, even though the interest rate is higher. You borrow a fixed amount which you repay over a set period. This eliminates temptation because you cannot borrow any more and must keep up with repayments every month. </p> <p>Avoid store cards: they are expensive. Spending \u00a35,000 on a store card and paying it back over two years costs \u00a36,473 at a typical 29.9 per cent. Says Seymour: 'If you owe \u00a35,000 on a store card, and transfer the balance to an Alliance &amp; Leicester Diamond card, with its special transfer balance rate of 6.8 per cent, you could save \u00a31,626 paying it back over two years. On a typical credit card, you could save \u00a3787.40 in two years.' The Halifax credit card starts from 2 per cent.</p> <p><strong>What's important - and what's not</strong></p> <p>Before making any decisions, get your priorities sorted. These should be: </p> <p>\u0095 protecting your income </p> <p>\u0095 protecting your dependants with life insurance </p> <p>\u0095 your pension </p> <p>\u0095 your savings. </p> <p>Bina Abel, of Bradford &amp; Bingley, says: 'It is not easy to prioritise the financial products to buy because each individual's circumstances are different.' You need to decide what is most appropriate for your own situation. </p> <p>'Pensions are important, but I might tell a young person to save although not in a pension, because there is danger that they get trapped into arrangements too young. It may be more sensible for them to save in an Isa, because the money can still be used for a pension, but they may need it for a house deposit.' </p> <p>Andy Agar, of Legal and General, adds: 'The Government has tried to say that if you earn below around \u00a310,000, you shouldn't save your hard-earned money because you are better relying on the state. If you are on the margin, you have a difficult choice. My advice would be that if you earn over that threshold you should save' </p> <p>If you cannot afford everything, it is better to spread your money over two or three important areas, rather than concentrating on one and ignoring the others. If you have \u00a350 a month to spare and two young children, you need life insurance and you need a pension. </p> <p>You will be tempted to delay starting a pension, but you may find you never get round to it and, anyway, it will cost you more later on (see table, page 5. Everyone needs a pension, unless you have wealthy parents who will leave you all their money. </p> <p>Joanne Cox, of the Coop, says she plays the consequences game with clients who cannot decide what to buy: 'I ask them: \"What would the consequences be if you had died yesterday? How much pension would your wife have? Would the mortgage be paid off? If not, could she pay it? Does she work? If there is nothing left in the pot, could she manage on her earnings?\" That shows them the choices they have to make. If the outlook is really grim, and the family would be out on the street, you need to do something.'</p>",

But if you simply need to check that you are being sensible with money, or want tips on making ends meet, opportunities are limited. Independent financial advisers make a living either from commission on the investments they sell or from charging fees for their time. A thorough analysis of your financial position takes two or three hours and advisers' fees start at \u00a3100 an hour. But it is not feasible to pay \u00a3200 for a check-up when you do not have that much money to spare. If you had that sort of money, you could usefully add it to your savings. The answer is to do it yourself. You may be short of money, but you can use your time to give yourself a money makeover. You do not need qualifications to sort out your financial priorities: much of it boils down to common sense supported by a little understanding. First you must establish where you stand today, and for that you need to draw up a budget (see opposite). You may be able to see immediately where you are wasting money or being extravagant. You may find you are paying for house insurance through your lender and also with a separate policy. Perhaps your house insurance covers your holiday needs as well.

It may be more sensible for them to save in an Isa, because the money can still be used for a pension, but they may need it for a house deposit.' Andy Agar, of Legal and General, adds: 'The Government has tried to say that if you earn below around \u00a310,000, you shouldn't save your hard-earned money because you are better relying on the state. If you are on the margin, you have a difficult choice. My advice would be that if you earn over that threshold you should save' If you cannot afford everything, it is better to spread your money over two or three important areas, rather than concentrating on one and ignoring the others. If you have \u00a350 a month to spare and two young children, you need life insurance and you need a pension. You will be tempted to delay starting a pension, but you may find you never get round to it and, anyway, it will cost you more later on (see table, page 5. Everyone needs a pension, unless you have wealthy parents who will leave you all their money. Joanne Cox, of the Coop, says she plays the consequences game with clients who cannot decide what to buy: 'I ask them: \"What would the consequences be if you had died yesterday? How much pension would your wife have? Would the mortgage be paid off? If not, could she pay it? Does she work? If there is nothing left in the pot, could she manage on her earnings?\" That shows them the choices they have to make. If the outlook is really grim, and the family would be out on the street, you need to do something.'",

It was originally called 'The Chemist Fa\u00e7ade' but the record label were quite worried about having a song about condoms. It was our first and only No 1 out of all our hits. We were in Japan at the time. It was about 9 o'clock in the morning when we found out, not a time for partying, but the bass player from the Jam rang us to say congratulations.

At a glance, the top 15 makes a sort of sense - the right-ish names, the right-ish songs, the right-ish mixture of the cracked, the camp, the intense, the treacly and the classic, nicely easing back and forwards through the decades. Then you notice Spiller, the one song from 2000 that was on the short list. You sense hordes of people who weren't born in the Sixties or the Seventies, or even the Eighties, voting for anything remotely recent, putting all their votes in one contemporary pot, fed up with the thick, quirky weight of the past that's in their ears and eyes and way. So in the middle of this polite grown-up overview, a jumpy little rave of protest. (In a few years time, if this exercise is repeated - although I hope we'll be post-nostalgic by then - I suppose Spiller will sink down into the low nineties like Black Box. Or Boney M.) Then you remember that after the Beatles, Stones and the Kinks, very few of the important pop phenomena ever had No 1s: no No 1s for the likes of Dylan, Sly Stone, The Who, Marley, Sex Pistols, Smiths, Stone Roses, Nirvana, REM, Eric B and Rakim, Massive Attack, Radiohead. So any list of No 1s is always going to be relatively lightweight, however hard we try to make it otherwise. Such a list can only really give a few loose clues about the lovely chaos of pop, and supply an erratic index of our weekly need for the solemn, the silly, the flashy and the kitsch.

Things get a bit livelier. You wish the chart had begun at 17 with 'I'm A Believer'. Then you could get properly upset about the Manics at No 4 rather than having to yet again muster tired outrage at 'Bohemian Rhapsody' being so high, or yet more alarm that people consider 'Everything I Do' a better song than 'Heart Of Glass' or 'Baby Love' when it is obviously as poor as 'Mull Of Kintyre'. (Lennon and McCartney top and tail the list and looking at the songs in between you get a sense of how pop succeeds and fails in trying to bust out of the Lennon and McCartney vice.) Note also the low position of the Stones' 'Satisfaction', which highlights that we live in a pro-Beatles anti-Stones era, which helps explain Blair, Westlife, Chris Evans and OK! magazine. We also live in a pro-Abba age, which helps explain Dale Winton, S Club 7 and Gail Porter. We remain as ever pro-Queen and pro-Police, which explains The Dome, Sir Paul McCartney and Sir Elton John. We appear to be anti-Elton, but I think the fact that we hate 'Candle in the Wind' is more a reflection of our embarrassment at how over the top we went at Diana's death, just as the hatred for Celine Dion reflects our embarrassment at falling for the big sinking ship. From 18 or 19 the list becomes a lovely mess, rather than a polite mess. The No 1 emerges as something somewhere between sweet novelty and grand dotty gesture.

Maggie May' into 'It's Not Unusual' suggests that Rod should be knighted before Tom.</p> <p>The way 'That'll Be The Day' pulls up to the bumper of 'Do You Really Want To Hurt Me ?' makes me laugh wildly, possibly at the absurdity of the whole project.

The research, which considered various combinations of loans and savings, found customers could be up to \u00a3337 a year better off by switching to IF.</p> <p>Chief executive Jim Spowart says: 'Best Buy tables are widely valued by consumers. However, they don't provide the full picture. Maybe it is time for regulation.'</p> <p>IF, a subsidiary of the Halifax, has developed the concept of 'connectivity'. The customer can include any combination of five products an IF account: a flexible mortgage, a personal loan, a credit card, a current account and a savings account.

      "bodyText": "The new telephone and internet bank Intelligent Finance says 'best buy' tables for mortgages and savings are giving consumers inadequate information. The bank, known as IF, says the tables are unfair to accounts such as its own, which aim to maximise earnings and reduce costs for customers by offsetting borrowings against savings. It claims they do not reflect the fact that 76 per cent of the UK population with two or more banking products would be better off moving their finances to IF than shopping for 'best buys'. To back this up, it compared the top products listed in leading newspapers' best buy tables - information provided by MoneyFacts, Blays Guide and London &amp; Country Mortgages - with its own products. The research, which considered various combinations of loans and savings, found customers could be up to \u00a3337 a year better off by switching to IF. Chief executive Jim Spowart says: 'Best Buy tables are widely valued by consumers. However, they don't provide the full picture. Maybe it is time for regulation.' IF, a subsidiary of the Halifax, has developed the concept of 'connectivity'. The customer can include any combination of five products an IF account: a flexible mortgage, a personal loan, a credit card, a current account and a savings account. These can be 'connected' to cut the interest paid on borrowings, or to increase the amount earned on savings. The balances in your current and savings accounts can be added together to produce a total which earns the maximum possible interest, ranging from an annual equivalent rate (AER) of 5 per cent on deposits of up to \u00a3999, to 6.25 per cent gross on savings of \u00a3100,000 or more. Alternatively, any borrowings through a mortgage, loan or credit card can be offset against your savings, thus cutting the interest you pay. For example if you have a \u00a360,000 mortgage and \u00a33,000 in your current account, your savings will be 'connected' to the mortgage, so you pay interest on only \u00a357,000. Better still, any offsetting can be made against your most expensive form of borrowing. If you have an IF mortgage (discounted to 5.3 per cent for six months) and a personal loan (10.5 per cent APR), you can connect your savings to the personal loan and pay less interest. The concept is not entirely new: First Active and Virgin One have offered integrated mortgage and current accounts for several years. But IF is the first to enable customers to keep their borrowings and savings in separate, identifiable 'pots' which earn, or charge, interest at different rates. The idea has proved convincing. Since its launch in late September, 50,000 IF accounts have been opened - more than one a minute - and it has approved more than \u00a3500,000,000 in mortgages. Spowart wants Best Buy information providers to introduce a table for integrated accounts, or to print a warning to readers that 'best buys' may not provide them with the best possible financial results. However, John Woods, chief executive of MoneyFacts, says: 'Best Buy charts can only compare like with like. It would be totally misleading for any chart to show IF savings rates at 10.8 per cent. Customers can only get this on all their savings with IF if they have credit card borrowings of at least the same amount. How many people would ever have this? 'For people with a lump sum to save, there are better rates available. IF's savings rate at \u00a35,000 is 5.65 per cent, while Abbey National is paying 7 per cent.' People with low savings but large borrowings are likely to do better with a separate mortgage and a long-term discounted rate. Although the IF account includes a flexible loan with 1.5 per cent off the standard variable rate of 6.8 per cent, this lasts only six months. Ray Boulger of independent financial adviser John Charcol says: 'People with mortgages in six figures will find they get better value by having separate mortgage and savings accounts. 'The exception is big hitters in the City earning large bonuses which are put into their IF account and drawn on throughout the year.' If you are not in the high bonus or high savings categories, Boulger says you may be better off with a mortgage whose discount lasts two or three years. For example, Britannia building society offers a 2.4 per cent discount from its standard variable rate of 7.64 per cent for two years on sums worth up to 75 per cent of a home's value. \u0095 For further information on IF call 0845 609 4343 or visit its website at www.if.com.",

He had been very ill, died and then was buried. It was the way he wanted it, I was told. No other information was available; the phone line to his home in Derbyshire was disconnected.</p> <p>As a child, I recall walking into Stamford Bridge football ground to the upper tiered seats and watching his beloved Newcastle United take on my team, Chelsea. It was a 1-1 draw and we both left happy and wandered back to his Hampstead flat. I was there for what is known now as a 'sleep-over'.</p> <p>Except mine was with my father, rather than a school pal. He had moved out of the family home and set up on his own, and I would travel down by train for Saturday night visits. That was about as normal as it ever was, and the best of him.</p> <p>Six months later, he arrived back at the family home unannounced and set up a camp-bed in the lounge. My horrified mother scooped up her brood and fled. We moved from place to place around the country for three months trying to avoid his grasp. My 11-year-old brain fought to make sense of his descending fragility.</p> <p>But now I recall the time the social workers asked me whether I wanted to live with my mother or father. I lied and said it made no difference, for fear he would find out I had betrayed him. I spent the rest of the day in bed shaking, scared of the chaos my words might bring. I recall the time he blocked my mother's car in to prevent her driving me away from school and demanded to know why I wouldn't come and live with him, before I ran away screaming. I recall the time he asked my younger sister to sit in his car 'for 10 minutes' and then drove her away. For ever. I recall the time while still living in the family home, he went to live in the attic. He placed a lock and thick chain on the door to stop anyone prying and began his search for Catholicism. He was not a happy man and he found life harder than many. None of it was rational, but the accepting mind of a child absorbs and justifies it all. It was normal to me.</p> <p>In my twenties, we became estranged. I felt I had tried, but failed, to attain the relationship I wanted. I had repeated the 'I've only got one father' mantra often enough to know actions are needed to back those words. And I felt a little freer. If I'm honest, I changed my surname and refused to invite him to my wedding, partly to spite him. I wanted to teach him a lesson for ignoring me, for being obsessed with his own self. What sort of father are you? I demanded to know. Not the sort I want, I boldly claimed.</p> <p>Yet after his death that mantra came back to haunt me. Why else did I cry into my hands and sit transfixed by his photograph? How could he make me feel this way - for God's sake, I didn't even like him - but I think, despite myself, I loved the man he should have been, the man I wanted him to be.</p> <p>A few months later, my son was born; he made me cry as well. A perfect little sod. Innocent, happy, a new start. My overwhelming sense of love for my newly born child felt at odds with my father-and-son feelings. The experience of fatherhood made it difficult to reconcile how relationships change, how the love between man and boy can become a destructive force.</p> <p>Then I felt an almost irrational need to find out what happened to my father, a need to complete the circle, make sense of him and his attitude to me, to see where he lay.</p> <p>So I engineered a family holiday in Derbyshire, where, one snowy day, with my son in tow I headed for Buxton cemetery to find his grave. I laboured up and down the rows pushing a buggy, trying to find what remained of his memory. There were thousands of headstones. As I walked up to the front row, his name jumped out and hit me. Proof of his existence and proof of his demise. It was real - he was dead. I don't know why I was surprised, but it was true, here was evidence that he lived. There I stood, pathetically looking at what remained of him, searching for the words that would make it all all right.</p> <p>Instead, I raged, denouncing him; I still didn't have a flower to leave. Touching the gold grating at the bottom of the headstone, I reached for a fern and placed it inside. Then I manoeuvred my son in front of his grave and took a photograph. It was as close as he would get to his grandfather.</p> <p>His black headstone was inscribed with just his name, date of birth and the date he died, a stark reminder of his life. And below, in lower case, were the Arabic words maata alshayikh. I had no idea what they meant. I suppose I had hoped in death there would be resolution, maybe a sign that said: 'Here lies a father that loved his son.'</p> <p>I drove round to his house, where my stepmother still lived. I parked outside, walked up the drive way, and then turned back. I didn't want her to influence how I felt - I wanted whatever I had to be mine.</p> <p>Nobody I asked knew what the inscription meant; even the internet failed me. So I called the local council, seeking clarification. I was told it was a chess reference. The best he could do was to make his final move a strategic and calculated one. But this time, he had been cornered. It read: 'The king is dead.' The last move of the game. Well, I guess sadly it is my move now, time to move on and time to let him go.</p> <p>He was my father. I would not be who I am without him. And without him, my daughter and son would not be. And for that I am so, so grateful. I cannot pretend to understand why he did what he did, or even start to unravel his complicated mind. I doubt he knew himself. Despite his Oxford degree, his Fleet Street job, he was flawed. Well, big deal, who isn't?</p> <p>Happy New Year, old fella, and may you rest in peace.</p>",

I recall the time he asked my younger sister to sit in his car 'for 10 minutes' and then drove her away. For ever. I recall the time while still living in the family home, he went to live in the attic. He placed a lock and thick chain on the door to stop anyone prying and began his search for Catholicism. He was not a happy man and he found life harder than many. None of it was rational, but the accepting mind of a child absorbs and justifies it all. It was normal to me. In my twenties, we became estranged. I felt I had tried, but failed, to attain the relationship I wanted. I had repeated the 'I've only got one father' mantra often enough to know actions are needed to back those words. And I felt a little freer. If I'm honest, I changed my surname and refused to invite him to my wedding, partly to spite him. I wanted to teach him a lesson for ignoring me, for being obsessed with his own self. What sort of father are you? I demanded to know. Not the sort I want, I boldly claimed. Yet after his death that mantra came back to haunt me. Why else did I cry into my hands and sit transfixed by his photograph? How could he make me feel this way - for God's sake, I didn't even like him - but I think, despite myself, I loved the man he should have been, the man I wanted him to be. A few months later, my son was born; he made me cry as well. A perfect little sod. Innocent, happy, a new start. My overwhelming sense of love for my newly born child felt at odds with my father-and-son feelings. The experience of fatherhood made it difficult to reconcile how relationships change, how the love between man and boy can become a destructive force. Then I felt an almost irrational need to find out what happened to my father, a need to complete the circle, make sense of him and his attitude to me, to see where he lay. So I engineered a family holiday in Derbyshire, where, one snowy day, with my son in tow I headed for Buxton cemetery to find his grave. I laboured up and down the rows pushing a buggy, trying to find what remained of his memory. There were thousands of headstones. As I walked up to the front row, his name jumped out and hit me. Proof of his existence and proof of his demise. It was real - he was dead. I don't know why I was surprised, but it was true, here was evidence that he lived. There I stood, pathetically looking at what remained of him, searching for the words that would make it all all right. Instead, I raged, denouncing him; I still didn't have a flower to leave. Touching the gold grating at the bottom of the headstone, I reached for a fern and placed it inside. Then I manoeuvred my son in front of his grave and took a photograph. It was as close as he would get to his grandfather. His black headstone was inscribed with just his name, date of birth and the date he died, a stark reminder of his life. And below, in lower case, were the Arabic words maata alshayikh. I had no idea what they meant. I suppose I had hoped in death there would be resolution, maybe a sign that said: 'Here lies a father that loved his son.' I drove round to his house, where my stepmother still lived. I parked outside, walked up the drive way, and then turned back. I didn't want her to influence how I felt - I wanted whatever I had to be mine. Nobody I asked knew what the inscription meant; even the internet failed me. So I called the local council, seeking clarification. I was told it was a chess reference. The best he could do was to make his final move a strategic and calculated one. But this time, he had been cornered. It read: 'The king is dead.' The last move of the game. Well, I guess sadly it is my move now, time to move on and time to let him go. He was my father. I would not be who I am without him. And without him, my daughter and son would not be. And for that I am so, so grateful. I cannot pretend to understand why he did what he did, or even start to unravel his complicated mind. I doubt he knew himself. Despite his Oxford degree, his Fleet Street job, he was flawed. Well, big deal, who isn't? Happy New Year, old fella, and may you rest in peace.",

      "body": "<b>Elaine Showalter</b> <p>Like thousands of other Americans, I had my own moment of personal contact with Bill Clinton, and caught at close range a few of the dazzling rays of intelligence, magnetism, and power that made him such a legend for eight years. My daughter was one of Clinton's foreign-policy speechwriters, and had wangled places for her parents at a taping of his weekly national radio broadcast. Held in the White House Map Room, the Friday afternoon taping was an opportunity for staff families, loyal constituents, and worthy citizens to get a little face time with the President, and to have their picture taken with him. </p> <p>Clinton's performance, at the end of a long, exhausting winter day of helicopter campaigning for Democratic candidates in local elections, was stunningly energetic. He did the broadcast in one take, and then answered questions - about Ramadan and the number of Moslems in Arkansas, about the way Roosevelt had used the Map Room in World War II - in fluent detail. He greeted members of the small audience - ranging from a military family to an elderly couple who baked his favourite Italian pastries, with effortless warmth and tact. In our photograph, he seems to have one arm around me, another arm around my husband, and a third around our daughter. I am beaming.</p> <p>This is the kind of story everyone who met Clinton tells. Love him or hate him, you couldn't dismiss, ignore, or resist his charisma and political skill. His personality seemed colossal, perhaps tragically flawed, even in the worst of times. Were we all seduced? I don't think so. The whole country already seems dimmer.</p> <p><b>Frederick Forsyth</b></p> <p>From the outset, I was never really impressed by William Jefferson Clinton. I met him once at Downing Street. He had the personal charm to knock birds out of trees, huge personal charisma; mesmeric to women. But I have long taken the view that, in matters of state, charm alone is not enough, not by a long chalk. Yakubu Gowon of Nigeria had great charm, but led his country into the brutal catastrophe of the Biafra war. There has to be more than being pleasant over cucumber sandwiches on the lawn.</p> <p>Franklin D. Roosevelt had all the same charm, but he really achieved things - the New Deal and steely leadership through World War II. Kennedy was as flawed as Clinton in matters sexual, but he was inspirational. Yet it was ugly, corrupt Johnson who sent the Federal Marshals into Mississippi and Arkansas, and really got the civil rights legislation on the statute book. The point of the President is that he must achieve, or inspire. An inspirer? Alas, no\u0085 On achievement, not a lot. Medicare failed early. The Sisyphean task of Middle East peace defeated him - no blame there. A depressingly messy Kosovo adventure after an even worse Somalian exploit left no laurels.</p> <p>So what was he really? Tall, handsome, clever, charismatic; but also shallow, mendacious, louche. Roosevelt left behind the world's first superpower; Truman victory in Korea; Eisenhower Nato; Kennedy the Peace Corps; Johnson the civil rights laws; Nixon peace with China; Reagan the defeat of the USSR; Bush senior victory in the Gulf. And Clinton? A nickname, Slick Willy.</p> <p><b>Tom Paulin</b> </p> <p>In recent times, Clinton has become a folk hero in Ireland, especially in the North where his unremitting commitment to the peace process has helped bring about the still-precarious Assembly. It was Clinton's decision to grant Gerry Adams a US entry visa in 1994, which began the long sequence of events and negotiations which brought about the Good Friday Agreement. Watching Clinton so evidently enjoying his recent Irish visit, I was reminded of those Ulster emigrants who formed the backbone of Washington's army. One of them, John Dunlap, printed the Declaration of Independence; several of them signed it. The spirit of those emigrants and that of the nineteenth-century emigrants who left after the Famine seemed present in Clinton's words about his mixed Catholic and Protestant ancestry. </p> <p>The chorus in The Cure at Troy, Seamus Heaney's 1990 translation of Sophocles' Philoctetes, says this:</p> <p>'History says, Don't hope<br> On this side of the grave<br> But then, once in a lifetime<br> The longed-for tidal wave <br> Of justice can rise up,<br> And hope and history rhyme.'</p> <p>The man from Hope read these lines and was inspired by them. He has, in turn, inspired many Irish politicians and citizens. James Joyce's list in Ulysses of great Irish heroes includes Wild Bill Hickcock. It should be expanded to include Bill Clinton. </p> <p><b>Senator Edward M. Kennedy</b></p> <p>I take special pride in the fact that President Kennedy was an early inspiration and example to President Clinton. Their remarkable meeting at an event in the White House Rose Garden in 1963 clearly strengthened the young high-school student's interest in a future career of helping others through public service. Like my brother, he prepared himself by studying our history and later travelling throughout the world. He too broadened himself and became familiar with the concerns of other nations and the lives lived in other cultures. I know that President Kennedy would be especially pleased that Bill Clinton loved Ireland too. His visit to Ireland in 1963 was one of the great highlights of my brother's presidency. I know it would have meant a great deal to my brother to see how successful and enormous an effort President Clinton has made to help heal the Irish nation.</p> <p><b>Edward Said</b></p> <p>Undoubtedly the 'smartest' President in recent years, Clinton has careened from one crisis to another, always watching out for himself, shifting over his eight years from moderate liberal to right-of-centre Democrat, further dismantling the structures designed to help, if not save, the disadvantaged, minorities, and the unsuccessful. </p> <p>His crime/welfare/terrorist and (failed) health schemes disgracefully abandoned relatively decent positions and gave them to the Right, propping up law-and-order fanatics, punitively increasing the prison population (now the largest in the world), even as he beefed up the military to astronomical levels. His overseas military adventures, particularly the bombing of Sudan and Yugoslavia, in addition to what he has continued to do to Iraq (more than 150 civilians killed by US bombing raids, 500 others maimed: this doesn't include the millions of children who died because of the sanctions, the ruined economy, etc), earn him title to the status of war criminal. </p> <p>As for his supposed commitment to Middle East peace, he has a large measure of responsibility for the further immiseration of the Palestinian people, particularly after the Oslo documents were signed. His latest ongoing attempt has been called a fast-food peace, but even that phrase underestimates the malevolent sloppiness of his unabashed, unreconstructed Zionism (no President more Zionist than Clinton, say the Israelis). And, oh yes, there was also Monica Lewinsky\u0085</p> <p><b>Joyce Carol Oates</b></p> <p>Clinton will be leaving a very ambiguous legacy in American history. He's a man with a true vision, and yet clearly personal flaws and accidents of history have compromised that vision. There are two things he's done that tend to be over looked. He's been instrumental in cutting back the of freedom of the smoker, and he's been very courageous in fighting the gun lobby, since it's a world that Clinton comes from. I'm not sure that private life should have any bearing on historic performance. After all, we don't know or care what George Washington's sex life was like. Politics should be judged solely on actions and it's a shame that he's lost his political effectiveness, because he was a very good President.</p> <p><b>Christopher Hitchens</b></p> <p>There are things over which a President 'presides', and there are things for which he is individually responsible. Our culture judges actions by reputation and not reputation by actions. Therefore, most 'legacy' talk is sheer piffle. If Clinton is to be judged by the circumstances of his rule, he can claim credit by association. If he is willing to accept such vague credit, then he cannot evade distinct and identifiable responsibility. We can say of Clinton that, among other things, he personally and directly:<br> 1. Supervised (with his friend Dick Morris) the circumvention of the laws governing political fundraising.<br> 2. Insisted on the greatest lenience for himself, and for the grave offenses of perjury and obstruction of justice, while vastly expanding the prison-state for non-violent minor offenders, extending mandatory sentencing and announcing himself (quite correctly) as 'the capital punishment President'.<br> 3. Vetoed the rescue of Rwanda and broke his electoral promises to Bosnia.<br> 4. Left national health care even worse than he found it, and abandoned patients to the mercy of the HMOs.<br> 5. Ended the guarantee of Federal support for children born into poverty, and thus repealed the centrepiece of the New Deal.<br> 6. Was plausibly accused of rape by a credible female witness named Juanita Broaddrick, and could not manage a denial.<br> 7. Bombed a factory in the Sudan, in a week when he hoped to look potent but innocent, and has not commented on the discovery that the factory made only pharmaceuticals,</p> <p><b>Jon Snow</b></p> <p>Presentationally, Bill Clinton is a US President to die for. The trouble is, far too many have. At times I found myself almost eulogistically drawn to him. Belfast, Lagos, Kampala, Harlem, in each stop a total connection with all the people present; each one, personally. For America, he stirred a new abroad. Witness his spellbinding visit to India last year; his great African 'safaris' - no President before him, not even disregarded Carter, or over-stated Kennedy, devoted so much presidential prestige to that continent. For us, no one can take away from his Northern Ireland, his personal achievement of so internationalising it that he literally embarrassed the small players, who had played so shockingly there, into seeing the pathos of their ways when viewed from so grand a stage. Trying to fix the Middle East is not new. But the eulogist in me still wants to hand it to him. Those withering flights and nights and deepening bags above his drained cheeks; that bloody camera lens that would not let the suspicion of genuine endeavour be overwhelmed by his search for history's bigger, better Clinton. </p> <p><b>Julie Burchill</b></p> <p>He was just a dirty old man.</p>",

Kennedy I take special pride in the fact that President Kennedy was an early inspiration and example to President Clinton. Their remarkable meeting at an event in the White House Rose Garden in 1963 clearly strengthened the young high-school student's interest in a future career of helping others through public service. Like my brother, he prepared himself by studying our history and later travelling throughout the world. He too broadened himself and became familiar with the concerns of other nations and the lives lived in other cultures. I know that President Kennedy would be especially pleased that Bill Clinton loved Ireland too. His visit to Ireland in 1963 was one of the great highlights of my brother's presidency. I know it would have meant a great deal to my brother to see how successful and enormous an effort President Clinton has made to help heal the Irish nation. Edward Said Undoubtedly the 'smartest' President in recent years, Clinton has careened from one crisis to another, always watching out for himself, shifting over his eight years from moderate liberal to right-of-centre Democrat, further dismantling the structures designed to help, if not save, the disadvantaged, minorities, and the unsuccessful. His crime/welfare/terrorist and (failed) health schemes disgracefully abandoned relatively decent positions and gave them to the Right, propping up law-and-order fanatics, punitively increasing the prison population (now the largest in the world), even as he beefed up the military to astronomical levels. His overseas military adventures, particularly the bombing of Sudan and Yugoslavia, in addition to what he has continued to do to Iraq (more than 150 civilians killed by US bombing raids, 500 others maimed: this doesn't include the millions of children who died because of the sanctions, the ruined economy, etc), earn him title to the status of war criminal. As for his supposed commitment to Middle East peace, he has a large measure of responsibility for the further immiseration of the Palestinian people, particularly after the Oslo documents were signed. His latest ongoing attempt has been called a fast-food peace, but even that phrase underestimates the malevolent sloppiness of his unabashed, unreconstructed Zionism (no President more Zionist than Clinton, say the Israelis). And, oh yes, there was also Monica Lewinsky\u0085 Joyce Carol Oates Clinton will be leaving a very ambiguous legacy in American history. He's a man with a true vision, and yet clearly personal flaws and accidents of history have compromised that vision. There are two things he's done that tend to be over looked. He's been instrumental in cutting back the of freedom of the smoker, and he's been very courageous in fighting the gun lobby, since it's a world that Clinton comes from. I'm not sure that private life should have any bearing on historic performance. After all, we don't know or care what George Washington's sex life was like. Politics should be judged solely on actions and it's a shame that he's lost his political effectiveness, because he was a very good President. Christopher Hitchens There are things over which a President 'presides', and there are things for which he is individually responsible. Our culture judges actions by reputation and not reputation by actions. Therefore, most 'legacy' talk is sheer piffle. If Clinton is to be judged by the circumstances of his rule, he can claim credit by association. If he is willing to accept such vague credit, then he cannot evade distinct and identifiable responsibility. We can say of Clinton that, among other things, he personally and directly: 1. Supervised (with his friend Dick Morris) the circumvention of the laws governing political fundraising. 2. Insisted on the greatest lenience for himself, and for the grave offenses of perjury and obstruction of justice, while vastly expanding the prison-state for non-violent minor offenders, extending mandatory sentencing and announcing himself (quite correctly) as 'the capital punishment President'. 3. Vetoed the rescue of Rwanda and broke his electoral promises to Bosnia. 4. Left national health care even worse than he found it, and abandoned patients to the mercy of the HMOs. 5. Ended the guarantee of Federal support for children born into poverty, and thus repealed the centrepiece of the New Deal. 6. Was plausibly accused of rape by a credible female witness named Juanita Broaddrick, and could not manage a denial. 7. Bombed a factory in the Sudan, in a week when he hoped to look potent but innocent, and has not commented on the discovery that the factory made only pharmaceuticals, Jon Snow Presentationally, Bill Clinton is a US President to die for. The trouble is, far too many have. At times I found myself almost eulogistically drawn to him. Belfast, Lagos, Kampala, Harlem, in each stop a total connection with all the people present; each one, personally. For America, he stirred a new abroad. Witness his spellbinding visit to India last year; his great African 'safaris' - no President before him, not even disregarded Carter, or over-stated Kennedy, devoted so much presidential prestige to that continent. For us, no one can take away from his Northern Ireland, his personal achievement of so internationalising it that he literally embarrassed the small players, who had played so shockingly there, into seeing the pathos of their ways when viewed from so grand a stage. Trying to fix the Middle East is not new. But the eulogist in me still wants to hand it to him. Those withering flights and nights and deepening bags above his drained cheeks; that bloody camera lens that would not let the suspicion of genuine endeavour be overwhelmed by his search for history's bigger, better Clinton.

      "body": "<p>People are missing Bill Clinton already. Especially his closest allies and his sworn enemies, those who love him and who love to hate him.</p> <p>As Clinton's successor prepares to assume office under a pall of illegitimacy, the departing President, who could so easily have become a humiliated lame duck, remains the dominant political figure not only in America but across the world. The latest news that Clinton is, after all, to set up court not in New York but in Washington can only mean one thing: that the end of his final term of office will create a presidency-in-exile, and that this is farewell but not goodbye to the man they once called the Comeback Kid. President Zeitgeist, whose time is not yet past. There is a story about Clinton's idol, Franklin Roosevelt: he used to travel with aides who could remember almost everyone he met on his rounds and who, upon a re-encounter, would whisper in the boss's ear: 'Name's Jack; wife Sally. You played chess with him once.'</p> <p>'Hey Jack!' Roosevelt would say, to the amazed delight of those within earshot. 'How's Sally? We must play chess again sometime.' The difference between Roosevelt and Clinton is this: Clinton doesn't need the shadow. He can remember Jack and Sally by himself. Everyone who meets him (or most, at any rate) thinks Clinton is their special friend.</p> <p>'And,' says his one-time aide Paul Begala, 'the funny thing is that it's totally sincere. For that moment he looks into your eyes, Bill Clinton really loves you, just for that nanosecond.' In a patrician way, of course, but that is the stuff of great leaders, statesmen and monarchs down the centuries. George Bush says he 'trusts the people'; Clinton just adores them; he is an incorrigible flirt, not only with women but with America.</p> <p>He was and remains the master of the tactile, ancient art of politics. Sometimes, of late, this passion for the people became whimsical, even melancholy. More conscious than most presidents of his historical 'legacy', he nevertheless made a remarkable speech last year which concluded that 'in 200 years' time, no one will remember who we are'.</p> <p>There was an occasion in Little Rock about the same time; it was almost sad. Only yards from the podium on which he had bathed in the triumphal victory of 1992, Clinton had been addressing a crowd of senior citizens. The audience had for the most part disappeared into the night and the band was packing up. And there he was, working the rope line down to the last handshake, basking in the last drop of adulation.</p> <p>But very few of Clinton's subjects are above this kind of flattery - it turns us all into teenyboppers. Almost everyone that flocks to eat at Joe's Restaurant in downtown Little Rock agrees with schoolteacher Patsy Wright that 'Bill Clinton knows me better than I know him'. It is famously the case that women who do not generally feel these things go a little weak at the knees when their gaze meets Clinton's. </p> <p>Those who worked close to Clinton define his presidency differently. The departee George Stephanopoulos sees two years of offence followed by six years of defence. Loyalists like Rahm Emanuel, who replaced Stephanopoulos, and Sidney Blumenthal see a resurrection of the legacy of America's finest - Andrew Jackson and Roosevelt, in tune with a new political tonality across the democratic world. David Gergen sees a dual presidency between a husband and wife who 'came to Washington to do good things' but which 'I wish had turned out differently'. Dick Morris, sometimes called the President's 'Rasputin', sees a dichotomy between an ebullient public figure and a mysterious, solitary man, a man visibly wounded by his exclusion from Al Gore's election campaign.</p> <p>It was at the conclusion of that period of apparent melancholy, however, that Clinton burst forth with a speech at the Democrat convention in Los Angeles last summer. Many called this litany of self-assertion one of the great political speeches of our time, and not a few believed that it had been delivered by one of the great statesmen of the epoch, and one of America's great presidents. Certainly, it reaffirmed once and for all that there is such a thing as Clintonism and that Clintonism remains a major force, if not the major force, not only in America but in the world.</p> <p>Much is being written about Clinton's achievements, and rightly so. America is not the same country as he inherited. In 1992, the United States was in limbo, an interim period in Ronald Reagan's shadow presided over by the ancien r\u00e9gime of George Bush, economically and politically unsure of itself. Clinton now bequeaths to Bush Junior a buoyant nation basking in the most economically prosperous epoch in its history. Poverty remains a scourge, but the war against it has been declared. The stubborn steadiness of the growth rate has been staggering, wages and the standard of living are high, labour is more powerful than it has been for decades. Health care, although a disgrace by the standards of European welfare sates, has moved closer, despite the American traditions, to a system which protects the majority of citizens. Clinton's welfare reform was bitterly criticised by the Left, but unemployment rolls are low - America is busy working.</p> <p>Internationally, Clinton has become synonymous with the new global commercial order; he is, perhaps above all, the advocate of economic diplomacy, the President of Trade. He presided over the years of liberal democracy's unsteady conquest of the communist East. With others, he devised and became the figurehead for a new politics, the Third Way, a political hegemony to which not only Messrs Blair, Jospin, Schr\u00f6der and D'Alema subscribe, but also the leaderships in Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic - and even Israel and Russia in their fashion.</p> <p>Clinton's record is one of intervention in the world and its crises. In Bosnia - true - he was protean and infuriating. Each catchpenny gesture of resolve played hard on the hopes and fears of those under siege in Sarajevo - 'KLINTON TRAZI NOVI PLAN' (Clinton Tries a New Plan) - was a ghastly and familiar headline. But Clinton did halt the genocide in Kosovo. More than anyone, he did try to forge peace in Ireland and to make the end of war a realisable dream in the Middle East. He ended Uncle Sam's image as oppressor and adviser to fascists and torturers in the Latin hemisphere; he removed the dictator Cedras from Haiti; he courted communist China and in his last days built bridges to Hanoi and Pyongyang.</p> <p>Set against all this, there is the one thing everyone will remember about the Clinton years: that this is the President of the United States who was grilled for four televised hours about which part of his penis Monica Lewinsky did or did not touch. This is the President who engineered the handshake between Yasser Arafat and Yitzak Shamir on the South Lawn, but about whom a prosecutors' tome was compiled detailing 'oral-anal contact' in the Oval Office.</p> <p>What is really interesting about Clinton is not what he did but how he did it. Harold Ickes, a loyal but rebuffed confidant who has since become a propeller behind Hillary, once told me: 'Bill Clinton does so much more for his enemies than he does for his friends.' Ickes's is a good point and one which defines at least one face of Clinton's presidency.</p> <p>Clinton-hatred is special, qualitatively different from most political antagonism. For many on America's Conservative Right, Clinton's presidency - for all his popularity (and ironically, given the way Bush Junior was elected) - was in some way illegitimate. He was an upstart, a draft-dodger, a man who brought 'un-American' values to the White House.</p> <p>Working among these people, who detonated the impeachment crisis, in Arkansas, Washington and across America, it became clear that there was indeed, as Hillary said, a 'vast, right-wing conspiracy' to depose the President. After failing to achieve this through the paltry Whitewater scandal, it just happened to mobilise around the President's one Achilles' heel, a lusty droit de seigneur that has been customary among political leaders for centuries.</p> <p>Most interesting were the reasons for this hatred. In down-home, hoe-down Arkansas, Clinton was a cocky rebel; clever, ambitious, at ease with blacks. Toni Morrison even called him America's first African-American President. He played the saxophone and no one believed that he hadn't inhaled. He and Hillary brought people into the White House - such as Blumenthal, Begala, Stephanopoulos, the ragin' Cajun James Carville, Laura Quinn and so on - who were just as amazed to find themselves at work at the heart of power as the ancien r\u00e9gime was appalled. Clinton populated the State Department and embassies across the world, hitherto associated with the Cold War and Reagan diplomacy, with young and dynamic diplomats under the directorship of Madeline Albright and young James Rubin. Clinton and his era wove a new US presidency with a texture that the incoming old guard will now unravel, as it returns to the faded, jaded colours of 1992.</p> <p>But at the same time, Clinton dazzled the global power-brokers: the IMF, the World Bank and the wizard of capitalism, Alan Greenspan, with his grasp of political and economic realities. Clinton is an insatiable listener, obsessed with the fine-tuning of policy. The professionals of politics, diplomacy and economy were almost exhausted by his need to explore every nook and cranny, to hear every view before forming his own.</p> <p>In two weeks, Clinton becomes the youngest ever ex-President, but this is a man too young and restless to retire. There have been innumerable speculations about what he will do next. The easy, affectionate version predicts a good life of sex, prestige lectures and videotape. But there is a more serious plan afoot, a high-risk scheme that could have a major and original impact on world politics, discussed with The Observer over the past few weeks, that emanates from among the inner circle at the White House which has no intention of putting eight years' work into mothballs.</p> <p>The fundamental notion is this: that whatever the constitutional strictures that prevented him from running again, and whatever the election 'result' that puts Bush in the White House, Clinton is a man of his time. That time is the end of the Cold War; the decade in which his presidency took over America from the ancien r\u00e9gime was that which also saw the shedding of other skins: Thatcher giving way to Blair in Britain, Chirac to Jospin in France, Kohl to Schr\u00f6der and Fischer in Germany, Andreotti to D'Alema in Italy, Yeltsin to Putin in Russia, Netinyahu to Barak in Israel - in short, the Third Way. It is the same current running midstream along the same river - it is the Zeitgeist, both generational and ideological.</p> <p>Everyone knows that Al Gore fitted into this nexus like a round peg into a round hole. He must have envisaged himself at those G8 summit meetings, and the vision deprived must torture him. Everyone also knows that George W. Bush is a square peg in that round hole. Bush himself says he wants to take America back to the year that his father lost office. The programme of Clinton and his close entourage, as explained to The Observer, rests on the natural political affinity between Europe and the Clinton court in Georgetown on the Western edges of Washington DC, rather than Bush's White House.</p> <p>The presidency-in-exile has, or is making, contacts with allies at home in the United States, in Europe and Russia. In the US, the foundations are being laid for a Democrat siege of Capitol Hill in the elections of 2002, and a presidential candidacy in 2004 by Hillary Clinton, Al Gore or both. Overseas, there is intensive chatter between the outgoing White House and people for whom a Bush administration is both temporary and politically anomalous - with friends in Tony Blair's New Labour, Jospin's Socialists and Schr\u00f6der's Social Democrats.</p> <p>For all their formal diplomatic obligations, it will be hard for any of these parties to flourish in a 'special relationship' with George Bush while the Jacobite President Clinton and his busy entourage are wheeling, dealing and frequent-flying across the Atlantic. There is no doubt that a hesitant, isolationist Bush could fall under the shadow of a busy, globetrotting Clinton. This year's Third Way conference in Stockholm, at the conclusion of social democratic Sweden's chairmanship of the European Union, is intended to be a coming-out party for the shadow Atlantic Alliance.</p> <p>Bill Clinton, of course, will have no official title, except for that which those who are weaving this plot give him: 'World President of the Third Way'. Or perhaps more appropriately, as one close aide prefers: 'President of the World'. Even if that title fails to convince the entire planet, one thing is for certain: this is no time to bid a final goodbye to the Comeback Kid.</p>",

More conscious than most presidents of his historical 'legacy', he nevertheless made a remarkable speech last year which concluded that 'in 200 years' time, no one will remember who we are'. There was an occasion in Little Rock about the same time; it was almost sad. Only yards from the podium on which he had bathed in the triumphal victory of 1992, Clinton had been addressing a crowd of senior citizens. The audience had for the most part disappeared into the night and the band was packing up. And there he was, working the rope line down to the last handshake, basking in the last drop of adulation. But very few of Clinton's subjects are above this kind of flattery - it turns us all into teenyboppers. Almost everyone that flocks to eat at Joe's Restaurant in downtown Little Rock agrees with schoolteacher Patsy Wright that 'Bill Clinton knows me better than I know him'. It is famously the case that women who do not generally feel these things go a little weak at the knees when their gaze meets Clinton's. Those who worked close to Clinton define his presidency differently. The departee George Stephanopoulos sees two years of offence followed by six years of defence. Loyalists like Rahm Emanuel, who replaced Stephanopoulos, and Sidney Blumenthal see a resurrection of the legacy of America's finest - Andrew Jackson and Roosevelt, in tune with a new political tonality across the democratic world. David Gergen sees a dual presidency between a husband and wife who 'came to Washington to do good things' but which 'I wish had turned out differently'. Dick Morris, sometimes called the President's 'Rasputin', sees a dichotomy between an ebullient public figure and a mysterious, solitary man, a man visibly wounded by his exclusion from Al Gore's election campaign. It was at the conclusion of that period of apparent melancholy, however, that Clinton burst forth with a speech at the Democrat convention in Los Angeles last summer. Many called this litany of self-assertion one of the great political speeches of our time, and not a few believed that it had been delivered by one of the great statesmen of the epoch, and one of America's great presidents. Certainly, it reaffirmed once and for all that there is such a thing as Clintonism and that Clintonism remains a major force, if not the major force, not only in America but in the world. Much is being written about Clinton's achievements, and rightly so. America is not the same country as he inherited. In 1992, the United States was in limbo, an interim period in Ronald Reagan's shadow presided over by the ancien r\u00e9gime of George Bush, economically and politically unsure of itself. Clinton now bequeaths to Bush Junior a buoyant nation basking in the most economically prosperous epoch in its history. Poverty remains a scourge, but the war against it has been declared. The stubborn steadiness of the growth rate has been staggering, wages and the standard of living are high, labour is more powerful than it has been for decades. Health care, although a disgrace by the standards of European welfare sates, has moved closer, despite the American traditions, to a system which protects the majority of citizens. Clinton's welfare reform was bitterly criticised by the Left, but unemployment rolls are low - America is busy working. Internationally, Clinton has become synonymous with the new global commercial order; he is, perhaps above all, the advocate of economic diplomacy, the President of Trade. He presided over the years of liberal democracy's unsteady conquest of the communist East. With others, he devised and became the figurehead for a new politics, the Third Way, a political hegemony to which not only Messrs Blair, Jospin, Schr\u00f6der and D'Alema subscribe, but also the leaderships in Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic - and even Israel and Russia in their fashion. Clinton's record is one of intervention in the world and its crises. In Bosnia - true - he was protean and infuriating. Each catchpenny gesture of resolve played hard on the hopes and fears of those under siege in Sarajevo - 'KLINTON TRAZI NOVI PLAN' (Clinton Tries a New Plan) - was a ghastly and familiar headline. But Clinton did halt the genocide in Kosovo. More than anyone, he did try to forge peace in Ireland and to make the end of war a realisable dream in the Middle East. He ended Uncle Sam's image as oppressor and adviser to fascists and torturers in the Latin hemisphere; he removed the dictator Cedras from Haiti; he courted communist China and in his last days built bridges to Hanoi and Pyongyang. Set against all this, there is the one thing everyone will remember about the Clinton years: that this is the President of the United States who was grilled for four televised hours about which part of his penis Monica Lewinsky did or did not touch. This is the President who engineered the handshake between Yasser Arafat and Yitzak Shamir on the South Lawn, but about whom a prosecutors' tome was compiled detailing 'oral-anal contact' in the Oval Office. What is really interesting about Clinton is not what he did but how he did it. Harold Ickes, a loyal but rebuffed confidant who has since become a propeller behind Hillary, once told me: 'Bill Clinton does so much more for his enemies than he does for his friends.' Ickes's is a good point and one which defines at least one face of Clinton's presidency. Clinton-hatred is special, qualitatively different from most political antagonism. For many on America's Conservative Right, Clinton's presidency - for all his popularity (and ironically, given the way Bush Junior was elected) - was in some way illegitimate. He was an upstart, a draft-dodger, a man who brought 'un-American' values to the White House. Working among these people, who detonated the impeachment crisis, in Arkansas, Washington and across America, it became clear that there was indeed, as Hillary said, a 'vast, right-wing conspiracy' to depose the President. After failing to achieve this through the paltry Whitewater scandal, it just happened to mobilise around the President's one Achilles' heel, a lusty droit de seigneur that has been customary among political leaders for centuries. Most interesting were the reasons for this hatred. In down-home, hoe-down Arkansas, Clinton was a cocky rebel; clever, ambitious, at ease with blacks. Toni Morrison even called him America's first African-American President. He played the saxophone and no one believed that he hadn't inhaled. He and Hillary brought people into the White House - such as Blumenthal, Begala, Stephanopoulos, the ragin' Cajun James Carville, Laura Quinn and so on - who were just as amazed to find themselves at work at the heart of power as the ancien r\u00e9gime was appalled. Clinton populated the State Department and embassies across the world, hitherto associated with the Cold War and Reagan diplomacy, with young and dynamic diplomats under the directorship of Madeline Albright and young James Rubin. Clinton and his era wove a new US presidency with a texture that the incoming old guard will now unravel, as it returns to the faded, jaded colours of 1992. But at the same time, Clinton dazzled the global power-brokers: the IMF, the World Bank and the wizard of capitalism, Alan Greenspan, with his grasp of political and economic realities. Clinton is an insatiable listener, obsessed with the fine-tuning of policy. The professionals of politics, diplomacy and economy were almost exhausted by his need to explore every nook and cranny, to hear every view before forming his own. In two weeks, Clinton becomes the youngest ever ex-President, but this is a man too young and restless to retire. There have been innumerable speculations about what he will do next. The easy, affectionate version predicts a good life of sex, prestige lectures and videotape. But there is a more serious plan afoot, a high-risk scheme that could have a major and original impact on world politics, discussed with The Observer over the past few weeks, that emanates from among the inner circle at the White House which has no intention of putting eight years' work into mothballs. The fundamental notion is this: that whatever the constitutional strictures that prevented him from running again, and whatever the election 'result' that puts Bush in the White House, Clinton is a man of his time. That time is the end of the Cold War; the decade in which his presidency took over America from the ancien r\u00e9gime was that which also saw the shedding of other skins: Thatcher giving way to Blair in Britain, Chirac to Jospin in France, Kohl to Schr\u00f6der and Fischer in Germany, Andreotti to D'Alema in Italy, Yeltsin to Putin in Russia, Netinyahu to Barak in Israel - in short, the Third Way. It is the same current running midstream along the same river - it is the Zeitgeist, both generational and ideological. Everyone knows that Al Gore fitted into this nexus like a round peg into a round hole. He must have envisaged himself at those G8 summit meetings, and the vision deprived must torture him. Everyone also knows that George W. Bush is a square peg in that round hole. Bush himself says he wants to take America back to the year that his father lost office. The programme of Clinton and his close entourage, as explained to The Observer, rests on the natural political affinity between Europe and the Clinton court in Georgetown on the Western edges of Washington DC, rather than Bush's White House. The presidency-in-exile has, or is making, contacts with allies at home in the United States, in Europe and Russia. In the US, the foundations are being laid for a Democrat siege of Capitol Hill in the elections of 2002, and a presidential candidacy in 2004 by Hillary Clinton, Al Gore or both. Overseas, there is intensive chatter between the outgoing White House and people for whom a Bush administration is both temporary and politically anomalous - with friends in Tony Blair's New Labour, Jospin's Socialists and Schr\u00f6der's Social Democrats. For all their formal diplomatic obligations, it will be hard for any of these parties to flourish in a 'special relationship' with George Bush while the Jacobite President Clinton and his busy entourage are wheeling, dealing and frequent-flying across the Atlantic. There is no doubt that a hesitant, isolationist Bush could fall under the shadow of a busy, globetrotting Clinton. This year's Third Way conference in Stockholm, at the conclusion of social democratic Sweden's chairmanship of the European Union, is intended to be a coming-out party for the shadow Atlantic Alliance. Bill Clinton, of course, will have no official title, except for that which those who are weaving this plot give him: 'World President of the Third Way'. Or perhaps more appropriately, as one close aide prefers: 'President of the World'. Even if that title fails to convince the entire planet, one thing is for certain: this is no time to bid a final goodbye to the Comeback Kid.",

Cable &amp; Wireless, however, is different. For a start, it has cash in the bank - the balance should reach \u00a37 billion by the time its disposal programme is completed. That will give it the firepower to snap up some bargains when the inevitable fall-out in the market starts. Investors may also find some of that cash coming to them through a buy-back.</p> <p>For my second share, I have decided on a very cheap retail stock which seems to have good growth prospects: MFI, the furniture seller. I have been sceptical about the company in the past but there are signs that the new management team is finally making a profitable business out of the group's 30 per cent share of the kitchens and bedrooms market.</p> <p><strong>Jamie Doward</strong></p> <p>Investors in Winchester Entertainment enjoyed a fantastic 2000. The company's share price opened the year a fraction over the 200p mark to finish at 311p as the City warmed to it. Winchester is moving into the potentially lucrative area of media-rights ownership, in addition to producing its own films and children's television programmes. The company, which made the low-budget film Shooting Fish, has signed up for a number of worldwide distribution rights including a back catalogue of classics such as Raging Bull.</p> <p>One company that will be glad to see the back of 2000 is software firm Cedar Group, whose clients include the Post Office and German technology giant Siemens. Cedar's share price collapsed in October after a broker questioned its accounting. But management has delivered on forecasts up to now. A confident, forward-looking statement on interim results saw software licensing sales up by 175 per cent.</p> <p><strong>Paul Farrelly</strong></p> <p>Anyone who has watched the meteoric recovery of Abbey National is entitled to ask: what about Halifax? The difference, of course, is that Abbey caved into City pressure for a merger and now finds itself under siege. Halifax, however, has stayed resolute in ploughing its own furrow. Halifax would arguably be a better deal for Lloyds TSB, Barclays, Bank of Scotland or any other would-be Abbey suitor. And once Abbey goes, expect the spotlight to shine next on Britain's biggest mortgage lender, whose shares are still a relative bargain at 673p.</p> <p>LloydsTSB has shown it is serious over Abbey and - if regulators allow a deal to pass - I believe it will beat Bank of Scotland. So far the shares have side-tracked because of the amount of equity involved. That does, however, provide a cushion if LloydsTSB fails. In any event, the markets have been savage in down-grading LloydsTSB. But acquisition machines always run out of steam and the City scribblers always overreact. At 749p, LloydsTSB looks good on fundamentals for future deals. </p> <p><strong>Nick Mathiason</strong></p> <p>Property was one of the best-performing sectors in 2000. Picking bargains this year is harder since so many property companies went private in 2000. But Delancey Estates stands out. Last year, its share performance was flat. This won't be good enough for the company's biggest investor, George Soros. It is rumoured that Soros has agreed to back Delancey chief executive Jamie Ritblat if the company goes private. But there is a slim chance Delancey will still be in its current corporate state this time next year. The company has sold a number of shopping centres to reduce debt and to concentrate on the burgeoning central London property market. It has also secured a lucrative property outsourcing contract for Abbey National. Other contracts should follow.</p> <p>Late last year, the housebuilder and construction outfit Alfred McAlpine rejected a 235p offer from Gerald Ronson as a dramatic undervaluation. Lower interest rates, one of the main drivers for housebuilders, are on the cards. This, plus the prospect of increased public spending, should drive McAlpine's construction arm. Consolidation in this sector is in the air, following the recent merger between Beazer and Bryant. A new bid for McAlpine would have to come at a premium to its current 232p.</p> <p><strong>Oliver Morgan</strong></p> <p>2000 was the year of the scientist, with the mapping of the human genome completed in the summer. But the prognosis for biotechnology companies remains mixed. City experts point to Andover-based Shire Pharmaceuticals as an undervalued opportunity. It boosted its product portfolio and pipeline through a $4 billion merger with BioChem Pharma of the US in December. Development deals with big pharmaceuticals companies leading to royalty payments have given it earnings sooner than other biotechs, and analysts are pencilling in \u00a3160 million of pre-tax profits for 2001 - most competitors are years off earnings. We could see the share graph moving from today's 1,085p up to 1,500p.</p> <p>Few companies benefit from declining borrowing costs more than housebuilders, themselves receiving a boost in the last quarter of the year with healthy demand, high margins and little evidence of a bust in house prices - outside the South East at least. Among those that may have been left behind is Persimmon. With margins of more than 15 per cent outperforming its competitors, average selling prices rising through focus on more expensive homes and a well managed land bank, experts believe the foundations are there for a solid 2001. Pre-tax profits are expected to come in about 20 per cent up.</p> <p><strong>Joanna Walters</strong></p> <p>Aerospace giant BAE Systems is having a rough time at the moment. But if you look beyond the spring the prospects are brighter - and the stock is underpriced. The company's core defence business is in something of a lull between the retiring Tornado warhorse and the Eurofighter. But Salomon Smith Barney thinks pre-tax profits this year could approach \u00a3700m, and from 2002 onwards 'things look much better'.</p> <p><strong>The experts' view</strong></p> <p>This year's selection of share tips from our panel of fund managers and stockbrokers is a mixed bag, ranging from a tiny engineer worth less than \u00a365 million to the world's biggest drug company and from a traditional contractor to the manufacturer of components for mobile phones.</p> <p>First off is David Manning of Foreign &amp; Colonial who opts for the smallest company in the expert's portfolio. Firth Rixson supplies specialist forgings and castings to the aerospace industry - Rolls-Royce is one of the biggest customers with its Trent 500 engine. Manning predicts that profits will rise by a third over the next two years, putting it on a lowly price-earnings multiple of less than six, and a yield of more than 10 per cent. That limits the risk but gives 'significant upside potential'.</p> <p>Amanda Forsyth at Standard Life chooses British Airways, believing it will be a key player in the consolidation of the industry. Although the airline's shares are expensive compared to those of its rivals, she believes that is justified by its competitive advantage in the North Atlantic routes in particular. She expects fuel costs to fall, giving its profits a boost.</p> <p>The winner in 1999, Andrew Spence of Chase Fleming, is hoping to repeat that success with the selection of Spirent, formerly Bowthorpe. The acquisition of Hekimian late last year propelled it into the global league of suppliers of network testing systems, a market which is expected to grow rapidly.</p> <p>The fourth selection, from last year's winner John Hatherly of M&amp;G, is also a technology stock. He has plumped for Filtronic which, he says, has 'a fantastic position in mobile infrastructure' and stands on a prospective p/e of under 10 times for 2003 if all goes to plan. There are risks - its financial position is stretched and it may not manage to implement its strategy - but the potential rewards are high.</p> <p>Max Ward, who has started his own Independent Investment Trust following his retirement from Baillie Gifford, plumps for furniture retailer DFS. Ward is 'hugely impressed' at the way it has turned itself round after a period of difficulty four years ago. Now, sales are 'extraordinarily good' and, although opening costs will dampen profits this year, 12 months out the prospects are excellent. The shares are on just 11 times current year's expected earnings and the yield is more than 5 per cent, which he believes is 'too cheap for a quality business'.</p> <p>The biggest company in the portfolio is the choice of Jim Wood Smith of broker Grieg Middleton: GlaxoSmithKline. He says the merger between Glaxo and SmithKline, which has finally been given the go-ahead in the US, will give opportunities for significant cost-savings, underpinning earnings growth for the forseeable future.</p> <p>Richard Burns of Baillie Gifford thinks the oil price will stay above $25 a barrel, prompting him to pick Enterprise Oil. He believes Enterprise has some interesting oil reserves and, based on its cashflow, the shares look cheap. If his oil price prediction is right that will be corrected either through a rise in the shares - or it will be bid for.</p> <p>The final share in the portfolio is the choice of Scottish Value Management's Colin McLean: Amey. It is gradually moving away from basic contracting work into higher added-value infrastructure and private finance projects. If this is an election year, there could be an increase in spending on road, rail and other public-sector projects. The switch away from commodity work is also reducing the cyclical nature of Amey's earnings.</p>",

'Wannabe' by the Spice Girls is the most hated single, closely followed by Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On' from the movie Titani . Elton John's song, 'Candle in the Wind', which he performed in memory of Princess Diana at her funeral, is the third most hated single, followed by Chris De Burgh's 'Lady in Red' and Britney Spears's 'Baby One More Time'.</p> <p>More than 50,000 Observer readers and Channel 4 viewers took part in the poll.</p> <p>The top 10 after 'Imagine' and 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is: 'Hey Jude' by the Beatles, Abba's 'Dancing Queen', 'Every Breath You Take' by the Police, Ben E King's 'Stand by Me', 'The Drugs Don't Work' by the Verve, 'Don't Look Back in Anger' by Oasis, 'Groove Jet (If This Ain't Love)' by Spiller and Bryan Adams's '(Everything I Do) I Do It For You'.</p> <p>Robbie Williams, Madonna, Michael Jackson, David Bowie, George Michael and the Rolling Stones all failed to make it into the top 10.</p> <p>'Imagine' was first released in 1975.

      "bodyText": "'Imagine', by John Lennon, is the greatest number one single of all time, according to an Observer poll of the 100 best number ones. Lennon, beat Queen with 'Bohemian Rhapsody', the Beatles and Abba to top The Observer's poll of the best singles of the last 50 years. While the 70s classics topped the survey, readers who voted for their favourite songs in a joint competition with Channel 4 gave a thumbs down to pop artists of the 1990s. 'Wannabe' by the Spice Girls is the most hated single, closely followed by Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On' from the movie Titani . Elton John's song, 'Candle in the Wind', which he performed in memory of Princess Diana at her funeral, is the third most hated single, followed by Chris De Burgh's 'Lady in Red' and Britney Spears's 'Baby One More Time'. More than 50,000 Observer readers and Channel 4 viewers took part in the poll. The top 10 after 'Imagine' and 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is: 'Hey Jude' by the Beatles, Abba's 'Dancing Queen', 'Every Breath You Take' by the Police, Ben E King's 'Stand by Me', 'The Drugs Don't Work' by the Verve, 'Don't Look Back in Anger' by Oasis, 'Groove Jet (If This Ain't Love)' by Spiller and Bryan Adams's '(Everything I Do) I Do It For You'. Robbie Williams, Madonna, Michael Jackson, David Bowie, George Michael and the Rolling Stones all failed to make it into the top 10. 'Imagine' was first released in 1975. It reached number six and spent 11 weeks in the chart. After Lennon's death in 1980, it was re-released and spent four weeks at number one in December that year. In December 1988, it was released a third time and was in the charts for five weeks. It was re-released a fourth time as a Millennium single in 1999 and reached number three but was beaten to the Millennium number one by the Irish boy band Westlife. Of the song, John Lennon said: 'It's the one I like best.' The Observer /Channel 4 chart features standard heavyweights including Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, The Who, Bob Marley, The Sex Pistols and Marvyn Gaye. Sixties and Seventies icons, indluding Gloria Gaynor, the Beach Boys, Simon and Garfunkel and The Jam also feature. Newer artists include the Smiths, Stone Roses, Nirvana, REM and Radiohead. Writing in The Observer Review today, Paul Morley, who helped compile the shortlist of songs, says: 'The chart gives us a history of pop. This list - stupid, strange, dull, freaky and exhilirating - shows up the No 1 as an eccentric thing that's related to the history of pop but sometimes only distantly.' john.arlidge@observer.co.uk",

      "bodyText": "American military bases and consular facilities across Italy were placed on high alert against a possible terrorist attack last night, after reports that the US and Italian intelligence agencies had been warned of a threatened attack by Islamic militants linked to Osama bin Laden. The claims follow Friday's abrupt closure of the US embassy and heightened security at US air bases, and on civilian flights to and from the Middle East. Although US officials last night, sought to play down the threat - concerned that there might be a connection between it and the last-ditch peace efforts between Israel and the Palestinians sponsored by President Clinton - the Italian media reported that all flights between Rome and the US and Rome and the Middle East were being subjected to heavy security at Leonardo da Vinci airport. Although a source at the airport refused to discuss the new measures in detail, an Italian news agency said that luggage checks and controls at US and Middle Eastern airlines had been increased. 'All I can say is that a message was picked up that there may be a risk situation,' a US State Department source told The Observer yesterday. The official would not rule out reports that the threat was linked to Bin Laden's group, thought to be responsible for the devastating bombings of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. That was the 'likely' reason for the embassy closing early, said the official. An Italian Defence Ministry source said yesterday that US officials had contacted the Italian authorities on Friday morning, saying that there was 'a discomfort that some unwelcome development had been picked up by intelligence services'. Italian intelligence had also reportedly received 'information of a problem' but would not elaborate. President Clinton has warned - and intelligence reports predicted - that the first weeks of the new year could leave the US vulnerable to terrorist attacks overseas, and specifically from Bin Laden and his allies. Italy has long been regarded as a European 'soft underbelly' for attacks on American interests.",

      "bodyText": "The Good Friday Agreement is under threat because of the British government's resistance to nationalist demands for a Bloody Sunday-style inquiry into collusion between loyalist terrorists and an undercover Army unit. John Hume's SDLP says it will not support a reformed Northern Ireland police service unless there are public inquiries into the murders of solicitors Pat Finucane and Rosemary Nelson and the disputed death of Robert Hamill in Portadown. But the Government fears that a public inquiry into the military's Force Research Unit would endanger informants, including 'Steak Knife', the Army's most important mole inside the IRA. The security forces are concerned that a highly publicised probe into the FRU and the RUC Special Branch's relationship with the Ulster Defence Association in north and west Belfast would lead to the 'outing' of key informants and reveal the extent of collusion. Finucane, a nationalist solicitor, was shot dead by the UDA in 1989. The UDA member who had him targeted was Brian Nelson, an agent for the FRU working inside the loyalist terrorist group. Nelson's FRU handlers knew of the plot to shoot Finucane but failed to thwart the assassination. Loyalist terrorists involved in the Finucane plot also had an IRA member under surveillance who, unknown to them, was 'Steak Knife', the Army's agent inside the Provisionals. Nelson learned of a plot to shoot the IRA member and was ordered by his Army handlers to persuade the UDA to shift their target from 'Steak Knife' to a west Belfast pensioner, Francisco Notarantonio, whom they then murdered. It is understood these loyalists now realise who 'Steak Knife' is, and are prepared to name him if they are used as scapegoats in a public inquiry into the Finucane killing. The demand for the inquiries, including one into the potentially devastating Finucane case, is one of the key elements in a 'shopping list' the SDLP wants to swap for its support for the new police service and the 19-member policing board. Given government resistance, it seems the SDLP is on a collision course with Downing Street. The party came under further pressure from the Government yesterday after reports that Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland Secretary, intends to put plans for recruitment to the new police force in cold storage unless the SDLP takes its seats on the policing board at the end of January.

Bush - were frustrated as crude prices plunged. Iraq resumed some exporting last month. However, it is unclear what Saddam will do next (exports have been halted again since 31 December) or whether an Iraqi cut will be in place when and if Opec decides on one later this month.</p> <p>More broadly, UK oil analyst Steven Turner points out: 'We all know it is much more difficult for Opec to manage cuts in output than rises, because individual countries do not want to cut their revenues.' </p> <p>Lower prices - if they do stay low this year - will impact on the slow-down scenarios being painted in Washington and London.</p> <p>Oswald expects a similar pattern to that of 1990-91, with lower prices feeding into a recovery next year. He says: 'Undoubtedly part of the reason for the $10 drop is that the market has taken a view that the world economy is slowing, and that the demand for oil will slow, therefore the price will fall. This is the next stage of the process, an automatic correction.' </p> <p>Others would argue that oil prices no longer determine recessions; rather, recessions determine oil prices.</p> <p>Economists do expect the oil price to provide some counterbalance if a US-led slowdown materialises later this year. In the UK, David Hillier of Barclays Capital says: 'For the first three quarters of the year, lower oil prices are going to push inflation down to closer to 2 per cent rather than the 2.5 per cent Government target.' </p> <p>Hillier has adjusted his oil-price forecast for 2001 from $28 to $22, which delivers a 0.2 per cent drop in inflation. This, he believes, will help offset the inflationary impact of what appears to be stubborn consumer demand on the high street - evidenced by strong Christmas trading. In this scenario, if recession comes, oil will not be a contributory factor, as it was during the 'stagflation' of the Seventies.</p> <p>The outlook is anything but clear. Paul Horsnell of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies says: 'The price will be difficult to predict over the coming year: I expect more volatility. The key problem is creaking infrastructure - when you are running refineries at 95 to 97 per cent capacity, there is little margin for error.'</p> <p>Further off, Oswald believes oil will continue to maintain its influence over the global economy. 'This is the first time in history that we have seen a doubling of the oil price without a war. That is a signal of long-term oil demand.'</p> <p>And for those who say the US and Western economies are no longer as oil-reliant as they were in the Seventies he says: 'You have to think about China. It has five times the population of the US, and at the moment has one-twenty-fifth of the vehicles. You don't need a PhD in economics to see that demand is going to soar.'</p>",

Paul Horsnell of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies says: 'The price will be difficult to predict over the coming year: I expect more volatility. The key problem is creaking infrastructure - when you are running refineries at 95 to 97 per cent capacity, there is little margin for error.' Further off, Oswald believes oil will continue to maintain its influence over the global economy. 'This is the first time in history that we have seen a doubling of the oil price without a war. That is a signal of long-term oil demand.' And for those who say the US and Western economies are no longer as oil-reliant as they were in the Seventies he says: 'You have to think about China. It has five times the population of the US, and at the moment has one-twenty-fifth of the vehicles. You don't need a PhD in economics to see that demand is going to soar.'",

      "body": "<p>Airbus's new idea is to get into shipping. Don't be puzzled. The European jetmaker has no plans to start welding tankers together for a life on the ocean wave.</p> <p>This is a watery solution to an air-transport problem. The wings for the new, double-deck A3XX aircraft are so enormous that the only way they could be delivered from its North Wales factory to the final assembly line in southern France is by sea and then river barge.</p> <p>Airbus has just passed two of the most important milestones in its 30-year existence.

      "bodyText": "Airbus's new idea is to get into shipping. Don't be puzzled. The European jetmaker has no plans to start welding tankers together for a life on the ocean wave. This is a watery solution to an air-transport problem. The wings for the new, double-deck A3XX aircraft are so enormous that the only way they could be delivered from its North Wales factory to the final assembly line in southern France is by sea and then river barge. Airbus has just passed two of the most important milestones in its 30-year existence. First, the Anglo-German-French-Spanish Airbus partners have decided to go-ahead with building A3XX at a cost of \u00a37 billion, after years of brandishing giant models, computer graphics and fables about the giant's potential to house flying squash courts and swimming pools. Now renamed the A380, the giant craft will, when it takes to the skies in 2006, leapfrog the Boeing 747 as the world's largest passenger aircraft, capable of seating between 550 and 900 people. The second milestone was the partners agreeing to abandon their loose consortium arrangement and turn Airbus into a single company, in which the UK's BAE Systems (formerly British Aerospace) will have a 20 per cent stake. The other 80 per cent will be held by European Aerospace, Defence and Space (EADS), the giant new company formed by the merger of the Continental partners, France's Aerospatiale Matra, Germany's DaimlerChrysler Aerospace and Spain's Casa. The birth of the single company should herald a new era of huge potential growth, efficiency and profitability - and frighten the life out of Airbus's US rival Boeing. But it has also raised the disturbing question of the long-term security of around 9,000 Airbus jobs in Britain. BAE Systems has the option from 2004 to sell its stake in Airbus to EADS. Some observers are asking whether, if it does so, Germany will snatch away Britain's world-class wingmaking capability, with the loss to the UK of highly skilled Airbus jobs at its Filton and Broughton factories in Bristol and North Wales and tens of thousands of additional subcontractor jobs. One UK aerospace source said: 'BAE Systems currently has a veto over all sorts of Airbus matters, such as the location of wing manufacturing. If it sells its stake in the new, single Airbus company, what are the obligations of the Germans and French to maintain employment and plants in the UK?'

DaimlerChrysler has strong military aircraft capability and a history of involvement in plane making - with defunct Fokker of the Netherlands and German regional jet brand Dornier - all of which give it aspirations towards Airbus way beyond bashing fuselages into shape. 'If they could win some wing work, it would be the thin end of the wedge and they would try and get on a par with BAE product by product,' said the source. When Airbus developed the A320, Germany grasped the right to final assembly of this family of smaller jet from Aerospatiale of France and built its own facilities in Hamburg, desperate to be on a par with Toulouse. Said the source: 'It could be like a Trojan horse for Germany's ambition to dominate Airbus.' It is understood that DaimlerChrysler fought particularly hard to win rights to develop wings for the 'superjumbo' A380. This would have been a massive blow to Airbus UK and a bridgehead to assault Britain's wing-making domain. The threat was instrumental in persuading the Government to commit to \u00a3530 million in repayable launch aid for the A380 - even before the jet was given the official manufacturing go-ahead at Airbus and before the other partners' governments made their contributions. If BAE sold its stake in Airbus, and EADS tried to transfer wing work to Germany, the Department of Trade and Industry and its Secretary of State, Stephen Byers, would undoubtedly demand the instant return of the \u00a3530m.

Turner said the Government's unusually early commitment had seen off the 'real danger that another European country in Airbus could have made a big play for the wing of the A380'. The risk is not material unless BAE Systems exercises the option to sell its stake in Airbus. It says it has 'absolutely no intention' of leaving Airbus at a time when it is forecast to double in size, generating jet sales of $30bn a year in the next decade. But City analysts are not convinced. Nick Cunningham of Salomon Smith Barney, and Sandy Morris of ABN Amro, agreed that BAE was likely to sell out. Cunningham said: 'It is a good thing that Airbus is restructuring, but it is also a step on the way to disposal [of its Airbus interest] by BAE. Over the next few years there should be good profits from Airbus, but BAE is a defence company. Realising capital from its Airbus holding and putting it into the core defence business at the right time would be good.' However, the Government's position and strong industrial logic would see Britain continue to dominate wing-making for Airbus. Cunningham said: 'The UK would be very embarrassed if the jobs and the knowledge moved overseas.' When the contracts are signed for the A380 wings, that will be another 30 years' work in the bag for Airbus UK, on top of the last 30, that have seen it make every pair of wings on the 4,000 jets sold by the consortium to date. So it seems certain that the vision of 45 metre-long wings sailing majestically from Wales to France will be realised - heralding supremacy in the skies.

      "body": "<p>Karl Woolley, managing director of Tell-Tale Productions - which makes the Tweenies for the BBC - has been asked so many times to explain the success of the TV characters that he has a theory finely honed: 'They're just kids. The kids are just watching themselves. Some programmes feature a talking dog or something, but the kids love watching themselves.' </p> <p>But Georgia, 3, knows exactly why she and millions of other children her age like Tweenies Bella, Milo, Jake and Fizz. 'They're nice,' she says. 'What do you mean, nice?' her father asks. 'They're puddy,' comes Georgia's earnest reply.</p> <p>This may not seem a revealing answer, but it is. Georgia's mysterious faith in the merits of the fab four is a force to be reckoned with. Broadcasters love pre-school children more than any other demographic group, simply because these kids know what they want, and aren't fazed by peer-group pressure.</p> <p>'Pre-schoolers tend to be very honest,' says Katie Foster, director of consumer products at Hit Entertainment, the company behind the phenomenally successful Bob the Builder series on the BBC. 'They like things because they like them, rather than because friends tell them to like them. They're a lot less faddish, a lot more faithful. Playground currency is very dangerous. Look at Pok\u00e9mon. Hot one minute, then out of the window.' </p> <p>Children's television is now big news. So much so that the BBC is to launch two new digital television channels dedicated to children's programming later this year. It will spend \u00a3100 million (double its current budget) on new commissions.</p> <p>The seemingly inexorable rise of the industry is to some extent the result of an injection of talent. 'Only 10 years ago children's television was seen as the bottom of the business,' says Rupert Gavin, chief executive of BBC Worldwide, the commercial arm of the corporation. 'But now it's attracting the most creative producers in the country.'</p> <p>But it is also down to the fact that the companies behind the likes of Bella and Bob are now aware that successful kids TV characters are capable of generating multimillion-pound merchandising deals, some of which bring in more money than the firms would expect to make from broadcasting fees. </p> <p>Tweenies, for example, sold more than \u00a3100m worth of merchandise last year - beating the record set by the Teletubbies in its first year. In addition to notching up a number one single, Tweenies also swelled Auntie's coffers with a Christmas video and an educational CD-rom. Now the show's characters are on tour around the UK, playing to sell-out audiences. </p> <p>So delighted is the BBC with Tweenies that it has commissioned another 130 half-hour programmes to add to the 260 screened since March 1999. This is all good news for Aunty, which last year earned revenues of around \u00a380m from its children's division, of which 25 per cent came from merchandising sales. </p> <p>So seriously does the BBC take the potential of merchandising that it has built a factory in China dedicated to making toys based around its programmes. This means the BBC can ensure its products meet a certain standard and, at the same time, keep the entire merchandising cake to itself without having to sign-up costly third parties.</p> <p>But Tweenies' success is dwarfed by that of Thomas the Tank Engine - with around $500m worth of merchandise a year across 2,500 product ranges. The company that owns the Thomas name, Gullane Entertainment, has licensed the character to more than 500 companies, including toymakers Bandai and Hornby and food giant Heinz. Thomas even has his own theme park in Japan and last year hit the big screen in a feature film. More than 60 per cent of the revenues Thomas generates for Gullane come from merchandising deals.</p> <p>Hit Entertainment has already licensed the Bob the Builder brand for more than 500 products and, given the success of its Christmas number one single, more deals must be likely. Already more than 40 per cent of the revenues Bob generates for Hit come from licensing deals. </p> <p>'We'd like to claim we always knew it was going to be fantastic,' says Foster, 'but you can never expect it to be as fantastic as it turned out.'</p> <p>Bob is the most visible success of the UK licensing industry, which rough estimates suggest is worth nearly \u00a35 billion. About a third of this currently comes from character and entertainment merchandising - by far the biggest segment of the market. </p> <p>Parents may moan that they are condemned to years of pester power but the companies that own the rights to the characters argue that without licensing the programmes wouldn't get made. </p> <p>A half-hour of quality children's television costs \u00a3120,000-\u00a3350,000. In recent years the major broadcasters have started to agree to pay for part of the programmes up front to help offset swingeing start-up costs, but the producers argue that an increasingly discerning audience means they still have to find other income streams.</p> <p>'The shows are so bloody expensive to make that an alliance between the commercial and creative sides is a necessity,' says Angus Fletcher, head of UK TV for the Jim Henson Company, behind the Muppets, Fraggle Rock and, later this month on Channel 4, The Hoobs, a series about friendly aliens who land on Earth.</p> <p>Significantly, as broadcasters and production companies have woken up to the need to create credible, durable characters, capable of sustaining a plethora of licensing deals, they have moved to commission longer- running series to allow the programmes to become more established. Channel 4, for example, has commissioned more than 250 episodes of The Hoobs, the largest-ever pre-school commission to date.</p> <p>'You have to move away from short runs of programmes. There's much more potential if the characters are credible and believable, and this only comes over time,' Fletcher says. Several companies are prepared to trade fat broadcasting fees if their series get prime-time slots. 'The crucial thing is getting the best possible TV exposure for the character, says William Harris, chief executive of Gullane. We would accept a lower fee in return for better exposure. There are instances where people will give it away free.'</p> <p>But having the conviction to commission a large number of programmes is risky. 'No one has the patent on the magic formula,' says Gordon Welsh, spokesman for the Just Group, the company behind the revival of Pinky and Perky (coming soon to a channel near you) and the irreverent 3D animated series Butt-ugly Martians.</p> <p>For this reason commissioners increasingly want to be convinced that the series will have merchandising potential. But there is a fine line between maximising revenue and tarnishing the brand. </p> <p>'You need to keep the integrity of the character,' said Leysa Kay, a consultant for Brand Licensing London. 'It's not about being a prostitute to everyone who wants to sign a licence.' Hit, for instance, which has signed up around 60 licensees to make Bob the Builder products, turned down a similar number of interested firms because it didn't feel they were suitable for the brand.</p> <p>Hit's Foster says: 'The industry is a lot more sophisticated. In the past it was all about mugs and T-shirts. People thought they could just stick an image on something, whack it out to a retailer and make shedloads, but that's all changed. What you could get away with then you couldn't get away with now.' </p> <p>The quality of merchandising will become ever more pertinent with the release of the first Harry Potter films. Now that really could be a licence to print money.</p> <p> <strong>Thomas the wealth engine</strong> </p> <p>Thomas the Tank Engine is more than 50 years old, but the character created by the Reverend Wilbert Awdry for his books has found global fame only in the past decade or so.</p> <p>The Thomas television series wasn't an immediate success when it was exported from Britain to the US in 1989. US audiences didn't warm to the five-and-a-half minute episodes so Britt Allcroft, the company which owned the Thomas name, turned the show into half-hour formats.</p> <p>The company, which later changed its name to Gullane Entertainment and is currently valued at around \u00a3160 million, invested $16m in building the character's name and subsequently reaped the benefits when Thomas developed truly worldwide appeal. Today 75 per cent of revenues generated by Thomas come from outside the UK. In addition to Thomas, Gullane also owns the Captain Pugwash and Sooty characters.</p> <p>The show is currently seen in 120 countries around the world and the Thomas books have been translated into 19 languages. The Thomas the Tank Engine feature film was seen by more than 4 million cinema-goers while it is estimated that the character has sold more than \u00a32 billion worth of merchandising in the UK alone.</p> <p>Thomas is hugely popular in Japan, where he has his own theme park - Thomas Land. Consumers can even buy Thomas toilet paper and home furnishings.</p> <p> <strong>Tweenie dreams</strong></p> <p>Created for the BBC by Tell-Tale productions, whose team have in the past worked on the likes of Playschool and Playdays, the Tweenies are hailed as the new Teletubbies. </p> <p>The adventures of Bella, Milo, Jake and Fizz are now seen in 40 countries and have spawned numerous merchandising deals. The Tweenies became the first pre-school children's characters to release a pop album, Friends Forever, which brought in producers and songwriters who had worked with pop bands such as Steps.</p> <p>The album spawned a single which went to number one and spent eight weeks in the British Top 10.</p> <p>The programme is the fastest-selling property in the history of BBC Worldwide. In its first year, The Tweenies sold more than \u00a3110 million worth of products - outpacing even the Teletubbies, which has grossed more than \u00a31 billion in merchandising sales. </p> <p>A Christmas video and an educational CD-Rom were big sellers last year.</p> <p>Nearly 2 million Tweenies videos and books were sold by the end of October last year and the show's format has now been converted into a pop concert. </p> <p>Currently in the middle of a whirlwind 30-day tour, the Tweenies have sold more than 250,000 tickets - equal to Robbie Williams during his last tour.</p> <p><strong>Bob the empire builder</strong></p> <p>Owned by Hit Entertainment, which is valued on the stock market at more than \u00a3380 million, broadcasting rights to Bob the Builder have been sold in more than 100 countries. Hit has spent more than \u00a35m developing the Bob character.</p> <p>The show launches in the US next week - a crucial test if the character is to develop a global appeal. </p> <p>Around 500 Bob products are made under licence - including dolls, videos, cassette tapes, board games, puzzles and computer games. Big-name toy manufacturers signed up to make Bob products include Lego, Hasbro and Mattel.</p> <p>In addition, Bob's debut single, voiced by Men Behaving Badly star Neil Morrissey, knocked rap star Eminem off the festive number one slot and was the UK's best-selling single of last year. Not bad for a character who was launched only in April 1999. </p> <p>The show has made a millionaire of Bob's creator, Keith Chapman, a former advertising executive and cartoonist. In addition to Bob, Hit also owns other children's favourites such as Kipper, Percy the Park Keeper and Angelina Ballerina.</p>",

This means the BBC can ensure its products meet a certain standard and, at the same time, keep the entire merchandising cake to itself without having to sign-up costly third parties. But Tweenies' success is dwarfed by that of Thomas the Tank Engine - with around $500m worth of merchandise a year across 2,500 product ranges. The company that owns the Thomas name, Gullane Entertainment, has licensed the character to more than 500 companies, including toymakers Bandai and Hornby and food giant Heinz. Thomas even has his own theme park in Japan and last year hit the big screen in a feature film. More than 60 per cent of the revenues Thomas generates for Gullane come from merchandising deals. Hit Entertainment has already licensed the Bob the Builder brand for more than 500 products and, given the success of its Christmas number one single, more deals must be likely. Already more than 40 per cent of the revenues Bob generates for Hit come from licensing deals. 'We'd like to claim we always knew it was going to be fantastic,' says Foster, 'but you can never expect it to be as fantastic as it turned out.' Bob is the most visible success of the UK licensing industry, which rough estimates suggest is worth nearly \u00a35 billion. About a third of this currently comes from character and entertainment merchandising - by far the biggest segment of the market. Parents may moan that they are condemned to years of pester power but the companies that own the rights to the characters argue that without licensing the programmes wouldn't get made. A half-hour of quality children's television costs \u00a3120,000-\u00a3350,000. In recent years the major broadcasters have started to agree to pay for part of the programmes up front to help offset swingeing start-up costs, but the producers argue that an increasingly discerning audience means they still have to find other income streams. 'The shows are so bloody expensive to make that an alliance between the commercial and creative sides is a necessity,' says Angus Fletcher, head of UK TV for the Jim Henson Company, behind the Muppets, Fraggle Rock and, later this month on Channel 4, The Hoobs, a series about friendly aliens who land on Earth. Significantly, as broadcasters and production companies have woken up to the need to create credible, durable characters, capable of sustaining a plethora of licensing deals, they have moved to commission longer- running series to allow the programmes to become more established. Channel 4, for example, has commissioned more than 250 episodes of The Hoobs, the largest-ever pre-school commission to date. 'You have to move away from short runs of programmes. There's much more potential if the characters are credible and believable, and this only comes over time,' Fletcher says. Several companies are prepared to trade fat broadcasting fees if their series get prime-time slots. 'The crucial thing is getting the best possible TV exposure for the character, says William Harris, chief executive of Gullane. We would accept a lower fee in return for better exposure. There are instances where people will give it away free.' But having the conviction to commission a large number of programmes is risky. 'No one has the patent on the magic formula,' says Gordon Welsh, spokesman for the Just Group, the company behind the revival of Pinky and Perky (coming soon to a channel near you) and the irreverent 3D animated series Butt-ugly Martians. For this reason commissioners increasingly want to be convinced that the series will have merchandising potential. But there is a fine line between maximising revenue and tarnishing the brand. 'You need to keep the integrity of the character,' said Leysa Kay, a consultant for Brand Licensing London. 'It's not about being a prostitute to everyone who wants to sign a licence.' Hit, for instance, which has signed up around 60 licensees to make Bob the Builder products, turned down a similar number of interested firms because it didn't feel they were suitable for the brand. Hit's Foster says: 'The industry is a lot more sophisticated. In the past it was all about mugs and T-shirts. People thought they could just stick an image on something, whack it out to a retailer and make shedloads, but that's all changed. What you could get away with then you couldn't get away with now.' The quality of merchandising will become ever more pertinent with the release of the first Harry Potter films. Now that really could be a licence to print money. Thomas the wealth engine Thomas the Tank Engine is more than 50 years old, but the character created by the Reverend Wilbert Awdry for his books has found global fame only in the past decade or so. The Thomas television series wasn't an immediate success when it was exported from Britain to the US in 1989. US audiences didn't warm to the five-and-a-half minute episodes so Britt Allcroft, the company which owned the Thomas name, turned the show into half-hour formats. The company, which later changed its name to Gullane Entertainment and is currently valued at around \u00a3160 million, invested $16m in building the character's name and subsequently reaped the benefits when Thomas developed truly worldwide appeal. Today 75 per cent of revenues generated by Thomas come from outside the UK. In addition to Thomas, Gullane also owns the Captain Pugwash and Sooty characters. The show is currently seen in 120 countries around the world and the Thomas books have been translated into 19 languages. The Thomas the Tank Engine feature film was seen by more than 4 million cinema-goers while it is estimated that the character has sold more than \u00a32 billion worth of merchandising in the UK alone. Thomas is hugely popular in Japan, where he has his own theme park - Thomas Land. Consumers can even buy Thomas toilet paper and home furnishings. Tweenie dreams Created for the BBC by Tell-Tale productions, whose team have in the past worked on the likes of Playschool and Playdays, the Tweenies are hailed as the new Teletubbies. The adventures of Bella, Milo, Jake and Fizz are now seen in 40 countries and have spawned numerous merchandising deals. The Tweenies became the first pre-school children's characters to release a pop album, Friends Forever, which brought in producers and songwriters who had worked with pop bands such as Steps. The album spawned a single which went to number one and spent eight weeks in the British Top 10. The programme is the fastest-selling property in the history of BBC Worldwide. In its first year, The Tweenies sold more than \u00a3110 million worth of products - outpacing even the Teletubbies, which has grossed more than \u00a31 billion in merchandising sales. A Christmas video and an educational CD-Rom were big sellers last year. Nearly 2 million Tweenies videos and books were sold by the end of October last year and the show's format has now been converted into a pop concert. Currently in the middle of a whirlwind 30-day tour, the Tweenies have sold more than 250,000 tickets - equal to Robbie Williams during his last tour. Bob the empire builder Owned by Hit Entertainment, which is valued on the stock market at more than \u00a3380 million, broadcasting rights to Bob the Builder have been sold in more than 100 countries. Hit has spent more than \u00a35m developing the Bob character. The show launches in the US next week - a crucial test if the character is to develop a global appeal. Around 500 Bob products are made under licence - including dolls, videos, cassette tapes, board games, puzzles and computer games. Big-name toy manufacturers signed up to make Bob products include Lego, Hasbro and Mattel. In addition, Bob's debut single, voiced by Men Behaving Badly star Neil Morrissey, knocked rap star Eminem off the festive number one slot and was the UK's best-selling single of last year. Not bad for a character who was launched only in April 1999. The show has made a millionaire of Bob's creator, Keith Chapman, a former advertising executive and cartoonist. In addition to Bob, Hit also owns other children's favourites such as Kipper, Percy the Park Keeper and Angelina Ballerina.",

Foster's, based in south Australia, also has major wine operations, which interest new Diageo new chief executive Paul Walsh following its $8.2bn acquisition - with Pernod - of Seagram's spirits and wine business before Christmas. The revelation of a potential further shake-up in the world brewing industry follows the Government's dramatic blocking of a \u00a32.3bn takeover of Bass Brewers by Belgium's Interbrew last week. This weekend a stunned Interbrew - best known for its Stella Artois lager - is locked in meetings with its City lawyers over the controversial decision by Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers. Plans for a judicial review are expected to focus on the alternative option of selling the Whitbread Beer Company, which Interbrew also bought last year. 'By the middle of next week we will have a clearer view of the grounds for a legal challenge,' one Interbrew source said. Foster's is the UK's number two beer brand, with over \u00a31bn sales and 8.2 per cent of the market, behind Bass's Carling Black Label. In the UK and continental Europe it is brewed under licence by Scottish and Newcastle, the UK's number two brewer.

Indeed, if the casual viewer zapped cleverly enough and managed to avoid all those weeping members of Castaway, it was as if drip-dry fabrics had yet to be invented. Even the Castaways, when asked what they were most looking forward to on their return to civilisation, failed to mention logging onto the internet or popping out to Starbucks for a double-double decaff skinny latte - no, they just wanted a bath. Edited highlights of these (including 'Ben Fogle's First Nice Long Candlelit Soak Back Home in Notting Hill. PG: Includes stiff upper lip, occasional tears and black labrador'), will soon be available on BBC Video priced at \u00a39.99.</p> <p>The tightly-laced tone was set by Gentlemen's Relish, which had looked like a potentially feisty piece of drama in the trailers, but somehow contrived to make a little light pornography even duller than almost anything to be viewed late night on Channel 5. </p> <p>Billy Connolly as Swann, an unfashionable painter of classical nudes who turns to photography to kick-start his career, was quite improperly squandered thanks to a lumberingly unfunny script (not even Connolly can be expected to charm and twinkle his way through 90 minutes of alleged comedy without being given a character to play with); Sarah Lancashire, as his devoted housekeeper, fell back on a campy combination of wide eyes and pursed lips, as if Julie Andrews was playing Widow Twankey; while Douglas Henshall, as Swann's sleazy assistant whose dark-room manipulations turned the boss's works of art into under-the-counter sauce, was caught inexplicably impersonating Alfie-era Michael Caine.</p> <p>I suppose it was meant to be panto-farcical, but I had a bit of a humour bypass - all wide-eyes and pursed lips - because there was something slightly suspect about the amount of corpulent female flesh captured in close-up; a kind of retrograde humour that relied on the viewer colluding with the premise that skinny women's naked bodies are intrinsically, dangerously erotic (so we weren't allowed too many of those in close-up, thank you very much), while goosing fat women's wobbly bits is just so much prime-time snigger-worthy sauce for the ganders - 'Ooh! sir! What a great big BBC budget you've got!' 'Come and sit on m'knee, m'dear, and be sure to get your ratings out for the chaps...'</p> <p>Meanwhile BBC2's Scandalous Women, part of the channel's Victorian Week, had a more edifying angle on old-fashioned sexual mores, reminding us that sex wasn't invented in the naughty 1990s by Loaded magazine. As a Victorian married woman and therefore 'a legal non-person', Caroline Norton endured her husband (Tory MP) George Norton's regular beatings (perfectly legal to beat your wife, of course - as long as the stick was no thicker than your thumb) and bore him three sons, before sensibly embarking on an affair with the jolly nice (Whig Home Secretary) Lord Melbourne.</p> <p>After a messy courtroom battle, Caroline was denied access to her children for six years (George handed them over to the care of his mistress) and even when the youngest was fatally injured in a riding accident, Caroline was informed too late to make it to his bedside. However, her fight for custody ensured a change in the law, thus allowing divorced or separated women rights to both property and children for the first time. And aside from the fact that this legislation subsequently resulted in Sarah Lancashire's playing a simpering suffragette in Gentlemen's Relish, clearly more 'scandalous women' should make it on to the National Curriculum, while Caroline Norton should be at the very least a household name and ideally a national holiday, on 2 January.</p> <p>I was gripped by Channel 4's The 1900 House but revisiting the experiment, in The 1940s House, looked like a less engaging prospect. With electricity, a radio, plenty of lipstick and no Heath Robinsonesque underwear to grapple with every morning, how hard could life really get for the Hymers family, even with a bit of rationing? Happily, however, the Hymers turned out to be made of less robust stuff than their time-travelling predecessors, straightaway admitting to having eaten only convenience foods all their lives ('Our diet is appalling. Nutritionally we're at the bottom end of poor... we're Mr and Mrs Blobby, we're greedy, we drink...'), so now that the rationing has kicked in, their misery is palpable - and it's still only 1940.</p> <p>On hand to welcome them to their home, Marguerite Patten's expression of wide-eyed, yet politely restrained horror as Lynne Hymers admitted to never having baked a cake, was a treat. And despite Geoffrey Palmer's voiceover informing us that 'beauty will be expected as part of their wartime duty', Lynne and her daughter Kirsty are already looking a bit tonsorially lackadaisical, despite having arrived in the house with spiffy Trevor Sorbie marcel waves and a 'sixpenny singe'. In the real, twenty-first century world it is practically impossible to get an appointment with Trevor so, frankly, they should work harder at keeping up appearances while mincing their rissoles.</p> <p>Kirsty's two sons are sweet. 'Compared to what we have at home, the rizzles [sic] were really nice... and the blancmange was creamy and light - perfect! I like home-made meals' said 10-year-old Ben, wistfully. Still, that was before rationing, at which point the family resorted to a staple diet of jam sandwiches. 'War is really not a good game,' Ben conceded several days later, after a night in the Anderson shelter and a week without 'rizzles'. They'll regret giving those rabbits to the pet shop, mark my words.</p> <p>Not a Marceled hair out of place in Sword of Honour, Channel 4's delicious adaptation of the Waugh trilogy, effectively condensed into a two-parter by William Boyd. It would be a fine challenge to write a review of a televised Waugh without invoking Brideshead, but I'm not too proud to fail. Just as beautifully art-directed, sun-dappled and costumed as it's forerunner, but far more dramatically paced (if you've watched Brideshead recently, you'll have noted how it now looks languid to the point of comatose), Sword of Honour wore its predictable comparisons well.</p> <p>As our hero, Guy Crouchback, a man of boundless decency and infinite idealism, forced to fight his way through a cynical World Waugh 2, craggy Daniel Craig initially looked a little too lived-in to play quite such an emotional naif, though by the end Crouchback's character was perhaps sufficiently disillusioned to suit Craig's face. Around the central character, as every apparently noble action had comically dreadful repercussions, a wonderful cast (including Leslie Phillips, refreshingly cad-free and bounderless as Crouchback Sr and Megan Dodds as the wicked and wilful Virginia) made the potentially cartoonish actions of the blimpish, wimpish and vampish successfully navigate the line between black comedy and pathos. Sword of Honour will, I guess, have had far fewer viewers than Gentlemen's Relish, but deserved far more.</p> <p>Incidentally, last Thursday I found myself in the rather unlikely but entirely delightful position of being seated for supper between the RAF and the Navy on board HMS Illustrious, and can (I hope) safely report, on the record and without having signed the Official Secrets Act, that some very top brass from those Forces, not to mention the Army on the other side of the table, had all loved Sword of Honour - even though the Captain of Illustrious had opted to watch ITV's repeat of A Touch of Frost instead. I hope Channel 4 won't mind me sending my review tapes to save the Captain's wife the trouble of buying it on video - both of them, will, I'm sure, enjoy the numerous references to 'the bloody, bloody Navy...'</p> <p>Finally, I allowed myself to hurtle back into the twenty-first century with the new series of Frasier. At the end of the last we left Daphne and Niles in a recreational vehicle escaping both Daphne's impending nuptials to the hapless Donny and Niles's three-day-old marriage to the ghastly Mel. But five minutes later, Jane Leeves's Daphne is suddenly wearing baggy tops and attempting to hide what looks - unless she nervously OD'd on pre-wedding canapes - suspiciously like a pregnancy. This presumably unscheduled bump of a plot development should make the series worth watching even if, for the first time in the show's history, the writing felt a little bit flabby around its midriff, too.</p>",

I suppose it was meant to be panto-farcical, but I had a bit of a humour bypass - all wide-eyes and pursed lips - because there was something slightly suspect about the amount of corpulent female flesh captured in close-up; a kind of retrograde humour that relied on the viewer colluding with the premise that skinny women's naked bodies are intrinsically, dangerously erotic (so we weren't allowed too many of those in close-up, thank you very much), while goosing fat women's wobbly bits is just so much prime-time snigger-worthy sauce for the ganders - 'Ooh! sir! What a great big BBC budget you've got!' 'Come and sit on m'knee, m'dear, and be sure to get your ratings out for the chaps...' Meanwhile BBC2's Scandalous Women, part of the channel's Victorian Week, had a more edifying angle on old-fashioned sexual mores, reminding us that sex wasn't invented in the naughty 1990s by Loaded magazine. As a Victorian married woman and therefore 'a legal non-person', Caroline Norton endured her husband (Tory MP) George Norton's regular beatings (perfectly legal to beat your wife, of course - as long as the stick was no thicker than your thumb) and bore him three sons, before sensibly embarking on an affair with the jolly nice (Whig Home Secretary) Lord Melbourne. After a messy courtroom battle, Caroline was denied access to her children for six years (George handed them over to the care of his mistress) and even when the youngest was fatally injured in a riding accident, Caroline was informed too late to make it to his bedside. However, her fight for custody ensured a change in the law, thus allowing divorced or separated women rights to both property and children for the first time. And aside from the fact that this legislation subsequently resulted in Sarah Lancashire's playing a simpering suffragette in Gentlemen's Relish, clearly more 'scandalous women' should make it on to the National Curriculum, while Caroline Norton should be at the very least a household name and ideally a national holiday, on 2 January. I was gripped by Channel 4's The 1900 House but revisiting the experiment, in The 1940s House, looked like a less engaging prospect. With electricity, a radio, plenty of lipstick and no Heath Robinsonesque underwear to grapple with every morning, how hard could life really get for the Hymers family, even with a bit of rationing? Happily, however, the Hymers turned out to be made of less robust stuff than their time-travelling predecessors, straightaway admitting to having eaten only convenience foods all their lives ('Our diet is appalling. Nutritionally we're at the bottom end of poor... we're Mr and Mrs Blobby, we're greedy, we drink...'), so now that the rationing has kicked in, their misery is palpable - and it's still only 1940. On hand to welcome them to their home, Marguerite Patten's expression of wide-eyed, yet politely restrained horror as Lynne Hymers admitted to never having baked a cake, was a treat. And despite Geoffrey Palmer's voiceover informing us that 'beauty will be expected as part of their wartime duty', Lynne and her daughter Kirsty are already looking a bit tonsorially lackadaisical, despite having arrived in the house with spiffy Trevor Sorbie marcel waves and a 'sixpenny singe'. In the real, twenty-first century world it is practically impossible to get an appointment with Trevor so, frankly, they should work harder at keeping up appearances while mincing their rissoles. Kirsty's two sons are sweet. 'Compared to what we have at home, the rizzles [sic] were really nice... and the blancmange was creamy and light - perfect! I like home-made meals' said 10-year-old Ben, wistfully. Still, that was before rationing, at which point the family resorted to a staple diet of jam sandwiches. 'War is really not a good game,' Ben conceded several days later, after a night in the Anderson shelter and a week without 'rizzles'. They'll regret giving those rabbits to the pet shop, mark my words. Not a Marceled hair out of place in Sword of Honour, Channel 4's delicious adaptation of the Waugh trilogy, effectively condensed into a two-parter by William Boyd. It would be a fine challenge to write a review of a televised Waugh without invoking Brideshead, but I'm not too proud to fail. Just as beautifully art-directed, sun-dappled and costumed as it's forerunner, but far more dramatically paced (if you've watched Brideshead recently, you'll have noted how it now looks languid to the point of comatose), Sword of Honour wore its predictable comparisons well. As our hero, Guy Crouchback, a man of boundless decency and infinite idealism, forced to fight his way through a cynical World Waugh 2, craggy Daniel Craig initially looked a little too lived-in to play quite such an emotional naif, though by the end Crouchback's character was perhaps sufficiently disillusioned to suit Craig's face. Around the central character, as every apparently noble action had comically dreadful repercussions, a wonderful cast (including Leslie Phillips, refreshingly cad-free and bounderless as Crouchback Sr and Megan Dodds as the wicked and wilful Virginia) made the potentially cartoonish actions of the blimpish, wimpish and vampish successfully navigate the line between black comedy and pathos. Sword of Honour will, I guess, have had far fewer viewers than Gentlemen's Relish, but deserved far more. Incidentally, last Thursday I found myself in the rather unlikely but entirely delightful position of being seated for supper between the RAF and the Navy on board HMS Illustrious, and can (I hope) safely report, on the record and without having signed the Official Secrets Act, that some very top brass from those Forces, not to mention the Army on the other side of the table, had all loved Sword of Honour - even though the Captain of Illustrious had opted to watch ITV's repeat of A Touch of Frost instead. I hope Channel 4 won't mind me sending my review tapes to save the Captain's wife the trouble of buying it on video - both of them, will, I'm sure, enjoy the numerous references to 'the bloody, bloody Navy...' Finally, I allowed myself to hurtle back into the twenty-first century with the new series of Frasier. At the end of the last we left Daphne and Niles in a recreational vehicle escaping both Daphne's impending nuptials to the hapless Donny and Niles's three-day-old marriage to the ghastly Mel. But five minutes later, Jane Leeves's Daphne is suddenly wearing baggy tops and attempting to hide what looks - unless she nervously OD'd on pre-wedding canapes - suspiciously like a pregnancy. This presumably unscheduled bump of a plot development should make the series worth watching even if, for the first time in the show's history, the writing felt a little bit flabby around its midriff, too.",

Born in Taiwan of mainland Chinese parents, he studied film in the States and over the past decade has built up a coherent oeuvre while making films in a variety of genres on three continents, working as happily in English as in Chinese. </p> <p>He first made his mark in 1993 with The Wedding Banquet, a comedy about a young gay New York property dealer entering into a marriage of convenience to please his traditionalist Taiwanese parents. Lee then returned to Taiwan for Eat Drink Man Woman, about a celebrity cook and his rebellious children, before coming to England to direct Emma Thompson in Sense and Sensibility, the best of all Jane Austen adaptations. </p> <p>This was followed by The Ice Storm, a study in the Updike manner of middle-class New England exurban life in the morally confused early 1970s, and a superb western, Ride With the Devil, set during the American Civil War. Now he's turned to the most popular of all Oriental genres, the martial arts film, with the entrancing Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, made on location in China with leading Hong Kong actors.</p> <p>Lee's films share a stylistic sophistication, a narrative flow, a feeling for the big set-piece and a concern for language. But what binds these apparently diverse works together is the consistency with which he pursues certain key themes. These include the rewards and restrictions of family life, the necessity of breaking with relations and traditions to establish your own identity, and the deceptive nature of reality, which leads us into misreading the world around us.</p> <p>He brings a certain formality or reticence to the task and always locates the action in a precise society, usually one in a state of transition, whether it be Jane Austen's England or an America torn apart by the Civil War. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is set during the Qing Dynasty, a period in the early nineteenth century before the European commercial invasion that is regarded as something of a golden age. The title refers to an old Chinese proverb about people concealing their real identities - vulnerability in a strong man, assertiveness in a meek woman - and all the characters have hidden selves or suppressed desires. </p> <p>A complicated (at times confusing) plot turns on two pairs of lovers. The nationally celebrated warrior Li Mu Bai (handsome Chow Yun-Fat) cannot declare his love for Yu Shu Lien (the beautiful Michelle Yeoh), his female counterpart and fellow subscriber to the ancient chivalric code laid down in the manual of Wudan. A decade or more younger than this poised couple are another charismatic pair, Jen (Zhang Ziyi) and Lo (Chang Chen). Jen is the rebellious daughter of a noble family, Lo is a bandit leader living in a cave in the desert, and they've secretly become lovers. </p> <p>Jen, however, has been trained as a martial artist by Jade Fox, an evil villainess, who has taught her the Wudan system of combat, but not the ethical code that should accompany it. Jade Fox has murdered Li's spiritual master, and on her behalf Lo steals a fabulous 400-year-old sword called Green Destiny that belonged to Li and should only be wielded by an honourable warrior. This weapon, described as 'strong but supple - the way to rule', becomes a central matter of contention. </p> <p>The story is not without significance and the film has considerable moral power. There are parallels with our own Arthurian legend and various other mythic echoes, though it never becomes an eclectic confection like Star Wars. But what makes it an exciting kinetic experience in the cinema is the epic sweep, the contrast between the serene beauty of the settings and the astonishing action sequences.</p> <p>Preferring the marshal acts of lawmen with their feet on the ground in the West to the martial arts of athletes leaping around in the East, I've never been a devotee of kung-fu pictures. I like my karate in short, isolated bursts - Spencer Tracy taking on Ernest Borgnine in Bad Day at Black Rock, for instance, or Frank Sinatra engaging with Henry Silva in The Manchurian Candidate. Until now, the only martial arts picture I've really loved is King Hu's classic A Touch of Zen (1969), but the fights in Ang Lee's film are breathtaking in their beauty. </p> <p>These action sequences are choreographed by Yuen Wo Ping, who staged the chases and battles in Jackie Chan's Hong Kong flicks, and more recently worked in America on The Matrix. Though long drawn out, they never get tedious and each is quite different in character and contributes to the dramatic development. As in dreams, the combatants defy gravity, flying through the air, running up walls, quite literally floating like butterflies and stinging like bees.</p> <p>Four of these fights stand out. In the first, a masked Jen steals the Green Destiny sword and (resembling the young female cat burglar in Hitchcock's To Catch a Thief) is chased through the night over the rooftops of Beijing by the older woman, Yu. The two later have a graceful fight indoors for possession of the sword.</p> <p>In the film's last big fight, Jen fights in a forest of giant bamboo trees with the mature warrior, Yi, a scene with echoes of the climactic confrontation between the good and bad brothers who conduct a moral argument as they exchange gunfire in Anthony Mann's Winchester 73. But as they bounce from the top of one tree to another swinging their lethal swords, it seems as if we're looking at Nijinsky playing a combination of Tarzan and D'Artagnan. </p> <p>Jen has another scene, as cleverly staged as the others, but wonderfully comic, in which she takes on a succession of overweight braggarts in a country inn. They underestimate her martial skills as much as they overrate their own and they end up in tatters and the inn is demolished. It's a fight that would have won the admiration of John Ford. One mentions Ford, but his women stood by and watched as their men went into action. Few westerns have provided female roles like the ones so confidently played here by Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi, and it could be argued that no western has provided so persuasive a context. </p> <p>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is the first foreign language picture for many years to get a sizeable release in British cinemas, and the first ever to do so in a non-European language. One wishes Lee's film well because it deserves to be popular and if successful, it might encourage distributors and audiences in the direction of greater boldness.</p>",

The problem is, there aren't that many wee towers around. The idea of living in a castle had always seemed like a dream to Peter, even as a boy growing up in Berwickshire, where his father used to take him round old ruins.</p> <p>'I always wanted to restore a castle,' he says. 'I just never thought it would happen.' Of course not - it's what rich people do, people who have the estimated \u00a31.5m it takes to restore a castle ruin. But one Sunday afternoon 11 years ago, Peter and Lin visited the ruin of Ballencrieff Castle. They were on the east coast of Scotland, near Aberlady, and they had heard that the building, or what was left of it, was due to be demolished. Pictures taken at the time by Historic Scotland show piles of rubble lying within the crumbling ruin walls.</p> <p>Today, Ballencrieff is a gem, unexpected in its sheer scale as you pull up in the drive expecting a home of more humble proportions. One could easily get lost in its winding stone stairwells, snatching glimpses of the surrounding landscape from the windows inset within the deep stone walls, and wandering into rooms of an imposing grandeur we're quite unused to. Yet it's also a family home, with recipe books in the kitchen and photos scattered in the drawing room where Peter and Lin settle with the Sunday papers - informal signs of everyday life.</p> <p>As a civil engineer who has spent his life restoring properties, Peter saw the potential below the grime. 'The logistics of restoring the castle weren't huge,' he says, sounding surprisingly matter-of-fact. But the scale of the renovation was daunting, particularly when it came to financing the project. Although he received a grant from Historic Scotland, he settled the bulk of the bill on his own.</p> <p>'I had to fight the costs all the time,' Peter admits. 'We more or less stuck to the budget, which in itself was miraculous, but if you want a way to get rid of your money, buy a ruined castle.' It can, he says, feel like you're pouring money down the drain. Although Peter won't divulge the exact sums, he admits going \u00a350,000 over budget. Peter knows of people who've simply gone bankrupt, overwhelmed by the costs. He himself gave up his job for the final two years to oversee the restoration, living off Lin's salary as a schoolteacher, purely because they could then save on a contract manager's fee.</p> <p>Still, there were rewards, particularly when it came to piecing together the puzzle of a building that had lain empty since 1868, when fire ripped through the castle leaving only its walls standing. Although no one can precisely pinpoint its age, history shows Ballencrieff suffering its first baptism of fire in 1547 before being rebuilt in 1586, with changing fashions seeing the five-storey castle encased within a Georgian mansion in 1730, a style obliterated by the second fire 138 years later. For Peter, the challenge was to restore the 16th-century design without becoming sidetracked by clues unearthed from the 'jerry-built' Georgian version.</p> <p>'When they made this into a Georgian building, they removed all the medieval architecture. It simply went out of fashion,' he explains, and it's funny to consider that this would be the equivalent of us moving into a new pad and ripping out the Anaglypta wallpaper and 70s Hygena kitchen units. The Great Hall - a cavernous space at the top of the main sweeping stone staircase designed to strike awe into any humble peasant arriving to pay their rent - was oak panelled at one point, while the flagstones had been replaced by timber, all easy to deconstruct.</p> <p>But the real clues lay in the rubble, which Peter sifted through like a giant jigsaw. In the Great Hall, Peter reconstructed the intricate plasterwork ceiling with its heraldic symbols from fragments buried within 8ft of rubble. Some of the shattered symbols displayed the initials of Sir Gideon Murray, a previous owner who was also the deputy treasurer for Scotland between 1612 and 1621, while high on the wall he discovered a minstrel's gallery, once in stone and now recreated in timber.</p> <p>A section of ceiling found intact from where it had fallen during the fire prompted Peter to research the records of ceilings in Scotland, where he discovered an identical example in Kellie Castle in Fife. The moulds were later taken to Edinburgh Castle. Recently, when that castle was restored, Ballencrief in turn supplied samples for it.</p> <p>'We were constantly surprised by what we were finding. We know who lived here and what they looked like because their paintings hang in some of the national galleries. The domestic history was wonderful,' Peter says. 'Imagine all the tragedies that went on in this house. Sir Gideon Murray was the Baron in 1617. He could hang people on the gallows two fields away. In 1617 he declared three local men outlaws for stealing his apples. They could be shot on sight.'</p> <p>Clearly, it is details such as this that kept the project alive for Peter. It took seven years before they could leave their home in nearby Gullane and move into the top floor, while work continued on the levels below. While most people move into a space and then decipher what's needed and what will suit before splurging out on the Visa card, Peter and Lin spent years buying pieces from auctions and other castles, holding them in storage until the time was right. Larger items had to be lifted in through the roof.</p> <p>Peter recalls that first Christmas, which was far from the roasting-chestnuts-over-the-fire scenario the family might have wished for. Instead, it was spent huddling in the upper reaches of the castle without central heating or hot water. This Christmas, things were looking markedly different, with the family gathering in the Great Hall, coming and going as the day unfolded. Peter admits turning down a significant sum of money from a party from Hong Kong who had proposed hiring Ballencrieff for their New Year celebrations. Most people would have jumped at the chance, but, as Peter says, it's not a case of money being no object. It's just that family comes first, and if Christmas was to turn into nothing more than a money-making process, well, what's the point?</p> <p>The Hong Kong party would not have been disappointed. There are great touches: the four-poster in the master bedroom (an ideal honeymoon suite) was made using an old church-organ frame, while the pewter goblets in the dining room were found among the rubble. The doors throughout are traditionally made, just planks of wood roughly nailed together. There's a Hepplewhite chair which belonged to the late author Nigel Tranter, who visited Ballencrieff with the couple on that first Sunday and invited Peter to pick a piece from his own home as a house-warming gift. Peter chose the Hepplewhite because it came from Greystoke Castle in Cumberland. It seemed fitting. And in the top-floor living room, an easy, informal space, you'll find original graffiti on the plasterwork, proof that 16th-century kids could become bored little vandals, too.</p> <p>Would he do it again? Well, yes. Peter now sources castles for other people, and is currently restoring one in Fife for a client. He also lectures on castle restoration at Aberdeen University. Tranter calculated there were more than 7,000 castles in Scotland and Peter can see six ruins from his many windows. All you need is a spare million or so and one could be yours. In the meantime, as Peter says, 'We won't be leaving until we're too old to climb up and down these stairs!'</p>",

No need - grab a pair of wellies and visit the dark rhubarb sheds of West Yorkshire. Philippa Ventom, tourism manager for Wakefield District Council, found one visit sufficient to wipe away the cares of the world. Admittedly, she is somewhat biased, given that she organises such tours, but even tourist officers need to relax.</p> <p>Every year, from January until March, rhubarb grower Janet Oldroyd Hulme guides visitors around her warm forcing sheds. 'It's like entering a beautiful, secret world,' she says.

No need - grab a pair of wellies and visit the dark rhubarb sheds of West Yorkshire. Philippa Ventom, tourism manager for Wakefield District Council, found one visit sufficient to wipe away the cares of the world. Admittedly, she is somewhat biased, given that she organises such tours, but even tourist officers need to relax. Every year, from January until March, rhubarb grower Janet Oldroyd Hulme guides visitors around her warm forcing sheds. 'It's like entering a beautiful, secret world,' she says.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<b>The panel</b> <p><b>Maureen Freely</b> writes about relationships. She says her main qualification is that she's a veteran of many bad ones. 'I know what other people should avoid doing.'</p> <p><b>Euan Ferguson</b> is an Observer interviewer and commentator.</p> <p><b>Neasa Macerlean</b> is a personal finance expert and reporter for the Cash section of The Observer.</p> <p><b>Eileen Mulligan</b> is one of the UK's most successful and sought after life coaches. She is also the author of Life Coaching For Work (\u00a39.99, Piatkus).</p> <p><b>Pat Kane</b> is a social commentator and devised The Play Ethic, which he introduced in Life magazine and outlined during a series of lectures at the ICA. </p> <p><b>Wendy Moore</b> is an award-winning medical journalist, regular contributor to Life and editor of Channel 4's stress site (www.channel4.com/stress).</p> <p><b>Jane Clarke</b> is a state registered dietician and has a regular column in Life. She is also the author of the Bodyfood series of books (from \u00a312.99, Orion).</p> <p><b>Helen Foster</b> is a health and fitness journalist as well as the author of the forthcoming self-help book Dejunk Your Life (\u00a312.99, Time Life Books).</p> <p><b>Barefoot Doctor</b> teaches Taoism, meditation, Chinese medicine and t'ai chi and has a regular column in Life. He is also the author of several books including The Barefoot Doctor's Handbook for the Urban Warrior (\u00a38.99, Piatkus).</p> <p><b>Relationships</b> <br> Maureen Freely</p> <p><b> 1</b> Follow the example of Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, author of The Jewish Book of Adultery, who says that the best way to keep a stable relationship passionate is to build in periods of abstinence. Let both parties ache for it before they allow themselves to have it. </p> <p><b> 2</b> Try using what's called 'paradoxical problem solving'. For example, instead of going into counselling to express your sexual boredom, first try changing the position of your bed. This is not as silly as it sounds. With paradoxical problem solving, instead of seeking a logical or rational resolution to a domestic drama, all you do is rearrange the props and, without a single earnest discussion, break the deadlock. </p> <p><b> 3</b> Find out if someone is as interested in you as you are in them by doing the following: next time you meet for a drink, calculate the distance between your drink and theirs and then push your drink forward so it is twice as close. If the person flinches or moves the glass, you still have a lot of work to do. If he/she does not seem to mind, try pushing it a little closer, then a little closer still. If your glass meets with no resistance whatsoever, the chances are you won't either. </p> <p><b> 4</b> If pressed for time, try what relationship guru Laura Corn calls 'quickies'. If, for example, you like someone, just say so. If you want to meet for a coffee, or equally have sex on the kitchen floor, go for it, now. And don't worry if it's over almost before it begins. Ten minutes of intense pleasure are about all anyone can take in a 24-hour day. </p> <p><b> 5</b> Be warned by John Gottman - the world's most accurate expert on marital relations. In one study he was able to predict with 94 per cent accuracy which couples in his studies would divorce within three years. The earliest warning sign is frequent harsh personal criticism and it can be non-verbal as well as verbal. In Gottman's lab studies, wherever wives' faces registered disgust at their husbands' words four or five times in a 15-minute period, the couple were likely to separate within four years. </p> <p><b> 6</b> Avoid 'flooding'. This is when you're so upset you can't think, or when he/she seems not to hear a word you've said. This is not just in your head. It's an unpleasant physical state in which your heartbeat is about 10 beats a minute above your normal level, and adrenaline is racing through your bloodstream. Our friend Gottman has trained some couples to stop and count their pulse mid-argument. If they detect flooding, they then call a 20-minute time-out and retire to their separate corners to practise their favourite relaxation techniques. </p> <p><b> 7</b> Stick to the point. If you want to keep your rows from turning into plate-smashing ceremonies, Daniel Goleman, author of Emotional Intelligence, advises that you avoid throwing in the other thousand things that are driving you mad about a person. Thus, if the argument started out being about the red socks that got in with the whites by mistake and turned everything pink, it should still be about red socks and pink sheets when it comes to a close. When you are making a complaint, be specific - not just about the thing you don't like, but how you feel about it, and what you'd like to happen instead. </p> <p><b> 8</b> Try 'mirroring' - another technique relationship that experts recommend. What this means is that when your loved one complains about something you do, you throw away your standard defensive responses, eg: 'Yes, but', 'You can talk', and 'Have you ever heard the one about people who live in glass houses?' and instead listen carefully to the complaint, and then repeat it back to him/her, in his/her own words and ask if you have understood correctly. This technique keeps the temperature cool and the level of communication high. </p> <p> <b> 9</b> Remember that ratios count. According to Gottman, if the amount of time you spend arguing with your partner is only a seventh of the amount you spend together happily, your relationship is doing very well. If 60 per cent of your problems are unresolvable, you're normal, so don't worry. Instead, try building up goodwill by practising what the experts call validation. This means praising people for work well done, or generous gestures appreciated. </p> <p> <b> 10 </b> Don't underestimate the importance of time spent alone together and bear in mind that the harder it is to arrange, the more important it is to arrange it. How you spend that time is also crucial. Leave behind mundane domestic matters on these occasions and talk instead about the big things: your hopes, your dreams and your fears. And how about this? Instead of drawing up a list of personal New Year's resolutions, sit down together and think of three things you've never done, or never done together, that you'd like to do before the year is out. </p> <p> <b> 11 </b> Finally, if you feel you're putting a lot more into a relationship than the other person is, or if you're upset because you're ready to settle down into something more permanent and he/she very clearly isn't or you find yourself waking up in the middle of the night with worst-case scenario jealous fantasies, you could do worse than try the Ana\u00efs Nin Cure. That is, you take the same worst-case scenario but this time make yourself its main player; perfect happiness, according to Nin, means having not one, not two, but three lovers on the go. That way you're never bored, always busy, and have at least one person waiting in the wings who is just dying to give you a good time. </p> <p> <b>Culture</b><br>Euan Ferguson</p> <p> <b> 12 </b> Throw away your telly. A little drastic, certainly, but if you're going to spend one year of your life wholly freed from spoonfed dumbo cretin-babble it might as well be this one. Britons are rushing back to the cinema and you should join them, for there will be nothing good on television in the coming year. </p> <p> <b> 13 </b> Subscribe to McSweeney's, a quarterly American magazine of new writing due to be distributed in Britain next year, and one of the most savagely cool things to appear between hard covers. Edited as a labour of love by Dave Eggers, author of A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius, it switches format and price from issue to issue (the most recent was individual pamphlets presented in a box), is typographically stunning and is printed, naturally, in Iceland. </p> <p> <b> 14 </b> Log on to either <a href=\"http://www.tvgohome.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.tvgohome.com</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theonion.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.theonion.com</a>, two of the few genuinely funny things on the interwebnet. The first, a set of spoof TV listings, is more creative and entertaining than 99 per cent of the medium it parodies. </p> <p> <b> 15 </b> Buy five jazz albums and spend some time falling in love with smart music. You could do far worse, for a starter kit, than the following: Kind of Blue by Miles Davis, naturally, still the classic post-war jazz recording; A Love Supreme , the best collection around of John Coltrane; Elegiac Cycle by Brad Mehldau and Soul on Soul by Dave Douglas, the improvisers of the moment on, respectively, piano and trumpet; and Promenade with Duke by the late Michel Petrucciani, the world's formost Ellington interpreter. </p> <p> <b> 16 </b> Brush up on your Tolkien, even if you hate it. When the film comes out, no party will be safe from a Lord of the Rings conversation, so make sure you have something to say, even if it's simply, 'I never read it; and nor, happily, did I spent my entire teenage years making horrid cracking sounds with my knuckles and picking my sweaty feet and masturbating.' If you want to say something else, remember that the Elf language was based on Finnish, the Orc vernacular based on Turkish, that Tolkien (John Ronald Reuel) wrote half of it sitting in a tree and that the filming was interrupted last year when the New Zealand army, acting as paid extras, had to take off their goblin outfits to go and fight with the UN in East Timor. </p> <p> <b> 17 </b> Go to Colombia. Cartagena, on the Caribbean coast, features both a lovely old cobbled city and a new hedonistic overflow of clubs, casinos and beaches, and will be the destination of choice for those in the know. </p> <p> <b> 18 </b> Turn Japanese. Japan 2001, a year-long celebration of the country and its culture and trends and gadgets and wars, really kicks off in May with a spectacular Matsuri jamboree in Hyde Park - but you should try to get with the programme before tout London is dressing and dancing like Tokyo. If you want to escape all this, take a quick trip to Rotterdam, the year's joint European City of Culture with Oporto - a fine Breughel the Elder show begins at the renovated Boijmans Van Beuningen Museum on 27 May. </p> <p> <b> 19 </b> Become a Friend of Tate Modern, and win cultured access to the grooviest bar in London, the private riverside terrace on the fifth floor. But don't stay in the capital all the time: Walsall's New Art Gallery has already attracted more than 210,000 visitors in less than a year and features, along with the Picassos and Chagalls, lift announcements by Noddy Holder. </p> <p> <b> 20 </b> Join a poetry workshop. Key fact: make sure it's a good one, such as that run by Michael Donaghy at London City University, not a pony one attended by Lord of the Ring's aficionados and wet-lipped, recently divorced, failed marketing managers called Malcolm feeling sorry for themselves. Donaghy's, however, is not for the faint-hearted or emotionally dishonest; his deconstruction of your own work will help, but it will scare. </p> <p> <b> 21 </b> Go to Dulwich College in south London, before the end of February, to see the James Caird, the wooden boat in which Ernest Shackleton and an exhausted crew crossed 800 miles of open sea to South Georgia to secure rescue for the marooned men on his failed 1916 expedition, and the marvellous accompanying photographs of hell on ice. </p> <p> <b> 22 </b> Fly to New York to visit the stunning Rose Space Center and new Planetarium. Take in, on the way, a ruinously expensive but delightful cocktail at the Campbell Apartment, a splendidly restored chic hideaway beside Grand Central Station. </p> <p> <b> Money</b> <br>Neasa MacErlean</p> <p> <b> 23 </b> Don't see your parents as financial gurus. Even the big City regulator the Financial Services Authority is concerned that up to 40 per cent of people consult their parents, which is OK if you want views and recommendations from 20 years back, but not OK for now. </p> <p> <b> 24 </b> Start being entrepreneurial. A degree and a profession will pay the mortgage but won't give you the financial freedom that comes from running clever businesses, renting out property or owning other well-picked income-generating assets. </p> <p> <b> 25 </b> Get yourself computer-literate for free. The first one million people who apply can get a \u00a3150 subsidy for a training course through the government's Individual Learning Account scheme (0800 072 5678). </p> <p> <b> 26 </b> Work out what you will do with the money you save from switching mortgages. Cutting your costs by 2 per cent a month - quite possible if you are currently on the standard variable rate - could save you \u00a350,000 over the lifetime of the loan on a \u00a3100,000 property. Lenders are making huge sums from the lazy borrowers sitting on the standard variable rate (of 7.74 per cent in many banks and building societies) - while more alert borrowers are getting fixed and discount deals, bringing their rate below 6 per cent. </p> <p> <b> 27 </b> Beware of independent financial advisers urging you to take out (expensive) critical-illness plans. With charges coming down on pension plans, they need to make their money elsewhere - and this is where many will focus. </p> <p> <b> 28 </b> Get your baby a stakeholder pension. The new scheme, starting in April, sets no minimum age for taking out a plan. If you build up funds for your children - taking advantage of the automatic tax relief of 22 per cent given to all plan-holders, regardless of earnings level - they might never need to make pension contributions at all. </p> <p> <b> 29 </b> See financial advisers or salespeople as a couple if you are in a partnership. Women are far more likely to ask those basic (and crucial) questions that many men are embarrassed to ask. </p> <p> <b> 30 </b> Think of investing up to 10 per cent of your savings in emerging markets funds - but only if you can afford to lose the money. See this as a long-term investment of 15 to 40 years. The developing economies now have the biggest potential for growth and financial return. South East Asian funds shot up by 80 per cent and 17 per cent in the past two years - whereas you would be lucky to get 10 per cent a year in more mature Western markets. But be aware that volatility is inherent in new market investments: as well as reaping big rewards, you could also lose everything if there is a coup in the country you invest in, widespread fraud or some other disaster. </p> <p> <b> 31 </b> Put some savings into an Individual Savings Account where growth and income are tax-free. When you open up a standard building society account, you are taxed on the interest - but with ISA accounts you don't have to pay tax. You could double the amount of interest you receive by going this route. </p> <p> <b> 32 </b> Choose your career with care. The reason that women earn just 75 per cent of what men earn is not just to do with career breaks or sexism: women tend to go into low-paying careers such as nursing in greater numbers. If you are going to university, choose your degree subject with an eye to the returns. Law and politics graduates earn 50 per cent more than agriculture graduates, according to Warwick University. </p> <p> <b> 33 </b> Recognise that keeping fit saves you money and gives you freedom. Thousands of old women live in old people's homes now because they lack the upper body strength to draw a curtain or get out of a chair.

      "bodyText": "The panel Maureen Freely writes about relationships. She says her main qualification is that she's a veteran of many bad ones. 'I know what other people should avoid doing.'

Barefoot Doctor teaches Taoism, meditation, Chinese medicine and t'ai chi and has a regular column in Life. He is also the author of several books including The Barefoot Doctor's Handbook for the Urban Warrior (\u00a38.99, Piatkus). Relationships Maureen Freely 1 Follow the example of Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, author of The Jewish Book of Adultery, who says that the best way to keep a stable relationship passionate is to build in periods of abstinence. Let both parties ache for it before they allow themselves to have it. 2 Try using what's called 'paradoxical problem solving'. For example, instead of going into counselling to express your sexual boredom, first try changing the position of your bed. This is not as silly as it sounds. With paradoxical problem solving, instead of seeking a logical or rational resolution to a domestic drama, all you do is rearrange the props and, without a single earnest discussion, break the deadlock. 3 Find out if someone is as interested in you as you are in them by doing the following: next time you meet for a drink, calculate the distance between your drink and theirs and then push your drink forward so it is twice as close. If the person flinches or moves the glass, you still have a lot of work to do. If he/she does not seem to mind, try pushing it a little closer, then a little closer still. If your glass meets with no resistance whatsoever, the chances are you won't either. 4 If pressed for time, try what relationship guru Laura Corn calls 'quickies'. If, for example, you like someone, just say so. If you want to meet for a coffee, or equally have sex on the kitchen floor, go for it, now. And don't worry if it's over almost before it begins. Ten minutes of intense pleasure are about all anyone can take in a 24-hour day. 5 Be warned by John Gottman - the world's most accurate expert on marital relations. In one study he was able to predict with 94 per cent accuracy which couples in his studies would divorce within three years. The earliest warning sign is frequent harsh personal criticism and it can be non-verbal as well as verbal. In Gottman's lab studies, wherever wives' faces registered disgust at their husbands' words four or five times in a 15-minute period, the couple were likely to separate within four years. 6 Avoid 'flooding'. This is when you're so upset you can't think, or when he/she seems not to hear a word you've said. This is not just in your head. It's an unpleasant physical state in which your heartbeat is about 10 beats a minute above your normal level, and adrenaline is racing through your bloodstream. Our friend Gottman has trained some couples to stop and count their pulse mid-argument. If they detect flooding, they then call a 20-minute time-out and retire to their separate corners to practise their favourite relaxation techniques. 7 Stick to the point. If you want to keep your rows from turning into plate-smashing ceremonies, Daniel Goleman, author of Emotional Intelligence, advises that you avoid throwing in the other thousand things that are driving you mad about a person. Thus, if the argument started out being about the red socks that got in with the whites by mistake and turned everything pink, it should still be about red socks and pink sheets when it comes to a close. When you are making a complaint, be specific - not just about the thing you don't like, but how you feel about it, and what you'd like to happen instead. 8 Try 'mirroring' - another technique relationship that experts recommend. What this means is that when your loved one complains about something you do, you throw away your standard defensive responses, eg: 'Yes, but', 'You can talk', and 'Have you ever heard the one about people who live in glass houses?' and instead listen carefully to the complaint, and then repeat it back to him/her, in his/her own words and ask if you have understood correctly. This technique keeps the temperature cool and the level of communication high. 9 Remember that ratios count. According to Gottman, if the amount of time you spend arguing with your partner is only a seventh of the amount you spend together happily, your relationship is doing very well. If 60 per cent of your problems are unresolvable, you're normal, so don't worry. Instead, try building up goodwill by practising what the experts call validation. This means praising people for work well done, or generous gestures appreciated. 10 Don't underestimate the importance of time spent alone together and bear in mind that the harder it is to arrange, the more important it is to arrange it. How you spend that time is also crucial. Leave behind mundane domestic matters on these occasions and talk instead about the big things: your hopes, your dreams and your fears. And how about this? Instead of drawing up a list of personal New Year's resolutions, sit down together and think of three things you've never done, or never done together, that you'd like to do before the year is out. 11 Finally, if you feel you're putting a lot more into a relationship than the other person is, or if you're upset because you're ready to settle down into something more permanent and he/she very clearly isn't or you find yourself waking up in the middle of the night with worst-case scenario jealous fantasies, you could do worse than try the Ana\u00efs Nin Cure. That is, you take the same worst-case scenario but this time make yourself its main player; perfect happiness, according to Nin, means having not one, not two, but three lovers on the go. That way you're never bored, always busy, and have at least one person waiting in the wings who is just dying to give you a good time. Culture Euan Ferguson 12 Throw away your telly. A little drastic, certainly, but if you're going to spend one year of your life wholly freed from spoonfed dumbo cretin-babble it might as well be this one. Britons are rushing back to the cinema and you should join them, for there will be nothing good on television in the coming year. 13 Subscribe to McSweeney's, a quarterly American magazine of new writing due to be distributed in Britain next year, and one of the most savagely cool things to appear between hard covers. Edited as a labour of love by Dave Eggers, author of A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius, it switches format and price from issue to issue (the most recent was individual pamphlets presented in a box), is typographically stunning and is printed, naturally, in Iceland. 14 Log on to either www.tvgohome.com or www.theonion.com, two of the few genuinely funny things on the interwebnet. The first, a set of spoof TV listings, is more creative and entertaining than 99 per cent of the medium it parodies. 15 Buy five jazz albums and spend some time falling in love with smart music. You could do far worse, for a starter kit, than the following: Kind of Blue by Miles Davis, naturally, still the classic post-war jazz recording; A Love Supreme , the best collection around of John Coltrane; Elegiac Cycle by Brad Mehldau and Soul on Soul by Dave Douglas, the improvisers of the moment on, respectively, piano and trumpet; and Promenade with Duke by the late Michel Petrucciani, the world's formost Ellington interpreter. 16 Brush up on your Tolkien, even if you hate it. When the film comes out, no party will be safe from a Lord of the Rings conversation, so make sure you have something to say, even if it's simply, 'I never read it; and nor, happily, did I spent my entire teenage years making horrid cracking sounds with my knuckles and picking my sweaty feet and masturbating.' If you want to say something else, remember that the Elf language was based on Finnish, the Orc vernacular based on Turkish, that Tolkien (John Ronald Reuel) wrote half of it sitting in a tree and that the filming was interrupted last year when the New Zealand army, acting as paid extras, had to take off their goblin outfits to go and fight with the UN in East Timor. 17 Go to Colombia. Cartagena, on the Caribbean coast, features both a lovely old cobbled city and a new hedonistic overflow of clubs, casinos and beaches, and will be the destination of choice for those in the know. 18 Turn Japanese. Japan 2001, a year-long celebration of the country and its culture and trends and gadgets and wars, really kicks off in May with a spectacular Matsuri jamboree in Hyde Park - but you should try to get with the programme before tout London is dressing and dancing like Tokyo. If you want to escape all this, take a quick trip to Rotterdam, the year's joint European City of Culture with Oporto - a fine Breughel the Elder show begins at the renovated Boijmans Van Beuningen Museum on 27 May. 19 Become a Friend of Tate Modern, and win cultured access to the grooviest bar in London, the private riverside terrace on the fifth floor. But don't stay in the capital all the time: Walsall's New Art Gallery has already attracted more than 210,000 visitors in less than a year and features, along with the Picassos and Chagalls, lift announcements by Noddy Holder. 20 Join a poetry workshop. Key fact: make sure it's a good one, such as that run by Michael Donaghy at London City University, not a pony one attended by Lord of the Ring's aficionados and wet-lipped, recently divorced, failed marketing managers called Malcolm feeling sorry for themselves. Donaghy's, however, is not for the faint-hearted or emotionally dishonest; his deconstruction of your own work will help, but it will scare. 21 Go to Dulwich College in south London, before the end of February, to see the James Caird, the wooden boat in which Ernest Shackleton and an exhausted crew crossed 800 miles of open sea to South Georgia to secure rescue for the marooned men on his failed 1916 expedition, and the marvellous accompanying photographs of hell on ice. 22 Fly to New York to visit the stunning Rose Space Center and new Planetarium. Take in, on the way, a ruinously expensive but delightful cocktail at the Campbell Apartment, a splendidly restored chic hideaway beside Grand Central Station. Money Neasa MacErlean 23 Don't see your parents as financial gurus. Even the big City regulator the Financial Services Authority is concerned that up to 40 per cent of people consult their parents, which is OK if you want views and recommendations from 20 years back, but not OK for now. 24 Start being entrepreneurial. A degree and a profession will pay the mortgage but won't give you the financial freedom that comes from running clever businesses, renting out property or owning other well-picked income-generating assets. 25 Get yourself computer-literate for free. The first one million people who apply can get a \u00a3150 subsidy for a training course through the government's Individual Learning Account scheme (0800 072 5678). 26 Work out what you will do with the money you save from switching mortgages. Cutting your costs by 2 per cent a month - quite possible if you are currently on the standard variable rate - could save you \u00a350,000 over the lifetime of the loan on a \u00a3100,000 property. Lenders are making huge sums from the lazy borrowers sitting on the standard variable rate (of 7.74 per cent in many banks and building societies) - while more alert borrowers are getting fixed and discount deals, bringing their rate below 6 per cent. 27 Beware of independent financial advisers urging you to take out (expensive) critical-illness plans. With charges coming down on pension plans, they need to make their money elsewhere - and this is where many will focus. 28 Get your baby a stakeholder pension. The new scheme, starting in April, sets no minimum age for taking out a plan. If you build up funds for your children - taking advantage of the automatic tax relief of 22 per cent given to all plan-holders, regardless of earnings level - they might never need to make pension contributions at all. 29 See financial advisers or salespeople as a couple if you are in a partnership. Women are far more likely to ask those basic (and crucial) questions that many men are embarrassed to ask. 30 Think of investing up to 10 per cent of your savings in emerging markets funds - but only if you can afford to lose the money. See this as a long-term investment of 15 to 40 years. The developing economies now have the biggest potential for growth and financial return. South East Asian funds shot up by 80 per cent and 17 per cent in the past two years - whereas you would be lucky to get 10 per cent a year in more mature Western markets. But be aware that volatility is inherent in new market investments: as well as reaping big rewards, you could also lose everything if there is a coup in the country you invest in, widespread fraud or some other disaster. 31 Put some savings into an Individual Savings Account where growth and income are tax-free. When you open up a standard building society account, you are taxed on the interest - but with ISA accounts you don't have to pay tax. You could double the amount of interest you receive by going this route. 32 Choose your career with care. The reason that women earn just 75 per cent of what men earn is not just to do with career breaks or sexism: women tend to go into low-paying careers such as nursing in greater numbers. If you are going to university, choose your degree subject with an eye to the returns. Law and politics graduates earn 50 per cent more than agriculture graduates, according to Warwick University. 33 Recognise that keeping fit saves you money and gives you freedom. Thousands of old women live in old people's homes now because they lack the upper body strength to draw a curtain or get out of a chair. Even in your 80s, a few gentle aerobics classes will tone those muscles again. Work Eileen Mulligan 34 Select a job that is in line with your values so that your career choice is based on 'suitability' as well as 'capability'. List your top 10 values, ideally in order of priority, to remind yourself of what's important to you. Common values include security, challenge, recognition, job satisfaction, family life and health. 35 Bear in mind that you're in the best possible position to negotiate a salary increase when you (a) know what the market will bear in your job/profession, (b) have had positive feedback on your performance and (c) can demonstrate that you are meeting the objectives of your job and, if necessary, are exceeding them. 36 Avoid unnecessary confrontation by using effective communication.

I was always playing football from when I was a toddler. </p> <p> <strong> Did you get to see English football as a child, and did you support an English team? </strong><br> I didn't know anything about English football. It's too far away. And anyway, there is enough football in Brazil keep us occupied. </p> <p><strong> When did you first play professional football?</strong><br> In 1995 for my old club Corinthians. I was 20 years old. </p> <p> <strong> How did your move to England come about? </strong><br> I played professionally for five years but I had been in Corinthinas all my life, from when I was an amateur - maybe 12 years in total. When I received an invitation from Arsenal I was very happy. It is one of the best teams in England at the moment. </p> <p> <strong> Had you heard of your current team before you joined them? </strong><br>Some things, but only because there are so many great players here: Dennis Bergkamp, Emmanuel Petit, Patrick Vieira, Tony Adams. <br></p> <p> <strong>What were your first impressions of English football, and how have they changed? </strong><br> It was very difficult at the beginning because the style of play is so different. I was also pleased because everything about the game was very competitive but also fun. With time I have come to think the British way is the best way in the world. </p> <p> <strong> Where are you living? </strong><br> When I first arrived I stayed in a hotel for three and a half months, and since then I live in a house in New Barnet. It's North London, close to the training ground, and I like it. It's very different from Sao Paulo - much better in some ways. I can walk on the street and everyone shows respect. Sometimes in Sao Paulo after you have lost a game you can't venture out, can't go to a restaurant, can't go anywhere. It's a religion. </p> <p> <strong> Have you got any family with you? </strong><br> No parents, sisters, brothers; just me and my wife. My parents came to visit two months ago and they stayed for about a month. My wife's parents came last season.<br></p> <p><strong> Do you send any money home? </strong><br> No, my family is ok. </p> <p> <strong>What do you like and dislike most about living in England? </strong><br> I wanted to learn English because it is the universal language. It's a country where they offer you very good conditions to live and work. I don't like it when it's raining a lot, just because I play football. If you stay at home you don't need to worry about it but when you are going out to play and you see it is rainy it's terrible. When you are used to playing in 20-25 degrees you need to motivate yourself to go out when it's like that. I had never played in the rain before I came here. </p> <p> <strong> What do you do in the afternoons and evenings? </strong><br> I like to watch movies. Sometimes I go to the cinema or theatre. </p> <p> <strong>Have you learned to speak English? </strong><br> It's not easy for me. How can I explain? I needed to understand how to get by in training, games, hotel but I didn't have any time to have lessons three or four hours a day so I learned as I went along, listening to my team-mates at Arsenal. I can communicate much better now than when I arrived, it took about six months until I felt comfortable. Once I have completed two years here I am sure I will be better. </p> <p> <strong> Is English football better or worse than you expected?</strong><br> I didn't know about English football but it is very impressive to me. A hard game, physical game, difficult game. It's a good football battle. Arsene Wenger was very good to me because he gave me about six months to adapt to the game, and he kept encouraging me to go forward even thought I play in defence. </p> <p> <strong> Is the atmosphere in the dressing room different that to in other countries? </strong><br> Completely different, and not just compared to Brazil. I was in the national team and my team-mates were telling me in Italy you cannot speak on the bus, other places you can't talk to the boss or make a joke. I told them you can do all that in England. I like having the stereo as well. The atmosphere is more relaxed and it motivates us. In Brazil it is quieter and each player gets on with their own routine. </p> <p> <strong> How does training differ from what you are used to? </strong><br> Basically it's the same balance between working with the ball and physical work. In Brazil because of the temparatures we normally did two sessions a day, and also because the game is not so physical it's easier to train more - and play the games - without it taking too much out of you. </p> <p> <strong> What do you like most about English football? </strong><br> Every stadium is a full house! It's not like that in Brazil. My old club Corinthians had a lot of fans - it's a big club like Arsenal - but if you go through a bad patch they desert you. Sometimes 100,000, sometimes not. </p> <p> <strong> What do you like least about it? </strong><br> Sometimes the referees. Because it's a physical game I understand it makes the referee's job a hard one, but so many people go over the top. </p> <p> <strong> How do English fans compare to those in other countries you have played in?</strong><br> I like the way the British fans are so polite when they approach a player to ask for an autograph. They wait, one by one, whereas sometimes in Brazil you are just mobbed by a crowd. It is more civilised here, people give you more space.</p> <p><strong> Have you experienced racism by opponents or opposing fans?</strong><br> Nothing.</p> <p> <strong> How long do you think you will stay in English football? </strong><br> You never know with football. I have a contract here that I intend to fulfil. I am happier with my professional life here. It's wonderful.</p>",

It's a beautiful city, so much history.</p> <p> <strong>Have you learned to speak English? </strong><br> I learned English at school. I always used to study very hard and wanted to have a good career. I believe that education is very important.

Madrid are a contradiction, they are a big club yet they only have two pitches to train on. Here at Middlesbrough we have 15 pitches and a whole new training complex with everything you can imagine. It is amazing and a credit to the chairman and the Gaffer that the club is in such a healthy condition. We are not doing so well on the pitch at the moment, but with more self-belief I know we can turn it around. We have some very good players here.</p> <p> <strong>What do you like most about living in England? </strong><br>I love it. English life always surprises me. Everyday something different happens.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> <strong>Birthplace: </strong> Vancouver, Canada<br> Now playing for Inverness in the Scottish First Division<br><strong>Age: </strong> 24 <br> <strong>Position: </strong> Forward <br> Joined Inverness on free transfer from Dutch club Dordrecht 90 in Sept 1999 <br><strong> Appearances: </strong> 32 (6)<br><strong>First played professional football for?</strong> Sporting Lisbon <br>(Other clubs: University of Portland, Stoke City, St.Johnstone, Dordrecht 90)<br></p> <p> <strong>Did you get to see English/Scottish football as a child, and did you support anyone? </strong><br> Not much, my father is from Italy so growing up I was always into Italian football, I was a big Juventus fan. I first heard about the English Premier league when I was 15 or 16, you can watch it in bars in Canada at 10am over breakfast or a beer - that turns into long drinking session for some people! I did see Peter Beardsley play, he was at Vancouver for a while and was the first English player I ever saw in person. As for Scottish football, everybody knows about Celtic and Rangers but that's about it.</p> <p> <strong>How did your move to Britain come about? </strong><br> My Canadian national team coach Bruce Twamley who worked with Bobby Robson at Ipswich, suggested to Bobby to take me on trial at Sporting Lisbon to get me some experience and Bobby agreed. I was quite close to him while I was out there, I still see him occasionally. He comes on holiday to Canada quite often, the last time he came over we played golf together. I left Lisbon after six months, I was 17 at the time and didn't feel ready for such a big change in lifestyle so I came back to Canada and went through university majoring in finance. There were no professional clubs in Canada for me to join, the CSL (Canadian Soccer League) had just folded, so I just played college football. My move over here came up through my agent, it was kind of a friend of a friend thing, and was a great opportunity for me.</p> <p> <strong>Had you heard of Inverness before you joined? </strong><br> Yes I had, we have another Canadian International Richard Hastings who plays here, so I had heard of them through him.</p> <p> <strong>What were your first impressions of British football? </strong><br> Not good! In my first game for Inverness I dislocated my shoulder and was out for eight weeks! Seriously though, it was a steep learning curve to come from playing college football in Canada to professional football in the UK. The pace of the game is so fast, and the games are so physical, even compared to Holland, where things are more skilful and tactical and you get more time on the ball. The game here is more direct, and although there are hard tackles in football all over the world, because of the pace of the game here, they are flying in so much more often that it takes some getting used to. When you have a 200-pound, six-foot three Scotsman running into you, believe me, you know about it. I have a much harder match playing for Inverness than I do for Canada.</p> <p> <strong>Where are you living now? </strong><br> I have a house in Inverness with a fantastic view that I moved into six months ago. When I was at St Johnstone I lived in a hotel for over five months, it was great for the first month, but after that you get bored of eating there and only having your room to go back to. You really need your own place to stay sane.</p> <p> <strong>Have you got any family over with you? </strong><br> No, my girlfriend Jacquie lived with me for the past two years, she has gone back over to Canada to finish her degree, we are getting engaged over Christmas and hopefully she will be back here soon. I only really get to go home to see everyone once a year over the summer for a few weeks. When I go home to play internationals it's not like here where everywhere is so close, no-one gets a chance to visit family or friends. It's very much - go home, play the game, come back again.</p> <p> <strong>What do you like and dislike about living in Scotland?</strong><br> I don't like being so far away from home. It gets a little chilly in the winter here too, so my friends and family back home would rather be in Mexico or Hawaii than coming over to see me. There is a slow pace of life here which although I really like, it's very much for families, not exactly what you'd call a single person's paradise. Even though I have a girlfriend, I still like a night out with the lads, and there's only a handful of bars to go to. The television here is terrible - its sucks, although some friends of mine gave me some Roy Chubby Brown videos which were funny. Food wise, I do like Bangers and Mash and have tried Haggis a couple times - never again!</p> <p> <strong>How does the training differ to what you are used to?</strong><br> The training varies depending on if we have a game coming up, usually I'm finished by one.

      "bodyText": "Birthplace: Vancouver, Canada Now playing for Inverness in the Scottish First Division Age: 24 Position: Forward Joined Inverness on free transfer from Dutch club Dordrecht 90 in Sept 1999 Appearances: 32 (6) First played professional football for? Sporting Lisbon (Other clubs: University of Portland, Stoke City, St.Johnstone, Dordrecht 90) Did you get to see English/Scottish football as a child, and did you support anyone? Not much, my father is from Italy so growing up I was always into Italian football, I was a big Juventus fan. I first heard about the English Premier league when I was 15 or 16, you can watch it in bars in Canada at 10am over breakfast or a beer - that turns into long drinking session for some people! I did see Peter Beardsley play, he was at Vancouver for a while and was the first English player I ever saw in person. As for Scottish football, everybody knows about Celtic and Rangers but that's about it. How did your move to Britain come about? My Canadian national team coach Bruce Twamley who worked with Bobby Robson at Ipswich, suggested to Bobby to take me on trial at Sporting Lisbon to get me some experience and Bobby agreed. I was quite close to him while I was out there, I still see him occasionally. He comes on holiday to Canada quite often, the last time he came over we played golf together. I left Lisbon after six months, I was 17 at the time and didn't feel ready for such a big change in lifestyle so I came back to Canada and went through university majoring in finance. There were no professional clubs in Canada for me to join, the CSL (Canadian Soccer League) had just folded, so I just played college football. My move over here came up through my agent, it was kind of a friend of a friend thing, and was a great opportunity for me. Had you heard of Inverness before you joined? Yes I had, we have another Canadian International Richard Hastings who plays here, so I had heard of them through him. What were your first impressions of British football? Not good! In my first game for Inverness I dislocated my shoulder and was out for eight weeks! Seriously though, it was a steep learning curve to come from playing college football in Canada to professional football in the UK. The pace of the game is so fast, and the games are so physical, even compared to Holland, where things are more skilful and tactical and you get more time on the ball. The game here is more direct, and although there are hard tackles in football all over the world, because of the pace of the game here, they are flying in so much more often that it takes some getting used to. When you have a 200-pound, six-foot three Scotsman running into you, believe me, you know about it. I have a much harder match playing for Inverness than I do for Canada. Where are you living now? I have a house in Inverness with a fantastic view that I moved into six months ago. When I was at St Johnstone I lived in a hotel for over five months, it was great for the first month, but after that you get bored of eating there and only having your room to go back to. You really need your own place to stay sane. Have you got any family over with you? No, my girlfriend Jacquie lived with me for the past two years, she has gone back over to Canada to finish her degree, we are getting engaged over Christmas and hopefully she will be back here soon. I only really get to go home to see everyone once a year over the summer for a few weeks. When I go home to play internationals it's not like here where everywhere is so close, no-one gets a chance to visit family or friends. It's very much - go home, play the game, come back again. What do you like and dislike about living in Scotland? I don't like being so far away from home. It gets a little chilly in the winter here too, so my friends and family back home would rather be in Mexico or Hawaii than coming over to see me. There is a slow pace of life here which although I really like, it's very much for families, not exactly what you'd call a single person's paradise. Even though I have a girlfriend, I still like a night out with the lads, and there's only a handful of bars to go to. The television here is terrible - its sucks, although some friends of mine gave me some Roy Chubby Brown videos which were funny. Food wise, I do like Bangers and Mash and have tried Haggis a couple times - never again! How does the training differ to what you are used to? The training varies depending on if we have a game coming up, usually I'm finished by one. Over here before the game they name the team and give a little pep talk then send you out to play. In Holland and Portugal it is a lot more technical and tactical, they sit you down they put four or five different charts on the board, with your name on, what you should be doing and runs you should be making. Here it's just a case of 'go get 'em' or 'get stuck in'. What do you do in the afternoons and evenings? Occasionally golf depending on the weather.

It's very green, a city of agriculture, and it also has a good reputation nurturing sports - all sports do well there. </p> <p> <strong> Did you get to see English football as a child, and did you support an English team? </strong><br> I always watched the best games in Wembley, teams like Arsenal, Man U, Chelsea. Inspired by what I saw on television all my childhood I dreamed about two things - playing for Real Madrid, and playing at Wembley. The history, the pitch, atmosphere, it's my dream. I didn't support an English team, I always supported Real Madrid as a team and Maradona as a player. This was my life.</p> <p><strong> First played professional football for? </strong><br> Osijek, in Croatia. I was 16 when I made my debut, the youngest player to be a professional in Croatia's history.</p> <p> <strong> Clubs since?</strong><br> Dynamo Zagreb, Sevilla, Real Madrid, Arsenal, West Ham.</p> <p> <strong> How did your move to England come about? </strong><br> I had played eight years in Spain and it was time to look to the future. English clubs are very strong in Europe, and many Croatian players told me it was an excellent league. I had other opportunities in many other countries but I wanted to come here. I enjoy playing at the birthplace of football - real football is here. I savour the old culture. Outside of football there was one other main reason to come: to learn English. It's very important, a big profit for football players. It's a hard profession for 16 years but you have some privileges: learning a language, making many friends abroad. These friendships stay with you after football. </p> <p> <strong> Had you heard of West Ham before you joined them?</strong><br> Yes. </p> <p> <strong>What were your first impressions of English football, and how have they changed? </strong><br> My first impression was that it is honest football. People run, people fight, but it's always honest. Referees make mistakes but they too are honest.</p> <p> <strong> More honest than Spain? </strong><br> 100%. </p> <p> <strong> More honest than Croatia?</strong><br> 100%. It's more professional here. Even if you are having a good or bad day, you have to fight for the shirt. </p> <p> <strong>Where are you living? </strong><br> I am renting a flat in Knightsbridge. </p> <p> <strong>Have you got any family with you? </strong><br> I live alone but a couple of times a year my family come to visit me in London, and my friends come too.</p> <p> <strong> Do you send any money home?</strong><br> Of course. I am proud, I am a football player who has played for 16 years thank God, and I am lucky that I can help all my family. I feel that I have fulfilled something and I feel good about that. I also want to give something to football in my country. I would like to open a soccer academy in Zagreb and I have prepared all the plans for next year. I want to employ some coaches to teach groups from 8-10 years, 10-12, etc. Most of all I want to teach them how to score goals. I would like to talk to the youngsters to explain what qualities you need - how you need to control the ball, how you need to feel when you are one on one with the goalkeeper. The best word is cold. We are a small country and I hope everyone will help to promote Croatia, to make the country stronger and happier, more than just the beautiful Adriatic Sea. </p> <p><strong> What do you like and dislike most about living in England? </strong><br> I like organisation and England is a very organised country. I lived eight years in Spain and two years in England and I would like to live in Croatia with the same kind of respect for rules I have seen on my travels. Sometimes we are stifled by too many restrictions. I like the fact everybody here has a chance, and there are so many opportunities. I would like to have the same in my country, where kids finish school and they don't have jobs. The percentage of unemployment is much worse than England. I hope we will be in the European Community soon. It's vital. What do I dislike about England? Come on, the weather! But having said that we footballers have privileges, we have five airports in London and in two hours you are on the coast. </p> <p> <strong> What do you do in the afternoons and evenings? </strong><br> Sit in a caf\u00e9 and enjoy a cappuccino or a cup of tea with my friends. I like a cup of tea. I have many friends here from different nationalities and it's beautiful to enjoy that cosmopolitan variety in London. After tea I have a Spanish siesta, one hour minimum, where I can go into my world, my totally private sanctuary. </p> <p> <strong> Have you learned to speak English?</strong><br> I have some books, and my friends correct me when I make a mistake. Sometimes it's funny but I'm not scared of language. I'm not perfect but I'm not an English man. I'm Croatian and I'm learning.</p> <p> <strong> Is English football better or worse than you expected?</strong><br> Champions League is one test of a club's quality. Manchester United won recently, and although last year Spanish teams were very dominant now we have many teams who play very well, which reflects well on the Premier League. The standard is how I expected. </p> <p> <strong> Is the atmosphere in the dressing room different to that in other countries?</strong><br> One hundred per cent. I've learned something new here. Before I didn't used to smile before the game, never experienced loud music and a hot atmosphere. In the past in Europe I have come across some coaches who didn't speak, didn't like joking, didn't like music. It's democratic here. The philosophy is for the players to go on the pitch and give everything and after the game it's history, victory or defeat. You get over things quicker here than in other countries. Harry Redknapp is my first English coach and we have a good relationship. He is so honest. I caught something positive from my first impressions of him and I like to fight for this man. </p> <p> <strong>How does training differ from what you are used to? </strong><br> It was better with Arsenal! But it's a lovely atmosphere at the training ground. It's a smaller club than Arsenal but I really enjoy it. Because we don't have European competition we have a couple more days free, which is maybe good for the league. That could be important if we want to make the top six. </p> <p><strong> What do you like most about English football? </strong><br> The chanting. Things like \"You're not singing anymore!\" We listen to it out on the pitch and it pushes you.</p> <p> <strong> What do you like least about English football?</strong><br> Losing, but that's the same in any country. </p> <p> <strong> How do English fans compare to those in other countries you have played in? </strong><br> I like the fact the fans stay behind you even when you lose. I haven't experienced this loyalty before, where they never turn on the players. It's not like that in Spain or Italy, where there is more negaitvity and people saying bad things.</p> <p> <strong> Have you experienced racism by opponents or opposing fans? </strong><br> No, and if I heard such stuff I would leave. I support the Kick the Racism out of Football campaign. You need to open people's minds. Football has given me my life and I have to respect it for that.</p> <p> <strong> How long do you think you will stay in English football? </strong><br> Er... 10 years! I wait for an English passport! Honestly, you never know. I am 32 (he was 33 on 1 January) and I want to keep playing as long as possible. At the moment I would like to finish my career here, but in football you never know.</p>",

Today's Premiership is on Chinese TV all the time, but even ten years ago we saw a lot of the old Division One. And, yes, I watched Crystal Palace a lot. They finished third in 1991 behind Arsenal and Liverpool, with Ian Wright scoring constantly. But in the years before that I most enjoyed watching Liverpool pass and move the ball, with people like Ray Houghton who coaches here now, and watching players like Glenn Hoddle. They were my favourites, but the pace and passion of the whole game here has always attracted me. </p> <p><strong>First played professional football for?</strong><br> Shanghai.</p> <p> <strong>How did your move to England come about?</strong><br> Terry Venables spotted me during England's tour of China in 1996, and Ted Buxton, China's former coach and then a coach at Crystal Palace, knew about Sun Jihai. They signed both of us after we came over here on tour in 1998.</p> <p> <strong>Had you heard of Crystal Palace before you joined them?</strong><br> Well, as I said, Ian Wright was an inspiration for me. Palace had a great time in the early 90s, and now I want to help us do it again.</p> <p><strong>What were your first impressions of English football?</strong><br></p> <p>I was shocked by the speed and aggression, even though I was expecting a very different style to that at Shanghai. The game moves so quickly - defence turns to attack in an instant - but my coaches and colleagues helped me adjust and cope with the pace. The concentration needed to play successfully here is high, but I think now I\u00d5m playing better this season than last.</p> <p> <strong>Where are you living now?</strong><br> I have bought a house in Purley, which is a nice place to live. All the neighbours are very generous, and my wife and our little girl Fan Si Jing are very happy - my daughter even knows a few words of English. But when I first arrived I was living in the Selsdon Park Hotel in Croydon: a very nice hotel for golfers but I don't play I golf. I did feel very isolated. But Jihai and I gave each other moral support, and everyone at the club helped us settle down, everyone looked after us.

      "bodyText": "Birthplace: Shanghai, China Now playing for Crystal Palace in the First Division Age: 30 Position: Central defender/striker Joined Crystal Palace for \u00a3700,000 from Shanghai Shenhua in September 1998 Appearances: 85 (1) Did you get to see English football as a child, and did you support anyone? As a young footballer in Shanghai, I watched the old English Division One whenever I could. Today's Premiership is on Chinese TV all the time, but even ten years ago we saw a lot of the old Division One. And, yes, I watched Crystal Palace a lot. They finished third in 1991 behind Arsenal and Liverpool, with Ian Wright scoring constantly. But in the years before that I most enjoyed watching Liverpool pass and move the ball, with people like Ray Houghton who coaches here now, and watching players like Glenn Hoddle. They were my favourites, but the pace and passion of the whole game here has always attracted me. First played professional football for? Shanghai. How did your move to England come about? Terry Venables spotted me during England's tour of China in 1996, and Ted Buxton, China's former coach and then a coach at Crystal Palace, knew about Sun Jihai. They signed both of us after we came over here on tour in 1998. Had you heard of Crystal Palace before you joined them? Well, as I said, Ian Wright was an inspiration for me. Palace had a great time in the early 90s, and now I want to help us do it again. What were your first impressions of English football? I was shocked by the speed and aggression, even though I was expecting a very different style to that at Shanghai. The game moves so quickly - defence turns to attack in an instant - but my coaches and colleagues helped me adjust and cope with the pace. The concentration needed to play successfully here is high, but I think now I\u00d5m playing better this season than last. Where are you living now? I have bought a house in Purley, which is a nice place to live. All the neighbours are very generous, and my wife and our little girl Fan Si Jing are very happy - my daughter even knows a few words of English. But when I first arrived I was living in the Selsdon Park Hotel in Croydon: a very nice hotel for golfers but I don't play I golf. I did feel very isolated. But Jihai and I gave each other moral support, and everyone at the club helped us settle down, everyone looked after us. We soon overcame the initial fears and loneliness. Have you got any family over with you? Besides my wife and daughter, my parents come to watch when it is possible. They are both sportspeople - my father played for Shanghai too, long before football in China became professional in 1994, while my mother was an international athlete. They are very pleased to see what I am doing now, and enjoy their visits to London and to Selhurst Park. Do you send any money home? No - we are comfortable.

I think dressing rooms are the same the world over.

Satellite channels only became available in India about three years ago, so I was already playing when I first started to watch it. I never supported anyone, I just enjoyed watching a good game and liked teams that played good football. Growing up, I watched a lot of local football and like everyone else in India, had local heroes. I always used to watch the World Cup on TV, and I really admired Maradona. </p> <p><strong> First played professional football for? </strong><br>East Bengal, who I joined as a semi-professional when I left school. No one in India is a full-time professional, even the well known players. I also played for a team called JCT but only for one season. </p> <p> <strong> How did your move to England come about? </strong><br> When I first came over I had a trial at Aston Villa, but I ended up at Bury because my agent knew someone who was good friends with their manager Neil Warnock. He gave me a trial and it went from there. </p> <p> <strong>Had you heard of Bury before you joined them? </strong><br> No. </p> <p> <strong> What were your first impressions of English football? </strong><br> I found it very difficult to start with, I was used to playing in India where obviously the temperature is very high, so the style of play is totally different - a lot slower. As well as the fast pace of the game, I had to get used to the physical aspect of English football, which is a lot tougher than I what I was used to back home. </p> <p> <strong> Where are you living now? </strong><br> As soon as I joined Bury, they helped me find my own place, where I am still living now.</p> <p><strong> Have you got any family over with you?</strong><br> No. I went to see them all this summer and while I continue playing, I'm going to try and go home to see them at least once a year. </p> <p> <strong>Do you send any money home?</strong><br> No I don't, not at the moment anyway.</p> <p> <strong> What do you like and dislike about living in England? </strong><br> Obviously I miss my family and my friends, so it can get lonely sometimes. I knew when I joined, that coming from a different culture, speaking a different language I was going to have a difficult time to start with. Back home, I am surrounded by friends, so coming here to live on my own was a big challenge. But I was prepared and very determined to make a success of it. It took me a couple of months to settle in and get used to things. </p> <p> <strong> What do you do in the afternoons and evenings?</strong><br> I usually leave the training ground after lunch, and either relax at home, go out to get some food or go to the cinema - whatever I feel like really. Manchester is close by so I occasionally go there. Some evenings I go out with the other players and friends for a meal or for a few drinks, although I'm not a big drinker. </p> <p> <strong> Is English football better or worse than you expected? </strong><br> I always knew the standard of football was very high in England, so I expected it to be difficult. The facilities over here are very good. In India training grounds are unheard of and even the big clubs don't have them. </p> <p> <strong>Have you learned to speak English? </strong><br>In India, you learn English in grammar school. You are told it is very important to learn to speak English, so when I came over there wasn't really a problem. </p> <p> <strong> Is the atmosphere in the dressing room different to other countries? </strong><br> It is very different. At home there is a lot more tension, because the crowds are very big, and their expectations are so high. It puts a lot of pressure on the players to do well, especially in the home games. Here, everyone is very focused and relaxed before the game, which I think is the best way to be. If you win it is great because you get a big reaction from all the players, which is a lot of fun. </p> <p> <strong> How does training differ from what you are used to at home?</strong><br> Here the training is more technical than back in India and you get to learn a lot of things. Also you get assigned specific jobs to do in matches. At home there are less tactics. The training here is very hard and professional and I know that I will benefit from that. </p> <p><strong> How do English fans compare to those in other countries you have played in?</strong><br> At home I used to regularly play in front of crowds of over 30,000. The Salt Lake Stadium where I played for East Bengal can hold well over a 100,000 and if it was a derby match it would be full. However, in the regular matches, because the stadium is so big the atmosphere could sometimes get lost. Here, even if you are playing in front of 4,000 people, because the grounds are very compact and the fans are so close to the pitch you can hear everything, so they make just as much noise as the crowds at home. </p> <p> <strong> Have you ever experienced racism by opponents or opposing fans? </strong><br> No I haven't. So far all of the fans have been very supportive of me. </p> <p> <strong> How long do you think you will stay in English football?</strong><br> As long as I have a club, I'm playing well and enjoying it.</p>",

Here the training is more technical than back in India and you get to learn a lot of things. Also you get assigned specific jobs to do in matches. At home there are less tactics. The training here is very hard and professional and I know that I will benefit from that. How do English fans compare to those in other countries you have played in? At home I used to regularly play in front of crowds of over 30,000. The Salt Lake Stadium where I played for East Bengal can hold well over a 100,000 and if it was a derby match it would be full. However, in the regular matches, because the stadium is so big the atmosphere could sometimes get lost. Here, even if you are playing in front of 4,000 people, because the grounds are very compact and the fans are so close to the pitch you can hear everything, so they make just as much noise as the crowds at home. Have you ever experienced racism by opponents or opposing fans? No I haven't. So far all of the fans have been very supportive of me. How long do you think you will stay in English football? As long as I have a club, I'm playing well and enjoying it.",

So, as a starting point, it introduced age into its equal opportunities policy. But to help ensure that this happened it began interviewing applicants for branch jobs by telephone to reduce the possibility of prejudice based on age and appearance. 'We are measuring the person's talent rather than their previous job history,' says Denise Walker, head of corporate personnel. 'This is about the person's contribution, not about their shape, size, colour or age.'</p> <p>Backing up this approach was a flexible benefits system which catered for individuals, rather than the stereotypical family. So the society's 13,000 employees can, for example, choose to have time off to look after elderly parents if they wish - flexibility which makes life easier for older workers.</p> <p>More controversial was abolishing age-related pay increments. Pay is now linked to a staff member's 'contribution' (measured through achievements, personal development and approach to work) rather than length of service. After 10, 20, 30 or 40 years, staff do get a one-off gift or financial reward for their loyalty, but these are one-offs, and not built into basic pay.</p> <p>Nationwide is cited as a model of anti-ageism and recently won a Personnel Today award for this. The changes have brought great benefits for the organisation, says Walker: 'We had a huge turnover and we needed stability. People often want to learn from other people, but it's harder for young people to learn from others in the same age group. They wanted the wisdom of older people.'</p>",

How Nationwide wised up In the past decade, the Nationwide building society has pushed up the proportion of staff aged over 50 in its workforce from 1 to 10 per cent - a move that is now paying dividends in a tightening labour market. It realised it faced big future manpower problems, and a high staff turnover was reducing productivity. So, as a starting point, it introduced age into its equal opportunities policy. But to help ensure that this happened it began interviewing applicants for branch jobs by telephone to reduce the possibility of prejudice based on age and appearance. 'We are measuring the person's talent rather than their previous job history,' says Denise Walker, head of corporate personnel. 'This is about the person's contribution, not about their shape, size, colour or age.' Backing up this approach was a flexible benefits system which catered for individuals, rather than the stereotypical family. So the society's 13,000 employees can, for example, choose to have time off to look after elderly parents if they wish - flexibility which makes life easier for older workers. More controversial was abolishing age-related pay increments. Pay is now linked to a staff member's 'contribution' (measured through achievements, personal development and approach to work) rather than length of service. After 10, 20, 30 or 40 years, staff do get a one-off gift or financial reward for their loyalty, but these are one-offs, and not built into basic pay. Nationwide is cited as a model of anti-ageism and recently won a Personnel Today award for this. The changes have brought great benefits for the organisation, says Walker: 'We had a huge turnover and we needed stability. People often want to learn from other people, but it's harder for young people to learn from others in the same age group. They wanted the wisdom of older people.'",
