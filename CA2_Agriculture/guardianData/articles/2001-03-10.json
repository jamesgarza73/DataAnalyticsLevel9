      "body": "<p>I walked into the wall of heat outside the air-conditioned diner and promptly burned my hand on the bars of my bike. Ahead, the land dropped away to Kansas and the Great Plains; behind lay half of America. The thermometer on the clapboard shack read 101F. It was going to be a tough afternoon. </p> <p>Gingerly, I eased into my broad, black saddle, pausing to glance at Roz as my butt equalised with the frying-pan temperature. It hurt my eyes to look at her primrose-and-buckskin Harley. Against all apparent reason, she was slipping her arms into her armoured riding leathers. I wished she'd let the air flow over her instead, but I knew she wouldn't. She'd heard about tyres ripping off trucks on the rough back roads and sending scantily-clad riders on a fast slide across the gravel. Roz had decided she'd rather boil than bleed. </p> <p>Cross Kansas and Nebraska as quickly as you can, because they're boring, appeared to be the received wisdom. Hit Colorado and Montana to see something worth the trip. I didn't know whether to believe this or not as we rolled down the 50-mile slope on to the gently undulating prairie, but by sundown I knew that our advisers had missed the point. Maybe it was because they drove cars. </p> <p>Secure in an automobile, the traveller is insulated from the cruel climate of the plains by air conditioning, a comfy seat, the radio and his windscreen. The roads may run straight from horizon to heat-blurred horizon, but the motorcyclist's heightened perception demands awareness of every bump and crack under his spinning spokes. Grain silos glimmer like ghosts, wavering in the distance while cattle lazing in ancient buffalo wallows flash by close at hand. To comprehend the perspective puts a British-raised mind at full stretch. </p> <p>Every so often, as we plugged on towards Dodge City, a truck would wobble into view three miles or more ahead. First, it was a smudge of colour several feet above the road, dancing on the heat. It might drop out of sight behind the next dip. Then, suddenly massive, with its turbos screaming, it would be on us, swaying as it ripped by. A wall of hot air threatened to hurl the quarter-ton motorbikes off the road, the blast so thick you can feel it: diesel exhaust, grit and grasshoppers. </p> <p>It was partly the names that sent Roz and I on this pilgrimage to the heart of the US: Cheyenne, Santa F\u00e9 and Flagstaff have called me since boyhood. They are the breath of classic Western movies, the Transcontinental Railroad and Route 66, the very seeds of romance. Now it was leading us 12,000 miles from one small town to the next, into country and communities that grew wilder as we headed west. </p> <p>\"Nice bikes, guys. Where you folks from?\" The young rancher filling up at the only gas station in Tryon, Nebraska, favoured the standard opening. This is a travelling nation. Americans are born on the road. They will move house more than twice as many times as their British equivalents. </p> <p>\"England? You don't say. You got time to come and meet the wife?\" </p> <p>Two hours later, we sat down to lunch in a modern, low-roofed ranch house, joining hands around the table with our host, Kirk, his wife, their two young children and his father - the old man's grandfather had been the first to settle the land. As we gave thanks for our daily bread, I realised that saying grace is not unusual around here. A summer hailstorm can wipe out a whole crop in 15 minutes. Kirk's wife opened a freezer the size of a wardrobe and produced three lumps of ice like tennis balls that had bounced off the family car that spring. Later, she showed me the car's roof. It might have been walloped by a hammer. </p> <p>The following day, we all trucked 90 bullocks to market in North Platte after Grandad had rounded them up. He looked for all the world like John Wayne, except that he rode a Yamaha trail bike instead of a horse. </p> <p>This open-handedness to travellers wraps around you like a blanket in rural America. Perhaps it's the novelty of a new face among people who live miles apart, but I prefer to think it dates from pre-TV times when casual visiting was an art form. We'd encountered it before in West Virginia, where we'd been rescued from the death throes of a hurricane. Sitting on the step of the local store-owner's cabin, we drank home-distilled whiskey and listened to stories from the proprietor and his family. Everyone on that lamplit porch could have earned a good living on the after-dinner speaking circuit. Tales of running moonshine to the Carolinas in all-American cars pursued by tobacco-chewing Feds vied with yarns of not-so-wily hunters trapped up trees with giant racoons scratching and biting them. </p> <p>In between staying with new friends, Roz and I slept under canvas or in motels. Camping offered great sunsets and occasionally adventure, particularly when we side-stepped the official sites to brave the wilderness. It also took us closer to snakes and bears than we sometimes cared for, so we bought a night indoors when we could. Surprisingly, it was the motels that produced the characters. </p> <p>Our budget kept us at the downmarket end of town, where ridiculously cheap deals were available. Better set-up travellers might have been enjoying firmer beds, extra towels and quieter air conditioning, but they were missing out on human interest. You don't meet itinerant harvesters with a life history like a Johnnie Cash song at the Holiday Inn. Nor do you come across a treasure hunter down to his last buck heading out for Wyoming to prospect a Pony Express station once sacked by the Sioux. </p> <p>Worst of all, we'd have missed the craggy Vietnam veteran who muscled his ancient Harley into Medicine Lodge out of the most spectacular deluge. With him was a Missouri teacher on a big yellow Honda. It rained six inches that night, and twisters stalked the prairie. As we sheltered behind the thin walls, the Vietnam vet recounted how that morning they had ridden over the snowy passes of Colorado: the teacher had to be in front of her class the next day or lose her job. They roared out into the rain before breakfast with 500 miles still to go. Roz and I had three months to find our way to San Francisco and back. Feeling vaguely guilty, we switched on The Weather Channel, brewed up on our tiny stove, lay in late and dreamed of California. </p> <p>There are many ways to travel America, but for the full experience, try throwing your leg over a bike. You'll understand the awesome heat, the bugs, the sheer scale of everything, while the unique motorcycle mix of vulnerability and raw power will never fail to fascinate the locals. Americans love Harley-Davidsons. Ride one westwards and you won't be alone for long. </p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong> </p> <p>Organising a motorcycle tour in the US can be accomplished in three ways:</p> <p><strong> Ship your own bike:</strong> From Southampton via Wallenius Lines to Baltimore costs \u00a3390 ride-on, ride-off, one-way, including UK port charges and Customs. You will have to pay locally in the US for port and Customs (around $100). Call Dockside Freight Services (02380 336644). Claridon Shipping (01375 656100) will arrange everything, including crating your bike for maximum safety. Three-week return freight to Sturgis, South Dakota, costs \u00a3750 plus riding insurance. </p> <p><strong> Hiring:</strong> various websites, including <a href=\"http://www.denverharleyrentals.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.denverharleyrentals.com</a> and Western States Motorcycle Rentals, <a href=\"http://www.members.aol.com/_ht_a/azmcrent\">www.members.aol.com/_ht_a/azmcrent</a>. Hiring costs around $800 per week ($550 for a 1200 Sportster), but there are a number of extras, including state tax and always two levels of insurance, of which you are well advised to choose \"the full monty\". Up to $1,500 deposit. </p> <p><strong> Buying and selling in the US:</strong> Far cheaper than renting, but make sure you can insure it. </p> <p><strong> Reading:</strong> </p> <p>United States on the Road is published by Insight Guides at \u00a317.99. </p> <p>Tom Cunliffe's book Good Vibrations - Coast to Coast by Harley is published by Summersdale at \u00a37.99. </p> <p> <strong>Travel special</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://travel.guardianunlimited.co.uk/feature/0,8806,449259,00.html\">No particular place to go?</a> Whether it's rafting in <a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/countries/indiv/0,7451,413555,00.html\">Sweden</a> or riding in a covered wagon in <a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/countries/indiv/0,7451,413572,00.html\">Wyoming</a>, travelling is not just the dull bit at the beginning and end of your holiday.

He looked for all the world like John Wayne, except that he rode a Yamaha trail bike instead of a horse. This open-handedness to travellers wraps around you like a blanket in rural America. Perhaps it's the novelty of a new face among people who live miles apart, but I prefer to think it dates from pre-TV times when casual visiting was an art form. We'd encountered it before in West Virginia, where we'd been rescued from the death throes of a hurricane. Sitting on the step of the local store-owner's cabin, we drank home-distilled whiskey and listened to stories from the proprietor and his family. Everyone on that lamplit porch could have earned a good living on the after-dinner speaking circuit. Tales of running moonshine to the Carolinas in all-American cars pursued by tobacco-chewing Feds vied with yarns of not-so-wily hunters trapped up trees with giant racoons scratching and biting them. In between staying with new friends, Roz and I slept under canvas or in motels. Camping offered great sunsets and occasionally adventure, particularly when we side-stepped the official sites to brave the wilderness. It also took us closer to snakes and bears than we sometimes cared for, so we bought a night indoors when we could. Surprisingly, it was the motels that produced the characters. Our budget kept us at the downmarket end of town, where ridiculously cheap deals were available. Better set-up travellers might have been enjoying firmer beds, extra towels and quieter air conditioning, but they were missing out on human interest. You don't meet itinerant harvesters with a life history like a Johnnie Cash song at the Holiday Inn. Nor do you come across a treasure hunter down to his last buck heading out for Wyoming to prospect a Pony Express station once sacked by the Sioux. Worst of all, we'd have missed the craggy Vietnam veteran who muscled his ancient Harley into Medicine Lodge out of the most spectacular deluge. With him was a Missouri teacher on a big yellow Honda. It rained six inches that night, and twisters stalked the prairie. As we sheltered behind the thin walls, the Vietnam vet recounted how that morning they had ridden over the snowy passes of Colorado: the teacher had to be in front of her class the next day or lose her job. They roared out into the rain before breakfast with 500 miles still to go. Roz and I had three months to find our way to San Francisco and back. Feeling vaguely guilty, we switched on The Weather Channel, brewed up on our tiny stove, lay in late and dreamed of California. There are many ways to travel America, but for the full experience, try throwing your leg over a bike. You'll understand the awesome heat, the bugs, the sheer scale of everything, while the unique motorcycle mix of vulnerability and raw power will never fail to fascinate the locals. Americans love Harley-Davidsons. Ride one westwards and you won't be alone for long. Way to go Organising a motorcycle tour in the US can be accomplished in three ways: Ship your own bike: From Southampton via Wallenius Lines to Baltimore costs \u00a3390 ride-on, ride-off, one-way, including UK port charges and Customs. You will have to pay locally in the US for port and Customs (around $100). Call Dockside Freight Services (02380 336644). Claridon Shipping (01375 656100) will arrange everything, including crating your bike for maximum safety. Three-week return freight to Sturgis, South Dakota, costs \u00a3750 plus riding insurance. Hiring: various websites, including www.denverharleyrentals.com and Western States Motorcycle Rentals, www.members.aol.com/_ht_a/azmcrent. Hiring costs around $800 per week ($550 for a 1200 Sportster), but there are a number of extras, including state tax and always two levels of insurance, of which you are well advised to choose \"the full monty\". Up to $1,500 deposit. Buying and selling in the US: Far cheaper than renting, but make sure you can insure it. Reading: United States on the Road is published by Insight Guides at \u00a317.99. Tom Cunliffe's book Good Vibrations - Coast to Coast by Harley is published by Summersdale at \u00a37.99. Travel special No particular place to go?

      "body": "<p>Forget what you've read. Travelling around India doesn't necessarily mean having to take the backpacking-on-a-budget route. Nor does it have to be the all-inclusive, pricey package. Those who've dreamed of visiting the land of maharajas may be encouraged to learn that there's a third way: the customised package. In other words, travel independently but let someone else do all the legwork. </p> <p>A customised package means you choose your itinerary, your accommodation and your means of transport. For me and my travelling companion, this was a 17-day tour of Rajasthan, staying in the most spectacular palaces and castles, with a chauffeur to ferry us around. </p> <p>Our original intention was indeed to go the backpacking route, relying on the Indian rail system and seeking out accommodation on arrival at each town. As we jetted off to Delhi, all we had booked for our three-week holiday was a couple of nights in the Lonely Planet-recommended Hotel 55. The rest was to be left to spontaneity. </p> <p>But on our very first day in Delhi, we walked right into a scam - there's one operating on every street corner for the unwary tourist - prompting us to change our plan. We were looking for the tourist information office, and were ushered into a building displaying the sign \"Tourist Information\" on the right street. But it turned out to be a travel agent; we only realised this afterwards, when we noticed several places claiming to be the official tourist information office. </p> <p>Nevertheless, it was the travel agent who first gave us the idea to devise our own package. He told us train travel was far from glamorous, and, on the more popular routes, we wouldn't get our first choice of trains. Rajasthan is a big place and some journeys can take 12 hours, so travelling in anything less than a first-class sleeper would mean arriving exhausted and irritable - and possibly minus our rucksacks. </p> <p>Had we thought of a chauffeur-driven car instead? We were quoted a price of \u00a3475, which seemed reasonable for a 17-day itinerary, inclusive of all fuel and taxes. </p> <p>We were only doing a small part of India, but we wanted to see the \"real India\", and we wanted to do it exhaustively. My biggest anxiety was not seeing it all, due to inadequate planning or inconvenient train timetables. Yet we were rather indignant at having fallen prey to a con trick. So we decided to get a quote from a reputable agent. </p> <p>Off we went to Cox &amp; Kings (\"seeing travellers around India since 1758\") and they undercut the first quote by \u00a375. In a burst of confident enthusiasm, and more than a little relief, we handed over our sketched-out itinerary, listing our choice of hotels (we pushed the boat out here), and left all the arrangements with them. At the end of the day, they had sorted it all out: a cream 1961 Ambassador car was due to pick us up from our hotel the following morning and transport us to the land of princes, Rajasthan. </p> <p>We had complete mobility, all hotels booked for us, an official guide laid on at each destination, entry to all the sights, plus the chauffeur's accommodation, fuel and taxes paid for up front. All for \u00a3800 each. </p> <p>It went like a dream. On our driving days, we set off in the cool of the morning, at 8am, travelled for between four to six hours, including a stop at some landmark temple, palace or fort en route, arriving at our hotel some time between noon and 2pm. Six hours in a car is not as bad as it sounds. The view from the window was endlessly fascinating, even in the desert: dusty villages, hilltop forts, wildlife, the fluorescent saris of Rajasthani women, garishly-customised lorries, camel carts, painted cows. And we made stops wherever we wanted. By train, we would have missed the 15th-century temples at Ranakpur and the beautifully-preserved ghost town of Fatehpur Sikri, the ertswhile capital of the Mughal empire. </p> <p>We stayed in the most exquisite hotels - often in the maharaja's palace complex. When the maharaja's palace was beyond our means, we stayed in the home of a family member of the maharaja, but on those occasions we ended up with the best room. And to satisfy our curiosity about the grander, more expensive palace in town, we booked ourselves in for dinner, thus allowing us to snoop around. </p> <p>We did a vast anticlockwise circuit out of Delhi. Our first stop was the village of Mandawa, in the Shakawati region renowned for its ornate \"havelis\", or mansions, built by wealthy merchants in the 19th century. Inside and out, the walls are illustrated with maharajas on elephant-back or more up-to-date transport, such as motor cars or the Wright Brothers' plane. The owners were keen to demonstrate that they were keeping up with the latest developments in the west. We stayed in the spectacular Mandawa Castle, with its labyrinthine staircases and battlements, and that evening dined under the stars in its vast candlelit garden courtyard. </p> <p>The next day we headed for Bikaner, a desert town in the north, with its magnificent fort and, in an outlying village, the infamous \"rat temple\". The rats that scurry everywhere are believed to be reincarnations of a holy woman, and are therefore sacred. We stayed at the Gajner Palace, an ornate 19th-century, red sandstone edifice on a lake, set in its own nature reserve. </p> <p>We continued deeper into the Thar desert until we reached the golden city of Jaisalmer, near the Pakistan border. Built from yellow sandstone, it's a pure Arabian Nights fantasy. It's also the camel capital of Rajasthan; everyone takes a camel safari here, and we were no exception. Our hotel, the Himmatgarh Palace, on a hill outside of town, afforded us a great view of the walled city rising dramatically out of the desert plain like a mirage. </p> <p>In Jodhpur, the Brahmins first painted their houses blue to differentiate themselves from the lower castes. Then everyone followed suit; now Jodhpur is known as the blue city. It has the most imposing mountain-top fort and the teeming Sardar bazaar, where we bought saffron, nutmeg and masala spices for our \"chai\". Our modest abode, the Ajit Bhawan, built by the maharaja for his younger brother, lies in the shadow of the grandiose Umaid Bhawan, possibly the most expensive hotel in India, where suites cost up to \u00a3700 a night. </p> <p>Not to be outdone by other cities, Udaipur has appointed itself the \"marble city\", a tranquil oasis with beautiful lakeside palaces. The Lake Palace Hotel, the one that appears to float on the lake, was used for a James Bond film location. Alas, it's now popularly known as the Octopussy Hotel, and the film gets shown every night somewhere in town. We dined there one evening, picked up by the palace boat at sunset, though we stayed in the Shiv Niwas Palace, neighbours of the maharana (a rank even higher than maharaja). </p> <p>From one lakeside location to another: to Pushkar, top place of pilgrimage for Hindus, its sacred lake surrounded by temples, with steps, or \"ghats\", leading down to the water's edge. A respite from sightseeing, there was little to do here except sit on the palm terrace of the Pushkar Palace and gaze out on to the lake, watch people bathe, and listen to the drums and chanting drifting across the water from the temples opposite. </p> <p>The capital of Rajasthan, Jaipur, is the pink city. Built from red sandstone in the 18th century, this rectangular walled city was designed on a grid - remarkable for its time. Though our hotel, the Alsisar Haveli, enjoyed a busy city-centre location, it was remarkably tranquil in its lush garden setting. One of the attractions of Jaipur is the magnificent Amber Fort, nestling in the mountains high above the city. Most tourists complete the climb by elephant, but we were sated with our camel ride of a few days previous. Besides, there's no shade on an elephant in 35-degree heat. </p> <p>It's quite fair to say that Agra is the most polluted of cities, but it is home to that wonder of the world, the Taj Mahal. It has, however, become a victim of its own success: queues form for a picture on the \"Diana seat\". The government takes advantage of its popularity: rickshaws, taxis and guides were going on strike that weekend, protesting at the doubling of entrance charges to R1,000 - more than \u00a315. No longer in Rajasthan, alas, and heritage hotels being thin on the ground, we chose the Plaza on the basis of its proximity to the Taj - a mere 10-minute walk away. </p> <p>We got back to Delhi in time for Diwali, the festival of lights honouring the goddess of prosperity, Lakshmi. It's the Hindu equivalent of Christmas - all tinsel garlands, fairy lights, an exchange of presents and sweetmeats - with the bonus of fireworks. That day, we roamed the narrow, dusty streets and the maze of bazaars, each one with its own speciality: silks, spices, homeware, electrical goods, tailoring. </p> <p>Seventeen days previously, we had started out from New Delhi, the heart of which is the Lutyens-designed Connaught Place - a circular park circumscribed by a vast colonnade of white stucco buildings. We ended our tour in Old Delhi, just north of the new town, and on our last night stayed at the Oberoi Maidens, an elegant colonial building from where, coincidentally, Lutyens had planned his New Delhi. The circle was complete. </p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p>Our customised itinerary cost \u00a3800pp through Cox &amp; Kings, Delhi (011 332 0067). Although we didn't get a breakdown of costs, if we allow \u00a3400 as quoted for the driver, his accommodation and fuel, \u00a360 for six city guides, and \u00a360 for entrance fees, our accommodation worked out at an average of \u00a332 each a night, including breakfast. Not bad considering that the most expensive hotel we stayed in was advertising its rooms at \u00a390 a night, plus \"luxury tax\" (which can add up to 23% to the bill), and the cheapest hotel at \u00a345 per night, plus tax. </p> <p>We flew BA for \u00a3500, bought through Trailfinders (020-7628 7628). To book the same tailor-made tour through Cox &amp; Kings in London (020-7873 5006) would cost \u00a31,790pp, including international flights, chauffer-driven car and based on room-only twin share accommodation. </p> <p>Cox &amp; Kings also offers a 17-day group tour of Rajasthan, called Forts &amp; Palaces of Rajputana, visiting Delhi, Gwalior, Agra, Jaipur, Bikaner, Jaisalmer, Manvar, Jodhpur, Rohet, Udaipur and Mumbai. Prices start from \u00a31,495 per person, including international flights, twin share accommodation, meals as per the itinerary and transfers. </p> <p>There are, of course, plenty of other agents in Delhi able to organise such a trip, including Abercrombie &amp; Kent (011 643 6207), Sita World Travel (011 331 1133) or Travel Corporation of India (011 331 5834). </p> <p>The obligatory six-month multiple-entry visa to India costs \u00a320.

      "body": "<p>It's not yet eight in the morning, and I'm having my first glass of Guinness. I've already been up almost three hours, toured through the backstreets where no curtain was yet drawn, trespassed on building sites before the foreman arrived, crossed the Liffey twice, toured Dublin Castle, and had a very hearty breakfast. Now my confused body clock was telling me that I was ready to down the first drink of the day. </p> <p>This day had begun far too early, at 5.30am, when we'd arranged to meet up with Damien O'Tuama, bike enthusiast and erstwhile cycling campaigner, who takes the foolish, the masochistic and the odd insomniac on a leisurely pedal around Dublin as the light rises over the Liffey. Now we were near the end of our tour, and my fellow travellers were saddled out and pedal pushed. Other drinkers in Slattery's, the early morning bar, had not seen their beds for even longer than me. Some had been up all night, coming straight from the clubs, and it showed. </p> <p>You certainly see a different Dublin on a dawn bike tour. Absolutely nothing listed as a must-see in your guidebook is open. You cannot visit the Book of Kells, the Guinness Hopstore, the James Joyce Centre or Kilmainham Gaol. None of them open until 9.30am, hours after we were up. </p> <p>Nor can you go inside Dublin Castle (opens 10am), and stroll through the state apartments and chapel royal. Yet you can see the heart of government as few tourists ever do. We cycled past the security guard at the Castle gate with a royal wave, whizzed around the courtyard, and leant our Raleigh Pioneers up against a wall sitting on grass that, just a few hours later, tourists would be prevented from sitting on. The half moon was still hovering over the 13th-century Record Tower. </p> <p>We were like a travelling show, the tall flags on the back of our bikes flapping, and such a rare sight at this unearthly hour, that everyone greeted us with a laugh. No one is worried about a small gaggle of early morning cyclists. We could have got in anywhere. </p> <p>The drawbacks of setting the alarm clock so early were soon outweighed by the benefits of seeing a city literally in a light few people have seen. We experienced a Dublin still yawning, emerging from the night. Only the tramps were beginning to turn, woken by the early sun lighting the shelter of the shop doorways. There were few long shadows like ours on the streets. There was just the odd person staggering about, trying to find their way home, as if the capital were inhabited by members of Monty Python's Ministry of Silly Walks. Taxis ferried the last clubbers, and first buses carried office cleaners and construction workers. Only the pigeons scattered for us, and then reluctantly. </p> <p>Without traffic jams and Dublin's prolific crowds to contend with, your mental map of the city shifts. We rode three abreast up O'Connell Street, the city's main thoroughfare. The quietness let other sounds and senses seep in. By the time we reached the 24-hour Guinness brewery, my sense of smell was so heightened that the aroma in the surrounding air was enough to make me feel already drunk. </p> <p>Just a couple of hundred yards away, the patients of St Patrick's psychiatric hospital, founded in 1745 from money bequeathed by Jonathon Swift, author of Gulliver's Travels, hadn't yet been given their breakfast. Most of the early inmates were alcoholics - incarcerated right next door to what was once the world's biggest brewery. An ambulance siren from several miles away pierced the empty air. </p> <p>By the time we reach the Dublin Corporation Victorian Fruit Market, I was so sensually heightened I felt as if I was being assaulted by the scent from the flowers. The grinding of the forklift trucks was so piercing it was almost painful. </p> <p>Markets are men's business, from very young boys to very old codgers. Fresh faced and pimply young bucks pushed trolleys piled with paper sacks of Irish tatties. Their dads arranged the cabbages. Most of the fruit and vegetables eaten by the Irish nation pass through the Victorian Fruit Market. </p> <p>At least we were in tune with this place. Breakfast at 8am was the market traders' equivalent of lunchtime, when they had the main meal of the day. The menu at Paddy's Place (opens 6am), the market caf\u00e9, has survived a decade onslaught of nouvelle cuisine and sun-dried tomato products unscathed. It offers black pudding, white pudding, rashers and anything else that is saturated in animal fat. It was delicious, washed down by watery tea or milky coffee. By the time we left, several pounds heavier, Paddy's Place was already beginning to close. </p> <p>It must have burned up at least 10 calories of my double fried egg to reach Slattery's in Capel Street, Dublin's notorious traditional early house. There were bouncers on the door from seven in the morning - it was that kind of place. There was standing room only inside, and you're never out of close bodily contact with other drinkers - nurses working late shifts, clubbers who need a pint before they go to bed, and some of the market lads without their dads. </p> <p>Soon, you're not only inevitably pressed up against but also in deep semi-coherent conversation with someone. Cruelly, pub mirrors lined the old bar so it was difficult not to be caught out by your own reflection at a time when none of us were looking our best. The girl with her pelvic bone protruding into my back whispered hoarsely in my ear that she hadn't made it home from the night before, then added, \"The drummer from Thin Lizzy plays upstairs some nights.\" It was a very diverse crowd with only one thing in common: Everyone was drunk. And remember; it wasn't yet nine in the morning. </p> <p>We rode in a flock back over the Liffey, belting out Molly Malone. Damien was eloquent on the benefits of being an early morning cyclist. \"You can potter up a certain street if you see something interesting,\" he said. \"You couldn't ask a coach driver - 'Hey, hang on a minute, I just want to look up there.' You can be part of everything on a bike.\" </p> <p>Back at our hotel, late risers were stumbling down to breakfast. I felt sorry for them. The best part of the day had already passed.

How much you pay depends as much on where you get it from, as how much of a risk you are. </p> <p>Fifty per cent of people buy insurance from the organisation where they booked their holiday. But travel agents and tour operators charge way over the odds, according to the latest Holiday Which? report. For example, cover for a two-week holiday in Europe with Going Places costs \u00a340.65, whereas TravelPlan Direct is four times cheaper, charging only \u00a310 to cover a two-week holiday in Europe. \"Be prepared to shop around for holiday insurance which can deliver real savings,\" says Patricia Yates, editor of Holiday Which? </p> <p>Specialist travel insurance providers consistently offer better deals than those offered by the high street travel agents.

Fifty per cent of people buy insurance from the organisation where they booked their holiday. But travel agents and tour operators charge way over the odds, according to the latest Holiday Which? report. For example, cover for a two-week holiday in Europe with Going Places costs \u00a340.65, whereas TravelPlan Direct is four times cheaper, charging only \u00a310 to cover a two-week holiday in Europe. \"Be prepared to shop around for holiday insurance which can deliver real savings,\" says Patricia Yates, editor of Holiday Which? Specialist travel insurance providers consistently offer better deals than those offered by the high street travel agents.

      "body": "<p>We boarded the train in Moscow as the sun was setting. Our cabin was a vision of faded grandeur: heavy mirrors, old light fittings and kitsch landscape prints. Charlotte and I sat on our beds and shared a beer as we watched Moscow slipping away. This was to be our home for the next four nights. The greatest train journey in the world was, so far, living up to expectations. </p> <p>\"Hi guys,\" said a hearty New Zealander from the next-door cabin. \"I'm Rachel.\" Her friend appeared. \"And I'm Rachel,\" she added. The Rachels were going to be our companions all the way through to Beijing. Luckily, we liked them. </p> <p>We had the luxury of a two-berth cabin, and a carriage attendant who vacuumed and dusted every day and made sure we were back on board in time when the train stopped. On the first night, we puzzled over how to get any water from the taps, and ended up brushing our teeth in mineral water. We later discovered that there is a piece of metal poking down behind the tap, and that this has to be pushed up, an eccentric method of supplying water, but it worked. </p> <p>This was proper train travel. Railtrack wasn't involved, the timetable was gospel, and, if there were any leaves on the line, they didn't pose a problem. We drifted off to sleep chugging through western Russia, and woke up still chugging through western Russia. Outside, smoke curled from the chimneys of little houses surrounded by birch trees. </p> <p>We sat, with the Rachels, in the restaurant car, in which the food is always provided by the country you're in at the time, resulting in meagre rations in Mongolia and multi-coursed feasts in China. We drank Baltika beer. We read books. At the stations, we got out to stretch our legs. </p> <p>During this first and longest stretch of 5,191km, between Moscow and Siberia, we moved officially from Europe into Asia. We saw the underwhelming Ural mountains, and passed within 375 miles of the Tungunska River, where a massive explosion occurred in 1908. This has been variously blamed on an atomic spaceship, a mini-black hole and an asteroid collision. </p> <p>We settled into a peaceful train life, broken only by an occasional vigorous walk round a platform in a remote town, smiling at local people whose lives we could barely begin to imagine. Between us, the passengers drank the bar dry of Baltika 3, the normal lager, and had to move on to Baltika 9, which is more like a spirit. We made plenty of friends after that. </p> <p>Then suddenly, we were in Irkutsk, the self-styled \"Paris of Eastern Siberia\". We had crossed five time zones in four days, resulting in the unusual phenomenon of train lag. </p> <p>The boulevards may feel slightly Parisian, but there is no escaping the fact that this is Russia. Imposing Stalinist edifices cast their shadows over white Orthodox churches with golden onion domes. Lenin stood with a raised hand in a square. \"He wants a taxi\", a local explained. </p> <p>Charlotte and I looked at the monument to the completion of the railway, admired a bust of Yuri Gagarin, nodded curtly to some hideous art in the museum, and decided we needed to sit down. </p> <p>\"What do you think that means?\" Charlotte asked, pointing to a piece of paper on a park bench. \"It can't be anything important,\" I decided. Unfortunately, it meant \"wet paint\" and those trousers stayed in Siberia. </p> <p>From Irkutsk, it's not much more than an hour's drive through snowy birch forests to Listvyanka, a village on the shores of Lake Baikal. From the moment we walked into Rita's house, and saw her table laden down with our second breakfast, we knew we were somewhere special. </p> <p>Lake Baikal glimmered in the sunlight at the end of the street. The air was crystal clear, the sky deep blue. We walked on the shores, caught a boat, and vowed to come back for longer. </p> <p>We discovered that Siberian loos are at the end of the garden, even though it is minus 30 degrees centigrade on winter nights. Stranger still, they don't have showers or baths, but saunas. Charlotte and I were sent into the sauna together, and instructed to hit each other with birch twigs. </p> <p>Rita's table creaked under the weight of her gorgeous food four times a day. \"I like it when tourists eat a lot,\" she told us pointedly, looking at our leftovers. We talked to her, through Lida, our guide, about communism and capitalism, about Chechnya and the Russian soul. We wanted to live with her forever. </p> <p>Our last night in Listvyanka was Orthodox Easter. Before midnight mass, we nipped out for a drink in the Baikal bar by the lake. \"We'll just have one vodka,\" we told each other, sensibly. By the time we staggered to the church, chatting amiably to everyone, we had consumed more alcohol units than my doctor believes I drink in a week, and had learned lots more Russian. </p> <p>The train onward to Mongolia served as a drying-out clinic. The Rachels spent the entire day lying prostate and clutching their heads. When we pulled in to Ulan Baatar, the platform was heaving with people. They had come to buy from the traders whose boxes clogged the whole train as it crossed Siberia, and which suddenly vanished as soon as we reached customs. </p> <p>The final train, which took us to China, stopped, considerately, at a station situated within the Great Wall, so we could take photos. That left two days in Beijing before we flew home. The whole trip lasted just over two weeks, and we came back feeling that we'd been away for months. </p> <p><strong> Way to go</strong></p> <p> Bridge the World (0870 444 7474, <a href=\"http://www.bridgetheworld.com\">www.bridgetheworld.com</a>) organises a 15-day Trans-Siberian trip for \u00a31,263pp for departures until June 30. </p> <p>The price includes 14 nights' accommodation, including two nights in Moscow (three-star hotel or family), village stay in Baikal, an overnight stay with a family in Irkutsk and two nights at a Mongolian Ger Camp on the Steppe. </p> <p>The price also includes all train travel (second class/four berth), flights from London Heathrow to Moscow and Beijing to London, plus various meals and excursions.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Emily Barr's novel Backpack is published by Headline at \u00a35.99</p> <p><strong>Travel special</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://travel.guardianunlimited.co.uk/feature/0,8806,449259,00.html\">No particular place to go?</a> Whether it's rafting in <a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/countries/indiv/0,7451,413555,00.html\">Sweden</a> or riding in a covered wagon in <a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/countries/indiv/0,7451,413572,00.html\">Wyoming</a>, travelling is not just the dull bit at the beginning and end of your holiday.

Railtrack wasn't involved, the timetable was gospel, and, if there were any leaves on the line, they didn't pose a problem. We drifted off to sleep chugging through western Russia, and woke up still chugging through western Russia. Outside, smoke curled from the chimneys of little houses surrounded by birch trees. We sat, with the Rachels, in the restaurant car, in which the food is always provided by the country you're in at the time, resulting in meagre rations in Mongolia and multi-coursed feasts in China. We drank Baltika beer. We read books. At the stations, we got out to stretch our legs. During this first and longest stretch of 5,191km, between Moscow and Siberia, we moved officially from Europe into Asia. We saw the underwhelming Ural mountains, and passed within 375 miles of the Tungunska River, where a massive explosion occurred in 1908. This has been variously blamed on an atomic spaceship, a mini-black hole and an asteroid collision. We settled into a peaceful train life, broken only by an occasional vigorous walk round a platform in a remote town, smiling at local people whose lives we could barely begin to imagine. Between us, the passengers drank the bar dry of Baltika 3, the normal lager, and had to move on to Baltika 9, which is more like a spirit. We made plenty of friends after that. Then suddenly, we were in Irkutsk, the self-styled \"Paris of Eastern Siberia\". We had crossed five time zones in four days, resulting in the unusual phenomenon of train lag. The boulevards may feel slightly Parisian, but there is no escaping the fact that this is Russia. Imposing Stalinist edifices cast their shadows over white Orthodox churches with golden onion domes. Lenin stood with a raised hand in a square. \"He wants a taxi\", a local explained. Charlotte and I looked at the monument to the completion of the railway, admired a bust of Yuri Gagarin, nodded curtly to some hideous art in the museum, and decided we needed to sit down. \"What do you think that means?\" Charlotte asked, pointing to a piece of paper on a park bench. \"It can't be anything important,\" I decided. Unfortunately, it meant \"wet paint\" and those trousers stayed in Siberia. From Irkutsk, it's not much more than an hour's drive through snowy birch forests to Listvyanka, a village on the shores of Lake Baikal. From the moment we walked into Rita's house, and saw her table laden down with our second breakfast, we knew we were somewhere special. Lake Baikal glimmered in the sunlight at the end of the street. The air was crystal clear, the sky deep blue. We walked on the shores, caught a boat, and vowed to come back for longer. We discovered that Siberian loos are at the end of the garden, even though it is minus 30 degrees centigrade on winter nights. Stranger still, they don't have showers or baths, but saunas. Charlotte and I were sent into the sauna together, and instructed to hit each other with birch twigs. Rita's table creaked under the weight of her gorgeous food four times a day. \"I like it when tourists eat a lot,\" she told us pointedly, looking at our leftovers. We talked to her, through Lida, our guide, about communism and capitalism, about Chechnya and the Russian soul. We wanted to live with her forever. Our last night in Listvyanka was Orthodox Easter. Before midnight mass, we nipped out for a drink in the Baikal bar by the lake. \"We'll just have one vodka,\" we told each other, sensibly. By the time we staggered to the church, chatting amiably to everyone, we had consumed more alcohol units than my doctor believes I drink in a week, and had learned lots more Russian. The train onward to Mongolia served as a drying-out clinic. The Rachels spent the entire day lying prostate and clutching their heads. When we pulled in to Ulan Baatar, the platform was heaving with people. They had come to buy from the traders whose boxes clogged the whole train as it crossed Siberia, and which suddenly vanished as soon as we reached customs. The final train, which took us to China, stopped, considerately, at a station situated within the Great Wall, so we could take photos. That left two days in Beijing before we flew home. The whole trip lasted just over two weeks, and we came back feeling that we'd been away for months. Way to go Bridge the World (0870 444 7474, www.bridgetheworld.com) organises a 15-day Trans-Siberian trip for \u00a31,263pp for departures until June 30. The price includes 14 nights' accommodation, including two nights in Moscow (three-star hotel or family), village stay in Baikal, an overnight stay with a family in Irkutsk and two nights at a Mongolian Ger Camp on the Steppe. The price also includes all train travel (second class/four berth), flights from London Heathrow to Moscow and Beijing to London, plus various meals and excursions. \u00b7 Emily Barr's novel Backpack is published by Headline at \u00a35.99 Travel special No particular place to go?

      "body": "<p>\"Why has nature put this terrible surface here to scare me?\" is the reaction of most intermediate skiers when confronted with ice. It may seem that skis were designed to handle snow, whereas ice-skates are implements better suited to coping with ice. But with the right technique (and ski preparation), a pair of planks can help you deal with the slippery stuff just as well as any skates. </p> <p>It's important to realise that there are different grades of ice. If the surface is rock-hard, but has a matt, rather than a shiny texture, it is usually possible to get a fair amount of grip, given some astute angling of the body, and a sharp enough pair of edges. Most recreational skiers would call this \"ice\", but racers, who are used to dealing with hard surfaces, refer to this type of snow as \"hard and grippy\". </p> <p>On the other hand, if the surface is beginning to show a shiny appearance, then we can truly begin to talk about ice proper. And if it starts to get noticeably darker than the snow around it, it becomes a case of the dreaded \"blue ice\". </p> <p>Ice is not created instantly. It evolves from snow under certain conditions. When snow crystals originally fall from the sky, they pile together loosely, because of their spiky shapes. This is the cause of the lovely \"fluffy\" texture of fresh powder snow. As skiers and piste-bashers scrape over the snow, day after day, they gradually break down the crystals, and the snow particles start to pack together more compactly - this usually produces snow of the \"hard and grippy\" variety. </p> <p>As long as the air stays cold, this is as bad as things get. But if the snow starts to melt, due to warm sunshine or rain, the amount of water between the particles increases. While it stays warm, the snow will be soft, heavy and slushy. But once the temperature drops, usually because of a clear, cold night, the water freezes, and binds the snow particles together in a solid layer. The wetter the snow during the afternoon, the worse the ice will be the next morning. The direction of each slope, relative to the sun, can make a huge difference to this \"melt/freeze cycle\" effect. In the northern hemisphere, south-facing slopes will always suffer the worst. </p> <p>So now we know how it's formed, but how do you ski it? If the ice merely occurs in patches, the best tactic is to look ahead, and try to turn on the areas of loose snow. But it's important to maintain a good traverse position, angling your knees and hips towards the uphill side, to keep your skis tilted on to their uphill edges. Keep your upper body facing downhill and leaning out over your downhill ski. As long as your skis are carving (ie tracking along their edges rather than skidding sideways), and they're tilted over on to a sufficient angle, they'll be able to slice across almost anything. </p> <p>It's a different kettle of fish, if you have to deal with a solid sheet of ice, such as you may find on a clear April morning on the lower slopes. The key is to increase the pressure on to your edge as you progress around the turn. Extra downward pressure will help your ski to grip, just as the \"downforce\" on Formula One cars helps them to stay on track around bends. You need to increase that pressure during each turn, by gradually sinking into a lower and lower position to counteract the centrifugal and gravitational forces which build up towards the end of each turn - they're trying to stop you finishing off your turn, because they're always pulling you down the hill. </p> <p>The lower, more aggressive position will undoubtedly be more tiring; that's why racers, who almost always race on ice, have to be incredibly strong and fit. But it will give you more control. You'll also need to keep your feet wider apart, for better balance, and to give yourself room to angle your outside knee inwards to achieve that extreme edge angle with the outside ski. </p> <p>If the terrain is flat enough, you'll want to be carving your entire turns. But pure carving will not kill off any speed; on steeper slopes you'll have to be content with pivoting your skis around in a controlled skid, and getting them to carve the traverses at the end of each turn, providing a stable base from which to initiate the next turn. </p> <p>And never, ever put any weight on your inside ski. Almost all the pressure should be acting through the outside ski, around each turn. That means that if your outside ski skids, your inside ski will be there to \"save\" you. If you habitually turn on your inside ski, once it skids you'll have nowhere to go but on your backside. </p> <p>Good ski preparation will also help. Most expert skiers rate the quality of their edge preparation as more important than base waxing, when it comes to enjoying their turns. Keep your edges sharp, either by regular servicing, or ideally by learning to file them yourself. If you really want extra grip, try \"bevelling\" them; that means filing them into an 88-degree angle instead of 90. This may not sound much, but it makes an appreciable difference; racers always bevel their skis. </p> <p>Whenever you're confronted with ice, you must be more aggressive. Think about dominating it, driving that ski edge into it, rather than letting it dominate you.

The exhilaration continues as you go past 50 and 60, and your terror rises with the speed. Then a curve appears and you have a moment when you forget how the brakes work before your instructor buzzes in your ear and talks you gently through it. </p> <p>Ten minutes later, and we are turning off the A470 between Rhayader and Llangurig to the caravan that houses Marie's Roadside Caf\u00e9. We amble in, order tea and bacon-and-egg sandwiches with brown sauce, take off our leathers and relax. We have a chat with the other two customers about bikes as they stick their faces outside to admire my Harley Sportster and Toby's Fat Boy. The conversation, about doubles and triples and torque, is unintelligible to me, but for the first time I feel like a biker. </p> <p>Until earlier that week, I had been a lapsed 47-year-old scooter commuter. Now I was attempting to gain a full motorbike licence in six days from scratch on an all-American dream bike through a course at Rider's Edge in Builth Wells. </p> <p>It was not easy and, for a lot of the time, extremely hard work, as from 9.30am until 4.30pm we learned the rudimentary rules of the road. It is much more tiring than learning to drive a car and by the end of an hour of going around Llandrindod Wells, practising hill starts, u-turns and concentrating hard on staying upright and alive, we were physically and mentally knackered. </p> <p>The first two days were spent gaining a certificate of basic training (CBT), which allows you to drive a small bike with L plates on a public road, or allows you out with an instructor on a bike of 250cc-plus. Rider's Edge is based in the grounds of the Royal Welsh Show at Builth Wells, so driving around the private roads on a small bike was a perfect way to learn the basics. And when it rained, we could always practise in some of the big animal sheds built for the agricultural show. </p> <p>After two days, with a bit of experience out on the real roads, an instructor giving instructions through an ear-piece, all three of us on the course gained our CBT. Then we were on to the big ones - those chrome monsters of cinematic folklore to males of my generation. </p> <p>They are heavy, especially at first, but after weaving in and out of cones and stopping and starting and doing it all over again and again, we were out on the road. The scenery of mid-Wales, around the Brecon Beacons, makes a wonderful backdrop for riding, although concentration means you do not see as much of it as you would like. The push to drill in the rudiments in town, and get miles under our belts in the country was relentless. </p> <p>We spent our evenings in the Griffin Inn, just down the beautiful Wye Valley from Builth Wells. Lovely beer and country cooking of local produce helped make it a welcome place to stay. </p> <p>But it could not prevent us from feeling nervous as our test, in nearby Llandridod Wells, approached. I was not alone in not sleeping a wink the night before. At that stage, it felt anything like a holiday. </p> <p>But I passed the test and felt brilliant (and if I had failed, Rider's Edge would have given free lessons until a pass was achieved). And riding the bike felt wonderful - if still a little frightening. </p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>Rider's Edge (01982 551331) runs a five-day course, with the sixth day for your test, for \u00a31,098.

He imported this tradition to Britain and established the portrait as the British art par excellence, his ability to evoke character echoed by painters as diverse as Hogarth and Gainsborough.

Last week, on the anniversary of the Gulf war, she infuriated Major by claiming that if she'd remained in power, the allied forces would have carried on into Baghdad and removed Saddam Hussein. Yes, she was always overruling American presidents on military operations. It's good to hear her come out with this nonsense just to be reminded how completely loony, awful, self-deceiving and wrong she always was.

Just as Luke Skywalker discovers that he is the son of Darth Vader, and Buzz Lightyear's father is the evil Emperor Zorg, so Tony Blair is the political offspring of the Iron Lady. He may be the antithesis of her bigoted, confrontational xenophobia but without Thatcher, Prime Minister Blair would not exist. Her destruction of the labour movement gave rise to New Labour which her Conservative successors now find so unassailable.

      "body": "<p>Keith Vaz, the minister for Europe whose political future was in Sir Anthony Hammond's hands after allegations that he had passed secret information to the Hinduja brothers, was in the clear last night. The report found there was \"nothing improper\" in his contacts with the Home Office or his activities within the Foreign Office.</p> <p>Mr Vaz, who on Monday faces the publication of a separate inquiry by the standards and privileges committee into charges relating to constituency matters, welcomed the report's findings. \"I am pleased with the conclusions that he has reached. He makes clear that he has found nothing improper in relation to me.\"</p> <p>In the wake of Peter Mandelson's resignation, the Europe minister faced increasingly serious allegations which some of his friends felt were racist in their inspiration. He was accused of using his position at the Foreign Office to pass sensitive information to the Hindujas about avoiding extradition to India to face questioning over the Bofors bribery allegations.</p> <p>He was also accused of putting pressure on the Home Office to grant the Hindujas citizenship and of signing letters to Mr Mandelson and Tony Blair which had been drafted by the Hinduja brothers.</p> <p>The Hammond report - which comments on Mr Vaz's \"open and frank\" response to questions - specifically rules out any involvement by him in the Hinduja brothers attempts to avoid extradition.</p> <p>Sir Anthony says that Mr Vaz as a leading member of the Asian community, had an unusual role which involved him representing people who were not his constituents. He came to know the Hindujas well and first wrote to the Home Office about their naturalisation applications in 1993 after they had been rejected because they spent too much time out of the country.</p> <p>His interest was not only in their naturalisation applications. He also became involved in a millennium project they were backing in Peterborough which Mr Vaz suggested as an idea for the dome itself in a letter to Mr Mandelson, then dome minister.</p> <p>On the charge that Mr Vaz \"topped and tailed\" letters drafted by the Hindujas, Sir Anthony accepted Mr Vaz's explanation that if it happened it was in relation to the millennium project and would have been done by a member of his staff. \"I do not regard this as a matter of any great significance,\" Sir Anthony reports.</p> <p>Mr Vaz still has to face the findings of a second inquiry into his conduct as a backbench MP by the privileges committee.

      "bodyText": "Keith Vaz, the minister for Europe whose political future was in Sir Anthony Hammond's hands after allegations that he had passed secret information to the Hinduja brothers, was in the clear last night. The report found there was \"nothing improper\" in his contacts with the Home Office or his activities within the Foreign Office. Mr Vaz, who on Monday faces the publication of a separate inquiry by the standards and privileges committee into charges relating to constituency matters, welcomed the report's findings. \"I am pleased with the conclusions that he has reached. He makes clear that he has found nothing improper in relation to me.\" In the wake of Peter Mandelson's resignation, the Europe minister faced increasingly serious allegations which some of his friends felt were racist in their inspiration. He was accused of using his position at the Foreign Office to pass sensitive information to the Hindujas about avoiding extradition to India to face questioning over the Bofors bribery allegations. He was also accused of putting pressure on the Home Office to grant the Hindujas citizenship and of signing letters to Mr Mandelson and Tony Blair which had been drafted by the Hinduja brothers. The Hammond report - which comments on Mr Vaz's \"open and frank\" response to questions - specifically rules out any involvement by him in the Hinduja brothers attempts to avoid extradition. Sir Anthony says that Mr Vaz as a leading member of the Asian community, had an unusual role which involved him representing people who were not his constituents. He came to know the Hindujas well and first wrote to the Home Office about their naturalisation applications in 1993 after they had been rejected because they spent too much time out of the country. His interest was not only in their naturalisation applications. He also became involved in a millennium project they were backing in Peterborough which Mr Vaz suggested as an idea for the dome itself in a letter to Mr Mandelson, then dome minister. On the charge that Mr Vaz \"topped and tailed\" letters drafted by the Hindujas, Sir Anthony accepted Mr Vaz's explanation that if it happened it was in relation to the millennium project and would have been done by a member of his staff. \"I do not regard this as a matter of any great significance,\" Sir Anthony reports. Mr Vaz still has to face the findings of a second inquiry into his conduct as a backbench MP by the privileges committee. Mr Vaz is said to have accepted two donations in the early 1990s, each of under \u00a3500, for his constituency from a City solicitor Sarosh Zaiwalla who reportedly told the Guardian that he had no idea he had been recommended for an honour by Mr Vaz. The Vaz case may be a footnote to the Mandelson affair but it raises wider issues. Some members of the Asian community feel there is a need for more formal representation of their interests - something along the lines of the Jewish Board of Deputies. They argue that it could ease the pressure on people like Mr Vaz.

For the Home Office's own former chief lawyer has an answer, however implausible, to every uncomfortable incident he feels he has to record.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Hammond concedes there was indeed \"intelligence material\" about the controversial and high-profile Indian businessmen brothers at the centre of allegations of corruption in a major arms deal. Disturbingly, he concedes that this MI6 intelligence which he acknowledges to be relevant, mysteriously escaped the attention of the Home Office, the agency responsible for granting citizenship.</p> <p>Yet, astonishingly, he finishes up by suggesting that even if it had not, it would not have made any difference.</p> <p>Downing Street is, of course, right to fear the MI6 material. Despite Hammond's staggeringly complacent comments, it goes to the heart of the really crucial outstanding issue - the allegation that Mandelson is still lying in the impression he gives about what he knew at relevant times of those major bribery accusations against the Hindujas, while he was merrily taking their dome money and commending their passport applications.</p> <p>The MI6 files also raise serious questions about the judgment of senior cabinet ministers, all of whom also regularly receive intelligence reports. Hammond conveniently ignores this.</p> <p>With the masterfully calculated insouciance of someone well-versed in Whitehall culture, he says the Secret Intelligence Service - MI6 - accumulated \"a certain amount of intelligence\" on the Hindujas which it would \"not be appropriate\" to describe in detail. He concedes the material did \"raise the possibility\" that the Hindujas had been involved in \"dubious practices\" in some cases amounting to \"illegal activities\".</p> <p>Yet none of this intelligence was passed to the Home Office. Why not? Because it was collected \"in response to a request in a different context\", says Hammond. Only beneath the surface does his report hint at another explanation - the Hinduja brothers were becoming so important to the dome project that both Home Office officials and Mandelson either ignored or played down possible MI5 and MI6 concerns .</p> <p>MI5, explains Hammond, is concerned only with Britain's \"national security\" and allegations of corruption in India by prominent businessmen seeking British citizenship had nothing to do with that. But wouldn't the MI6 intelligence have been relevant to the test of \"being of good character\" enshrined in the British nationality act?</p> <p>Certainly, says Hammond. Indeed, he goes further. Since it was such an \"important and sensitive\" question, the home secretary would have had to be consulted if the Home Office had ever seen the files. But it does not matter - the intelligence would \"probably\" not have made any difference because of its \"speculative and inconclusive nature\".</p> <p>This is another artful choice of phrase. Hammond knows perfectly well MI6 reports never contain \"conclusions\" as such - they simply provide information, sometimes with references to the reliability of sources, for ministers to act on. This was the mistake made by Ann Widdecombe in January when, in an attempt to embarrass the government, she asked Hammond to investigate claims that MI6 advised that SP Hinduja's application for British nationality should be blocked.</p> <p>Asked by Andrew Marr, the BBC's political editor in January whether he was aware of the Bofors case when he was inquiring about the Hindujas' British citizenship, Mandelson replied: \"I didn't have any knowledge of that, no. All I know is that they volunteered to assist in the underwriting of the costs of that zone in the dome.\"</p> <p>But Hammond himself now admits these intelligence reports were seen by Mandelson in October or November 1998, and that he went ahead regardless with the acceptance of \u00a31m of Hinduja sponsorship money. Mandelson recklessly decided to discount the danger of adverse publicity if the truth came out.</p> <p>Behind the scenes another department, the Foreign Office, was, like MI6, under no illusions. In 1996, Caroline Elmes of the FO's south Asian department, told Andrew Walmsley, director of the Home Office's nationality division, about the Indian government's criminal investigation into the Bofors arms deal - a scandal which had featured prominently in media there for more than a decade. \"Given the activism of the Indian courts,\" she warned, \"it is conceivable that the case could come alight.\"</p> <p>She gave a warning in language remarkably strong for the FO that \"at the very least the Hinduja brothers can be said to have sailed close to the wind in building their business empire\".</p> <p>Ministers, as the Scott report into the \"arms-to-Iraq\" affair so amply demonstrated, seem to have little time for intelligence reports. In its latest annual report, the parliamentary intelligence and security committee noted that the cabinet committee on the intelligence services had not met since 1995.</p> <p>Yet of course ministers did not in fact need any secret intelligence to know what the Hindujas were up to. Indian investigators became increasingly convinced that the brothers' request for British passports was linked to charges being drawn up there, and so would have concluded any assiduous reader of the newspapers.</p> <p>The Hindujas were becoming notorious, as ministers in Britain feted them and they feted ministers. In November 1999, they invited the Blairs to a glittering Diwali party in London - in the conspicuous absence of senior diplomats from the Indian high commission.</p> <p>None the less, when Mandelson last year personally approached Straw about yet a third Hinduja brother, Prakash, who wanted British citizenship, an official in the home secretary's private office emailed Walmsley saying the family business could benefit \"UK interests\" and Straw would like the case to be dealt with \"helpfully\".</p> <p>Hammond asked the home secretary what he mean by \"helpfully\". It meant he wanted it dealt with \"properly, as was his approach to all cases\", Hammond records Straw's reply. \"If it was right, within the rules, to exercise discretion in this case, then the Home Office should look to do so.\"</p> <p>These knaves clearly think we're fools.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:&quot;richard.norton-taylor@theguardian.com&quot;\">richard.norton-taylor@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Hammond report</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.official-documents.co.uk/document/hc287/hc287/287.htm\">The Hammond Inquiry: full text</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,449064,00.html\">Summary of the main points</a></p> <p><b>Related special report</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/\">New Labour in power</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,449014,00.html\">09.09.2001: Mandelson cleared over passports row</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,449038,00.html\">09.03.2001: Vaz cleared over Hinduja affair</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,449071,00.html\">09.03.2001: Questions left unanswered by Hammond Inquiry</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,449016,00.html\">09.03.2001: Mandelson's response to Hammond Inquiry</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,448982,00.html\">09.03.2001: Report gives Mandelson no way back</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430254,00.html\">29.01.2001, analysis: How Mandelson and Campbell came to blows</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430250,00.html\">29.01.2001, analysis: 'I think Peter has been slightly detached'</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430189,00.html\">29.01.2001, leader: Spinning out of control</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430167,00.html\">29.01.2001, Roy Hattersley: Why the passing of Peter isn't very important</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,429979,00.html\">28.01.2001, Andrew Rawnsley: Why he really had to go</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427850,00.html\">25.01.2001: A glittering career in ruins</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,427840,00.html\">25.01.2001, Benjamin Wegg-Prosser: I'm Mandy, fire me</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0309mandelson.ra\">09.03.2001: Mandelson's response to Hammond Inquiry report (2mins 36)</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0124mandelson.ra\">24.01.2001: Peter Mandelson's resignation statement</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gall/0,8542,427511,00.html\">Peter Mandelson: a life in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Cartoon</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/graphic/0,7367,428461,00.html\">Steve Bell on life without Peter Mandelson</a></p> <p><b>The 1998 home loan row</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427485,00.html\">Text of resignation letter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427469,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson, the minister and the \u00a3373,000 loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427471,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson: undone by a story that could not be done</a></p> <p><b>Andrew Rawnsley: inside New Labour</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369240,00.html\">Mandelson resigns over his home loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369238,00.html\">Rivals in the Labour party</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,366690,00.html\">How Mandy replaced Mo</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7ffde\">Have your say on the Mandelson affair</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.sunday-times.co.uk/news/pages/sti/2001/01/28/stifocnws02001.html\" target=\"_new\">Peter Mandelson: Why I had to go - Sunday Times, 28.01.2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427516,00.html\">24.01.2001: Full text of Mandelson's resignation statement</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hindujagroup.com/history.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hinduja group history</a><br><a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/default.asp?PageId=3284\" target=\"_new\">Downing Street press briefing</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Hartlepool Mail</a></p>",

Asked by Andrew Marr, the BBC's political editor in January whether he was aware of the Bofors case when he was inquiring about the Hindujas' British citizenship, Mandelson replied: \"I didn't have any knowledge of that, no. All I know is that they volunteered to assist in the underwriting of the costs of that zone in the dome.\" But Hammond himself now admits these intelligence reports were seen by Mandelson in October or November 1998, and that he went ahead regardless with the acceptance of \u00a31m of Hinduja sponsorship money. Mandelson recklessly decided to discount the danger of adverse publicity if the truth came out. Behind the scenes another department, the Foreign Office, was, like MI6, under no illusions. In 1996, Caroline Elmes of the FO's south Asian department, told Andrew Walmsley, director of the Home Office's nationality division, about the Indian government's criminal investigation into the Bofors arms deal - a scandal which had featured prominently in media there for more than a decade. \"Given the activism of the Indian courts,\" she warned, \"it is conceivable that the case could come alight.\" She gave a warning in language remarkably strong for the FO that \"at the very least the Hinduja brothers can be said to have sailed close to the wind in building their business empire\". Ministers, as the Scott report into the \"arms-to-Iraq\" affair so amply demonstrated, seem to have little time for intelligence reports. In its latest annual report, the parliamentary intelligence and security committee noted that the cabinet committee on the intelligence services had not met since 1995. Yet of course ministers did not in fact need any secret intelligence to know what the Hindujas were up to. Indian investigators became increasingly convinced that the brothers' request for British passports was linked to charges being drawn up there, and so would have concluded any assiduous reader of the newspapers. The Hindujas were becoming notorious, as ministers in Britain feted them and they feted ministers. In November 1999, they invited the Blairs to a glittering Diwali party in London - in the conspicuous absence of senior diplomats from the Indian high commission. None the less, when Mandelson last year personally approached Straw about yet a third Hinduja brother, Prakash, who wanted British citizenship, an official in the home secretary's private office emailed Walmsley saying the family business could benefit \"UK interests\" and Straw would like the case to be dealt with \"helpfully\". Hammond asked the home secretary what he mean by \"helpfully\". It meant he wanted it dealt with \"properly, as was his approach to all cases\", Hammond records Straw's reply. \"If it was right, within the rules, to exercise discretion in this case, then the Home Office should look to do so.\" These knaves clearly think we're fools. richard.norton-taylor@theguardian.com Hammond report The Hammond Inquiry: full text Summary of the main points Related special report New Labour in power Related articles 09.09.2001: Mandelson cleared over passports row 09.03.2001: Vaz cleared over Hinduja affair 09.03.2001: Questions left unanswered by Hammond Inquiry 09.03.2001: Mandelson's response to Hammond Inquiry 09.03.2001: Report gives Mandelson no way back 29.01.2001, analysis: How Mandelson and Campbell came to blows 29.01.2001, analysis: 'I think Peter has been slightly detached' 29.01.2001, leader: Spinning out of control 29.01.2001, Roy Hattersley: Why the passing of Peter isn't very important 28.01.2001, Andrew Rawnsley: Why he really had to go 25.01.2001: A glittering career in ruins 25.01.2001, Benjamin Wegg-Prosser: I'm Mandy, fire me Audio 09.03.2001: Mandelson's response to Hammond Inquiry report (2mins 36) 24.01.2001: Peter Mandelson's resignation statement Photo gallery Peter Mandelson: a life in pictures Cartoon Steve Bell on life without Peter Mandelson The 1998 home loan row Text of resignation letter 24.12.1998: Mandelson, the minister and the \u00a3373,000 loan 24.12.1998: Mandelson: undone by a story that could not be done Andrew Rawnsley: inside New Labour Mandelson resigns over his home loan Rivals in the Labour party How Mandy replaced Mo Talk about it Have your say on the Mandelson affair Useful links Peter Mandelson: Why I had to go - Sunday Times, 28.01.2001 24.01.2001: Full text of Mandelson's resignation statement Hinduja group history Downing Street press briefing Hartlepool Mail",

The Mail gave a page to Roger Scruton, the right-wing polemicist, to celebrate Britishness. \"The asylum racket,\" he wrote, \"has alerted the British people to the fact that their government will neither defend them from invasion, nor ask for proof of loyalty to the crown of England from those who settle here.\" But the overwhelming press sentiment of the week was of unease about the language used by Mr Hague. As the Times, which tends to steer a middle way on the euro, put it: \"Mr Hague has knowingly raised the political stakes. In so doing he has voluntarily engaged in his own European integration. Much of the continental right is flirting with blood and soil in a strident opposition to outsiders ... Mr Hague said on Sunday that 'British people are not narrow nationalists. They are not xenophobes'. That is precisely why they will not stampede to politicians who seem to be playing the race card from the bottom of the deck.\" By intentionally or otherwise identifying the Euro-sceptic position with views many potential Eurosceptics find unpalatable, Mr Hague has helped the euro supporters, as a reading of this week's press makes clear. It will turn out to have been a significant week for the euro. \u0095 Peter Cole is professor of journalism at Sheffield University Related special reports Special report: election countdown Special report: refugees in Britain",

      "body": "<b>Edited extracts from the Hammond report</b> <br> <p>The reputations of individuals depend, to some extent, on the conclusions which I have been called upon to reach, although not to the extent of involving questions of criminal conduct, as did the Profumo affair. </p> <p>I have ... had regard to the fact that, in the case of events which occurred in 1998, ie more than two and a half years ago, recollections are hazy and it would not be surprising if accounts of different individuals are not wholly consistent with each other. </p> <p>I have not interviewed any of the Hinduja brothers. Their position is well known from their public statements. </p> <p>There are four brothers named Hinduja; these include Gopichand (known as GP), Srichand (SP) and Prakash (PP). They are international businessmen with extensive interests in India and in other countries including the United Kingdom. </p> <p>My main conclusions are as follows: </p> <p>The applications for naturalisation of GP Hinduja and SP Hinduja were handled properly. No improper pressure was brought to bear by any minister. </p> <p>The inquiries made on behalf of Prakash Hinduja were handled properly by all concerned. </p> <p>Keith Vaz made representations on behalf of both SP and GP, but these were in the context of many other immigration and nationality cases in which he made representations. </p> <p>Mr Mandelson or his officials made or passed on inquiries on behalf of SP and Prakash. It is likely that Mr Mandelson spoke directly to [Mike] O'Brien [in relation to SP]. Mr Mandelson's belief that he had not had a telephone conversation with Mr O'Brien was honestly held. </p> <p>Mr Mandelson did not make representations on behalf of either SP or Prakash. </p> <p>There is no evidence of any improper relationship between him and the Hindujas or of any connection between his contacts between them over the sponsorship of the Millennium Dome and their efforts to obtain naturalisation. </p> <p>There was intelligence material about the Hinduja brothers, but this was not drawn to the attention of the Home Office and it probably would not have affected the outcome of the naturalisation applications if it had been. </p> <p>In some respects, the processing of the naturalisation applications by the Home Office could have been improved, but systems are now in place which address these issues. </p> <p>Record keeping in the private offices involved ... was, in some respects, unsatisfactory, and there is a need to address this issue and that of the monitoring of telephone calls. </p> <p><b> GP Hinduja</b><br> </p> <p>An initial application [for naturalisation as a British citizen] was received from GP Hinduja on February 21 1990. This was apparently sent to the then home secretary, Kenneth Baker, and forwarded to the nationality department. </p> <p>He had entered the UK in 1982 and had obtained indefinite leave to remain here on July 18 1985. </p> <p>The normal checks were made with the police and security service, which were negative. In view of the fact that investigations were being carried out in India into alleged corruption relating to the award of an army contract to the Swedish firm Bofors, inquiries were made of the Foreign Office (FCO) and the security service was contacted again. The security service response was again negative. </p> <p>The FCO suggested that his application should be treated in the same way as any other application; as long as he remained under suspicion and investigation in India, it would cause considerable difficulty with the Indian government if his application was given special treatment. </p> <p>In 1991 a submission was put forward ... recommending refusal of his application on the grounds, first, that he appeared not to meet the unwaivable requirements of being \"in\" the UK on the date on which the five-year application period began; and secondly, on the basis that, because of the Bofors allegations it would be difficult to satisfy the requirement of being of \"good character\". </p> <p>There was also some doubt about whether he had genuinely \"thrown in his lot\" with the UK. </p> <p>Mr Hinduja was told only that his application was refused on the grounds of his failure to comply with the residence requirements. </p> <p>Between 1993 and 1996 inquiries ... were made on behalf of the Hindujas by a number of people including Edward Heath, Sir Jay Gohel, Keith Vaz, Dame Angela Rumbold [MP] and Lord Feldman. </p> <p>On March 3 1997 a second application was received from GP. It seems that Andrew Walmsley [director of the Home Office nationality division] decided that in view of the high profile of the Hinduja brothers and of the political sensitivities, it would be better to wait until after the election before going to ministers about making a decision. </p> <p>On July 3 1997, Mr Walmsley put forward a submission to Mr O'Brien recommending that the application be granted. If Mr Walmsley had checked again with the FCO before submitting this minute he would have discovered that there had been a major and (in India) well-publicised development in the Bofors investigation in January 1997 when the Indian authorities had received important information from the Swiss authorities which they had been seeking since 1990. </p> <p>Naturalisation was granted to Mr Hinduja in November 1997. The application was, in my view, handled properly by officials and ministers. </p> <p><b> SP Hinduja</b><br> </p> <p>SP Hinduja, the eldest brother, first applied for naturalisation on February 21 1990. In April 1991, SP was informed that his application had been refused. The letter only mentioned SP's excess absences and made no mention of any doubts about Mr Hinduja meeting the \"good character\" requirement. I am satisfied the case was dealt with properly. </p> <p>Because of the events which led to the resignation of Mr Mandelson, much attention has been focused on the issue of whether a personal telephone conversation took place between Mr Mandelson and Mr O'Brien in June or July 1998. In view of this, I have decided that I must deal with this issue in some detail, although I have concluded that in itself the issue is relatively insignificant. </p> <p>When I interviewed Mr O'Brien he told me he was certain he had had a personal telephone conversation with Mr Mandelson about a naturalisation matter concerning SP at the end of June or beginning of July. Mr Mandelson said firmly that he did not remember the call. </p> <p>Mr O'Brien said that his assistant private secretary in 1998, Matthew Laxton, had sent an email about SP's interest in naturalisation to Mr Walmsley on July 2 1998. This email had clearly been written as a result of some form of contact from Mr Mandelson or his office. </p> <p>Mr O'Brien told me that Mr Mandelson had explained that Mr Hinduja was a prominent man in the Asian business community who had applied for citizenship and been refused. Mr Mandelson had told Mr O'Brien that Mr Hinduja would not want to make a further application if there was little chance of success. </p> <p>Mr O'Brien was clear that Mr Mandelson had not made any representations on behalf of SP but had tried to establish the government's policy in this area so he could relay the details back to SP. Mr Mandelson had specifically said that he was not asking Mr O'Brien to grant naturalisation. </p> <p>Although Mr O'Brien had known Mr Mandelson for some time, he did not often get telephone calls from him. This was one of the reasons why he remembered the call. </p> <p>Mr Mandelson told me that he did not remember how the issue had been raised with him by either SP or GP. He did not remember any correspondence on this subject at that time and said he thought that the issue might have been raised informally at a meeting he had had with the Hindujas about some other matters. </p> <p>Mr Mandelson categorically denies that there was ever any link made by the Hindujas between the funding of the dome and the question of naturalisation. </p> <p>According to Mr Mandelson, one or both of the Hindujas had asked about a relaxation of government policy in relation to citizenship and whether it would have any bearing on SP's wish to become a UK citizen. Mr Mandelson told the Hindujas that he did not know the answer but would find out. </p> <p>The alleged telephone call resurfaced in 2000-2001 as the result of a written parliamentary question by Norman Baker MP which was due for answer on December 18 2000. [It asked what representations had been made on behalf of GP and SP's citizenship applications by Mr Mandelson and Mr Vaz] </p> <p>Mr Mandelson told me that he had been keen to deal with the question and get it answered as soon as possible. The reason why Mr Mandelson queried why it was necessary to mention him at all in the answer was first, because the Norman Baker question had asked about representations and Mr Mandelson had not made any representations. He had not expressed support or endorsement. Second, at this stage of his limited involvement in this matter, no application had been made by SP Hinduja. </p> <p>Mr Straw's recollection is that Mr Mandelson approached him in the lobby and initiated a conversation about the Norman Baker question. Mr Straw explained that he remembered this discussion because Mr Mandelson had said, more than once, that he did not see why he should be mentioned in the answer. Mr Straw told Mr Mandelson that Mr O'Brien had a clear recollection of having had a conversation with Mr Mandelson about SP Hinduja in 1998. Mr Straw recalled that Mr Mandelson's reaction was along the lines of \"Did I?\" </p> <p>There is a difference of view between the Home Office and Northern Ireland Office about whether, in December 2000 or January 2001, Mr Mandelson had acknowledged a telephone call with Mr O'Brien and told his private office that this had been \"private\". If such a claim were true it would, of course, seriously undermine Mr Mandelson's contention that his dealings with Mr O'Brien's office were done entirely through his private office. </p> <p>Mr Straw's assistant private secretary Jane Fowler said that during the course of a discussion with Mr Mandelson's private secretary Sarah Todd, Ms Todd said she had spoken to Mr Mandelson and he had acknowledged that his conversation with Mr O'Brien had been \"private\" and so he did not want this conversation mentioned in the reply to the parliamentary question. </p> <p>Ms Todd told me that she did not remember using the words private or confidential. </p> <p>Mr Mandelson told me that as, at that point, he had not acknowledged that a telephone conversation with Mr O'Brien had actually taken place, he was not likely to suggest that such a call would have been private. I am unable to come to a clear view as to whether the words \"private or confidential\" were ever used in this context. </p> <p>The question from Norman Baker was answered on Thursday January 18 2001. The following Sunday, the Observer carried a story with the headline \"Mandelson helped dome backer's passport bid\". The Observer reported Mr Mandelson's statement: \"To the limited extent I was involved in this matter I was always sensitive to the proprieties. The matter was dealt with by my private secretary. At no time did I support or endorse this application for citizenship.\" </p> <p>This statement was to play a significant part in the rest of the week's events, particularly when later in the week, when Mr Mandelson thought that there was some documentary evidence to support the existence of the telephone call, he had acquiesced in the view that a call had taken place. </p> <p>Despite the paucity of written records, the hazy and inconclusive recollections of many of those involved and the inconsistencies in the various accounts, although I cannot reach a view with any certainty, the best conclusion which I feel able to reach is that a personal telephone conversation involving Mr O'Brien and Mr Mandelson took place. </p> <p>I have also concluded that there were a number of contacts between the then ministers' private offices and that it is likely that Mr Mandelson spoke personally to [Matthew] Laxton [O'Brien's then assistant private secretary]. </p> <p>All this was clearly a muddle. Events moved very quickly and definitive statements about what had happened in 1998 were made on the basis of evidence which turned out to be incomplete. </p> <p><b>Hammond report</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.official-documents.co.uk/document/hc287/hc287/287.htm\">The Hammond Inquiry: full text</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,449064,00.html\">Summary of the main points</a></p> <p><b>Related special report</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/\">New Labour in power</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,449014,00.html\">09.09.2001: Mandelson cleared over passports row</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,449038,00.html\">09.03.2001: Vaz cleared over Hinduja affair</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,449071,00.html\">09.03.2001: Questions left unanswered by Hammond Inquiry</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,449016,00.html\">09.03.2001: Mandelson's response to Hammond Inquiry</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,448982,00.html\">09.03.2001: Report gives Mandelson no way back</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430254,00.html\">29.01.2001, analysis: How Mandelson and Campbell came to blows</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430250,00.html\">29.01.2001, analysis: 'I think Peter has been slightly detached'</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430189,00.html\">29.01.2001, leader: Spinning out of control</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430167,00.html\">29.01.2001, Roy Hattersley: Why the passing of Peter isn't very important</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,429979,00.html\">28.01.2001, Andrew Rawnsley: Why he really had to go</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427850,00.html\">25.01.2001: A glittering career in ruins</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,427840,00.html\">25.01.2001, Benjamin Wegg-Prosser: I'm Mandy, fire me</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0309mandelson.ra\">09.03.2001: Mandelson's response to Hammond Inquiry report (2mins 36)</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0124mandelson.ra\">24.01.2001: Peter Mandelson's resignation statement</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gall/0,8542,427511,00.html\">Peter Mandelson: a life in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Cartoon</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/graphic/0,7367,428461,00.html\">Steve Bell on life without Peter Mandelson</a></p> <p><b>The 1998 home loan row</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427485,00.html\">Text of resignation letter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427469,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson, the minister and the \u00a3373,000 loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427471,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson: undone by a story that could not be done</a></p> <p><b>Andrew Rawnsley: inside New Labour</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369240,00.html\">Mandelson resigns over his home loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369238,00.html\">Rivals in the Labour party</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,366690,00.html\">How Mandy replaced Mo</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7ffde\">Have your say on the Mandelson affair</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.sunday-times.co.uk/news/pages/sti/2001/01/28/stifocnws02001.html\" target=\"_new\">Peter Mandelson: Why I had to go - Sunday Times, 28.01.2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427516,00.html\">24.01.2001: Full text of Mandelson's resignation statement</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hindujagroup.com/history.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hinduja group history</a><br><a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/default.asp?PageId=3284\" target=\"_new\">Downing Street press briefing</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Hartlepool Mail</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Edited extracts from the Hammond report The reputations of individuals depend, to some extent, on the conclusions which I have been called upon to reach, although not to the extent of involving questions of criminal conduct, as did the Profumo affair. I have ... had regard to the fact that, in the case of events which occurred in 1998, ie more than two and a half years ago, recollections are hazy and it would not be surprising if accounts of different individuals are not wholly consistent with each other. I have not interviewed any of the Hinduja brothers. Their position is well known from their public statements. There are four brothers named Hinduja; these include Gopichand (known as GP), Srichand (SP) and Prakash (PP). They are international businessmen with extensive interests in India and in other countries including the United Kingdom. My main conclusions are as follows: The applications for naturalisation of GP Hinduja and SP Hinduja were handled properly. No improper pressure was brought to bear by any minister. The inquiries made on behalf of Prakash Hinduja were handled properly by all concerned. Keith Vaz made representations on behalf of both SP and GP, but these were in the context of many other immigration and nationality cases in which he made representations. Mr Mandelson or his officials made or passed on inquiries on behalf of SP and Prakash. It is likely that Mr Mandelson spoke directly to [Mike] O'Brien [in relation to SP]. Mr Mandelson's belief that he had not had a telephone conversation with Mr O'Brien was honestly held. Mr Mandelson did not make representations on behalf of either SP or Prakash. There is no evidence of any improper relationship between him and the Hindujas or of any connection between his contacts between them over the sponsorship of the Millennium Dome and their efforts to obtain naturalisation. There was intelligence material about the Hinduja brothers, but this was not drawn to the attention of the Home Office and it probably would not have affected the outcome of the naturalisation applications if it had been. In some respects, the processing of the naturalisation applications by the Home Office could have been improved, but systems are now in place which address these issues. Record keeping in the private offices involved ... was, in some respects, unsatisfactory, and there is a need to address this issue and that of the monitoring of telephone calls. GP Hinduja An initial application [for naturalisation as a British citizen] was received from GP Hinduja on February 21 1990. This was apparently sent to the then home secretary, Kenneth Baker, and forwarded to the nationality department. He had entered the UK in 1982 and had obtained indefinite leave to remain here on July 18 1985. The normal checks were made with the police and security service, which were negative. In view of the fact that investigations were being carried out in India into alleged corruption relating to the award of an army contract to the Swedish firm Bofors, inquiries were made of the Foreign Office (FCO) and the security service was contacted again. The security service response was again negative. The FCO suggested that his application should be treated in the same way as any other application; as long as he remained under suspicion and investigation in India, it would cause considerable difficulty with the Indian government if his application was given special treatment. In 1991 a submission was put forward ... recommending refusal of his application on the grounds, first, that he appeared not to meet the unwaivable requirements of being \"in\" the UK on the date on which the five-year application period began; and secondly, on the basis that, because of the Bofors allegations it would be difficult to satisfy the requirement of being of \"good character\". There was also some doubt about whether he had genuinely \"thrown in his lot\" with the UK. Mr Hinduja was told only that his application was refused on the grounds of his failure to comply with the residence requirements. Between 1993 and 1996 inquiries ... were made on behalf of the Hindujas by a number of people including Edward Heath, Sir Jay Gohel, Keith Vaz, Dame Angela Rumbold [MP] and Lord Feldman. On March 3 1997 a second application was received from GP. It seems that Andrew Walmsley [director of the Home Office nationality division] decided that in view of the high profile of the Hinduja brothers and of the political sensitivities, it would be better to wait until after the election before going to ministers about making a decision. On July 3 1997, Mr Walmsley put forward a submission to Mr O'Brien recommending that the application be granted. If Mr Walmsley had checked again with the FCO before submitting this minute he would have discovered that there had been a major and (in India) well-publicised development in the Bofors investigation in January 1997 when the Indian authorities had received important information from the Swiss authorities which they had been seeking since 1990. Naturalisation was granted to Mr Hinduja in November 1997. The application was, in my view, handled properly by officials and ministers. SP Hinduja SP Hinduja, the eldest brother, first applied for naturalisation on February 21 1990. In April 1991, SP was informed that his application had been refused. The letter only mentioned SP's excess absences and made no mention of any doubts about Mr Hinduja meeting the \"good character\" requirement. I am satisfied the case was dealt with properly. Because of the events which led to the resignation of Mr Mandelson, much attention has been focused on the issue of whether a personal telephone conversation took place between Mr Mandelson and Mr O'Brien in June or July 1998. In view of this, I have decided that I must deal with this issue in some detail, although I have concluded that in itself the issue is relatively insignificant.

Mr Mandelson told the Hindujas that he did not know the answer but would find out. The alleged telephone call resurfaced in 2000-2001 as the result of a written parliamentary question by Norman Baker MP which was due for answer on December 18 2000.

Mr Straw's assistant private secretary Jane Fowler said that during the course of a discussion with Mr Mandelson's private secretary Sarah Todd, Ms Todd said she had spoken to Mr Mandelson and he had acknowledged that his conversation with Mr O'Brien had been \"private\" and so he did not want this conversation mentioned in the reply to the parliamentary question. Ms Todd told me that she did not remember using the words private or confidential. Mr Mandelson told me that as, at that point, he had not acknowledged that a telephone conversation with Mr O'Brien had actually taken place, he was not likely to suggest that such a call would have been private. I am unable to come to a clear view as to whether the words \"private or confidential\" were ever used in this context. The question from Norman Baker was answered on Thursday January 18 2001. The following Sunday, the Observer carried a story with the headline \"Mandelson helped dome backer's passport bid\". The Observer reported Mr Mandelson's statement: \"To the limited extent I was involved in this matter I was always sensitive to the proprieties. The matter was dealt with by my private secretary. At no time did I support or endorse this application for citizenship.\" This statement was to play a significant part in the rest of the week's events, particularly when later in the week, when Mr Mandelson thought that there was some documentary evidence to support the existence of the telephone call, he had acquiesced in the view that a call had taken place. Despite the paucity of written records, the hazy and inconclusive recollections of many of those involved and the inconsistencies in the various accounts, although I cannot reach a view with any certainty, the best conclusion which I feel able to reach is that a personal telephone conversation involving Mr O'Brien and Mr Mandelson took place. I have also concluded that there were a number of contacts between the then ministers' private offices and that it is likely that Mr Mandelson spoke personally to [Matthew] Laxton [O'Brien's then assistant private secretary]. All this was clearly a muddle. Events moved very quickly and definitive statements about what had happened in 1998 were made on the basis of evidence which turned out to be incomplete.

From the splendour of an official residence across the Irish Sea and all the trappings of high office, Peter Mandelson yesterday struck out on a more lowly political course, maintaining that his future now lay with the parochial and not the national. A few people believed him.</p> <p>So, in the fading Victorian grandeur of Hutton Road and his other home in the better end of an old steel and shipbuilding town, the former Northern Ireland secretary insisted: \"It will be Hartlepool first from now on. I'm not going to lose my voice in politics but I am going on being a first-class constituency MP.\"</p> <p>His visit to a struggling north-east constituency, which at times has taken a back seat to wider ambitions, was given a \"Peter returns to the grassroots\" billing. Schoolchildren bursting past special branch minders thrust autograph books in his face, pensioners clasped his hand, some cheered and some jeered.</p> <p>Mr Mandelson cruised effortlessly through school and hospital visits and private constituency business, after a shaky start.</p> <p>Outside his home he read out his 300-odd word statement grimly and ended by saying: \"I intend to concentrate on winning back the full trust of my Hartlepool constituents and serving in Parliament for another term. For reasons I hope people will understand, I do not desire a return to government. There are more ways to serve New Labour and fulfil our ambitions for the country. This I intend to do.\" He refused to elaborate.</p> <p>Trust?

      "bodyText": "Hillsborough one week; Hutton Road the next. From the splendour of an official residence across the Irish Sea and all the trappings of high office, Peter Mandelson yesterday struck out on a more lowly political course, maintaining that his future now lay with the parochial and not the national. A few people believed him. So, in the fading Victorian grandeur of Hutton Road and his other home in the better end of an old steel and shipbuilding town, the former Northern Ireland secretary insisted: \"It will be Hartlepool first from now on. I'm not going to lose my voice in politics but I am going on being a first-class constituency MP.\" His visit to a struggling north-east constituency, which at times has taken a back seat to wider ambitions, was given a \"Peter returns to the grassroots\" billing. Schoolchildren bursting past special branch minders thrust autograph books in his face, pensioners clasped his hand, some cheered and some jeered. Mr Mandelson cruised effortlessly through school and hospital visits and private constituency business, after a shaky start. Outside his home he read out his 300-odd word statement grimly and ended by saying: \"I intend to concentrate on winning back the full trust of my Hartlepool constituents and serving in Parliament for another term. For reasons I hope people will understand, I do not desire a return to government. There are more ways to serve New Labour and fulfil our ambitions for the country. This I intend to do.\" He refused to elaborate. Trust? It was the first admission that he had a fight on his hands to retain a once solid Labour seat (majority 17,000) now regarded by Labour's hierarchy as more marginal since the party lost control of the local council last May, and the intervention of a populist local Tory, Gus Robinson the builder, with the added irritation of Arthur Scargill, the miner's union president, standing for the small Socialist Labour Party he created. Throughout the day, Peter Mandelson's tactic was clear: emphasise the local, avoid most of the national media and be kind to the excellent local paper the Hartlepool Mail. On Thursday night he phoned its deputy editor, to say he would speak to them exclusively. \"I feel slightly drained but happy that the whole thing is behind me,\" he told the paper. \"It has been, I would say, a searing experience. I feel bruised, but I would like to thank the people who have supported me. This town has been strong ... my job now is to restore people's confidence in me.\" Hammond report The Hammond Inquiry: full text Summary of the main points Related special report New Labour in power Related articles 09.09.2001: Mandelson cleared over passports row 09.03.2001: Vaz cleared over Hinduja affair 09.03.2001: Questions left unanswered by Hammond Inquiry 09.03.2001: Mandelson's response to Hammond Inquiry 09.03.2001: Report gives Mandelson no way back 29.01.2001, analysis: How Mandelson and Campbell came to blows 29.01.2001, analysis: 'I think Peter has been slightly detached' 29.01.2001, leader: Spinning out of control 29.01.2001, Roy Hattersley: Why the passing of Peter isn't very important 28.01.2001, Andrew Rawnsley: Why he really had to go 25.01.2001: A glittering career in ruins 25.01.2001, Benjamin Wegg-Prosser: I'm Mandy, fire me Audio 09.03.2001: Mandelson's response to Hammond Inquiry report (2mins 36) 24.01.2001: Peter Mandelson's resignation statement Photo gallery Peter Mandelson: a life in pictures Cartoon Steve Bell on life without Peter Mandelson The 1998 home loan row Text of resignation letter 24.12.1998: Mandelson, the minister and the \u00a3373,000 loan 24.12.1998: Mandelson: undone by a story that could not be done Andrew Rawnsley: inside New Labour Mandelson resigns over his home loan Rivals in the Labour party How Mandy replaced Mo Talk about it Have your say on the Mandelson affair Useful links Peter Mandelson: Why I had to go - Sunday Times, 28.01.2001 24.01.2001: Full text of Mandelson's resignation statement Hinduja group history Downing Street press briefing Hartlepool Mail",

But Mrs Justice Bracewell also found that Mrs Evans was lawfully suspended after further allegations of pupil mistreatment were made against her and should not return to St Mary's junior school in Caldicot, south Wales, until after the three day hearing next week. The outcome of the hearing, before the school governors, will determine if and when the 56-year-old teacher can return to work. At the high court in Cardiff, the National Union of Teachers, on behalf of Mrs Evans, had accused education officials of having a \"pig-headed attitude\" over her return to work. It said Monmouthshire council and the school governors had ignored proper disciplinary procedures. In her ruling yesterday, Mrs Justice Bracewell said: \"Mrs Evans faces very serious allegations but she has been presented with three versions (of disciplinary proceedings) inconsistent with one another and none applicable with disciplining a head teacher.\" Mrs Evans has been suspended on full pay for 18 months after being accused of slapping a special needs pupil. She was convicted of assault in July, but cleared on appeal in September. The suspension remained in place because police were investigating further claims of mistreatment. But in October the crown prosecution service said it would be taking no further action.",

      "body": "<p>Sixty-six years ago, skier Count Felix Schaffgotsch of Austria wandered among the mountains of Idaho and pinpointed the peaks above the unknown sheep-farming town of Ketchum as being the perfect location for the first ski resort in the US. One year later, in December 1936, Sun Valley Ski Resort had been christened by the marketing men and was built and open for business with a chairlift - based on a hoist used for hauling bananas into ship's holds - ready to take punters up Dollar Mountain. </p> <p>The resort was the brainchild of Averell Harriman, president of Union Pacific Railroad, who had employed Schaffgotsch to search out the ideal spot for a ski resort in the northwest, which would attract more passengers on to his trains. However, because of the remote and unknown location of Sun Valley, Harriman needed to get his expensive new baby into the public spotlight, and it was Hollywood that supplied the extra push. </p> <p>By inviting stars such as Clark Gable and Errol Flynn to the resort's opening party, Harriman ensured that Sun Valley hit the headlines before the first skis had even schussed across the snow, and the stars have continued to patronise Sun Valley's elegant ski lodges and slopes ever since. </p> <p>Indeed, Hollywood has come en masse to Sun Valley on several occasions. Among the numerous movies filmed here or in the nearby Sawtooth Mountains were How to Marry a Millionaire and Bus Stop, starring Marilyn Monroe in the 50s, and Clint Eastwood's Pale Rider in 1985. It also did the place no harm that Ernest Hemingway wrote much of For Whom the Bell Tolls while staying at Sun Valley Resort Hotel, and even his suicide in Ketchum in 1961 brought more publicity to the area. </p> <p>Today, Clint Eastwood, Bruce Willis, Demi Moore, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Tom Hanks and Jamie Lee Curtis are just a few of the screen icons who own property in Sun Valley. Which, among other things, means that it is also one of the most expensive ski resorts in the US. A common complaint is the cost of lift passes (around \u00a337 a day), but when conditions are right, you may get some of the best skiing on the continent and, whatever the conditions on the mountain, you can enjoy the luxury mountain lodges. </p> <p>It can be a little disconcerting to walk into River Run or Warm Springs lodges at the base of the ski runs, or Seattle Ridge Lodge high up on the mountain, and find yourself clomping across deep pile carpets in snow-encrusted ski boots, dumping soggy hats and gloves on elegant heavy wooden dining tables, or applying sun cream inside marble-clad \"rest rooms\" that could grace any five-star hotel. But that's how you attract millionaires, which is a large part of what Sun Valley is about. </p> <p>Another major plus of the resort is that even in a winter like this one, when snow levels have been around 50% down, Sun Valley has the biggest man-made snow-making system in the world, covering 645 acres. </p> <p>Most of the ski action takes place on 9,150ft Bald Mountain, directly above Ketchum. The first lift didn't open here until 1939; today there are 14, with runs catering to all abilities. However, it's worth noting that the mountain's constant steep pitch can result in a lot of runs being \"under-graded\" - this is the first place I've skied where some of the green runs have moguls, and many blues would be graded black(ish) at most other resorts (bear in mind that there are no reds in the US). </p> <p>\"Baldy\" stands out as a huge bulge of rock above the surrounding landscape, and you can follow the sun around its three faces throughout the day. You also get magnificent views of the wild, remote mountain ranges of central Idaho to the north and the wide Snake River Plain to the south. </p> <p>Sun Valley's original ski hill, Dollar Mountain, is tiny in comparison - only 6,638ft high, it's located a couple of miles east of Ketchum, looking down on the Grand Dame of 1936, Sun Valley Resort Hotel. It shows how much things have changed that the mountain which once attracted Hollywood greats is now regarded almost exclusively as a beginner's area. </p> <p>In addition to some of the best downhill skiing in the US, that isn't all the place is about. There are more than 200km of cross-country ski trails along the Wood River Valley, which runs beneath Bald Mountain, snowshoe trails on both Bald and Dollar mountains, ice skating on indoor and outdoor rinks at Sun Valley Resort, and if money is no object, Sun Valley Heli Ski can get you out into perfect powder country. And when you finally want to take the strain off your legs, you can hand it over to sled dogs who will haul you into the surrounding hills for anything from one hour to overnight trips. </p> <p>Then again, if you've invested in a multi-day ski pass, you'll probably want to get value for money and ski as much as possible. And since this is Sun Valley, you may even end up sharing a lift with one of your favourite movie stars. </p> <p><strong> Getting there </strong></p> <p> Ski The American Dream (0208 5521201) offers one-week room-only packages at the Sun Valley Resort Hotel for \u00a3895, based on two adults sharing and including flights via Salt Lake City and transfers. </p> <p><strong> Accommodation</strong></p> <p> There is no real budget accommodation available in the Sun Valley area.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Born on March 8 1904 at Sandown on the Isle of Wight, Charles Boxer was the son of a British officer who was wounded while serving with Kitchener at Atbara and died while leading his men over the top in France in 1915. Charles Boxer was educated at Wellington and Sandhurst. The navy rejected him because of deficient eyesight and he joined the army in 1923. He enrolled in the Lincolns, following in the footsteps of his late father and his elder brother, Myles. In 1930 Boxer was assigned to Japan as a language officer, that is, a language student and military observer. During the next three years he studied language intensively and shared the stoic existence of Japanese military units with whom he lived. He also became proficient in kendo, the Japanese form of fencing. He travelled widely in the orient and bought many books, a practice he continued into his late 80s. After a two-year stint in Britain, mostly in the intelligence section of the war office, Boxer was posted to Hong Kong, where he arrived in 1937 and remained until 1945.</p> <p>Between 1937 and 1941, Boxer, promoted from captain to major, became one of the key members of the Far East Combined Bureau, a British intelligence organisation that extended from Shanghai to Singapore. By 1940, most of its Hong Kong office had been transferred to Singapore, leaving Boxer as the army's chief intelligence officer in the colony. His performance was later evaluated by Major-General GE Grimsdale. From 1939 until 1945 Grimsdale headed British army intelligence successively in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Chungking. He played a key role in the creation of the FECB and remained one of its staunch supporters. The two travelled together on trips to war-torn China. Grimsdale declared Boxer to be \"a very capable intelligence staff officer, with a quick and accurate mind and a fluent pen. I could not have wanted a better or more congenial assistant\". </p> <p>Boxer was, like most other prominent figures in the colony, socially very active. But he was often away. After the Japanese army occupied Canton and territory adjacent to the Kowloon mainland, Boxer frequently visited the new commandants in order to ascertain Japanese intentions. He also made several extended trips to remote parts of China. In Chungking he negotiated directly with Chiang Kai-shek to establish a Sino-British secret radio corps to monitor Japanese overflights. He regularly ferried to Macao, where he combined business (sharing intelligence with the Portuguese governor) with pleasure (archival research and conviviality). He returned to Japan on several occasions. His last pre-war visit came in mid-1939, on honeymoon following his marriage to Ursula Norah Anstice Tulloch. </p> <p>Later he became deeply worried about the state of Anglo-Japanese relations. In a masterful report sent to the war office and senior officials throughout government, he warned that \"at present there could be no greater error than to assume, as is so often done, that Japan's military machine is too bogged down in China to prevent it being turned against us in the event of our becoming involved in a war in Europe\". Though the war office and the foreign office took little note of Boxer's warning, events proved him to have been prescient. </p> <p>During the early morning of December 8 1941, Major Boxer was in an underground post in Victoria, where he regularly monitored Japanese radio news broadcasts. Suddenly he heard, and promptly reported to his base commander, the fateful coded words that announced the beginning of the Pacific war. Following the collapse of the defence of the mainland, Boxer was one of the staff officers who greeted the retreating 2 Royal Scots as they landed on Victoria and directed them to their new defensive assignments. On two occasions (December 13 and 17 1941) he met with Japanese delegations demanding the colony's surrender, demands adamantly refused by its governor, Sir Mark Young. To the shock and dismay of suspicious observers, Boxer courteously conveyed the governor's responses in fluent Japanese accompanied by bows and salutes, in accordance with customary Japanese protocol. </p> <p>On December 20, as Japanese forces were threatening the south perimeter highway connecting the Aberdeen naval station with Stanley Peninsula, Boxer went to Repulse Bay Hotel, where casualties and refugees ware confined under close attack. Discovering that a company of the 2/14 Punjab regiment had become leaderless while trying to regain high ground near the hotel, he tried to rally the men but was shot in the back by a sniper. He was not discovered for hours. He was taken to a nearby hospital and placed in its morgue. It was assumed he would not recover but he came round. After months of hospitalisation and only partial recovery of his damaged left arm, Boxer was transferred in October 1942 to Kowloon, where he was confined with his fellow officers to the Argyle Street camp. </p> <p>There he became a contributor to a barracks magazine, Within, one of several publications the PoWs produced to divert the prisoners' attention from the depressing war reports that the Japanese disseminated in their official paper, the Hong Kong News. B y the early months of 1943 the fortunes of war in the Pacific were clearly changing, and the Japanese authorities in Hong Kong were becoming increasingly worried. The results were bloody crackdowns. First in Stanley camp, where most of the remaining western civilians were interned, and then in the three major PoW camps, Argyle Street. Shamshuipo and Ma Tau Chung. What most troubled the Japanese was the possibility of a mass breakout and that is precisely what the BAAG, the Sino-British underground in the Chinese mainland, tried to promote through surreptitiously delivered messages. Boxer was certainly involved in the planning of such a breakout at Argyle but he had absolutely no responsibility for its premature exposure which resulted in the arrest, torture and execution of the future recipients of posthumous George medals: Mateen Ahmed Ansari, Douglas Ford, Dolly Gray and Lance Newnham. </p> <p>In every PoW camp in the Far East there was a contest to control prisoners' minds. The Japanese wanted to withhold all news concerning their own setbacks, while inmate leaders were anxious to build morale by disclosing Allied victories. For a brief time, from June until late September 1943, a secret short-wave radio receiver (not a transmitter, as stated in the Saturday Review article of February 24) functioned in the Argyle Street camp, enabling Boxer and his fellow officers to accomplish their objective. At least five men, including Boxer, Commanders Douglas HS Craven and Rex Young, and Lt Herbert Charles Dixon, the radio's constructor, knew where it was hidden. But an informer - a sixth person, and certainly not Boxer, for Craven and Young would have said so in their memoirs if it had been - disclosed its existence.</p> <p> After the Japanese found it, Boxer and the others were arrested, interrogated, and sentenced to five years of hard labour. Thereafter, Boxer was confined with his fellow officers to two grim barracks, halls B and C, of Stanley Prison. They remained there from October 1943 until June 1945, when they were transferred to a Canton penitentiary. I have visited hall B and can attest to the depressing conditions throughout the prison. There is ample testimony that during his long months of solitary and later shared confinement, Charles Boxer earned the admiration of his fellow inmates. After the war, Ralph Goodwin, a remarkable camp escaper, contacted many of Boxer's prison companions in the course of writing one of his books. Goodwin wrote that they \"never ceased to marvel at the amazing fortitude and calmness of spirit that characterised his behaviour throughout their long incarceration\", adding that they remained grateful to him for his intervention with Japanese commandants in both prisons to alleviate their distress. </p> <p>Much the same testimony appears in the text of the government's first offer of an MBE to Boxer. Following liberation in August 1945, Boxer returned to duty in Hong Kong. For two frenetic months he undertook several tasks: one was to identify prospective Japanese war criminals and to assist in their roundup; a second was to discover the graves of the recipients of the four George medals and to arrange for their removal to Britain. </p> <p>According to one United States official in Hong Kong who saw him frequently, Boxer \"was truly the only man in Hong Kong with spark and drive and a passionate urge to get on with the job. [He] worked like a beaver\". A third task was to recover his missing library; a fourth was to determine whether his mistress, Emily Hahn, still wished to marry him. </p> <p>When Boxer reached the United States in late November 1945, he was interviewed by a reporter for the Los Angeles Herald Express. The resulting story began - \"international lover Major Charles Boxer was scheduled to shove off for New York today\". It quoted the \"debonair major\" as anxious to marry Emily (Mickey) Hahn \"immediately - if she'll have me\". And she did. Mickey, the author of The Song Sisters and later of a biography of Chiang Kai-shek, was also the author of a 1944 bestseller, China to Me, in which she candidly detailed their illicit romance in Shanghai and Hong Kong and the birth of their first daughter. Both Boxers were anxious to return to the Far East as quickly as possible, but the army decided otherwise. Because of the severity of Boxer's injury, he underwent surgery in the United States and repeated therapy in Oxford. It was while he was awaiting his next assignment that his wartime conduct was first impugned as a result of a faulty newspaper wire transmission from Shanghai to Hong Kong concerning one of the early war crimes trials. That report stated that the life of a US airman captured in Hong Kong might have been spared had Boxer defended him. What the army prosecutor had really said was that if Japanese authorities had permitted Japanese-speaking Boxer to assist the flyer's defence, his life might have been saved. When apprised of the discrepancy between what he said and what was transmitted, the embarrassed attorney immediately issued a correction and reassured complainants that \"you may state that my personal knowledge of Major Boxer's courageous career causes me intense personal regret that this incident has occurred\". </p> <p>In the end, the army offered Boxer command of a PoW camp of German prisoners, or that of a refugee camp of Poles. But in September 1946 he became Camoens Professor of Portuguese Studies at King's College, London. He took honourable retirement from the army in December 1947. The Camoens professorship and a later series of teaching positions in US universities, culminating in a chair at Yale, enabled Boxer to broaden the range of his already impressive scholarship. He was gifted in languages (he read with facility a half-dozen), efficient in research, had an exceptional memory, a matchless bibliographical knowledge, and tireless energy. </p> <p>After 1945 the focus of his writings, previously mainly on western activities in east Asia during the 16th and 17th centuries, shifted to encompass the Dutch and Portuguese seaborne empires from the 15th to the early 19th centuries. His remarkable publication record - about 335 articles and books - began in 1926 and continued until the early 1990s. Boxer's writing reflects his interests in the accomplishments of people, great and plebeian, free and slave. He was captivated by the doings of heroic admirals and generals, whether Dutch, English, French, or Portuguese. </p> <p>He was intrigued by the roles played by administrators, merchants, missionaries, pedlars, ships pilots, women, African and Amerindian slaves, and others who contributed fundamentally to imperial development. But Boxer was no Kipling. By the late 1930s he recognised that the days of great European empires were numbered. His conviction that the British empire was moribund was one of several reasons why he twice declined an MBE. Contrary to the previous article, Boxer was never a spymaster. He revealed nothing to his captors. He did nothing to prolong the Pacific war. The article besmirched the reputations of three estimable people - Emily Hahn, the former Ursula Tulloch and Charles Boxer - each of whom is deceased and therefore unable to rise to their own defence.</p>",

He also became proficient in kendo, the Japanese form of fencing. He travelled widely in the orient and bought many books, a practice he continued into his late 80s. After a two-year stint in Britain, mostly in the intelligence section of the war office, Boxer was posted to Hong Kong, where he arrived in 1937 and remained until 1945. Between 1937 and 1941, Boxer, promoted from captain to major, became one of the key members of the Far East Combined Bureau, a British intelligence organisation that extended from Shanghai to Singapore. By 1940, most of its Hong Kong office had been transferred to Singapore, leaving Boxer as the army's chief intelligence officer in the colony. His performance was later evaluated by Major-General GE Grimsdale. From 1939 until 1945 Grimsdale headed British army intelligence successively in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Chungking. He played a key role in the creation of the FECB and remained one of its staunch supporters. The two travelled together on trips to war-torn China. Grimsdale declared Boxer to be \"a very capable intelligence staff officer, with a quick and accurate mind and a fluent pen. I could not have wanted a better or more congenial assistant\". Boxer was, like most other prominent figures in the colony, socially very active. But he was often away. After the Japanese army occupied Canton and territory adjacent to the Kowloon mainland, Boxer frequently visited the new commandants in order to ascertain Japanese intentions. He also made several extended trips to remote parts of China. In Chungking he negotiated directly with Chiang Kai-shek to establish a Sino-British secret radio corps to monitor Japanese overflights. He regularly ferried to Macao, where he combined business (sharing intelligence with the Portuguese governor) with pleasure (archival research and conviviality). He returned to Japan on several occasions. His last pre-war visit came in mid-1939, on honeymoon following his marriage to Ursula Norah Anstice Tulloch. Later he became deeply worried about the state of Anglo-Japanese relations. In a masterful report sent to the war office and senior officials throughout government, he warned that \"at present there could be no greater error than to assume, as is so often done, that Japan's military machine is too bogged down in China to prevent it being turned against us in the event of our becoming involved in a war in Europe\". Though the war office and the foreign office took little note of Boxer's warning, events proved him to have been prescient. During the early morning of December 8 1941, Major Boxer was in an underground post in Victoria, where he regularly monitored Japanese radio news broadcasts. Suddenly he heard, and promptly reported to his base commander, the fateful coded words that announced the beginning of the Pacific war. Following the collapse of the defence of the mainland, Boxer was one of the staff officers who greeted the retreating 2 Royal Scots as they landed on Victoria and directed them to their new defensive assignments. On two occasions (December 13 and 17 1941) he met with Japanese delegations demanding the colony's surrender, demands adamantly refused by its governor, Sir Mark Young. To the shock and dismay of suspicious observers, Boxer courteously conveyed the governor's responses in fluent Japanese accompanied by bows and salutes, in accordance with customary Japanese protocol. On December 20, as Japanese forces were threatening the south perimeter highway connecting the Aberdeen naval station with Stanley Peninsula, Boxer went to Repulse Bay Hotel, where casualties and refugees ware confined under close attack. Discovering that a company of the 2/14 Punjab regiment had become leaderless while trying to regain high ground near the hotel, he tried to rally the men but was shot in the back by a sniper. He was not discovered for hours. He was taken to a nearby hospital and placed in its morgue. It was assumed he would not recover but he came round. After months of hospitalisation and only partial recovery of his damaged left arm, Boxer was transferred in October 1942 to Kowloon, where he was confined with his fellow officers to the Argyle Street camp. There he became a contributor to a barracks magazine, Within, one of several publications the PoWs produced to divert the prisoners' attention from the depressing war reports that the Japanese disseminated in their official paper, the Hong Kong News. B y the early months of 1943 the fortunes of war in the Pacific were clearly changing, and the Japanese authorities in Hong Kong were becoming increasingly worried. The results were bloody crackdowns. First in Stanley camp, where most of the remaining western civilians were interned, and then in the three major PoW camps, Argyle Street. Shamshuipo and Ma Tau Chung. What most troubled the Japanese was the possibility of a mass breakout and that is precisely what the BAAG, the Sino-British underground in the Chinese mainland, tried to promote through surreptitiously delivered messages. Boxer was certainly involved in the planning of such a breakout at Argyle but he had absolutely no responsibility for its premature exposure which resulted in the arrest, torture and execution of the future recipients of posthumous George medals: Mateen Ahmed Ansari, Douglas Ford, Dolly Gray and Lance Newnham. In every PoW camp in the Far East there was a contest to control prisoners' minds. The Japanese wanted to withhold all news concerning their own setbacks, while inmate leaders were anxious to build morale by disclosing Allied victories. For a brief time, from June until late September 1943, a secret short-wave radio receiver (not a transmitter, as stated in the Saturday Review article of February 24) functioned in the Argyle Street camp, enabling Boxer and his fellow officers to accomplish their objective. At least five men, including Boxer, Commanders Douglas HS Craven and Rex Young, and Lt Herbert Charles Dixon, the radio's constructor, knew where it was hidden. But an informer - a sixth person, and certainly not Boxer, for Craven and Young would have said so in their memoirs if it had been - disclosed its existence. After the Japanese found it, Boxer and the others were arrested, interrogated, and sentenced to five years of hard labour. Thereafter, Boxer was confined with his fellow officers to two grim barracks, halls B and C, of Stanley Prison. They remained there from October 1943 until June 1945, when they were transferred to a Canton penitentiary. I have visited hall B and can attest to the depressing conditions throughout the prison. There is ample testimony that during his long months of solitary and later shared confinement, Charles Boxer earned the admiration of his fellow inmates. After the war, Ralph Goodwin, a remarkable camp escaper, contacted many of Boxer's prison companions in the course of writing one of his books. Goodwin wrote that they \"never ceased to marvel at the amazing fortitude and calmness of spirit that characterised his behaviour throughout their long incarceration\", adding that they remained grateful to him for his intervention with Japanese commandants in both prisons to alleviate their distress. Much the same testimony appears in the text of the government's first offer of an MBE to Boxer. Following liberation in August 1945, Boxer returned to duty in Hong Kong. For two frenetic months he undertook several tasks: one was to identify prospective Japanese war criminals and to assist in their roundup; a second was to discover the graves of the recipients of the four George medals and to arrange for their removal to Britain. According to one United States official in Hong Kong who saw him frequently, Boxer \"was truly the only man in Hong Kong with spark and drive and a passionate urge to get on with the job. [He] worked like a beaver\". A third task was to recover his missing library; a fourth was to determine whether his mistress, Emily Hahn, still wished to marry him. When Boxer reached the United States in late November 1945, he was interviewed by a reporter for the Los Angeles Herald Express. The resulting story began - \"international lover Major Charles Boxer was scheduled to shove off for New York today\". It quoted the \"debonair major\" as anxious to marry Emily (Mickey) Hahn \"immediately - if she'll have me\". And she did. Mickey, the author of The Song Sisters and later of a biography of Chiang Kai-shek, was also the author of a 1944 bestseller, China to Me, in which she candidly detailed their illicit romance in Shanghai and Hong Kong and the birth of their first daughter. Both Boxers were anxious to return to the Far East as quickly as possible, but the army decided otherwise. Because of the severity of Boxer's injury, he underwent surgery in the United States and repeated therapy in Oxford. It was while he was awaiting his next assignment that his wartime conduct was first impugned as a result of a faulty newspaper wire transmission from Shanghai to Hong Kong concerning one of the early war crimes trials. That report stated that the life of a US airman captured in Hong Kong might have been spared had Boxer defended him. What the army prosecutor had really said was that if Japanese authorities had permitted Japanese-speaking Boxer to assist the flyer's defence, his life might have been saved. When apprised of the discrepancy between what he said and what was transmitted, the embarrassed attorney immediately issued a correction and reassured complainants that \"you may state that my personal knowledge of Major Boxer's courageous career causes me intense personal regret that this incident has occurred\". In the end, the army offered Boxer command of a PoW camp of German prisoners, or that of a refugee camp of Poles. But in September 1946 he became Camoens Professor of Portuguese Studies at King's College, London. He took honourable retirement from the army in December 1947. The Camoens professorship and a later series of teaching positions in US universities, culminating in a chair at Yale, enabled Boxer to broaden the range of his already impressive scholarship. He was gifted in languages (he read with facility a half-dozen), efficient in research, had an exceptional memory, a matchless bibliographical knowledge, and tireless energy. After 1945 the focus of his writings, previously mainly on western activities in east Asia during the 16th and 17th centuries, shifted to encompass the Dutch and Portuguese seaborne empires from the 15th to the early 19th centuries. His remarkable publication record - about 335 articles and books - began in 1926 and continued until the early 1990s. Boxer's writing reflects his interests in the accomplishments of people, great and plebeian, free and slave. He was captivated by the doings of heroic admirals and generals, whether Dutch, English, French, or Portuguese. He was intrigued by the roles played by administrators, merchants, missionaries, pedlars, ships pilots, women, African and Amerindian slaves, and others who contributed fundamentally to imperial development. But Boxer was no Kipling. By the late 1930s he recognised that the days of great European empires were numbered. His conviction that the British empire was moribund was one of several reasons why he twice declined an MBE. Contrary to the previous article, Boxer was never a spymaster. He revealed nothing to his captors. He did nothing to prolong the Pacific war. The article besmirched the reputations of three estimable people - Emily Hahn, the former Ursula Tulloch and Charles Boxer - each of whom is deceased and therefore unable to rise to their own defence.",

Alternating the modes of sadistic action movie, detective story, cyberpunk thriller and gentle romance, the external action of the novel is always engaging. But such is Mitchell's beautifully precise style that he can make inaction just as pleasurable, as Eiji lies alone on his bed, smoking cigarettes and watching the neon clock across the street count down the hours until dawn. The prose bespeaks a kind of observational rapture that offers the smell of Tokyo streets or even the movements of a cockroach as tiny, cherishable shards. </p> <p>Mitchell also adores larger-scale formal tricks, which are not always convincingly integrated with his subject matter. The book opens with a faintly irritating section entitled \"Panopticon\", named for the law firm where Eiji believes he will find clues to his father's identity. The reader is wrong-footed numerous times, as each elaborate attempt on the Panopticon fortress is revealed to be a figment of Eiji's nerve-shredded imagination. The third section, \"Video Games\", makes only a half-hearted attempt to mime the sensual action of the electronic arts; in its romp through Yakuza-owned hostess clubs, it quickly comes to resemble a seedy teen-buddy movie. </p> <p>It is the fifth section, however, that grates most. Entitled \"Study of Tales\", it sees Eiji hiding out in a writer's house and reading the fables she has left on her desk. With their hero Goatwriter, who is obsessed with finding the \"truly untold tale\", they are written in an insufferably fey, sing-song rhyming prose, and it becomes painfully apparent, among the superfluity of pages devoted to this arch nonsense, that we are witnessing a fable about fiction itself. \"A hoochy-koochy hooker honked. 'Stories never filled my belly!'\" Such wastebasket-fodder is symptomatic of Mitchell's greatest fault: he explains too much. The book's lovely oneiric textures seem mocked and polluted by this clunking defence of making stuff up. </p> <p>Far more successful, because less overt, are the enjoyably arrogant dabs of intertextuality: one character and one secret facility from Ghostwritten wink tangentially into life here too, and contribute a pianissimo counterpoint to Mitchell's leitmotif. His guiding thesis is a comfortingly simple one: everything is somehow interconnected, even if we don't know why. This theme is most obviously celebrated in the novel's obsessive numerology. As though it were intended as a cyborg updating of the medieval dream poem Pearl , number9dream is everywhere infected with viral nines.

As in Norwegian Wood , a woman very close to the narrator writes letters to him from a mental institution. And just as Murakami's The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (which, it is hinted, Eiji has half-read) includes a harrowing nested narration of events during the second world war, so number9dream offers pages from the diary of a Japanese torpedo pilot on a suicide mission to sink American shipping. </p> <p>It may be, however, that Murakami is a dangerous model, in the same way that Nabokov has claimed so many lesser talents as victims. Mitchell's attempt to borrow historical pathos misfires, while he simulates the gossamer naivety of Murakami's characters - especially in his curiously asexual central romance - without ever quite managing, as the Japanese novelist does, to make them resonate. Murakami conjures a tone of great poetic melancholy out of deceptively simple materials.

Orlistat will only be given to those with a body/mass index of over 30 kg/m2 or 28 kg/m2 if they have a serious illness such as diabetes or high blood pressure. Body mass index is the person's weight in kilograms divided by their height in metres squared. A BMI of 20 to 25 is normal, 25 to 30 is overweight and more than 30 is obese. A man of about 5ft 10in weighing more than 15 stone or a woman of 5ft 6in and 13.5 stone would be regarded as obese.",

      "body": "<p>Gerald Levin is a man on a mission of biblical proportions. In his early 20s, as a student of religious literature, he thought seriously about becoming a rabbi. </p> <p>Today, at the age of 61 and as head of the world's largest media company, he is preaching a message of a very different kind. His mantra is the promotion of the newly created $130bn (\u00a389bn) AOL-Time Warner, a media group that he believes has the power, literally, to change the world. </p> <p>It is an organisation that marries new media with old, has content and distribution arms across five continents, claims 130m paying subscribers and strikes fear into the hearts of competitors.</p> <p>And as far as Mr Levin is concerned it has only just got going. \"We want to be the most valuable and most respected company of any kind anywhere in the world within five years,\" he says. </p> <p>\"We're trying to make a difference in the world and there is a missionary zeal in this company. I like to see AOL-Time Warner as a laboratory for innovation and an agent for change.\"</p> <p>Had Mr Levin not taken an unsolicited call from AOL boss Steve Case 18 months ago, he would probably still be doing the rounds on Wall Street merely trying to convince investors that Time Warner would eventually \"get the internet\" and would not lose ground as technology forced different mediums to converge.</p> <p> \"Steve came on the phone and said simply 'Let's put the companies together and you can be CEO'. I said maybe we ought to have dinner because I was really unsure any of it would work. We had dinner, spent the entire time talking about values, world views and ideas and that's when it came clear to me that perhaps we should try and do it.\"</p> <p> <strong>Substance behind vision</strong></p> <p> The proposed merger was announced in January last year, turning the media world upside down and seeing the bold marriage of the internet and content described as \"deal of the century\".</p> <p> Mr Case, who is chairman of the enlarged group, took the plaudits that day but those who believed that AOL Time Warner would be his show underestimate Mr Levin. Some 20 years Mr Case's senior, and a veteran of several multi-billion dollar takeovers, Mr Levin is the substance behind the vision.</p> <p>Uncomfortable in the media spotlight and a slight, greying figure, he has often been characterised as cold and distant. Former colleagues have said he is intellectual but lacks charisma.</p> <p>In an industry where the big players are larger than life and often domineering characters such as Rupert Murdoch, Barry Diller and Sumner Redstone, Mr Levin can come across as almost dreary.</p> <p> Yet when the quiet mogul of US media speaks, people listen.

      "bodyText": "Gerald Levin is a man on a mission of biblical proportions. In his early 20s, as a student of religious literature, he thought seriously about becoming a rabbi. Today, at the age of 61 and as head of the world's largest media company, he is preaching a message of a very different kind. His mantra is the promotion of the newly created $130bn (\u00a389bn) AOL-Time Warner, a media group that he believes has the power, literally, to change the world. It is an organisation that marries new media with old, has content and distribution arms across five continents, claims 130m paying subscribers and strikes fear into the hearts of competitors. And as far as Mr Levin is concerned it has only just got going. \"We want to be the most valuable and most respected company of any kind anywhere in the world within five years,\" he says. \"We're trying to make a difference in the world and there is a missionary zeal in this company. I like to see AOL-Time Warner as a laboratory for innovation and an agent for change.\" Had Mr Levin not taken an unsolicited call from AOL boss Steve Case 18 months ago, he would probably still be doing the rounds on Wall Street merely trying to convince investors that Time Warner would eventually \"get the internet\" and would not lose ground as technology forced different mediums to converge. \"Steve came on the phone and said simply 'Let's put the companies together and you can be CEO'. I said maybe we ought to have dinner because I was really unsure any of it would work. We had dinner, spent the entire time talking about values, world views and ideas and that's when it came clear to me that perhaps we should try and do it.\" Substance behind vision The proposed merger was announced in January last year, turning the media world upside down and seeing the bold marriage of the internet and content described as \"deal of the century\". Mr Case, who is chairman of the enlarged group, took the plaudits that day but those who believed that AOL Time Warner would be his show underestimate Mr Levin. Some 20 years Mr Case's senior, and a veteran of several multi-billion dollar takeovers, Mr Levin is the substance behind the vision. Uncomfortable in the media spotlight and a slight, greying figure, he has often been characterised as cold and distant. Former colleagues have said he is intellectual but lacks charisma. In an industry where the big players are larger than life and often domineering characters such as Rupert Murdoch, Barry Diller and Sumner Redstone, Mr Levin can come across as almost dreary. Yet when the quiet mogul of US media speaks, people listen. Critics warn that the combination of Mr Levin, Mr Case and the Ted Turner as vice chairman could lead to a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth. Mr Case says the individuals are vital to serving up a feast of content and technology that spans the US's largest internet service provider, Netscape, Time magazine, Warner Records, Time Warner Cable, HBO, Fortune, Sports Illustrated and the Warner Brothers film studio. The merger was sealed just six weeks after intense regulatory scrutiny but analysts are already starting to question whether it can deliver on the aggressive targets it first outlined. A year has passed since the technology laden Nasdaq market toppled from its peak. Shares in technology and media companies show little sign of recovering their former highs. The advertising market is weakening, as popular internet portal Yahoo! warned earlier in the week, and these days it is the leaders of established media firms making the telephone calls. They are offering to put the dot.coms out of their misery. Yet Mr Levin is resolutely sticking to the hymn sheet and refuses to budge from the ambitious target of revenues of $40bn in 2001. \"I agree that most mergers fail to deliver on their promises but in this case we have a position, assets and people that are so profound and we're talking about growth rates that are so significant that we're looking at something that will be a one-of-a-kind company.\" He says the fees the company generates from AOL subscriptions and pay-TV sub sidiaries such as HBO should keep revenue levels stable. Observers say Mr Levin faces an uphill task integrating what are perceived to be two very different work cultures that developed at AOL and Time Warner. \"In a way we're fortunate, because in the year and a day that it took us to close this deal we spent a lot of time talking about the same values and the same subscription formats and I feel very comfortable that we have very committed people.\" A large part of that commitment is to changing the world. \"Making a difference is very important to the the kind of people who have been attracted to this company. There is a sense of destiny here and the job is not just about a pay cheque. \"We have an obligation to participate in the formation of public policy and its not just because we affect people around the world or that the internet is a global medium. I really think companies have the resources and the skill to do so. \"Frankly, there is a lack of leadership in the public sector and education. There's no conflict with the financial interests of shareholders because if you've got committed people who really believe in the mission of the company then their performance is going to reflect that. \"Henry Luce, the founder of Time Inc, put in his will that the company should be operated not only in the interest of shareholders but in the public interest. We've taken that as a rubric for our company. \"This is going to be a completely new kind of media company simply because when you blend in the internet activities with the advanced media you saw at Time Warner you create something entirely new.\" Desire to develop That Mr Case is seen as the AOL-Time Warner front man will not surprise Mr Levin. He is used to being written off and has made a habit of proving his detractors wrong. Ever since he took over as chief executive of Time Warner in 1992, rivals started to whisper that Mr Levin would not be in the job for long. Instead he has built a reputation as one of the industry's shrewdest operators and greatest survivors. In 1997 he even had to overcome the personal tragedy of losing his youngest son Jonathan, a teacher who was shot dead by one of his pupils. Born in Philadelphia and twice married, Mr Levin joined Time in 1972 after a year working for the International Basic Economy Corporation in Tehran. For all Mr Levin's talk of AOL-Time Warner's plans for world domination, only 20% of its revenues come from outside the US. It is something he plans to address quickly and he was in Britain earlier this week on a profile-raising trip that involved speaking to business leaders at an event organised by the London Business School. \"Europe is central to us and is at the top of our list in terms of our strategy and desire to develop.\" While Mr Levin was in London, speculation on Wall Street centred on his long-term future and whether he plans to retire - but with a rare smile he describes his new role as \"about as good as it gets\". Expect him to keep the faith a while longer. The CV Born: Born in Philadelphia on May 6, 1939 Education: Graduated from Haverford College - where he studied theology - in 1960.

It was the instantly recognisable voice of a Bilderberg founder member, for 30 years one of their inner circle, their steering committee, a Bilderberg agenda setter, a head-hunter - a secret ruler of the world himself, should you choose to believe the assorted militants I had spent the past five years with. It was Denis Healey.</p> <p>\"How can I help you?\" he said.</p> <p>\"Well,\" I said, \"would you tell me what happens inside Bilderberg meetings?\"</p> <p>\"Okay,\" he said, cheerfully.</p> <p>There was a silence.</p> <p>\"Why?\" I said. \"Nobody else will.\"</p> <p>\"Because you asked me,\" he said. Then he added, \"I'm an old fart. Come on over.\"</p> <p>Once Lord Healey had agreed to talk to me - and I had circulated this information far and wide - other Bilderberg members became amenable, too (albeit on the condition of anonymity). These interviews enabled me to piece together the backstage mechanics of this most secret society.</p> <p>So this is how it works. A tiny, shoe-string central office in Holland decides each year which country will host the next meeting. Each country has two steering committee members. (The British ones have included Lord Carrington, Denis Healey, Andrew Knight, the one-time editor of The Economist magazine, and Martin Taylor, the ex-CEO of Barclays Bank.)</p> <p>They say that each country dreads their turn coming around, for they have to raise enough money to book an entire five-star hotel for four days (plus meals and transport and vast security - every packet of peas is opened and scrutinised, and so on). They call up Bilderberg-friendly global corporations, such as Xerox or Heinz or Fiat or Barclays or Nokia, which donate the hundreds of thousands of pounds needed. They do not accept unsolicited donations from non-Bilderberg corporations.</p> <p>Nobody can buy their way into a Bilderberg meeting, although many corporations have tried. Then they decide who to invite - who seems to be a \"Bilderberg person\". The notion of a Bilderberg person hasn't changed since the earliest days, back in 1954, when the group was created by Denis Healey, Joseph Retinger, David Rockefeller and Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands (a former SS officer while he was a student - ironic that a former Nazi, albeit a low-ranking and half-hearted one, would help give birth to an organisation that so many would consider to be evidence of a Jewish conspiracy).</p> <p>\"First off,\" said a steering committee member to me, \"the invited guests must sing for their supper. They can't just sit there like church mice. They are there to speak. I remember when I invited Margaret Thatcher back in '75. She wasn't worldly. Well, she sat there for the first two days and didn't say a thing. People started grumbling. A senator came up to me on the Friday night, Senator Mathias of Maryland. He said, 'This lady you invited, she hasn't said a word. You really ought to say something to her.' So I had a quiet word with her at dinner. She was embarrassed. Well, she obviously thought about it overnight, because the next day she suddenly stood up and launched into a three-minute Thatcher special. I can't remember the topic, but you can imagine. The room was stunned. Here's something for your conspiracy theorists. As a result of that speech, David Rockefeller and Henry Kissinger and the other Americans fell in love with her. They brought her over to America, took her around in limousines, and introduced her to everyone.</p> <p>\"I remember when Clinton came in '91,\" he added. \"Vernon Jordan invited him along. He used it as a one-stop-shop. He went around glad-handing everyone. Nobody thought they were meeting the next president.\" (Of course, Jim Tucker would contend that they all knew they were meeting the next president - for they huddled together that weekend and decided he would be the next president.) At times, I become nostalgic for when I knew nothing. There are so few mysteries left, and here I am, I presume, relegating Bilderberg to the dingy world of the known. The invited guests are not allowed to bring their wives, girlfriends or - on rarer occasions - their husbands or boyfriends. Their security officers cannot attend the conference and must have dinner in a separate hall. The guests are expressly asked not to give interviews to journalists. Rooms, refreshments, wine and cocktails before dinner are paid for by Bilderberg. Telephone, room service and laundry bills are paid for by the participants. There are two morning sessions and two afternoon sessions, except on the Saturday, when the sessions take place only in the evening so that the Bilderbergers can play golf. The seating plan is in alphabetical order. It is reversed each year. One year Umberto Agnelli, the chairman of Fiat, will sit at the front. The next year, Norbert Zimmermann, chairman of Berndorf, the Austrian cutlery and metalware manufacturer, will take his place. While furiously denying that they secretly ruled the world, my Bilderberg interviewees did admit to me that international affairs had, from time to time, been influenced by these sessions.</p> <p>I asked for examples, and I was given one: \"During the Falklands war, the British government's request for international sanctions against Argentina fell on stony ground. But at a Bilderberg meeting in, I think, Denmark, David Owen stood up and gave the most fiery speech in favour of imposing them. Well, the speech changed a lot of minds. I'm sure that various foreign ministers went back to their respective countries and told their leaders what David Owen had said. And you know what? Sanctions were imposed.\"</p> <p>The man who told me this story added, </p> <p>\"I hope that gives you a flavour of what really does go on in Bilderberg meetings.\"</p> <p>This is how Denis Healey described a Bilderberg person to me: \"To say we were striving for a one-world government is exaggerated, but not wholly unfair. Those of us in Bilderberg felt we couldn't go on forever fighting one another for nothing and killing people and rendering millions homeless. So we felt that a single community throughout the world would be a good thing.\"</p> <p>He said, \"Bilderberg is a way of bringing together politicians, industrialists, financiers and journalists. Politics should involve people who aren't politicians. We make a point of getting along younger politicians who are obviously rising, to bring them together with financiers and industrialists who offer them wise words. It increases the chance of having a sensible global policy.\"</p> <p>\"Does going help your career?\" I asked.</p> <p>\"Oh yes,\" he said. Then he added, \"Your new understanding of the world will certainly help your career.\"</p> <p>\"Which sounds like a conspiracy,\" I said.</p> <p>\"Crap!\" said Denis Healey. \"Idiocy! Crap! I've never heard such crap! That isn't a conspiracy! That is the world. It is the way things are done. And quite rightly so.\"</p> <p>He added, \"But I will tell you this. If extremists and leaders of militant groups believe that Bilderberg is out to do them down, then they're right. We are. We are against Islamic fundamentalism, for instance, because it's against democracy.\"</p> <p>\"Isn't Bilderberg's secrecy against democracy, too?\" I asked.</p> <p>\"We aren't secret,\" he snapped. \"We're private. Nobody is going to speak freely if they're going to be quoted by ambitious and prurient journalists like you who think it'll help your career to attack something that you have no knowledge of.\" I noticed a collection of photo albums on his mantelpiece. Denis Healey has always been a keen amateur photographer, so I asked him if he'd ever taken any pictures inside Bilderberg. \"Oh yes,\" he said. \"Lots and lots of photographs.\" I eyed the albums. Actually seeing the pictures, seeing the set-up, the faces, the mood - that would be something.</p> <p>\"Could I have a look at them?\" I asked him. Lord Healey looked down at his lap. He thought about my request. He looked up again. \"No,\" he said. \"Fuck off.\" </p> <p>\u00a9 Jon Ronson, 2001.

The dangerous ones would be those you don't know are following you.\"</p> <p>But this was scant comfort. What if these men were the dangerous ones, and I just happened to be naturally good at spotting them? What if I was adept at this?</p> <p>\"But that isn't logical,\" I said. \"Big Jim Tucker is obviously not intimidated. I don't think they'd waste their time trying to intimidate us when it is quite obviously failing.\"</p> <p>\"You sound a little intimidated, if you don't mind me saying,\" said Sandra.</p> <p>Two hours passed. Jim and I reconvened at a hotel bar down the road. As I wandered through the lobby, two men in dark suits immediately grabbed brochures and began scrutinising them. I found Jim some yards away, staring into his beer glass. \"There are two men by the door,\" I said, \"reading brochures.\"</p> <p>\"I see them,\" said Jim.</p> <p> \"They're only pretending to read brochures.\"</p> <p>\"How do you know?\" said Jim.</p> <p>\"You can tell by their demeanour,\" I said.</p> <p>\"Here's the plan,\" said Jim. \"We leave the bar together. When we get within earshot of the chasers, I say, 'I'm gonna meet my Bilderberg contact at the Tiny Bar.' You say, 'Shhh.' Say it urgently, as if you don't want them to overhear. Feed them disinformation.\"</p> <p>\"I'm not going to do that,\" I said. Jim and I left the bar together.</p> <p>\"Jon,\" said Jim loudly, \"I'm gonna meet my secret Bilderberg contact at the Tiny Bar.\"</p> <p>I scowled, said nothing and marched ahead.</p> <p>\"Very good,\" murmured Jim outside. </p> <p>We split up. I walked down to the beach and found a seafood restaurant. I do not think I was followed there. When I returned some hours later to the bar of the Paris Hotel, Jim was drunker than any man I've ever seen. </p> <p>He was surrounded by four Danish ladies and they were all singing Yes, We Have No Bananas.</p> <p>\"Jim,\" I said, urgently, \"are you still being followed?\" I coughed. \"Sorry, ladies,\" I said.</p> <p>\"Excuse me, ladies,\" said Jim, bowing graciously. He turned to me.</p> <p>\"So what happened?\" I said.</p> <p>\"I went to the Tiny Bar,\" he said. \"They call it the Tiny Bar because it is a tiny bar.\"</p> <p>\"And did they follow you there?\"</p> <p>\". . . We have string beans and onions/Cabbages and scallions . . .\"</p> <p>\"I'm a superstitious old boy,\" said Jim. </p> <p>He paused. \"Abe Lincoln was a good man. Shame he was an abolitionist. Well, I guess nobody's perfect. I've lost my train of thought.\"</p> <p>\"You went to the Tiny Bar,\" I prompted.</p> <p>\"So, I'm a superstitious boy and I never sit with my back to the door. Don't want to end up like old Abe Lincoln. But I didn't want them to know, see, that I knew they were there.\"</p> <p>\"And were they there?\"</p> <p>\"I don't know,\" said Jim. \"I had my back to the door. Ha ha ha ha ha!\"</p> <p>Jim nearly fell off his chair laughing.</p> <p>\"Jim,\" I said, sternly, \"when you left, were you followed?\"</p> <p>\"Who'd want to follow an old boy like me?\" said Jim. \"The amount of pills they make me take for my plumbing, anyone would think I was FAG positive.\"</p> <p>\"Jim!\" I said, startled. \"That's a terrible thing to say.\"</p> <p>\"I'm a Neanderthal,\" said Jim. \"Grrrrr.\"</p> <p>Early the next morning, a Do Not Disturb sign hung on Jim's door, and sounds of typing echoed down the corridor.</p> <p>A frosty atmosphere had developed between Jim and myself this past day or so. The tension was driving us apart. I was ready to sell Jim out to save my own skin, and I felt that Jim, invigorated by the chase, was grabbing my hand and jumping blindly into dangerous waters. We had an appointment with Paul Luckman, the editor of the tiny English-language Weekly News, the Algarve parish newspaper that had stuck its neck out and gone big on the Bilderberg story. Paul's was the only newspaper in Portugal - indeed, the only newspaper in the world, as far as I could tell - that was reporting the Bilderberg story.</p> <p>Paul is an ex-pat from England, 15 years an Algarve resident. He is not a journalist by trade. He runs a small telephone company. The Weekly News is a hobby for him, his wife, Madeline, and their two friends from church, Fred and Brendan. Paul told me he was perplexed that their parish journal had stumbled on to a world exclusive on this explosive, baffling story. \"I do not consider myself one of the world's greatest thinkers,\" he said over the phone, \"but it doesn't take much to work out that this is something genuine. And no other newspaper will touch it. Nobody. The conversation dies as soon as you say the word Bilderberg. I mentioned it to an editor on the Daily Express yesterday, and he immediately changed the subject. I said, 'Did you hear what I said?' 'Yes.' 'Do you know about Bilderberg?' 'I've, uh, heard of them.' And that was it. The conversation died.\"</p> <p>\"How did you hear about Bilderberg?\" I asked him.</p> <p>\"From a little newspaper on the internet called the Spotlight,\" he said. \"Have you heard of them?\"</p> <p>\"I'm actually here in Portugal with Big Jim Tucker,\" I said.</p> <p>\"Oh!\" he said. \"He's a hero. Bring him along.\"</p> <p>***</p> <p>Paul has a little office in a modern glass building in central Lisbon where he conducts his telephone business. He's a committed born-again Christian. Church posters decorate the walls. \"I find myself out of my depth,\" he said, twisting an elastic band around his fingers. \"If what they're up to is perfectly innocent, why don't they say what's going on? But they don't. Not even a little bit. Not even a hint. Nothing.\" Paul paused. \"Maybe my head's gone,\" he said, \"but the Book of Revelation speaks of a one-world order, one financial order, a one-world religion. There'll be a sense of disorder, of children not respecting their parents, and then a very powerful group will form. So it does all fit together.\"</p> <p>\"I know they're bad guys,\" said Jim, \"and I hate them, but I don't believe they're satanist.\"</p> <p>\"I believe that Paul's not saying they're satanist,\" I said. \"He's saying they're actually Satan.\"</p> <p>The next morning, Paul sent Fred and Brendan, his fellow Weekly News editors, to meet Jim and me outside the gates of the Caesar Park. This was the day Jim said the limousines and the helicopters would arrive. If any of us still had doubts, Jim said, if any of us still didn't believe, today was the day we would realise that the world was nothing like we had been told it was, that it turned on a sinister axis. The four of us waited out in the heat. A Gypsy caravan trotted past, then a few hikers. An hour trundled slowly by, and we filled in the time with small talk. \"So, Paul thinks Bilderberg represents the fulfilment of the Book of Revelation,\" I said to Fred. He chuckled. \"Well, that's where Paul and I part company.\" We both laughed.</p> <p>\"You see,\" said Fred, \"I believe that all the prophecies have already been fulfilled.\" There was a small silence.</p> <p>\"Oh,\" I said.</p> <p>Another hour passed. We ran out of mineral water. We kicked the gravel.</p> <p>\"They'll be here,\" said Jim, but now even he seemed unsure. He wiped the sweat from his forehead with a silk handkerchief. Our shirts were soaked. We stopped talking to each other and just stood there. Portugal is not an eventful country. There is tourism and there is football and there are golfing tournaments. It was, then, all the more extraordinary that, at around four o'clock, many of the world's most powerful people really did begin to roll past us in taxis and anonymous town cars. There was David Rockefeller, net worth $2.5 billion, chairman of the Chase Manhattan bank, huddled into the back of a local cab.</p> <p>\"Good afternoon, Mr Rockefeller,\" murmured Jim. The gatekeeper bowed and lifted the gate. Rockefeller waved, and the taxi disappeared up the drive.</p> <p>Then came Umberto Agnelli of Fiat, Italy's de facto royal family, net worth $3.3bn, barely noticeable in the back seat of some old sedan. \"Big Bilderberg family,\" said Jim. He was trying to remain matter-of-fact, but pretty soon he was grinning broadly.</p> <p>\"Jim!\" I said.</p> <p>\"Damn right, soldier,\" he beamed. \"Pretty overwhelming, huh?\"</p> <p>There was Vernon Jordan, Bill Clinton's close friend, his unelected unofficial adviser and golfing partner - Vernon Jordan, who plucked the president from Arkansas obscurity and nurtured him to the White House, and who is widely credited with pulling strings to get James Wolfensohn his job as president of the World Bank.</p> <p>There was James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank. \"Incredible,\" murmured Fred. \"Unbelievable.\"</p> <p>And there was Henry Kissinger, possibly the most powerful individual the postwar world has known: Dr Kissinger, who sanctioned the secret bombing of Cambodia and later won the Nobel Peace Prize, who revealed to the press his heart attack with the words, \"Well, at least that proves I have a heart\" - and here he was trundling up the drive of the Caesar Park in the back of an old Mercedes.</p> <p>\"I'll tell you one thing, I bet you didn't know about Henry Kissinger,\" said Jim. \"His accent is as American as mine. Creep up on him at a bar, as I once did, and whisper that you know exactly what he's up to, and he'll splutter and shout at you in an accent as American as Mom's apple pie.\"</p> <p>I attempted, for a moment, to judge rationally whether there was any truth to this startling claim - whether Kissinger really had throughout his life adopted a fake European accent to camouflage his American one. But I couldn't. My rationality had suffered a tremendous blow, and I now no longer knew what was possible and what was not.</p> <p>The taxis kept coming. There were CEOs of pharmaceutical giants and tobacco companies and car manufacturers, the heads of banks from Europe and North America. Some, like Richard Holbrooke, America's United Nations representative, gave us friendly smiles, which Jim returned with a glare of undisguised loathing.</p> <p>\"Who are these people?\" said Fred. \"Why does nobody want to know?\"</p> <p>\"They're the masters of the universe,\" said Jim. \"The rulers of the world. You know their names now.\"</p> <p>There was Conrad Black, the world's third biggest media magnate, the owner of the Daily Telegraph and the Jerusalem Post and the Chicago Sun-Times and 40 Canadian dailies and 447 other newspapers around the world. Conrad Black, who, when asked what epitaph he would like, replied, \"Just my name and dates. The more exalted a person, the less is written on their tombstone. Charles de Gaulle just has his name and dates, Winston Churchill has the same, Otto von Bismarck has only his last name, and Napoleon Bonaparte has only the letter 'N' with no dates at all. This was a man sure of his place in history, and now I felt that perhaps I understood why.\"</p> <p>An old bus cruised up the drive. I paid it little attention, assuming it was full of hotel workers. Only Brendan scrutinised the occupants. I glanced over. Brendan seemed frozen to the spot.</p> <p>\"Brendan?\" I said.</p> <p>\"Brendan!\" said Fred, sharply. \"What is it?\"</p> <p>\"I looked through the window,\" he explained, finally, \"and I focused on one person, and he was staring back at me. I was standing with my camera in hand, and this person . . . just stared.\"</p> <p>\"What kind of stare was it?\" I asked.</p> <p>\"It was a strange stare,\" he said. \"It was a different type of stare. Yes. He looked down at me. As if he was staring right through me.\" There was a pause. \"I couldn't even lift my camera.\"</p> <p>\"And who was it?\" I asked.</p> <p>Then Brendan said, softly, \"It was Peter Mandelson.\"</p> <p>There was a long silence.</p> <p>\"Peter Mandelson?\" I said.</p> <p>\"I've never seen a stare quite like it,\" said Brendan.</p> <p>\"Who's Peter Mandelson?\" said Jim.</p> <p>There was nothing left for us to do, so we got lunch. We lavished praise upon Big Jim, who grinned with satisfaction. He had, indeed, uncovered something extraordinary. Fred half-joked that Jim should win a Pulitzer, except Pulitzer was probably in Bilderberg's hands. We went back to our hotels to freshen up, and after a while Jim called to ask, if I had a moment, would I mind meeting him in his room? There seemed to be something on Jim's mind.</p> <p>\"We can only wonder what evil things they're doing in there right now,\" he said, lighting a cigarette. </p> <p>\"They've only just arrived,\" I said, lighting one. too. \"They're probably showering.\" There was a pause. \"So what is it, Jim?\" I said.</p> <p>And then Jim dropped his bombshell - he was calling off the midnight penetration. \"When I was at the Tiny Bar last night,\" he explained, \"I met this taxi driver. Local guy. Knew the terrain. I said I'd give him a hundred dollars to escort me through the undergrowth and up the drainpipes. 'One hundred crisp American dollars,' I said to him. 'Buy the wife that red dress she's always wanted.' \"</p> <p>Jim paused to cough. He had a coughing fit. He lit a cigarette. I lit one, too.</p> <p>\"Anyway,\" resumed Jim after he had drunk a glass of water, \"the taxi driver called just now. He said his wife wasn't going to let him go. Too dangerous, she said. She didn't want him killed. Poor fool.\"</p> <p>Jim looked out of the window. \"I'm sorry,\" he said.</p> <p>Jim gazed out at the traffic and the ocean beyond. He pulled on his cigarette. As I watched him, I considered the cancellation of the midnight penetration. Jim was never without a cigarette. He didn't like to admit it, but his lungs were shot. His health was no longer a match for drainpipes and guard dogs and armed security. Bill Clinton's best friend Vernon Jordan was there, 13 years a director of America's second-largest cigarette manufacturer, RJR Nabisco. I was sure that it was Jim's rattling, cigarette-induced emphysema that had put paid to his midnight penetration. I went back to my own room and lay on my bed. I drifted off for a while, and then I was woken by the telephone. It was Fred from the Weekly News. He said he had something of great importance to tell me. Could I meet him at once at his hotel?</p> <p>\"Just come as fast as you can,\" said Fred. \"I'll meet you by the pool. And don't bring your friend Jim Tucker.\"</p> <p>At the poolside of the Hotel California, Fred held a document. The document was screwed up in his hand and damp with sweat. Fred said that he had discovered something terrible in the hours that had passed since our lunch.</p> <p>\"Okay,\" said Fred, \"I returned to my hotel and I had a swim and then I went to my room and began surfing on the internet. And after a while I found this . . .\"</p> <p>Fred passed me the document. I uncreased it and laid it on the table.</p> <p><strong>Bilderberg material is fascist hoax!</strong></p> <p>Dear friends,</p> <p>I am writing to you urgently to warn you about material being circulated about a 'Bilderberg Conference' due to take place in June in Portugal. The Washington-based journal Spotlight is quoted as a source of information on the Bilderberg Conference. Spotlight is published by the fascist Liberty Lobby. The purpose of the material appears to be to make people imagine there is a sinister Jewish conspiracy that is trying to dominate the world. You may find much information on Spotlight by contacting any major anti-fascist organization.</p> <p>Against fascism and against capitalism, Lisa Taylor (International Solidarity with Workers in Russia).</p> <p>\"What do you think about that?\" said Fred.</p> <p>There was a long silence.</p> <p>\"Well,\" I said. \"I should tell you that the other night Jim told me it was a shame that Abraham Lincoln was an abolitionist.\"</p> <p>\"Did he?\" said Fred, clearly startled.</p> <p>\"But I can't really think of anything else Jim said that might be construed as . . . oh, he did say that with the amount of pills they make him take for his plumbing, anyone would think he was . . .\"</p> <p>\"We're getting all our information from neo-Nazis?\" interrupted Fred. \"We're publishing a newspaper all over Portugal and our sources are neo-Nazis?\"</p> <p>\"You might be,\" I said. \"But that doesn't mean . . .\" I paused.</p> <p>Fred looked out at the pool. Children were splashing around. It was a lovely day. He put his head in his hands.</p> <p>\"What,\" he said, \"have we got ourselves into?\"</p> <p>In my attempts to find out whether the world really was being secretly ruled from inside the Caesar Park golfing resort that June weekend, I later contacted dozens of Bilderberg members. And, of course, nobody returned my calls. Nobody even wrote back to decline my request and thank me for my letter, and these are people whose people always write back and decline requests - Peter Mandelson's office, for instance - which is why I began to envisage these silences as startled ones.</p> <p>I did manage to speak to David Rockefeller's press secretary, who told me that Mr Rockefeller was thoroughly fed up with being called a 12ft lizard, a secret ruler of the world, a keeper of black helicopters that spy on anti-Bilderberg dissenters, and so on.</p> <p>The Rockefeller office seemed to have an encyclopaedic knowledge of the conspiracy theories. They troubled Mr Rockefeller (his press man said). They made him wonder why some people are so scared and suspicious of him, in particular, and global think-tanks such as Bilderberg in general. Mr Rockefeller's conclusion was that this was a battle between rational and irrational thought. Rational people favoured globalisation. Irrational people preferred nationalism. I asked him why he thought no Bilderberg member had returned my calls or answered my letters. \"Well,\" he shrugged, \"I suppose it's because they might want to be invited back.\"</p> <p>I persevered. I wanted the information. </p> <p>I felt I deserved to have the information, and I simply couldn't believe that there was certain information that I couldn't get my hands on. It was driving me crazy. I learnt that being followed around by a man in dark glasses was tame in comparison with the indignities suffered by some of the few prying journalists who had travelled this road before me. In June 1998, a Scottish reporter tracked Bilderberg to the Turnberry Hotel in Ayrshire, and when he started asking questions he was promptly handcuffed by Strathclyde police and thrown into jail. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/books/extracts/story/0,6761,449320,00.html\">Continued</a></p>",

He was trying to remain matter-of-fact, but pretty soon he was grinning broadly. \"Jim!\" I said. \"Damn right, soldier,\" he beamed. \"Pretty overwhelming, huh?\" There was Vernon Jordan, Bill Clinton's close friend, his unelected unofficial adviser and golfing partner - Vernon Jordan, who plucked the president from Arkansas obscurity and nurtured him to the White House, and who is widely credited with pulling strings to get James Wolfensohn his job as president of the World Bank. There was James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank. \"Incredible,\" murmured Fred. \"Unbelievable.\" And there was Henry Kissinger, possibly the most powerful individual the postwar world has known: Dr Kissinger, who sanctioned the secret bombing of Cambodia and later won the Nobel Peace Prize, who revealed to the press his heart attack with the words, \"Well, at least that proves I have a heart\" - and here he was trundling up the drive of the Caesar Park in the back of an old Mercedes. \"I'll tell you one thing, I bet you didn't know about Henry Kissinger,\" said Jim. \"His accent is as American as mine. Creep up on him at a bar, as I once did, and whisper that you know exactly what he's up to, and he'll splutter and shout at you in an accent as American as Mom's apple pie.\" I attempted, for a moment, to judge rationally whether there was any truth to this startling claim - whether Kissinger really had throughout his life adopted a fake European accent to camouflage his American one. But I couldn't. My rationality had suffered a tremendous blow, and I now no longer knew what was possible and what was not. The taxis kept coming. There were CEOs of pharmaceutical giants and tobacco companies and car manufacturers, the heads of banks from Europe and North America. Some, like Richard Holbrooke, America's United Nations representative, gave us friendly smiles, which Jim returned with a glare of undisguised loathing. \"Who are these people?\" said Fred. \"Why does nobody want to know?\" \"They're the masters of the universe,\" said Jim. \"The rulers of the world. You know their names now.\" There was Conrad Black, the world's third biggest media magnate, the owner of the Daily Telegraph and the Jerusalem Post and the Chicago Sun-Times and 40 Canadian dailies and 447 other newspapers around the world. Conrad Black, who, when asked what epitaph he would like, replied, \"Just my name and dates. The more exalted a person, the less is written on their tombstone. Charles de Gaulle just has his name and dates, Winston Churchill has the same, Otto von Bismarck has only his last name, and Napoleon Bonaparte has only the letter 'N' with no dates at all. This was a man sure of his place in history, and now I felt that perhaps I understood why.\" An old bus cruised up the drive. I paid it little attention, assuming it was full of hotel workers. Only Brendan scrutinised the occupants. I glanced over. Brendan seemed frozen to the spot. \"Brendan?\" I said. \"Brendan!\" said Fred, sharply. \"What is it?\" \"I looked through the window,\" he explained, finally, \"and I focused on one person, and he was staring back at me. I was standing with my camera in hand, and this person . . . just stared.\" \"What kind of stare was it?\" I asked. \"It was a strange stare,\" he said. \"It was a different type of stare. Yes. He looked down at me. As if he was staring right through me.\" There was a pause. \"I couldn't even lift my camera.\" \"And who was it?\" I asked. Then Brendan said, softly, \"It was Peter Mandelson.\" There was a long silence. \"Peter Mandelson?\" I said. \"I've never seen a stare quite like it,\" said Brendan. \"Who's Peter Mandelson?\" said Jim. There was nothing left for us to do, so we got lunch. We lavished praise upon Big Jim, who grinned with satisfaction. He had, indeed, uncovered something extraordinary. Fred half-joked that Jim should win a Pulitzer, except Pulitzer was probably in Bilderberg's hands. We went back to our hotels to freshen up, and after a while Jim called to ask, if I had a moment, would I mind meeting him in his room? There seemed to be something on Jim's mind. \"We can only wonder what evil things they're doing in there right now,\" he said, lighting a cigarette. \"They've only just arrived,\" I said, lighting one. too. \"They're probably showering.\" There was a pause. \"So what is it, Jim?\" I said. And then Jim dropped his bombshell - he was calling off the midnight penetration. \"When I was at the Tiny Bar last night,\" he explained, \"I met this taxi driver. Local guy. Knew the terrain. I said I'd give him a hundred dollars to escort me through the undergrowth and up the drainpipes. 'One hundred crisp American dollars,' I said to him. 'Buy the wife that red dress she's always wanted.' \" Jim paused to cough. He had a coughing fit. He lit a cigarette. I lit one, too. \"Anyway,\" resumed Jim after he had drunk a glass of water, \"the taxi driver called just now. He said his wife wasn't going to let him go. Too dangerous, she said. She didn't want him killed. Poor fool.\" Jim looked out of the window. \"I'm sorry,\" he said. Jim gazed out at the traffic and the ocean beyond. He pulled on his cigarette. As I watched him, I considered the cancellation of the midnight penetration. Jim was never without a cigarette. He didn't like to admit it, but his lungs were shot. His health was no longer a match for drainpipes and guard dogs and armed security. Bill Clinton's best friend Vernon Jordan was there, 13 years a director of America's second-largest cigarette manufacturer, RJR Nabisco. I was sure that it was Jim's rattling, cigarette-induced emphysema that had put paid to his midnight penetration. I went back to my own room and lay on my bed. I drifted off for a while, and then I was woken by the telephone. It was Fred from the Weekly News. He said he had something of great importance to tell me. Could I meet him at once at his hotel? \"Just come as fast as you can,\" said Fred. \"I'll meet you by the pool. And don't bring your friend Jim Tucker.\" At the poolside of the Hotel California, Fred held a document. The document was screwed up in his hand and damp with sweat. Fred said that he had discovered something terrible in the hours that had passed since our lunch. \"Okay,\" said Fred, \"I returned to my hotel and I had a swim and then I went to my room and began surfing on the internet. And after a while I found this . . .\" Fred passed me the document. I uncreased it and laid it on the table. Bilderberg material is fascist hoax! Dear friends, I am writing to you urgently to warn you about material being circulated about a 'Bilderberg Conference' due to take place in June in Portugal. The Washington-based journal Spotlight is quoted as a source of information on the Bilderberg Conference. Spotlight is published by the fascist Liberty Lobby. The purpose of the material appears to be to make people imagine there is a sinister Jewish conspiracy that is trying to dominate the world. You may find much information on Spotlight by contacting any major anti-fascist organization. Against fascism and against capitalism, Lisa Taylor (International Solidarity with Workers in Russia). \"What do you think about that?\" said Fred. There was a long silence. \"Well,\" I said. \"I should tell you that the other night Jim told me it was a shame that Abraham Lincoln was an abolitionist.\" \"Did he?\" said Fred, clearly startled. \"But I can't really think of anything else Jim said that might be construed as . . . oh, he did say that with the amount of pills they make him take for his plumbing, anyone would think he was . . .\" \"We're getting all our information from neo-Nazis?\" interrupted Fred. \"We're publishing a newspaper all over Portugal and our sources are neo-Nazis?\" \"You might be,\" I said. \"But that doesn't mean . . .\" I paused. Fred looked out at the pool. Children were splashing around. It was a lovely day. He put his head in his hands. \"What,\" he said, \"have we got ourselves into?\" In my attempts to find out whether the world really was being secretly ruled from inside the Caesar Park golfing resort that June weekend, I later contacted dozens of Bilderberg members. And, of course, nobody returned my calls. Nobody even wrote back to decline my request and thank me for my letter, and these are people whose people always write back and decline requests - Peter Mandelson's office, for instance - which is why I began to envisage these silences as startled ones. I did manage to speak to David Rockefeller's press secretary, who told me that Mr Rockefeller was thoroughly fed up with being called a 12ft lizard, a secret ruler of the world, a keeper of black helicopters that spy on anti-Bilderberg dissenters, and so on. The Rockefeller office seemed to have an encyclopaedic knowledge of the conspiracy theories. They troubled Mr Rockefeller (his press man said). They made him wonder why some people are so scared and suspicious of him, in particular, and global think-tanks such as Bilderberg in general. Mr Rockefeller's conclusion was that this was a battle between rational and irrational thought. Rational people favoured globalisation. Irrational people preferred nationalism. I asked him why he thought no Bilderberg member had returned my calls or answered my letters. \"Well,\" he shrugged, \"I suppose it's because they might want to be invited back.\" I persevered. I wanted the information. I felt I deserved to have the information, and I simply couldn't believe that there was certain information that I couldn't get my hands on. It was driving me crazy. I learnt that being followed around by a man in dark glasses was tame in comparison with the indignities suffered by some of the few prying journalists who had travelled this road before me. In June 1998, a Scottish reporter tracked Bilderberg to the Turnberry Hotel in Ayrshire, and when he started asking questions he was promptly handcuffed by Strathclyde police and thrown into jail.

      "body": "<p> At the National Press Club on Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington DC, Big Jim Tucker left a coded message on the answer-machine of a friend. \"Mother. Your dutiful son is playing kick the can on Pennsylvania Avenue, Tuesday morning, 10.30am, thank you.\" </p> <p>Big Jim replaced the telephone receiver. He lit a cigarette and glanced around the lobby with a routine vigilance. Even here at his club, his gentleman's club, he considered himself not entirely safe. Anyone could discover that this was where he had breakfast every day: three strong black coffees and some pastries on the side. </p> <p>\"If they ever got me,\" he said, \"they'd make it look like a typical Washington mugging. A mugging on the sidewalk. Killed for a couple of dollars. Another three paragraphs in the newspaper.\" </p> <p>Jim paused. He pulled on his cigarette. His heart is not strong due to his habit of smoking unfiltered Camels at all times, pack after pack. He is quite huge, an elderly southern gentleman in a crumpled suit and a newshound trilby. He has a voice like gravel (a result of cigarette-induced emphysema, which, by a happy accident, gives his speech an enigmatic rhythm, like a charismatic Sam Spade down on his luck) and an office downtown with Venetian blinds. </p> <p>He said, \"The thing is, we don't know how much time we've got left. And suppose I just so happen to 'drop dead' in my office on Tuesday afternoon. It could be the following Monday before someone says, 'Where is that boy?' I don't want to be burnt bacon when they find me. I guess I'm just too vain to be found that way.\" </p> <p>Big Jim laughed in a hollow manner. \"So I phone my friend every day just to announce I'm still kicking the can and still hunting the macaroon. Still breathing, see? The day she doesn't get that call is the day she makes enquiries.\" </p> <p>Here at his private members' club, Big Jim could pass for a venerable commentator for a heavyweight daily newspaper, but he isn't. He works for an underground journal called the Spotlight. Mainstream journalists keep away from him. This is, Jim said, because certain high-ranking members of the overground media, even some members of his own club, are in league with the secret rulers of the world. And it is they who would make his death look like a typical Washington mugging. </p> <p>When I began hearing about the Bilderberg Group - about the notion that a tiny band of insidious and clandestine powermongers meet in a secret room from which they rule the world - I was sceptical. But I kept hearing about them, and I finally decided to try to settle the matter once and for all. Which is why I visited Big Jim Tucker. Within anti-Bilderberg circles, Big Jim is considered a pioneer, a trailblazer, risking his life to attempt to locate the geographical whereabouts of the secret room. </p> <p>\"They exist all right,\" said Big Jim, \"and they're not playing pinochle in there.\" Big Jim Tucker has spent 30 years documenting the facts. He's been after them since the 70s when he first got the hunch that they existed. He abandoned a good career in sports journalism on a big city paper. It has been cat and mouse ever since, he said. Good against evil. </p> <p>\"Those sick luminaries are always on the move,\" said Jim. \"They never come together in the same place twice, so as to evade detection. They only meet once a year, for a long weekend in May or June.\" </p> <p>They have been ruling the world in secret since 1954, Jim said, when a man called Joseph Retinger, whose name rarely appears in the history books, decided to create them. One of many mysteries is how Retinger - a Polish immigrant employed as secretary to the novelist Joseph Conrad - had the wherewithal and the contacts to organise such a mighty endeavour. Their first meeting took place in the Bilderberg Hotel, Holland, which is why the secret rulers of the world go by the name of the Bilderberg Group. Big Jim said that I happened to have caught him at a very good time. He was ready to take things further, to turn up the heat and cause some trouble. </p> <p>\"So you've actually managed to obtain the address of the next Bilderberg meeting?\" I asked Jim. </p> <p>\"Yes, sir,\" he said. </p> <p>\"You know exactly where it is?\" I asked. </p> <p>\"Yes, I do,\" he said. </p> <p>Big Jim said he fully intended to thwart their security and barge in unannounced to catch them red-handed going about their covert wickedness. I was welcome to tag along, he said, \"Just so long as you don't step on twigs or fall off walls while we're on the prowl. </p> <p>\"The plan is this,\" said Jim. \"We'll leave Washington on the last day of May, and we'll arrive at the target destination on the Sunday morning. We'll start patrolling that same afternoon. Patrol Sunday and Monday. Develop sources. Waiters, chambermaids . . .\" </p> <p>\"So they still meet in hotels?\" I said. </p> <p>\"Yes, sir,\" said Jim. \"The chambermaids will be gun-shy at first. They'll know something big and spooky is going on, but they won't know what. But then they'll begin to realise that whatever's happening at their hotel is evil. And that's when they'll open up.\" </p> <p>\"So what else will we do on the Sunday and Monday?\" </p> <p>\"Scout around the resort. Figure out ways to penetrate.\" </p> <p>\"Scout around looking for what?\" </p> <p>\"Where the short wall is,\" said Jim. \"Where the big drainpipe is.\" </p> <p>\"So we'll actually be climbing up drainpipes?\" I asked. </p> <p>\"Climbing up drainpipes,\" said Jim, \"trying not to sneeze or cough or step on twigs. Trying to avoid the guard dogs.\" </p> <p>\"What's the name of the hotel?\" </p> <p>\"I've - uh - got it written down here somewhere,\" said Jim. He riffled through his pockets. \"Here it is. The Caesar Park golfing resort, Sintra, Portugal.\" </p> <p>I looked quizzically at Jim. \"Are you sure about all of this?\" </p> <p>\"They are evil and their evil occurs in the dark shadows,\" replied Jim, emphatically. \"Behind closed doors. Ruling the world from a room. Imagine that. Let's get a drink.\" </p> <p>Jim took me to the Men's Bar upstairs. We drank beers and watched sport on the TV above the bar. Framed front pages of big news stories of days gone by lined the walls. \"War in the Persian Gulf!\" \"Thatcher Resigns!\" Jim said that both acts were orchestrated by Bilderberg. \"Margaret Thatcher is one of the good guys,\" said Jim. \"Bilderberg ordered her to dismantle British sovereignty, but she said no way, so they had her sacked.\" </p> <p>Big Jim said he once found himself at a drinks party with Thatcher and he took the opportunity to sidle up to her. \"How does it feel to have been denounced by those Bilderberg boys, ma'am?\" he growled. She whispered back that she considered it a \"great tribute to be denounced by Bilderberg\". </p> <p>I considered the significance of the endeavour we were about to undertake. For the other people I had met, Bilderberg was an inviolable almighty. Big Jim was the first man to have the tenacity to discover the address, and to plan on going in, and damn the consequences. This might change everything. Jim wouldn't tell me how he discovered the room's whereabouts, but a few moments later, as we sat at the bar, a tall man with a moustache bounded over and cheerfully introduced himself to me as Jim's mole from inside Bilderberg. </p> <p>\"I'm an accountant,\" he explained. \"Some very big clients use our firm. One guy happened to mention to me that he was on his way to somewhere near Lisbon in June for a very private meeting.\" </p> <p>Jim appeared a little annoyed by his mole's instantaneous candour, but then he shrugged and joined in with the story. \"We know,\" said Jim, \"that the Bilderberg Group always meet in May or June.\" </p> <p>\"So Jim,\" said the mole, \"started telephoning every five-star hotel near Lisbon.\" </p> <p>\"They always meet at a five-star hotel with golfing facilities,\" explained Jim. </p> <p>\"Always golfing facilities?\" I asked. </p> <p>Jim picked up on my subtext at once. \"Believe me,\" he said, \"they're not there to play golf. They're too busy starting wars.\" </p> <p>\"They may play golf when they're there,\" clarified the mole, \"but they're not there to play golf.\" </p> <p>\"Okay,\" I said. </p> <p>\"So,\" said Jim, \"I finally got around to calling a hotel up in the hills, and I said to the receptionist, 'I've been invited to the Bilderberg conference in June, but I'm afraid I've been very silly and lost my invitation. Could you confirm that this is the correct venue?' And she said, 'Why, of course, sir. Oh yes, sir. This is exactly where you're supposed to be, and we're very much looking forward to serving you.' \" </p> <p>Jim and his mole laughed. A nearby barfly heard their laughter and came over to join us. Jim and his mole stopped laughing. They turned their backs on the new guy and myself. There was a moment's awkwardness. </p> <p>\"So what's all this about?\" asked the new guy. </p> <p>\"Well,\" I whispered, \"that big old man in the trilby has tracked down the tiny group of people who rule the world in secret. Anyway, the two of us are going to Portugal next week to confront them.\" </p> <p>\"Oh, right,\" he said, unimpressed. \"What do they do, these secret rulers of the world?\" </p> <p>I shrugged. \"Everything, I guess,\" I said. \"They're called the Bilderberg Group.\" </p> <p>\"Can't say I've heard of them,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Jim's dedicated his life to exposing them,\" I said. </p> <p>\"It's not so surprising that I've never heard of them,\" said the new guy. He scanned the room. Every bar stool was occupied. Retired newsmen in suits stared into their beer glasses. The Men's Bar seemed to be where the Washington press corps went when there were no more deadlines, no stories left to file. \"It's not so surprising,\" he said. \"Pretty much everyone here has dedicated his life to something or other that nobody's ever heard of.\" </p> <p>The next morning, Jim took me to the office of the Spotlight, just around the corner from Capitol Hill. It is pristine from the outside, gleaming white, on a lovely tree-lined street. But it is dark and dusty inside, and there are boxes everywhere. He introduced me to Andy, his editor. We sat in the courtyard and drank iced tea. \"Jon,\" said Jim to Andy, \"thinks those Bilderberg boys are just playing pinochle in there.\" </p> <p>\"Well, first off,\" said Andy, impatiently, \"you get a lot of people, including newspaper editors, who say there is no Bilderberg Group, that it doesn't even exist.\" </p> <p>\"They've kept the vow of silence like they're going to nun school,\" said Jim. </p> <p>\"This is after you've had Prince Charles attend,\" said Andy. \"This is after you've had Bill Clinton attend. And still people say it doesn't exist. Not that it's just a social meeting, but that it doesn't exist.\" </p> <p>\"If they're just going to play golf and swap lies and chase girls,\" said Jim, \"why the armed guards? Know what I'm saying?\" </p> <p>\"They exist all right,\" said Andy. </p> <p>\"Prince Charles and Bill Clinton,\" explained Jim, \"are small-fry. The rulers of the world are the ones who do the inviting. The steering committee. Clinton was just a small-fry from somewhere called Arkansas when he got his invitation back in '91. Yeah, they had big plans for that boy.\" </p> <p>\"You be careful,\" said Andy. \"You're dealing with dangerous forces.\" </p> <p>***</p> <p>\"Mother,\" said Big Jim Tucker, \"your dutiful son is playing hunt the macaroon at the Paris Hotel, Portugal, Monday morning, 10.30am, thank you.\" </p> <p>It was a week later, and our first working day in Portugal. Our plan was to scout the target five-star golfing resort situated six miles north, develop sources and look for the short wall and the big drainpipe in preparation for the midnight penetration later in the week. Jim lay back on his bed. Our hotel was built on a busy roundabout. The ocean glistened in the distance, beyond a railway track and a couple of main roads. Even up here on the sixth floor you could hear the never-ending roar of the traffic. </p> <p>\"Unlike the Bilderberg luminaries,\" said Jim, ruefully, scanning the dirty walls of this bad hotel, \"some of us are working on a tight budget.\" Jim lit a Camel. He is a large, elderly man, and I am not athletic. Our agility levels were impeded by our smoking habits, and we wheezed in the Portuguese heat. I was unsure as to how successful the two of us would be in climbing up drainpipes. I pictured slapstick scenarios that would be hilarious to onlookers but not to us. </p> <p>Jim was acting breezily, but I could sense his nervousness. \"I'm a quarterback,\" he said, \"gearing up for the Superbowl.\" </p> <p>By Jim's reckoning, the Bilderberg Group was not scheduled to arrive in Portugal until Wednesday night. He said he had heard reports that their private security guards had already set up camp at the Caesar Park and were planning to operate a shoot-to-kill policy for all penetrators. This somewhat diminished the potential for slapstick hilarity. I was not feeling cocksure. </p> <p>We had that morning fruitlessly scanned the news-stands for references to the meeting. \"Surprise, surprise,\" growled Jim. \"Media black-out.\" </p> <p>There was, however, one notable exception. The Weekly News, a tiny English-language parish newspaper, circulation 8,000, for Algarve tourist workers and regular English visitors such as Sir Cliff Richard, had gone big on the story. Very big: \"As speculation on the internet runs rife, the News checks it out and it does seem that . . . secret world government group is meeting here!\" </p> <p>The Weekly News made me feel less vulnerable down here on the ground. Jim said he wanted to touch base with its editorial team later in the week. \"If the Weekly News boys can help us expose those Bilderberg jackasses,\" he said, \"I'm all for pooling information.\" </p> <p>I had rented a car from Budget. We drove into the mountains, away from the boisterous, good-time package-tour Estoril, towards the more serene and ancient pastures of Sintra, seven miles up the road. On the way, we discussed cover stories in case we incurred suspicion. We elected to be holidaymakers, getting a drink at the poolside bar because we'd heard so many good things about the resort, which was undoubtedly the finest around. </p> <p>The Caesar Park is situated three miles from the main Estoril-Sintra road - two and a half miles down a narrow country lane, through the wilderness of a national park, followed by another half-mile private driveway. It became evident, as we approached the big peach gates that led into the resort, that the midnight penetration would be an even more formidable task than we had anticipated. The hotel is surrounded on all sides by dense undergrowth and sheer mountains. Jim silently pondered these obstacles from the passenger seat. He photographed the mountains. We drove through the gates (the gatekeeper let us in with a wave) and down the half-mile-long driveway. And then the hotel appeared - a peach-coloured resort of purpose-built luxury. </p> <p>\"The civilians haven't been shifted out yet,\" muttered Jim, as we left the car and wandered towards the colossal marble reception area. Jim whipped out his camera and photographed the tourists. These photographs would later appear in the Spotlight as \"unaware civilians\". </p> <p>We were not inconspicuous, Jim and I, strolling around the Caesar Park in our open-necked shirts. We were, in fact, an unlikely holidaymaking duo. At a very big push, Jim could resemble a benevolent, wealthy, southern sugar daddy and I his gawky, early-30s toy-boy. But I doubted the persuasiveness of the scenario. \"I don't think,\" I murmured, as we wandered out to the swimming pool, \"that the holidaymaking cover is a convincing one. I think we should think of something else.\" </p> <p>\"We're salesmen,\" said Jim. \"We're just salesmen getting lunch.\" </p> <p>\"What do we sell?\" I asked. </p> <p>\"We don't like to talk business when we're having lunch,\" said Jim. </p> <p>We sat on stools at the poolside bar. Unaware young women sunbathed in bikinis. </p> <p>\"Ma'am,\" said Jim to a young passing waitress, bowing slightly, his newshound trilby now replaced by a tourist's straw sunhat, \"I'm a little confused. I tried to book a room here for Thursday, and they told me that the whole hotel had been closed down for some big meeting. Must be a pretty damned big important meeting if you ask me . . .\" </p> <p>The waitress shrugged. \"I don't know,\" she said. She smiled slightly and left us. </p> <p>Jim got out his notepad. He wrote notes and then he read them out to me: </p> <p> <strong> Dateline Portugal</strong> </p> <p>Tension filled the air inside the posh Caesar Park resort on Monday. At the poolside bar, the pretty barmaid's face filled with tension when asked to speculate on the big important meeting taking place from Thursday. She shrugged her shoulders and feigned ignorance, but the tension on her face spoke volumes. </p> <p> Jim put down his notepad. \"Is that accurate?\" he said. </p> <p>\"I don't know,\" I said.\"We may be imbuing her with our own feelings of tension.\" </p> <p>\"Still,\" said Jim, finishing his iced tea, \"now we know what the drinks of the rich taste like.\" </p> <p>We paid and patrolled the resort some more. I was disappointed with the Caesar Park, its Eurotrashy aircraft-hangar spaces, its cold approximation of luxury. The lobby shops have names such as \"Fashionable\". I would have assumed that Bilderberg would meet somewhere classier. Jim explained that I still hadn't quite got it. They are not there for classy holidaying. They are there to start wars. Also, Jim added, there is a finite number of international hotels that can transform themselves into walled fortresses, that have their own helicopter pads and nearby military air bases. </p> <p>Jim and I split up. I looked at the prints on the wall outside the upstairs bar. A half-hour passed. I wandered aimlessly through the lobbies and the bars. There were other aimless wanderers, too: a woman in a red dress and a man in his 30s wearing a tweed jacket. It struck me that we all seemed to be wandering aimlessly in some kind of unison, but it didn't cross my mind - right up until the moment that the man in the tweed jacket marched across the room and began questioning me in an angry whisper - that I was being tailed. </p> <p>\"We've watched you for an hour. I'm the hotel manager. You take pictures. You ask questions about some big important meeting. Who are you?\" </p> <p>\"I . . .\" I paused. Then I clumsily announced, \"I'm from England.\" It was the only thing I could think of. This works, of course, in other circumstances abroad. But it didn't work here. </p> <p>\"What do you want?\" </p> <p>I stared blankly at him. </p> <p>\"What is your business here?\" </p> <p>I continued to stare blankly. And then another man appeared. This new man was older, with a tan, and he spoke with a smooth European accent. \"It's okay!\" he laughed. \"Everything's fine! There's no problem!\" He gave the hotel manager's shoulder a little squeeze. \"I am your servant,\" he said to me. \"If there's anything you'd like, please be my guest. Think of this hotel as your home. If I can be of any service to you, any service whatsoever, don't hesitate to ask.\" </p> <p>I glanced over with anxiety at the hotel manager, who was now standing a little way off; overruled, slighted and silent. \"I mean,\" he smiled, \"what could you possibly be doing here that could cause any harm to anybody?\" </p> <p>\"Are you . . .\" I paused. There was something indistinctly alarming about the things he was saying to me. I could not imagine that he really did want me to think of this hotel as my home. So why did he say that? I presume, in retrospect, that the message he was sending to me was: \"We have noticed you, you are not welcome, but we are allowing you to leave without incident, just so long as you don't come back.\" At the time, however, the message I picked up was: \"I am extremely sinister and powerful. This is so evident that I can afford to feign generous subservience.\" </p> <p>\"Are you with the Caesar Park?\" I asked the charming man. </p> <p>\"Oh, no,\" he laughed. \"No, I am not with the hotel. So, as I say, think of this hotel as your home. Really, everything's fine and there's no problem. What problems could there be?\" </p> <p>What problems could there be? I wanted the young hotel manager to intervene. I suddenly felt that he could be my ally in this situation. But he remained impassive. </p> <p>\"Don't feel as if you have to go,\" said the charming man, his arms outstretched. \"Stay as long as you like. Enjoy the facilities. Have a swim!\" </p> <p>\"So if you're not with the hotel,\" I said, \"who are you with?\" </p> <p>\"I am with . . .\" he paused \". . . another organisation.\" </p> <p>\"Which is called . . .?\" </p> <p>He laughed and looked at the ground. \"Enjoy your afternoon,\" he said. </p> <p>I waited for Jim down in the lobby, right by the revolving doors that led outside to the car park. The hotel manager stood nearby, watching me with a constant, even gaze. After five minutes, Jim ambled towards us. When he noticed the hotel manager, he slowed his gait to the laziest of strolls - a little gesture of southern gentlemanly defiance. </p> <p>There was something new in the car park now, a dozen police motorcycles lined up by the revolving doors. \"The big shut-down is beginning,\" whispered Jim. He pulled out his camera and photographed the police. \"We're lucky,\" he said. \"An hour later, we wouldn't have gotten near the place.\" </p> <p>\"What did that man say to you?\" I asked. </p> <p>\"Oh,\" said Jim, \"he would just love to be of service and provide any help I needed, blah blah blah.\" </p> <p>\"How can you say blah blah blah?\" I said. \"That wasn't blah blah blah. That was actually fucking sinister.\" </p> <p>\"Those Bilderberg boys can be pretty sinister,\" said Jim. We climbed into our car. I started the engine. </p> <p>\"So I told him that I didn't need any help wandering around the hotel, thank you all the same,\" said Jim. \"Then he asked where we were staying . . .\" </p> <p>\"Did he?\" </p> <p>\"And I said, 'Oh, just some flea-pit down the road.'\" </p> <p>***</p> <p>That evening, when I went for dinner, I put a sliver of paper in the crack between my hotel room door and the frame, as I had seen James Coburn do in Our Man Flint. Actually, Coburn put a single hair in his door. But my door crack was too large for single hairs, and they kept falling on to the floor and disappearing into the carpet. I was standing there in the corridor tugging my hair out. So I switched to a sliver of paper. When I returned from dinner, the sliver was still there. There was always a possibility, of course, that they'd taken a look around and put the sliver back where they'd found it. I slept fitfully that night, but nothing happened. </p> <p>\"Mother.\" It was Tuesday morning. Jim was leaving his regular answerphone message with his friend back in Washington DC to confirm he had not been murdered during the previous 24 hours. \"Your dutiful son is playing kick the can in Portugal. Thank you very much.\" This was supposed to be an easy day. Jim simply wanted to verify that the complete shut-down of the Caesar Park had been accomplished. We would drive up there and be turned away at the gate. Jim would ask why, for the record, and document the response in his notepad. Then we would turn around and drive back to our hotel for a leisurely afternoon by the pool and in the bar. </p> <p>But this was not to be. We arrived at the Caesar Park to discover no police, no cordon, no shut-down. The gatekeeper lifted the barrier and waved us on with a cheerful smile. For the first time, Jim appeared sidestepped. \"That's surprising,\" he admitted. \"That's surprising already.\" </p> <p>\"Do we drive in?\" </p> <p>\"I'm confounded,\" murmured Jim. \"We saw the shut-down begin yesterday. We saw it with our own eyes. And now no shut-down. This is not what's supposed to happen.\" </p> <p>The gatekeeper approached the car. \"Just drive in,\" said Jim urgently. Impulsively, I took my foot off the brake and we cruised up the drive. This was a disconcerting new twist. We were venturing into a place where it had been made perfectly clear that we were not welcome, and we didn't even want to be there. We were accidental agents provocateurs, simply because we had been waved on at the gate. </p> <p>\"The hotel is deserted,\" I said, as we pulled into the car park. \"We're the only people here.\" </p> <p>\"Let's get lunch,\" said Jim. \"Just two guys getting lunch.\" </p> <p>We wandered through the now-deserted marble lobby. There were no more civilians. We walked out into the silent grounds and sat at the poolside bar, the only two customers in a hotel designed for thousands. A young waitress appeared. </p> <p>\"Ma'am,\" said Jim, raising his trilby. </p> <p>\"Sir?\" she said. </p> <p>\"What time do you get off work?\" </p> <p>The question seemed to startle her. </p> <p>\"Nine o'clock,\" she said, cautiously. </p> <p>\"And what bars do you like drinking in?\" said Jim. </p> <p>\"There are some nice bars in the village near the cathedral.\" </p> <p>\"Any bars in particular?\" Jim laughed. \"Don't worry. I'm buying.\" </p> <p>\"Just lots of nice bars in the village,\" she said, evenly. </p> <p>\"That's good information,\" said Jim. \"Thank you, ma'am,\" he called after her. </p> <p>He turned to me. \"Now we know where the waiting staff drink. Could be good contacts.\" </p> <p>\"So,\" I said, \"shall we try the bars near the cathedral?\" </p> <p>\"Sure,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Will we go, then?\" </p> <p>\"Okay,\" said Jim. </p> <p>We walked back to the car and began driving the half-mile towards the exit. I glanced into my rear-view mirror. A dark green Lancia had pulled out behind us. </p> <p>\"Jim,\" I said. </p> <p>\"Mmm?\" </p> <p>\"I think we're being followed.\" </p> <p>Jim turned around. \"No shit,\" he grinned. \"Don't worry. Once we're on the public highway, they'd be pretty foolish to try anything.\" </p> <p>\"Okay,\" I said. </p> <p>\"They're not going to want to have a fat old dead reporter on the side of the road,\" said Jim. \"That's too big a news story.\" </p> <p>\"Okay,\" I said. </p> <p>\"But here they could say, 'Oh, we thought they were armed. They looked threatening. We told them to stop but they didn't stop.' Bango!\" </p> <p>\"I get the picture,\" I said. </p> <p>A flock of geese wandered idly up the drive in front of me. I honked my horn. We finally reached the peach gates. </p> <p>\"You watch,\" said Jim. \"He'll turn around now. He's done his job. Poor fool.\" </p> <p>But the Lancia didn't turn around. It began to follow us down the deserted lane. </p> <p>\"Uh oh,\" said Jim. </p> <p>***</p> <p> \"British Embassy.\"</p> <p>\"Okay,\" I said, \"I'm a journalist from London. I'm calling you on the road from Sintra to Estoril . . .\"</p> <p>\"Hold on.\"</p> <p>\"Press office.\"</p> <p>\"I'm a journalist from London,\" I said. \"I'm calling you on the road from Sintra to Estoril. I'm being tailed, right now, by a dark green Lancia belonging to the Bilderberg Group.\"</p> <p>There was a sharp intake of breath. \"Go on,\" she said.</p> <p>\"I'm sorry,\" I said, \"but I just heard you take a sharp breath.\"</p> <p>\"Bilderberg?\" she said.</p> <p>\"Yes,\" I said. \"They watched us scouting around the Caesar Park Hotel and they've been following us ever since. We have now been followed for three hours. I wasn't sure at first, so I stopped my car on the side of a deserted lane and he stopped his car right in front of us. Can you imagine just how chilling that moment was? This is especially disconcerting because I'm from England and I'm not used to being spied on.\"</p> <p>\"Do you have Bilderberg's permission to be in Portugal?\" she said. \"Do they know you are here?\"</p> <p>\"No,\" I said.</p> <p>\"Bilderberg are very secretive,\" she said. \"They don't want people looking into their business. What are you doing here?\"</p> <p>\"I am essentially a humorous journalist,\" I explained. \"I am a humorous journalist out of my depth. Do you think it might help if we tell them that?\"</p> <p>From the corner of my eye, I saw Jim wind down his window. He leant his head out and blew an antagonising lady-like kiss at the Lancia.</p> <p>\"Hold on a second,\" I said. \"Jim!\" I said, sternly. \"Please stop that.\" I lowered my voice. \"I'm here with an American,\" I said, \"called Big Jim Tucker. He's an agent provocateur. That might be the problem. Perhaps you can phone Bilderberg and explain that I may be in the car with Jim Tucker, but I'm not actually with him.\"</p> <p>\"Listen\"' she said, urgently, \"Bilderberg is much bigger than we are. We're very small. We're just a little embassy. Do you understand? They're way out of our league. All I can say is go back to your hotel and sit tight.\"</p> <p>\"I'm actually just pulling into our hotel car park right now. The Paris Hotel in Estoril. He's right behind me. He's pulling up on the street right next to the hotel. He's getting out of his car . . .\" \"Sit tight,\" she said. \"I'll make some phone calls. Whatever happens, don't incite them in any way. Don't fan the flames.\"</p> <p>Before the chase had begun, Jim was lumbering and supine. Now he jumped out of the car with the agility of a young deer. The man from the Lancia climbed out of his car and took up a position behind a tree. He was young, in his 30s, with short black hair. He wore sunglasses and a dark green suit.</p> <p>\"I can see you!\" sang Jim. \"You're behind the tree. Peek-a-boo! Smile pretty for my idiot-proof camera.\"</p> <p>\"Jim,\" I said, \"will you stop that.\"</p> <p>But everything was beyond my control. It was as if the invigoration of the chase had transformed Jim into a sprightly teenager. </p> <p>A one-sided game of peek-a-boo ensued, during which the chaser maintained a steely expression behind his sunglasses, Jim performed a little ballet dance, and I sidled towards the swimming-pool area, attempting to distance myself from the unfolding crisis. Jim wandered over to me.</p> <p>\"Am I being paranoid,\" he said, \"or did Bilderberg set a trap for us? No, listen. Yesterday, we saw the shut-down begin. We saw it with our own eyes. Today, surprise surprise, no shut-down. They let us in with a smile . . .\" Jim trailed off.</p> <p><a href=\"http://books.theguardian.com/extracts/story/0,6761,449307,00.html\">Continued</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "At the National Press Club on Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington DC, Big Jim Tucker left a coded message on the answer-machine of a friend. \"Mother. Your dutiful son is playing kick the can on Pennsylvania Avenue, Tuesday morning, 10.30am, thank you.\" Big Jim replaced the telephone receiver. He lit a cigarette and glanced around the lobby with a routine vigilance. Even here at his club, his gentleman's club, he considered himself not entirely safe. Anyone could discover that this was where he had breakfast every day: three strong black coffees and some pastries on the side. \"If they ever got me,\" he said, \"they'd make it look like a typical Washington mugging. A mugging on the sidewalk. Killed for a couple of dollars. Another three paragraphs in the newspaper.\" Jim paused. He pulled on his cigarette. His heart is not strong due to his habit of smoking unfiltered Camels at all times, pack after pack. He is quite huge, an elderly southern gentleman in a crumpled suit and a newshound trilby. He has a voice like gravel (a result of cigarette-induced emphysema, which, by a happy accident, gives his speech an enigmatic rhythm, like a charismatic Sam Spade down on his luck) and an office downtown with Venetian blinds. He said, \"The thing is, we don't know how much time we've got left. And suppose I just so happen to 'drop dead' in my office on Tuesday afternoon. It could be the following Monday before someone says, 'Where is that boy?' I don't want to be burnt bacon when they find me. I guess I'm just too vain to be found that way.\" Big Jim laughed in a hollow manner. \"So I phone my friend every day just to announce I'm still kicking the can and still hunting the macaroon. Still breathing, see? The day she doesn't get that call is the day she makes enquiries.\" Here at his private members' club, Big Jim could pass for a venerable commentator for a heavyweight daily newspaper, but he isn't. He works for an underground journal called the Spotlight. Mainstream journalists keep away from him. This is, Jim said, because certain high-ranking members of the overground media, even some members of his own club, are in league with the secret rulers of the world. And it is they who would make his death look like a typical Washington mugging. When I began hearing about the Bilderberg Group - about the notion that a tiny band of insidious and clandestine powermongers meet in a secret room from which they rule the world - I was sceptical. But I kept hearing about them, and I finally decided to try to settle the matter once and for all. Which is why I visited Big Jim Tucker. Within anti-Bilderberg circles, Big Jim is considered a pioneer, a trailblazer, risking his life to attempt to locate the geographical whereabouts of the secret room. \"They exist all right,\" said Big Jim, \"and they're not playing pinochle in there.\" Big Jim Tucker has spent 30 years documenting the facts. He's been after them since the 70s when he first got the hunch that they existed. He abandoned a good career in sports journalism on a big city paper. It has been cat and mouse ever since, he said. Good against evil. \"Those sick luminaries are always on the move,\" said Jim. \"They never come together in the same place twice, so as to evade detection. They only meet once a year, for a long weekend in May or June.\" They have been ruling the world in secret since 1954, Jim said, when a man called Joseph Retinger, whose name rarely appears in the history books, decided to create them. One of many mysteries is how Retinger - a Polish immigrant employed as secretary to the novelist Joseph Conrad - had the wherewithal and the contacts to organise such a mighty endeavour. Their first meeting took place in the Bilderberg Hotel, Holland, which is why the secret rulers of the world go by the name of the Bilderberg Group. Big Jim said that I happened to have caught him at a very good time. He was ready to take things further, to turn up the heat and cause some trouble. \"So you've actually managed to obtain the address of the next Bilderberg meeting?\" I asked Jim. \"Yes, sir,\" he said. \"You know exactly where it is?\" I asked. \"Yes, I do,\" he said. Big Jim said he fully intended to thwart their security and barge in unannounced to catch them red-handed going about their covert wickedness. I was welcome to tag along, he said, \"Just so long as you don't step on twigs or fall off walls while we're on the prowl. \"The plan is this,\" said Jim. \"We'll leave Washington on the last day of May, and we'll arrive at the target destination on the Sunday morning. We'll start patrolling that same afternoon. Patrol Sunday and Monday. Develop sources. Waiters, chambermaids . . .\" \"So they still meet in hotels?\" I said. \"Yes, sir,\" said Jim. \"The chambermaids will be gun-shy at first. They'll know something big and spooky is going on, but they won't know what. But then they'll begin to realise that whatever's happening at their hotel is evil. And that's when they'll open up.\" \"So what else will we do on the Sunday and Monday?\" \"Scout around the resort. Figure out ways to penetrate.\" \"Scout around looking for what?\" \"Where the short wall is,\" said Jim. \"Where the big drainpipe is.\" \"So we'll actually be climbing up drainpipes?\" I asked. \"Climbing up drainpipes,\" said Jim, \"trying not to sneeze or cough or step on twigs. Trying to avoid the guard dogs.\" \"What's the name of the hotel?\" \"I've - uh - got it written down here somewhere,\" said Jim. He riffled through his pockets. \"Here it is. The Caesar Park golfing resort, Sintra, Portugal.\" I looked quizzically at Jim. \"Are you sure about all of this?\" \"They are evil and their evil occurs in the dark shadows,\" replied Jim, emphatically. \"Behind closed doors. Ruling the world from a room. Imagine that. Let's get a drink.\" Jim took me to the Men's Bar upstairs. We drank beers and watched sport on the TV above the bar. Framed front pages of big news stories of days gone by lined the walls. \"War in the Persian Gulf!\" \"Thatcher Resigns!\" Jim said that both acts were orchestrated by Bilderberg. \"Margaret Thatcher is one of the good guys,\" said Jim. \"Bilderberg ordered her to dismantle British sovereignty, but she said no way, so they had her sacked.\" Big Jim said he once found himself at a drinks party with Thatcher and he took the opportunity to sidle up to her. \"How does it feel to have been denounced by those Bilderberg boys, ma'am?\" he growled. She whispered back that she considered it a \"great tribute to be denounced by Bilderberg\". I considered the significance of the endeavour we were about to undertake. For the other people I had met, Bilderberg was an inviolable almighty. Big Jim was the first man to have the tenacity to discover the address, and to plan on going in, and damn the consequences. This might change everything. Jim wouldn't tell me how he discovered the room's whereabouts, but a few moments later, as we sat at the bar, a tall man with a moustache bounded over and cheerfully introduced himself to me as Jim's mole from inside Bilderberg. \"I'm an accountant,\" he explained. \"Some very big clients use our firm. One guy happened to mention to me that he was on his way to somewhere near Lisbon in June for a very private meeting.\" Jim appeared a little annoyed by his mole's instantaneous candour, but then he shrugged and joined in with the story. \"We know,\" said Jim, \"that the Bilderberg Group always meet in May or June.\" \"So Jim,\" said the mole, \"started telephoning every five-star hotel near Lisbon.\" \"They always meet at a five-star hotel with golfing facilities,\" explained Jim. \"Always golfing facilities?\" I asked. Jim picked up on my subtext at once. \"Believe me,\" he said, \"they're not there to play golf. They're too busy starting wars.\" \"They may play golf when they're there,\" clarified the mole, \"but they're not there to play golf.\" \"Okay,\" I said. \"So,\" said Jim, \"I finally got around to calling a hotel up in the hills, and I said to the receptionist, 'I've been invited to the Bilderberg conference in June, but I'm afraid I've been very silly and lost my invitation. Could you confirm that this is the correct venue?' And she said, 'Why, of course, sir. Oh yes, sir. This is exactly where you're supposed to be, and we're very much looking forward to serving you.' \" Jim and his mole laughed. A nearby barfly heard their laughter and came over to join us. Jim and his mole stopped laughing. They turned their backs on the new guy and myself. There was a moment's awkwardness. \"So what's all this about?\" asked the new guy. \"Well,\" I whispered, \"that big old man in the trilby has tracked down the tiny group of people who rule the world in secret. Anyway, the two of us are going to Portugal next week to confront them.\" \"Oh, right,\" he said, unimpressed. \"What do they do, these secret rulers of the world?\" I shrugged. \"Everything, I guess,\" I said. \"They're called the Bilderberg Group.\" \"Can't say I've heard of them,\" he said. \"Jim's dedicated his life to exposing them,\" I said. \"It's not so surprising that I've never heard of them,\" said the new guy. He scanned the room. Every bar stool was occupied. Retired newsmen in suits stared into their beer glasses. The Men's Bar seemed to be where the Washington press corps went when there were no more deadlines, no stories left to file. \"It's not so surprising,\" he said. \"Pretty much everyone here has dedicated his life to something or other that nobody's ever heard of.\" The next morning, Jim took me to the office of the Spotlight, just around the corner from Capitol Hill. It is pristine from the outside, gleaming white, on a lovely tree-lined street. But it is dark and dusty inside, and there are boxes everywhere. He introduced me to Andy, his editor. We sat in the courtyard and drank iced tea. \"Jon,\" said Jim to Andy, \"thinks those Bilderberg boys are just playing pinochle in there.\" \"Well, first off,\" said Andy, impatiently, \"you get a lot of people, including newspaper editors, who say there is no Bilderberg Group, that it doesn't even exist.\" \"They've kept the vow of silence like they're going to nun school,\" said Jim. \"This is after you've had Prince Charles attend,\" said Andy. \"This is after you've had Bill Clinton attend. And still people say it doesn't exist. Not that it's just a social meeting, but that it doesn't exist.\" \"If they're just going to play golf and swap lies and chase girls,\" said Jim, \"why the armed guards? Know what I'm saying?\" \"They exist all right,\" said Andy. \"Prince Charles and Bill Clinton,\" explained Jim, \"are small-fry. The rulers of the world are the ones who do the inviting. The steering committee. Clinton was just a small-fry from somewhere called Arkansas when he got his invitation back in '91. Yeah, they had big plans for that boy.\" \"You be careful,\" said Andy. \"You're dealing with dangerous forces.\" *** \"Mother,\" said Big Jim Tucker, \"your dutiful son is playing hunt the macaroon at the Paris Hotel, Portugal, Monday morning, 10.30am, thank you.\" It was a week later, and our first working day in Portugal. Our plan was to scout the target five-star golfing resort situated six miles north, develop sources and look for the short wall and the big drainpipe in preparation for the midnight penetration later in the week. Jim lay back on his bed. Our hotel was built on a busy roundabout. The ocean glistened in the distance, beyond a railway track and a couple of main roads. Even up here on the sixth floor you could hear the never-ending roar of the traffic. \"Unlike the Bilderberg luminaries,\" said Jim, ruefully, scanning the dirty walls of this bad hotel, \"some of us are working on a tight budget.\" Jim lit a Camel. He is a large, elderly man, and I am not athletic. Our agility levels were impeded by our smoking habits, and we wheezed in the Portuguese heat. I was unsure as to how successful the two of us would be in climbing up drainpipes. I pictured slapstick scenarios that would be hilarious to onlookers but not to us. Jim was acting breezily, but I could sense his nervousness. \"I'm a quarterback,\" he said, \"gearing up for the Superbowl.\" By Jim's reckoning, the Bilderberg Group was not scheduled to arrive in Portugal until Wednesday night. He said he had heard reports that their private security guards had already set up camp at the Caesar Park and were planning to operate a shoot-to-kill policy for all penetrators. This somewhat diminished the potential for slapstick hilarity. I was not feeling cocksure. We had that morning fruitlessly scanned the news-stands for references to the meeting. \"Surprise, surprise,\" growled Jim. \"Media black-out.\" There was, however, one notable exception. The Weekly News, a tiny English-language parish newspaper, circulation 8,000, for Algarve tourist workers and regular English visitors such as Sir Cliff Richard, had gone big on the story. Very big: \"As speculation on the internet runs rife, the News checks it out and it does seem that . . . secret world government group is meeting here!\" The Weekly News made me feel less vulnerable down here on the ground. Jim said he wanted to touch base with its editorial team later in the week. \"If the Weekly News boys can help us expose those Bilderberg jackasses,\" he said, \"I'm all for pooling information.\" I had rented a car from Budget. We drove into the mountains, away from the boisterous, good-time package-tour Estoril, towards the more serene and ancient pastures of Sintra, seven miles up the road. On the way, we discussed cover stories in case we incurred suspicion. We elected to be holidaymakers, getting a drink at the poolside bar because we'd heard so many good things about the resort, which was undoubtedly the finest around. The Caesar Park is situated three miles from the main Estoril-Sintra road - two and a half miles down a narrow country lane, through the wilderness of a national park, followed by another half-mile private driveway. It became evident, as we approached the big peach gates that led into the resort, that the midnight penetration would be an even more formidable task than we had anticipated. The hotel is surrounded on all sides by dense undergrowth and sheer mountains. Jim silently pondered these obstacles from the passenger seat. He photographed the mountains. We drove through the gates (the gatekeeper let us in with a wave) and down the half-mile-long driveway. And then the hotel appeared - a peach-coloured resort of purpose-built luxury. \"The civilians haven't been shifted out yet,\" muttered Jim, as we left the car and wandered towards the colossal marble reception area. Jim whipped out his camera and photographed the tourists. These photographs would later appear in the Spotlight as \"unaware civilians\". We were not inconspicuous, Jim and I, strolling around the Caesar Park in our open-necked shirts. We were, in fact, an unlikely holidaymaking duo. At a very big push, Jim could resemble a benevolent, wealthy, southern sugar daddy and I his gawky, early-30s toy-boy. But I doubted the persuasiveness of the scenario. \"I don't think,\" I murmured, as we wandered out to the swimming pool, \"that the holidaymaking cover is a convincing one. I think we should think of something else.\" \"We're salesmen,\" said Jim. \"We're just salesmen getting lunch.\" \"What do we sell?\" I asked. \"We don't like to talk business when we're having lunch,\" said Jim. We sat on stools at the poolside bar. Unaware young women sunbathed in bikinis. \"Ma'am,\" said Jim to a young passing waitress, bowing slightly, his newshound trilby now replaced by a tourist's straw sunhat, \"I'm a little confused. I tried to book a room here for Thursday, and they told me that the whole hotel had been closed down for some big meeting. Must be a pretty damned big important meeting if you ask me . . .\" The waitress shrugged. \"I don't know,\" she said. She smiled slightly and left us. Jim got out his notepad. He wrote notes and then he read them out to me: Dateline Portugal Tension filled the air inside the posh Caesar Park resort on Monday. At the poolside bar, the pretty barmaid's face filled with tension when asked to speculate on the big important meeting taking place from Thursday. She shrugged her shoulders and feigned ignorance, but the tension on her face spoke volumes. Jim put down his notepad. \"Is that accurate?\" he said. \"I don't know,\" I said.\"We may be imbuing her with our own feelings of tension.\" \"Still,\" said Jim, finishing his iced tea, \"now we know what the drinks of the rich taste like.\" We paid and patrolled the resort some more. I was disappointed with the Caesar Park, its Eurotrashy aircraft-hangar spaces, its cold approximation of luxury. The lobby shops have names such as \"Fashionable\". I would have assumed that Bilderberg would meet somewhere classier. Jim explained that I still hadn't quite got it. They are not there for classy holidaying. They are there to start wars. Also, Jim added, there is a finite number of international hotels that can transform themselves into walled fortresses, that have their own helicopter pads and nearby military air bases. Jim and I split up. I looked at the prints on the wall outside the upstairs bar. A half-hour passed. I wandered aimlessly through the lobbies and the bars. There were other aimless wanderers, too: a woman in a red dress and a man in his 30s wearing a tweed jacket. It struck me that we all seemed to be wandering aimlessly in some kind of unison, but it didn't cross my mind - right up until the moment that the man in the tweed jacket marched across the room and began questioning me in an angry whisper - that I was being tailed. \"We've watched you for an hour. I'm the hotel manager. You take pictures. You ask questions about some big important meeting. Who are you?\" \"I . . .\" I paused. Then I clumsily announced, \"I'm from England.\" It was the only thing I could think of. This works, of course, in other circumstances abroad. But it didn't work here. \"What do you want?\" I stared blankly at him. \"What is your business here?\" I continued to stare blankly. And then another man appeared. This new man was older, with a tan, and he spoke with a smooth European accent. \"It's okay!\" he laughed. \"Everything's fine! There's no problem!\" He gave the hotel manager's shoulder a little squeeze. \"I am your servant,\" he said to me. \"If there's anything you'd like, please be my guest. Think of this hotel as your home. If I can be of any service to you, any service whatsoever, don't hesitate to ask.\" I glanced over with anxiety at the hotel manager, who was now standing a little way off; overruled, slighted and silent. \"I mean,\" he smiled, \"what could you possibly be doing here that could cause any harm to anybody?\" \"Are you . . .\" I paused. There was something indistinctly alarming about the things he was saying to me. I could not imagine that he really did want me to think of this hotel as my home. So why did he say that? I presume, in retrospect, that the message he was sending to me was: \"We have noticed you, you are not welcome, but we are allowing you to leave without incident, just so long as you don't come back.\" At the time, however, the message I picked up was: \"I am extremely sinister and powerful. This is so evident that I can afford to feign generous subservience.\" \"Are you with the Caesar Park?\" I asked the charming man. \"Oh, no,\" he laughed. \"No, I am not with the hotel. So, as I say, think of this hotel as your home. Really, everything's fine and there's no problem. What problems could there be?\" What problems could there be? I wanted the young hotel manager to intervene. I suddenly felt that he could be my ally in this situation. But he remained impassive. \"Don't feel as if you have to go,\" said the charming man, his arms outstretched. \"Stay as long as you like. Enjoy the facilities. Have a swim!\" \"So if you're not with the hotel,\" I said, \"who are you with?\" \"I am with . . .\" he paused \". . . another organisation.\" \"Which is called . . .?\" He laughed and looked at the ground. \"Enjoy your afternoon,\" he said. I waited for Jim down in the lobby, right by the revolving doors that led outside to the car park. The hotel manager stood nearby, watching me with a constant, even gaze. After five minutes, Jim ambled towards us. When he noticed the hotel manager, he slowed his gait to the laziest of strolls - a little gesture of southern gentlemanly defiance. There was something new in the car park now, a dozen police motorcycles lined up by the revolving doors. \"The big shut-down is beginning,\" whispered Jim. He pulled out his camera and photographed the police. \"We're lucky,\" he said. \"An hour later, we wouldn't have gotten near the place.\" \"What did that man say to you?\" I asked. \"Oh,\" said Jim, \"he would just love to be of service and provide any help I needed, blah blah blah.\" \"How can you say blah blah blah?\" I said. \"That wasn't blah blah blah. That was actually fucking sinister.\" \"Those Bilderberg boys can be pretty sinister,\" said Jim. We climbed into our car. I started the engine. \"So I told him that I didn't need any help wandering around the hotel, thank you all the same,\" said Jim. \"Then he asked where we were staying . . .\" \"Did he?\" \"And I said, 'Oh, just some flea-pit down the road.'\" *** That evening, when I went for dinner, I put a sliver of paper in the crack between my hotel room door and the frame, as I had seen James Coburn do in Our Man Flint. Actually, Coburn put a single hair in his door. But my door crack was too large for single hairs, and they kept falling on to the floor and disappearing into the carpet. I was standing there in the corridor tugging my hair out. So I switched to a sliver of paper. When I returned from dinner, the sliver was still there. There was always a possibility, of course, that they'd taken a look around and put the sliver back where they'd found it. I slept fitfully that night, but nothing happened. \"Mother.\" It was Tuesday morning. Jim was leaving his regular answerphone message with his friend back in Washington DC to confirm he had not been murdered during the previous 24 hours. \"Your dutiful son is playing kick the can in Portugal. Thank you very much.\" This was supposed to be an easy day. Jim simply wanted to verify that the complete shut-down of the Caesar Park had been accomplished. We would drive up there and be turned away at the gate. Jim would ask why, for the record, and document the response in his notepad. Then we would turn around and drive back to our hotel for a leisurely afternoon by the pool and in the bar. But this was not to be. We arrived at the Caesar Park to discover no police, no cordon, no shut-down. The gatekeeper lifted the barrier and waved us on with a cheerful smile. For the first time, Jim appeared sidestepped. \"That's surprising,\" he admitted. \"That's surprising already.\" \"Do we drive in?\" \"I'm confounded,\" murmured Jim. \"We saw the shut-down begin yesterday. We saw it with our own eyes. And now no shut-down. This is not what's supposed to happen.\" The gatekeeper approached the car. \"Just drive in,\" said Jim urgently. Impulsively, I took my foot off the brake and we cruised up the drive. This was a disconcerting new twist. We were venturing into a place where it had been made perfectly clear that we were not welcome, and we didn't even want to be there. We were accidental agents provocateurs, simply because we had been waved on at the gate. \"The hotel is deserted,\" I said, as we pulled into the car park. \"We're the only people here.\" \"Let's get lunch,\" said Jim. \"Just two guys getting lunch.\" We wandered through the now-deserted marble lobby. There were no more civilians. We walked out into the silent grounds and sat at the poolside bar, the only two customers in a hotel designed for thousands. A young waitress appeared. \"Ma'am,\" said Jim, raising his trilby. \"Sir?\" she said. \"What time do you get off work?\" The question seemed to startle her. \"Nine o'clock,\" she said, cautiously. \"And what bars do you like drinking in?\" said Jim. \"There are some nice bars in the village near the cathedral.\" \"Any bars in particular?\" Jim laughed. \"Don't worry. I'm buying.\" \"Just lots of nice bars in the village,\" she said, evenly. \"That's good information,\" said Jim. \"Thank you, ma'am,\" he called after her. He turned to me. \"Now we know where the waiting staff drink. Could be good contacts.\" \"So,\" I said, \"shall we try the bars near the cathedral?\" \"Sure,\" he said. \"Will we go, then?\" \"Okay,\" said Jim. We walked back to the car and began driving the half-mile towards the exit. I glanced into my rear-view mirror. A dark green Lancia had pulled out behind us. \"Jim,\" I said. \"Mmm?\" \"I think we're being followed.\" Jim turned around. \"No shit,\" he grinned. \"Don't worry. Once we're on the public highway, they'd be pretty foolish to try anything.\" \"Okay,\" I said. \"They're not going to want to have a fat old dead reporter on the side of the road,\" said Jim. \"That's too big a news story.\" \"Okay,\" I said. \"But here they could say, 'Oh, we thought they were armed. They looked threatening. We told them to stop but they didn't stop.' Bango!\" \"I get the picture,\" I said. A flock of geese wandered idly up the drive in front of me. I honked my horn. We finally reached the peach gates. \"You watch,\" said Jim. \"He'll turn around now. He's done his job. Poor fool.\" But the Lancia didn't turn around. It began to follow us down the deserted lane. \"Uh oh,\" said Jim. *** \"British Embassy.\" \"Okay,\" I said, \"I'm a journalist from London. I'm calling you on the road from Sintra to Estoril . . .\" \"Hold on.\" \"Press office.\" \"I'm a journalist from London,\" I said. \"I'm calling you on the road from Sintra to Estoril. I'm being tailed, right now, by a dark green Lancia belonging to the Bilderberg Group.\" There was a sharp intake of breath. \"Go on,\" she said. \"I'm sorry,\" I said, \"but I just heard you take a sharp breath.\" \"Bilderberg?\" she said. \"Yes,\" I said. \"They watched us scouting around the Caesar Park Hotel and they've been following us ever since. We have now been followed for three hours. I wasn't sure at first, so I stopped my car on the side of a deserted lane and he stopped his car right in front of us. Can you imagine just how chilling that moment was? This is especially disconcerting because I'm from England and I'm not used to being spied on.\" \"Do you have Bilderberg's permission to be in Portugal?\" she said. \"Do they know you are here?\" \"No,\" I said. \"Bilderberg are very secretive,\" she said. \"They don't want people looking into their business. What are you doing here?\" \"I am essentially a humorous journalist,\" I explained. \"I am a humorous journalist out of my depth. Do you think it might help if we tell them that?\" From the corner of my eye, I saw Jim wind down his window. He leant his head out and blew an antagonising lady-like kiss at the Lancia. \"Hold on a second,\" I said. \"Jim!\" I said, sternly. \"Please stop that.\" I lowered my voice. \"I'm here with an American,\" I said, \"called Big Jim Tucker. He's an agent provocateur. That might be the problem. Perhaps you can phone Bilderberg and explain that I may be in the car with Jim Tucker, but I'm not actually with him.\" \"Listen\"' she said, urgently, \"Bilderberg is much bigger than we are. We're very small. We're just a little embassy. Do you understand? They're way out of our league. All I can say is go back to your hotel and sit tight.\" \"I'm actually just pulling into our hotel car park right now. The Paris Hotel in Estoril. He's right behind me. He's pulling up on the street right next to the hotel. He's getting out of his car . . .\" \"Sit tight,\" she said. \"I'll make some phone calls. Whatever happens, don't incite them in any way. Don't fan the flames.\" Before the chase had begun, Jim was lumbering and supine. Now he jumped out of the car with the agility of a young deer. The man from the Lancia climbed out of his car and took up a position behind a tree. He was young, in his 30s, with short black hair. He wore sunglasses and a dark green suit. \"I can see you!\" sang Jim. \"You're behind the tree. Peek-a-boo! Smile pretty for my idiot-proof camera.\" \"Jim,\" I said, \"will you stop that.\" But everything was beyond my control. It was as if the invigoration of the chase had transformed Jim into a sprightly teenager. A one-sided game of peek-a-boo ensued, during which the chaser maintained a steely expression behind his sunglasses, Jim performed a little ballet dance, and I sidled towards the swimming-pool area, attempting to distance myself from the unfolding crisis. Jim wandered over to me. \"Am I being paranoid,\" he said, \"or did Bilderberg set a trap for us? No, listen. Yesterday, we saw the shut-down begin. We saw it with our own eyes. Today, surprise surprise, no shut-down. They let us in with a smile . . .\" Jim trailed off. Continued",

      "bodyText": "Macedonia yesterday closed its borders with Kosovo for the second time in less than a week, trying to insulate itself against renewed fighting on two fronts by ethnic Albanian militants. Having a substantial Albanian population, Macedonia is desperate to prevent ethnic campaigners in Kosovo causing splits in Macedonia. On Thursday, US peacekeepers took positions on the Kosovo side of one segment of the border to try to prevent the infiltration of Macedonia by fighters. But the US force has been criticised as a rather timid presence - which may have persuaded Skopje it had little choice but to try shutting the frontier. One policeman was killed when Albanian insurgents used mortars and automatic weapons to attack Yugoslav police in Lucane, in the Presevo valley of southern Serbia, an area which the militants want Belgrade to cede. Three policemen were wounded, Serbian authorities said. Thundering explosions could be heard in towns several kilometers from the fighting as the Yugoslav army used heavy artillery against the insurgents. Elsewhere a group of senior Macedonian government officials and aid workers were trapped for more than 18 hours in the Brest area after rebels fired rocket-launched grenades at their convoy near the border town in northern Macedonia. Fierce firing erupted three times during the night on Thursday and continued into yesterday morning. Witnesses in the nearby village of Gozince said they could see people shooting from the first floor of houses in Brest. The convoy, which included an army general and Macedonia's deputy interior minister, split up and left the area by car and on foot. They were then met by special forces who got them out in armoured personnel carriers and police cars. Macedonian security forces estimated the number of fighters at around 30. A Macedonian police spokesman, Stevo Pendarovski, said the convoy had been touring northern Macedonia assuring residents that the government was in control of the area after ethnic Albanian rebels evacuated their stronghold in the village of Tanusevci, which lies inside Macedonia on the Kosovo border about 7km north of Brest. Mr Pendarovski said many of the insurgents came from the group that evacuated Tanusevci but they had reinforcements from Kosovo. In New York, a UN spokesman expressed concern about the new border closure. \"This has a serious effect on Kosovo,\" said Manoel Almeida e Silva. \"Fuel needed to heat hospitals, to generate electricity and to power private and commercial vehicles is not getting into the province.\"",

People dress down to go to Turville. </p> <p>Before you get the wrong idea, let me explain. Turville is one of those decorative little villages that speckles the hills and valleys of the Chilterns with the sanctity of good taste. So fastidious are these clusters of flint and red-brick homes that they don't even reek of money, although they represent one of the great concentrations of wealth in the country. They are the rural bolt-holes of computer whizzes, bond dealers and media giants who have made it, and lots of it, for whom a better quality of life begins with the commute back from London.

By that time, the AP and I considered ourselves lucky to be getting anything at all, chaos in minor forms having invaded the meeting and greeting, the distribution of menus and the drink orders.

With the exception of the liquorice in the duckling's sauce and the tandoori vegetables, there isn't anything wildly outr\u00e9 about such dishes, but I think most of us would find something to relate to.

The media may portray the psychopath as a crazed serial killer - the stuff of nightmares and horror films - but the reality is chillingly different. Not all psychopaths are violent criminals and fewer still have a desire to eat you for dinner. Many are highly successful businessmen and women, lawyers, academics, politicians, doctors and teachers. Psychopaths wear suits too... in fact, there could be one in your office. </p> <p>According to a recent news report, an Australian psychiatrist and criminal profiler is planning a series of lectures to show employers how to spot psychopaths at work. University of Sydney psychologist John Clarke believes it's essential that employers learn how to identify psychopaths in order to reduce problems in the workplace. </p> <p>Clarke says workplace psychopaths have the same psychological make-up as killers. The only difference is that they have the ability to hide their psychopathic tendencies behind the front of a respectable, white-collar job. Employers should beware liars, cheaters, smooth-talkers, people who appear bored, those who change jobs quickly and those who believe they should be higher up in the company; all are potential psychopaths. (Note that recent studies have discovered that 15% of top executives misrepresent their education, and one-third of all CVs contain lies.) </p> <p>Psychopaths aren't mad: they're sane, rational, often highly intelligent individuals. What separates them from the norm is a series of character traits - among them impulsiveness, egocentricity, lack of empathy and irresponsibility - which make them a highly dangerous and destructive force in society. No-one is certain exactly what causes a person to be </p> <p>psychopathic, although it is now generally believed that psychopaths are born, not made. As yet, psychopathy can neither be cured nor successfully treated. </p> <p>Robert Hare, professor of psychology at the University of Vancouver, is considered to be one of the world's foremost experts in the study of psychopathy. He estimates that about 1% of the population are psychopaths. \"Psychopaths use superficial charm, manipulation, intimidation, and violence to control others and satisfy their own selfish needs,\" he says. \"They lack conscience and feelings for others, cold-bloodedly take what they want and do as they please, violating social norms and expectations without the slightest guilt or regret.\" </p> <p>In the go- getting, ruthless world of modern business, such personal qualities are often valued and encouraged. </p> <p>The result? A psychopath who stays on the right side of the law can go far, charming and manipulating their way to the top of the career ladder and treading on those in their way. \"These individuals are every bit as egocentric, callous and manipulative as the average criminal psychopath,\" says Robert Hare. \"However, their intelligence, family background, social skills and circumstances permit them to construct a facade of normalcy and to get what they want with relative impunity.\" </p> <p>Tim Field, author of Bully in Sight , is convinced that the manager whose relentless bullying ruined his career, health and marriage, was a psychopath. After researching thousands of cases of bullying at work, he now believes that 90% of bullying incidents are committed by serial bullies, the majority of whom have psychopathic characteristics. He's currently writing a book about psychopaths in the workplace. </p> <p>\"I estimate that one person in 30, male or female, is a serial bully,\" he states. \"Like the textbook psychopath, serial bullies are emotionally cold, compulsive liars and experts at mimicry and deception. They sail through psychometric tests with flying colours and are masters of the latest workplace jargon, which is sure to impress management. They tend to rise swiftly through the ranks, giving them the ideal position to target those below them. </p> <p>\"While, on the surface, the psychopathic bully might seem to have the organisation's best interests at heart, his only objectives are power, control, domination and subjugation. By the time this is realised, the damage is done. Employers are in denial, even though serial bullying is estimated to cost the taxpayer between \u00a312bn and \u00a330bn per year.\" </p> <p>Tim says that in 98% of cases, the serial bully will target one individual, while charming and deceiving everyone else. This individual will be isolated from colleagues, subjected to public humililiation and tormented until they leave or break down. The bully will then move on to the next victim. If they sense that information detrimental to their reputation is being spread, the bully will create conflict between those who are collating this negative information. </p> <p>In Tim's opinion, female serial bullies are more dangerous than their male counterparts. \"They're more devious, more manipulative and will often persuade male colleagues to do their dirty work for them. They're less likely to resort to violence, so less likely to get spotted or cross over into criminal behaviour.\" </p> <p>According to Tim, most serial bullies have a Jekyll and Hyde nature: \"They are vile, vicious and vindictive in private, but innocent and charming in front of witnesses. No-one can - or wants to - believe this individual has a vindictive nature. Only the current target of the bully's aggression sees both sides. Whilst the Jekyll side is described as 'charming' and convincing enough to deceive personnel, management and a tribunal, the Hyde side is frequently described as 'evil'. Hyde is the real person, Jekyll an act.\" </p> <p>Whether or not there are more psychopaths around today is debatable. But Dr Paul Babiak, an industrial-organisational psychologist in New York, believes psychopaths thrive in the current business climate. Speaking at the annual meeting of the American Neuropsychiatric Association, he said the organisational chaos that typifies many of today's rapidly growing, downsizing and merging companies is the ideal environment for the psychopath to achieve success. </p> <p>So, what should you do if you suspect you are working for, or alongside, a psychopath? There are no easy answers. Work with a psychopath and you'll either unwittingly collude or become a victim. Even Robert Hare admits that he has fallen prey to the charm of psychopaths on several occasions. </p> <p>Unless you can prove a psychopath has committed fraud or another criminal offence, the law provides little protection. \"Current sexual, race and disability discrimination legislation does nothing to deter workplace psychopaths,\" says Tim Field. \"If anything, it just gives them the opportunity to find new ways of expressing their tendencies which aren't covered by law. </p> <p>\"Any perceived 'vulnerability' can be enough to make you a target - even if it's just your need for secure employment. In fact, the majority of people who come to me with accounts of being bullied are popular and good at their jobs. The highest performers are targeted so the bully can take credit for their achievements. </p> <p>\"If you think your manager is a psychopath the only thing I can advise is to get out before the damage is done. The more you recognise them for what they are the more you'll become a target.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Work is a brilliant way to meet and make friends. A recent Industrial Society survey suggests that 33% of us meet new friends at work. However, it's also a brilliant way to meet all kinds of people you'd happily pay to avoid. </p> <p>And it can get pretty nasty. In one case, colleagues were so resentful about a man's sexist comments that they all accepted invitations to his wedding then didn't show up. In another office, two colleagues fell out when one refused to cover for the other, and ended up communicating only through their managers. </p> <p>Jane Clarke, author of Office Politics (The Industrial Society), comments: \"When colleagues dislike each other, it's incredibly wasteful of everybody's time, leads to lots of misunderstandings and has a terrible impact on the work atmosphere.\" </p> <p>The most common reasons why colleagues dislike each other are a clash of personalities, different ways of working, competition, distrust, prejudice or a festering grievance. </p> <p>Sarah-Louise Taylor, a content provider for a dot.com, knows all about personality clashes. \"I'm very opinionated,\" she states. \"So, if someone's really wishy-washy and indecisive, that bothers me. I've heard that if you don't like someone, you should get to know them. But that just gives me more ammunition.\" </p> <p>Cathy Walton, an occupational psychologist, points out that \"it's important to analyse why you dislike the other person. Otherwise, you can expend an awful lot of negative energy instead of approaching the problem constructively. Ask yourself whether you habitually dislike a particular kind of person. Which issues do you disagree on? Which do you agree on? Is it a lack of trust or have you hurt each other?\" </p> <p>Unwittingly, we're all attracted and repelled by certain types of people and behaviour. By analysing your own behaviour and preferences, you can start to repair a working relationship. </p> <p>\"Someone who's very logical and rational will often think that a fast-acting, results-orientated person is dishonest,\" says Jane Clarke. \"But they just have a different working style. It's a question of understanding the difference, tolerating it and finally exploiting the value of that difference. </p> <p>\"Look at yourself in as objective a way as possible. Think about the upside of the way you work and the downside. So yes, you might be rational and reliable, but you also need to acknowledge that others might perceive you as slow and dogmatic.\" </p> <p>Many recent graduates are understandably nervous about appearing confrontational towards someone they dislike. \"You spend the first year being worried about falling out with people and what it could do to your future,\" says Thorkild Larsen, a graphic designer for an advertising agency. \"I know I've deliberately played it safe.\" </p> <p>It can be a tricky balance between bottling up your feelings and approaching the problem in such a full-on way that you alienate people. If you read up on assertiveness techniques (try Assertiveness at Work by Ken and Kate Back), you'll discover ways to express yourself that don't leave you or others feeling steam-rollered. </p> <p>\"The crucial element that helps you deal with other people is empathy,\" says Jane Clarke. So, consider whether the other person is acting this way because they feel challenged, competitive or jealous. How might your personality or behaviour be affecting the way they act at work? </p> <p>She offers the following advice for solving workplace conflict: </p> <p>Nip trouble in the bud.

      "bodyText": "Work is a brilliant way to meet and make friends. A recent Industrial Society survey suggests that 33% of us meet new friends at work. However, it's also a brilliant way to meet all kinds of people you'd happily pay to avoid. And it can get pretty nasty. In one case, colleagues were so resentful about a man's sexist comments that they all accepted invitations to his wedding then didn't show up. In another office, two colleagues fell out when one refused to cover for the other, and ended up communicating only through their managers. Jane Clarke, author of Office Politics (The Industrial Society), comments: \"When colleagues dislike each other, it's incredibly wasteful of everybody's time, leads to lots of misunderstandings and has a terrible impact on the work atmosphere.\" The most common reasons why colleagues dislike each other are a clash of personalities, different ways of working, competition, distrust, prejudice or a festering grievance. Sarah-Louise Taylor, a content provider for a dot.com, knows all about personality clashes. \"I'm very opinionated,\" she states. \"So, if someone's really wishy-washy and indecisive, that bothers me. I've heard that if you don't like someone, you should get to know them. But that just gives me more ammunition.\" Cathy Walton, an occupational psychologist, points out that \"it's important to analyse why you dislike the other person. Otherwise, you can expend an awful lot of negative energy instead of approaching the problem constructively. Ask yourself whether you habitually dislike a particular kind of person. Which issues do you disagree on? Which do you agree on? Is it a lack of trust or have you hurt each other?\" Unwittingly, we're all attracted and repelled by certain types of people and behaviour. By analysing your own behaviour and preferences, you can start to repair a working relationship. \"Someone who's very logical and rational will often think that a fast-acting, results-orientated person is dishonest,\" says Jane Clarke. \"But they just have a different working style. It's a question of understanding the difference, tolerating it and finally exploiting the value of that difference. \"Look at yourself in as objective a way as possible. Think about the upside of the way you work and the downside. So yes, you might be rational and reliable, but you also need to acknowledge that others might perceive you as slow and dogmatic.\" Many recent graduates are understandably nervous about appearing confrontational towards someone they dislike. \"You spend the first year being worried about falling out with people and what it could do to your future,\" says Thorkild Larsen, a graphic designer for an advertising agency. \"I know I've deliberately played it safe.\" It can be a tricky balance between bottling up your feelings and approaching the problem in such a full-on way that you alienate people. If you read up on assertiveness techniques (try Assertiveness at Work by Ken and Kate Back), you'll discover ways to express yourself that don't leave you or others feeling steam-rollered. \"The crucial element that helps you deal with other people is empathy,\" says Jane Clarke. So, consider whether the other person is acting this way because they feel challenged, competitive or jealous. How might your personality or behaviour be affecting the way they act at work? She offers the following advice for solving workplace conflict: Nip trouble in the bud. The longer a dispute continues, the harder it is to resolve. Use an objective mediator. If you'd like help, why not ask another colleague or a trusted manager to negotiate? Try not to blame the other person. It's rarely one person's fault; both of you should be prepared to make concessions. Use role play to rehearse what you want to say and anticipate the other person's responses. Assume the other person means well. What you view as deliberately obstructive behaviour is more likely to be defensiveness. Assume you both want to resolve the problem. Animosity is draining for both sides; the other person probably wants to find a solution too. Finally, here's a radical idea: pretend you like the person. Spend a couple of minutes thinking about their positive qualities. Just imagining you no longer dislike someone can have a powerful effect. And who knows? You may even end up as friends. If you don't remember anything else... Remember that you are always going to come across people you dislike, and it will make your working life a great deal easier if you learn to make the most of different personality types.",

The Mail gave a page to Roger Scruton, the right-wing polemicist, to celebrate Britishness. \"The asylum racket,\" he wrote, \"has alerted the British people to the fact that their government will neither defend them from invasion, nor ask for proof of loyalty to the crown of England from those who settle here.\" But the overwhelming press sentiment of the week was of unease about the language used by Mr Hague. As the Times, which tends to steer a middle way on the euro, put it: \"Mr Hague has knowingly raised the political stakes. In so doing he has voluntarily engaged in his own European integration. Much of the continental right is flirting with blood and soil in a strident opposition to outsiders ... Mr Hague said on Sunday that 'British people are not narrow nationalists. They are not xenophobes'. That is precisely why they will not stampede to politicians who seem to be playing the race card from the bottom of the deck.\" By intentionally or otherwise identifying the Euro-sceptic position with views many potential Eurosceptics find unpalatable, Mr Hague has helped the euro supporters, as a reading of this week's press makes clear. It will turn out to have been a significant week for the euro. \u0095 Peter Cole is professor of journalism at Sheffield University Related special reports Special report: election countdown Special report: refugees in Britain",

      "body": "<p>In new faux documentary Best In Show, Harlan Pepper is a slow-witted Southerner with a bloodhound named Hubert. Pepper likes to fish and practice ventriloquism, but he also has another impressive trick: He's fairly decent at naming nuts: \"Cashew nut, pistachio nut... red pistachio nut...\" pause for reflection... \"Macadamia nut.\" Impressed? You might be when you realize that the scene was improvised by the actor who played Pepper: writer, comedy performer, composer and director Christopher Guest. In fact, every moment in this delightful dog-show satire was ad-libbed on the spot. And how many nuts can you name without a script?</p> <p><strong>Nuts? [offering him some nuts on the table] You want to name some nuts?</strong></p> <p>Ah, yes, that was a scary moment. I was driving this camper. And in most movies, actors don't actually drive their cars - they're towed. In this case, we couldn't afford it, so I was actually driving that thing. In a place where I had no idea where I was going. And I decided to do this nut thing. And I realized after a few nuts I didn't know any more nuts.</p> <p><strong>I'd love to talk about the form of the mocudrama.</strong></p> <p>I don't like the term, personally. I would say that they are movies done in a documentary style. But I don't like that \"mockumentary\" or the \"rockumentary\" thing, because I think maybe it's just too glib or something. I don't have a clever name for them. No one has. If you do, you get a bonus.</p> <p><strong>But what fascinates you about this form?</strong></p> <p>I'm fascinated by real-time behaviour. When you hear someone talking in a restaurant or overhear someone on the street, there's a very different pattern of conversation to what you hear in a conventional movie. I'm fascinated by what to many people might be boring, or repetitive even. Our takes are typically 10 minutes long - in a conventional movie a scene might be a minute-and-a-half, two minutes. But they give us a very fluid and organic feel. I've put a tremendous amount of trust in these actors to deliver this kind of movie. They know what the intention of the scene is, but there are no lines written down, and the first time you hear it, that's it - that's the first time it was said. I've tried to make all these analogies to what we're doing, mostly with music. Like jazz - where's the music coming from? They're making it up as they go. Same in these films. This is actor jamming.</p> <p><strong>It can be a curse as much as a blessing, though, can't it?</strong></p> <p>The only curse, and I wouldn't even call it a curse, is that I end up with, in this case, close to 60 hours of material to edit down. And yes, lots of it is funny, but there's also a linear story, and if it doesn't service the story, it's out. And I'm very brutal about this at this point.</p> <p><strong>Some of the actors seem almost scripted, like the inept TV commentator played by Fred Willard.</strong></p> <p>Fred particularly gets to me, in a way that I really couldn't be in scenes with him in the film, because he'd just get me going. He's truly on another planet - it is astounding. He came in and he did his part all in one day, and there was no dog show going on in front of him - we had it at another time. So he's not even looking at anything. I was laughing so hard that I literally couldn't watch. I was doubled over, tears running down, and as this was happening I was thinking, \"You're directing this movie, you might want to watch what's actually going on.\" And I couldn't. Really, truly couldn't.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In new faux documentary Best In Show, Harlan Pepper is a slow-witted Southerner with a bloodhound named Hubert. Pepper likes to fish and practice ventriloquism, but he also has another impressive trick: He's fairly decent at naming nuts: \"Cashew nut, pistachio nut... red pistachio nut...\" pause for reflection... \"Macadamia nut.\" Impressed? You might be when you realize that the scene was improvised by the actor who played Pepper: writer, comedy performer, composer and director Christopher Guest. In fact, every moment in this delightful dog-show satire was ad-libbed on the spot. And how many nuts can you name without a script? Nuts? [offering him some nuts on the table] You want to name some nuts? Ah, yes, that was a scary moment. I was driving this camper. And in most movies, actors don't actually drive their cars - they're towed. In this case, we couldn't afford it, so I was actually driving that thing. In a place where I had no idea where I was going. And I decided to do this nut thing. And I realized after a few nuts I didn't know any more nuts. I'd love to talk about the form of the mocudrama. I don't like the term, personally. I would say that they are movies done in a documentary style. But I don't like that \"mockumentary\" or the \"rockumentary\" thing, because I think maybe it's just too glib or something. I don't have a clever name for them. No one has. If you do, you get a bonus. But what fascinates you about this form? I'm fascinated by real-time behaviour. When you hear someone talking in a restaurant or overhear someone on the street, there's a very different pattern of conversation to what you hear in a conventional movie. I'm fascinated by what to many people might be boring, or repetitive even. Our takes are typically 10 minutes long - in a conventional movie a scene might be a minute-and-a-half, two minutes. But they give us a very fluid and organic feel. I've put a tremendous amount of trust in these actors to deliver this kind of movie. They know what the intention of the scene is, but there are no lines written down, and the first time you hear it, that's it - that's the first time it was said. I've tried to make all these analogies to what we're doing, mostly with music. Like jazz - where's the music coming from? They're making it up as they go. Same in these films. This is actor jamming. It can be a curse as much as a blessing, though, can't it? The only curse, and I wouldn't even call it a curse, is that I end up with, in this case, close to 60 hours of material to edit down. And yes, lots of it is funny, but there's also a linear story, and if it doesn't service the story, it's out. And I'm very brutal about this at this point. Some of the actors seem almost scripted, like the inept TV commentator played by Fred Willard. Fred particularly gets to me, in a way that I really couldn't be in scenes with him in the film, because he'd just get me going. He's truly on another planet - it is astounding. He came in and he did his part all in one day, and there was no dog show going on in front of him - we had it at another time. So he's not even looking at anything. I was laughing so hard that I literally couldn't watch. I was doubled over, tears running down, and as this was happening I was thinking, \"You're directing this movie, you might want to watch what's actually going on.\" And I couldn't. Really, truly couldn't.",

I haven't seen such enthusiastically participatory audiences anywhere outside the Indian subcontinent. This can get irritating, for example when a big guy with his ass hanging out of his pants moans and groans loudly every time Penelope Cruz appears on screen in All the Pretty Horses (\"My God, she's so beautiful! Oh, oh, he's going to fall for her! Unh-unh, here comes trouble!\"), or when a five-year-old insistently asks her parents, during the interminable Cast Away, \"Mommy, when is the volleyball going to talk?\" (Footnote: Wilson the volleyball's performance is the best thing in this leaden movie.

I can't remember ever seeing a western audience react to a new film the way a packed afternoon audience on La Brea responded to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.

Akira Kurosawa and Satyajit Ray reached smaller audiences, in their native Japan and India, than the commercial movies of their contemporaries. That doesn't make The Seven Samurai inauthentic, or the trashy products of mainstream Bombay cinema \"more Indian\" than Ray's masterworks. So, yes, Jackie Chan sells a lot of tickets, and, yes, Crouching Tiger draws on a long tradition of martial-arts movies. But Jackie Chan movies are cardboard fun, and Ang Lee's beautiful, intimate epic is - one would have thought self-evidently - a luminous work of art. </p> <p>In the context of the Academy awards and the shadow of the strike, the success of Crouching Tiger is especially significant. It is being talked about as the breakthrough movie that has taught Americans to accept subtitled films into the giantcineplexes where the big money is made. And this is why the various players - but the studios above all - may be making a big mistake if they think they can ride out the strike without losing their stranglehold on the market. In the 1960s and early 70s, a flood of great non-American film-makers prised Hollywood's fingers off the cinema's throat for a few years.

And it may just be that the mass audience is ready, at long last, to enjoy rather more diversity in its cultural diet.

Ridley Scott's technically brilliant but woodenly scripted Gladiator is the big-studio candidate for honours, just as the latest sentimental Miramax confection, Chocolat, leads the charge of the smaller guys.

There's no nomination for George Clooney's delicious, hairnet- wearing performance in this movie, or indeed for Ren\u00e9e Zellweger's moving, subtle work in the title role of Nurse Betty.

      "body": "<p>Despite its glorication of the dove-like Kennedy clan, its tedious running time and its galling self-importance, Cuban-missile-crisis thriller Thirteen Days brings back something that's been absent from our screens for way too long: nuclear paranoia. Yes, that good old-fashioned awareness that we have the capacity to annihilate our planet in an afternoon, which seemed to go out of fashion along with puffball skirts and the iron curtain. You can virtually buy a nuclear warhead on eBay these days, international aggression is a growth industry, despotic rulers a dime a dozen, but you'd never guess this from the movies. After decades of wariness, Hollywood has taken a new line on the bomb: it's a really good thing. </p> <p>The bomb has always been a tricky subject for Hollywood: the ultimate nightmare but also the ultimate special effect. Back in the cold war era no producer would have dreamed of spicing up a picture with nuclear pyrotechnics, although the thought was obviously always on their minds. In those censorious times, they strained to come up with ways of tapping into that paranoia without mentioning it. Thus we had nuclear mutation causing giant ants, lizards, rabbits and teenagers to take over the world, or we had Body Snatchers, Martians and other aliens laying waste to our cities, or stray planets on a collision course with earth.</p> <p>Even in the \"permissive\" 60s and 70s, it was a rare thing to see a nuclear explosion on screen. In these peace-loving times, the industry coyly stuck to close shaves and near misses, such as Sidney Lumet's Fail-Safe - in which the US accidentally orders a nuclear strike on Moscow - or The China Syndrome, whose trouble-at-the-power-station plot prediction came true within a matter of days thanks to the Three Mile Island incident. The only exception to the rule was, as usual, Stanley Kubrick. If there was a new paranoia going around, Kubrick usually got it worse than anyone else, and nuclear war was no exception. In the 60s he had his own desktop nuclear attack simulator, and had collected 70 or 80 books on the subject before deciding to make a film about it. His mordant satire Doctor Strangelove was originally intended to be a serious thriller, but one night, according to co-writer Terry Southern, \"he woke up and realised that nuclear war was too outrageous, too fantastic to be treated in any conventional manner.\" So he ditched the happy ending, blew up the world and laughed all the way to the bunker.</p> <p>Nuclear paranoia entered its golden age while I was growing up. As a schoolboy in the 80s, I was convinced that a mushroom cloud would blossom on the horizon at any moment, ideally during maths. We'd then spend three weeks living under a door propped against a wall while fire rained and dogs melted outside, and we'd spend the rest of our mutated lives scrabbling for radioactive turnips on the charred wastelands of Surrey. The whole of 80s society seemed to be telling us we weren't going to make it past adolescence: reassuring government advice leaflets called Protect And Survive (\"you cannot remove radiation from water by boiling it\"); friendly children's books such as Raymond Briggs' When The Wind Blows; and cheerful pop ditties Enola Gay and Two Tribes - particularly that floor-filling \"dance mix\" sampling nuclear attack instructions.</p> <p>Worst of all were the films. A whole cycle of worst-case-scenario \"entertainment\" kicked in, creating some of the most depressing and disturbing movies ever made. First there was Testament, a modestly harrowing saga of nuclear war, with Thirteen Days star Kevin Costner in a minor role. The Day After upped the stakes, subjecting its cast to the unforgiving ravages of anarchy and radioactivity until they were reduced to decomposing zombies, cowering in the rubble of humanity. Just when things couldn't get any worse, the BBC unveiled its docu-drama Threads. Written by Barry \"Kes\" Hines, Threads was to The Day After what Coronation Street was to Dynasty. The Sheffield setting was depressing enough before the bombs hit, but after a few hours of communal terror, scientifically accurate carnage and women giving birth to mutant babies, the nation was on the verge of mass suicide. The film has effectively been banned by the BBC since 1984 - not that anybody wanted to watch it again.</p> <p>When these bleak years finally came to an end with collapse of the Soviet Union, the world breathed a sigh of relief - especially movie producers. Now that the threat had evaporated (if not the weapons themselves), the atomic x could be administered to more upbeat action movies without triggering panic. Hollywood learned to stop worrying and love the bomb. Where a nuclear explosion was once the ultimate catastrophe, now it wasn't really that bad after all. In fact, better that it did go off - something for the special effects department to do, as long as there were no consequences. John Woo set one off in Broken Arrow (it's OK, it was underground), Independence Day fired a few at flying saucers (what's a little fallout when there's Martians to deal with?), but dick-waver number one in this category was James Cameron. Before Titanic, he could hardly make a picture without a nuclear element: The Abyss (stolen warhead alert), Aliens (set in a nuclear power station which explodes spectacularly at the climax), Terminator 2 (horrifically realistic visions of \"Judgement Day\"). Most incredible of all was the action \"comedy\" True Lies, which employs a mushroom cloud as a photogenic backdrop for Arnie and Jamie Lee Curtis to embrace in front of.</p> <p>So the war has been won. Movies have finally annihilated the threat of nuclear annihilation. The final step in the \"H-bombs are your friends\" campaign has been made in recent years - trawling back to the 50s for old sci-fi plots to jazz up, two teams simultaneously rehashed the old When Worlds Collide theme: Armageddon and Deep Impact. No cold war allegory or political dimension this time, just the world versus a meteorite. And how to divert the meteorite and avoid global catastrophe? Nuclear weapons. Likewise John Travolta's sci-fi folly Battlefield Earth. How to eradicate the enslaving aliens? Nuke their home planet. Atomic weapons don't threaten the world, they save it. Nuclear proliferation may be alive in the real world but, according to Hollywood, there's nothing to worry about. Which is why, for all its faults, Thirteen Days is doing something vaguely controversial. Even if its nuclear threat is safely sealed in 1962, the film at least reminds us that there was one, once. Now all we need is someone to remake Threads.</p>",

First, the pressure to justify a budget that started at $100m, then crept up to $200m. Then there was messianic writer-director James Cameron, who bossed his ship like a combination of Captains Bligh, Ahab and Queeg. The shoot in Mexico lasted more than a year, and accommodations were filled with British actors who sat around for months before they got to deliver their lines. Kate Winslet spent days in heavy period dresses and high heels that made it impossible to stay afloat, making for some hairy moments one day when the dress got caught and held her under water a tad too long. Cameraman Caleb Deschanel quit because \"Jim Cameron is like the scene in Spinal Tap when the amps go up to eleven.\" Cameron calls his onset persona \"Mij - the anti-Jim. I don't like myself when I'm Mij.\" Neither did anyone else.</p> <p><strong>Apocalypse Now</strong></p> <p>Production on Apocalypse Now took so long - nearly five years - that bit-part player Harrison Ford, who shot his scenes early on, was a Star Wars superstar by the time Apocalypse was finally released in 1979. The 238-day shoot in the Philippines is justly famous: Coppola, fresh off the second Godfather, was at the height of his fame and living at the outer limits of his ego. By the time he came back from the jungles, after hurricanes had destroyed all his sets, his leading man had had a heart-attack so serious he was given the last rites, the film's finale had been completely capsized by the megalomania of an unbelievably tubby Marlon Brando, the budget had gone from $12m to $31m, and Coppola had convinced both the press and his own wife that he had lost his mind. It's arguable that the arduous, booze- and drug-filled shoot bankrupted his talent as well. Certainly nothing he's made since that comes anywhere near it.</p> <p><strong>Fitzcarraldo</strong></p> <p>Werner Herzog is the kind of director you work with if you want life to be all hairy, all the time. He made his first film with stolen cameras, hypnotised his entire crew for Heart Of Glass, released a plague of rats into Delft for Nosferatu, landed a documentary crew on a volcano that was about to rip and once drew a gun on his star Klaus Kinski, screaming: \"Act, motherfucker. Act!\" Fitzcarraldo was the story of a conventionally Herzogian maniac (Kinski, no surprises) who pulls a steamship over a mountain. Herzog decided he would do the same - with a real boat. And all this after having shot half of the film, lost his entire cast (Mick Jagger, Jason Robards), waited two years and started all over again. \"We were cursed,\" Herzog recalled. There were battles between local Indian tribes, Kinski was monumentally egotistical from start to finish (\"he can scream in a way you cannot believe\" - Herzog), brain-eating parasites lurked in the water, a plane crash paralysed one of the extras, and another three were injured pulling the tub over the hill. \"After a while, even my best friends treated me like someone gone mad,\" said the director.</p> <p><strong>Easy Rider</strong></p> <p>Apocalypse Now demonstrated that the sign of a movie going out of control is having Dennis Hopper somewhere - anywhere - on the set. As one wag said of Easy Rider, \"One of the stars was a drunken hippy, one of the writers was an acid-fried biker, and the director was a paranoid control-freak. The bad news was that all three of them were Dennis Hopper.\" There were no tornadoes or natural disasters on the Easy Rider set, unless you count Hopper, who was given to booze-fuelled tantrums, deep-seated anger, and paranoia that everyone else was trying to rip him off or \"fuck with my vision!\" If anything, Hopper's next movie title - The Last Movie - proved accurate and he was run out of Hollywood all over again.</p> <p><strong>The Wild Bunch</strong></p> <p>Sam Peckinpah never made life easy for himself. On almost every movie he made he got into a suicidal feud with whoever was in charge of production - even his own friends - and The Wild Bunch was no different. In the meantime, he was also engaged in life-or-death struggles with booze, pills, cocaine and a range of durable personal demons. Oh, and he was a terrifying perfectionist. And a genius. None of which explains the amazing loyalty he earned from his casts and crew. For the story of a group of ageing outlaws fading away gracelessly, Peckinpah wanted realistic blood and lots of it. His final gunfight was shot on a set wired up with 10,000 squibs filled with fake blood and chunks of meat - painful for the actors who endured multiple takes - and, as one of the crew claimed, \"more ammunition was used in that final battle than in the entire Mexican Revolution - only we were using blanks.\"</p> <p><strong>Ryan's Daughter</strong></p> <p>The film that broke David Lean's over-inflated reputation and kept him out of movie-making for 15 years. Lean had just come off Doctor Zhivago, in which his perfectionism led him to recreate the snow-blanketed Russian Steppe in the Spanish desert. Undeterred by the harrowing length of that shoot, he welcomed the opportunity to be equally obsessive on this, his romance set against the Irish Civil War. Most of the agony was confined to a scene when a shipment of arms is offloaded during a storm. \"It took months to do,\" said cameraman Freddie Francis. \"We'd get a storm warning and go down to this bit of coast where those storms come across the Atlantic right on to this beach. The storm would last an hour or two and then die away. So you'd usually get two or three minutes of footage before the storm disappeared. The waves were crashing right on to us, the wind was blowing the sea straight into the camera. We had to chain the camera down to the rocks and everybody was in wet suits. Some people were still blown over. Then we'd work on some other part of the film until we got another storm warning. In fact, when winter arrived and we still needed to shoot summer scenes, the first unit went to South Africa, leaving another unit to complete the storm sequence.\" Despite all this, Ryan's Daughter was a flop.</p>",

A captain of ships kneels, to be put in mind of a death in a far port, or at home, or on a rock of the sea. And the boy that holds cinders for the priest, His forehead is smeared, Who wears a coat of fourteen Aprils. The lady of Paplay Thinks, most mornings, she will live forever, kneeling now Is touched with the grave-stoor. The ploughman folds sun-grained hands, He tilts his face To the dust drained of warmth and light. Fisherman, the spindrift Will wash the ashes from you tomorrow. Still you remember, between two waves, St Peter and the fire of his denials. And the old bishop, 'I know this, One God-ground deed or thought Endures, when the circle of diamond-and-gold on my finger is dust.' In the kirk of Magnus Stood a multitude of islanders, death-farers that day, Hungry, after, for panis angelicus. And unto dust thou shalt return Tolstoy He sits at an oak desk, The old lordly peasant, There is fire about his heart. In the crucible of his heart The ore is troubled. He swings a scythe, In a field, with serfs, Count Leo Tolstoy, In the sweat of his brow He scatters the gold of a summer. He is home from the wars, Sword over hearthstone set. Now the greatest war Is there for a transmutation (this alchemy?) Bald Hills, Natasha, Borodino. Truth is a clear star. Men root among husks and roots. Clear and simple, the star.

Robert Service, as a prose stylist, is no Trotsky; but with his bland and strangely exculpatory account of Lenin's life we can finally claim to get some way inside the mind of one of the previous century's more enigmatic dictators (as well as the chance to carry around a large red book with \"Lenin\" printed on it in big letters, which guarantees the reader a wide berth on public transport). </p> <p>This is a boiled-down, rejigged version of Service's three-volume political life of Lenin, which was made possible by the opening up of Kremlin archives; until then, biographies of Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov were thin on the ground and hedged by protocol, dogma or fear. It emerges that the individual perhaps more responsible for the 20th century's shape than any other was not so much a monster as a weirdo - and not even a particularly outlandish weirdo. The ultimate policy wonk (even his death mask appears to be frowning in concentration), he was strict with himself and others. He had frighteningly little time for loafers; or, indeed, for much that distracted him from the business of the Revolution.

He may have been given to grim jokes about what he was going to do to the Mensheviks, but at least he had a sense of humour; and, when he took office in the Kremlin, one of the first things he did was get a cat, which would sleep in his armchair in the certainty that no one would disturb it.

It is not in any sense a walk in the park; but then, it's not Service's fault that Lenin spent so much time wrangling over policy in various socialist congresses. The passages which deal with Lenin's intellectual development - his reliance on a mixture of Marx, Hegel and Aristotle - are among the most interesting. Service goes a little dotty over Inessa Armand, who was probably Lenin's lover for a while (\"her nostrils were wonderfully flared\"), but the book's chief fault - which, I assume, comes with the territory of being a specialist in Soviet history - is that Service assumes a level of background knowledge the reader may well not possess. The transformation from plotter to ruler seems somehow magical; the picture of how much influence Lenin had before 1917 is unclear, as is the level of oppression in pre-revolutionary Russia (how many political prisoners and exiles were there, for instance?).

Behind the Scenes at the Museum had, she reckoned practically, about a one-in-three chance, the other likely contenders being Salman Rushdie and Roy Jenkins. And although she was delighted - and not at all averse to pocketing the \u00a321,000 cheque - the thrill of winning the prize fell somewhat short of a previous and far less glamorous trophy. </p> <p>In 1988, she won the Woman's Own Short Story Award with the first piece she'd ever sent off anywhere, and \"the first thing that was truly not about myself\". Learning that she'd won remains one of the best moments of her life; more importantly, it was the point at which she realised she had it in her to become A Writer. Until then, she was much more of a reader. As a child, she devoured her grandmother's encyclopedias - the source of an extensive general knowledge that amazes her daughters - and claims to have read Alice in Wonderland once a week for five years. Since she had no brothers or sisters, books provided both company and vital clues to the nature of the outside world, which seemed a terrifying contrast to the quiet, orderly life of the only child. Temperamentally gloomy and at times beset by indefinable fears, she lost herself in work. \"I had phenomenal inner drive,\" she remarks. \"I was very self-reliant in that way, and very puritanical.\" </p> <p>As the 1960s unfolded, Atkinson submitted readily to the work ethos of the single-sex Queen Anne Grammar School in York, where her parents ran a medical- and surgical-supplies shop. By the time she left home for Dundee University and an English degree, she was ready to break away, but clueless as to what she might find. \"I knew nothing about life,\" she says, \"I didn't even know where Dundee was.\" </p> <p>But Dundee, which features heavily in Atkinson's third novel, Emotionally Weird , was to become a significant city. At 21, she married a fellow student and had a child there, and around the same time embarked on a PhD. \"I thought doing a doctorate and having a baby would be a good combination. Actually, having a baby isn't a good combination with anything.\" </p> <p>But worse than the strain of juggling academia with motherhood was the moment her PhD - on the American short story - was refused at its viva. Atkinson believes interdepartmental politics played their part, and the injustice still rankles. At the time, she retreated into herself; now, she regards it as the making of her. \"Your life is made by the failures in it, not the successes,\" she says. \"And I wouldn't have become a writer without failing my doctorate.\" </p> <p>It was only after this cataclysm - and the break-up of her marriage - that she began to think about writing fiction, nagged at by a need \"to put something of myself down\". In her 30s, scraping a living for herself and her two daughters through menial jobs (most famously as a chambermaid) and bits of teaching, she started to jot down odds and ends. It wasn't really writing, she says, but a combination of biography and therapy, a way of \"making internal chaos into objective external order\". </p> <p>Atkinson is a striking mixture of alarming self-assurance and nervous fragility. Take, for example, two things that happened shortly after she garnered the Woman's Own award. First, she got an accountant, because she'd decided that \"women have to be grown-up about money\". Then, when she hit 40, she had a peculiar crisis that resulted in a year-long bout of agoraphobia. Psychiatrists proving useless, she got herself through it by reading vast numbers of books on phobias. </p> <p>That trauma beaten, Atkinson set to in earnest, and her much-vaunted \"overnight success\" followed swiftly. She was spotted by an agent, landed herself a book deal and wrote Behind the Scenes in three months. \"I never had a qualm about it,\" she remembers. \"I had great confidence in that book.\" But if the reading public - half a million of them, in this country alone - loved her multi-generational family saga, the media scrum had other ideas. </p> <p>\"With hindsight, I wouldn't have done so many interviews,\" she says. \"I wouldn't have indulged them - most of them were bitches.\" Considering that she was described in one banner headline as the writer who \"rejects marriage and the family, and believes we should live in tribes ruled by women\", this response might be viewed as mild. </p> <p>After Behind the Scenes came Human Croquet , the novel she regards as her darkest and also her best. For Emotionally Weird , subtitled \"A Comic Novel\", she drew on her childhood Alice obsession to engineer a bravura shaggy-dog story, complete with a migraine-inducing array of typefaces, a riotous campus and a stray canine. It may sound like a lark, but writing it was tough. Atkinson was \"so written out\" that she threw away her first year's work, and insists that she didn't know what she was doing until the end. Then, \"in a vague, mystical way\", it all came together. </p> <p>Atkinson is now working on the screenplay for the TV version of Behind the Scenes . How does the job of adaptation compare with novel-writing? \"Well,\" she admits, \"knowing what's going to happen is very boring.\"</p>",

It wasn't really writing, she says, but a combination of biography and therapy, a way of \"making internal chaos into objective external order\". Atkinson is a striking mixture of alarming self-assurance and nervous fragility. Take, for example, two things that happened shortly after she garnered the Woman's Own award. First, she got an accountant, because she'd decided that \"women have to be grown-up about money\". Then, when she hit 40, she had a peculiar crisis that resulted in a year-long bout of agoraphobia. Psychiatrists proving useless, she got herself through it by reading vast numbers of books on phobias. That trauma beaten, Atkinson set to in earnest, and her much-vaunted \"overnight success\" followed swiftly. She was spotted by an agent, landed herself a book deal and wrote Behind the Scenes in three months. \"I never had a qualm about it,\" she remembers. \"I had great confidence in that book.\" But if the reading public - half a million of them, in this country alone - loved her multi-generational family saga, the media scrum had other ideas. \"With hindsight, I wouldn't have done so many interviews,\" she says. \"I wouldn't have indulged them - most of them were bitches.\" Considering that she was described in one banner headline as the writer who \"rejects marriage and the family, and believes we should live in tribes ruled by women\", this response might be viewed as mild. After Behind the Scenes came Human Croquet , the novel she regards as her darkest and also her best. For Emotionally Weird , subtitled \"A Comic Novel\", she drew on her childhood Alice obsession to engineer a bravura shaggy-dog story, complete with a migraine-inducing array of typefaces, a riotous campus and a stray canine. It may sound like a lark, but writing it was tough. Atkinson was \"so written out\" that she threw away her first year's work, and insists that she didn't know what she was doing until the end. Then, \"in a vague, mystical way\", it all came together. Atkinson is now working on the screenplay for the TV version of Behind the Scenes . How does the job of adaptation compare with novel-writing? \"Well,\" she admits, \"knowing what's going to happen is very boring.\"",

The authors of this excellent, highly readable Baedeker examine the government's policy choices on every conceivable topic from GM crops to biological weapons, and weigh them on the scales. Their approach is to combine objectivity - setting New Labour's own claims as their yardstick - and their own social-democratic passion. Applying these tests, they give a verdict that falls in the middle. New Labour gets a beta-query-plus for effort and earnestness. But it could try harder. Is this harsh, or over-generous? In political style, New Labour has sought to present a brazen image, rejecting past puritanism. In terms of content, however, the new era has so far failed to dazzle. </p> <p>Over the last century, the party's fortunes have been mixed: six of Labour's nine election wins produced either minority governments or wafer-thin margins. Only three resulted in Labour governments confident of a full term. As the authors of this book show, New Labour in 1997 doesn't begin to compare for sheer audacity with the 1945 Attlee administration, which established Beveridge's welfare state, stuffed the doctors' mouths with gold to found the NHS, gave independence to India and founded Nato and the IMF in its spare time. Nor does it rival the much-criticised Harold Wilson government of the 1960s, which failed to tackle the economy but still found resources to revolutionise education and the courage to preside over a series of key legal changes (on hanging, divorce, censorship, abortion, homosexuality) that created a more civilised society. </p> <p>By contrast, the Blair administration has been prosaic in the context of plenty. Toynbee and Walker label one of their chapters \"It's The Economy, Clever\", reversing a Clinton slogan to remind us that it has been the best of times. Blair cannot use the economy as an excuse for actions not taken. Attlee and Wilson were beleaguered by financial problems. In the 1940s, Chancellor Hugh Dalton likened a run on the pound to \"watching a child bleed to death and being unable to stop it\"; in the 1960s, Chancellor Callaghan wept as he saw Britain's reserves draining away. Gordon Brown has inherited a sounder base than any predecessor since before the first world war. When Attlee's Britain fell short of a socialist utopia or Wilson abandoned his National Plan, it was possible to blame foreign speculators. Blair has no such alibi. If ever there was a government with the wherewithal to transform British society, it has surely been the present one. </p> <p>So why, apart from the serendipitous gift of Mr Hague as an opponent, is Labour destined to win? As Toynbee and Walker point out, politics is full of little ironies. The government of spin has been slow to provide deeds capable of capturing the public imagination. It has also been curiously gauche about projecting them. As a result, people remember the banana skins, not what ministers did.

But it was pragmatism with a social purpose. Indeed, there has been a neat paradox at the heart of New Labour practice: a left-wing government quietly playing down its achievements because of its fear of alienating Middle England. Thus, rather than simply wallowing in the warm bath of Tory-induced affluence, Blairism has provided a nervously busy ministry - a government of low-key, behind-the-scenes activity, carried out by inexperienced but serious-minded politicians who, for two years, were required to square the circle of helping the badly off while not adding any new calls on resources. </p> <p>Only after two years of Treasury-disciplined rigour, according to the authors, was the chancellor able to realise \"Tony Crosland's dream of floating the public services on an expanding economy\". The approach has been loaves and fishes: cunning widgets rather than quick fixes. Thus, the authors give Brown modestly good marks for \"keeping spending tighter than the Tories would have done\".

They had just heard that Indira Gandhi was dead, and were inconsolable throughout the flight. When we landed at New Delhi, the plane was immediately surrounded by police. In the distance columns of smoke were climbing into the sky over the old city, where Hindu mobs were massacring Sikhs in reprisal for Indira's assassination. Next day I sat with friends, watching the lying-in-state on television, with fans blowing cold air from great blocks of ice onto the body so that it wouldn't decompose. Later there was Rajiv Gandhi, shimmering in the heat haze as he walked seven times around his mother's pyre. I can remember every detail of that week with absolute clarity: like so much else about India, it was utterly indelible. </p> <p>As Katherine Frank suggests in this excellent biography, the carnage that broke out after the assassination - more than 2,000 Sikhs were slaughtered in Delhi alone - was a depressing indication that Indira Gandhi's great mission in life, which she had inherited from her father, had failed. For the Nehrus were dedicated to the notion of a secular state in which no creed or caste would dominate anyone else; where the religious card that had beggared and bloodied the country's history since the year dot could no longer be played. </p> <p>After many centuries of alien rule, first by the Mughals and then by the British, this was to be a democracy of unique and great distinction. Jawaharlal Nehru spent himself endlessly in this cause, and his daughter gave her life for it. The story of Indira Gandhi is a chronicle of what, between them, they did achieve; and although it is now spat upon by their infinitely less worthy successors, that was no small thing. </p> <p>The book is dominated by three tremendous figures: Mahatma Gandhi, part saint, part humbug, and unrelated to Indira; Jawaharlal, the highly westernised (Harrow and Cambridge) Kashmiri agnostic who steered his country into and through independence and put India on the world map in its own right; and Indira, the most tragic figure of the three because her life was cut off some distance short of her goal. The Mahatma had achieved the seemingly impossible by shaming the British (which took some doing) into leaving his country alone, and Jawaharlal had given India a sense of moral purpose and a truly democratic structure, which shone like a beacon across the corruption and oppression that passed for government throughout the rest of the old colonial world. </p> <p>Indira wanted to carry this on, and to do more: she wanted to put an end to her people's everlasting poverty, the more obscene because it was too often endured in the shadow of high walls protecting unimaginable wealth and privilege. She had a strangely sympathetic relationship with Margaret Thatcher, and it's easy to see why: both were strong-minded women with a clear sense of purpose who had made it to the top in a profession dominated by men, and both cherished deeply unattractive sons. There, however, the resemblance ended. Can anyone imagine the Grantham Grasper doing voluntary relief work in pestilential refugee camps, as Indira Gandhi did during the horrors of Partition? </p> <p>Two lesser characters helped to shape Indira's destiny. One was her Parsee husband Feroze Gandhi; they became estranged, yet she still felt a responsibility for him. The other was her younger boy Sanjay, a nasty piece of work who never did anything that was not fuelled by self-interest and who increasingly influenced his adoring mother into actions that strayed from the Nehru tradition. But the major figure in her life by a very long way was her father, who not only doted on her (as she did on him) but used her as a substitute confidante for her mother Kamala, who died when Indira was 19. She became his consort, and found herself slowly being lowered into the snakepit of Indian politics, as well as accompanying him on all his official journeys abroad. And although she never admitted it, the relationship eventually became a burden to her: until Nehru died, when she was 47, she could not feel that she was her own woman. </p> <p>Even after she had become prime minister herself - and an immensely popular one, at that - she was never completely free from men until the last four years of her life, by which time she was worn out and had lost her old balance. As long as Feroze was around, she was incapable of breaking free of him completely; and until Sanjay killed himself doing aerobatics, she was something of a tool in his hands. Though she herself was incorruptible, she too often turned a blind eye to his shabby little deals. This increased the enmity that had long come her way, notably from unpleasant rivals such as Morarji Desai, as well as from old men inside her own Congress party, all pursuing vendettas founded on jealousy. </p> <p> As Frank makes plain, Indira Gandhi was an imperfect woman, quite apart from her disturbing indulgence of Sanjay. She bore grudges, and had a notoriously acid tongue and a \"legendary genius for silence\", which she had learned from the Mahatma as a child and which, like him, she used as an intimidating weapon. She could be quite ruthless, as when she imposed the Emergency on a nation rapidly descending into chaos (it worked, despite all the hand-wringing by ignorant liberals in the west). She was once caught out in a case of electoral malpractice and paid for it under examination by the Shah Commission, which was itself later discredited for its political motivation. </p> <p>On the other hand, she went to the country in due time, knowing that she would be defeated in the wake of the Emergency; everyone had predicted that this was the end of democracy in India, but she was a Nehru and there was never any chance of that. After two years of Desai and a reversion to chaos, the country was very glad to vote her back in. She also masterminded the Green Revolution, which, for the first time in its history, made India self-sufficient in food. </p> <p>She died as she had lived, dedicated to her ideal. After the secessionist thug Bhindranwale had fortified the Golden Temple in Amritsar so that it was desecrated when the Indian Army stormed it, the chances of her being murdered were very high; she knew this so well that she started planning her own funeral. The intelligence service advised her to get rid of the Sikhs in her security detail, but she refused: India, she insisted, was a secular nation. Beant Singh and Satwant Singh therefore remained on duty at her residence, where they shot her in the garden one morning. And so she perished, bravely and with her dignity intact. India is now in very different hands, and all who care about that country must tremble for the future of its secular democracy.</p>",

There, however, the resemblance ended. Can anyone imagine the Grantham Grasper doing voluntary relief work in pestilential refugee camps, as Indira Gandhi did during the horrors of Partition? Two lesser characters helped to shape Indira's destiny. One was her Parsee husband Feroze Gandhi; they became estranged, yet she still felt a responsibility for him. The other was her younger boy Sanjay, a nasty piece of work who never did anything that was not fuelled by self-interest and who increasingly influenced his adoring mother into actions that strayed from the Nehru tradition. But the major figure in her life by a very long way was her father, who not only doted on her (as she did on him) but used her as a substitute confidante for her mother Kamala, who died when Indira was 19. She became his consort, and found herself slowly being lowered into the snakepit of Indian politics, as well as accompanying him on all his official journeys abroad. And although she never admitted it, the relationship eventually became a burden to her: until Nehru died, when she was 47, she could not feel that she was her own woman. Even after she had become prime minister herself - and an immensely popular one, at that - she was never completely free from men until the last four years of her life, by which time she was worn out and had lost her old balance. As long as Feroze was around, she was incapable of breaking free of him completely; and until Sanjay killed himself doing aerobatics, she was something of a tool in his hands. Though she herself was incorruptible, she too often turned a blind eye to his shabby little deals. This increased the enmity that had long come her way, notably from unpleasant rivals such as Morarji Desai, as well as from old men inside her own Congress party, all pursuing vendettas founded on jealousy. As Frank makes plain, Indira Gandhi was an imperfect woman, quite apart from her disturbing indulgence of Sanjay. She bore grudges, and had a notoriously acid tongue and a \"legendary genius for silence\", which she had learned from the Mahatma as a child and which, like him, she used as an intimidating weapon. She could be quite ruthless, as when she imposed the Emergency on a nation rapidly descending into chaos (it worked, despite all the hand-wringing by ignorant liberals in the west). She was once caught out in a case of electoral malpractice and paid for it under examination by the Shah Commission, which was itself later discredited for its political motivation. On the other hand, she went to the country in due time, knowing that she would be defeated in the wake of the Emergency; everyone had predicted that this was the end of democracy in India, but she was a Nehru and there was never any chance of that. After two years of Desai and a reversion to chaos, the country was very glad to vote her back in. She also masterminded the Green Revolution, which, for the first time in its history, made India self-sufficient in food. She died as she had lived, dedicated to her ideal. After the secessionist thug Bhindranwale had fortified the Golden Temple in Amritsar so that it was desecrated when the Indian Army stormed it, the chances of her being murdered were very high; she knew this so well that she started planning her own funeral. The intelligence service advised her to get rid of the Sikhs in her security detail, but she refused: India, she insisted, was a secular nation. Beant Singh and Satwant Singh therefore remained on duty at her residence, where they shot her in the garden one morning. And so she perished, bravely and with her dignity intact. India is now in very different hands, and all who care about that country must tremble for the future of its secular democracy.",

After all, Christopher Ricks published a collection of essays called The Force of Poetry in 1984. But it is the right title, one discovers, for James Fenton's enjoyable interrogation of what constitutes strength, both in life and poetic discourse.</p> <p>There is some background to this. In Articulate Energy, Donald Davie wrote about \"the strong line\" in a technical sense - simple syntax, finite verbs. It was an approach favoured by Dryden, a poet Fenton also discusses. Not respecting a poetry of gaseous elaboration or rhetorical posturing, Dryden preferred plainer virtues - toughness of thought and language. This idea of \"sinew\" (one of F R Leavis's favourite marks of approval) has been kept alive by later poets and critics. Ted Hughes - or \"T. Hews\", as Oliver Reynolds once had it in a jokey poem - was a writer critics could hardly describe except as \"muscular\".</p> <p>In his book, Ricks followed Dr Johnson's precept in looking for verse that \"calls new power into being, which embodies sentiment, and animates matter\" - rather as if the frog's leg of language were enlivened by the electricity of the poet's genius. Fenton is more concerned to show how such genius is forged by a lack of strength in the poet's life. A sense of lack, enfeeblement or humiliation (Auden thought life hurt us into poetry) is the unifying theme of the book. In this sense, The Strength of Poetry shares some characteristics with Edmund Wilson's theories about the relationship between writers' emotional lives and their work, as outlined in The Wound and the Bow. </p> <p>Fenton shows us how Larkin, for instance, drew perverse, enraged strength from being turned down for the army (bad eyesight) and for further war work (applying unsuccesfully to Bletchley Park), or from having a fascist father, who kept \"a statue of Hitler on the mantelpiece, which at the touch of a button leapt into a Nazi salute\".</p> <p>The relation of strength to betrayal is also considered: Sassoon's betrayal of his class, Pound's flirtation with fascism, Eliot's espousal of England over America, Auden's fleeing to America in the war years, Heaney's betrayal - as it is perceived in some quarters - of \"nationalism as represented by the IRA\". It is, says Fenton, \"astonishing how often in the poetry of this century this theme of betrayal crops up\".</p> <p>Subject of two of the lectures, Auden is the key in all this. Once again he is the father figure (as for John Fuller, to whom the book is dedicated) who can unlock the door to Fenton's roomy brain. \"Auden had the greatest gifts of any of our poets in the twentieth century, the greatest lap full of seed. And it was given him to know this, and to doubt it, to know and to doubt it.\" The relation of strength to self-doubt, and how they can betray each other, sometimes usefully (there was a kind of courage in Auden's flight), underpins the whole book. We are directed to the poem \"1929\", where Auden sketches the heroic qualities he lacked in the figure of a hustler with whom he had an affair: \"Absence of fear in Gerhart Meyer / From the sea, the truly strong man\".</p> <p>A Hamburg sailor, Gerhart was - Fenton tells us - always going off with whores and demanding presents. Recording in his journal how he himself postured, Charles Atlas-style, before the mirror, Auden compared his body with the sailor's, wondering whether he was \"up to his physical level\". If working the body was to be abandoned, he'd have to pump iron in verse, make himself strong in that place as he could in no other.</p> <p>It is in respect of this - of strength in poetic discourse - that Fenton introduces us to \"Blake Auden\" and \"James Auden\": \"Blake sat at Auden's left when he wrote, urging concision, definite views, plain language . . . not the Blake of the long line, the interminable prophetic books, but the fiery Blake of The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, the Blake of the notebooks. \"Henry James sat on Auden's right, suggesting fascinating syntaxes and ways of prolonging a sentence, giving a nuance to a nuance.\"</p> <p>But nuanced stuff, \"poetry\" (say it sneeringly), can be the pathetic resort as well as the making of a weakling - as in time of war, for example. In a fine lecture on Wilfred Owen's juvenilia, Fenton begins by mocking a terrible line. \"Excuse me: ' 'nointing with unction fine' - what's this 'nointing business? What is this 'nointing with unction fine?\". He goes on to show how \"a complicated set of forces\", among them sexual anguish, war and suffering, combined to release Owen from the spirit of his juvenilia - to distract him from \"poetry\": \"to make him say that he (of all people) was no longer concerned with it. And it was only when he was no longer concerned with it that he could be surprised, that he could be exalted by his gift.\" </p> <p>In the Blake Auden and James Auden lecture, Fenton also deals with the question of an artist's relation to uncompromising political or military strength, the expediency at first admiringly described, later altered, and finally repressed with the rest of that notorious poem \"Spain\": \"Today the deliberate increase in the chances of death; / The conscious acceptance of guilt in the necessary murder-\".</p> <p>That dutiful but sinister side of the Truly Strong Man was variously associated in Auden's work with spying, airmen, mountaineering, and journalism. As he writes with Isherwood in Journey to A War, \"a journalist has his duty like a soldier. It is sometimes necessary for him to go into danger\". </p> <p>As a foreign correspondent, Fenton himself has gone \"into danger\" (at the fall of Saigon, notably). He has also long been out of it, tending his garden, being a Professor of Poetry, and not writing very much verse. But what he has written is wonderful. Appropriately, Out of Danger was the title of his most recent book of poems. For my money it is one of the best collections of the past 20 years, dramatising the possibilities inherent in being distracted from poetry, and in other failures: \"When I was sure that I was strong. / I thought it was a medium / In which to grow, but I was wrong\" (\"The Possibility\"). </p> <p>But benefits came all the same, those of a man who in accepting his frivolity (some of the poems are like supercharged nursery rhymes) sounded greater depths, or those of a gardener who is surprised by the joy of a lap full of seed.</p>",

Much admired, winner of many prizes, stylistically over-influential, Ashbery has nonetheless provoked hostility and scepticism from uncomprehending readers. His poems slide through a variety of voices and styles with quickfire cuts between sensations, comments and events; sometimes the disruption of expectation is so frequent that it becomes easy for a sceptical or lazy reader to feel that the poems are nothing more than a random agglomeration of words, images, quotations and phrases. </p> <p>On a more sympathetic reading, what is sometimes perceived as a contempt for readers is arguably a generosity towards them. Ashbery, who frequently seems baffled, hurt or pissed off at the accusation that he does not communicate, once said: \"If my poetry is oblique, it's because I want to slant it at as wide an audience as possible, odd as it may come out in practice. Therefore, if I'm writing a love poem it won't talk about specifics, but just about the general feeling which anybody might conceivably be able to share.\" </p> <p>David Herd's fine study, John Ashbery and American Poetry, argues for this way of reading Ashbery while, valuably, sharing some of the entranced bafflement felt by Ashbery readers. In discussing \"Europe\", the most challenging poem in The Tennis Court Oath , Ashbery's most \"difficult\" book, Herd quotes the lines \"We are not loved more than now/ The newspaper is ruining your eyes\", drolly noting that: \"Addressing a cultural condition which it thought damag ing to the reader's wellbeing, [the poem] was serious when it suggested . . . that they were never 'loved more than now'. The trouble was it had a funny way of showing it.\" </p> <p>But an Ashbery poem, read at the right moment, in the right frame of mind (I like reading him on trains, and when I'm not too tired), can be an extraordinary thing: thought-provoking, mood-capturing, witty, political, camp, humane, inspirational. It is harder to say how the poetry works, and Herd's book starts from this very mixture of scepticism and sympathy, before placing Ashbery in various traditions and teasing out allusions, influences and developments. He discusses his early collaborations in the 1950s with the so-called New York School (a category that includes Frank O'Hara, Kenneth Koch and James Shuyler), and explains these writers' desire to escape the overbearing influence of Robert Lowell, and their enthusiastic participation in the avant-garde of their time. </p> <p>In doing so, he articulates with admirable clarity the dilemmas of any avant-garde art: the need to move on and away from tradition, and therefore to be difficult and unpopular, while still requiring a community of readers and critics to preserve and ultimately popularise the work as it comes into its own. The avant-garde artist strives for fresh ways of seeing in order to counter the homogenised, consumerist world offered by the media, while remaining wary of these fresh ways of seeing becoming merely another homogenised orthodoxy. As Ashbery himself wrote: \"Is there nothing then . . . between an avant-garde that has become a tradition and a tradition which is no longer one?\" </p> <p>Herd concentrates on Ashbery's idea that each poem arises out of, and includes, the occasion of its making. No detail is too grand or lowly, no style of speech too lofty or base, to be included. Everything is poeticised: the shared details of our social, economic and cultural lives freely mix, and through the poems we are persuaded to view them with fresh eyes. In this way, Ashbery's attention to every detail of existence is both generous and humble. It is political in the widest sense of the word - democratic, anti-consumerist, empowering. In Ashbery's poetry one frequently gets the sense of an alert citizen sharing his passion, stoicism, amusement or anger without ever hectoring or lecturing. It is a poetry of such radical scepticism that, while it can provoke as many readings as it has readers, none of them can remain settled or sustained across the oeuvre. More than anything, it is a poetry that gives readers room to think and feel for themselves. </p> <p>At the same time, Herd's erudition is enormously helpful in providing a framework for those responses. Pasternak has always been a declared influence; Herd carefully explains how and where this affects Ashbery's use of (often bizarre) metaphor and simile. Likewise, he takes us into \"Three Poems\" by teasing out its argument with Pascal and Auden. In tracing allusions and influences, as well as the political, personal and poetic contexts in which Ashbery produced his various volumes, Herd provides points of access for the reader. He does so with an enthusiasm and humour that courteously match his subject's own. </p> <p>Herd also makes much of the paradox of Ashbery's sudden success, when he wrote Self Portrait in a Convex Mirror and found himself transformed overnight from outsider into national institution. Ashbery himself has noted the danger that an artist can \"pass from unacceptability to acceptance without an intervening period of appreciation\", and his later career is thus plausibly seen by Herd as a constant negotiation towards further fresh starts. Ashbery's work, for himself and for everyone, is precisely about an attentiveness to one's own situation and potentiality, not a substitution of someone else's. Charmingly, in riposte to accusations of obscurity, Ashbery has stated that \"a poem that communicates something that's already known to a reader is not really communicating anything to him, and in fact shows a lack of respect\". Or, more strongly: \"It's a veiled insult to the reader.\" </p> <p>In this spirit, what Herd offers is not a reading of Ashbery but a way of reading Ashbery, and a critical language more appropriate to Ashbery's peculiarities than pre-packaged approaches, which merely make Ashbery reflect their own concerns. This is one of the most entertaining, lucid, witty, generous and hospitable works of criticism I have had the pleasure of reading. Like all good critics, Herd sends us back to the poems; prepared for the adventurous journey ahead, but not saddled with someone else's luggage.</p>",

He does so with an enthusiasm and humour that courteously match his subject's own. Herd also makes much of the paradox of Ashbery's sudden success, when he wrote Self Portrait in a Convex Mirror and found himself transformed overnight from outsider into national institution. Ashbery himself has noted the danger that an artist can \"pass from unacceptability to acceptance without an intervening period of appreciation\", and his later career is thus plausibly seen by Herd as a constant negotiation towards further fresh starts. Ashbery's work, for himself and for everyone, is precisely about an attentiveness to one's own situation and potentiality, not a substitution of someone else's. Charmingly, in riposte to accusations of obscurity, Ashbery has stated that \"a poem that communicates something that's already known to a reader is not really communicating anything to him, and in fact shows a lack of respect\". Or, more strongly: \"It's a veiled insult to the reader.\" In this spirit, what Herd offers is not a reading of Ashbery but a way of reading Ashbery, and a critical language more appropriate to Ashbery's peculiarities than pre-packaged approaches, which merely make Ashbery reflect their own concerns. This is one of the most entertaining, lucid, witty, generous and hospitable works of criticism I have had the pleasure of reading. Like all good critics, Herd sends us back to the poems; prepared for the adventurous journey ahead, but not saddled with someone else's luggage.",

Normally one wouldn't inflict this kind of situational exactitude on one's readers, but here amid the dank Norfolk fields - the reception took place at the University of East Anglia's Sainsbury Centre - could be witnessed a deeply symbolic event. The Poet Laureate was led smiling into the throng. At a table at the far end of the room were no fewer than four Booker winners. What was being celebrated, it became increasingly clear, was not merely the life of a distinguished ornament of the modern literary scene, but the triumph - or perhaps only the survival - of a particular brand of post-war English writing. </p> <p>This is not a complaint about Ishiguro, Swift, McEwan or Rushdie, the four Booker winners seen conferring over the buffet; simply an acknowledgment that in the reputation-brokering that has accompanied the progress of the British novel over the past 20 years, a certain kind of writing has lost out in favour of another. The kind that lost out, it is fair to say, was the melancholic-humorous novel of English decline, the novel of ironic glances backward, of suppressed diminuendos; the kind of book that Anthony Powell used to write, that A N Wilson still does, and of which Ferdinand Mount is an absolutely classic contemporary exponent. </p> <p>No consideration of Mount's Chronicle of Modern Twilight - a series of loosely linked novels (this is the fifth) going back as far as The Man Who Rode Ampersand (1975) - can altogether ignore the Powell connection. This is ancestral as well as stylistic: Powell, as it happens, was Mount's uncle by marriage. Gus Cotton, Mount's diffident civil-servant narrator, would hardly look out of place in A Dance to the Music of Time : he is a halting presence on the edge of things, a minute observer of human foibles, eager to please, always in search of an escape route when the emotional going gets tough. Mount specialises, too, in the unheralded reappearance: Dr Maintenon-Smith from the earlier novels, here found working on a fog-bound hospital ship, and Gerald Moonman, editor of the satirical magazine Frag (a dead ringer for Private Eye ), re-emerging to go off with his brother's wife. </p> <p>Essentially, Fairness is the story of an unrequited love affair, set against several decades of post-war English history. Blonde, intense Helen, whom Gus first encounters on a rain-swept Normandy beach in the early 1960s and whom he marks down as a repository for moral seriousness, turns out to be a talismanic figure in his life. Whether she is seen at her parents' home on \"Minnow Island\", downriver from Teddington, squired to a down-at-heel motorists' club off Regent Street by Bobs, Gerald's younger brother, or found working for a dodgy South African mining enterprise, Helen's capacity to hurt, mystify and intrigue is a constant. Eternally out of reach, capable of contracting the most bizarre alliances, half-confidential, half-aloof, Helen is the hinge on which the novel turns. She picks up the other characters - including Dido Wilmot, the outsized American businessman, and his predatory wife - but always manages to preserve herself intact amid a mounting tide of personal and historical wreckage. </p> <p>Gus and Helen's final encounter takes place at a child-abuse inquiry in the late 1980s, where he is the secretary and she a social-worker witness. However deviously plotted and neatly, or rather ambiguously, resolved - even the title contrives to marry a philosophical abstract with the name of the children's home - Fairness brings off many of its effects through sheer atmospherics. There is a characteristic moment when Gus makes one of his periodic visits to Bobs Moonman's gloomy flat, with its push-button lights and piles of uncollected post lying on the radi ator shelf. \"You felt that the dust rising from the brown stair-carpet was the same dust that had filled your mouth and nostrils a month before as you gasped for breath on the landing.\" </p> <p>Dust. Decay. Dereliction. This is not a world of bright futures, but of gently receding pasts. Mount's earlier novel The Clique (1978) - not part of the Chronicle series but capable of being read alongside it - was also like this; in fact, it was even more sharply figurative. Goater, its journalist hero, begins the book staking out the house of the \"Last Great Englishman\" (Winston Churchill) during his final illness, and later wanders through rows of East End terraces with names like \"Tel-El-Kebir\", \"Balaclava\" and \"Inkerman\". </p> <p>It would be a mistake, though, to write Mount off as yet another of those well-bred English elegists whose threnodies rise every so often to break the torpor of the right-wing newspapers. Where he excels, and where he has the edge over practically every one of his more effervescent contemporaries, is in his depiction of character. The unexpected reappearances, for example, are handled with a shrewd eye for physical detail. Re-encountering John Stilwell, the husband of a woman with whom he had an unsatisfactory fling years before in Normandy, Gus reflects: \"He didn't look older, but I was somehow more conscious of his physical presence, the tanned skin of his narrow cheeks and his dimity little chin, the bony fingers clasped round the handle of his square oxblood briefcase, the long black hairs on his skinny forearm . . .\" However eccentric or self-obsessed they are, one can believe in Mount's people. Once discovered, they are somehow at large in your consciousness in a way that many a postmodern wraith is not. </p> <p>There is no point in pretending that Fairness isn't a recognisably old-fashioned novel, or rather - a slightly different thing, perhaps - that it deals in some highly old-fashioned subject matter. A certain type of streetwise literary hipster will tell you that its manipulations of \"character\", its lives lived out in endless, brooding shadow, have simply been displaced by the post-1980s postmodern surge. And yet the reader will be struck, constantly and gratefully, by a spectacle that is now comparatively rare in fiction: the sight of ordinary people living in an ordinary - or not so ordinary - world.</p>",

Except for newcomer Camilla Gibb, who hovered nervously in the wings while Heinemann's Ravi Mirchandani praised her to the skies. Clearly unaware of the convention that a publisher's speech should not exceed in duration an author's reading, Mirchandani explained how the manuscript - plucked \"from an unknown Canadian publisher\" - had languished on his submissions pile for weeks on end.

More romping and less rowing, which might be the secret of its success - although not in America, where its blue content has sent distributors scurrying for cover. \u0095 And more cheer for Kureishi's publishers Faber, whose prot\u00e9g\u00e9s Victor Pelevin and Andrew O'Hagan feature on the \u00a375,000 Impac shortlist. Feel you cast your eyes over their work some time ago? You'd be right - the 2001 award focuses on global fiction published in 1999, a full year being just about long enough for the world's librarians to cast their votes. \u0095 The Loafer enjoyed a recent evening in the company of three Canadian writers, each of whom read obligingly from their new books after a few words from their publishers. Except for newcomer Camilla Gibb, who hovered nervously in the wings while Heinemann's Ravi Mirchandani praised her to the skies. Clearly unaware of the convention that a publisher's speech should not exceed in duration an author's reading, Mirchandani explained how the manuscript - plucked \"from an unknown Canadian publisher\" - had languished on his submissions pile for weeks on end. Doubtless, the Loafer thinks, while he was on a speech-writing course.",

I lie awake all night wondering if his hatred had built slowly over the weeks, or if it was a sudden mad falling head-over-heels in loathing. Get up after sleepless night to confront family and finances - always a ghastly cocktail. Never mind fading memories of Last Tango on Tobago. It's the rest of my life with this lot I have to sort out. Elaine and her child are still with us, though the waters have gone down around her Georgian rectory and some kind of decision is pending. She and Gordon have been having long serious talks in my absence, according to Harriet. About money. \"I can't remember what the leader of the Liberal Party is called!\" cries aunt suddenly in panic. \"I can't remember who the leader of the Liberal Party is !\" drawls Gordon. \"I know!\" I cry, \"It's Nigel Kennedy!\" Always distinguished by my general knowledge. Wonder if I could manage to get to sleep by counting the leaders of the Liberal Party jumping over a gate - or sitting on a fence. Distract aunt from her memory loss with photos of tropical birds. \"I want to show you my motmot, Auntie,\" I smile. Aunt is not listening, but scrabbling for an envelope in her bag. \"Just a minute, dearr , I wanted to ask you about the phone bill. I'm trying to work out a thirrrd of this.\" Aunt offers page of scribbled figures. Her ability to do sums is declining. \"You shouldn't be paying a third this quarter, Auntie. You've hardly used the phone at all.\" \"I should pay it!\" cries Elaine. \"All those calls to Tom! The bastard!\" She fights back tears. Who would have the heart to charge her a realistic rate for her phone calls, even if she had any money? Suddenly feel immensely tired and dull. Make secret plan to go back to bed and head for the door looking as if I have an important errand. \"Mum?\" Harriet grabs me. \"Can I talk to you about my A-levels? I've gotta choose them, like, now.\" \"Well, what do you want to do for a living?\" Harriet looks important. \"I wanna be an architect.\" Gobsmacked. \"An architect?

There are galanthus openings and meetings of a kind that is unheard of for crocuses. The reason for this is almost certainly that crocuses are moody; snowdrops are not. If the weather is not right for them, crocuses simply remain shut - and a closed crocus is no more enlivening than a closed golf umbrella, however bright that may be when fully expanded. However, when crocuses do open it means that the sun is shining and we ourselves can experience the same happiness, and the feeling that spring is finally with us.</p> <p>We feel expansive about crocuses. That is what I love about them, together with their great range of colours and markings, and the differences between the inside and outside of the flower. When seen together, the presentation is ideal. The gardening writer Ernest Bowles described them as his first garden love, and admitted that his raptures may appear the vapourings of a love-sick monomaniac (he was not far wrong).</p> <p>No bulb could be easier to grow, always provided you are not plagued by mice or voles. On my heavy soil, in which they find it hard to work, there is no problem. The corms (the globular stem base) multiply at a great rate, and many of them self-sow. By now, we are probably in the full tide of the Dutch hybrids, the largest kinds, which are purple, mauve, white or stripy. They are not refined, but they make a tremendous and gladdening show - and they self-sow like mad.</p> <p>When planting in turf, use a long-shafted bulb planter, if you possibly can, and take out individual plugs at irregular intervals, so that the planting looks relaxed and natural. Taking short cuts, there is a fashion for cutting a turf on three sides, turning it back as a flap and crowding corms in the rectangle underneath, then replacing the flap. This looks terrible; if you can persuade yourself otherwise, you can believe anything.</p> <p>Planting in turf is the ideal, as long as it isn't in self-conscious circles around a tree, as the mower will then reluctantly have to leave that area uncut for a few weeks to allow the crocus \"grass\" to finish its cycle, which won't be until as late as May. Planting in a meadow area among daffodils is also a good idea, because the crocuses flower before the daffodils are tall enough to spoil their display. I planted a few hundred Crocus tommasinianus 'Whitewell Purple' in our old orchard three years ago, and where there was originally one corm, there were up to eight or nine blooms this year. They are of a far richer colour than the plain species, too. 'Whitewell Purple' is, in fact, one of the most enthusiastic self-sowers, and it was already at its best last month.</p> <p>The Dutch yellow crocus is one of the most popular. It is an early flowerer, and Fergus likes it so well that he has marked some of the largest clumps with a view to dividing and spreading them around later this month. The point about this crocus is that it is sterile, and so cannot self-sow; one has to help it. This is the one that sparrows love to tear to shreds. Equally early and even more beautiful in its way is the species from which it derives, C. flavus (also C. aureus). It is smaller-flowered but of a richer shade of orange, and is a great self-seeder, though less widely offered. It combines and contrasts well with C. tommasinianus . These crocuses are good in borders, too, provided you don't get impatient with their lanky foliage after flowering. This foliage is narrow, and I don't find it unduly irritating for a few weeks. If you are not neurotic about their manurial regime, you can liven up your rose beds with crocuses in early spring. There won't be a trace of them left by the time the roses are ready to perform.</p> <p>Among the jolliest and most varied of the species is C. chrysanthus. It is naturally yellow, but varies tremendously thanks to selection. My favourite is 'Snow Bunting', which is creamy white with some dark stripes on the outside. It is deliciously scented and also one of the earliest. Unfortunately, a different cultivar is often sold under its name; whiter, but late-flowering and with no scent. So I was glad, at the February RHS show in Westminster, to see 'Snow Bunting' correctly named and identified. This species is so amazingly fertile that, after a few years of growing one next to another, you will find that they have given birth to some really exciting variants, with subtle combinations of mauve and yellow. It is difficult not to feel proud of one's offspring.</p> <p>At this time of the year, the easiest autumn-flowering species to colonise - C. speciosus and C. nudiflorus in my case - are making carpets of their \"grass\". They have no leaves when flowering, but become green in late winter. And they have this colonising, carpeting habit. Spring flowerers will not thrive among them. If you want to increase the range of your autumn flowerers, lift them in the next few weeks, while you can still see where they are. In a meadow setting, this is particularly easy while the turf is still short and tight.</p> <p>The regime to follow in such cases is to give the grass its first and main cut in July or August, after its contents have scattered their seed; then to await the flowering of colchicums and autumn crocuses, complete by the end of October; after which the turf can be cut again, tight as you can get it, so as to set off the short-stemmed snowdrops and crocuses to best effect</p>",

La Passion Rouge 1999 (14 points, on the same price deal) is a charming, dry party wine that works well chilled and served with fish. Nottage Hill Cabernet Sauvignon/Shiraz 1999 (16.5 points, on offer for \u00a34.49 until March 18) has tannins and subtle spiciness. Nottage Hill Chardonnay 1999 (16 points, down to \u00a33.99) is classic Aussie chardonnay, though at that Morrisons price, perhaps its true score should be 16.75. Inycon Chardonnay 1999, from Sicily (16 points, down to \u00a33.99), offers delicious, unfussy, unwoody fruit of depth, texture and style, and is classy and stylish on the finish. It is also available at Sainsbury's, Safeway, Waitrose and the Co-Op, where it is more likely to be \u00a34.99. Di Notte Pinot Grigio 1999 (14 points, offered at \u00a32.99) has some moving, if hardly seismic, apricot sensations.</p> <p>Sainsbury's also has some bottles that are worth the detour. La Palmeria Merlot Gran Reserva 1999 (17.5 points, \u00a37.99), from Chile, shows a magnificent structure: towering, richly elegant and soft as taffeta, with bright, corduroy patches of tannin and a superb complexity that finishes with such style it takes one's breath away. It's in limited distribution at Sainsbury's (call 0800 636262 for details), and can also be found at Oddbins. Errazuriz Wild Ferment Chardonnay 1999 (17 points, \u00a38.99) is also Chilean and, with its hint of vegetality and very lingering, creamy woodiness, is like a wild Meursault.

Also, the latest vintage of Chteau La Vieille Cure Fronsac 1997 (16.5 points, \u00a310.99) has arrived, and it's in good form - this is good-value claret, offering stylish cedarwood and tobacco fruit with fine-grained tannins, and is so much more charming than many more much higher priced, and allegedly finer, bordeaux reds.</p> <p>Sainsbury's has a couple of interesting three-litre wine boxes, too. Kumala Chardonnay (16.5 points, \u00a314.99), from South Africa, throbs with purpose and plump melon tones, a touch of pear and pineapple, and a subtle undertone of baked fruit. If this sounds a bit of a mouthful, however, it is nothing compared with Banrock Station Mataro Shiraz (15 points, on offer at \u00a312.99 until March 17), which is tarrily rich, jammy, thick and hugely food friendly.

If this sounds a bit of a mouthful, however, it is nothing compared with Banrock Station Mataro Shiraz (15 points, on offer at \u00a312.99 until March 17), which is tarrily rich, jammy, thick and hugely food friendly. At 54p a glass, it makes for bargain, throat-rippling tippling. \u0095 For the latest wine news, and to email Malcolm Gluck, visit www.superplonk.com",

However, in the Rome of the ancient Romans and earlier, before the lemon was introduced to Europe, another ingredient, sumac, was used to sour and alter foods that may have been too sweet or too salty. Even today in Arab cooking, sumac is still preferred to lemon in many instances, as its effect is less astringent although, in truth, the flavours are very different.</p> <p>Sumac is made from a berry grown high in the mountains of Sicily, from where it is exported mostly to Lebanon, though it is used also in Iran, Turkey and Iraq. It normally makes an appearance as a bowl of gorgeous red powder served on the table to be sprinkled on kebabs, though it also features in zaatar, a marvellous mixture of sumac and wild thyme that is dusted over fried eggs. (Your best bet for getting hold of sumac in this country is to head for your nearest Asian or Middle Eastern grocer.)</p> <p>This week's other spice (although, in reality, a seed) is sesame, a regular feature in the food of southeast Asia. But it, too, is famed for its use in Middle Eastern cookery, most notably in hoummos, in the form of tahini, a paste of sesame seeds. It may seem odd to include among the recipes a dish that is so simple to make and already well-known, but I wonder how many people eat or make their own. In comparison with the real McCoy, shop-bought varieties are like grouting for tiles.</p> <p>All recipes serve six.</p> <p><b> HOUMMOS BI-TAHINI </b><br> Considering the many variations of hoummos (most of them appalling) that take up as much shelf space in a supermarket as butter, it is amazing that we retain such a deep fondness for this dish. Proper hoummos is made only of chickpeas, tahini, garlic, lemon juice and olive oil. As usual, the classic simple approach cannot be bettered, so leave all fancy variations well alone. The hoummos at Alwaha in Westbourne Grove, London, is a great treat: it has the smoothest texture I have ever eaten. This is achieved by soaking and then peeling the chickpeas before cooking - and even I wouldn't suggest going that far.</p> <p>200g dried chickpeas <br> 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda <br> 200ml tahini <br> 2 lemons, juiced <br> 3 cloves garlic, crushed <br> Paprika <br> Extra-virgin olive oil</p> <p>It is vital to soak the chickpeas for 24 hours prior to cooking. Place them in plenty of cold water, add the bicarb, and leave to soak. Next day, rinse the chickpeas under cold water, place them in a deep saucepan and cover them again with water. Bring the pot to a boil, reduce the heat to a rapid simmer and cook until very tender. This should take one to two hours, depending on the age of the chickpeas. Place a colander over a deep bowl and drain the cooked chickpeas, reserving the liquor.</p> <p>Place the chickpeas in a food processor and render to the smoothest of pastes. Place the pur\u00e9e in a bowl and stir in the tahini. Add the lemon juice spoonful by spoonful until it is sour enough for your taste, then add the garlic. Add a little of the liquor if the mixture becomes too stiff.</p> <p>The Lebanese serve hoummos by spreading it over an oval dish before giving it a dusting of paprika and pouring over a little olive oil.</p> <p><b> FATTOOSH</b><br> This salad really merits the search for sumac. It is quite brilliant whether eaten just as it is, or stuffed into warm bread or jazzed up and served with a roast fish. It is also a template for the quality and quantity of herbs and greens we should use in salads. It is essential that all the herbs and leaves are thoroughly washed and dried before chopping them with a heavy, sharp knife. It would be an injustice to these fine ingredients were one to put them in the food processor, which will bash and bruise, rather than chop them fine. <br></p> <p>6 little gem lettuces <br> 12 spring onions <br> 5 mini (ie, Lebanese) cucumbers <br> 5 firm, red tomatoes <br> 2 handfuls flat-leaf parsley, picked <br> 150g fresh mint <br> 150g purslane (use extra parsley if this is unavailable)</p> <p>To dress</p> <p>4-5 tbsp sumac <br> Sea salt <br> 9 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil <br> Good pitta bread</p> <p>Remove any blemished outer leaves from the lettuces, then shred them with a sharp knife.

Coarsely chop the herbs. Put all these ingredients in a bowl, then strew with sumac, a little salt and the olive oil. Toast the pittas, and break them into the salad. Stir well to dress thoroughly, then serve.</p> <p><b> A STUFFING FOR VEGETABLES</b><br> Where the reputation of hoummos seems unsullied, the fate of the once ubiquitous stuffed vegetable seems beyond repair. This stuffing is pure Lebanese, and quite delicious - it works especially well with vine leaves, courgettes, aubergines and peppers.</p> <p>210g paella rice (or arborio) <br> 450g ripe tomatoes, chopped <br> 1 bunch spring onions, chopped <br> 1 big handful flat-leaf parsley, chopped <br> 1 small handful fresh mint, chopped <br> 3 heaped tbsp sumac <br> tsp ground cinnamon <br> 1 level tsp ground allspice <br> 1 level tsp milled black pepper <br> Sea salt <br> 2-3 tbsp fresh lemon juice <br> 150ml olive oil <br> 3-4 ripe tomatoes, sliced</p> <p>Wash the rice in two or three changes of cold water and drain. Put in a pan with plenty of water, bring to a boil and cook for three to four minutes. Thoroughly rinse and drain the rice, then put it in a mixing bowl, along with all the chopped tomato, onion and herbs, sumac, cinnamon, allspice, pepper and salt to taste. Pour in the lemon juice and olive oil, and adjust the seasoning as necessary.</p> <p>Choose a vegetable to stuff, say red peppers. Cut the top off the peppers, and spoon out all the seeds and white pith. Fill the peppers three-quarters full - this gives the rice space to expand - and pop the pepper lids back on top. Arrange the tomato slices in the bottom of a shallow casserole, and sit the peppers on top.</p> <p>Fill the dish with cold water to come 2cm or so from the lip, then cover and bring up to a boil. Reduce the heat, and leave to simmer for 45 minutes or so. Check the stuffing to ensure the rice is cooked, remove the pot from the heat, and leave to sit for 10 minutes. Carefully lift out the peppers. If the liquor in the pot is still thin, simmer it down until it is a sauce-like consistency. Pour this gravy into a bowl and serve with the peppers</p> <p><b> PERSIAN CUBED LAMB KEBABS </b><br> Aka Tikkeh Kabab. While I was putting together this week's dishes, it quickly became apparent, quite by accident, how very retro these recipes seemed. Kebabs may not feature in our cooking as often as they once did, but they remain inexpensive, simple to prepare, straightforward to cook and truly delicious to eat. This recipe is from The Legendary Cuisine Of Persia, by Margaret Shaida (Grub Street, \u00a314.99), and is brilliant in its economy. Traditionally, these would be served at the Feast of the Sacrifice, and the fillet of a lamb freshly slaughtered in one's own courtyard by a professional butcher would be used. However, this might be pushing it a bit in Blighty. Needless to say, any lean cut of lamb will do very well. The recipe for saffron liquid and the rice may seem laborious and even of another era, but the result is so very good and unusual that it is well worth the effort.</p> <p>500g boned lamb (leg, shoulder or neck fillet), cut into small cubes <br> 2 medium onions <br> 2 lemons, juiced <br> Sea salt <br> Pepper</p> <p>For the basting sauce</p> <p>60g butter <br> 1 lemon, juiced <br> tsp liquid saffron <br> 1 small bowl suma</p> <p>To make the liquid saffron, grind 30 stamens of saffron to a powder in a pestle and mortar, or with the back of a spoon, and mix with five teaspoons of boiling water. It will keep for several weeks in a sealed jar in the fridge.</p> <p>Wash the lamb in cold water, then rinse and dry. Peel and grate the onions and put into a bowl, along with the lemon juice, some sea salt and freshly milled black pepper. Coat the lamb with the marinade, put it in a bowl, cover, and refrigerate overnight.</p> <p>Thread skewers with the meat and lay these on a plate. Melt the butter, and mix in the lemon juice and liquid saffron. Start cooking the kebabs - you can either grill them over coals (always the best way to cook such dishes), or pop them under the grill or in a ridged pan - basting regularly with the sauce, until they are deeply coloured all over and a blush of pink remains in the meat.</p> <p>Serve with a bowl of sumac, to allow guests to help themselves.</p> <p><b> RICE WITH HERBS </b> <br> Aka Sabzi Polow.</p> <p>500g basmati rice <br> Salt <br> 100ml vegetable oil <br> 4 tsp liquid saffron <br> 60g clarified unsalted butter <br> 350g fresh herbs, made up of equal measures parsley, coriander, dill and chives <br> 1 generous pinch dried fenugreek <br> 1 clove garlic</p> <p>Pick over the rice, discarding any impurities, and wash it four or five times in cold water. Let the rice sit, covered in cold water with two tablespoons of salt, for two hours or so.</p> <p>Pick, clean and dry the herbs. Chop them fine with the fenugreek and garlic. Fill a large pan of water, add two tablespoons of rice, and bring to the boil. Spoon out the rice, then tip the rest of the rice into the water and boil for two to three minutes. Drain in a colander, rinse lightly in cold water and then toss to loosen all the grains.</p> <p>This next stage requires a bold streak and a nod from God. Place the pot over a high heat, add the oil and, with care, two or three tablespoons of water. Heat until sizzling then remove from heat. Spread a layer of rice over the base of the pan, strew this with herbs and repeat thus, building up a conical mound, ending with a layer of rice. With the handle of a wooden spoon, make three holes in the mound, pushing it right through to the bottom of the pan. Thoroughly seal the lid, place the pot over a high heat for three minutes, then reduce the heat to very low and leave to steam gently for around 30 minutes or so.</p> <p>Once cooked, the rice can be left to sit off the heat, lid on and undisturbed, for a good half an hour longer. Before serving, spoon over the liquid saffron and butter, add a little salt to taste and, with a fork in each hand, lightly mix the rice.

      "body": "<p>There comes a time when you fancy spending some money on real art. The trouble is, you've never bought a painting or print before. Sure, there have been a few posters, even a rather nice copy of Picasso's dove from the local bookshop, but an original piece of contemporary art? Now that's different - it's an intimidating world, and you have little idea where to start.</p> <p>So, you set off for the nearest gallery. You stand on the street peering in at the paintings and lithographs, then try the door but can't get in. You notice the sign near the bell: \"Viewing by appointment only\". Back to your posters and bookshop prints you go.</p> <p>Or do you? Not if you are determined because, although the closed-door gallery is the best-known face of the serious art market, it is by no means the only place to buy original, high-quality art. Why, you can even find great things on the high street.</p> <p>Emma Underhill is arts coordinator at Habitat, one of the people responsible for the store's contemporary art programme. This, she says, is designed \"to endorse our commitment to making good art and design part of everyday life\". There are two parts to the programme. The larger one is the print collection, which is basically a set of posters, but instead of the standard fare of sunflowers and cornfields, it offers contemporary images from both established names such as Richard Caldicott and Zaha Hadid, and rising Brit Art stars such as Emma Hatch. Prices range from \u00a35 to \u00a325.</p> <p>The other part of the programme focuses on original pieces, primarily by emerging artists. Underhill finds many of these at MA degree shows, which are ideal places to discover new, affordable work. From time to time, a chosen artist is given an exhibition space in a store in London (King's Road or Tottenham Court Road), Glasgow or Dublin, and shoppers get the chance to see contemporary art in a familiar environment.</p> <p>Prices are fair - a large-scale painting by a relative unknown can go for between \u00a31,000 and \u00a33,000, which, by art-market standards, isn't a lot. And, while you may not have heard of the artist, he or she could be destined for stardom. In the past five years, Habitat has exhibited Tracey Emin and Gary Hume, whose work sells for the kind of sums that make an outlay of, say, \u00a31,500 seem like pocket money.</p> <p>It's not only Habitat buyers who can seek out new talent in Britain's studios and art schools: ordinary punters can do it, too. The thing to remember, as print-maker and lecturer Nick Devison points out, is that artists want to sell their work. \"MA students are desperate to sell,\" he says. \"Very often they are in debt and at the very least they want someone to come and see their show.\"</p> <p>Finding these sale-hungry new artists isn't that difficult. All major cities have an MA course in painting or print-making: <a href=\"http://www.ucas.ac.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.ucas.ac.uk</a>, the website for the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service, lists the address, email and phone numbers of every institution in the country. There is also a handbook for those who prefer printed pages to screens (see information panel on page 45).</p> <p>Armed with this information, you can find out when the shows are, turn up, and, bingo, you could be the owner of a piece by a future winner of the Turner prize. It won't cost you much, either - a small print can be picked up for as little as \u00a375. A painting will always be more, however, because it's a one-off; similarly, a mono print will cost more than an edition, and a print from a large edition will be a little cheaper than one from a small edition (see glossary).</p> <p>It's surprisingly easy to track down working artists in their studios, too. The noticeboard at the local civic art gallery should have details of exhibitions in your area. And AN, the artists' newsletter, lists studios across the country which in turn can provide details of \"open studio\" events where the public can meet artists and buy their work.</p> <p>Once you get into a studio, the secret of success is not to be intimidated. Devison, himself a practising artist, says that, far from having to come out with arty terminology, all you need to do is be friendly and open. \"Artists,\" he says, \"are often deeply complimented that people want to buy their work. If someone says, 'I absolutely love your work', then the artist's ego has gone through the roof and you can start to negotiate a price.\"</p> <p>So, how do you spot a piece with investment potential? The short answer is you can't. Buying art as an investment is a different business entirely; the average punter buying for their home should buy on the basis of taste alone. That said, there are ways of ensuring that your print or painting is unlikely to lose its value. Devison recommends buying from an older (ie, 30-plus) artist because if he or she is still making art at this age, then they are likely to continue doing so. (This is why MA shows are a better bet than BA shows.)</p> <p>He also suggests buying from someone who has exhibited before, because a successful artist will never sell for less than at the last exhibition.</p> <p>Gallery owner Mark Wilson, on the other hand, advises first-timers to go for an established name. \"You should never buy something you don't like,\" he says. \"You must like it even if the price goes through the floor, but I would advise anyone starting out to go for a bankable name - after all, if you buy a \u00a32,000 sofa, you could always sleep on it if you lose your house, but you can't sleep on a painting.\"</p> <p>True, but doesn't a bankable name mean serious money and one of those intimidating, closed-door galleries? No - at least not if you are online.

      "bodyText": "There comes a time when you fancy spending some money on real art. The trouble is, you've never bought a painting or print before. Sure, there have been a few posters, even a rather nice copy of Picasso's dove from the local bookshop, but an original piece of contemporary art? Now that's different - it's an intimidating world, and you have little idea where to start. So, you set off for the nearest gallery. You stand on the street peering in at the paintings and lithographs, then try the door but can't get in. You notice the sign near the bell: \"Viewing by appointment only\". Back to your posters and bookshop prints you go. Or do you? Not if you are determined because, although the closed-door gallery is the best-known face of the serious art market, it is by no means the only place to buy original, high-quality art. Why, you can even find great things on the high street. Emma Underhill is arts coordinator at Habitat, one of the people responsible for the store's contemporary art programme. This, she says, is designed \"to endorse our commitment to making good art and design part of everyday life\". There are two parts to the programme. The larger one is the print collection, which is basically a set of posters, but instead of the standard fare of sunflowers and cornfields, it offers contemporary images from both established names such as Richard Caldicott and Zaha Hadid, and rising Brit Art stars such as Emma Hatch. Prices range from \u00a35 to \u00a325. The other part of the programme focuses on original pieces, primarily by emerging artists. Underhill finds many of these at MA degree shows, which are ideal places to discover new, affordable work. From time to time, a chosen artist is given an exhibition space in a store in London (King's Road or Tottenham Court Road), Glasgow or Dublin, and shoppers get the chance to see contemporary art in a familiar environment. Prices are fair - a large-scale painting by a relative unknown can go for between \u00a31,000 and \u00a33,000, which, by art-market standards, isn't a lot. And, while you may not have heard of the artist, he or she could be destined for stardom. In the past five years, Habitat has exhibited Tracey Emin and Gary Hume, whose work sells for the kind of sums that make an outlay of, say, \u00a31,500 seem like pocket money. It's not only Habitat buyers who can seek out new talent in Britain's studios and art schools: ordinary punters can do it, too. The thing to remember, as print-maker and lecturer Nick Devison points out, is that artists want to sell their work. \"MA students are desperate to sell,\" he says. \"Very often they are in debt and at the very least they want someone to come and see their show.\" Finding these sale-hungry new artists isn't that difficult. All major cities have an MA course in painting or print-making: www.ucas.ac.uk, the website for the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service, lists the address, email and phone numbers of every institution in the country. There is also a handbook for those who prefer printed pages to screens (see information panel on page 45). Armed with this information, you can find out when the shows are, turn up, and, bingo, you could be the owner of a piece by a future winner of the Turner prize. It won't cost you much, either - a small print can be picked up for as little as \u00a375. A painting will always be more, however, because it's a one-off; similarly, a mono print will cost more than an edition, and a print from a large edition will be a little cheaper than one from a small edition (see glossary). It's surprisingly easy to track down working artists in their studios, too. The noticeboard at the local civic art gallery should have details of exhibitions in your area. And AN, the artists' newsletter, lists studios across the country which in turn can provide details of \"open studio\" events where the public can meet artists and buy their work. Once you get into a studio, the secret of success is not to be intimidated. Devison, himself a practising artist, says that, far from having to come out with arty terminology, all you need to do is be friendly and open. \"Artists,\" he says, \"are often deeply complimented that people want to buy their work. If someone says, 'I absolutely love your work', then the artist's ego has gone through the roof and you can start to negotiate a price.\" So, how do you spot a piece with investment potential? The short answer is you can't. Buying art as an investment is a different business entirely; the average punter buying for their home should buy on the basis of taste alone. That said, there are ways of ensuring that your print or painting is unlikely to lose its value. Devison recommends buying from an older (ie, 30-plus) artist because if he or she is still making art at this age, then they are likely to continue doing so. (This is why MA shows are a better bet than BA shows.) He also suggests buying from someone who has exhibited before, because a successful artist will never sell for less than at the last exhibition. Gallery owner Mark Wilson, on the other hand, advises first-timers to go for an established name. \"You should never buy something you don't like,\" he says. \"You must like it even if the price goes through the floor, but I would advise anyone starting out to go for a bankable name - after all, if you buy a \u00a32,000 sofa, you could always sleep on it if you lose your house, but you can't sleep on a painting.\" True, but doesn't a bankable name mean serious money and one of those intimidating, closed-door galleries? No - at least not if you are online. Nearly three years ago, Wilson set up www.artforsale.co.uk as an adjunct to his bricks-and-mortar gallery in north London. \"Everyone was beginning to talk about the internet,\" he explains, \"and a friend built the site as an experiment.\" The experiment paid off; Wilson now has about 500 virtual visitors a day, a number he could never have dreamed of when he relied solely on feet-through-the-door. And there are many advantages for the cyber buyer. Obviously it is convenient and unthreatening - no danger of a snooty gallery assistant sniggering over your terminology here - but it also gives you the chance to look at work in a way you never could do in a gallery. You can search by price (up to \u00a3500, \u00a3500-\u00a3999, \u00a31,000-\u00a34,999, \u00a35,000 upwards) which is always embarrassing face to face if you have a limited budget; by medium (oil on canvas, screen print, etching, etc); by artist; or you can choose to view the entire range of work for sale (about 242 pictures in total).

Obviously, a Riley isn't going to be cheap, but the chances are that if you buy it online it will be a little bit less than in a smart city-centre gallery because there's no ground rent in cyberspace.

As he speaks, he holds a Hindu prayer leaflet tenderly in his hands - it was a present from his mother, and is the only possession he has left from his childhood. He always carries it with him, and sleeps with it under his pillow.</p> <p>One afternoon 18 months ago, he returned home from school in his village to find neighbours gathered around his door. They tried to stop him going into the house, warning him that the army was looking for him and would kill him. \"They told me to run for my life,\" he says, \"but I forced my way in.\" What he saw returns to him in flashbacks. His mother was dead - she had been shot - his elder sister had been raped and shot, and his 18-month-old sister strangled. He's not sure who murdered them, but his father, under threat of death to himself and his family, had been made to drive a truck for the Tamil Tigers. The night before the rest of his family was butchered, Kannan's father died when his truck was blown up. The family didn't know that as they sat up all night waiting for him.</p> <p>\"People in the community took me and my seven-year-old sister, who had also been at school that day, secretly in a boat to a faraway jungle area where we would be safe,\" says Kannan. He made a hut with leaves, and traders from stalls along a lonely highway gave him food. Four months later, his sister got typhoid and, with no access to medical help, he had no choice but to watch her die. The highway traders helped him cremate her. Kannan finds it almost unbearable to talk of his sister and tries not to weep as a panel member from the Refugee Council, the main charity assisting refugees, translates for him. He says it is thanks to her he has not gone mad.</p> <p>The Tamil Tigers found him, threatened to kill him, tied his hands and bundled him into a truck. They shaved his head and his eyebrows, so that if he tried to run away he would be easily recognisable, then trained him and forced him into battle. Young boys were used on the front line to protect the more experienced fighters. Kannan was wounded and sent to the capital, Colombo, to distribute propaganda and do what he calls \"risky jobs\". In desperation, he decided to go on the run in search of some distant relatives, who he thought lived a few miles away. He ran a long way under cover of night until he reached their home. His relatives kept him hidden from the Tigers, and arranged for him to be flown to safety by one of the agents operating travel scams and supplying false papers for refugees, selling some of their land to meet the agent's fee.</p> <p>Kannan's journey was terrifying. After a 15-hour flight, landing he had no idea where, he was handed over to two white men. \"They locked me in a room with bread and water for three days and threatened me,\" he says. \"I was crying, I feared the future.\" On the third night, they took him to a deserted car park and ordered him to get into a dark container. Playing for time, he said he was thirsty. \"They gave me Coca-Cola, then I felt strange and passed out.\" He had been drugged and came round many hours later, crammed into a barely ventilated steel box. Hearing the murmur of voices, he struggled out to find the four other Tamils. They talked about running away, but since they had no idea where they were, this idea seemed futile. It was then that they were helpfully told they were in Japan. They spent that first night in the UK in jail; the next day some relatives came to meet the others. Kannan was taken to foster carers, who were kind but did not speak Tamil, and he wandered around their house weeping inconsolably.</p> <p>Since then, Kannan has been well cared for by social services and has now been taken in by Tamils, but he doesn't want to reveal where he lives because, he says, the Tigers are everywhere. He had been here for 10 months when I met him, but he wasn't yet in school. He was frightened to go out, venturing no further than a local temple. \"I am grateful to those who have taken me in, grateful to this country for accommodating me,\" he says. He speaks softly, as though fearing the sound of his own voice.</p> <p>A phrase people working with such children often use is that they don't have a voice. In the case of Tamara, a 15-year-old from eastern Europe, this was literally true: when she arrived in the UK in November 1997, she was mute. But, because she was with her sister, who was 18, she was deemed to be accompanied by an adult. Both had been tortured, both were traumatised.</p> <p>On their first night in the UK, the sisters stayed in a transit lounge. \"It was very cold; they gave us a chocolate biscuit,\" Tamara remembers. The next day, they were taken to a hostel that was full of male drug addicts and alcoholics. Tamara couldn't leave their room alone, and when she did so with her sister, they encountered the clientele, sometimes semi-clothed, usually out of their heads, hanging about on the staircase and landings. On one occasion, a man exposed himself to her. \"Sometimes they came into our room asking for tea and sugar, they were lurching, we were very frightened.\" The first time she went outside, a man kerb-crawled them. The hostel was in a suburban red light area. Local authority officials classified Tamara as not alone; on the other hand, she and her sister did not qualify as a family, eligible for other accommodation.</p> <p>Tamara had the good fortune to be referred to principal child and adolescent psychotherapist Sheila Melzak at the Medical Foundation for the Victims of Torture. At first, she would curl up in Melzak's office and cry. She wanted to die. It was 10 months before she spoke, having previously communicated through drawings and poems expressing suicidal feelings. She has come through, learned English, flourished at school, and is now doing well at college. Had it not been for the voluntary agencies who helped her, among them the Medical Foundation, it is questionable whether she would have survived at all.</p> <p>Melzak sees children from all over the world who have been tortured, bereaved, abandoned. They come from places of conflict and poverty, sent here by parents, family or friends who scrape up agents' fees to spirit them away from life-threatening situations. They come from Iraq, Sri Lanka, Angola, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Kosovo, Sierra Leone. They are children first, refugees second, but the authorities in the UK, says Melzak, do not recognise that. \"These children's vulnerability is compounded by their experience of violence. They come from cultures in whichthey would not be expected to live alone, they would live at home until they get married. And yet there is an assumption, by the authorities in the UK, that because they get here alone, they are capable of independent living. That is simply not the case.\"</p> <p>Earlier this year, the Audit Commission reported that \"it is routine for some boroughs to place new arrivals in unsupported temporary accommodation - 41% of unaccompanied children in the care of London boroughs (at October 1999) were housed in bed-and-breakfast accommodation, hotels or hotel annexes, including some children aged 15 or under\".</p> <p>It is not only lone refugee children who are put in B&amp;Bs; indigenous children are, too, according to both the Department of Health and the Association of Local Government(ALG). ALG says, \"It is all part of a very carefully worked out, detailed process. This is the same for all children, regardless of where they were born.\" Really?</p> <p>Responsibility for the care of refugee children arriving alone - known either as unaccompanied minors or separated children - lies with social services departments. The children are covered, as are UK-born children, by the Children Act - under Section 20 or Section 17. Under Section 20, a child is deemed to be \"looked after\", and the local authority has a \"duty to safeguard and promote the safety of the child\". The child is fostered or accommodated in a children's home, and kept track of after their 18th birthday. When necessary, this can be extended into young adulthood.</p> <p>But the 3,350 separated children who arrived in the UK last year will mostly be dealt with under Section 17, which, for many of them, means empty days and lonely nights in B&amp;B hotels with little or no back-up from overstretched social services departments.</p> <p>Social services funding for these unaccompanied children comes from the Department of Health. The Guardian put the question of whether B&amp;B accommodation is suitable for such children to John Hutton, health minister with responsibility for social care. His reply was, \"We do recognise that some councils find it difficult to find suitable placements.\"</p> <p>Authorities in receipt of government top-up grants for refugees get \u00a3500 a week for children up to 16 and \u00a3300 post-16. The costs of looking after indigenous children in similar circumstances are often more than double that amount. In 1999/2000, the estimated national shortfall between expenditure and the grant was \u00a33m, leaving the local authorities with the task of topping up the top-up grants.</p> <p>As a result of these limitations, once they reach 18, these young people are truly on their own. The first time I visited her at the Medical Foundation, Melzak was on the phone to a local authority asylum worker. They were talking about a distressed refugee who, having turned 18, was no longer classified a child, despite his problems. \"My client has been put in a room near a railway line,\" Melzak said to a voice down the line. \"He cannot sleep because he was tortured, he has terrible nightmares. Why did you move him from the hostel where he had settled in?\" She paused, staring at the ceiling as though it might give her patience. \"He was happy there - yes, I know he turned 18, yes, I know you have given him another room, but that is also right beside a railway line.\"</p> <p>The client in question, a gentle, willowy boy, arrived here from a Middle Eastern country where, aged 16, he had been imprisoned for two months, during which time he was frequently beaten while being interrogated about his family's politics. His father was in jail and his mother in hiding. An uncle spirited him out of the country. His first months in the UK were very strange, but he liked the people running the central London hostel where he was living, and at least he was getting \u00a335 worth of vouchers per week.</p> <p>Those were the good old days. When he turned 18, he was told to leave the hostel and offered first one and then another room by the railway line. Every 10 days or so, the landlord delivered a consignment of frozen food - sausage in gravy, fish cakes, chips, peas - and sliced bread. He had neither cash nor vouchers. \"I feel safe for the life,\" he told Melzak, \"but not for the peace of mind.\" He has now been allotted a room away from the railway, and is once more receiving vouchers.</p> <p>The local authority in question just happens to have been Lambeth, but could just as easily have been one of any number in the UK, says Melzak. None of the 95 or so unaccompanied 16-17-year-olds in Lambeth's care is on Section 20, a spokesman explained.</p> <p>Melzak says that the way these children are dealt with by social services is \"utterly random\". Kieran Breen, assistant programme director of Save the Children Fund, agrees: \"It's an idiosyncratic jigsaw of ad hoc practice; how they are treated depends who's on duty and where a child comes in. It's down to individual social workers even within boroughs, and that determines the outcome. It's not just refugees who get bad delivery of services, it's abused children generally. The choice between sections 17 and 20 of the Children Act has become a national lottery.\" Only one borough in the UK, West Sussex social services, automatically takes separated children under Section 20, the \"cared for\" category of the Children Act.</p> <p>It's hard to imagine what the soulless acres of airport transit corridors and lounges look like to a terrified solitary child inching towards the immigration desk, waiting in line with a beating heart. Some wander around before being noticed by a cleaner or, perhaps, by airport surveillance. Olu arrived in the UK at 14, clutching one small bag. She had never been out of Nigeria before, she had never been on a plane and she had certainly never walked alone through the grey zones of airport transit. It was an arrival that compounded the fears she hoped she had left behind.</p> <p>Haltingly, Olu tells the fragmented story of her childhood. The trouble began when her father was forced to join some kind of cult. \"Before you join, you have to make a sacrifice, they take part of your body and eat it,\" she says. He was murdered - she remembers when her family found his body. \"He was in a mortuary, his head split in two. We embalmed him and took him home to bury him, but the cult went to his grave and took part of his body.\" The cult - perhaps a criminal gang, perhaps a rival tribe - came back. They raped Olu, her sisters and her mother. Wherever they fled, their attackers pursued them, and so the family split up in order to survive. Olu went on the run, sleeping rough for three nights until she found a friend of her father's, who gave her an air ticket and a forged passport. He told her not to tell immigration her real age, but to try and seem older. It was a bad mistake.</p> <p>She was frightened on the plane, and cold, because she had no coat. \"I felt as if everybody was looking at me,\" she says. She had been told that an \"auntie\" would meet her at Heathrow, identifiable by a sign with Olu's name written on it.</p> <p>When she got to the end of her nervous walk through the grey zones, she stood in line until she got to the immigration desk. An officer asked her where she was going, she replied that she was going to meet her auntie. Her bag was searched, and she was taken to what she describes as an \"alcove\" by two female officials who strip searched her. She was then left in a waiting room and, at around 2am, informed that she would be searched again, and led to a room where she was told to take off her clothes. A female doctor was present and Olu was x-rayed for drugs they suspected she was carrying internally. Then she was given a green robe and the doctor examined her, including, she says, giving her an internal vaginal examination. \"I was crying,\" she says. \"So was one of the lady officers.\" Olu was told that this was routine procedure for drug suspects. She says that she was not interviewed or asked any relevant questions before the search began, and that she did not tell them she was only 14, as the man in Nigeria had told her not to.</p> <p>The day after her examination, she says she was interviewed, which was when she revealed her real age. An immigration officer at Gatwick told me that only she and one other at the airport had any special training for dealing with unaccompanied refugee children.</p> <p>Olu was taken from the airport to Campsfield House, a detention centre for refugees near Oxford. The Refugee Council has an agreement with the immigration service that it will notify them of unaccompanied minors. In Olu's case, this contact was not made for about four weeks, and she spent six weeks in total at Campsfield, feeling suicidal, before the Refugee Council and social services managed to get her out. She then went to live with a foster family, of whom she speaks very warmly, and is now living happily in a shared flat.</p> <p>A list of questions was sent by the Guardian to Barbara Roche, the minister in charge of immigration for the Home Office, and to John Hutton, at the Department of Health. A spokesperson answered unequivocally on Roche's behalf: \"Unaccompanied children are never detained in prisons.\" But in July last year, Roche said, \"Unaccompanied children should never be detained other than in the most exceptional circumstances, and then only overnight with appropriate care if they, for example, arrive alone at an airport.\" However, Terry Smith, head of the children's section of the Refugee Council, says that their records for the past five years show that they had 210 children referred to them, who claimed to be under 18, and who had been held in detention, some of them as young as 14. And, according to an Amnesty International report published in May 1999, between January 1997 and June 1998, 76 unaccompanied refugee children had been detained, \"some in young offenders institutions and even in adult prisons\". Amnesty cited one case of a 14-year-old Nigerian girl held in Holloway.</p> <p>During a very brief telephone interview with Roche, when this apparent contradiction was put to her, she indicated that she would like to see the Amnesty data. The same questions about detention were put to Hutton, who replied, \"We have no evidence that children are being held in detention, and would welcome any further details so that this can be looked into.\"</p> <p>Even more sinister than the detentions is the unknown number of child refugees disappearing in suspicious circumstances. West Sussex social services, the area that covers Gatwick Airport, is among the best in the country in relation to its treatment of separated children. Yet a total of 71 child asylum seekers - the majority of them girls from poor Nigerian families - disappeared from its care between October 1995 and December 2000.</p> <p>So far, only two of the missing children have been found, and nobody knows the fate of the others. Police conclude that most have been taken by traffickers for prostitution, forced domestic labour and crime, a trade worth an estimated $7bn globally. Prosecution of traffickers is difficult, because of the absence of anti-trafficking laws in the UK and most of Europe, and because the young people - the witnesses - are too scared to pass on information, let alone testify. Many have been threatened that their families will die if anything is revealed. So far, no trafficker has been successfully prosecuted in this country.</p> <p>Detective Superintendent David Gaylor has worked on the West Sussex cases. \"We feel neutered and disempowered,\" he says. \"We have struggled to influence anyone at a high enough level to make a difference and nobody is looking at the potential scale of it. Initially, when we raised some specific issues with the Home Office in 1999, they replied in so many words that it wasn't their problem, that social services shouldn't lose these people. We have since then had some response from Barbara Roche, but there's still a long way to go. I hope the Home Office will now strive for European and international liaison, because one small police force and social services department in the south of England isn't going to change the price of fish on their own. I am sorry to say it may be one of those cases where not enough notice will be taken until there is a death and then social services will get the blame. We are saying don't wait for that tragedy.\"</p> <p>Suspicion of asylum seekers and refugees is often fuelled by xenophobic comments by politicians and public figures, and it is underpinned by a high level of ignorance. A recent Mori poll found that many respondents believed that refugees received \u00a3113 a week - the truth is, they get around \u00a335 in vouchers, to be used at specific shops; they believed that 20% of the current UK population is made up of immigrants - the figure is 4%; they thought 27% of the population belonged to an ethnic minority - the figure is 7%.</p> <p>The Sun made its position absolutely clear: \"It's awful that any youngster feels desperate enough to leave his or her home... but... sentiment leads to detriment for British-born children.\"</p> <p>Hopefully, the 20-year-old Afghan in Birmingham with whom I spoke didn't see that particular comment, or the headline \"Ungrateful Afghans are welcome - to go home\". A quietly spoken, achingly polite young man, he fled from the Taliban aged 16 and, on a long, dangerous journey, got lost in a remote region of the Commonwealth of Independent States; he is too frightened to say where. Arrested because he had no travel documents, he was thrown into jail. Jail was a narrow room with 44 other people, almost all adult men - \"Criminals, Mafiosos, rapists, killers,\" he says. They slept in rotas because there were only bunks for 20. They were all stripped to their underpants. He witnessed the gang rape of the only other teenager. The young Afghan had never told anyone this story before, but wants people to know the depths of cruelty to which separated children are subject. Ungrateful? No, he's very grateful. Go home? He would love to, but he would be killed.</p> <p>The problem for Tony, a 19-year-old Kosovan, is that the home where he might once have returned was ransacked after his family was forced to flee to a refugee camp in Macedonia. Someone else has moved into the family's flat - going \"home\" would involve a bitter and dangerous conflict. Tony arrived in the UK on May 5, 1998. He was just 17.</p> <p>He was smuggled out of the country by an agent to whom Tony's father had paid the higher going rate of about \u00a32,500, because the cheaper rate, about half that amount, gives no guarantees of survival. Tony has now settled, has a flat and has done well in his first year at university studying computer science. His mother and 12-year-old sister joined him recently, his father having died of a heart attack brought on by the stress of the war. When it looked as if the family would be dispersed under current UK policy, Tony went to war. In his only lapse from fluent English, he said, \"I fought like a lion and bored their heads!\" It didn't go down well with the local authority - asylum seekers are expected to be grateful for any crumbs they receive - but it worked. With help from Nick Hardwick, director of the Refugee Council, Tony and his family are now settled together.</p> <p>Under the 1951 UN Refugee Convention, the UK is obliged to grant protection to children, as well as to adults, who are at risk of persecution in their own country due to race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership of a social group. Under the UN Convention against Torture, the UK cannot return anyone to a country where they might suffer torture or ill-treatment. However, the UK entered reservations to clauses of the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, refusing to be bound, as Amnesty International put it, \"to ensure that a refugee child receives appropriate protection and humanitarian assistance in the enjoyment of its rights\".</p> <p>Separated children are seven times less likely to receive refugee status than those in their 20s. Most of those granted it can prove they will suffer political persecution if forced to return. Even so, children are rarely, if ever deported, or \"removed\", to use a Home Office euphemism. But it does happen, accordingto a Refugee Council panel member, in cases where the asylum seeker's age is disputed. So how do officials determine whether someone is giving the right date of birth? \"There's no special training given for this,\" explains an asylum screening unit spokesman, \"so, in an age dispute, if an officer is challenged, a supervisor is called. It comes down to the view of the person interviewing with the supervisor checking.\" Checking, says a Refugee Council panel member, consists of staring.</p> <p>One young man who has been through the removal procedure is Inka Oshodi, originally from Surinam. Oshodi, now 20, has been here for nine years. More than three years ago, he applied for asylum. When he was 11, Oshodi's parents brought him to the UK, leaving him temporarily with an aunt. His parents were killed in a car crash shortly afterwards, and his aunt threw him out. He left, aged 12, with nothing but the clothes he wore, and wandered around Brixton unnoticed, save by a man who offered him drugs. He slept on the street. Like someone from a fairytale, the next day a young man took Oshodi home to his mother who, having overcome her initial shock, took the child in. Oshodi spent the next four years with the family, who treated him like a son, working in their shop, but never attending school.</p> <p>Impenetrable bureaucracies prevented Oshodi's new family from securing him any documents, however. So when, at 16, he met some older people hanging out in Trafalgar Square who said they could get him a passport, he gave them his earnings. Unknown to him, they used the passport to open a bank account that was used fraudulently. Oshodi was arrested, but the charges were dropped immediately. He was nevertheless taken to Campsfield House as an illegal immigrant. During the three months he spent there, he turned 17, and soon after two attempts were made to \"remove\" him.</p> <p>The first time he was taken to Gatwick and told he was going to Nigeria. \"I said, 'I've never been to Nigeria! I'm not from Nigeria, I'm not going there!'\" They escorted him to a plane. \"They tried to put me in a seat,\" he says, \"I said, 'I want to see the pilot,' I was very upset and threw the tea trolley. The pilot said, 'I'm not taking that boy.' He asked me where I was from and I said Surinam. Meanwhile, the security guys were trying to force me into the seat. I fought them and then I had an asthma attack and ended up in hospital.\" He spent three days in the hospital wing of another detention centre. They tried once again to \"remove\" him. \"The immigration officers said I was going to Surinam. I said there was nobody there to receive me, the law says there has to be someone checked out by the authorities here to meet a minor being deported.\"</p> <p>This time, when asked for his passport by an airline official before embarkation, he replied he didn't have one, whereupon she refused to allow him on the plane.</p> <p>Oshodi was returned to Campsfield and eventually, with help from the Refugee Council, his lawyer and social worker, he got out. Enrolled at an FE college since 1997, he is currently doing A-levels and aims to go to university. This country is Oshodi's home - he has lived here almost as long as he lived in Surinam. His immigration status was finally resolved as we went to press; it took five years. It was still unresolved when he bravely spoke at a Labour party fringe meeting organised by young separated child refugees, backed by several charities. Labour MP Tom Levitt, parliamentary private secretary to Barbara Roche, sat on the panel as Oshodi and three others gave stirring accounts of their experiences.</p> <p>After Oshodi spoke, Trevor Phillips, chairman of the Greater London Authority, said passionately, \"We need to rock the boat... Our policies have gone off the rails because they are driven by political imperatives from somewhere else. We know the way we treat refugees is not decent, not fair, not right. We've got to get honest here, and I'm right off-message already. Vouchers, for example, send all the wrong messages. Nobody who aspires to Labour values could tolerate it in our society, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong.\"</p> <p>In his speech, Levitt rattled through the immigration problems that New Labour \"inherited\" from the Tories, before turning to the question of beggars. He complained of people begging on the tube with babies \"drugged up to the eyeballs on Calpol\". He praised the National Asylum Seekers Service (Nass) and landlords from whom accommodation was being rented. He added, \"Vouchers protect asylum seekers against exploitation from protection rackets and the shops are training their staff so there are no unfortunate incidents, and if there are, I want to know about them.\"</p> <p>The Home Office recently set up a working group on the question of unaccompanied asylum seeking children. In a letter - seen by the Guardian - which was sent to working group guests at the end of December last year, Kathy Casey of the Asylum Appeals Policy Directorate, wrote of new approaches to policy, costs and processes which would produce \"fair outcomes for individuals\".</p> <p>Casey went on to say that new directives include suggestions that asylum applicants only be accepted if they can produce evidence of their age or if \"their appearance clearly supports the age claimed\". How does an immigration officer establish age in a young person of a culture about which he or she knows very little? These children arrive either with forged documents or no documents - how can they \"provide evidence\" of their ages?</p> <p>Casey's list of aims continues with plans to \"eliminate the incentives which attract unaccompanied children\", and \"reduce the potential growth in spending\". In order to prevent them from settling once they are here, Casey suggests that \"where there is no prospect of safe return, exceptional leave to remain may be granted to unaccompanied children for four years or until their 18th birthday\".</p> <p>It becomes clear why these children are almost never granted refugee status - at 18 anyone can be deported, under 18 there are nigh on impossible protective measures which have to be met before a child can be returned. Casey writes that the Home Office seeks \"to enforce the removal of the unaccompanied asylum seeking children who have been refused asylum and who have no other basis to stay in the UK when they reach 18\".</p> <p>The odds are so stacked against these young people that their determination, dignity and pride in the face of obstruction are very impressive. All whom I met were studying or, like Kannan, struggling to get into school, a vital element if a child is to feel included in any society. And yet, according to the Refugee Council, 1,400 asylum-seeking children have no school places. Many come from stable, loving families, and when the impact of trauma is mediated by good experiences before and after the trauma, says Sheila Melzak, their chances of achieving peace of mind are increased.</p> <p>Arturo Correia and Joshua Salo are two who have experienced trauma and violence, but have found help since. Correia, an Angolan, was 14 in 1994 when bombs started falling as he sat in his classroom. He never went home again and knows nothing of his family's fate. He was flown to a Red Cross camp in Luanda with his brother and the other kids from their school. He and his brother were befriended by a Frenchman who worked for an aid agency. He got them passports, air tickets to the UK and gave them $600. The $600 was stolen before they reached the UK. \"We asked the cabin crew where to go when the plane landed, but they couldn't help us,\" says Correia. \"Luckily, someone took us to a Red Cross lady who spoke Portuguese.\" It was she who interviewed them.</p> <p>Correia and his brother were taken to a foster family, who were very kind, and whose teenage children managed to communicate with</p>",

      "bodyText": "'If we are in politics for one thing - it is to make sure that all children are given the best chance in life.' Tony Blair, 1999 Labour party conference Why would any child abandon family, home, country? Why go into exile? What child would choose dispossession? Amazingly, there are 100,000 children living separated from their parents in Europe, children who have escaped from war, torture, bombs and mines. Do we do right by these children when they arrive in the UK alone - as they do in increasing numbers? What kind of a welcome do they get? Kannan was 13 when he arrived in the UK from Sri Lanka. Dumped in a British port at dawn after a long and terrifying journey, he emerged from a container truck wondering where he was. Four other Tamils had been in the container, too, all shoved into metal boxes. One of them managed to ask a man in uniform where they were. He replied, \"Japan, mate - where do you think?\" Then Kannan saw a Union Jack and worked it out. His eyes are too haunted, too dark for a 14-year-old. As he speaks, he holds a Hindu prayer leaflet tenderly in his hands - it was a present from his mother, and is the only possession he has left from his childhood. He always carries it with him, and sleeps with it under his pillow. One afternoon 18 months ago, he returned home from school in his village to find neighbours gathered around his door. They tried to stop him going into the house, warning him that the army was looking for him and would kill him. \"They told me to run for my life,\" he says, \"but I forced my way in.\" What he saw returns to him in flashbacks. His mother was dead - she had been shot - his elder sister had been raped and shot, and his 18-month-old sister strangled. He's not sure who murdered them, but his father, under threat of death to himself and his family, had been made to drive a truck for the Tamil Tigers. The night before the rest of his family was butchered, Kannan's father died when his truck was blown up. The family didn't know that as they sat up all night waiting for him. \"People in the community took me and my seven-year-old sister, who had also been at school that day, secretly in a boat to a faraway jungle area where we would be safe,\" says Kannan. He made a hut with leaves, and traders from stalls along a lonely highway gave him food. Four months later, his sister got typhoid and, with no access to medical help, he had no choice but to watch her die. The highway traders helped him cremate her. Kannan finds it almost unbearable to talk of his sister and tries not to weep as a panel member from the Refugee Council, the main charity assisting refugees, translates for him. He says it is thanks to her he has not gone mad. The Tamil Tigers found him, threatened to kill him, tied his hands and bundled him into a truck. They shaved his head and his eyebrows, so that if he tried to run away he would be easily recognisable, then trained him and forced him into battle. Young boys were used on the front line to protect the more experienced fighters. Kannan was wounded and sent to the capital, Colombo, to distribute propaganda and do what he calls \"risky jobs\". In desperation, he decided to go on the run in search of some distant relatives, who he thought lived a few miles away. He ran a long way under cover of night until he reached their home. His relatives kept him hidden from the Tigers, and arranged for him to be flown to safety by one of the agents operating travel scams and supplying false papers for refugees, selling some of their land to meet the agent's fee. Kannan's journey was terrifying. After a 15-hour flight, landing he had no idea where, he was handed over to two white men. \"They locked me in a room with bread and water for three days and threatened me,\" he says. \"I was crying, I feared the future.\" On the third night, they took him to a deserted car park and ordered him to get into a dark container. Playing for time, he said he was thirsty. \"They gave me Coca-Cola, then I felt strange and passed out.\" He had been drugged and came round many hours later, crammed into a barely ventilated steel box. Hearing the murmur of voices, he struggled out to find the four other Tamils. They talked about running away, but since they had no idea where they were, this idea seemed futile. It was then that they were helpfully told they were in Japan. They spent that first night in the UK in jail; the next day some relatives came to meet the others. Kannan was taken to foster carers, who were kind but did not speak Tamil, and he wandered around their house weeping inconsolably. Since then, Kannan has been well cared for by social services and has now been taken in by Tamils, but he doesn't want to reveal where he lives because, he says, the Tigers are everywhere. He had been here for 10 months when I met him, but he wasn't yet in school. He was frightened to go out, venturing no further than a local temple. \"I am grateful to those who have taken me in, grateful to this country for accommodating me,\" he says. He speaks softly, as though fearing the sound of his own voice. A phrase people working with such children often use is that they don't have a voice. In the case of Tamara, a 15-year-old from eastern Europe, this was literally true: when she arrived in the UK in November 1997, she was mute. But, because she was with her sister, who was 18, she was deemed to be accompanied by an adult. Both had been tortured, both were traumatised. On their first night in the UK, the sisters stayed in a transit lounge. \"It was very cold; they gave us a chocolate biscuit,\" Tamara remembers. The next day, they were taken to a hostel that was full of male drug addicts and alcoholics. Tamara couldn't leave their room alone, and when she did so with her sister, they encountered the clientele, sometimes semi-clothed, usually out of their heads, hanging about on the staircase and landings. On one occasion, a man exposed himself to her. \"Sometimes they came into our room asking for tea and sugar, they were lurching, we were very frightened.\" The first time she went outside, a man kerb-crawled them. The hostel was in a suburban red light area. Local authority officials classified Tamara as not alone; on the other hand, she and her sister did not qualify as a family, eligible for other accommodation. Tamara had the good fortune to be referred to principal child and adolescent psychotherapist Sheila Melzak at the Medical Foundation for the Victims of Torture. At first, she would curl up in Melzak's office and cry. She wanted to die. It was 10 months before she spoke, having previously communicated through drawings and poems expressing suicidal feelings. She has come through, learned English, flourished at school, and is now doing well at college. Had it not been for the voluntary agencies who helped her, among them the Medical Foundation, it is questionable whether she would have survived at all. Melzak sees children from all over the world who have been tortured, bereaved, abandoned. They come from places of conflict and poverty, sent here by parents, family or friends who scrape up agents' fees to spirit them away from life-threatening situations. They come from Iraq, Sri Lanka, Angola, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Kosovo, Sierra Leone. They are children first, refugees second, but the authorities in the UK, says Melzak, do not recognise that. \"These children's vulnerability is compounded by their experience of violence. They come from cultures in whichthey would not be expected to live alone, they would live at home until they get married. And yet there is an assumption, by the authorities in the UK, that because they get here alone, they are capable of independent living. That is simply not the case.\" Earlier this year, the Audit Commission reported that \"it is routine for some boroughs to place new arrivals in unsupported temporary accommodation - 41% of unaccompanied children in the care of London boroughs (at October 1999) were housed in bed-and-breakfast accommodation, hotels or hotel annexes, including some children aged 15 or under\". It is not only lone refugee children who are put in B&amp;Bs; indigenous children are, too, according to both the Department of Health and the Association of Local Government(ALG). ALG says, \"It is all part of a very carefully worked out, detailed process. This is the same for all children, regardless of where they were born.\" Really? Responsibility for the care of refugee children arriving alone - known either as unaccompanied minors or separated children - lies with social services departments. The children are covered, as are UK-born children, by the Children Act - under Section 20 or Section 17. Under Section 20, a child is deemed to be \"looked after\", and the local authority has a \"duty to safeguard and promote the safety of the child\". The child is fostered or accommodated in a children's home, and kept track of after their 18th birthday. When necessary, this can be extended into young adulthood. But the 3,350 separated children who arrived in the UK last year will mostly be dealt with under Section 17, which, for many of them, means empty days and lonely nights in B&amp;B hotels with little or no back-up from overstretched social services departments. Social services funding for these unaccompanied children comes from the Department of Health. The Guardian put the question of whether B&amp;B accommodation is suitable for such children to John Hutton, health minister with responsibility for social care. His reply was, \"We do recognise that some councils find it difficult to find suitable placements.\" Authorities in receipt of government top-up grants for refugees get \u00a3500 a week for children up to 16 and \u00a3300 post-16. The costs of looking after indigenous children in similar circumstances are often more than double that amount. In 1999/2000, the estimated national shortfall between expenditure and the grant was \u00a33m, leaving the local authorities with the task of topping up the top-up grants. As a result of these limitations, once they reach 18, these young people are truly on their own. The first time I visited her at the Medical Foundation, Melzak was on the phone to a local authority asylum worker. They were talking about a distressed refugee who, having turned 18, was no longer classified a child, despite his problems. \"My client has been put in a room near a railway line,\" Melzak said to a voice down the line. \"He cannot sleep because he was tortured, he has terrible nightmares. Why did you move him from the hostel where he had settled in?\" She paused, staring at the ceiling as though it might give her patience. \"He was happy there - yes, I know he turned 18, yes, I know you have given him another room, but that is also right beside a railway line.\" The client in question, a gentle, willowy boy, arrived here from a Middle Eastern country where, aged 16, he had been imprisoned for two months, during which time he was frequently beaten while being interrogated about his family's politics. His father was in jail and his mother in hiding. An uncle spirited him out of the country. His first months in the UK were very strange, but he liked the people running the central London hostel where he was living, and at least he was getting \u00a335 worth of vouchers per week. Those were the good old days. When he turned 18, he was told to leave the hostel and offered first one and then another room by the railway line. Every 10 days or so, the landlord delivered a consignment of frozen food - sausage in gravy, fish cakes, chips, peas - and sliced bread. He had neither cash nor vouchers. \"I feel safe for the life,\" he told Melzak, \"but not for the peace of mind.\" He has now been allotted a room away from the railway, and is once more receiving vouchers. The local authority in question just happens to have been Lambeth, but could just as easily have been one of any number in the UK, says Melzak. None of the 95 or so unaccompanied 16-17-year-olds in Lambeth's care is on Section 20, a spokesman explained. Melzak says that the way these children are dealt with by social services is \"utterly random\". Kieran Breen, assistant programme director of Save the Children Fund, agrees: \"It's an idiosyncratic jigsaw of ad hoc practice; how they are treated depends who's on duty and where a child comes in. It's down to individual social workers even within boroughs, and that determines the outcome. It's not just refugees who get bad delivery of services, it's abused children generally. The choice between sections 17 and 20 of the Children Act has become a national lottery.\" Only one borough in the UK, West Sussex social services, automatically takes separated children under Section 20, the \"cared for\" category of the Children Act. It's hard to imagine what the soulless acres of airport transit corridors and lounges look like to a terrified solitary child inching towards the immigration desk, waiting in line with a beating heart. Some wander around before being noticed by a cleaner or, perhaps, by airport surveillance. Olu arrived in the UK at 14, clutching one small bag. She had never been out of Nigeria before, she had never been on a plane and she had certainly never walked alone through the grey zones of airport transit. It was an arrival that compounded the fears she hoped she had left behind. Haltingly, Olu tells the fragmented story of her childhood. The trouble began when her father was forced to join some kind of cult. \"Before you join, you have to make a sacrifice, they take part of your body and eat it,\" she says. He was murdered - she remembers when her family found his body. \"He was in a mortuary, his head split in two. We embalmed him and took him home to bury him, but the cult went to his grave and took part of his body.\" The cult - perhaps a criminal gang, perhaps a rival tribe - came back. They raped Olu, her sisters and her mother. Wherever they fled, their attackers pursued them, and so the family split up in order to survive. Olu went on the run, sleeping rough for three nights until she found a friend of her father's, who gave her an air ticket and a forged passport. He told her not to tell immigration her real age, but to try and seem older. It was a bad mistake. She was frightened on the plane, and cold, because she had no coat. \"I felt as if everybody was looking at me,\" she says. She had been told that an \"auntie\" would meet her at Heathrow, identifiable by a sign with Olu's name written on it. When she got to the end of her nervous walk through the grey zones, she stood in line until she got to the immigration desk. An officer asked her where she was going, she replied that she was going to meet her auntie. Her bag was searched, and she was taken to what she describes as an \"alcove\" by two female officials who strip searched her. She was then left in a waiting room and, at around 2am, informed that she would be searched again, and led to a room where she was told to take off her clothes. A female doctor was present and Olu was x-rayed for drugs they suspected she was carrying internally. Then she was given a green robe and the doctor examined her, including, she says, giving her an internal vaginal examination. \"I was crying,\" she says. \"So was one of the lady officers.\" Olu was told that this was routine procedure for drug suspects. She says that she was not interviewed or asked any relevant questions before the search began, and that she did not tell them she was only 14, as the man in Nigeria had told her not to. The day after her examination, she says she was interviewed, which was when she revealed her real age. An immigration officer at Gatwick told me that only she and one other at the airport had any special training for dealing with unaccompanied refugee children. Olu was taken from the airport to Campsfield House, a detention centre for refugees near Oxford. The Refugee Council has an agreement with the immigration service that it will notify them of unaccompanied minors. In Olu's case, this contact was not made for about four weeks, and she spent six weeks in total at Campsfield, feeling suicidal, before the Refugee Council and social services managed to get her out. She then went to live with a foster family, of whom she speaks very warmly, and is now living happily in a shared flat. A list of questions was sent by the Guardian to Barbara Roche, the minister in charge of immigration for the Home Office, and to John Hutton, at the Department of Health. A spokesperson answered unequivocally on Roche's behalf: \"Unaccompanied children are never detained in prisons.\" But in July last year, Roche said, \"Unaccompanied children should never be detained other than in the most exceptional circumstances, and then only overnight with appropriate care if they, for example, arrive alone at an airport.\" However, Terry Smith, head of the children's section of the Refugee Council, says that their records for the past five years show that they had 210 children referred to them, who claimed to be under 18, and who had been held in detention, some of them as young as 14. And, according to an Amnesty International report published in May 1999, between January 1997 and June 1998, 76 unaccompanied refugee children had been detained, \"some in young offenders institutions and even in adult prisons\". Amnesty cited one case of a 14-year-old Nigerian girl held in Holloway. During a very brief telephone interview with Roche, when this apparent contradiction was put to her, she indicated that she would like to see the Amnesty data. The same questions about detention were put to Hutton, who replied, \"We have no evidence that children are being held in detention, and would welcome any further details so that this can be looked into.\" Even more sinister than the detentions is the unknown number of child refugees disappearing in suspicious circumstances. West Sussex social services, the area that covers Gatwick Airport, is among the best in the country in relation to its treatment of separated children. Yet a total of 71 child asylum seekers - the majority of them girls from poor Nigerian families - disappeared from its care between October 1995 and December 2000. So far, only two of the missing children have been found, and nobody knows the fate of the others. Police conclude that most have been taken by traffickers for prostitution, forced domestic labour and crime, a trade worth an estimated $7bn globally. Prosecution of traffickers is difficult, because of the absence of anti-trafficking laws in the UK and most of Europe, and because the young people - the witnesses - are too scared to pass on information, let alone testify. Many have been threatened that their families will die if anything is revealed. So far, no trafficker has been successfully prosecuted in this country. Detective Superintendent David Gaylor has worked on the West Sussex cases. \"We feel neutered and disempowered,\" he says. \"We have struggled to influence anyone at a high enough level to make a difference and nobody is looking at the potential scale of it. Initially, when we raised some specific issues with the Home Office in 1999, they replied in so many words that it wasn't their problem, that social services shouldn't lose these people. We have since then had some response from Barbara Roche, but there's still a long way to go. I hope the Home Office will now strive for European and international liaison, because one small police force and social services department in the south of England isn't going to change the price of fish on their own. I am sorry to say it may be one of those cases where not enough notice will be taken until there is a death and then social services will get the blame. We are saying don't wait for that tragedy.\" Suspicion of asylum seekers and refugees is often fuelled by xenophobic comments by politicians and public figures, and it is underpinned by a high level of ignorance. A recent Mori poll found that many respondents believed that refugees received \u00a3113 a week - the truth is, they get around \u00a335 in vouchers, to be used at specific shops; they believed that 20% of the current UK population is made up of immigrants - the figure is 4%; they thought 27% of the population belonged to an ethnic minority - the figure is 7%. The Sun made its position absolutely clear: \"It's awful that any youngster feels desperate enough to leave his or her home... but... sentiment leads to detriment for British-born children.\" Hopefully, the 20-year-old Afghan in Birmingham with whom I spoke didn't see that particular comment, or the headline \"Ungrateful Afghans are welcome - to go home\". A quietly spoken, achingly polite young man, he fled from the Taliban aged 16 and, on a long, dangerous journey, got lost in a remote region of the Commonwealth of Independent States; he is too frightened to say where. Arrested because he had no travel documents, he was thrown into jail. Jail was a narrow room with 44 other people, almost all adult men - \"Criminals, Mafiosos, rapists, killers,\" he says. They slept in rotas because there were only bunks for 20. They were all stripped to their underpants. He witnessed the gang rape of the only other teenager. The young Afghan had never told anyone this story before, but wants people to know the depths of cruelty to which separated children are subject. Ungrateful? No, he's very grateful. Go home? He would love to, but he would be killed. The problem for Tony, a 19-year-old Kosovan, is that the home where he might once have returned was ransacked after his family was forced to flee to a refugee camp in Macedonia. Someone else has moved into the family's flat - going \"home\" would involve a bitter and dangerous conflict. Tony arrived in the UK on May 5, 1998. He was just 17. He was smuggled out of the country by an agent to whom Tony's father had paid the higher going rate of about \u00a32,500, because the cheaper rate, about half that amount, gives no guarantees of survival. Tony has now settled, has a flat and has done well in his first year at university studying computer science. His mother and 12-year-old sister joined him recently, his father having died of a heart attack brought on by the stress of the war. When it looked as if the family would be dispersed under current UK policy, Tony went to war. In his only lapse from fluent English, he said, \"I fought like a lion and bored their heads!\" It didn't go down well with the local authority - asylum seekers are expected to be grateful for any crumbs they receive - but it worked. With help from Nick Hardwick, director of the Refugee Council, Tony and his family are now settled together. Under the 1951 UN Refugee Convention, the UK is obliged to grant protection to children, as well as to adults, who are at risk of persecution in their own country due to race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership of a social group. Under the UN Convention against Torture, the UK cannot return anyone to a country where they might suffer torture or ill-treatment. However, the UK entered reservations to clauses of the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, refusing to be bound, as Amnesty International put it, \"to ensure that a refugee child receives appropriate protection and humanitarian assistance in the enjoyment of its rights\". Separated children are seven times less likely to receive refugee status than those in their 20s. Most of those granted it can prove they will suffer political persecution if forced to return. Even so, children are rarely, if ever deported, or \"removed\", to use a Home Office euphemism. But it does happen, accordingto a Refugee Council panel member, in cases where the asylum seeker's age is disputed. So how do officials determine whether someone is giving the right date of birth? \"There's no special training given for this,\" explains an asylum screening unit spokesman, \"so, in an age dispute, if an officer is challenged, a supervisor is called. It comes down to the view of the person interviewing with the supervisor checking.\" Checking, says a Refugee Council panel member, consists of staring. One young man who has been through the removal procedure is Inka Oshodi, originally from Surinam. Oshodi, now 20, has been here for nine years. More than three years ago, he applied for asylum. When he was 11, Oshodi's parents brought him to the UK, leaving him temporarily with an aunt. His parents were killed in a car crash shortly afterwards, and his aunt threw him out. He left, aged 12, with nothing but the clothes he wore, and wandered around Brixton unnoticed, save by a man who offered him drugs. He slept on the street. Like someone from a fairytale, the next day a young man took Oshodi home to his mother who, having overcome her initial shock, took the child in. Oshodi spent the next four years with the family, who treated him like a son, working in their shop, but never attending school. Impenetrable bureaucracies prevented Oshodi's new family from securing him any documents, however. So when, at 16, he met some older people hanging out in Trafalgar Square who said they could get him a passport, he gave them his earnings. Unknown to him, they used the passport to open a bank account that was used fraudulently. Oshodi was arrested, but the charges were dropped immediately. He was nevertheless taken to Campsfield House as an illegal immigrant. During the three months he spent there, he turned 17, and soon after two attempts were made to \"remove\" him. The first time he was taken to Gatwick and told he was going to Nigeria. \"I said, 'I've never been to Nigeria! I'm not from Nigeria, I'm not going there!'\" They escorted him to a plane. \"They tried to put me in a seat,\" he says, \"I said, 'I want to see the pilot,' I was very upset and threw the tea trolley. The pilot said, 'I'm not taking that boy.' He asked me where I was from and I said Surinam. Meanwhile, the security guys were trying to force me into the seat. I fought them and then I had an asthma attack and ended up in hospital.\" He spent three days in the hospital wing of another detention centre. They tried once again to \"remove\" him. \"The immigration officers said I was going to Surinam. I said there was nobody there to receive me, the law says there has to be someone checked out by the authorities here to meet a minor being deported.\" This time, when asked for his passport by an airline official before embarkation, he replied he didn't have one, whereupon she refused to allow him on the plane. Oshodi was returned to Campsfield and eventually, with help from the Refugee Council, his lawyer and social worker, he got out. Enrolled at an FE college since 1997, he is currently doing A-levels and aims to go to university. This country is Oshodi's home - he has lived here almost as long as he lived in Surinam. His immigration status was finally resolved as we went to press; it took five years. It was still unresolved when he bravely spoke at a Labour party fringe meeting organised by young separated child refugees, backed by several charities. Labour MP Tom Levitt, parliamentary private secretary to Barbara Roche, sat on the panel as Oshodi and three others gave stirring accounts of their experiences. After Oshodi spoke, Trevor Phillips, chairman of the Greater London Authority, said passionately, \"We need to rock the boat... Our policies have gone off the rails because they are driven by political imperatives from somewhere else. We know the way we treat refugees is not decent, not fair, not right. We've got to get honest here, and I'm right off-message already. Vouchers, for example, send all the wrong messages. Nobody who aspires to Labour values could tolerate it in our society, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong.\" In his speech, Levitt rattled through the immigration problems that New Labour \"inherited\" from the Tories, before turning to the question of beggars. He complained of people begging on the tube with babies \"drugged up to the eyeballs on Calpol\". He praised the National Asylum Seekers Service (Nass) and landlords from whom accommodation was being rented. He added, \"Vouchers protect asylum seekers against exploitation from protection rackets and the shops are training their staff so there are no unfortunate incidents, and if there are, I want to know about them.\" The Home Office recently set up a working group on the question of unaccompanied asylum seeking children. In a letter - seen by the Guardian - which was sent to working group guests at the end of December last year, Kathy Casey of the Asylum Appeals Policy Directorate, wrote of new approaches to policy, costs and processes which would produce \"fair outcomes for individuals\". Casey went on to say that new directives include suggestions that asylum applicants only be accepted if they can produce evidence of their age or if \"their appearance clearly supports the age claimed\". How does an immigration officer establish age in a young person of a culture about which he or she knows very little? These children arrive either with forged documents or no documents - how can they \"provide evidence\" of their ages? Casey's list of aims continues with plans to \"eliminate the incentives which attract unaccompanied children\", and \"reduce the potential growth in spending\". In order to prevent them from settling once they are here, Casey suggests that \"where there is no prospect of safe return, exceptional leave to remain may be granted to unaccompanied children for four years or until their 18th birthday\". It becomes clear why these children are almost never granted refugee status - at 18 anyone can be deported, under 18 there are nigh on impossible protective measures which have to be met before a child can be returned. Casey writes that the Home Office seeks \"to enforce the removal of the unaccompanied asylum seeking children who have been refused asylum and who have no other basis to stay in the UK when they reach 18\". The odds are so stacked against these young people that their determination, dignity and pride in the face of obstruction are very impressive. All whom I met were studying or, like Kannan, struggling to get into school, a vital element if a child is to feel included in any society. And yet, according to the Refugee Council, 1,400 asylum-seeking children have no school places. Many come from stable, loving families, and when the impact of trauma is mediated by good experiences before and after the trauma, says Sheila Melzak, their chances of achieving peace of mind are increased. Arturo Correia and Joshua Salo are two who have experienced trauma and violence, but have found help since. Correia, an Angolan, was 14 in 1994 when bombs started falling as he sat in his classroom. He never went home again and knows nothing of his family's fate. He was flown to a Red Cross camp in Luanda with his brother and the other kids from their school. He and his brother were befriended by a Frenchman who worked for an aid agency. He got them passports, air tickets to the UK and gave them $600. The $600 was stolen before they reached the UK. \"We asked the cabin crew where to go when the plane landed, but they couldn't help us,\" says Correia. \"Luckily, someone took us to a Red Cross lady who spoke Portuguese.\" It was she who interviewed them. Correia and his brother were taken to a foster family, who were very kind, and whose teenage children managed to communicate with",

      "body": "<p>A Christian Lacroix catwalk show is a little like an old-fashioned children's bedtime story brought to life. One where, in the dead of night, everything in the attic dressing-up box - a swathe of ruched raspberry satin, say, a chiffon stole, ballet shoe ribbons, some pompoms, a black lace veil, crystal beads, a garland of midnight blue feathers, a scrap of harlequin print, some ostrich leather - comes alive and unites in an ecstatic dance to create an extraordinary, 4am vision of a party dress. The kind of dress you might find yourself wearing in a particularly surreal dream. Beautiful the clothes may be, staggeringly expensive they certainly are, but there's an engaging whimsy, a wilful madness about them. \"I found some photos of cats dyed blue and pink, and of a masked ball in French Africa or French Indochina at the turn of the century,\" is the best explanation Lacroix can give of his latest haute couture collection.</p> <p>Lacroix burst on to the fashion scene in the mid-80s in a cloud of puffball skirts and hyperbole. The newspaper France Soir called him \"a Messiah\". The Guardian called his work \"a rallying cry for the liberation of couture\". No one since Yves Saint Laurent a quarter of a century earlier had made such an impact, and no single new arrival since has caused such universal excitement.</p> <p>Yet Lacroix's clothes are not conceptual or challenging in the mould of Issey Miyake or Hussein Chalayan. Neither are they clothes for the Armani and Jil Sander devotees who harness the power of the perfect charcoal jacket to their own ends. Nor do they have the calculated, goal-oriented sexuality of Versace. They are girlish and chichi and frou-frou and flouncy, overflowing with pomp and ceremony. In other words, they are not everyone's cup of tea.</p> <p>Whatever you think of his clothes, it would be hard to dislike Lacroix himself. Most fashion designers make female visitors from the real world feel immediately ill at ease - too short, too lumpen, too loud. Lacroix, however, does not give the impression that his idea of feminine perfection is a wispy, pencil fashion illustration. The Christian Lacroix who presides over the Rue du Faubourg St Honor\u00e9 salon looks youthful for 50, with prominent eyebrows and fleshy lips; a cross between a young Orson Welles and Marlon Brando. Dressed in jeans, bright red trainers and a coffee-coloured poloneck, he seems quite disengaged from Christian Lacroix, couturier and dreamer of pink cats.</p> <p>He is a man at home in the realm of theatre and character: since 1985, he has had a parallel career as a costume designer, and in 1996 won the prestigious Moli\u00e8re award for best costumes for a Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise production of Racine's Ph\u00e8dre. \"When I'm designing fashion, it's as if I have a twin. He's a funny guy and I'm like, what is he doing? I am much more myself in my theatre work.\" He is at ease with such contradictions. This is a designer who is famous for fairytale wedding dresses - most recently, Catherine Zeta-Jones's - yet his own wife, and collaborator, Fran\u00e7oise, whom he married 10 years ago after 18 years together, wore as a bridal gown a second-hand smock she'd found in Portobello market.</p> <p>Nonetheless, there is a lot of Lacroix in his designs. In particular, he attributes his flamboyant, baroque style to the influence of his native south of France. Christian Marie Lacroix was born in Arles, the son of an engineer from the mountains of C\u00e9vennes whom he describes as strict, sober and moral, and a \"warm, emotional\" Proven\u00e7al mother. After graduating from the University of Montpellier, Lacroix left behind the bullfights and black Spanish lace of Arles to study art history and museum studies at the Sorbonne and the \u00c9cole du Louvre in Paris, with the vague intention of curating at a costume museum. Instead, he found a job as an illustrator at Herm\u00e8s, and moved into fashion.</p> <p>By 1981, Lacroix was designing for the house of Jean Patou. It was during his five years there that Lacroix made his name, whipping up excitement with haute couture collections full of wit and verve at a time when couture - fashion's most exclusive circle, in which fantastical clothes are made to order for the indulgent rich - was generally considered a dying art. In 1986, Lacroix won the Golden Thimble award for his couture work.</p> <p>It was then that Lacroix met a very ambitious young French businessman called Bernard Arnault. Arnault - now chairman of luxury goods giant LVMH - saw in Lacroix the chance to create a new, lucrative fashion brand name, an image that could be marketed, like Coco Chanel or Yves Saint Laurent, to sell tubes of lipstick and bottles of perfume by the million. With an innate understanding of the economics of luxury, he knew that in concocting the image no expense could be spared. Lacroix was given a fabulous salon on the Rue du Faubourg St Honor\u00e9 and blank cheques to pay the most fashionable decorators in Paris. With a team of the most skilled seamstresses on hand, he was given free rein to launch the house of Christian Lacroix.</p> <p>The first couture collection in July 1987 was a soaraway success. Fashion editors stood on their chairs and threw flowers at the designer. The debut knocked Yves Saint Laurent from his long-established position on the front page of American industry bible Women's Wear Daily. The signature shape was a shoulder-less cone with a puffball skirt, layered with previously unimagined multiple combinations of colour and fabric, a veritable knickerbocker glory of fashion. This was the giddy peak of the bloated 80s, and the Ivana Trumps of the world loved Lacroix for releasing them from power dressing and into extravagant, be-ribboned babydollery.</p> <p>But in the autumn of that year, while he was working on his first ready-to-wear collection, the New York stock exchange crashed and the bubble in which Lacroix had been conceived was burst. In his first two years in the couture business, he sold just 20 dresses. The timing was lucky, however - a year later, it would have been inconceivable folly for anyone to fund a new couture house but, having invested heavily, Arnault stuck by him.</p> <p>The recession hit Lacroix hard, not just because fewer people could afford his clothes, but because his playful show-offery jarred with the mood of the times. But a loyal flow of critical support, and Arnault's steady financial backing, saw him through, and in recent years the pendulum has begun to swing back in his favour. Renewed economic confidence is reflected in the emergence of celebrities such as Zeta-Jones, the kind of diamond-wearing actress who is isn't afraid to wear movie star clothes, and the revival of 80s style. At last July's couture show, for the first time in years the most influential stylists were applauding the same outfits as the sable-clad front row.</p> <p>He may have invented the puffball skirt, but for Lacroix fashion is not about trends. \"It is always the same story,\" he says matter-of-factly, \"but with different ingredients each season. It is east meets west, north meets south, past meets future. Always.\" But while he finds the relentless speed of the seasonal trend cycle pointless, Lacroix is nonetheless determined to move his image forward. \"To a lot of people, I'm still the guy with the heavy buttoned silk and all that. I know I can never sell a little black suit. There are so many places to buy a little black suit, and if women come here they want something sparkling. But I don't always want to be about the south and bullfighting. I'm tired of it - not tired of it in my personal life, but tired of having just this image. It is a very tricky subject.</p> <p>I did an interview with [the French newspaper] Lib\u00e9ration, where I told the truth - that I'm not bored with the land or the country or any of that, but I'm bored with the caricature, bored with being pinned down like a butterfly on a pin. And the headline was, 'Lacroix turns his back on the south', with a photo of me turning my back. And I was so sad, because some old ladies who knew my family were really upset. And I was sad because I would never have been able to do this job without Arles, my inspiration. But there is more to Christian Lacroix than that.\"</p> <p>While the ready-to-wear collection accounts for the bulk of business, Lacroix prefers the indulgence and personal touch of haute couture. \"The new couture customers are brilliant. The Middle East is very important to us for business, and the younger customers are very different. Twenty years ago, it was forbidden for me to see the girls, they wore veils. Those women still do, but their daughters, whom I am dressing now, have grown up in London, New York, Switzerland, Paris, and they are not stuck in the lifestyle of their region.\"</p> <p>New York, Lacroix says, is \"the best place for selling suits and cocktail dresses\", while in Europe, it's \"wedding, wedding, wedding, wedding, wedding\". In making wedding dresses, Lacroix's role is to function as \"an assistant to the imagination\" of wealthy young women. \"The girls who come here, they have a certain story in their mind about their wedding, and they've had it since they were little. Sometimes they bring me sketches they did when they were five. It's more about playing a certain character than about fashion.\"</p> <p>But behind the fairytale, this is a business. Lacroix is \"not crazy\" about giving free clothes to celebrities. \"I much prefer when it's done with the true couture relationship - money and heart, both.\" There are exceptions, however, \"as with Catherine [Zeta-Jones]. I met her for the first time two years ago, and there is a real chemistry. Of course, it was very lucky for us that she decided to order [her wedding dress] from here. But... it wasn't about any beautiful young actress having a dress. At one fitting, she cried.\" Beautiful young actresses are good publicity, however, and Lacroix admits his representatives will be in LA before the Oscars, because \"it's a good way of having people in the public thinking about my work\".</p> <p>Nothing in his career has made Lacroix as \"touched, moved, proud, happy\" as winning the Moli\u00e8re award for Ph\u00e8dre. Of more than 20 theatre, ballet and opera productions for which he has designed costumes, Ph\u00e8dre is his favourite: \"Not just because I got the award. It was such an achievement for me, because I studied Ph\u00e8dre at school and the company was the French national theatre, and that made me very proud.\" It was also a challenge. \"Since I won the award, I am considered a costume maker, but at that time I was seen as just a couturier, and some of the actresses weren't happy to begin with. They would say to me, 'It's not a fashion show, you know, I'm old, I'm not pretty', and I'd have to spend a long time to make them feel secure. There were corsets, and at the beginning the actresses hated me, really hated me, for them. But step by step they understood that corsets can provide such strength. If they are really beautifully made, millimetre by millimetre, they actually help you to breathe and to speak and to stand.\"</p> <p>To Lacroix, both fashion and costume design are deeply personal, relying on understanding and building relationships with those who will wear the clothes. In theatre, ballet and opera, he is inspired by those he is dressing. \"It was very moving, working with the Balanchine [Lacroix designed costumes for the Vienna Ballet Company's 1998 production of George Balanchine's Theme And Variations]. One ballet was very, very difficult, and in the first rehearsals they were screaming with pain, but one month later they were so elegant, smiling and dancing. Working with people like that is amazing.\"</p> <p>Theatre is a natural direction for a designer who \"always saw the world like a movie, was always translating and augmenting reality into my own vision\". There are elements of this in his fashion work, as well. \"I read Monsieur Dior's biography, and it was called Christian Dior et Moi. He had the exact same feeling I do: looking at himself from outside. In his mind he was still the guy from Normandy, and the couturier was a role he was playing.\"</p> <p>Lacroix has felt a greater sense of distance from his birthplace since the death of his mother last year. \"I don't feel I belong to any place. I belong to my family, of course - I have a younger sister - but my mother was the last of the older generation of my family, and you are rooted to the land through your ancestors. They are your anchor. Today, I feel more than ever connected to the future. Ten years ago, my work was connected with the past, with nostalgia, but now the engine driving me is my life here now and the future.\"</p> <p>Life here and now centres around Fran\u00e7oise and their new home in the Bastille district of Paris, where they recently moved from their longtime residence in St Germain des Pr\u00e9s. \"I like to work at home. I love this house [the Christian Lacroix headquarters], but I feel it is a bit far from everything.\" With its curvy sofas and self-conscious glamour - even the stepladders are painted gold - the house feels more like a perfume bottle than an office. \"In the Bastille I feel more at home. There are all the old smoky cafes, and I feel connected to Paris - to the real Paris, rather than to the Rue du Faubourg St Honor\u00e9.\" Fran\u00e7oise is a key collaborator in Lacroix's designs - \"She's a girl,\" he explains simply - and much of the crucial initial work takes place in their home. \"The best time is in the morning. I love to be up at six, with a strong coffee and a very hot shower. That is the best time to work.\"</p> <p>Never having had children, the couple \"have a kind of freedom. Not so many responsibilities. So there are opportunities now to do other things. I would like this house to be open to other things.\" He is a \"great admirer\" of his fellow French designer Agn\u00e8s b, who has long combined a successful business with political involvement. \"I'm a little bit tired of people in fashion being too scared to say the word politics. I don't feel like that. My wife and I... we were 20 in 1971. We are part of that generation. It might sound pretentious, but it is something I would like to be more involved in.\"</p> <p>Agn\u00e8s b is a lifelong campaigner for equal rights. On principle, she refuses to advertise. \"What I so admire about Agn\u00e8s is that she is connected with politics not in an artificial or social way. It's not about attending a dinner with a red ribbon on your lapel, because it's fashionable to be involved with Aids. Nobody knows how deeply, how strongly, how efficiently she has acted.\"</p> <p>Lacroix says that \"everyone knows\" that, like Agn\u00e8s b, he is left wing, \"even though I never belong to a political party\". But his political convictions are edged with haze. \"Things are not black and white. You know, I don't think that because I am for some ideas it means I have to be against other ideas.\" He is more forthright on safer territory, discussing his wish to utilise his position to be a useful patron to young artists. \"When I'm not working, I don't want to be at parties with stars. Mine is a wonderful job, and I do it with energy and with pleasure. But come seven or eight in the evening, if I'm at an exhibition opening with an artist having a drink and talking about their work, I feel something stronger than when I'm talking about the colour of a jacket. I don't mean to be rude by that. But when I spend time with artists... I feel like I've found my true world.\"</p> <p>Lacroix diverges from his professed role model, however, over their principles on the issue of fur. Whereas Agn\u00e8s b is vehemently anti-fur, Lacroix has used it with abandon. Does he not think this is wrong? \"Of course I feel guilty. You justify it - I mean, it's cowardly, but we're like, they're dead, they're here in the studio, they're dyed pink, perhaps if we use them it's a kind of homage. But it's very embarrassing. I mean, I have a cat. And it's difficult... everyone knows I'm a bullfight lover, too, and it's very hard to make people understand that when you like bullfights you love bulls. It's something connected with the old way and the culture of the south... But I know, I know, it's two-faced.\"</p> <p>Perhaps being a little two-faced is inevitable, working as Lacroix does under the protection and patronage of LVMH. For all his plans, Christian Lacroix does not, in fact, control this house - and he knows it. \"The thing is, I'm not like Agn\u00e8s. This is not my house. I'm very grateful to Monsieur Arnault, because he still believes this house has a future. People love to say we are enemies, but we're not. We're different, but we have a good chemistry. But it still means I belong to a group, and I have to act... not exactly as they want me to act, but not always the black sheep. Things would be different if the money was mine.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "A Christian Lacroix catwalk show is a little like an old-fashioned children's bedtime story brought to life. One where, in the dead of night, everything in the attic dressing-up box - a swathe of ruched raspberry satin, say, a chiffon stole, ballet shoe ribbons, some pompoms, a black lace veil, crystal beads, a garland of midnight blue feathers, a scrap of harlequin print, some ostrich leather - comes alive and unites in an ecstatic dance to create an extraordinary, 4am vision of a party dress. The kind of dress you might find yourself wearing in a particularly surreal dream. Beautiful the clothes may be, staggeringly expensive they certainly are, but there's an engaging whimsy, a wilful madness about them. \"I found some photos of cats dyed blue and pink, and of a masked ball in French Africa or French Indochina at the turn of the century,\" is the best explanation Lacroix can give of his latest haute couture collection. Lacroix burst on to the fashion scene in the mid-80s in a cloud of puffball skirts and hyperbole. The newspaper France Soir called him \"a Messiah\". The Guardian called his work \"a rallying cry for the liberation of couture\". No one since Yves Saint Laurent a quarter of a century earlier had made such an impact, and no single new arrival since has caused such universal excitement. Yet Lacroix's clothes are not conceptual or challenging in the mould of Issey Miyake or Hussein Chalayan. Neither are they clothes for the Armani and Jil Sander devotees who harness the power of the perfect charcoal jacket to their own ends. Nor do they have the calculated, goal-oriented sexuality of Versace. They are girlish and chichi and frou-frou and flouncy, overflowing with pomp and ceremony. In other words, they are not everyone's cup of tea. Whatever you think of his clothes, it would be hard to dislike Lacroix himself. Most fashion designers make female visitors from the real world feel immediately ill at ease - too short, too lumpen, too loud. Lacroix, however, does not give the impression that his idea of feminine perfection is a wispy, pencil fashion illustration. The Christian Lacroix who presides over the Rue du Faubourg St Honor\u00e9 salon looks youthful for 50, with prominent eyebrows and fleshy lips; a cross between a young Orson Welles and Marlon Brando. Dressed in jeans, bright red trainers and a coffee-coloured poloneck, he seems quite disengaged from Christian Lacroix, couturier and dreamer of pink cats. He is a man at home in the realm of theatre and character: since 1985, he has had a parallel career as a costume designer, and in 1996 won the prestigious Moli\u00e8re award for best costumes for a Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise production of Racine's Ph\u00e8dre. \"When I'm designing fashion, it's as if I have a twin. He's a funny guy and I'm like, what is he doing? I am much more myself in my theatre work.\" He is at ease with such contradictions. This is a designer who is famous for fairytale wedding dresses - most recently, Catherine Zeta-Jones's - yet his own wife, and collaborator, Fran\u00e7oise, whom he married 10 years ago after 18 years together, wore as a bridal gown a second-hand smock she'd found in Portobello market.

Fashion editors stood on their chairs and threw flowers at the designer. The debut knocked Yves Saint Laurent from his long-established position on the front page of American industry bible Women's Wear Daily. The signature shape was a shoulder-less cone with a puffball skirt, layered with previously unimagined multiple combinations of colour and fabric, a veritable knickerbocker glory of fashion. This was the giddy peak of the bloated 80s, and the Ivana Trumps of the world loved Lacroix for releasing them from power dressing and into extravagant, be-ribboned babydollery. But in the autumn of that year, while he was working on his first ready-to-wear collection, the New York stock exchange crashed and the bubble in which Lacroix had been conceived was burst. In his first two years in the couture business, he sold just 20 dresses. The timing was lucky, however - a year later, it would have been inconceivable folly for anyone to fund a new couture house but, having invested heavily, Arnault stuck by him. The recession hit Lacroix hard, not just because fewer people could afford his clothes, but because his playful show-offery jarred with the mood of the times. But a loyal flow of critical support, and Arnault's steady financial backing, saw him through, and in recent years the pendulum has begun to swing back in his favour. Renewed economic confidence is reflected in the emergence of celebrities such as Zeta-Jones, the kind of diamond-wearing actress who is isn't afraid to wear movie star clothes, and the revival of 80s style. At last July's couture show, for the first time in years the most influential stylists were applauding the same outfits as the sable-clad front row. He may have invented the puffball skirt, but for Lacroix fashion is not about trends. \"It is always the same story,\" he says matter-of-factly, \"but with different ingredients each season.

At the Friday night dinner - not an official stag occasion - my neighbour, a friendly Leicester solicitor, described the depressingly bestial nature of the live sex show he had once witnessed during a stag night in Amsterdam. His party was not alone; a group of Welshmen was undergoing the same rite of passage (in every sense of the word). After the opening tableau - couple copulating on stage - the entertainment progressed to a naked woman with a lighted candle who dripped hot wax all over her body.

He was accidentally headbutted in the face by the three-year-old son of a friend who lives near the Parc Monceau. Which is not to say that scenes of Lucullan excess were entirely lacking. It was calculated on Sunday morning that, during the 18-hour binging session that the rest of the world knew as Saturday, several stags consumed at least 14 pints of lager each.

First, that it was much more fun being a stag than a hen - one Scottish friend of mine was tied to a dustcart and pelted with rubbish the week before her wedding, while my own toe-curling pre-marital ordeal was to be serenaded for what seemed like hours by the Chinese Elvis in the Old Kent Road. The second and more amazing revelation was that - listen up, ladies - men really can communicate socially. They can analyse, amuse and - shock, horror - even gossip. I have seen it, heard it, witnessed the affection and good humour between 13 men, who, from the moment they met to the moment they parted, never stopped nattering. The refreshing 14 pints of lager a day, however, definitely helped.</p> <p>I also returned to London pondering on the many small but crucial cultural differences that mark out the French from the British.

Bendy French buses, horse meat, men's socks that look like tights, bits of carpet in the gutter and the fact that absolutely everyone smokes. And, most of all, bolsters. These bizarre, pipe-shaped, continuous pillows come in all shapes and sizes, from Peperami to Toulouse sausages, and not one of them permits more than 40 minutes' fitful dozing. So what are they for?

      "body": "<p><strong>The Micro-Meadow </strong></p> <p> Everyone is attracted by the idea of a meadow, or by the notion that meadow conditions can be imitated in the garden. A few discouraging but realistic remarks might be helpful. One thing I never see emphasised is that a meadow - a real meadow, that is - is a field with a product. If you have no use for the product, the hay, you are likely to have a problem with a meadow. </p> <p>I recently read an admirable account of a garden grown largely for the benefit of insects: every plant was rated according to the number and variety of insects it attracted. Towards the end, the author admitted that, finding it hard to compost the hay from her garden, she had the local council cart it away instead. But there must be something wrong with the ecology of growing hay for council infill sites. </p> <p>Another thing that sets my teeth on edge when meadow-enthusiasts describe what they have done is the insistence that, since meadow flowers grow best on poor soil, you should lower the fertility of your soil before you begin. So far, so justifiable. But they go on to say that, if necessary, you should remove the fertile topsoil before sowing your meadow seed mixture. </p> <p>I protest. Who is handing out this destructive advice, and who is listening to it? Who is carting away his or her fertile topsoil, and what are they finding underneath when they have done so? What plants, what bulbs, what seeds are being carted away? And what have they done wrong? </p> <p>It is only from the specialist point of view of the gardener that a meadow must have low fertility. An actual working meadow may have at least two obvious sources of fertility. It may have clover. Does the meadow gardener propose to exclude clover from the mix, on the grounds that it introduces too much nitrogen in the soil? </p> <p>The second source of fertility is, of course, animals. \"Sheep eat the grass, then dung the ground for more,\" wrote that admirable poet George Herbert, describing a desirable aspect of providence. A meadow is grown for its hay. When that is cut, and the grasses have grown again, the field is grazed. Among the beneficial effects (from the point of view of the meadow gardener) of this grazing is the fact that the cattle tread the new seed into the ground. Indeed, one way in which you can turn a cultivated field into a meadow, and which we have practised on my farm with some success, is to take the hay from another meadow and spread it over the target area, and then put cattle on it. The cattle both eat the hay (or not, if they don't feel like it) and tread it under foot. </p> <p>The easiest way to start a meadow is to take a field or patch of lawn and put it under a meadow regime: no fertilisers, pesticides or herbicides, no animals to graze it, no mower to touch it before the first cut of the year - and this cut to come only after the seeds of the desirable wildflowers have been allowed to ripen. Meadows, like lawns, arise through management, and this is the basic management for a wildflower meadow. The results are to be appreciated over years, decades even. </p> <p>This kind of meadow is distinct from the vision you tend to see in blurry pastel photographs, in which poppies, cornflowers and corncockle give an \"impressionist\" effect. The annual flowers blooming in such fields are the weeds of cornfields, and in order to bloom readily they need a cornfield regime. But this implies annual ploughing - and this is very far from the repertory of most gardeners. </p> <p>However, what is possible - and much easier to achieve than a really satisfactory perennial wildflower meadow (which should be viewed as a longterm project) - is a micro-meadow of annual flowers, grown in a small patch. Two years ago, we did this, and the reaction of visitors was always at first to laugh at the small scale of our project: intended as a cornfield with traditional extras, it measured only six paces by two. </p> <p>The corn we took from a handful or two of mixed birdseed - a mistake, since such seed may often be heat-treated, which destroys its viability. The wildflowers came from a couple of packets of wildflower mix, available in any garden centre, together with the things we particularly wanted: cornflowers (which have featured earlier in this list) (no 61) Agrostemma githago or Corncockle, and (no 62) Papaver rhoeas or Field Poppy. </p> <p>The ground was prepared in April and the seed mixture scattered over. In the early stages, some obvious weeds were removed, others, like the purple-flowered Wall Fumitory, Fumaria muralis , were left. A dominant presence among the flowers, along with the cornflowers and poppies, was Corn Chamomile, Anthemis arvensis . In due course, we had a spectacular display, but little evidence of corn in our field. </p> <p>Later I was reading the introduction to Annuals and Biennials, the important book by Roger Phillips and Martyn Rix which I have already mentioned, when I came across this sentence: \"Poppies, cornflowers, corn-cockle and Nigella, combined with some grasses, umbelliferae and white daisies, will make a fine scheme to recreate a Neolithic Mediterranean cornfield.\" This was indeed what we had achieved, with just the sort of poor germination of corn that Neolithic man might have expected in a bad year, but with compensating blooms of (no 63) Leucanthemum vulgare or Ox-eye Daisy. </p> <p>Chiltern Seeds offer (no 64) a Mixture of Annual Varieties, and (no 65) a Mixture of Perennial Varieties, which could serve as a basis for two such miniature schemes. Of interest as well is (no 66) their California Wildflower mixture. Phillips and Rix go on to say that \"Californian annuals include the wonderful blue and purple Phacelia and the pale blue Nemophila, as well as the different colours of Californian poppies. Lupins, Clarkias and white Oenothera complete a grouping which could occur in California.\" </p> <p>An article in the current issue of the Garden, the Journal of the Royal Horticultural Society, reports on experiments with this kind of direct sowing. It recommends a thin layer of sand spread over the bed as a weed-suppressing mulch (the seeds being sown onto this sand), and it shows the difference between results with or without a modest use of slug pellets. The authors calculate that to plant a square metre with herbaceous perennial plants may cost \u00a320-\u00a325 at garden centre prices; using seed, the same area comes out at 20-50p. </p> <p>\u0095 All the seeds mentioned above may be had from Chiltern Seeds, Bortree Stile, Ulverstone, Cumbria LA12 7PB, or <a href=\"http://www.chiternseeds.co.uk\">www.chiternseeds.co.uk</a></p>",

If you have no use for the product, the hay, you are likely to have a problem with a meadow. I recently read an admirable account of a garden grown largely for the benefit of insects: every plant was rated according to the number and variety of insects it attracted. Towards the end, the author admitted that, finding it hard to compost the hay from her garden, she had the local council cart it away instead. But there must be something wrong with the ecology of growing hay for council infill sites. Another thing that sets my teeth on edge when meadow-enthusiasts describe what they have done is the insistence that, since meadow flowers grow best on poor soil, you should lower the fertility of your soil before you begin. So far, so justifiable. But they go on to say that, if necessary, you should remove the fertile topsoil before sowing your meadow seed mixture. I protest. Who is handing out this destructive advice, and who is listening to it? Who is carting away his or her fertile topsoil, and what are they finding underneath when they have done so? What plants, what bulbs, what seeds are being carted away? And what have they done wrong? It is only from the specialist point of view of the gardener that a meadow must have low fertility. An actual working meadow may have at least two obvious sources of fertility. It may have clover. Does the meadow gardener propose to exclude clover from the mix, on the grounds that it introduces too much nitrogen in the soil? The second source of fertility is, of course, animals. \"Sheep eat the grass, then dung the ground for more,\" wrote that admirable poet George Herbert, describing a desirable aspect of providence. A meadow is grown for its hay. When that is cut, and the grasses have grown again, the field is grazed. Among the beneficial effects (from the point of view of the meadow gardener) of this grazing is the fact that the cattle tread the new seed into the ground. Indeed, one way in which you can turn a cultivated field into a meadow, and which we have practised on my farm with some success, is to take the hay from another meadow and spread it over the target area, and then put cattle on it. The cattle both eat the hay (or not, if they don't feel like it) and tread it under foot. The easiest way to start a meadow is to take a field or patch of lawn and put it under a meadow regime: no fertilisers, pesticides or herbicides, no animals to graze it, no mower to touch it before the first cut of the year - and this cut to come only after the seeds of the desirable wildflowers have been allowed to ripen. Meadows, like lawns, arise through management, and this is the basic management for a wildflower meadow. The results are to be appreciated over years, decades even. This kind of meadow is distinct from the vision you tend to see in blurry pastel photographs, in which poppies, cornflowers and corncockle give an \"impressionist\" effect. The annual flowers blooming in such fields are the weeds of cornfields, and in order to bloom readily they need a cornfield regime. But this implies annual ploughing - and this is very far from the repertory of most gardeners. However, what is possible - and much easier to achieve than a really satisfactory perennial wildflower meadow (which should be viewed as a longterm project) - is a micro-meadow of annual flowers, grown in a small patch. Two years ago, we did this, and the reaction of visitors was always at first to laugh at the small scale of our project: intended as a cornfield with traditional extras, it measured only six paces by two. The corn we took from a handful or two of mixed birdseed - a mistake, since such seed may often be heat-treated, which destroys its viability. The wildflowers came from a couple of packets of wildflower mix, available in any garden centre, together with the things we particularly wanted: cornflowers (which have featured earlier in this list) (no 61) Agrostemma githago or Corncockle, and (no 62) Papaver rhoeas or Field Poppy. The ground was prepared in April and the seed mixture scattered over. In the early stages, some obvious weeds were removed, others, like the purple-flowered Wall Fumitory, Fumaria muralis , were left. A dominant presence among the flowers, along with the cornflowers and poppies, was Corn Chamomile, Anthemis arvensis . In due course, we had a spectacular display, but little evidence of corn in our field. Later I was reading the introduction to Annuals and Biennials, the important book by Roger Phillips and Martyn Rix which I have already mentioned, when I came across this sentence: \"Poppies, cornflowers, corn-cockle and Nigella, combined with some grasses, umbelliferae and white daisies, will make a fine scheme to recreate a Neolithic Mediterranean cornfield.\" This was indeed what we had achieved, with just the sort of poor germination of corn that Neolithic man might have expected in a bad year, but with compensating blooms of (no 63) Leucanthemum vulgare or Ox-eye Daisy. Chiltern Seeds offer (no 64) a Mixture of Annual Varieties, and (no 65) a Mixture of Perennial Varieties, which could serve as a basis for two such miniature schemes. Of interest as well is (no 66) their California Wildflower mixture. Phillips and Rix go on to say that \"Californian annuals include the wonderful blue and purple Phacelia and the pale blue Nemophila, as well as the different colours of Californian poppies. Lupins, Clarkias and white Oenothera complete a grouping which could occur in California.\" An article in the current issue of the Garden, the Journal of the Royal Horticultural Society, reports on experiments with this kind of direct sowing. It recommends a thin layer of sand spread over the bed as a weed-suppressing mulch (the seeds being sown onto this sand), and it shows the difference between results with or without a modest use of slug pellets. The authors calculate that to plant a square metre with herbaceous perennial plants may cost \u00a320-\u00a325 at garden centre prices; using seed, the same area comes out at 20-50p. \u0095 All the seeds mentioned above may be had from Chiltern Seeds, Bortree Stile, Ulverstone, Cumbria LA12 7PB, or www.chiternseeds.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>Perched at the top of a treacherously narrow stairway sandwiched between the Strand Theatre and the Waldorf Hotel in central London, the headquarters of Thelma Holt Ltd has all the fugitive ambience of a backstage dressing room. Hardly more than an attic annexe in what was once Ivor Novello's West End eyrie, its faded walls are cluttered with the inevitable theatrical posters and framed Olivier awards, recalling such Holt-produced triumphs as the Redgraves' Three Sisters and Yukio Ninagawa's Tango At The End Of Winter. Elsewhere, cut-out pictorial relics of Holt's acting years lean at odd angles from behind filing cabinets, one showing an imposing, gamine, razor-jawed redhead dressed in a corset and brandishing a whip. </p> <p>And strewn everywhere is that carefully-chosen rummage characteristic of theatre people: an untidy collage of newspaper headlines, the topmost proclaiming \"Theatre is for Wankers\", a Japanese wall-hanging surmounted by a tacky picture of the Virgin Mary; and, in one corner, an embroidered cushion bearing a legend that might plausibly serve as Holt's epitaph: \"If I wanted your opinion, I would have stopped talking by now.\" </p> <p>In the centre of the room, reclining regally on a dimpled leather chair, commanding attention like the grande dame of some long- running West End show, is the irrepressible Thelma Holt herself, one of Britain's best known theatre impresarios. Her assistant, Sweetpea, has already given a warning about our first meeting: \"You might be forgiven for thinking she's absolutely bonkers. She's capable of anything, from storing champagne in the dishwasher to going to the theatre on a first night and forgetting to put her dress on, so that she is just wearing her satin overcoat.\" </p> <p>Holt, dressed today in Issey Miyake, her favourite designer - plus a pair of bright orange pumps - does not disappoint. She launches into a long, swerving monologue about something called Ignatian Theory, in which an Irish priest called Father Billy has apparently been instructing her. Then we're on to the first time she met Robert Maxwell, her patron at north London's famously avant-garde Round House theatre in the late 70s: \"He stood at the end of this big conference table,\" she says, \"and he said: 'I'm Robert Maxwell'. He always said that - 'I'm Robert Maxwell - even though everyone knew damn well who he was. Then he said: 'There are three things you need to know about me - I don't drink, I don't gamble and I don't sleep with women'. I'm not that quick but I had St. Anthony protecting me that day. My mouth opened and out came: 'Mr. Maxwell, how splendid! At least we have two things in common.' Of course, I didn't say which two.\" </p> <p>Suddenly she's off on a story about her ex-husband - she's had three - the American actor, Lawrence Pressman: \"I was with a friend and this television thing was on. Rock Hudson was the leading man and there was this other character who was extremely good. I said, 'I know that actor'. And my friend said, 'Yes, dear, it's Rock Hudson'. And I said, 'No, the other one, I know that actor'. At the end I went out to get some coffee and my friend shouted from the living room: 'Of course you know that actor, darling, you were married to him.'\" Only after another hurtling diversion involving both David Mamet and the Arts Council, is she finally distracted by the telephone. </p> <p>Dubbed the First Lady of British Theatre, Thelma Holt is one of the country's most daring and visionary producers, a true maverick who can effortlessly combine the commercial prerogatives of the West End with the panoramic breadth of vision of some of the world's most progressive theatre artists. Over two and half decades, she has introduced the Georgian director Robert Sturua and his Rustaveli company to British theatregoers, produced shows by continental titans such as Peter Stein, Ariane Mnouchkine, Giorgio Strehler, Franco Zeffirelli, and been the tireless champion of the pioneering work of Ninagawa, presenting his Macbeth and Medea at the National Theatre in 1987 and producing nine of his subsequent UK shows. </p> <p>Yet, her outlook has also remained supremely British and she is as much at home with her current production of Noel Coward's Semi-Monde (opening at the Lyric Shaftesbury Avenue on March 21) as any piece of Japanese exotica: \"As a producer she is virtually unique in our business,\" says friend and colleague Cameron Mackintosh. \"She has a passionate commitment to being almost a solo national theatre, in the kind of work she does. She doesn't put down the commercial aspect. She is not in any way a snob. She just believes in great theatre, and she takes wonderful risks.\" </p> <p>On a practical level, Holt is a hands-on producer like no other. Her ongoing love-affair with the acting profession continues unabated, as she dispenses starring roles to friends such as Vanessa Redgrave and Alan Rickman, and makes lifelong friends of her stars, as in Janet McTeer, whose career was transformed by Holt's production of A Doll's House. While many West End casts might be lucky to catch a glimpse of the producer on first night, Holt attends every rehearsal and every performance: \"She specialises in being earth mother to the production,\" says producer and friend Bill Kenwright, \"She's there all the time. It's like she's up on the stage with them. And after the show or during rehearsals, you'll find her taking chicken soup in for the actors.\" </p> <p>While Holt has managed to ascend the male-dominated ranks, she transcends any easy feminist tags: \"Nobody says, 'Oh, here comes a woman who has triumphed in a profession controlled by men',\" says Alan Rickman. \"They just say, 'Oh, here comes Thelma'.\" Yet it is no co-incidence that, in terms of sheer charisma and force of personality, nothing like Holt has graced the theatre world since the last great female crusader, Lilian Baylis. Cameron Mackintosh says, \"She is the living proof that providing you have your beliefs you can make a difference. As the corporate world begins to continually take theatre over, she is brave and crusading, a fantastic beacon.\" </p> <p>In person, Holt is a larger-than-life eccentric, a bravura wit with a jagged edge of artful insanity that makes every conversation a joyride of one-liners and oddball anecdotes. Wholeheartedly genuine and deeply frivolous, she speaks in that plummy, received pronunciation that only a half-Irish, Catholic girl from Lancaster might affect, greeting everyone with the same fountain of \"darlings\" and \"dears\". Every morning she lights candles for her actors in Brompton Oratory, and every night prays to St. Anthony of Padua for the success of her productions. And she's always buzzing with energy: \"She's like Einstein crossed with Bugs Bunny,\" says Kenwright, \"There is genius, which she has in abundance. But there is also more than a touch of Looney Tunes.\" </p> <p>However, Holt can be as shrewd and ruthless as any city banker when it comes to something really important, Sweetpea says. Lord Attenborough, who serves with her on the council at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, says she can also be manipulative, marshalling all the resources of her wayward personality: \"She uses her eccentricity, very cleverly. She'll even fall back on the baffled-woman act, pretending not to understand. Truth being that she is about six feet ahead of everyone else around the table.\" </p> <p>Holt is also ferociously loyal to the people close to her: \"A warm and merry person who cuts through the bullshit,\" according to Vanessa Redgrave, a friend since the 50s. \"Champagne and roses are easy,\" says Janet McTeer, \"but making someone a cup of tea and giving them a cuddle can be quite hard. And that is where Thelma excels.\" In turn, her adopted family of friends and colleagues reciprocates: her assistant Malcolm Taylor has been with her for the past 25 years; and in an astonishing instance of employee devotion, Sweetpea, formerly Jane Slight, whom Holt re-christened after the baby character in the Popeye comic strip when they met 15 years ago, has adopted this pet-name by deed poll. </p> <p>Overall, Holt defies every received notion of the producer in modern theatre. She lives in a modest maisonette in London's Bayswater with her cats Poppy and Psyche, her only outward luxuries the Miyake creations she gets at knock-down prices from a Japanese contact and the religious paraphernalia that lines her bedroom: votive candles, a lush Prie Dieu and a reliquary. \"I'm not a proper producer,\" she says, \"I'm just an actress who has been resting for rather a long time. The thing is that I love actors. I think it is such a brave thing to do. Every night you walk from the dark into the light and you don't know where you are going. That requires a lot of courage and caring for and looking after. It is my job to make that leap possible.\" </p> <p>Thelma Mary Bernadette Holt was born on January 4 1932, in the small Lancashire town of Barton on Irwell, the second daughter of an English electrical engineer named Peter David Holt and Eleanor Finnagh Doyle, an Irishwoman originally from the village of Dunmanway, County Cork. She joined a sister, Elizabeth, who was 10 years older: \"I was a twin - the boy was stillborn,\" she says. \"My sister always maintained that I kicked him to death in the womb.\" </p> <p>From an early age she displayed idiosyncratic religious tendencies: \"I was particularly interested in funerals,\" she recalls, \"I used to hold them in the back garden and bury my sister in a shoe box - it was just a doll, but I would pretend it was my sister. I know it makes me sound like Charlie Manson's aunt, but I used to stand over this shoebox doing the De Profundis.\" She was so captivated by the altar-side theatricality of the Catholic ritual that her earliest ambition was to enter holy orders: \"I wanted to be a priest,\" she beams, \"If at the age of four you are taken to a ceremony that is extremely interesting and smells nice, it's perfectly natural. Plus, there is a leading man in a great frock\" </p> <p>Shortly after the onset of the second world war, when Thelma was eight, her father was killed in an air-raid on Southampton. This early loss has often been cited by Holt and others as the underlying compensatory impulse that has drawn her to dominating, egotistical and patriarchal men (Charles Marowitz, her partner at the Open Space theatre; Robert Maxwell; and Peter Hall, her mentor at the National all broadly fall into this category). However, at the time, the impact was cushioned: \"I cried because Daddy didn't come home,\" she says, \"But I certainly didn't feel any great sense of loss. If there was a vacuum it was immediately filled by a very determined, strong-willed mother.\" </p> <p>Throughout Thelma's early years, the family moved about, first to Hove and then, two years later, to Brighton. But during the war Thelma was sent to live with her Godmother in Lancashire. There she attended St. Anne's School for Girls, going on to become the youngest-ever prefect and later school captain: \"She stood out from the rest of us,\" remembers her friend and classmate Anne Shaw, \"She was very full of it, had lots of personality and was very theatrical. I can remember Thelma walking through the square in St Anne's, snow on the ground, bitterly cold and she's got these great big sunglasses on. And I remember saying to her: 'What are you doing with those on?' And she said, 'Oh darling, you have to be prepared for anything'.\" </p> <p>Realising by now that she was probably deeply unsuited to the priesthood, Holt ploughed her substantial energies into theatre, excelling in male leads in school productions of Gilbert and Sulli van. On leaving St. Anne's she won a place at Rada and joined the class of 1952 alongside Joe Orton, with Joan Collins just a few years ahead. Though her axe-like jawline and striking red hair led to offbeat roles, it was her social virtuosity that contemporaries remember: \"I don't particularly recall Thelma being a shining star,\" says her classmate, the producer and actor David Conville. \"She networked and charmed people while not doing anything too stunning, acting-wise. Everybody liked her.\" </p> <p>During her final-year showcase, Holt was offered a contract by Binkie Beaumont, then one of the West End's most powerful producers. She would spend the following decade playing minor roles and understudying stars, building up a phalanx of prominent theatrical friends (including Redgrave and Jill Bennett) but growing ever more disenchanted with her own prospects: \"I was good. But I wasn't Maggie [Smith] or Vanessa,\" she says, \"I would only want to be Maggie and Vanessa and I knew there was something I could do much, much better.\" </p> <p> Then, in 1965, came an encounter that would radically change the tone, emphasis and direction of Holt's life. Charles Marowitz, an American experimental director and critic was largely responsible for organising, along with Peter Brook, the legendary Theatre of Cruelty seasons at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art in 1963-4. By the mid-60s he was planning his own experimental company, and while casting around for actors, chanced upon Holt in a club theatre production of Leonid Andreyev's He Who Gets Slapped. </p> <p>\"She was wearing a brocade corset, black net stockings, high heels and a bowler hat,\" Marowitz recalls. \"She held a whip in one hand and her countenance was one of the most wicked I had ever seen in a woman.\" Immediately, he explained the prospective avant- garde project, for which he had already located a suitably dingy basement at 32 Tottenham Court Road, and offered Holt the part of Gertrude in a prospective dissected Dadaist production that would later go down in theatre history as the Marowitz Hamlet. </p> <p>\"I didn't believe for a moment I would ever see her again,\" Marowitz writes in his autobiography, Burnt Bridges, \"I could think of nothing more antithetical to an aesthetically driven experimental theatre with a radical bias than the temperament of this slithery, almond-eyed ing\u00e9nue bred on Noel Coward and Terence Rattigan.\" Not only did Holt call back some weeks later to say she would take the part, but offered to help build and finance what would become the Open Space theatre. </p> <p>Over the next eight years, this makeshift 200-seat venue would become the cornerstone of the London fringe, attaining near-mythical status as the subterranean launchpad for a generation of today's most stellar writing talents: \"There were four of us in that cellar, doing these new plays,\" remembers veteran Open Space actor Tony Milner. \"It was just a stream of new writing by people we had never heard of: Howard Brenton, David Hare, Howard Barker, Sam Shepard. Now we can see that was a very rich experience. At the time it seemed we had no idea what we were doing.\" </p> <p>Marowitz also whipped up a storm with his own experimental productions: the mangled Hamlet, which led one critic to lament, \"Alas poor Hamlet, Charles Marowitz has been at him again\", and a cropped Macbeth, with Holt sleepwalking in a see-through nightgown as Lady Macbeth: \"I went on the David Frost programme after that,\" Holt recalls, \"and Mary Whitehouse went for me in a big way. I said: 'I don't understand why you think that anybody is coming to sit through an hour an a half of almost incomprehensible Shakespeare to see a not-at-all well-endowed lady - that's me - when less than 10 minutes away in any phone booth there are telephone numbers of girls with big tits and arses who will give them far better value for money.\" </p> <p>Throughout the Open Space era, Holt and Marowitz maintained an extraordinary partnership, with Holt regularly referring to herself as Mother and the difficult, and sometimes dictatorial Marowitz as Father. From fundraising to feeding actors with vitamins, Holt ran the place with such alacrity that Marowitz suggested she turn full-time to production: \"Thelma supported Charles 100%,\" remembers Tony Milner. \"Without her, nothing would have got done. Thelma kept him elevated, but you knew all the time that if she wasn't there he would fall down.\" </p> <p>Despite rumours, they were not lovers: \"We were as close as two people can be,\" says Marowitz, \"but we shared no sexual relationship. It was more than platonic, we got raided together [in 1970 police confiscated a copy of Warhol's film Flesh and a \u00a3200 fine was imposed], we had to represent the theatre publicly, we were living in each other's pockets. We were platonic lovers. And we shared more than if we had been real lovers.\" In fact, Holt's personal life throughout this period involved more entrances and exits than the average Open Space production. </p> <p>In the same year as she began her collaboration with Marowitz, she met and fell in love with an American actor named Lawrence Pressman, who would briefly become her second husband. Holt, a self-confessed wedding junkie - \"I love the ceremony, and you get to have a great big party afterwards,\" - had married fellow RADA student Patrick Graucob when she was 22, a union which lasted over a decade, but eventually unravelled as Graucob abandoned acting and their interests sharply diverged. Later on, in the early 70s, she would go on to husband number three, referred to only as \"an Italian I met\" who was summarily dispatched back to Italy \"within a matter of weeks\". </p> <p>The relationship with Pressman began in late 1967, when Holt spot ted the handsome 27-year-old in a production of Robert Shaw's The Man In The Glass Booth. An affair began shortly afterwards, and when Pressman returned to America at the end of the run, Holt followed. \"She was nuts, wacky in the best sense of the word,\" says Pressman, going on to tell how Holt, unable to find a sharp knife in his apartment, had once prepared a rice and almond pudding by chewing up almonds and spitting them on the plate. \"The affair had reached that place where you inevitably had to do something, so we decided to get married,\" says Pressman. \"She said, 'I'll talk a Rabbi into marrying us', which she did. I think she promised that she would take instruction. We were married in Mount Neboh Synagogue in October 1968. And then promptly it began to fall apart.\" Unable to withstand the pressure of Holt's devotion to the Open Space and Pressman's reluctance to resettle, their \"legalised love affair\" ended in divorce in 1972. \"Thelma follows her own light,\" says Pressman, \"I wanted to get married and probably have children. I was extremely na\u00efve to think that I could tie a tin can to Thelma.\" </p> <p>The Open Space eventually imploded in 1977 in what became known as the Pink Bathroom Scandal, when Marowitz was accused by a newspaper of purchasing with production funds a bathroom suite for his personal use. He claimed it was for a devised piece to be called Bridal Suite and threatened to sue, but never did. Holt resigned and the whole thing fizzled out. Holt would emerge from the Open Space experience, however, with growing confidence in her burgeoning production abilities, which she immediately put into practice at the eternally cash-strapped Round House. Originally engaged for a year, she stayed for six, building on the legacy of playwright and founder Arnold Wesker's experimentalism with a programme of regional showcases (including Ibsen's Lady From The Sea from the Manchester Royal Exchange Theatre) and international imports (Circus Oz, Antoine Vitez and the Rustaveli Hamlet in 1979). </p> <p>It was during this time that Holt became acquainted with the Round House treasurer and primary sponsor, Robert Maxwell: \"He was unpardonably rude,\" she remembers, \"and he would often shout at me. But if I'm bullied I shoot to kill. He once shouted at me and I shouted back, calling him a Czech spiv. Well, he didn't like that, and rang back to ask why. I said 'Because you are Czech and you wear plastic shoes'. Next time we met, he showed off these brand-new leather shoes he'd bought.\" By the end of their association, during which the duplicitous tycoon simply became known as \"Daddy\", Holt could play the stops of his gargantuan ego so expertly that his family were said to have spoken of her \"hold\" over him. Even Maxwell, though, couldn't save the rodent-infested Round House when it was abandoned by funding bodies in 1983, and Holt presided over its sale. </p> <p>After 18 months at the Theatre of Comedy, where she fulfilled a long-time dream of producing RADA classmate Joe Orton's Loot with Leonard Rossiter in the lead, only to have Rossiter succumb to a heart-attack two weeks into the run, Holt was invited by Peter Hall to become head of touring and commercial exploitation at the National Theatre: \"I gave her a budget and a brief and told her to get on with it,\" says Hall. \"She had an enormous amount of autonomy. She is a very good maverick person to put into an organisation. She rides roughshod over foolishness and she gets terribly angry over inefficiencies. But she doesn't do it for the greater glory of Thelma Holt, but in order to get something on the stage.\" </p> <p>Over the next five years, Holt would mastermind numerous National Theatre foreign tours, including a trek across the US and Canada with Animal Farm and a spectacularly jinxed odyssey through Russia and Georgia with Hall's Cymbeline and The Winter's Tale, during which all the sets and costumes went missing en route to Tblisi: \"Thelma is the best person to have in a crisis,\" remembers Hall. \"In Moscow she was like a combination of a female Diaghilev and a character in a John le Carr\u00e9 novel, spouting stories of how we got around the Russians.\" </p> <p>Holt's crowning achievement at the national was the international season of 1987, when Hall allowed her complete freedom to assemble a programme that would eventually include Ingmar Bergman's Miss Julie, Peter Stein's The Hairy Ape, and Ninagawa's Medea: \"Not since the legendary visit by the Berliner Ensemble in 1956 have we seen a more exciting theatrical import than the Ninagawa Company from Tokyo,\" raved the Guardian, about what was generally regarded as a landmark theatrical event. \"Their production of Euripides's Medea is, quite simply, sensational.\" </p> <p>When Hall left the National in 1989 Holt followed him into the Peter Hall Company before breaking away 18 months later to form Thelma Holt Ltd. Since then, she and Malcolm Taylor and Sweetpea have produced 55 shows from various minuscule West End offices, including Sturua's Three Sisters, the UK transfer of Frank McGuinness's masterpiece Observe The Sons Of Ulster, and A Doll's House, which gleaned four Tony awards. She has also been active in humanitarian areas, making a Unicef film with Vanessa Redgrave on women in Iraq, and organising benefit performances for Romanian orphanages. </p> <p>In the mid-90s, Holt served as chairman of the Arts Council Drama Advisory Panel, antagonising the grey, male-dominated bureaucracy with her unflinching approach. Lord Gowrie, former chairman of the Arts Council, says: \"Thelma was a difficult colleague and I welcomed that. She is someone I love and admire but she can sometimes behave like the great diva she is, full of trembling resignation. She had the ability to make grand alliances but sometimes the reverse was also true. She could be quite quarrelsome.\" </p> <p>Now approaching 70, Holt shows no sign of slowing down. \"Every year she goes to the brink of bankruptcy and every year she bounces back,\" says Kenwright, \"she lives like a hurricane.\" Responding to Sir Richard Eyre's recent homily on the failings of English theatre companies, she says: \"I don't think there is any room in the theatre for pessimists. Many of the things he said were true: London is dirty, it is expensive. But as we speak on Shaftesbury Avenue we have a Medea, a classic that no-one would have dared do 30 years ago, we have The Graduate playing to full houses, and I'm about to open a play with a cast of 29 people. </p> <p>\"I think there is every reason for optimism. You get these articles every three years or so, saying how the theatre is dying. But audiences keep coming. It's certainly no worse than New York. He's absolutely right in much of what he says.

      "bodyText": "Perched at the top of a treacherously narrow stairway sandwiched between the Strand Theatre and the Waldorf Hotel in central London, the headquarters of Thelma Holt Ltd has all the fugitive ambience of a backstage dressing room. Hardly more than an attic annexe in what was once Ivor Novello's West End eyrie, its faded walls are cluttered with the inevitable theatrical posters and framed Olivier awards, recalling such Holt-produced triumphs as the Redgraves' Three Sisters and Yukio Ninagawa's Tango At The End Of Winter. Elsewhere, cut-out pictorial relics of Holt's acting years lean at odd angles from behind filing cabinets, one showing an imposing, gamine, razor-jawed redhead dressed in a corset and brandishing a whip. And strewn everywhere is that carefully-chosen rummage characteristic of theatre people: an untidy collage of newspaper headlines, the topmost proclaiming \"Theatre is for Wankers\", a Japanese wall-hanging surmounted by a tacky picture of the Virgin Mary; and, in one corner, an embroidered cushion bearing a legend that might plausibly serve as Holt's epitaph: \"If I wanted your opinion, I would have stopped talking by now.\" In the centre of the room, reclining regally on a dimpled leather chair, commanding attention like the grande dame of some long- running West End show, is the irrepressible Thelma Holt herself, one of Britain's best known theatre impresarios. Her assistant, Sweetpea, has already given a warning about our first meeting: \"You might be forgiven for thinking she's absolutely bonkers. She's capable of anything, from storing champagne in the dishwasher to going to the theatre on a first night and forgetting to put her dress on, so that she is just wearing her satin overcoat.\" Holt, dressed today in Issey Miyake, her favourite designer - plus a pair of bright orange pumps - does not disappoint. She launches into a long, swerving monologue about something called Ignatian Theory, in which an Irish priest called Father Billy has apparently been instructing her. Then we're on to the first time she met Robert Maxwell, her patron at north London's famously avant-garde Round House theatre in the late 70s: \"He stood at the end of this big conference table,\" she says, \"and he said: 'I'm Robert Maxwell'. He always said that - 'I'm Robert Maxwell - even though everyone knew damn well who he was. Then he said: 'There are three things you need to know about me - I don't drink, I don't gamble and I don't sleep with women'. I'm not that quick but I had St. Anthony protecting me that day. My mouth opened and out came: 'Mr. Maxwell, how splendid! At least we have two things in common.' Of course, I didn't say which two.\" Suddenly she's off on a story about her ex-husband - she's had three - the American actor, Lawrence Pressman: \"I was with a friend and this television thing was on. Rock Hudson was the leading man and there was this other character who was extremely good. I said, 'I know that actor'. And my friend said, 'Yes, dear, it's Rock Hudson'. And I said, 'No, the other one, I know that actor'. At the end I went out to get some coffee and my friend shouted from the living room: 'Of course you know that actor, darling, you were married to him.'\" Only after another hurtling diversion involving both David Mamet and the Arts Council, is she finally distracted by the telephone. Dubbed the First Lady of British Theatre, Thelma Holt is one of the country's most daring and visionary producers, a true maverick who can effortlessly combine the commercial prerogatives of the West End with the panoramic breadth of vision of some of the world's most progressive theatre artists. Over two and half decades, she has introduced the Georgian director Robert Sturua and his Rustaveli company to British theatregoers, produced shows by continental titans such as Peter Stein, Ariane Mnouchkine, Giorgio Strehler, Franco Zeffirelli, and been the tireless champion of the pioneering work of Ninagawa, presenting his Macbeth and Medea at the National Theatre in 1987 and producing nine of his subsequent UK shows. Yet, her outlook has also remained supremely British and she is as much at home with her current production of Noel Coward's Semi-Monde (opening at the Lyric Shaftesbury Avenue on March 21) as any piece of Japanese exotica: \"As a producer she is virtually unique in our business,\" says friend and colleague Cameron Mackintosh. \"She has a passionate commitment to being almost a solo national theatre, in the kind of work she does. She doesn't put down the commercial aspect. She is not in any way a snob. She just believes in great theatre, and she takes wonderful risks.\" On a practical level, Holt is a hands-on producer like no other. Her ongoing love-affair with the acting profession continues unabated, as she dispenses starring roles to friends such as Vanessa Redgrave and Alan Rickman, and makes lifelong friends of her stars, as in Janet McTeer, whose career was transformed by Holt's production of A Doll's House. While many West End casts might be lucky to catch a glimpse of the producer on first night, Holt attends every rehearsal and every performance: \"She specialises in being earth mother to the production,\" says producer and friend Bill Kenwright, \"She's there all the time. It's like she's up on the stage with them. And after the show or during rehearsals, you'll find her taking chicken soup in for the actors.\" While Holt has managed to ascend the male-dominated ranks, she transcends any easy feminist tags: \"Nobody says, 'Oh, here comes a woman who has triumphed in a profession controlled by men',\" says Alan Rickman. \"They just say, 'Oh, here comes Thelma'.\" Yet it is no co-incidence that, in terms of sheer charisma and force of personality, nothing like Holt has graced the theatre world since the last great female crusader, Lilian Baylis. Cameron Mackintosh says, \"She is the living proof that providing you have your beliefs you can make a difference. As the corporate world begins to continually take theatre over, she is brave and crusading, a fantastic beacon.\" In person, Holt is a larger-than-life eccentric, a bravura wit with a jagged edge of artful insanity that makes every conversation a joyride of one-liners and oddball anecdotes. Wholeheartedly genuine and deeply frivolous, she speaks in that plummy, received pronunciation that only a half-Irish, Catholic girl from Lancaster might affect, greeting everyone with the same fountain of \"darlings\" and \"dears\". Every morning she lights candles for her actors in Brompton Oratory, and every night prays to St. Anthony of Padua for the success of her productions. And she's always buzzing with energy: \"She's like Einstein crossed with Bugs Bunny,\" says Kenwright, \"There is genius, which she has in abundance. But there is also more than a touch of Looney Tunes.\" However, Holt can be as shrewd and ruthless as any city banker when it comes to something really important, Sweetpea says. Lord Attenborough, who serves with her on the council at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, says she can also be manipulative, marshalling all the resources of her wayward personality: \"She uses her eccentricity, very cleverly. She'll even fall back on the baffled-woman act, pretending not to understand. Truth being that she is about six feet ahead of everyone else around the table.\" Holt is also ferociously loyal to the people close to her: \"A warm and merry person who cuts through the bullshit,\" according to Vanessa Redgrave, a friend since the 50s. \"Champagne and roses are easy,\" says Janet McTeer, \"but making someone a cup of tea and giving them a cuddle can be quite hard. And that is where Thelma excels.\" In turn, her adopted family of friends and colleagues reciprocates: her assistant Malcolm Taylor has been with her for the past 25 years; and in an astonishing instance of employee devotion, Sweetpea, formerly Jane Slight, whom Holt re-christened after the baby character in the Popeye comic strip when they met 15 years ago, has adopted this pet-name by deed poll. Overall, Holt defies every received notion of the producer in modern theatre. She lives in a modest maisonette in London's Bayswater with her cats Poppy and Psyche, her only outward luxuries the Miyake creations she gets at knock-down prices from a Japanese contact and the religious paraphernalia that lines her bedroom: votive candles, a lush Prie Dieu and a reliquary. \"I'm not a proper producer,\" she says, \"I'm just an actress who has been resting for rather a long time. The thing is that I love actors. I think it is such a brave thing to do. Every night you walk from the dark into the light and you don't know where you are going. That requires a lot of courage and caring for and looking after. It is my job to make that leap possible.\" Thelma Mary Bernadette Holt was born on January 4 1932, in the small Lancashire town of Barton on Irwell, the second daughter of an English electrical engineer named Peter David Holt and Eleanor Finnagh Doyle, an Irishwoman originally from the village of Dunmanway, County Cork. She joined a sister, Elizabeth, who was 10 years older: \"I was a twin - the boy was stillborn,\" she says. \"My sister always maintained that I kicked him to death in the womb.\" From an early age she displayed idiosyncratic religious tendencies: \"I was particularly interested in funerals,\" she recalls, \"I used to hold them in the back garden and bury my sister in a shoe box - it was just a doll, but I would pretend it was my sister. I know it makes me sound like Charlie Manson's aunt, but I used to stand over this shoebox doing the De Profundis.\" She was so captivated by the altar-side theatricality of the Catholic ritual that her earliest ambition was to enter holy orders: \"I wanted to be a priest,\" she beams, \"If at the age of four you are taken to a ceremony that is extremely interesting and smells nice, it's perfectly natural. Plus, there is a leading man in a great frock\" Shortly after the onset of the second world war, when Thelma was eight, her father was killed in an air-raid on Southampton. This early loss has often been cited by Holt and others as the underlying compensatory impulse that has drawn her to dominating, egotistical and patriarchal men (Charles Marowitz, her partner at the Open Space theatre; Robert Maxwell; and Peter Hall, her mentor at the National all broadly fall into this category). However, at the time, the impact was cushioned: \"I cried because Daddy didn't come home,\" she says, \"But I certainly didn't feel any great sense of loss. If there was a vacuum it was immediately filled by a very determined, strong-willed mother.\" Throughout Thelma's early years, the family moved about, first to Hove and then, two years later, to Brighton. But during the war Thelma was sent to live with her Godmother in Lancashire. There she attended St. Anne's School for Girls, going on to become the youngest-ever prefect and later school captain: \"She stood out from the rest of us,\" remembers her friend and classmate Anne Shaw, \"She was very full of it, had lots of personality and was very theatrical. I can remember Thelma walking through the square in St Anne's, snow on the ground, bitterly cold and she's got these great big sunglasses on. And I remember saying to her: 'What are you doing with those on?' And she said, 'Oh darling, you have to be prepared for anything'.\" Realising by now that she was probably deeply unsuited to the priesthood, Holt ploughed her substantial energies into theatre, excelling in male leads in school productions of Gilbert and Sulli van. On leaving St. Anne's she won a place at Rada and joined the class of 1952 alongside Joe Orton, with Joan Collins just a few years ahead. Though her axe-like jawline and striking red hair led to offbeat roles, it was her social virtuosity that contemporaries remember: \"I don't particularly recall Thelma being a shining star,\" says her classmate, the producer and actor David Conville. \"She networked and charmed people while not doing anything too stunning, acting-wise. Everybody liked her.\" During her final-year showcase, Holt was offered a contract by Binkie Beaumont, then one of the West End's most powerful producers. She would spend the following decade playing minor roles and understudying stars, building up a phalanx of prominent theatrical friends (including Redgrave and Jill Bennett) but growing ever more disenchanted with her own prospects: \"I was good. But I wasn't Maggie [Smith] or Vanessa,\" she says, \"I would only want to be Maggie and Vanessa and I knew there was something I could do much, much better.\" Then, in 1965, came an encounter that would radically change the tone, emphasis and direction of Holt's life. Charles Marowitz, an American experimental director and critic was largely responsible for organising, along with Peter Brook, the legendary Theatre of Cruelty seasons at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art in 1963-4. By the mid-60s he was planning his own experimental company, and while casting around for actors, chanced upon Holt in a club theatre production of Leonid Andreyev's He Who Gets Slapped. \"She was wearing a brocade corset, black net stockings, high heels and a bowler hat,\" Marowitz recalls. \"She held a whip in one hand and her countenance was one of the most wicked I had ever seen in a woman.\" Immediately, he explained the prospective avant- garde project, for which he had already located a suitably dingy basement at 32 Tottenham Court Road, and offered Holt the part of Gertrude in a prospective dissected Dadaist production that would later go down in theatre history as the Marowitz Hamlet. \"I didn't believe for a moment I would ever see her again,\" Marowitz writes in his autobiography, Burnt Bridges, \"I could think of nothing more antithetical to an aesthetically driven experimental theatre with a radical bias than the temperament of this slithery, almond-eyed ing\u00e9nue bred on Noel Coward and Terence Rattigan.\" Not only did Holt call back some weeks later to say she would take the part, but offered to help build and finance what would become the Open Space theatre. Over the next eight years, this makeshift 200-seat venue would become the cornerstone of the London fringe, attaining near-mythical status as the subterranean launchpad for a generation of today's most stellar writing talents: \"There were four of us in that cellar, doing these new plays,\" remembers veteran Open Space actor Tony Milner. \"It was just a stream of new writing by people we had never heard of: Howard Brenton, David Hare, Howard Barker, Sam Shepard. Now we can see that was a very rich experience. At the time it seemed we had no idea what we were doing.\" Marowitz also whipped up a storm with his own experimental productions: the mangled Hamlet, which led one critic to lament, \"Alas poor Hamlet, Charles Marowitz has been at him again\", and a cropped Macbeth, with Holt sleepwalking in a see-through nightgown as Lady Macbeth: \"I went on the David Frost programme after that,\" Holt recalls, \"and Mary Whitehouse went for me in a big way. I said: 'I don't understand why you think that anybody is coming to sit through an hour an a half of almost incomprehensible Shakespeare to see a not-at-all well-endowed lady - that's me - when less than 10 minutes away in any phone booth there are telephone numbers of girls with big tits and arses who will give them far better value for money.\" Throughout the Open Space era, Holt and Marowitz maintained an extraordinary partnership, with Holt regularly referring to herself as Mother and the difficult, and sometimes dictatorial Marowitz as Father. From fundraising to feeding actors with vitamins, Holt ran the place with such alacrity that Marowitz suggested she turn full-time to production: \"Thelma supported Charles 100%,\" remembers Tony Milner. \"Without her, nothing would have got done. Thelma kept him elevated, but you knew all the time that if she wasn't there he would fall down.\" Despite rumours, they were not lovers: \"We were as close as two people can be,\" says Marowitz, \"but we shared no sexual relationship. It was more than platonic, we got raided together [in 1970 police confiscated a copy of Warhol's film Flesh and a \u00a3200 fine was imposed], we had to represent the theatre publicly, we were living in each other's pockets. We were platonic lovers. And we shared more than if we had been real lovers.\" In fact, Holt's personal life throughout this period involved more entrances and exits than the average Open Space production. In the same year as she began her collaboration with Marowitz, she met and fell in love with an American actor named Lawrence Pressman, who would briefly become her second husband. Holt, a self-confessed wedding junkie - \"I love the ceremony, and you get to have a great big party afterwards,\" - had married fellow RADA student Patrick Graucob when she was 22, a union which lasted over a decade, but eventually unravelled as Graucob abandoned acting and their interests sharply diverged. Later on, in the early 70s, she would go on to husband number three, referred to only as \"an Italian I met\" who was summarily dispatched back to Italy \"within a matter of weeks\". The relationship with Pressman began in late 1967, when Holt spot ted the handsome 27-year-old in a production of Robert Shaw's The Man In The Glass Booth. An affair began shortly afterwards, and when Pressman returned to America at the end of the run, Holt followed. \"She was nuts, wacky in the best sense of the word,\" says Pressman, going on to tell how Holt, unable to find a sharp knife in his apartment, had once prepared a rice and almond pudding by chewing up almonds and spitting them on the plate. \"The affair had reached that place where you inevitably had to do something, so we decided to get married,\" says Pressman. \"She said, 'I'll talk a Rabbi into marrying us', which she did. I think she promised that she would take instruction. We were married in Mount Neboh Synagogue in October 1968. And then promptly it began to fall apart.\" Unable to withstand the pressure of Holt's devotion to the Open Space and Pressman's reluctance to resettle, their \"legalised love affair\" ended in divorce in 1972. \"Thelma follows her own light,\" says Pressman, \"I wanted to get married and probably have children. I was extremely na\u00efve to think that I could tie a tin can to Thelma.\" The Open Space eventually imploded in 1977 in what became known as the Pink Bathroom Scandal, when Marowitz was accused by a newspaper of purchasing with production funds a bathroom suite for his personal use. He claimed it was for a devised piece to be called Bridal Suite and threatened to sue, but never did. Holt resigned and the whole thing fizzled out. Holt would emerge from the Open Space experience, however, with growing confidence in her burgeoning production abilities, which she immediately put into practice at the eternally cash-strapped Round House. Originally engaged for a year, she stayed for six, building on the legacy of playwright and founder Arnold Wesker's experimentalism with a programme of regional showcases (including Ibsen's Lady From The Sea from the Manchester Royal Exchange Theatre) and international imports (Circus Oz, Antoine Vitez and the Rustaveli Hamlet in 1979). It was during this time that Holt became acquainted with the Round House treasurer and primary sponsor, Robert Maxwell: \"He was unpardonably rude,\" she remembers, \"and he would often shout at me. But if I'm bullied I shoot to kill. He once shouted at me and I shouted back, calling him a Czech spiv. Well, he didn't like that, and rang back to ask why. I said 'Because you are Czech and you wear plastic shoes'. Next time we met, he showed off these brand-new leather shoes he'd bought.\" By the end of their association, during which the duplicitous tycoon simply became known as \"Daddy\", Holt could play the stops of his gargantuan ego so expertly that his family were said to have spoken of her \"hold\" over him. Even Maxwell, though, couldn't save the rodent-infested Round House when it was abandoned by funding bodies in 1983, and Holt presided over its sale. After 18 months at the Theatre of Comedy, where she fulfilled a long-time dream of producing RADA classmate Joe Orton's Loot with Leonard Rossiter in the lead, only to have Rossiter succumb to a heart-attack two weeks into the run, Holt was invited by Peter Hall to become head of touring and commercial exploitation at the National Theatre: \"I gave her a budget and a brief and told her to get on with it,\" says Hall. \"She had an enormous amount of autonomy. She is a very good maverick person to put into an organisation. She rides roughshod over foolishness and she gets terribly angry over inefficiencies. But she doesn't do it for the greater glory of Thelma Holt, but in order to get something on the stage.\" Over the next five years, Holt would mastermind numerous National Theatre foreign tours, including a trek across the US and Canada with Animal Farm and a spectacularly jinxed odyssey through Russia and Georgia with Hall's Cymbeline and The Winter's Tale, during which all the sets and costumes went missing en route to Tblisi: \"Thelma is the best person to have in a crisis,\" remembers Hall. \"In Moscow she was like a combination of a female Diaghilev and a character in a John le Carr\u00e9 novel, spouting stories of how we got around the Russians.\" Holt's crowning achievement at the national was the international season of 1987, when Hall allowed her complete freedom to assemble a programme that would eventually include Ingmar Bergman's Miss Julie, Peter Stein's The Hairy Ape, and Ninagawa's Medea: \"Not since the legendary visit by the Berliner Ensemble in 1956 have we seen a more exciting theatrical import than the Ninagawa Company from Tokyo,\" raved the Guardian, about what was generally regarded as a landmark theatrical event. \"Their production of Euripides's Medea is, quite simply, sensational.\" When Hall left the National in 1989 Holt followed him into the Peter Hall Company before breaking away 18 months later to form Thelma Holt Ltd. Since then, she and Malcolm Taylor and Sweetpea have produced 55 shows from various minuscule West End offices, including Sturua's Three Sisters, the UK transfer of Frank McGuinness's masterpiece Observe The Sons Of Ulster, and A Doll's House, which gleaned four Tony awards. She has also been active in humanitarian areas, making a Unicef film with Vanessa Redgrave on women in Iraq, and organising benefit performances for Romanian orphanages. In the mid-90s, Holt served as chairman of the Arts Council Drama Advisory Panel, antagonising the grey, male-dominated bureaucracy with her unflinching approach. Lord Gowrie, former chairman of the Arts Council, says: \"Thelma was a difficult colleague and I welcomed that. She is someone I love and admire but she can sometimes behave like the great diva she is, full of trembling resignation. She had the ability to make grand alliances but sometimes the reverse was also true. She could be quite quarrelsome.\" Now approaching 70, Holt shows no sign of slowing down. \"Every year she goes to the brink of bankruptcy and every year she bounces back,\" says Kenwright, \"she lives like a hurricane.\" Responding to Sir Richard Eyre's recent homily on the failings of English theatre companies, she says: \"I don't think there is any room in the theatre for pessimists. Many of the things he said were true: London is dirty, it is expensive. But as we speak on Shaftesbury Avenue we have a Medea, a classic that no-one would have dared do 30 years ago, we have The Graduate playing to full houses, and I'm about to open a play with a cast of 29 people. \"I think there is every reason for optimism. You get these articles every three years or so, saying how the theatre is dying. But audiences keep coming. It's certainly no worse than New York. He's absolutely right in much of what he says. But it just means that we must raise the quality of the work.\" But while she regularly questions whether the current environment will continue to allow her to produce her brand of theatre, she won't be giving up soon: \"I worry that it is harder now than ever. We could say 'cool it, don't take risks, we're a small organisation but let's put on a money-making sure-fire hit.' No, thank you. If you think I want to get to that great Round House in the sky with Leonard Rossiter waiting for me screaming abuse, then, no, I wish to be welcome when I get there.\" Life at a glance: Thelma Mary Bernadette Holt.

      "body": "<p>There are some characters in history who, however you turn events around, seem to have been essential to the plot. How do you tell the story of the Roman Empire without Julius Caesar? Or of modern France without Napoleon? And how do you possibly figure British ballet without Dame Ninette de Valois, who died on Thursday? </p> <p>This tiny woman, whose lively charm was always armoured by a military ruthlessness, surprised no one by living to the age of 102. Her tenacity and discipline were famous, and gave rise not only to nicknames - the Hockey Mistress and, most enduringly, Madam - but also to the Royal Ballet, Birmingham Royal Ballet and the Royal Ballet School, whose foundations she began masterminding in the 1920s. </p> <p>Most of the great European ballet companies were established centuries ago as appendages to the royal courts. British ballet was, by comparison, an end-of-pier entertainment. At the beginning of the last century most dance took place on the variety or music hall stages and most dancers scraped a training at private studios. The few who made the grade usually worked abroad, where they had to hide their ignominious origins. Alice Marks became Alicia Markova and Hilda Munnings briefly suffered the indignity of being billed as Munningsova. </p> <p>Edris Stannus from County Wicklow, Ireland, also changed her name - to Ninette de Valois - and, despite beginning her career with the gruesomely-named Wonder Children, was determined to escape what she called \"that sad, bad thing, the English ballet\". She patched together a serious training and in 1923 got a job dancing with Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. At the time, this was the most exciting place to be, but while most of her colleagues clung to the company until Diaghilev's death in 1929, De Valois left after only two years. She didn't want to be a star - she wanted to run her own school and create a national ballet for Britain. </p> <p>The story of her success is well known. After opening a dance academy in London and turning her hand to theatre, opera and ballet, she was hired by Lilian Baylis in 1931 to run a ballet ensemble (and school) at the Old Vic and Sadler's Wells. Baylis's explanation was: \"You seem to have had more experience than all these others, dear.\" But she also saw in De Valois a woman who shared her own exalted vision of a national arts scene, and who could make others see it too. </p> <p>Certainly, despite having no subsidy, De Valois succeeded in poaching most of the best dancers and choreographers for her new Vic-Wells company. Markova agreed to become its first ballerina, even though it meant turning down far more prestigious offers. As she recalls, she couldn't resist De Valois's call to national service. \"Dame Ninette said if we didn't put down some roots now, we'd have no ballet of our own. So I threw in my lot with her. She had that ability to make us feel we all shared the same goal.\" </p> <p>Under the guidance of De Valois and Constant Lambert, the company began to stage an impressive repertory of new work. By 1946 the main company had moved into the Opera House, becoming the Royal Ballet in 1956, while the smaller Sadler's Wells company became Birmingham Royal Ballet in 1990. To anyone ignorant of their history, the Royal Ballet institutions now appear to rest on a weight of tradition comparable to most of the old European companies. But could anyone other than De Valois have reformed so radically the sad, bad English ballet? </p> <p>There were, of course, other people setting up companies at the same time, but none rivalled De Valois, for none had any special interest in Britain or in creating an institution that would outlive them. De Valois was a gifted dancer and choreographer, but Beryl Grey, one of the Royal's early ballerinas, remembers: \"She never pushed herself and her own work. She only ever pushed the company.\" </p> <p>There was, however, one other woman with her eye on the British ballet scene: Marie Rambert. She was neither choreographer nor dancer (though she had briefly performed in Diaghilev's corps de ballet) but she was a teacher and a visionary. In 1920, she set up her own school in London, which attracted enough talent for Rambert to stage performances at the tiny Mercury Theatre from 1926. </p> <p>Rambert certainly had a nose for genius - it was she who bullied Frederick Ashton out of his hopeless dream of dancing like Pavlova and got him making ballets - and was also a gifted, gritty director. Against brutal odds she managed to sustain her own inventive, versatile Ballet Rambert for decades, and it still survives after her death as Rambert Dance Company, directed by one of her proteg\u00e9s, Christopher Bruce. </p> <p>But most of Rambert's peers agree she was too volatile and her judgment too subjective for her to have built an enterprise as big as the Royal. She wasn't driven by the same empire-building ambitions as De Valois, nor did she possess the same rigorous organisational skills. </p> <p>Beryl Grey thinks De Valois's unique constellation of qualities made her the only woman for the job. \"She had a capacity to see ahead that is very unusual in the British. People were very much in awe of her but she could also charm the hind legs off a donkey. She had a very Irish knack for saying the right thing at the right time. Rambert didn't have that diplomacy.\" </p> <p>Other British companies began to emerge in the late 1930s and early 1940s, such as Mona Ingelsby's Ballet International, but by then the Vic-Wells was too large to be ousted. Markova also intermittently ran her own company with Anton Dolin, but it was primarily to showcase their own talents. By the time it expanded into London Festival Ballet during the 1950s, its role was to complement the Royal as a touring company outside London. </p> <p>So De Valois seems to have been the right person in the right place at the right time. But, having set out so doggedly to create this huge enterprise, how much of a personal mark did she make on it? Certainly its very Britishness is due to her. In the 1930s and 1940s, Russian ballet was considered the finest in the world and several successors to Diaghilev's company were floating around. De Valois knew she could not compete with them, which is why she insisted on nurturing home-grown dancers and choreographers. Though she employed some guest teachers from abroad, the only foreign ballets she put on before the war were the 19th-century classics, which she staged meticulously. And even after the war she brought in relatively few ballets from outside. </p> <p>De Valois's critics have argued this was a drab, parochial policy. It deprived Vic-Wells audiences of an international repertory and meant British dancers lacked the dazzle that might have rubbed off from contact with starry foreign guests. When, in 1948, Moira Shearer visited the great Russian ballerina Karsavina, who was retired in London, for some private coaching for her debut in Giselle, De Valois was livid. Her control over her company style had been breached. </p> <p>Yet even if the British style tends towards physical and emotional reticence, De Valois drilled qualities of elegance, musicality and lyricism into it that have produced dancers such as Margot Fonteyn, Antoinette Sibley, Anthony Dowell and Darcey Bussell. Also, De Valois's policy of encouraging in-house choreography has produced an extraordinary creative line - from Ashton to John Cranko, Kenneth MacMillan, David Bintley and Ashley Page. </p> <p>Though today's repertory is much more international, at its core remains a significant body of British ballets. De Valois's stable has also produced many of the UK's ballet directors, most recently Dowell at the Royal, Bintley at Birmingham, Derek Deane at English National and the late Christopher Gable at Northern. Not to mention those artists she sent abroad, helping to found state companies in Australia, South Africa and Turkey. </p> <p>So she was, truly, an empire-builder. Yet, another of the criticisms levelled against De Valois is that she never stopped being empress. The question of what Madam might have thought has, according to some, engendered an enfeebling climate of deference and nostalgia. But it has also produced a consistency other companies yearn for. </p> <p>Bintley, for one, believes that without the traditions De Valois put in place \"our companies wouldn't have lasted nor would they continue to last. We have followed a gradual process of change that has allowed us to keep pace with trends. She always said, 'One foot in the future, one foot in the past.' I think we have got it right.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "There are some characters in history who, however you turn events around, seem to have been essential to the plot. How do you tell the story of the Roman Empire without Julius Caesar? Or of modern France without Napoleon? And how do you possibly figure British ballet without Dame Ninette de Valois, who died on Thursday? This tiny woman, whose lively charm was always armoured by a military ruthlessness, surprised no one by living to the age of 102. Her tenacity and discipline were famous, and gave rise not only to nicknames - the Hockey Mistress and, most enduringly, Madam - but also to the Royal Ballet, Birmingham Royal Ballet and the Royal Ballet School, whose foundations she began masterminding in the 1920s. Most of the great European ballet companies were established centuries ago as appendages to the royal courts. British ballet was, by comparison, an end-of-pier entertainment. At the beginning of the last century most dance took place on the variety or music hall stages and most dancers scraped a training at private studios. The few who made the grade usually worked abroad, where they had to hide their ignominious origins. Alice Marks became Alicia Markova and Hilda Munnings briefly suffered the indignity of being billed as Munningsova. Edris Stannus from County Wicklow, Ireland, also changed her name - to Ninette de Valois - and, despite beginning her career with the gruesomely-named Wonder Children, was determined to escape what she called \"that sad, bad thing, the English ballet\". She patched together a serious training and in 1923 got a job dancing with Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. At the time, this was the most exciting place to be, but while most of her colleagues clung to the company until Diaghilev's death in 1929, De Valois left after only two years. She didn't want to be a star - she wanted to run her own school and create a national ballet for Britain. The story of her success is well known. After opening a dance academy in London and turning her hand to theatre, opera and ballet, she was hired by Lilian Baylis in 1931 to run a ballet ensemble (and school) at the Old Vic and Sadler's Wells. Baylis's explanation was: \"You seem to have had more experience than all these others, dear.\" But she also saw in De Valois a woman who shared her own exalted vision of a national arts scene, and who could make others see it too. Certainly, despite having no subsidy, De Valois succeeded in poaching most of the best dancers and choreographers for her new Vic-Wells company. Markova agreed to become its first ballerina, even though it meant turning down far more prestigious offers. As she recalls, she couldn't resist De Valois's call to national service. \"Dame Ninette said if we didn't put down some roots now, we'd have no ballet of our own. So I threw in my lot with her. She had that ability to make us feel we all shared the same goal.\" Under the guidance of De Valois and Constant Lambert, the company began to stage an impressive repertory of new work. By 1946 the main company had moved into the Opera House, becoming the Royal Ballet in 1956, while the smaller Sadler's Wells company became Birmingham Royal Ballet in 1990. To anyone ignorant of their history, the Royal Ballet institutions now appear to rest on a weight of tradition comparable to most of the old European companies. But could anyone other than De Valois have reformed so radically the sad, bad English ballet? There were, of course, other people setting up companies at the same time, but none rivalled De Valois, for none had any special interest in Britain or in creating an institution that would outlive them. De Valois was a gifted dancer and choreographer, but Beryl Grey, one of the Royal's early ballerinas, remembers: \"She never pushed herself and her own work. She only ever pushed the company.\" There was, however, one other woman with her eye on the British ballet scene: Marie Rambert. She was neither choreographer nor dancer (though she had briefly performed in Diaghilev's corps de ballet) but she was a teacher and a visionary. In 1920, she set up her own school in London, which attracted enough talent for Rambert to stage performances at the tiny Mercury Theatre from 1926. Rambert certainly had a nose for genius - it was she who bullied Frederick Ashton out of his hopeless dream of dancing like Pavlova and got him making ballets - and was also a gifted, gritty director. Against brutal odds she managed to sustain her own inventive, versatile Ballet Rambert for decades, and it still survives after her death as Rambert Dance Company, directed by one of her proteg\u00e9s, Christopher Bruce. But most of Rambert's peers agree she was too volatile and her judgment too subjective for her to have built an enterprise as big as the Royal. She wasn't driven by the same empire-building ambitions as De Valois, nor did she possess the same rigorous organisational skills. Beryl Grey thinks De Valois's unique constellation of qualities made her the only woman for the job. \"She had a capacity to see ahead that is very unusual in the British. People were very much in awe of her but she could also charm the hind legs off a donkey. She had a very Irish knack for saying the right thing at the right time.

      "body": "<p>A reader looks askance at the Guardian's use of akimbo. He noticed a reference on the obituaries page to the \"arms akimbo\" style of a footballer whose career was being remembered. \"I shall gently but pedantically point out,\" he said, \"that akimbo has a very specific meaning: 'with hand on hip and elbow bent outward' (my Chambers suggests that it comes from Middle English 'in kenebowe'). [And probably, according to the Concise Oxford, from Old Norse before that.] To stand with arms akimbo is to assume the position of righteous indignation or amused tolerance or anger.\" </p> <p>What the writer of the obituary clearly meant, my correspondent said, was that the footballer ran around with spread or flapping arms and not with his hands constantly on his hips. The obituarist actually wrote this: \"His arms-akimbo style led his fellow England players to nickname him Flipper.\" </p> <p>We usually get this right. Here is an example from the work of Neville Cardus, remembering a speech by George Bernard Shaw in Manchester in May 1906 (quoted in an article in the Guardian by Shaw's biographer, Michael Holroyd): \"As he stood on the platform, arms akimbo, in tweeds and still the red flame of socialism in his beard, he told us to burn down Manchester town hall and the cathedral.\" We get the picture. </p> <p>We can visualise the golfing coach David Leadbetter correctly too in this description of him: \"the Englishman, who spends his days on the world's practice ranges, arms akimbo and long legs apart in a huge inverted V, is famous for his objectivity.\" More about legs in a moment, but before that one final example of \"arms akimbo\", this time from the women's pages, that provides an almost perfect illustration of the expression: \"Think pantomime dame with arms akimbo and ballooning crinoline.\" </p> <p>The Oxford English Dictionary, still hyphenating the word as 'a-kimbo' in the rather whiskery edition I have in front of me, provides just one unequivocal definition: \"Of the arms: In a position in which the hands rest on the hips and the elbows are turned outwards.\" </p> <p>The historical examples provided by the dictionary show the progress of the word towards us down the centuries, gradually assuming its recognisable present form, beginning with this quotation from about 1400: \"The hoost... set his hond in kenebowe.\" </p> <p>It quotes Sir Thomas Urquhart from the mid-17th century: \"With gingling spurrs, and his arms a kenbol\"; Sir Richard Steele, from the Spectator of the early 18th century: \"She would clap her arms a kimbow\"; Samuel Richardson in Clarissa (1748): \"She set her huge arms akembo\"; and finally Robert Browning in 1879: \"Both arms a-kimbo.\" </p> <p>Nowhere, you will notice, is there any mention of legs. To return to my correspondent for a moment: \" 'Legs akimbo' is something that I see in your paper even more frequently [than arms akimbo]. I think this is actually very witty if you know what the word means, but I'm increasingly of the opinion that no one does. Shame.\" </p> <p>Let us have a look. Here is something that appeared in a television programme note in one of our Saturday supplements, the Guide, recently: \"The acting then takes on Eldorado proportions and [the actor] stands defiantly, legs akimbo in a proverbial force 10, pissing into it.\" One fears the worst. </p> <p>Some of the paper's finest have fallen into the trap of mistakenly believing that akimbo simply means apart. Thus a photographer finds himself \"straining over my camera with tripod legs akimbo\". Many are caught \"legs akimbo on the sofa\", among them Anne Robinson, discovered \"on her sofa in her black leather pants and her black boots and her black sleeveless T-shirt, knees up, legs akimbo\"; and Liz Hurley, \"posing in a silver lam\u00e9 bikini with legs akimbo and tongue flickering provocatively\". </p> <p> We have used it in the context of childbirth: \"Pregnant women are faced with two stark and equally unpalatable extremes: either submit legs akimbo to the stirrups...\" </p> <p>You could perhaps present an argument that some of these examples were describing legs that had assumed roughly the same shape as arms when akimbo. It does not sound very convincing, does it? </p> <p>The most interesting thing for me is the way in which this illustrates how easily we adopt into our vocabulary a word without referring to the dictionary to check its meaning. I could provide umpteen examples from the Guardian, but then so could you. But, for instance: the confusion of \"appraise\" and \"apprise\" has been annoying some of us - the first means to estimate the value or quality of something and the other means to inform, so you might certainly appraise your mum, as one columnist did recently, but you would not be apprising her of anything. </p> <p>I am digressing. My advice is to keep your arms akimbo or you won't have a leg to stand on. </p> <p>\u0095 Readers may contact the office of the readers' editor by telephoning 020-7239 9589 between 11am and 5pm, Monday to Friday.

We can visualise the golfing coach David Leadbetter correctly too in this description of him: \"the Englishman, who spends his days on the world's practice ranges, arms akimbo and long legs apart in a huge inverted V, is famous for his objectivity.\" More about legs in a moment, but before that one final example of \"arms akimbo\", this time from the women's pages, that provides an almost perfect illustration of the expression: \"Think pantomime dame with arms akimbo and ballooning crinoline.\" The Oxford English Dictionary, still hyphenating the word as 'a-kimbo' in the rather whiskery edition I have in front of me, provides just one unequivocal definition: \"Of the arms: In a position in which the hands rest on the hips and the elbows are turned outwards.\" The historical examples provided by the dictionary show the progress of the word towards us down the centuries, gradually assuming its recognisable present form, beginning with this quotation from about 1400: \"The hoost... set his hond in kenebowe.\" It quotes Sir Thomas Urquhart from the mid-17th century: \"With gingling spurrs, and his arms a kenbol\"; Sir Richard Steele, from the Spectator of the early 18th century: \"She would clap her arms a kimbow\"; Samuel Richardson in Clarissa (1748): \"She set her huge arms akembo\"; and finally Robert Browning in 1879: \"Both arms a-kimbo.\" Nowhere, you will notice, is there any mention of legs. To return to my correspondent for a moment: \" 'Legs akimbo' is something that I see in your paper even more frequently [than arms akimbo]. I think this is actually very witty if you know what the word means, but I'm increasingly of the opinion that no one does. Shame.\" Let us have a look. Here is something that appeared in a television programme note in one of our Saturday supplements, the Guide, recently: \"The acting then takes on Eldorado proportions and [the actor] stands defiantly, legs akimbo in a proverbial force 10, pissing into it.\" One fears the worst. Some of the paper's finest have fallen into the trap of mistakenly believing that akimbo simply means apart. Thus a photographer finds himself \"straining over my camera with tripod legs akimbo\". Many are caught \"legs akimbo on the sofa\", among them Anne Robinson, discovered \"on her sofa in her black leather pants and her black boots and her black sleeveless T-shirt, knees up, legs akimbo\"; and Liz Hurley, \"posing in a silver lam\u00e9 bikini with legs akimbo and tongue flickering provocatively\". We have used it in the context of childbirth: \"Pregnant women are faced with two stark and equally unpalatable extremes: either submit legs akimbo to the stirrups...\" You could perhaps present an argument that some of these examples were describing legs that had assumed roughly the same shape as arms when akimbo. It does not sound very convincing, does it? The most interesting thing for me is the way in which this illustrates how easily we adopt into our vocabulary a word without referring to the dictionary to check its meaning. I could provide umpteen examples from the Guardian, but then so could you. But, for instance: the confusion of \"appraise\" and \"apprise\" has been annoying some of us - the first means to estimate the value or quality of something and the other means to inform, so you might certainly appraise your mum, as one columnist did recently, but you would not be apprising her of anything. I am digressing. My advice is to keep your arms akimbo or you won't have a leg to stand on. \u0095 Readers may contact the office of the readers' editor by telephoning 020-7239 9589 between 11am and 5pm, Monday to Friday.

      "body": "<p>On a December morning in 1999, I entered Sony Music Studios, a squat, near windowless building on 10th Avenue. Inside, down a dimly lit corridor lined with posters of rock and rap artists, thick doors with porthole windows led into studios where large consoles with matrices of red and white lights stood next to racks full of the latest sound equipment. </p> <p>Sony Music had built their recording centre in the remains of the old 20th-Century Fox Movie-tone repository. Where dusty film canisters had once stored a weekly chronicle of the world's troubles and triumphs, four stories of state-of-the-art studios now operated: new technology rising phoenix-like from the vestiges of old. </p> <p>Four months earlier, I had written an appreciation of Miles Davis's melancholy masterpiece Kind of Blue on the 40th anniversary of its release. Now I had been granted a rare opportunity to hear the complete master tapes of the two sessions that produced the album. Sony Music - the parent company of Columbia records, which released Kind of Blue and remained Miles's record label for the majority of his career, rarely sent anyone to their subterranean archives in upstate New York or allowed the reel-to-reel tapes to be auditioned. When dealing with priceless and irreplaceable 40-year-old recordings, even the wear on the tape is a consideration. For a jazz fan like me, the occasion had the rarified, historic air of, say, the unearthing of an Egyptian tomb. </p> <p>The receptionist directed me to room 305. Equipment dedicated to sound reproduction, including a turntable in a stone base with a speed lever reading \"78 rpm,\" filled the room. Sitting amid the machines, scattered tape reels, vinyl records of varying formats and general clutter was an engineer trained in audio formats new, old and ancient. Delicately, he placed a reel of reddish-brown, half-inch ribbon on to a tape machine, manufactured expressly to play back archival three-track tapes. He paused, asked if I was ready. (Ready? I had been giddy with anticipation for weeks.) He hit the \"play\" button. </p> <p>The tape threaded its way across the playback heads and I heard the voices of Miles Davis and his producer, Irving Townsend, the instantly recognisable sound of Miles's trumpet, John Coltrane's tenor saxophone, Cannonball Adderley's alto sax and the other musicians. I listened to their harmonised riffs start and stop and grew acclimated to the rhythm of the recording process. What could I hear or intuit that would reveal the secret of that spring, when Davis assembled his famed sextet (Coltrane, Adderley, pianist Bill Evans, bassist Paul Chambers and drummer Jimmy Cobb, with pianist Wynton Kelly taking over from Evans on one number) in a converted church in downtown Manhattan? How did this band talk while creating music for the ages? Was that Coltrane's voice or Adderley's? How - if at all did they prepare? What was Miles like in the studio? Why did that take end? I had learned that the three master reels, the few rolls of black and-white film, and the less-than-distinct memories of the drummer, a photographer, and a tape operator who were in the East 30th Street studio on that day back in 1959 were about all the evidence there was of the making of the album. </p> <p>Still acknowledged as the height of hip four decades after it was recorded, Kind of Blue is the premier album of its era, jazz or otherwise. Its vapoury piano-and-bass introduction is universally recognised. Classical buffs and rage rockers alike praise its subtlety, simplicity and emotional depth. The album has sold millions of copies around the world, making it the best-selling recording in Miles Davis's catalogue and the best-selling classic jazz album ever. Significantly, a large number of those copies were purchased in the past five years, and undoubtedly not just by old-timers replacing worn vinyl: Kind of Blue is self-perpetuating, continuing to cast its spell on a younger audience more accustomed to the loud-and-fast aesthetic of rock and rap. </p> <p>The album's appeal was certainly enhanced by Miles's personal mystique. Cool, well-dressed, endlessly inspired, and uncompromising in art and life, Davis was and still is a hero to jazz fans, African Americans and the international musical community. \"Miles Davis is my definition of cool,\" Bob Dylan has said. \"I loved to see him in the small clubs playing his solo, turn his back on the crowd, put down his horn and walk off the stage, let the band keep playing, and then come back and play a few notes at the end.\" </p> <p>Davis, the second son of a well-to-do dentist in east St Louis, was seduced by jazz at an early age: </p> <p>\"I was in the sixth grade and before we went to school, there was a programme on the radio called Harlem Rhythm and I listened to it for 15 minutes - that's all it was. So I said, \"I want to play music like that.\" Duke Ellington, Jimmie Lunceford, Count Basie and other swing-era luminaries led the big bands that caught the ear of the precocious youngster, who soon started playing on a surprise gift from his uncle: a used trumpet. </p> <p>Miles discovered that his hometown had a vibrant and fertile jazz scene \"St Louis then was like a conservatory,\" he recalled, filled with talented musicians like trumpeter Clark Terry, under whose spell Miles fell. His trumpet playing improved as fellow musicians taught him the value of a vibrato-less tone and stressed the need for sight-reading. </p> <p>When, in 1944, a big band led by vocalist Billy Eckstine and featuring alto saxophonist Charlie Parker and trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie hit town, Miles was awestruck. The sounds he heard were the earliest rumblings of the bebop revolution - intense, unbridled solos rife with harmonic invention. Before the year was out he headed for New York city, ostensibly to get a musical education at the Juilliard conservatory. But when he arrived, he made a beeline for the bebop scene on 52nd Street and uptown in Harlem; that world had been his destination from the start. \"I spent my first week in New York looking for Bird and Dizzy,\" Davis recalled. </p> <p> He located his bebop heroes and began to perform with them regularly. At the start of his second year at Juilliard, he dropped out, complaining of the school's limited, classical approach to music education: \"The shit they was talking about was too white for me.\" Yet, Miles thought less of his idols for ignoring the same music. </p> <p>\"I couldn't believe that all them guys like Bird, Prez [Lester Young], Bean [Coleman Hawkins], all them cats wouldn't go to museums or libraries and borrow those musical scores so they could check out what was happening. I would go to the library and borrow scores by all those great composers, like Stravinsky, Alban Berg, Prokofiev.\" </p> <p>The pianist Bill Evans arrived at modal jazz more through his own conservatory studies (at South Eastern Louisiana University and later Mannes College of Music) than through the environment of clubs and studio dates. And it was his relationship with Davis that created the spark that resulted in Kind of Blue. </p> <p>On the surface, it would be difficult to imagine two more contrasting musicians. One had grown into a charismatic performer, comfortable and serenely confident on centre stage; the other, bookish and withdrawn by nature, held himself and his music in extremely modest regard. Whereas Davis had left the conservatory for a nightclub education, Evans had an extensive academic background in classical studies and general music theory. While Davis was riding the crest of modern jazz explorations through the mid-50s, from bebop to cool to hard bop, Evans was performing with society bands and orchestras, taking Nat \"King\" Cole's swing-based piano playing as a model. </p> <p>Despite their opposing characteristics, Davis and Evans proved to be two musical explorers bound by kindred passions and visions. Both were ardent fans of modern classical composers such as Rachmaninov and the French impressionists. In their ears, jazz and classical were two streams feeding into the same river. Miles's live-in girlfriend (and future wife), the dancer Frances Taylor, recalls that \"the music we heard at home was Khatchaturian, Ravel, Brahms, and all of that, constantly\". As related in Peter Pettinger's biography of Evans, How My Heart Sings, an old girlfriend of the pianist's remembered his daily routine: \"He would usually play classical music... Rachmaninov, Beethoven and Bach. He would play that and then just drift into jazz in a very fluid kind of way.\" </p> <p>Both Davis and Evans had also developed personal voices that, in strong contrast to the technique-driven jazz styles flowing around them, were all about pruning away excess and distilling emotion. They shared an obsessive lyricism and a melodic flow that suggested, rather than obviously defined, musical structure. Evans's rich, classical voicings on piano - uncommon in a jazz context - avoided playing the root note of a chord, thus opening up the music's harmonic possibilities. Miles's, by \"playing one note and having it relate to several chords at the same time,\" accomplished something similar from another direction. Cannonball Adderley told Ira Gitler: \"Coltrane and I call it the 'implied reference', the things Miles does.\" </p> <p>Describing the pianist's effect, the usually terse Davis said: \"Bill had this quiet fire that I loved on piano. The way he approached it, the sound he got was like crystal notes or sparkling water cascading down from some clear waterfall.\" </p> <p>The power of their collaboration is evident on the five haunting tracks of Kind of Blue but their relationship was later to be soured by arguments over authorship. Evans recalled: \"It was the first time Miles recorded an album which was largely his compositions. That morning before the date I went to his apartment. I sketched out Blue in Green, which was my tune and I sketched out the melody and the changes to it for the guys. Flamenco Sketches was something Miles and I did together.\" One musician later recalled being told by Evans of Miles's alleged response to the pianist's demand to share in the album's significant royalties: a single check for $25. </p> <p>But of the album's two recording sessions themselves, Evans had positive memories: \"There was a good feeling on those dates. But I really had no idea - I don't think anybody did - that it would have the influence and duration it did.\" </p> <p>Since the death of Davis in 1991, the legend has grown larger.

      "bodyText": "On a December morning in 1999, I entered Sony Music Studios, a squat, near windowless building on 10th Avenue. Inside, down a dimly lit corridor lined with posters of rock and rap artists, thick doors with porthole windows led into studios where large consoles with matrices of red and white lights stood next to racks full of the latest sound equipment. Sony Music had built their recording centre in the remains of the old 20th-Century Fox Movie-tone repository. Where dusty film canisters had once stored a weekly chronicle of the world's troubles and triumphs, four stories of state-of-the-art studios now operated: new technology rising phoenix-like from the vestiges of old. Four months earlier, I had written an appreciation of Miles Davis's melancholy masterpiece Kind of Blue on the 40th anniversary of its release. Now I had been granted a rare opportunity to hear the complete master tapes of the two sessions that produced the album. Sony Music - the parent company of Columbia records, which released Kind of Blue and remained Miles's record label for the majority of his career, rarely sent anyone to their subterranean archives in upstate New York or allowed the reel-to-reel tapes to be auditioned. When dealing with priceless and irreplaceable 40-year-old recordings, even the wear on the tape is a consideration. For a jazz fan like me, the occasion had the rarified, historic air of, say, the unearthing of an Egyptian tomb. The receptionist directed me to room 305. Equipment dedicated to sound reproduction, including a turntable in a stone base with a speed lever reading \"78 rpm,\" filled the room. Sitting amid the machines, scattered tape reels, vinyl records of varying formats and general clutter was an engineer trained in audio formats new, old and ancient. Delicately, he placed a reel of reddish-brown, half-inch ribbon on to a tape machine, manufactured expressly to play back archival three-track tapes. He paused, asked if I was ready. (Ready? I had been giddy with anticipation for weeks.) He hit the \"play\" button. The tape threaded its way across the playback heads and I heard the voices of Miles Davis and his producer, Irving Townsend, the instantly recognisable sound of Miles's trumpet, John Coltrane's tenor saxophone, Cannonball Adderley's alto sax and the other musicians. I listened to their harmonised riffs start and stop and grew acclimated to the rhythm of the recording process. What could I hear or intuit that would reveal the secret of that spring, when Davis assembled his famed sextet (Coltrane, Adderley, pianist Bill Evans, bassist Paul Chambers and drummer Jimmy Cobb, with pianist Wynton Kelly taking over from Evans on one number) in a converted church in downtown Manhattan? How did this band talk while creating music for the ages? Was that Coltrane's voice or Adderley's? How - if at all did they prepare? What was Miles like in the studio? Why did that take end? I had learned that the three master reels, the few rolls of black and-white film, and the less-than-distinct memories of the drummer, a photographer, and a tape operator who were in the East 30th Street studio on that day back in 1959 were about all the evidence there was of the making of the album. Still acknowledged as the height of hip four decades after it was recorded, Kind of Blue is the premier album of its era, jazz or otherwise. Its vapoury piano-and-bass introduction is universally recognised. Classical buffs and rage rockers alike praise its subtlety, simplicity and emotional depth. The album has sold millions of copies around the world, making it the best-selling recording in Miles Davis's catalogue and the best-selling classic jazz album ever. Significantly, a large number of those copies were purchased in the past five years, and undoubtedly not just by old-timers replacing worn vinyl: Kind of Blue is self-perpetuating, continuing to cast its spell on a younger audience more accustomed to the loud-and-fast aesthetic of rock and rap. The album's appeal was certainly enhanced by Miles's personal mystique. Cool, well-dressed, endlessly inspired, and uncompromising in art and life, Davis was and still is a hero to jazz fans, African Americans and the international musical community. \"Miles Davis is my definition of cool,\" Bob Dylan has said. \"I loved to see him in the small clubs playing his solo, turn his back on the crowd, put down his horn and walk off the stage, let the band keep playing, and then come back and play a few notes at the end.\" Davis, the second son of a well-to-do dentist in east St Louis, was seduced by jazz at an early age: \"I was in the sixth grade and before we went to school, there was a programme on the radio called Harlem Rhythm and I listened to it for 15 minutes - that's all it was. So I said, \"I want to play music like that.\" Duke Ellington, Jimmie Lunceford, Count Basie and other swing-era luminaries led the big bands that caught the ear of the precocious youngster, who soon started playing on a surprise gift from his uncle: a used trumpet. Miles discovered that his hometown had a vibrant and fertile jazz scene \"St Louis then was like a conservatory,\" he recalled, filled with talented musicians like trumpeter Clark Terry, under whose spell Miles fell. His trumpet playing improved as fellow musicians taught him the value of a vibrato-less tone and stressed the need for sight-reading. When, in 1944, a big band led by vocalist Billy Eckstine and featuring alto saxophonist Charlie Parker and trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie hit town, Miles was awestruck. The sounds he heard were the earliest rumblings of the bebop revolution - intense, unbridled solos rife with harmonic invention. Before the year was out he headed for New York city, ostensibly to get a musical education at the Juilliard conservatory. But when he arrived, he made a beeline for the bebop scene on 52nd Street and uptown in Harlem; that world had been his destination from the start. \"I spent my first week in New York looking for Bird and Dizzy,\" Davis recalled. He located his bebop heroes and began to perform with them regularly. At the start of his second year at Juilliard, he dropped out, complaining of the school's limited, classical approach to music education: \"The shit they was talking about was too white for me.\" Yet, Miles thought less of his idols for ignoring the same music. \"I couldn't believe that all them guys like Bird, Prez [Lester Young], Bean [Coleman Hawkins], all them cats wouldn't go to museums or libraries and borrow those musical scores so they could check out what was happening. I would go to the library and borrow scores by all those great composers, like Stravinsky, Alban Berg, Prokofiev.\" The pianist Bill Evans arrived at modal jazz more through his own conservatory studies (at South Eastern Louisiana University and later Mannes College of Music) than through the environment of clubs and studio dates. And it was his relationship with Davis that created the spark that resulted in Kind of Blue. On the surface, it would be difficult to imagine two more contrasting musicians. One had grown into a charismatic performer, comfortable and serenely confident on centre stage; the other, bookish and withdrawn by nature, held himself and his music in extremely modest regard. Whereas Davis had left the conservatory for a nightclub education, Evans had an extensive academic background in classical studies and general music theory. While Davis was riding the crest of modern jazz explorations through the mid-50s, from bebop to cool to hard bop, Evans was performing with society bands and orchestras, taking Nat \"King\" Cole's swing-based piano playing as a model. Despite their opposing characteristics, Davis and Evans proved to be two musical explorers bound by kindred passions and visions. Both were ardent fans of modern classical composers such as Rachmaninov and the French impressionists. In their ears, jazz and classical were two streams feeding into the same river. Miles's live-in girlfriend (and future wife), the dancer Frances Taylor, recalls that \"the music we heard at home was Khatchaturian, Ravel, Brahms, and all of that, constantly\". As related in Peter Pettinger's biography of Evans, How My Heart Sings, an old girlfriend of the pianist's remembered his daily routine: \"He would usually play classical music... Rachmaninov, Beethoven and Bach. He would play that and then just drift into jazz in a very fluid kind of way.\" Both Davis and Evans had also developed personal voices that, in strong contrast to the technique-driven jazz styles flowing around them, were all about pruning away excess and distilling emotion. They shared an obsessive lyricism and a melodic flow that suggested, rather than obviously defined, musical structure. Evans's rich, classical voicings on piano - uncommon in a jazz context - avoided playing the root note of a chord, thus opening up the music's harmonic possibilities. Miles's, by \"playing one note and having it relate to several chords at the same time,\" accomplished something similar from another direction. Cannonball Adderley told Ira Gitler: \"Coltrane and I call it the 'implied reference', the things Miles does.\" Describing the pianist's effect, the usually terse Davis said: \"Bill had this quiet fire that I loved on piano. The way he approached it, the sound he got was like crystal notes or sparkling water cascading down from some clear waterfall.\" The power of their collaboration is evident on the five haunting tracks of Kind of Blue but their relationship was later to be soured by arguments over authorship. Evans recalled: \"It was the first time Miles recorded an album which was largely his compositions. That morning before the date I went to his apartment. I sketched out Blue in Green, which was my tune and I sketched out the melody and the changes to it for the guys. Flamenco Sketches was something Miles and I did together.\" One musician later recalled being told by Evans of Miles's alleged response to the pianist's demand to share in the album's significant royalties: a single check for $25. But of the album's two recording sessions themselves, Evans had positive memories: \"There was a good feeling on those dates. But I really had no idea - I don't think anybody did - that it would have the influence and duration it did.\" Since the death of Davis in 1991, the legend has grown larger. But even before his passing, Kind of Blue was the recording that a vast majority called his defining masterwork. Critics revere it as a stylistic milestone. Musicians acknowledge its influence and have recorded hundreds of versions of the music on the album. Record producer, composer, and Davis confidant Quincy Jones halls it as the one album (if that were the limit) that would explain jazz. Yet Kind of Blue lives and prospers outside the confines of the jazz community. No longer the exclusive possession of a musical subculture, the album is simply great music, one of a very, very few musical recordings our culture allows into the category marked \"masterpiece\".

      "byline": "James Meek, science correspondent, in Rome",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It is a contest they are unlikely to win, and one many believe should not be waged. But amid the chaos and doubt in Rome yesterday, it was clear, at least, that Severino Antinori and his partners had fired the starting gun in a race to produce a cloned human being. </p> <p>Boasting of unlimited funds, a choice of six countries to work in and an embarrassment of scientific expertise, the Antinori private human cloning consortium set out its stall at a seminar in Rome's Institute of Clinical Obstetrics and Gynaecology. </p> <p>Or to put it another way, the consortium would not say where, when or how they would clone a human being, who would do it or how much it would cost. </p> <p>Only the fact that Mr Antinori and his colleagues work with human embryos on a daily basis in their fertility clinics and their single-minded determination to use cloning to treat one straightforward problem - male infertility - prompted the thought: What if they pulled it off? </p> <p>Mr Antinori told the seminar - 90% of the delegates were, in fact, journalists - that his clinics had already begun sounding out clients. </p> <p>Of 300 male patients whose sperm was unsuitable to produce children, he said, 70% had asked to be given the opportunity to produce a cloned child. </p> <p>\"Cloning may be the last frontier in our attempts to defeat male sterility,\" he said. \"Cloning creates ordinary children who grow up to be unique individuals. We are here to encourage fruitful scientific research and good ethical behaviour.\" </p> <p>\"We do intend to clone the first human being,\" said Panos Zavos, Mr Antinori's key partner, who runs a fertility clinic in Lexington, Kentucky. \"This is a solution to a human problem. </p> <p>\"We want to do it as soon as possible, but we have no intention of stepping over dead bodies.\" </p> <p>Later he said the first experiments to lay the groundwork for the cloning programme could begin within weeks, with the first cloned embryo ready for implantation in a mother's womb within one and a half to two years. </p> <p>He ruled out using the technology to try to clone dead children or famous people. The idea was to help men who had no sperm to have genetically related children without relying on a sperm donor. </p> <p>\"It's a dead-end street, it's a stop sign, if you're one of those males that face this particular difficulty, you think: 'God, why me? Why do I have to borrow sperm in order to get a child?'\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Zavos added that, unlike animal cloning programmes, they would not be implanting scores of embryos in many surrogate mothers in the hope of getting one successful pregnancy. </p> <p>Twenty-three years of human IVF work had laid the basis for a more sophisticated approach, he said, involving screening embryos at the stage when they consisted of only a few cells to select the most likely to implant successfully, cultivating extra embryos from the best, and then implanting them in one mother. </p> <p>The appearance of a third partner on the platform, Avi Ben Abraham, described as an Israeli-American biotechnologist, prompted speculation that the \"Mediterranean country\" referred to as a possible site for the first human cloning attempt was Israel. But the consortium would not be drawn. </p> <p>If the organisation of yesterday's seminar was anything to go by, would-be clonees would be advised to look elsewhere. In the cramped well of a dingy lecture theatre, the animated, silver-haired Mr Antinori and assistants beat off waves of camera crews and photographers as they made their presentations. </p> <p>At one point a man in a white coat entered and announced that the head of the department which ran the lecture theatre had been watching the seminar with mounting horror on CNN during a trip to China and strongly objected to an event supporting human cloning - condemned by the UN, the EU, the Council of Europe, the World Health Organisation and a catalogue of other bodies. </p> <p>Towards the end, the hulking, bearded figure of Richard Seed, an early, discredited prophet of human cloning, unexpectedly took the floor. His last words before his microphone was cut off and he was led away were: \"I'm going to try to clone my wife first. I'm going to try to keep the first five clones in the family - \" </p> <p>Real cloning is seen as lying in the realms of science. For now, it does. But the equipment and know-how required to at tempt to clone a human being is cheap and simple compared to that needed for a nuclear weapon or to put an astronaut in space. </p> <p>Reproductive human cloning is not technically illegal in Britain, but the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority would certainly refuse permission. However, while some US states and countries, such as Japan, have banned it outright, others have not, and there are now few parts of the world without IVF centres: China, India and the former Soviet Union have many. </p> <p>The science of human cloning is much tougher. All labs which have succeeded in cloning animals report a massive failure rate, from embryos failing to implant in wombs to miscarriages and deformities at birth. </p> <p>The only lab in the world to have successfully cloned an animal from the family to which humans belong, the primates, told the Guardian this week that it had given up further attempts until it understood what was going wrong. </p> <p>The Oregon Regional Primate Centre, which recently announced the birth of ANDi, the world's first genetically modified monkey, has never managed to clone a monkey using the Dolly technique, where an embryo is cultured from an adult cell. It has only ever done it with an older method, using a single cell from a natural embryo. </p> <p>The centre's Don Wolf said: \"I think it's ridiculous to venture into the realm of human reproductive cloning. The risks are clearly unacceptable.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is a contest they are unlikely to win, and one many believe should not be waged. But amid the chaos and doubt in Rome yesterday, it was clear, at least, that Severino Antinori and his partners had fired the starting gun in a race to produce a cloned human being. Boasting of unlimited funds, a choice of six countries to work in and an embarrassment of scientific expertise, the Antinori private human cloning consortium set out its stall at a seminar in Rome's Institute of Clinical Obstetrics and Gynaecology. Or to put it another way, the consortium would not say where, when or how they would clone a human being, who would do it or how much it would cost. Only the fact that Mr Antinori and his colleagues work with human embryos on a daily basis in their fertility clinics and their single-minded determination to use cloning to treat one straightforward problem - male infertility - prompted the thought: What if they pulled it off? Mr Antinori told the seminar - 90% of the delegates were, in fact, journalists - that his clinics had already begun sounding out clients. Of 300 male patients whose sperm was unsuitable to produce children, he said, 70% had asked to be given the opportunity to produce a cloned child. \"Cloning may be the last frontier in our attempts to defeat male sterility,\" he said. \"Cloning creates ordinary children who grow up to be unique individuals. We are here to encourage fruitful scientific research and good ethical behaviour.\" \"We do intend to clone the first human being,\" said Panos Zavos, Mr Antinori's key partner, who runs a fertility clinic in Lexington, Kentucky. \"This is a solution to a human problem. \"We want to do it as soon as possible, but we have no intention of stepping over dead bodies.\" Later he said the first experiments to lay the groundwork for the cloning programme could begin within weeks, with the first cloned embryo ready for implantation in a mother's womb within one and a half to two years. He ruled out using the technology to try to clone dead children or famous people. The idea was to help men who had no sperm to have genetically related children without relying on a sperm donor. \"It's a dead-end street, it's a stop sign, if you're one of those males that face this particular difficulty, you think: 'God, why me? Why do I have to borrow sperm in order to get a child?'\" he said. Mr Zavos added that, unlike animal cloning programmes, they would not be implanting scores of embryos in many surrogate mothers in the hope of getting one successful pregnancy. Twenty-three years of human IVF work had laid the basis for a more sophisticated approach, he said, involving screening embryos at the stage when they consisted of only a few cells to select the most likely to implant successfully, cultivating extra embryos from the best, and then implanting them in one mother. The appearance of a third partner on the platform, Avi Ben Abraham, described as an Israeli-American biotechnologist, prompted speculation that the \"Mediterranean country\" referred to as a possible site for the first human cloning attempt was Israel. But the consortium would not be drawn. If the organisation of yesterday's seminar was anything to go by, would-be clonees would be advised to look elsewhere. In the cramped well of a dingy lecture theatre, the animated, silver-haired Mr Antinori and assistants beat off waves of camera crews and photographers as they made their presentations. At one point a man in a white coat entered and announced that the head of the department which ran the lecture theatre had been watching the seminar with mounting horror on CNN during a trip to China and strongly objected to an event supporting human cloning - condemned by the UN, the EU, the Council of Europe, the World Health Organisation and a catalogue of other bodies. Towards the end, the hulking, bearded figure of Richard Seed, an early, discredited prophet of human cloning, unexpectedly took the floor. His last words before his microphone was cut off and he was led away were: \"I'm going to try to clone my wife first. I'm going to try to keep the first five clones in the family - \" Real cloning is seen as lying in the realms of science. For now, it does. But the equipment and know-how required to at tempt to clone a human being is cheap and simple compared to that needed for a nuclear weapon or to put an astronaut in space. Reproductive human cloning is not technically illegal in Britain, but the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority would certainly refuse permission. However, while some US states and countries, such as Japan, have banned it outright, others have not, and there are now few parts of the world without IVF centres: China, India and the former Soviet Union have many. The science of human cloning is much tougher. All labs which have succeeded in cloning animals report a massive failure rate, from embryos failing to implant in wombs to miscarriages and deformities at birth. The only lab in the world to have successfully cloned an animal from the family to which humans belong, the primates, told the Guardian this week that it had given up further attempts until it understood what was going wrong. The Oregon Regional Primate Centre, which recently announced the birth of ANDi, the world's first genetically modified monkey, has never managed to clone a monkey using the Dolly technique, where an embryo is cultured from an adult cell. It has only ever done it with an older method, using a single cell from a natural embryo. The centre's Don Wolf said: \"I think it's ridiculous to venture into the realm of human reproductive cloning. The risks are clearly unacceptable.\"",

There was absolutely nothing in it that hadn't already been said.\" The spokesman pointed out that shares in Amazon had actually risen in value on the day Mr Suria's most recent report was published. \"The company was aware of the report but whether Jeff saw it I don't know,\" he added. The US regulator declined to comment on whether it had instigated an investigation. Last year it pursued 40 actions related to insider trading. It would need to prove that an individual acted on information that would have a material effect on a share price before it become public. Mr Bezos, an internet pioneer, whose fortune ran to $8bn at the company's peak, is a role model for the get rich quick e-generation. His father came to the US from Havana in the early 1960s as part of a humanitarian effort to \"rescue\" young people from Cuba and arrived unable to speak English. Amazon, launched by Mr Bezos in July 1995, has become the best known of the online retailers. But it has been unable to escape the turmoil which has battered the dot.com sector in the past year. Amazon shares, worth more than $70 a piece 12 months ago, are now worth less than $12 each. Mr Bezos, who still owns about one-third of the company, has seen his worth shrink to around $1.3bn. At the end of January, the online retailer announced plans to cut 1,300 staff - 15% of its workforce - and warned that sales in the coming year would be 10% lower than previously forecast. The company's quarterly results showed that sales in its core books, CDs and videos segment are slowing dramatically to growth of just 11%.",

      "bodyText": "Gamblers and those who like a drink enjoyed a Budget boost this week, but there wasn't much in Gordon Brown's red box for savers and investors. There was some good news with the widening of the 10p income tax band, but the Chancellor was accused of missing a huge opportunity to give people more control over the way they can use their pension fund money when they retire. And he also rejected calls for a cut in stamp duty on small share purchases by private investors. The rules have been changed to allow people to tuck more money away in tax-free Isa accounts - but we already knew about that, as it was fully announced in the November pre-Budget report. And while Mr Brown endorsed a report issued this week, whose recommendations will encourage pension funds to invest in a wider range of companies, hopefully spelling higher returns, this will not give immediate benefits. The Chancellor's lack of interest in savers is surprising because personal savings are at a worryingly low level. Recent official figures show that consumers are saving less of their incomes now than at any time in the past 12 years. So what was - and wasn't - in the Budget for savers and investors? Annuities It wasn't mentioned in Gordon's speech or in the sheaf of Budget press releases, but buried deep in one of the thick Treasury documents was the news that the government has rejected calls to reform the rules that force people to buy an annuity with their pension savings when they retire. That is a huge blow to many thousands of people approaching retirement who are dreading the moment they will have to convert their hard-earned pension fund into an annuity - which will provide them with an income for the rest of their life. The very small consolation was that the government says it is keen to enable those buying annuities to make better-informed decisions and that it will look at what can be done to encourage more people to shop around for their annuity rather than simply taking the one offered by their pension company. At the moment everyone with a personal pension or who belongs to a money purchase company scheme must use most of their pension fund to buy an annuity by the age of 75. Annuity rates have plummeted in recent years because of falling interest rates and because people are living longer. The best level annuity rate currently available for a 65-year-old man is around 8%-9%, compared to a decade ago when they were at 14%-16%. That means a 65-year-old man with a \u00a3100,000 pension pot is looking at an income of, at best, \u00a39,000 a year. It has been suggested that people should only be required to buy an annuity large enough to keep them above the state support threshold, leaving them free to use the rest of their money in other ways. But the Treasury rejected such ideas as being too expensive. This left campaigners fuming. Former Labour MP Dr Oonagh McDonald, director of the Retirement Income Reform Campaign, says: \"I very much regret that Gordon Brown has not taken this opportunity to reform the unfair rules. Over 1m working people, having saved prudently throughout their working lives, will suffer.\" 10p rate of income tax gives a boost Around 1m savers, many of them pensioners, will benefit from the widening of the 10p income tax band, which will apply to savings income. The Chancellor has extended the 10p starting rate of income tax by \u00a3300 to the first \u00a31,880 of earnings. But those people benefiting will now have the hassle of reclaiming some of the tax that's automatically deducted from their savings. Isas As announced in the pre-Budget report, the annual limit of \u00a37,000 on the amount people can invest in Isas will be kept for a further five years, until April 2006. It had been due to drop to \u00a35,000 next month. Also, as announced, 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds will be allowed to open cash Isas, extending tax-free saving to 100,000 under-18s who work and pay tax, and the rules for Peps will come into line with those for Isas, giving Pep holders access to a wider range of investment opportunities. Stamp duty on share deals There were rumours that the Chancellor might halve or even abolish stamp duty on share buying, but these came to nothing. That means investors will continue to pay 0.5% stamp duty on share purchases. This lack of action was widely condemned. IFA BestInvest says this tax makes the UK one of the most expensive places to deal in Europe, while stockbroker TD Waterhouse says: \"Even though the government is encouraging individuals to make their own investments for the future, it is still taxing people for doing so.\" Encouraging those on low incomes to save The government says it will be consulting with the financial services industry on further ways of encouraging people on low and moderate incomes to save. It revealed it might consider launching a new type of account where the money an individual puts in is matched by a contribution from the State. These are known as Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) and already operate in America. There, IDAs typically encourage the less well-off to save for a specific purpose, such as buying a home, by matching the money they put in with a contribution from public or private funds.",

      "body": "<p>Fears about a slowdown in sales yesterday knocked the froth off fast-growing JD Wetherspoon, which now runs 470 pubs. Shares lost 56.5p to 347.5p as chairman Tim Martin announced underlying sales in February up just 3.1% on last year's levels. In February 2000 growth was running at 14%. </p> <p>Mr Martin has been warning the City of a slowdown in growth for some time, but yesterday said that March sales had picked up. </p> <p>The share price reaction wiped more than \u00a3100m off the value of the group, however, which had been a favourite among many City analysts. The shares had outperformed the stock market by 21% over the past 12 months. </p> <p>Mr Martin - who has a 15% stake in the group worth more than \u00a3110m - said he was unconcerned about the City's reaction: \"I'm not an expert in shares. I always try to ignore the share price as much as I can. It has its ups and downs and I believe the business is stronger than it has ever been\". </p> <p>He was announcing half-year profits up 31% at \u00a320.5m and a 10% increase in the dividend payout to 1.0p. The February sales slowdown came after 6.5% growth in the half-year to the end of January, which included a 10% increase in Christmas business. </p> <p>\"The like-for-like sales slowdown brings the group close to the industry norm,\" said analyst Nigel Popham at Teather &amp; Greenwood. Mr Popham has rated the shares a \"sell\" for some time as he regards them as expensive in a mature market. </p> <p>Mr Martin said the group's margins had been hit by two promotions - offering coffee at 49p instead of 99p and a \"beer and a burger\" for \u00a32.99.

      "bodyText": "Fears about a slowdown in sales yesterday knocked the froth off fast-growing JD Wetherspoon, which now runs 470 pubs. Shares lost 56.5p to 347.5p as chairman Tim Martin announced underlying sales in February up just 3.1% on last year's levels. In February 2000 growth was running at 14%. Mr Martin has been warning the City of a slowdown in growth for some time, but yesterday said that March sales had picked up. The share price reaction wiped more than \u00a3100m off the value of the group, however, which had been a favourite among many City analysts. The shares had outperformed the stock market by 21% over the past 12 months. Mr Martin - who has a 15% stake in the group worth more than \u00a3110m - said he was unconcerned about the City's reaction: \"I'm not an expert in shares. I always try to ignore the share price as much as I can. It has its ups and downs and I believe the business is stronger than it has ever been\". He was announcing half-year profits up 31% at \u00a320.5m and a 10% increase in the dividend payout to 1.0p. The February sales slowdown came after 6.5% growth in the half-year to the end of January, which included a 10% increase in Christmas business. \"The like-for-like sales slowdown brings the group close to the industry norm,\" said analyst Nigel Popham at Teather &amp; Greenwood. Mr Popham has rated the shares a \"sell\" for some time as he regards them as expensive in a mature market. Mr Martin said the group's margins had been hit by two promotions - offering coffee at 49p instead of 99p and a \"beer and a burger\" for \u00a32.99. He was particularly pleased with the coffee campaign, which doubled the number of cups sold to 400 per pub per week. He is now considering opening his pubs early to try to steal business from the likes of Starbucks and Costa coffee. \"We want their business bad,\" he said. Wetherspoons is also intending to start promoting more local ales. \"We are pushing ahead with more traditional ales from small brewers, which are a neglected area,\" said Mr Martin. He hit out at the decision by the big brewers to increase their prices this month - a move which could put 6p-10p on the price of a pint at the bar. Scottish Courage prices went up 2.5% last Monday and Bass plans a 2.8% price rise on March 25. He said: \"I don't think it was very clever of them to put up prices just after the chancellor has said he is freezing the duty. It is not the most brilliant marketing ploy.\" Wetherspoons, which specialises in turning old supermarkets, cinemas and garages into pubs, plans to open up to 100 pubs a year.",

      "bodyText": "Ukrainian riot police used teargas and truncheons yesterday against thousands of protesters hurling stones and bottles at the presidential administration building and demanding the resignation of President Leonid Kuchma. The police said as many as 18,000 people joined the protest in the capital, Kiev, in the course of the day, making it the biggest and most violent of the present political crisis. As night fell vicious fighting broke out between demonstrators from the Ukraine Without Kuchma movement and the chain of police officers defending the building. \"Fascists! Fascists! Kuchma out! Kuchma out!\" the crowd chanted as a core of 100 demonstrators repeatedly hurled themselves at the police. Teargas canisters were picked up and thrown back at the police, and the crowd cheered after one officer's tear-gas gun exploded in his hands. \"Look, look, look at this, Ukrainian blood spilled by Ukrainians,\" one woman yelled, brandishing a bloodstained handkerchief at the police during a lull in the battle. The protesters, 70 of whom were arrested according to the police, accused Mr Kuchma of being involved in the murder of the journalist Georgy Gongadze, whose headless corpse was found outside Kiev last year. In November an opposition leader produced audio tapes on which the president's voice could be heard telling subordinates to \"deal with\" the reporter. Mr Kuchma denies being involved is his death and claims that the tapes have been doctored. The investigation of Gongadze's death has made little progress. Witnesses in the capital saw police officers beat demonstrators on the legs and heads, while protesters with home-made truncheons injured several officers, some seriously. The windows of buses and cars were smashed as the crowd moved through the city. The demonstration was timed to disrupt the celebration of the 187th birthday of Ukraine's most famous poet, Taras Shevchenko. The demonstrators failed to stop Mr Kuchma laying a wreath at the poet's grave in the morning, but they later removed and destroyed it: an opposition leader said it was an act of \"symbolic cleansing\". Mr Kuchma, who left the city after the wreath-laying to survey the floods that have swept through the country this week, said: \"If all the money that has been spent on political actions was sent here, then people would be much better off.\" Despite the protests, political analysts doubt that Mr Kuchma will be toppled soon. They point to his tough grip on the government and his skill in exploiting and facing down the less-than-united opposition.",

After leaving the smoking Popocatepetl volcano far in the distance, the caravan is visiting the places where Zapata was born, was killed, and from which he launched his triumphant entrance into Mexico City in 1914. This march, which also aspires to a triumphant entrance to the capital, was begun by the Zapatistas after Vicente Fox made a peace offer to the rebels one of his first acts as president. The marchers want all Zapatistas held prisoner since their Chiapas uprising began in 1994 released, troops withdrawn from the state, and a bill guaranteeing political and cultural rights to the 10m indigenous Mexicans, the \"poorest of the poor\" in a country of 100m.

      "bodyText": "An emotional funeral gathering of farmers and opposition members heard a Presbyterian minister call down a curse on President Robert Mugabe's government yesterday in this town in southern Zimbabwe. The occasion was the service for Gloria Olds, the white farmer murdered earlier this week. She is the latest casualty of the movement to take over white farms, takeovers which the supreme court has ruled are illegal but the government encourages. Sincethat ruling the chief justice has been forced into early retirement, and yesterday it was announced that his successor was to be a Mugabe ally, Judge Godfrey Chidyausiku, 54, a former deputy minister. Olds's elder son Martin was killed last year. At yesterday's service the Rev Paul Adrianatos said: \"For those responsible for the murders of Gloria and Martin Olds, I pray that they be cursed.\" \"For officials and cabinet ministers who ignore and act against just laws, I pray for your curse. For the leaders of this country who are not honest, sincere and have compassion for the people, I pray that they be removed or cursed.\" Mr Adrianatos is to leave Zimbabwe this weekend, because officials have refused to renew his work permit. He criticised the inertia of the police after Olds's murder on Sunday. \"They said they could not come because they had no transport. No police roadblocks were set up.\" Olds stayed on the family farm after her son was murdered last April by members of the \"war veterans\" movement, which is leading the incursion on white farms. She shot in the legs while doing her early morning chores. According to forensic investigators, she tried to crawl to her truck. Two killers with AK-47 automatic rifles followed her, shot her three dogs, and then riddled her with bullets. Olds's son was killed when more than 70 members of the veterans group, which supports Mr Mugabe's Zanu-PF party, surrounded the farmhouse and engaged in a five-hour gun battle. Martin Olds was known as a supporter of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). Yesterday's service was attended by 250 members of the white farming community, including Olds's younger son David and his family, also farmers, and black and white supporters of the MDC. Opposition figures said the government was intensifying its repression in the surrounding Matabeleland, an area of MDC strength. David Coltart, the MDC MP for Bulawayo North, who has received death threats, emerged from hiding to be at the funeral, entering the church by a back door. \"There is no doubt the killing was carried out by government supporters,\" he said. \"The ammunition which killed Gloria Olds can be traced back to the government, according to experts who investigated the site. \"By murdering Gloria Olds in such a brutal way, the government is trying to intimidate the farming community and to get them to give up.\" He accused the local governor, Obert Mpofu, of making statements inciting violence against white farmers. He also accused two Mugabe allies, Border Gezi, the minister for youth and employment creation, and the war veterans' leader, Chenjerai Hunzvi, of encouraging more political violence when they visited Matabeleland two weeks ago. An MDC official, Eddie Cross, said: \"The central intelligence organisation has gone house to house in Victoria Falls and other centres, beating people suspected of supporting the MDC. Farmers have seen increased aggression and death threats.\" He had \"no doubt\" that Olds was executed by the CIO or the army.",

      "body": "<p>M\u00e1rio Covas,who has died of multiple organ failure aged 70 was a giant of Brazilian politics and favourite choice for the Brazilian presidency until his protracted and very public battle with the cancer that led to his death. In 1986, Covas, an architect of Brazil's return from dictatorship to democracy during the 1980s, received what is still the record number of votes for a senator.</p> <p>Since 1994 he had been governor of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil's richest, most populous state. It was only when his health deteriorated dramatically recently that power was transferred to his deputy.</p> <p>Covas stood out in Brazilian politics as a combative, hardworking administrator who preferred to balance books rather than overspend on populist projects. This won him wide-ranging, cross-party respect although the austerity measures he often had to adopt because of his predecessors' profligacy deprived him of popular affection.</p> <p>Unlike many Brazilian politicians at his level, who often acquire unexplained fortunes in office and who readily switch convictions and parties, Covas neither personally profited from his positions nor deviated from his centrist political principles. He was a hard-talking, stubborn orator and, as the left-wing leader Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva observed, Covas was an example of ethical behaviour, dignity, morality, and of a man who kept his promises.</p> <p>One of the seven founders of the Brazilian Social Democratic Party (PSDB) in1988, Covas was its candidate for president the following year - the first direct elections for president since the end of the 1964-85 dictatorship.

      "bodyText": "M\u00e1rio Covas,who has died of multiple organ failure aged 70 was a giant of Brazilian politics and favourite choice for the Brazilian presidency until his protracted and very public battle with the cancer that led to his death. In 1986, Covas, an architect of Brazil's return from dictatorship to democracy during the 1980s, received what is still the record number of votes for a senator. Since 1994 he had been governor of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil's richest, most populous state. It was only when his health deteriorated dramatically recently that power was transferred to his deputy. Covas stood out in Brazilian politics as a combative, hardworking administrator who preferred to balance books rather than overspend on populist projects. This won him wide-ranging, cross-party respect although the austerity measures he often had to adopt because of his predecessors' profligacy deprived him of popular affection. Unlike many Brazilian politicians at his level, who often acquire unexplained fortunes in office and who readily switch convictions and parties, Covas neither personally profited from his positions nor deviated from his centrist political principles. He was a hard-talking, stubborn orator and, as the left-wing leader Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva observed, Covas was an example of ethical behaviour, dignity, morality, and of a man who kept his promises. One of the seven founders of the Brazilian Social Democratic Party (PSDB) in1988, Covas was its candidate for president the following year - the first direct elections for president since the end of the 1964-85 dictatorship. Campaigning on a platform that argued for a \"capitalist shock\", he came fourth. However, after the resignation of President Fernado Collor in a corruption scandal in 1992, the PSDB finally won the presidency in 1994 with Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who was re-elected in 1998.

      "trailText": "<p>Russia's ageing and accident-prone space station is days away from a fiery end and a watery grave.</p>",
      "byline": "Tim Radford, science editor",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In about 10 days - it depends on the weather in space - a season of high drama should come to both a fiery end and a watery grave. Three puffs of fuel from a Progress rocket will pull the 130-tonne Russian space station Mir down to its last orbit. A fourth will send it careering half-way round the globe to burn up in the atmosphere and then put out its blazing embers in the emptiest quarter of the Pacific Ocean. Just in case anything goes wrong the Russians have taken out a \u00a3135m accident insurance policy. </p> <p>If something goes badly wrong and Mir plunges into Britain, the Home Office is prepared and police and local authorities are ready to put emergency plans into action. But there is probably greater nervousness among the 16 nations of the South Pacific Forum, where many homes are made out of grass, corrugated iron and wood, and where some of the 40-plus tonnes of space hardware expected to survive the re-entry could cause extensive damage. </p> <p>Mir was designed for five years in space but stayed in orbit for 15. It circled the world every 92 minutes, and it provided hotel and workshop facilities for almost 100 visitors. Its life-support system recovered oxygen from cosmonaut urine and turned cosmonaut perspiration into drinking water. Its air-conditioning system removed the toxic chemicals from what the Russians politely termed \"human gases\" and discarded them into space. </p> <p>But it was accident prone. Mir survived blocked lavatories, a fire, a collision with one of its own supply ships, an oxygen crisis and a series of computer shutdowns. It tested military technology during the Cold War but after the collapse of the Soviet Union the cosmonauts on board turned swords into ploughshares and grew wheat in space, as a kind of dress rehearsal for some future voyage to Mars. </p> <p>Mir evolved into a remarkable experiment in space endurance and one engineer spent 747 days on board, in three separate missions. A record. The space station became, briefly, private property, leased to an international commercial outfit called Mircorp. In the end, it grew rotten, infested by fungus, just like any other old house with damp. The last cosmonauts and their American colleagues aboard were spending 80% of their time trying to keep the old crate in working order. The end had come. </p> <p>Right now, Mir is hanging, with its heaviest part downwards, revolving twice an hour about 140 miles above the planet, a Progress rocket laden with 2.7 tonnes of fuel sticking out like a little stubby tail. This tail is about to wag the dog goodbye. </p> <p>The end could come at any time between March 18 and March 25, due to weather problems in space: the sun is at its maximum in its 11-year-cycle, and a series of million-mile-an-hour showers of hot particles from the sun have been heating up the Earth's atmosphere, making it expand and, in effect, reach up to Mir and drag it down a little, which affects the timetable. </p> <p>At present the most likely date of doom is March 20. With a series of burns from the Progress rocket, ground control in Moscow will distort its orbit into an ellipse: 140 miles at its highest, 110 miles at its lowest. Then they will wait for the ideal orbital track and choose their moment. At some point over the equatorial Atlantic, as Mir heads north over the planet, controllers will press the button and send it into an orbit with its lowest point at 40 miles altitude. This is an orbit Mir will never complete. The huge space station will travel half-way round the planet to begin its dive over heavily populated Europe and Asia, although most of it will perish over the empty south seas. </p> <p>Over the past 43 years, a total of 18,000 tracked objects have returned from space. There has never been a human casualty. At five miles a second (about 17,500 mph) Mir will dive into the atmosphere and start to slow down dramatically. At 86 miles altitude, aerodynamic torque will start to increase. By 75 miles, the fate of Mir will be sealed. At 62 miles altitude its solar panels will begin to bend; at 50 miles the solar arrays will tear off. At 37 miles the sturdier parts of Mir will have heated up to 30,000C before bursting apart. The space station will continue to dive; not so much like a large, ungainly bomber, but like a formation of blazing fighters. </p> <p>At 25 miles, Mir's fragments should have slowed to a terminal velocity of about 125 mph and may reach the Earth's surface. Most of the US Skylab perished upon re-entry over the Indian Ocean in 1979, but some large lumps of titanium did landed in Western Australia. Fragments of Soviet Cosmos 954's nuclear reactor were strewn over northern Canada after its re-entry a year before. </p> <p>\"From past experience a number of orbital objects do find their way back to Earth,\" says Richard Crowther, a space scientist. \"They tend to be circular or cylindrical in shape. They tend to spin as they come into the atmosphere, so they dissipate heat, and distribute it over their surface, so there is no heat concentration. But the damage is extremely local. There are no fires, there are no craters. It just falls to Earth.\" </p> <p>In fact, nothing should fall to Earth, just ocean. Mir's ocean landing will be along a 3,700-mile track of the southern Pacific Ocean, 125 miles wide, on either side of latitude 47S.

      "bodyText": "In about 10 days - it depends on the weather in space - a season of high drama should come to both a fiery end and a watery grave. Three puffs of fuel from a Progress rocket will pull the 130-tonne Russian space station Mir down to its last orbit. A fourth will send it careering half-way round the globe to burn up in the atmosphere and then put out its blazing embers in the emptiest quarter of the Pacific Ocean. Just in case anything goes wrong the Russians have taken out a \u00a3135m accident insurance policy. If something goes badly wrong and Mir plunges into Britain, the Home Office is prepared and police and local authorities are ready to put emergency plans into action. But there is probably greater nervousness among the 16 nations of the South Pacific Forum, where many homes are made out of grass, corrugated iron and wood, and where some of the 40-plus tonnes of space hardware expected to survive the re-entry could cause extensive damage. Mir was designed for five years in space but stayed in orbit for 15. It circled the world every 92 minutes, and it provided hotel and workshop facilities for almost 100 visitors. Its life-support system recovered oxygen from cosmonaut urine and turned cosmonaut perspiration into drinking water. Its air-conditioning system removed the toxic chemicals from what the Russians politely termed \"human gases\" and discarded them into space. But it was accident prone. Mir survived blocked lavatories, a fire, a collision with one of its own supply ships, an oxygen crisis and a series of computer shutdowns. It tested military technology during the Cold War but after the collapse of the Soviet Union the cosmonauts on board turned swords into ploughshares and grew wheat in space, as a kind of dress rehearsal for some future voyage to Mars. Mir evolved into a remarkable experiment in space endurance and one engineer spent 747 days on board, in three separate missions. A record. The space station became, briefly, private property, leased to an international commercial outfit called Mircorp. In the end, it grew rotten, infested by fungus, just like any other old house with damp. The last cosmonauts and their American colleagues aboard were spending 80% of their time trying to keep the old crate in working order. The end had come. Right now, Mir is hanging, with its heaviest part downwards, revolving twice an hour about 140 miles above the planet, a Progress rocket laden with 2.7 tonnes of fuel sticking out like a little stubby tail. This tail is about to wag the dog goodbye. The end could come at any time between March 18 and March 25, due to weather problems in space: the sun is at its maximum in its 11-year-cycle, and a series of million-mile-an-hour showers of hot particles from the sun have been heating up the Earth's atmosphere, making it expand and, in effect, reach up to Mir and drag it down a little, which affects the timetable. At present the most likely date of doom is March 20. With a series of burns from the Progress rocket, ground control in Moscow will distort its orbit into an ellipse: 140 miles at its highest, 110 miles at its lowest. Then they will wait for the ideal orbital track and choose their moment. At some point over the equatorial Atlantic, as Mir heads north over the planet, controllers will press the button and send it into an orbit with its lowest point at 40 miles altitude. This is an orbit Mir will never complete. The huge space station will travel half-way round the planet to begin its dive over heavily populated Europe and Asia, although most of it will perish over the empty south seas. Over the past 43 years, a total of 18,000 tracked objects have returned from space. There has never been a human casualty. At five miles a second (about 17,500 mph) Mir will dive into the atmosphere and start to slow down dramatically. At 86 miles altitude, aerodynamic torque will start to increase. By 75 miles, the fate of Mir will be sealed. At 62 miles altitude its solar panels will begin to bend; at 50 miles the solar arrays will tear off. At 37 miles the sturdier parts of Mir will have heated up to 30,000C before bursting apart. The space station will continue to dive; not so much like a large, ungainly bomber, but like a formation of blazing fighters. At 25 miles, Mir's fragments should have slowed to a terminal velocity of about 125 mph and may reach the Earth's surface. Most of the US Skylab perished upon re-entry over the Indian Ocean in 1979, but some large lumps of titanium did landed in Western Australia. Fragments of Soviet Cosmos 954's nuclear reactor were strewn over northern Canada after its re-entry a year before. \"From past experience a number of orbital objects do find their way back to Earth,\" says Richard Crowther, a space scientist. \"They tend to be circular or cylindrical in shape. They tend to spin as they come into the atmosphere, so they dissipate heat, and distribute it over their surface, so there is no heat concentration. But the damage is extremely local. There are no fires, there are no craters. It just falls to Earth.\" In fact, nothing should fall to Earth, just ocean. Mir's ocean landing will be along a 3,700-mile track of the southern Pacific Ocean, 125 miles wide, on either side of latitude 47S. There are no inhabited islands and local shipping will have been warned. Mir's last moments will be tracked by the Russians and by western control centres used during the Cold War, among them the command post at Cheyenne Mountain in the US Rockies, and the radar tracking station at Fylingdales in North Yorkshire. An aircraft has even been chartered, to take sightseers to observe Mir's last moments. But the betting is that the only mourners will be the Russians, as they watch a symbol of their former space supremacy perform its very own vanishing trick. Russia's new space platform is the International Space Station, mostly built and run by the American space agency, Nasa. \"We can't hold on to what is old. We need to move forward,\" said Leonid Gorshkov, one of the Mir space station's designers. Roald Sagdeev, a leading figure in Soviet space research for many years, said: \"Mir outlived not only the original manufacturer's warranty, but also its parent state, the USSR, by 10 years _ Mir has finally become a liability.\"",

The Saatchi Gallery in Hampstead has until Monday to remove her pictures from the I Am A Camera exhibition, or risk prosecution.</p> <p>The argument over her photographs rests on two key judgments: intent and consent. On the question of the effect the artist wanted the images to have, there's clearly a difference between Gearon's work and the snaps of naked children posed and posted on the internet or printed in magazines in the Netherlands. The latter have a paedophile intention; the former may have a paedophile effect.</p> <p>The distinction is that the works on display at the Saatchi began in innocence as the family snaps of a mother. Gearon was not a professional photographer until last year. No sane person would suggest that she knowingly set out to expose her children to the gaze of pederasts in Manhattan and Hampstead. But because the mother with the camera was, in this case, an artist, she must accept - as all creative people are forced to acknowledge - that there may be in the work a psychological drive of which she is unaware. The photos are clearly intended to explore the borders between childhood and adulthood - the seeds of sexuality within a child - and it's possible that Gearon went further over the border than she mapped out.</p> <p>She must also accept that images intended innocently can be put to abusive uses. Blue Peter's viewers almost certainly include some - middle-aged single men living with their mothers - who are tuning in for the wrong reasons, but the BBC could not reasonably be accused of encouraging paedophilia through its scheduling of children's programmes.</p> <p>Even so, a weakness for Gearon in the defence of unintentional interpretation is the nature of the images. In the present climate of parental and newspaper neurosis, it's unlikely that Blue Peter would run a competition for the best home video of children playing in a paddling pool, purely because of the risk of a round of one-handed applause from the wrong quarter. While Gearon is properly coy with her daughter's genitals, her son's penis is displayed. Visually, the photo in which he urinates has a familial connection - however distant and accidental - with the pornographic variety known as golden showers. Similarly, the use of animal masks in some of the pictures might quicken the step of any gallery-visitor who happened to be into kids-and-pets porn. No artist gets to choose their audience. There's no doubt that, given the contemporary hysteria over child abuse, anyone who sent a roll of Gearon-like images along to Boots for processing would find a copper standing next to the sales assistant when they went in to collect them. Social services would at least want to talk to the children.</p> <p>So the question is whether artistic talent gives Gearon the licence to behave as no civilian parent could? Certainly, it seems improbable to me that any dedicated paedophile would head to the Saatchi Gallery in search of a kick from these images. They're ambiguous and tame beside the targeted nastiness to be found elsewhere.</p> <p>For observers of the tabloid arts, the motivation of the News of the World is fascinating. While suspected paedophilia in any place is the tabloid's trigger-issue at the moment, in this instance it's also clear that class anger plays a part. As the paper views it, the liberal middle-classes regard pictures of naked nippers as fine for those with university degrees who call it art, but paedophilia if you download them from cyberspace on a council estate. The News of the World sees the Saatchi Gallery as a descendant of the Chatterley case counsel, who wished to protect his servants from the novel, while implying that educated men would not be swayed by it.</p> <p>Gearon is most vulnerable on the matter of consent. There's always discomfort when the subjects of a picture don't fully understand the implications of display. This question arises, in a different way, with projects involving Alzheimer's patients. While, for Emilie and Michael, the shoots for Untitled were doubtless innocent fun with mum, you wonder about their reaction as teenagers and adults to the realisation that they have been displayed naked around the world. That isn't a police matter, but it's an important moral one.</p> <p>But history shows that the children of artists suffer one way or another. Novelists cannibalise their offspring for plots and dialogue. The children of photographers and film-makers endure the same process but with less possibility of disguise, unless mum or dad is into abstracts.</p> <p>Tierney Gearon's work promotes unease: some of it intended, some resulting from a failure to consider all the consequences. But the policing should be left to Brian Sewell, not the vice squad. For any tiny thrill bicycle-seat-sniffers might achieve at the gallery, they'd have to submit to rooms full of Charles Saatchi's rather erratic taste in modern art. You feel that the time of the filth cops would be better spent online or in Soho than in Hampstead.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:&quot;comment@theguardian.com&quot;\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Certainly, it seems improbable to me that any dedicated paedophile would head to the Saatchi Gallery in search of a kick from these images. They're ambiguous and tame beside the targeted nastiness to be found elsewhere. For observers of the tabloid arts, the motivation of the News of the World is fascinating. While suspected paedophilia in any place is the tabloid's trigger-issue at the moment, in this instance it's also clear that class anger plays a part. As the paper views it, the liberal middle-classes regard pictures of naked nippers as fine for those with university degrees who call it art, but paedophilia if you download them from cyberspace on a council estate. The News of the World sees the Saatchi Gallery as a descendant of the Chatterley case counsel, who wished to protect his servants from the novel, while implying that educated men would not be swayed by it. Gearon is most vulnerable on the matter of consent. There's always discomfort when the subjects of a picture don't fully understand the implications of display. This question arises, in a different way, with projects involving Alzheimer's patients. While, for Emilie and Michael, the shoots for Untitled were doubtless innocent fun with mum, you wonder about their reaction as teenagers and adults to the realisation that they have been displayed naked around the world. That isn't a police matter, but it's an important moral one. But history shows that the children of artists suffer one way or another. Novelists cannibalise their offspring for plots and dialogue. The children of photographers and film-makers endure the same process but with less possibility of disguise, unless mum or dad is into abstracts. Tierney Gearon's work promotes unease: some of it intended, some resulting from a failure to consider all the consequences. But the policing should be left to Brian Sewell, not the vice squad. For any tiny thrill bicycle-seat-sniffers might achieve at the gallery, they'd have to submit to rooms full of Charles Saatchi's rather erratic taste in modern art. You feel that the time of the filth cops would be better spent online or in Soho than in Hampstead. comment@theguardian.com",

One attack took place at her home, another in a room at the Bramshill police college in Hampshire, the court was told. He is also alleged to have committed perjury at the Lawrence inquiry on June 23, 1998, in making a statement \"which he knew to be false or did not believe to be true\", the court heard. The perjury charge relates to an eight page document Solley produced at the inquiry, which he described as an aide memoir and to have written himself. Solley - who met Stephen Lawrence's parents, Doreen and Neville, after the racist murder of their son - was praised in Sir William Macpherson's report on the police investigation of the killing. It said Solley, a community liaison officer for 10 years, was a \"sympathetic and well intentioned man\" whose \"value to the community was and is in our opinion considerable\". Solley was charged after answering bail at Belgravia police station yesterday. The officer has been suspended from duty since last October while inquiries into the allegations continued. He was granted bail on condition that he surrendered his passport and will appear at the Old Bailey later this month. He denies the charges.",

      "byline": "Peter Doyle",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The three most profitable businesses are supposedly narcotics, prostitution and ethical pharmaceuticals. A recent Oxfam report and the new novel by John le Carr\u00e9 have brought ethical pharma-companies into the spotlight. Both allege these companies exploit the poor in the developing world.</p> <p>With a median 35% return on equity, pharmaceuticals is far and away the world's most profitable major industry. With profits of more than $6bn, pharma-companies such as Pfizer and Glaxo SmithKline dwarf the likes of Unilever, BT or Coca-Cola. But to understand the sources of their wealth one must look to the West rather than the developing world.</p> <p>Europe, the US and Japan account for virtually all the profits of these companies. Their riches stem from the unique industry structure that governments have allowed them to create.</p> <p>In most markets profits are driven down by the power and price sensitivity of customers. But in pharmaceuticals, neither the patient who consumes the drugs, nor the doctor who prescribes them, is price sensitive. This is not because drugs are absolutely essential to life. If that were the case bread and milk companies would make huge profits. Customers for medicines are not price sensitive because they do not pay for them. In the UK it is the taxpayer who foots the bill.</p> <p>Whereas most companies have profits capped by aggressive industry buyers, the pharmas have to negotiate only with civil servants. As we have seen with the likes of the Dome, the Home Office computer debacle, or the \u00a3650 a day being paid to Railtrack labourers, when taxpayers money is available, commercial disciplines disappear.</p> <p>The second force that drives down prices in most industries is new competition. In electronics - an industry even more innovative than pharmaceuticals - excess profits from a new product soon disappear as competitors bring out copies. But in the pharmaceutical business, patents and government regulations block new competitors for an average of 10 years.</p> <p>The consequence of this ability to negotiate very high prices and the absence of competitive threat is that the giant pharmaceuticals have no incentive to compete on price. It also explains why the pharma-companies have been unwilling to sell cheap medicines to the poor in Africa and Asia. The real worry is that dropping prices to the developing world would undermine the enormous margins being received in the UK and US. Smart traders would soon be reimporting medicines at a fraction of the official price. Even the civil servants at the Department of Health might be stung into tougher negotiating.</p> <p>The industry's justification for its high prices and patent monopolies is that it encourages innovation. If margins were lower and patents were not enforced there would be no carrot to stimulate investment in R&amp;D. But innovation appears to depend on sticks as much as carrots. Intense competition in electronics is the stick that forces companies to innovate continually. Without new and better products companies such as Sony and Philips know they will not maintain growth and market share.</p> <p>Cost structures also appear to undermine the industry's case. Marketing expenses are typically almost double the R&amp;D spend. Glaxo, for example, has 10,000 scientists but 40,000 salespeople. Pharma-companies spend more on marketing current products than they do on developing new ones.</p> <p>\u2022 Peter Doyle is professor of marketing and strategy at the University of Warwick. His latest book is Value-based Marketing (Wiley).</p>",

      "bodyText": "The three most profitable businesses are supposedly narcotics, prostitution and ethical pharmaceuticals. A recent Oxfam report and the new novel by John le Carr\u00e9 have brought ethical pharma-companies into the spotlight. Both allege these companies exploit the poor in the developing world. With a median 35% return on equity, pharmaceuticals is far and away the world's most profitable major industry. With profits of more than $6bn, pharma-companies such as Pfizer and Glaxo SmithKline dwarf the likes of Unilever, BT or Coca-Cola. But to understand the sources of their wealth one must look to the West rather than the developing world. Europe, the US and Japan account for virtually all the profits of these companies. Their riches stem from the unique industry structure that governments have allowed them to create. In most markets profits are driven down by the power and price sensitivity of customers. But in pharmaceuticals, neither the patient who consumes the drugs, nor the doctor who prescribes them, is price sensitive. This is not because drugs are absolutely essential to life. If that were the case bread and milk companies would make huge profits. Customers for medicines are not price sensitive because they do not pay for them. In the UK it is the taxpayer who foots the bill. Whereas most companies have profits capped by aggressive industry buyers, the pharmas have to negotiate only with civil servants. As we have seen with the likes of the Dome, the Home Office computer debacle, or the \u00a3650 a day being paid to Railtrack labourers, when taxpayers money is available, commercial disciplines disappear. The second force that drives down prices in most industries is new competition. In electronics - an industry even more innovative than pharmaceuticals - excess profits from a new product soon disappear as competitors bring out copies. But in the pharmaceutical business, patents and government regulations block new competitors for an average of 10 years. The consequence of this ability to negotiate very high prices and the absence of competitive threat is that the giant pharmaceuticals have no incentive to compete on price. It also explains why the pharma-companies have been unwilling to sell cheap medicines to the poor in Africa and Asia. The real worry is that dropping prices to the developing world would undermine the enormous margins being received in the UK and US. Smart traders would soon be reimporting medicines at a fraction of the official price. Even the civil servants at the Department of Health might be stung into tougher negotiating. The industry's justification for its high prices and patent monopolies is that it encourages innovation. If margins were lower and patents were not enforced there would be no carrot to stimulate investment in R&amp;D. But innovation appears to depend on sticks as much as carrots. Intense competition in electronics is the stick that forces companies to innovate continually. Without new and better products companies such as Sony and Philips know they will not maintain growth and market share. Cost structures also appear to undermine the industry's case. Marketing expenses are typically almost double the R&amp;D spend. Glaxo, for example, has 10,000 scientists but 40,000 salespeople. Pharma-companies spend more on marketing current products than they do on developing new ones. \u2022 Peter Doyle is professor of marketing and strategy at the University of Warwick. His latest book is Value-based Marketing (Wiley).",

      "body": "<p>Amid evidence of spiralling stress levels and the unsettling presence of bullying in the workplace, another hidden trend that has yet to generate its own statistics is threatening to change the way businesses are run.</p> <p>Directors of small companies and multi-million pound enterprises find themselves drawn to the seemingly unfathomable benefits of new age or alternative remedies. For example, the ancient Chinese arts of feng shui - the placement of furniture and plants to harmonise energy flows - and I ching, a system of divination, are used to enhance profit margins and create healthier working environments.</p> <p>The motivation for this untraditional search has solid foundations. Last month a survey by Professor John McLeod from Dundee's Abertay University of 10,000 sufferers of workplace stress revealed they were displaying symptoms similar to those of psychiatric outpatients.</p> <p>Some 1,000 firms are already offering their employees free stress counselling services to counter the problem, but is this enough? No, argues Kenny D'Cruz, founding director of the Feng Shui Partnership. His clients, made up of estate agents, teachers, architects, computer specialists and management consultants, reveal a lack of fulfillment which, he says, is at the heart of the crisis. \"The traditional way of doing business was based on being good and uncritical. If you didn't conform, you could be out of a job. Business is about good relationships with staff, clients and suppliers with everyone giving positive energy.\"</p> <p>Sarah McCrum, managing director of the four-month-old Energy \"Bank\", run by Satellite 603, finds it hard to disagree with Mr D'Cruz's assessment. Located near Liverpool Street, London, surrounded by high finance, the Energy \"Bank\" says it simply provides energy through a range of services from massage to life design consultancy for managers and staff. \"It's a bit like a bank, but where energy is the currency rather than money,\" she explains.</p> <p>Although this definition would possibly cause the Bank of England to balk in disbelief, Satellite 603 isn't short of high-flying clients.</p> <p>From advertising agencies and investment bankers to dot.com companies and film producers, these clients are of ten stressed, exhausted, have recurrent illnesses and depleted energy levels.</p> <p>Clients make use of relaxation sessions in any one of the \"bank's\" five halls based on natural elements - fire, water, earth, wood and metal. Guided by the principles of feng shui and I ching, the company's main aim is for you relax 24 hours a day, wherever you are, be it at your desk or on a train. Professional business associations are treading very carefully on this new ground. A spokesman from the British Chambers of Commerce says cautiously: \"It would be inappropriate for me to suggest or advise that businesses take up or explore feng shui or some other new age option at the more unusual end of the spectrum.\" It suits 40-year-old Steve Saragossi. After 20 years in full-time employment, he decided eight months ago to launch The Comfort Factor Ltd, a direct marketing consultancy company.</p> <p>Mr Saragossi was introduced to feng shui when Mr D'Cruz and his business partner Kristian Pengkerego did a presentation for the Business Network International organisation. He was four months into his new role as managing director and the business wasn't looking too promising. \"I was stuck. There were lots of quotes for jobs, but hardly any commissions.\" On a whim he commissioned Mr D'Cruz and Mr Pengkerego who drew up western and Chinese astrological charts based on Mr Saragossi's date and time of birth.</p> <p>An extensive consultation was conducted, covering his life experiences, health and relationships, identifying recurring theme. Next was a visit to Mr Saragossi's office.</p> <p>\"My desk was facing a wall that was overburdened with shelves, and my back was to the door. They said this was making me feel claustrophobic, under pressure and I couldn't see who was coming in, which was right,\" Mr Saragossi admits.</p> <p>On advice, he bought a new desk and positioned it so that his back was to the wall, creating a feeling of security. Now he could see the door, which reduced feelings of paranoia and a lack of control.</p> <p>The shelves were removed and their contents were relocated to a box of drawers creating even more space. The dark green oppressive colour scheme was repainted in a light orange creating a sense of calmness.</p> <p>The positive results were immediate. \"Business calls increased and my phone hardly stopped ringing. Quotes I had made months before were coming back as commissions. It was a turning point and a lot more opportunities have presented themselves since.\" Before the feng shui consultancy, Mr Saragossi's biggest contract was \u00a312,500. Afterwards it was \u00a338,000. He feels more relaxed, less panicked and is now negotiating his biggest quote ever at \u00a3300,000.</p> <p>Jonathan Miller, the 30-year-old managing director of Alexanders, an estate agent in north-west London, has been using the Feng Shui Partnership for two-and-a-half years.</p> <p>When he first commissioned them his seven-year-old company was doing quite well, but was stagnating. All four workers including the accountant had a full consultation leading to a change in seating arrangements and decor. A crystal went on to Mr Miller's desk to suck up the negative ions. A mirror was placed outside the toilet door located at the bottom of the stairs that led straight into the office. \"This ensures that the energy bounces back up the stairs back into the office rather than going, quite literally, down the toilet.\"</p> <p>A few weeks before the feng shui session Mr Miller had placed his quarterly VAT return and the company's turnover stood at \u00a350,000. By the next quarter it had doubled to \u00a3100,000, and it hasn't stopped rising since.</p> <p>After further consultations, Miller is about to take on more staff, is opening another office next month and has just refurbished his existing branch. His agents' commissions have regularly increased and clients appear more satisfied, leading to a rise in repeat business. Back at the Energy \"Bank\" Dominic Richards, 34, is planning a business energy package for key members of his 17-strong staff.</p> <p>As joint chief executive of <a href=\"http://queercompany.com\" target=\"_new\">Queercompany.com</a>, Mr Richards has been using the \"bank\" since December, a month after the official launch for the gay and lesbian lifestyle portal.</p> <p>Virtually every newspaper covered Queercompany's bold advertising campaign, particularly the one featuring two women kissing in bed with the title \"Thank God for Women\". Despite this promising start Mr Richards felt that as a senior manager fronting a \u00a33.5m venture, he had to be effective and calm. He was acutely aware that he had to make \u00a32m by the end of this year. \"As the joint chief executive of the company, any change or progress has to start with me. If I'm not calm, sorted, together and clear either I'm not going to make the right decisions.\" Since January he has been attending relaxation and life training sessions with an instructor every morning.</p> <p>Like Mr Miller and Mr Saragossi, Mr Richards had his western and Chinese birth charts produced along with a consultation about his goals and the blocks to his achieving them.</p> <p>He realised he was panicked, felt he had to control everything and was stressed. Now, he is calmer and is working more harmoniously with his management team in a way that wasn't apparent before. \"People find me more approachable now. We are finding new avenues of income and new partnerships. It has been brilliant,\" he says. From his more relaxed position Mr Richards noticed that stress-related illnesses were already an issue among his staff who had been working hard since April in preparation for the launch. It doesn't help that there are 30 computers in one room and papers everywhere. Which is why he is negotiating a relaxation package for his staff with the Energy \"Bank\". Attending it made Mr Richards realise that \"I have to look after the well being of my people and my company\".</p> <p>He plans to refurbish the offices including the creation of three large communal workstations surrounded by calm colours along with a juice bar \"so there'll be high energy and soft energy spaces\".</p> <p>Not all of the commercial clients who are seeing positive results from using these techniques are willing to go on the record. Many fear ridicule or unfavourable feedback from their profit conscious shareholders.</p> <p>Richard Wilson, Business Policy Executive at the Institute of Directors, isn't surprised at the reticence, but concedes the information they hold could be \"useful if shared more openly\".</p> <p>That openness may take some time coming. But as some companies are offering their hard working staff free membership to gyms and dating agencies there is definitely a move away from traditional methods of retaining staff.</p> <p>Sceptics may want to take Jonathan Miller up on his offer. \"Get feng shui done.

Directors of small companies and multi-million pound enterprises find themselves drawn to the seemingly unfathomable benefits of new age or alternative remedies. For example, the ancient Chinese arts of feng shui - the placement of furniture and plants to harmonise energy flows - and I ching, a system of divination, are used to enhance profit margins and create healthier working environments. The motivation for this untraditional search has solid foundations. Last month a survey by Professor John McLeod from Dundee's Abertay University of 10,000 sufferers of workplace stress revealed they were displaying symptoms similar to those of psychiatric outpatients. Some 1,000 firms are already offering their employees free stress counselling services to counter the problem, but is this enough? No, argues Kenny D'Cruz, founding director of the Feng Shui Partnership. His clients, made up of estate agents, teachers, architects, computer specialists and management consultants, reveal a lack of fulfillment which, he says, is at the heart of the crisis. \"The traditional way of doing business was based on being good and uncritical. If you didn't conform, you could be out of a job. Business is about good relationships with staff, clients and suppliers with everyone giving positive energy.\" Sarah McCrum, managing director of the four-month-old Energy \"Bank\", run by Satellite 603, finds it hard to disagree with Mr D'Cruz's assessment. Located near Liverpool Street, London, surrounded by high finance, the Energy \"Bank\" says it simply provides energy through a range of services from massage to life design consultancy for managers and staff. \"It's a bit like a bank, but where energy is the currency rather than money,\" she explains. Although this definition would possibly cause the Bank of England to balk in disbelief, Satellite 603 isn't short of high-flying clients. From advertising agencies and investment bankers to dot.com companies and film producers, these clients are of ten stressed, exhausted, have recurrent illnesses and depleted energy levels. Clients make use of relaxation sessions in any one of the \"bank's\" five halls based on natural elements - fire, water, earth, wood and metal. Guided by the principles of feng shui and I ching, the company's main aim is for you relax 24 hours a day, wherever you are, be it at your desk or on a train. Professional business associations are treading very carefully on this new ground. A spokesman from the British Chambers of Commerce says cautiously: \"It would be inappropriate for me to suggest or advise that businesses take up or explore feng shui or some other new age option at the more unusual end of the spectrum.\" It suits 40-year-old Steve Saragossi. After 20 years in full-time employment, he decided eight months ago to launch The Comfort Factor Ltd, a direct marketing consultancy company. Mr Saragossi was introduced to feng shui when Mr D'Cruz and his business partner Kristian Pengkerego did a presentation for the Business Network International organisation. He was four months into his new role as managing director and the business wasn't looking too promising. \"I was stuck. There were lots of quotes for jobs, but hardly any commissions.\" On a whim he commissioned Mr D'Cruz and Mr Pengkerego who drew up western and Chinese astrological charts based on Mr Saragossi's date and time of birth. An extensive consultation was conducted, covering his life experiences, health and relationships, identifying recurring theme. Next was a visit to Mr Saragossi's office. \"My desk was facing a wall that was overburdened with shelves, and my back was to the door. They said this was making me feel claustrophobic, under pressure and I couldn't see who was coming in, which was right,\" Mr Saragossi admits. On advice, he bought a new desk and positioned it so that his back was to the wall, creating a feeling of security. Now he could see the door, which reduced feelings of paranoia and a lack of control. The shelves were removed and their contents were relocated to a box of drawers creating even more space. The dark green oppressive colour scheme was repainted in a light orange creating a sense of calmness. The positive results were immediate. \"Business calls increased and my phone hardly stopped ringing. Quotes I had made months before were coming back as commissions. It was a turning point and a lot more opportunities have presented themselves since.\" Before the feng shui consultancy, Mr Saragossi's biggest contract was \u00a312,500. Afterwards it was \u00a338,000. He feels more relaxed, less panicked and is now negotiating his biggest quote ever at \u00a3300,000. Jonathan Miller, the 30-year-old managing director of Alexanders, an estate agent in north-west London, has been using the Feng Shui Partnership for two-and-a-half years. When he first commissioned them his seven-year-old company was doing quite well, but was stagnating. All four workers including the accountant had a full consultation leading to a change in seating arrangements and decor. A crystal went on to Mr Miller's desk to suck up the negative ions. A mirror was placed outside the toilet door located at the bottom of the stairs that led straight into the office. \"This ensures that the energy bounces back up the stairs back into the office rather than going, quite literally, down the toilet.\" A few weeks before the feng shui session Mr Miller had placed his quarterly VAT return and the company's turnover stood at \u00a350,000. By the next quarter it had doubled to \u00a3100,000, and it hasn't stopped rising since. After further consultations, Miller is about to take on more staff, is opening another office next month and has just refurbished his existing branch. His agents' commissions have regularly increased and clients appear more satisfied, leading to a rise in repeat business. Back at the Energy \"Bank\" Dominic Richards, 34, is planning a business energy package for key members of his 17-strong staff. As joint chief executive of Queercompany.com, Mr Richards has been using the \"bank\" since December, a month after the official launch for the gay and lesbian lifestyle portal. Virtually every newspaper covered Queercompany's bold advertising campaign, particularly the one featuring two women kissing in bed with the title \"Thank God for Women\". Despite this promising start Mr Richards felt that as a senior manager fronting a \u00a33.5m venture, he had to be effective and calm. He was acutely aware that he had to make \u00a32m by the end of this year. \"As the joint chief executive of the company, any change or progress has to start with me. If I'm not calm, sorted, together and clear either I'm not going to make the right decisions.\" Since January he has been attending relaxation and life training sessions with an instructor every morning. Like Mr Miller and Mr Saragossi, Mr Richards had his western and Chinese birth charts produced along with a consultation about his goals and the blocks to his achieving them. He realised he was panicked, felt he had to control everything and was stressed. Now, he is calmer and is working more harmoniously with his management team in a way that wasn't apparent before. \"People find me more approachable now. We are finding new avenues of income and new partnerships. It has been brilliant,\" he says. From his more relaxed position Mr Richards noticed that stress-related illnesses were already an issue among his staff who had been working hard since April in preparation for the launch. It doesn't help that there are 30 computers in one room and papers everywhere. Which is why he is negotiating a relaxation package for his staff with the Energy \"Bank\". Attending it made Mr Richards realise that \"I have to look after the well being of my people and my company\". He plans to refurbish the offices including the creation of three large communal workstations surrounded by calm colours along with a juice bar \"so there'll be high energy and soft energy spaces\". Not all of the commercial clients who are seeing positive results from using these techniques are willing to go on the record. Many fear ridicule or unfavourable feedback from their profit conscious shareholders. Richard Wilson, Business Policy Executive at the Institute of Directors, isn't surprised at the reticence, but concedes the information they hold could be \"useful if shared more openly\". That openness may take some time coming. But as some companies are offering their hard working staff free membership to gyms and dating agencies there is definitely a move away from traditional methods of retaining staff. Sceptics may want to take Jonathan Miller up on his offer. \"Get feng shui done. If it doesn't work I'll pay for it.\" \u0095 The Feng Shui Partnership.

Browsing around their shop, I hardly ever leave without buying at least one book. On a cold day before Christmas I was surprised to be served with a glass of sherry and mince pies. Less than five minutes walk away, a two-storey Waterstones opened some time ago. Inge Trott Cheam, Surrey \u0095 Our reading group (Letters, March 7) began in 1966 and are still going strong. We began as young mums in our early thirties in need of intellectual stimulation. Many of us are now retired and still enjoy the excitement that reading and discussion brings. As society changed its attitude to women with children working, we resumed our careers and in many cases developed new ones. Those changes in society are reflected in our choice of books: the first one in 1966 was Robin Pedley's The Comprehensive School; in 1976 we read Melanie Klein's Working With Groups; in 1980, Marilyn French's The Women's Room; in 1990 Have The Men Had Enough? by Margaret Forster. Our next book is Jeremy Leggett's The Carbon War. What keeps us going? The love of a good book, of course. Vera Ransome and the other 16 in the group Lewes, East Sussex",

I am tempted to take out one of the new-style mortgages which combine home loans with current accounts. Would they be suitable or are there hidden drawbacks? </b> <b>LE, Leicester</b> <p>It seems that your main desire is to pay off your loan as quickly as possible. That makes sense as it is better to repay a loan than to keep a large amount of savings on which you pay tax. You should, of course, have an emergency fund as well. </p> <p>As you are not held in by redemption penalties, you have three main choices. You could stay with your present lender and arrange to increase your payments. But you are likely to be on a high standard variable rate. </p> <p> A second choice is to take out a combined loan and current account package. But the choice is not large. Britannic (formerly First Active), Clydesdale, Intelligent Finance, Virgin, Woolwich and Yorkshire Bank are the main players. These accounts do offset interest on your loan against your whole bank balance, but you may have to pay in your salary and re-arrange overdraft facilities. </p> <p>Possibly your best option is to go for a flexible mortgage with a lump sum withdrawal facility for emergencies. This would cope with your extra \u00a3500 a month but return some of your additional payments in case of need. There is a wide variety of these. </p> <p><b> My \u00a359,000 mortgage has 17 years to run - I'm currently paying 6.84% fixed until April 2004. If I want to redeem it, there is a penalty clause during the next three years which will cost 4% of the sum borrowed. But I have recently come into a \u00a360,000 inheritance. Should I clear the mortgage even though I have to pay the penalty or should I invest the money?</b> </p> <p><b> AF, Bradford</b> </p> <p> Bite the bullet and pay the penalty. Unless you are willing to take substantial risks with your cash which come right, paying off your loan makes sense. Here's the arithmetic. You are paying \u00a34,035 a year in interest or \u00a312,105 over the remaining three years. But how much would you earn from your savings - assuming your are a basic rate taxpayer? You would be lucky to keep up 6% gross on your lump sum over the period unless you are prepared to take risks. This would amount to around \u00a38,640 - \u00a36,480 if you are a higher rate taxpayer. Add those figures to the penalty, which works out at \u00a32,360 (from your windfall) and you are better off clearing the loan. </p> <p><b> We recently remortgaged from First Direct to Hinckley &amp; Rugby Building Society, saving more than \u00a360 a month on a \u00a392,000 mortgage and freeing up \u00a36,000 for home improvements into the bargain. But our experience has thrown up issues. These include: </b></p> <p>\u0095 <b>A daunting range of deals, each of which claims to be the best </b> <br> \u0095<b>Complicated cash-back deals which seem to be paid for by higher interest rates</b> <br> \u0095<b>Huge amounts of form-filling and the need to produce original documents </b><br>\u0095<b> Legal fees running up to \u00a3350 in our case. </b> </p> <p> <b>PW and SH, London</b> </p> <p> There is nothing for nothing in finance. Working your way through the minefield of confusion marketing - where no two products are comparable - is not easy, but can become simpler if you decide your priorities from a remortgage. You may want to swap legal costs for a higher rate or go for lower interest by giving up initial attractions such as cash-backs. Before you switch your loan again, phone 0800-694-6444 for a free copy of the Guardian Guide to Remortgaging. </p> <p> <b> Problems holding overseas shares </b></p> <p> I hold a few shares in South African diamond producer De Beers, which has received a takeover bid from mining group Anglo American. The only form of payment, I have heard, is cash. But that would give me a complicated capital gains tax calculation. Is there any way of avoiding or delaying a capital gain either by receiving shares in Anglo American or another firm? </p> <p><b> ME, London</b> </p> <p> This is a complicated situation in that Anglo and De Beers already own about a third of the shares in each other. And it does not help that few private client stockbrokers follow either of these South African companies even though Anglo is, for convenience, listed in London. </p> <p> These companies are really two facets of the same Oppenheimer finance and mines empire. Your problem is not as great as you fear as the deal, whose chances of failure are about the same as of you finding gem quality diamonds at the bottom of your garden, swaps each De Beer share for $14.40 in cash (about \u00a310) and 0.43 Anglo shares (worth about \u00a320). </p> <p> So, any capital gains tax would only be levied on the cash element which may well be within your annual limit. But if your holding is large, you could shelter some of the gain if you reinvest in a Venture Capital Trust. </p> <p>This takeover has not been arranged to benefit small shareholders or even institutional UK shareholders. That is always a risk when dealing in overseas shares. </p> <p> <b> Why was I refused a credit card? </b></p> <p><b> I recently applied for a Nationwide credit card and was turned down. I found this surprising as I am in comfortable circumstances, have been with the same employer for 25 years and in the same house for 20 years. I have never had any problems with debt or credit and usually clear my cards each month. The Experian report confirms my exemplary financial history. I no longer want the credit card as I got a better deal with Egg, but would like to know why Nationwide rejected me. </b></p> <p> <b>MP, London</b> </p> <p> And that is all you are likely to get. Credit card companies are not obliged to tell you why they turned you down. It seems, however, that someone made a mistake and has covered it up. But the current Egg deal is better than anything Nationwide can offer. </p> <p> <b> A savings plan for my baby </b></p> <p><b> I had my first baby in September 2000. I am receiving \u00a360 per month Child Benefit and would like to establish a regular savings plan to make some tax-efficient use of these extra funds for long-term investment. perhaps for school fees later. What should I do? Take out a friendly society bond? </b></p> <p> <b>JW, London</b> </p> <p> Friendly society bonds suffer from high charges and low investment limits - currently \u00a325 a month. As you are investing your money for your child, you should look for an investment trust with a low-cost savings scheme which has a worldwide general remit - the biggest include Foreign &amp; Colonial, Witan and Scottish American. You can get a list from the Association of Investment Trust Companies on 0800-085-8520. </p> <p><b>\u00a38,000 payments comedy of errors</b></p> <p> <b>Last November, I decided to switch my credit card balance from MBNA to Halifax. I liked the Halifax introductory rate and the better facilities. In December, my Halifax card arrived and I asked Halifax to pay \u00a38,000 to MBNA to close my debt with it. I then chopped up the MBNA card. </b></p> <p><b>But that's when my problems started. Firstly, Halifax told me the sum was too big even though it was within my credit limit. At the same time, however, someone else did switch the \u00a38,000 to MBNA. </b></p> <p><b>When they finally responded to my request for information on my credit limit, they sent a further \u00a38,000 to MBNA. But I did not know this as I went to South Africa at Christmas. On my return, I discovered the Halifax was charging interest on \u00a316,000. </b></p> <p><b>Several phone calls got me nowhere - and letters seem to be ignored. Eventually, I got through to someone who promised to sort it out. </b></p> <p><b>The end result was that both of the \u00a38,000 sums were taken back from MBNA, leaving me with even bigger interest bills and fees for late payments from MBNA.</b> </p> <p><b> What is going on? This is costing me a fortune in phone calls, letters, interest and nervous energy. </b></p> <p><b> PK, London </b> </p> <p>The to-ing and fro-ing of your \u00a38,000 payments would seem to be a comedy of errors. Halifax has looked into your problem and admits that you have not been well served. It blames bad luck, internal errors and your own intervention for the difficulties. </p> <p>Halifax claims that one letter sent to a senior person was never received. To make matters worse, you were never too clear whose fault the cash tennis rally was. </p> <p> But at least Halifax admits that it has not performed to an acceptable standard.It has arranged to refund all the interest charges during this period, and to send you \u00a320 for your time and expenses. That ex-gratia payment should be at least \u00a3100. </p> <p>\u0095 Got a problem? We want to hear about it.

Possibly your best option is to go for a flexible mortgage with a lump sum withdrawal facility for emergencies. This would cope with your extra \u00a3500 a month but return some of your additional payments in case of need. There is a wide variety of these. My \u00a359,000 mortgage has 17 years to run - I'm currently paying 6.84% fixed until April 2004. If I want to redeem it, there is a penalty clause during the next three years which will cost 4% of the sum borrowed. But I have recently come into a \u00a360,000 inheritance. Should I clear the mortgage even though I have to pay the penalty or should I invest the money? AF, Bradford Bite the bullet and pay the penalty. Unless you are willing to take substantial risks with your cash which come right, paying off your loan makes sense. Here's the arithmetic. You are paying \u00a34,035 a year in interest or \u00a312,105 over the remaining three years. But how much would you earn from your savings - assuming your are a basic rate taxpayer? You would be lucky to keep up 6% gross on your lump sum over the period unless you are prepared to take risks. This would amount to around \u00a38,640 - \u00a36,480 if you are a higher rate taxpayer. Add those figures to the penalty, which works out at \u00a32,360 (from your windfall) and you are better off clearing the loan. We recently remortgaged from First Direct to Hinckley &amp; Rugby Building Society, saving more than \u00a360 a month on a \u00a392,000 mortgage and freeing up \u00a36,000 for home improvements into the bargain. But our experience has thrown up issues. These include: \u0095 A daunting range of deals, each of which claims to be the best \u0095Complicated cash-back deals which seem to be paid for by higher interest rates \u0095Huge amounts of form-filling and the need to produce original documents \u0095 Legal fees running up to \u00a3350 in our case. PW and SH, London There is nothing for nothing in finance. Working your way through the minefield of confusion marketing - where no two products are comparable - is not easy, but can become simpler if you decide your priorities from a remortgage. You may want to swap legal costs for a higher rate or go for lower interest by giving up initial attractions such as cash-backs.

Problems holding overseas shares I hold a few shares in South African diamond producer De Beers, which has received a takeover bid from mining group Anglo American. The only form of payment, I have heard, is cash. But that would give me a complicated capital gains tax calculation. Is there any way of avoiding or delaying a capital gain either by receiving shares in Anglo American or another firm? ME, London This is a complicated situation in that Anglo and De Beers already own about a third of the shares in each other. And it does not help that few private client stockbrokers follow either of these South African companies even though Anglo is, for convenience, listed in London. These companies are really two facets of the same Oppenheimer finance and mines empire. Your problem is not as great as you fear as the deal, whose chances of failure are about the same as of you finding gem quality diamonds at the bottom of your garden, swaps each De Beer share for $14.40 in cash (about \u00a310) and 0.43 Anglo shares (worth about \u00a320). So, any capital gains tax would only be levied on the cash element which may well be within your annual limit. But if your holding is large, you could shelter some of the gain if you reinvest in a Venture Capital Trust. This takeover has not been arranged to benefit small shareholders or even institutional UK shareholders. That is always a risk when dealing in overseas shares. Why was I refused a credit card? I recently applied for a Nationwide credit card and was turned down. I found this surprising as I am in comfortable circumstances, have been with the same employer for 25 years and in the same house for 20 years. I have never had any problems with debt or credit and usually clear my cards each month. The Experian report confirms my exemplary financial history. I no longer want the credit card as I got a better deal with Egg, but would like to know why Nationwide rejected me. MP, London And that is all you are likely to get. Credit card companies are not obliged to tell you why they turned you down. It seems, however, that someone made a mistake and has covered it up. But the current Egg deal is better than anything Nationwide can offer. A savings plan for my baby I had my first baby in September 2000. I am receiving \u00a360 per month Child Benefit and would like to establish a regular savings plan to make some tax-efficient use of these extra funds for long-term investment. perhaps for school fees later. What should I do? Take out a friendly society bond? JW, London Friendly society bonds suffer from high charges and low investment limits - currently \u00a325 a month. As you are investing your money for your child, you should look for an investment trust with a low-cost savings scheme which has a worldwide general remit - the biggest include Foreign &amp; Colonial, Witan and Scottish American. You can get a list from the Association of Investment Trust Companies on 0800-085-8520. \u00a38,000 payments comedy of errors Last November, I decided to switch my credit card balance from MBNA to Halifax. I liked the Halifax introductory rate and the better facilities. In December, my Halifax card arrived and I asked Halifax to pay \u00a38,000 to MBNA to close my debt with it. I then chopped up the MBNA card. But that's when my problems started. Firstly, Halifax told me the sum was too big even though it was within my credit limit. At the same time, however, someone else did switch the \u00a38,000 to MBNA. When they finally responded to my request for information on my credit limit, they sent a further \u00a38,000 to MBNA. But I did not know this as I went to South Africa at Christmas. On my return, I discovered the Halifax was charging interest on \u00a316,000. Several phone calls got me nowhere - and letters seem to be ignored. Eventually, I got through to someone who promised to sort it out. The end result was that both of the \u00a38,000 sums were taken back from MBNA, leaving me with even bigger interest bills and fees for late payments from MBNA. What is going on? This is costing me a fortune in phone calls, letters, interest and nervous energy. PK, London The to-ing and fro-ing of your \u00a38,000 payments would seem to be a comedy of errors. Halifax has looked into your problem and admits that you have not been well served. It blames bad luck, internal errors and your own intervention for the difficulties. Halifax claims that one letter sent to a senior person was never received. To make matters worse, you were never too clear whose fault the cash tennis rally was. But at least Halifax admits that it has not performed to an acceptable standard.It has arranged to refund all the interest charges during this period, and to send you \u00a320 for your time and expenses. That ex-gratia payment should be at least \u00a3100. \u0095 Got a problem? We want to hear about it.

Perhaps he should, like the rest of us who are getting old and forgetful, retire to spend more time with his dogs. Eileen Noakes Totnes, Devon eileen.noakes@talk21.com \u0095 We all know that Tony Blair, and indeed Jack Straw, need to be seen as being tough on offenders. However, if this is what Peter Mandelson gets for being innocent, it is difficult to imagine what they would have done to him for being guilty. Rev John Gillibrand Menai Bridge, Anglesey Gillibrands@aol.com \u0095 I have been a member of the Labour party for 37 years and I first wrote to Tony Blair in 1999 expressing concern at the way my party was developing and gave the arrogance of Peter Mandelson as just one example. This was not, and never has been, acknowledged - although minor party minions were at pains to persuade me to stay in membership, since I had said that I was having to consider this very seriously. Obviously where I went wrong was in not signing the letter \"MJ Hinduja\" and including an invitation to a Diwali party. Mick Williams Stoke-on-Trent MICK.WILLIAMS@GEO2.POPTEL.ORG.UK",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The foot and mouth outbreak will continue much longer than originally thought because sheep with links to infected sites may have been bought outside the official sales rings and are now untraceable and suffering from the disease.</p> <p>Jim Scudamore, the government's chief vet, said farmers may have bought sheep without realising they were infected - the disease is difficult to spot in sheep - and without paperwork, making it hard to trace them. He urged farmers to come forward to allow their animals to be inspected by vets.</p> <p>New outbreaks are being discovered because newborn lambs are dying of the disease, one of the most obvious signs that a flock is infected. Cattle are also developing the disease, having caught it from contact with sheep without the farmer realising his sheep have been infected.</p> <p>Anyone who has traded sheep in or around any of the half a dozen markets known to have links to the disease is being asked to come forward. Some of these people may have committed criminal offences by not completing the necessary paperwork but their help is vital if the disease is to be contained, he said.</p> <p>The disease already covers a much larger area of the country than in the 1967 epidemic, reflecting a huge change in farming methods. Although there were 2,364 farms involved in 1967, they were mostly confined to Welsh border areas and in six months never reached as far south as Devon or as far north as Cumbria.</p> <p>Although the number of farms involved is fewer at this stage of the outbreak than in 1967, the number of animals to be killed - 100,000 - is much greater, reflecting the increased size of both holdings and flocks.</p> <p>In the latest outbreak the disease was spread round the country in just days as dealers shipped sheep from market to market to make extra profits. Because of local abattoirs being replaced with larger specialist operations infected livestock have been transported much longer distances.</p> <p>The infection had moved from Heddon-on-the-Wall in Northumberland to Essex as part of the pig trade, to Cumbria, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Devon, and as far east as Northampton as fat lambs were traded.</p> <p>Mr Scudamore was more pessimistic yesterday than at any time since the start of the foot and mouth outbreak saying that he did not know when the number of cases would start to go down. He said: \"The fact is we do not know where all the flocks incubating this disease are, or how many more there might be.\"</p> <p>He said he was still sure the best way to stop a further spread was to continue movement restrictions on all farm animals. All the cases so far can be traced back to the original outbreak at Heddon-on-the-Wall. \"If we suddenly get new cases in new parts of the country without links to these cases then we are in a much more serious situation,\" he said.</p> <p>The continued increase in the number of cases means that the restrictions on the movement of animals would have to be extended beyond next Friday when they officially end, he said.</p> <p>A new problem is the possibility that a small number of sheep become carriers. These are animals that have the disease and get better without the farmer noticing. These sheep are not normally infectious but if they are put in a stressful situation, for example loaded in a lorry and carried long distances, then they could pass on the disease. Sheep can be carriers for up to nine weeks after recovering from the infection.</p> <p>To guard against new outbreaks among sheep that had not been detected with the disease, a regime of movement restrictions would have to be imposed.</p> <p>Yesterday, Lady Hayman, the junior agriculture minister, agreed with farmers' leaders a limited movement of animals for welfare reasons. Cattle, pigs and sheep can now be moved across roads on farms for milking or to give birth. Where animals are on hills and need to be brought to shelter for lambing they can be moved up to three miles but both kinds of movement require a special licence.</p> <p>The wider scheme for the collecting of animals from small farms to holding centres and then moving them on for slaughter has been postponed because of the dangers of spreading the disease and possible objections from the European Union, which had banned such movements on the continent.</p> <p>Licences for moving animals from large holdings direct to slaughterhouses continue to be issued. Pig meat has reached 81% of normal supplies, beef 53% and lamb 25%. There are no shortages in the shops because the shortfall is being made up from foreign supplies.</p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,443686,00.html\">Full list: outbreaks and precautionary measures</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a></p> <p><b>The front line</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br>What is the situation on the ground?

Jim Scudamore, the government's chief vet, said farmers may have bought sheep without realising they were infected - the disease is difficult to spot in sheep - and without paperwork, making it hard to trace them. He urged farmers to come forward to allow their animals to be inspected by vets. New outbreaks are being discovered because newborn lambs are dying of the disease, one of the most obvious signs that a flock is infected. Cattle are also developing the disease, having caught it from contact with sheep without the farmer realising his sheep have been infected. Anyone who has traded sheep in or around any of the half a dozen markets known to have links to the disease is being asked to come forward. Some of these people may have committed criminal offences by not completing the necessary paperwork but their help is vital if the disease is to be contained, he said. The disease already covers a much larger area of the country than in the 1967 epidemic, reflecting a huge change in farming methods. Although there were 2,364 farms involved in 1967, they were mostly confined to Welsh border areas and in six months never reached as far south as Devon or as far north as Cumbria. Although the number of farms involved is fewer at this stage of the outbreak than in 1967, the number of animals to be killed - 100,000 - is much greater, reflecting the increased size of both holdings and flocks. In the latest outbreak the disease was spread round the country in just days as dealers shipped sheep from market to market to make extra profits. Because of local abattoirs being replaced with larger specialist operations infected livestock have been transported much longer distances. The infection had moved from Heddon-on-the-Wall in Northumberland to Essex as part of the pig trade, to Cumbria, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Devon, and as far east as Northampton as fat lambs were traded. Mr Scudamore was more pessimistic yesterday than at any time since the start of the foot and mouth outbreak saying that he did not know when the number of cases would start to go down. He said: \"The fact is we do not know where all the flocks incubating this disease are, or how many more there might be.\" He said he was still sure the best way to stop a further spread was to continue movement restrictions on all farm animals. All the cases so far can be traced back to the original outbreak at Heddon-on-the-Wall. \"If we suddenly get new cases in new parts of the country without links to these cases then we are in a much more serious situation,\" he said. The continued increase in the number of cases means that the restrictions on the movement of animals would have to be extended beyond next Friday when they officially end, he said. A new problem is the possibility that a small number of sheep become carriers. These are animals that have the disease and get better without the farmer noticing. These sheep are not normally infectious but if they are put in a stressful situation, for example loaded in a lorry and carried long distances, then they could pass on the disease. Sheep can be carriers for up to nine weeks after recovering from the infection. To guard against new outbreaks among sheep that had not been detected with the disease, a regime of movement restrictions would have to be imposed. Yesterday, Lady Hayman, the junior agriculture minister, agreed with farmers' leaders a limited movement of animals for welfare reasons. Cattle, pigs and sheep can now be moved across roads on farms for milking or to give birth. Where animals are on hills and need to be brought to shelter for lambing they can be moved up to three miles but both kinds of movement require a special licence. The wider scheme for the collecting of animals from small farms to holding centres and then moving them on for slaughter has been postponed because of the dangers of spreading the disease and possible objections from the European Union, which had banned such movements on the continent. Licences for moving animals from large holdings direct to slaughterhouses continue to be issued. Pig meat has reached 81% of normal supplies, beef 53% and lamb 25%. There are no shortages in the shops because the shortfall is being made up from foreign supplies. What's going on?

Gigante, who acquired the soubriquet of The Oddfather, would wander Greenwich Village in a bathrobe, apparently intent on appearing too mad to be really bad.</p> <p>Mr Spero, on the other hand, has no nickname. Grey-haired and not much more than 5ft (1.5m) tall, he confounds the mob mythology fashioned by popular culture. There is nothing about him of Tony Soprano's wise-guy brashness, none of the corrupt grandeur of the characters in Francis Ford Coppola's film The Godfather.</p> <p>His bearing is closer to the anachronistic breed of mafia employed in director Jim Jarmusch's cult movie Ghost Dog. Indeed, the main character, a hitman played by Forest Whitaker, tends pigeons on a rooftop.</p> <p>Mr Spero prefers cardigans and sausage sandwiches to designer suits and dinners in New York's finest steakhouses.</p> <p>His chosen medium of communication with his mob underlings is said to have been meetings with fellow bird enthusiasts on top of the Big Apple car service, owned by his daughter Diana, in Brooklyn. They would then pass on his orders.</p> <p>Asked what Mr Spero's favourite topics of conversation were, one witness told a bail hearing: \"Baseball, football, women.

      "bodyText": "Anthony Spero finally had a day out yesterday, but the 72-year-old pigeon-fancier would have preferred not to have spent it in a Brooklyn courtroom being tried for ordering three Mafia killings. Mr Spero - said to be the number three, or consigliere, in one of New York's five crime families - has been under house arrest for almost two years, and is allowed out now only to go to federal court. The benign-looking old man, who is alleged to have been everything from a soldier to the acting boss of the Bonanno crime family, is one of a dying breed. A detective called the trial \"one of the last of its kind,\" recalling the days when tales of turncoats, loansharking, gambling, rackets and revenge served cold were the common currency of the city's legal system. Since then the families' influence has since waned, their leaders have dispersed, their membership has fallen, under the impact of a series of set backs, the biggest of which were the jailing of John \"Dapper Don\" Gotti, boss of the Gambino family, in 1992 and Vincent \"The Chin\" Gigante, five years later. Gotti, also known as the Teflon Don and the most prominent gangster in the US since Al Capone, courted celebrity. Gigante, who acquired the soubriquet of The Oddfather, would wander Greenwich Village in a bathrobe, apparently intent on appearing too mad to be really bad. Mr Spero, on the other hand, has no nickname. Grey-haired and not much more than 5ft (1.5m) tall, he confounds the mob mythology fashioned by popular culture. There is nothing about him of Tony Soprano's wise-guy brashness, none of the corrupt grandeur of the characters in Francis Ford Coppola's film The Godfather. His bearing is closer to the anachronistic breed of mafia employed in director Jim Jarmusch's cult movie Ghost Dog. Indeed, the main character, a hitman played by Forest Whitaker, tends pigeons on a rooftop. Mr Spero prefers cardigans and sausage sandwiches to designer suits and dinners in New York's finest steakhouses. His chosen medium of communication with his mob underlings is said to have been meetings with fellow bird enthusiasts on top of the Big Apple car service, owned by his daughter Diana, in Brooklyn. They would then pass on his orders. Asked what Mr Spero's favourite topics of conversation were, one witness told a bail hearing: \"Baseball, football, women. Organised crime, mafia - anything like that has never come from his lips.\" He is accused of ordering the killing of a drug dealer who threatened him in 1993 and, two years earlier, that of a small-time thief who made the mistake of breaking into his daughter's home and stealing a necklace with her name picked out in diamonds. Alphonse \"Little Al\" D'Arco, a former crime boss who is testifying for the 10th time in a mob trial, told the court of his last meeting with Mr Spero. \"He went off in the speech that all rats, their families, women and children, should be murdered. I was shocked. In this life you don't interfere with personal family.\" The Bonannos were the first crime family to be penetrated by the undercover FBI agent Joseph Pistone, who provided the kernel of the story for the film Donnie Brasco, starring Al Pacino. \"After that, they closed ranks,\" Jerry Capeci, author of several books on the mafia, said. \"They've tried to operate like a secret society.\" Joseph Massino is credited with that closing of the ranks, after he allegedly took control eight years ago. \"Joe Massino learned from the mistakes of other bosses who unwisely attracted attention to themselves,\" Lewis Schiliro, former assistant director of the FBI's New York office, said. \"He is the undisputed leader of the family, a low-key guy who avoids the spotlight, who has brought back discipline and order.\" Mr Massino, 58, is a co-owner of the Casablanca restaurant in Queens, frequented by such stars as Hugh Grant, Liz Hurley and Johnny Depp, whose photographs are on the wall. When Mr Pistone walked past Mr Massino to testify during his trial on racketeering and extortion charges in 1986, the restaurateur is said to have asked him: \"Hey Donnie, who did you get to play me in the movie?\" Now Mr Massino says: \"I did my time, I paid my dues. They can claim what they want, but it's not true. I don't believe there is such a thing as the mafia. A bunch of Italian guys goes out to eat and they say it's the mafia.\" The Bonannos are now rated as second only to the Genovese family and considered unlikely to be severely damaged, even if Mr Spero is found guilty. Daniel Castleman, of the Manhattan district attorney's office, said: \"They are the only family with an undisputed leadership and without serious internal struggles.\" That might be difficult for Mr Spero to accept when, on his outings from unfashionable Staten Island, he listens in court to at least a dozen organised crime figures giving evidence against him. He was charged with nearly 20 others. All but Mr Spero have pleaded guilty, and several are expected to give evidence against him. Mr Spero's lawyer, Gerald Shargel, told the court that the case against his client would rest on the word of self-confessed killers and drug peddlers. And, in any case, he said, \"Not one witness is going to come in here and say 'I had a conversation with Anthony Spero about murder' or anything like that.'\" Listening to Mr Shargel was Dan Grimaldi, who plays the part of Patsy Parisi in the new series of The Sopranos. \"I'm hoping that the truth comes out and that he's found not guilty of these terrible allegations,\" the actor, whose sister is Mr Spero's girlfriend, said. A family affair The acting boss of the Luchese crime family, Steven Crea, 53, is facing charges of extracting millions of dollars from New York City construction schemes through bribery and rigged bids. The Colombo family's boss, Carmine \"The Snake\" Persico , 67, is serving 139 years for murder and racketeering. The head of the Gambino family, John Gotti, 59, is dying of throat cancer while serving life for murder and racketeering. The Genovese family's boss, Vincent \"The Chin\" Gigante, 72, is serving 12 years for conspiracy to commit murder, racketeering and extortion. The head of the Bonanno family, Joseph Massino, 57, owns restaurant and food businesses.",

It's the only way to achieve true integration.\"</p> <p>To Salah Amakrone, who heads the group's list, the success of Les Motiv\u00e9-e-s reflects Toulousains' refusal to accept the way politics is currently practised. \"We have ensured that an awful lot of people will go out and vote who have never voted before ... That's a nice helping hand for democracy, isn't it?\" he said.</p> <p>Les Motiv\u00e9-e-s will probably form a coalition with the mainstream left between the two rounds of voting, tomorrow and March 18, if that will defeat the right. But they will refuse executive posts on the council, aiming rather to act as a two-way channel of information between the town hall and the suburbs.</p> <p>And while Mr Jospin seems likely to emerge as the overall winner tomorrow, he has taken good note of \"the messages, the rejections, the anger, the hopes and the fears\" revealed by Toulouse's unexpected support for Les Motiv\u00e9-e-s. For in the longer term it could be the whole bipolar tradition of mainstream French politics that is undermined.</p>",

If they decide to strike an alliance with the left, they could gain 16 or 17 councillors out of a total of 69. \"Toulouse is a wealthy city, the capital of the European aviation and aerospace industry, but it has a massive prob lem with social exclusion, with the integration of its immigrants,\" said Marie-Christine Etelin, a radical lawyer who is sixth on its list of candidates. She pointed out that a big proportion of Toulouse's inhabitants are of immigrant origin, be they Spanish, Algerian, Moroccan or Italian. It also has a strong radical tradition, having clutched to its rosy, brick-built heart thousands of anarcho-syndicalist Spaniards after the civil war. \"There are families who have been here for 40 years and still don't vote,\" said Ms Etelin, herself of Spanish extraction. \"We believe they have to become citizens in the full sense of the term, really be given all their rights and responsibilities. It's the only way to achieve true integration.\" To Salah Amakrone, who heads the group's list, the success of Les Motiv\u00e9-e-s reflects Toulousains' refusal to accept the way politics is currently practised. \"We have ensured that an awful lot of people will go out and vote who have never voted before ... That's a nice helping hand for democracy, isn't it?\" he said. Les Motiv\u00e9-e-s will probably form a coalition with the mainstream left between the two rounds of voting, tomorrow and March 18, if that will defeat the right. But they will refuse executive posts on the council, aiming rather to act as a two-way channel of information between the town hall and the suburbs. And while Mr Jospin seems likely to emerge as the overall winner tomorrow, he has taken good note of \"the messages, the rejections, the anger, the hopes and the fears\" revealed by Toulouse's unexpected support for Les Motiv\u00e9-e-s. For in the longer term it could be the whole bipolar tradition of mainstream French politics that is undermined.",

      "body": "<p>While I was away last week I saw a concert notice in the Times, assessing a performance which seems to have been almost perfect. But nothing is ever quite perfect, and the critic was on the lookout for flaws here and there. Were the horns, he inquired, a tad too refulgent? </p> <p>I am far too old and weary to claim that this criticism has never been uttered before. Should I do so, someone would swiftly write in claiming to have a tape of some reheasal in the Queen's Hall in which the orchestra's leader could be heard inquiring of Sir Thomas Beecham: \"Were the horns a bit too refulgent, your honour?\" to which the great man answered: \"A tad\". But never from now on will I go to a concert without probing the horns for excessive refulgence. This one sentence has changed the whole pattern of Smallweed's life. </p> <p><strong> A season ticket-holder writes: Could this perhaps be the same critic who wrote one day this week in a report of a Man United match that goalkeeper Fabien Barthez \"flaunted his florid resilience?\" </strong></p> <p><strong> Smallweed omnisciently replies: </strong> Perhaps. Next time I hear a great London orchestra, I shall be on the lookout for florid resilience too. If at any time I detect a moment of florid resilience on the part of refulgent horns, I shall leave the building immediately. I advise you to do the same. </p> <p> Sir Peregrine Worsthorne was interviewed this week about the case of a London headmaster who bans from his school young people caught using four-letter words. This Worsthorne, they told us, was only the second person to use what I suppose we must call the F word on the BBC's airwaves, but he clearly disapproved of mere teenage groundlings doing the same. He saw it as a form of dumbing down, of the whole of society adopting the practice of what I think he described as the bottom class. This is odd, as I'd always believed that the upper classes swore quite as freely as the plebs, with only the middle clases keeping their language clean. </p> <p>The oddest feature, however, was that Worsthorne described talk of this kind as something you heard on the top of a bus. I found it hard to grip the concept of Worsthorne on top of a bus, until I remembered that travelling pantheon, the number 94 from Piccadilly to Acton - surely the only bus on which such a fastidious fellow would deign to travel. Some time next week, shouldering aside such refulgent figures as George Steiner, Pierre Boulez, AS Byatt, JK Rowling and the late Isaiah Berlin, I shall force my way to the front of the upper deck in the hope of catching Sir P swearing away like billyo. </p> <p> <strong>The entrepreneur</strong> JC Bamford, who died the other day, achieved something which, according to my (often imperfect) research, has been done by no other.

      "bodyText": "While I was away last week I saw a concert notice in the Times, assessing a performance which seems to have been almost perfect. But nothing is ever quite perfect, and the critic was on the lookout for flaws here and there. Were the horns, he inquired, a tad too refulgent? I am far too old and weary to claim that this criticism has never been uttered before. Should I do so, someone would swiftly write in claiming to have a tape of some reheasal in the Queen's Hall in which the orchestra's leader could be heard inquiring of Sir Thomas Beecham: \"Were the horns a bit too refulgent, your honour?\" to which the great man answered: \"A tad\". But never from now on will I go to a concert without probing the horns for excessive refulgence. This one sentence has changed the whole pattern of Smallweed's life. A season ticket-holder writes: Could this perhaps be the same critic who wrote one day this week in a report of a Man United match that goalkeeper Fabien Barthez \"flaunted his florid resilience?\" Smallweed omnisciently replies: Perhaps. Next time I hear a great London orchestra, I shall be on the lookout for florid resilience too. If at any time I detect a moment of florid resilience on the part of refulgent horns, I shall leave the building immediately. I advise you to do the same. Sir Peregrine Worsthorne was interviewed this week about the case of a London headmaster who bans from his school young people caught using four-letter words. This Worsthorne, they told us, was only the second person to use what I suppose we must call the F word on the BBC's airwaves, but he clearly disapproved of mere teenage groundlings doing the same. He saw it as a form of dumbing down, of the whole of society adopting the practice of what I think he described as the bottom class. This is odd, as I'd always believed that the upper classes swore quite as freely as the plebs, with only the middle clases keeping their language clean. The oddest feature, however, was that Worsthorne described talk of this kind as something you heard on the top of a bus. I found it hard to grip the concept of Worsthorne on top of a bus, until I remembered that travelling pantheon, the number 94 from Piccadilly to Acton - surely the only bus on which such a fastidious fellow would deign to travel. Some time next week, shouldering aside such refulgent figures as George Steiner, Pierre Boulez, AS Byatt, JK Rowling and the late Isaiah Berlin, I shall force my way to the front of the upper deck in the hope of catching Sir P swearing away like billyo. The entrepreneur JC Bamford, who died the other day, achieved something which, according to my (often imperfect) research, has been done by no other. An object became known across the civilised world by his initials. In his case, the thing was an earth mover, or as we now say, JCB. For writers and artists to be known simply by their initials is no rare thing. I could if I chose, which I don't, cite GBS (George Bernard Shaw) or RLS (Robert Louis Stevenson).

They will value his findings - that Mr Mandelson did not deceive and that Mr Vaz's relationship with the Hinduja brothers was not \"improper\". Tony Blair, Jack Straw and Alastair Campbell have reasons to be less cheerful - but the real losers are the rest of us. For the Hammond report leaves as much of a muddle as it set out to clear up.</p> <p>The headlines belong, of course, to Mr Mandelson. He had feared a stitch-up at the hands of a retired civil servant once attached to the Home Office, the department which had played such a crucial part in his fall. In fact Sir Anthony has cleared him, declaring his version of events \"honestly held\" and finding he never lobbied on behalf of the Hindujas. That puts him in the clear, removing the second official stain on his character (the first, from his resignation in December 1998, remains). He can now move on.</p> <p>But Mr Mandelson's victory represents a defeat for Mr Blair. For if Sir Anthony has so effusively exonerated the former Northern Ireland secretary then why on earth did he lose his job? Mr Blair said yesterday that the inquiry's sole brief was to investigate claims of cash-for-passports corruption - not the rights and wrongs of Mr Mandelson's sacking. He is strictly right. Still, if this were a legal matter, Mr Mandelson could claim unfair dismissal by his previous employer and demand to be reinstated into his former job. But this is not law; this is politics. Cabinet appointment is a matter of prime ministerial pleasure: the whys and wherefores of late January matter less than the plain fact that Mr Mandelson lost the confidence of his patron. The forensics may be on Peter Mandelson's side, but the politics never were.</p> <p>Which is not to say that Mr Blair is in the clear. On the contrary, the fact that Sir Anthony could not find hard evidence that might have justified a sacking - like a clear record of a phone call between the immigration minister, Mike O'Brien, and Mr Mandelson, which the latter always denied - reflects badly on the PM. For it shows that Mr Blair acted in haste, pan icked by the media drumbeat which demanded a resolution of the Mandelson muddle. Rather than investigating first, then passing verdict and sentence later, Mr Blair reversed the process.</p> <p>The PM shoulders ultimate blame for that panic, but some of it also belongs to his chief press secretary. Sir Anthony makes clear that Alastair Campbell deepened the trouble in that fateful January week by straying beyond the form of words agreed with Mr Mandelson, so inviting a fresh round of media frenzy. It was he who let the news cycle drive events, rather than giving cooler judgment time to prevail. The party which mastered spin came to be mastered by it. That this happened is no surprise - not when we have a prime minister who has twice abased himself in grovelling articles written to placate the demands of the Sun. And who was the chief architect of New Labour's media-centred philosophy? Why, Peter Mandelson.</p> <p>There are other losers. Jack Straw clearly let both Mr Mandelson and Number 10 believe there was firm evidence of that phonecall with Mr O'Brien when there was none. He also went on television all but declaring Mr Mandelson a liar. More damaging still is Sir Anthony's discovery that Mr Straw told aides he wanted Prakash Hinduja's application for British citizenship to be dealt with \"helpfully\". The home secretary insisted that \"helpfully\" implied no special treatment and merely meant \"properly\". Such a stretch of the language recalls David Willetts' \"in want of advice\" remark in the bad old days of Tory sleaze.</p> <p>Yet Sir Anthony accepts it, just as he is untroubled to discover that there was damaging intelligence on the Hindujas which was never passed to the Home Office: he says it would not have made any difference to the final decision. That is typical of the report's complacency. It turns out to be a classic insiders' job, the cosy work of a civil servant who points no fingers and attaches responsibility to no one. Sir Anthony hears ten different versions of the same event and decides that every one is right. The result is to leave all players in this drama officially exonerated - but Whitehall itself exposed as the amateurish, back-covering world we had always feared.</p>",

That puts him in the clear, removing the second official stain on his character (the first, from his resignation in December 1998, remains). He can now move on. But Mr Mandelson's victory represents a defeat for Mr Blair. For if Sir Anthony has so effusively exonerated the former Northern Ireland secretary then why on earth did he lose his job? Mr Blair said yesterday that the inquiry's sole brief was to investigate claims of cash-for-passports corruption - not the rights and wrongs of Mr Mandelson's sacking. He is strictly right. Still, if this were a legal matter, Mr Mandelson could claim unfair dismissal by his previous employer and demand to be reinstated into his former job. But this is not law; this is politics. Cabinet appointment is a matter of prime ministerial pleasure: the whys and wherefores of late January matter less than the plain fact that Mr Mandelson lost the confidence of his patron. The forensics may be on Peter Mandelson's side, but the politics never were. Which is not to say that Mr Blair is in the clear. On the contrary, the fact that Sir Anthony could not find hard evidence that might have justified a sacking - like a clear record of a phone call between the immigration minister, Mike O'Brien, and Mr Mandelson, which the latter always denied - reflects badly on the PM. For it shows that Mr Blair acted in haste, pan icked by the media drumbeat which demanded a resolution of the Mandelson muddle. Rather than investigating first, then passing verdict and sentence later, Mr Blair reversed the process. The PM shoulders ultimate blame for that panic, but some of it also belongs to his chief press secretary. Sir Anthony makes clear that Alastair Campbell deepened the trouble in that fateful January week by straying beyond the form of words agreed with Mr Mandelson, so inviting a fresh round of media frenzy. It was he who let the news cycle drive events, rather than giving cooler judgment time to prevail. The party which mastered spin came to be mastered by it. That this happened is no surprise - not when we have a prime minister who has twice abased himself in grovelling articles written to placate the demands of the Sun. And who was the chief architect of New Labour's media-centred philosophy? Why, Peter Mandelson. There are other losers. Jack Straw clearly let both Mr Mandelson and Number 10 believe there was firm evidence of that phonecall with Mr O'Brien when there was none. He also went on television all but declaring Mr Mandelson a liar. More damaging still is Sir Anthony's discovery that Mr Straw told aides he wanted Prakash Hinduja's application for British citizenship to be dealt with \"helpfully\". The home secretary insisted that \"helpfully\" implied no special treatment and merely meant \"properly\". Such a stretch of the language recalls David Willetts' \"in want of advice\" remark in the bad old days of Tory sleaze. Yet Sir Anthony accepts it, just as he is untroubled to discover that there was damaging intelligence on the Hindujas which was never passed to the Home Office: he says it would not have made any difference to the final decision. That is typical of the report's complacency. It turns out to be a classic insiders' job, the cosy work of a civil servant who points no fingers and attaches responsibility to no one. Sir Anthony hears ten different versions of the same event and decides that every one is right. The result is to leave all players in this drama officially exonerated - but Whitehall itself exposed as the amateurish, back-covering world we had always feared.",

The tie could have sold out two or three times over. </p> <p>\"Tickets went on general sale last Sunday,\" Rogers says, \"and they were queuing up from 5am, three or four deep all the way around the ground. I suspect a lot of Tranmere fans started off as Reds and maybe under the surface are still slightly pink.

The 23-year-old striker has been handed the perfect stage to prove his self-proclaimed international credentials as Blackburn visit Highbury in pursuit of an FA Cup semi- final spot. </p> <p>\"The biggest difference between the First Division and the Premiership is that more football is played up there,\" he said. \"Our league is more physical and you can't get the ball down so much, but I think the game against Arsenal will be a good football match between two good footballing sides and it will definitely suit my game. </p> <p>\"We have already been to Derby in the Cup and put five past them. While that is unlikely to happen at Highbury, who knows what we could achieve if we play to our top form? It is a two-horse race and in that situation you must have a chance.\" </p> <p>Throughout his career Jansen has surprised many with his assured manner. In 1998 after a two-week trial at Old Trafford he turned down an opportunity to sign for Manchester United and moved to Crystal Palace instead, insisting he wanted first-team football.

He believes he has matured both on and off the pitch as the season has developed and said: \"The boss knows I disagree with him.

Souness has stated that, even if Blackburn make the final, the FA Cup will not be the priority this season. And their biggest fear for their visit to London appears to be that they may have to repeat the fixture in a fortnight's time.

      "bodyText": "If Matt Jansen fails to penetrate the Arsenal defence this afternoon it will not be because of a lack of confidence. The 23-year-old striker has been handed the perfect stage to prove his self-proclaimed international credentials as Blackburn visit Highbury in pursuit of an FA Cup semi- final spot. \"The biggest difference between the First Division and the Premiership is that more football is played up there,\" he said. \"Our league is more physical and you can't get the ball down so much, but I think the game against Arsenal will be a good football match between two good footballing sides and it will definitely suit my game. \"We have already been to Derby in the Cup and put five past them. While that is unlikely to happen at Highbury, who knows what we could achieve if we play to our top form?

      "byline": "Mike Wilson",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Peterhead went to bed on Tuesday night facing, so far as football was concerned, mixed blessings. If only the town could claim even that economically. The football club, enjoying their debut season in the Scottish Football League, have been a rare ray of light in the north. </p> <p>First Division Livingston had sprung a cup surprise by beating Aberdeen that night, but they had also denied Peterhead a local derby and all the passion and hard cash that entailed. The consolation is that Livingston are a division closer to Peterhead's new Third Division habitat. But since the West Lothian club are riding the crest of a wave at the top of the First Division, perhaps it is no consolation at all. </p> <p>Nevertheless the prospect of a Third Division club making the semi-finals is heady stuff. The other quarter-final ties are all Scottish Premier League affairs but Peterhead's visit to Livingston means that one of the semi-final berths will be taken by a club outside the top 12. Both sides are in their first ever quarter-final. </p> <p>It is because the SPL was expanded from 10 to 12 clubs that Peterhead and Elgin City made the journey from Highland League to Scottish Football League. Of the two newcomers, Peterhead have had a better time of it. </p> <p>\"It's not been too bad this season,\" says their chairman Roger Taylor. \"But I don't want to stay in the Third Division. I am pleased; we have been feeling our way in the league and it looks like we are set to finish mid-table. It's a basis for improving the team for next season. Rome wasn't built in a day.\" </p> <p>The part-timers, who this time last year were being beaten 2-0 by Buckie Thistle in the Highland League, are managed by the former Scotland, Leicester City and Everton midfielder Ian Wilson. He brings to the job his experience in Turkey and Japan as assistant to the much-travelled former Coventry manager Gordon Milne. </p> <p>\"It would have been a dream come true had it been Aberdeen, but we are now looking forward to Livingston,\" says Wilson. \"It's important everyone tries to enjoy this fairytale run as much as possible. </p> <p>\"Livingston have Premier League-quality players; they will be as tough as Aberdeen would have been. It would be foolish for us to play any other way than we normally do, which is about controlling and passing the ball. We are not about launching the long ball. We'll stick to our principles.

      "bodyText": "Peterhead went to bed on Tuesday night facing, so far as football was concerned, mixed blessings. If only the town could claim even that economically. The football club, enjoying their debut season in the Scottish Football League, have been a rare ray of light in the north. First Division Livingston had sprung a cup surprise by beating Aberdeen that night, but they had also denied Peterhead a local derby and all the passion and hard cash that entailed. The consolation is that Livingston are a division closer to Peterhead's new Third Division habitat. But since the West Lothian club are riding the crest of a wave at the top of the First Division, perhaps it is no consolation at all. Nevertheless the prospect of a Third Division club making the semi-finals is heady stuff. The other quarter-final ties are all Scottish Premier League affairs but Peterhead's visit to Livingston means that one of the semi-final berths will be taken by a club outside the top 12. Both sides are in their first ever quarter-final. It is because the SPL was expanded from 10 to 12 clubs that Peterhead and Elgin City made the journey from Highland League to Scottish Football League. Of the two newcomers, Peterhead have had a better time of it. \"It's not been too bad this season,\" says their chairman Roger Taylor. \"But I don't want to stay in the Third Division. I am pleased; we have been feeling our way in the league and it looks like we are set to finish mid-table. It's a basis for improving the team for next season. Rome wasn't built in a day.\" The part-timers, who this time last year were being beaten 2-0 by Buckie Thistle in the Highland League, are managed by the former Scotland, Leicester City and Everton midfielder Ian Wilson. He brings to the job his experience in Turkey and Japan as assistant to the much-travelled former Coventry manager Gordon Milne. \"It would have been a dream come true had it been Aberdeen, but we are now looking forward to Livingston,\" says Wilson. \"It's important everyone tries to enjoy this fairytale run as much as possible. \"Livingston have Premier League-quality players; they will be as tough as Aberdeen would have been. It would be foolish for us to play any other way than we normally do, which is about controlling and passing the ball. We are not about launching the long ball. We'll stick to our principles. Sitting back and defending would be asking for trouble.\" Taylor confesses to having followed Aberdeen home and away before being asked to get involved with the seaside town club, which became a plc in 1993, nine years after the club escaped bankruptcy thanks partly to the players volunteering to go a whole season without pay. A deal with a supermarket chain means they play in a new stadium which has boasted a second stand since January 27, an auspicious day in more ways than one. It is unfair to say Peterhead's progress in the cup owes everything to one result. But after shocking First Division Morton 4-1 on January 27 they were the fortunate recipients of a bye to this round because of Airdrie's inability to muster a team. \"I wouldn't say we are here under false pretences,\" says Taylor. \"The Airdrie situation was not our problem and there is no one who would knock back a bye if offered.\" Peterhead's best cup run was in the 1987-88 season when they lost a fourth-round second replay to Raith Rovers.

Taxis, it seems, have played a crucial role in transforming a player who was still awaiting his first Spurs start on Boxing Day into a key figure for tomorrow's FA Cup quarter-final at West Ham. </p> <p>\"I was taking the train from my parents' house in Luton to training earlier in the season, which probably affected my football,\" says Doherty, whose rapid rise is the more remarkable given that he was signed from the Second Division Hatters less than a year ago. </p> <p>\"I was getting up really early and having a two-hour trek on the train, which is not good for anybody. So I started taking taxis and, even though it cost more, my football started taking off from that point. Now that I've moved into my own place two minutes up the road it's easy.\" </p> <p>Win a make-or-break game at Upton Park and the Spurs players may do well to leave in armoured cars. The 0-0 draw between the sides there on January 31 suggests a tight match and, whatever Chas and Dave think, Doherty is not counting on victory because the year ends in one. </p> <p>\"It's a bit of an annoying thing really because it's taken a lot of credit away from our performances,\" he says of the White Hart Lane superstition. \"The comeback against Charlton was great but most people said it was bound to happen because of the year. If we win the FA Cup it's down to us having a good season.\" </p> <p>It will, in no small way, be down to the versatile Doherty as well. Having scored the winner in the third round at Leyton Orient, he played a major part in transforming a 2-0 deficit into a 4-2 victory at the Valley. Operating in his less favoured centre-forward position, he started the comeback with a fine run and cross which forced Richard Rufus into an own-goal. </p> <p>With Spurs underachieving in the league, he recognises the need to win this trophy. \"We're a massive club so we should be in Europe,\" he says. </p> <p>The good news for him is that he will be employed at the back tomorrow. His three international caps have come as a striker and he made his \"nightmare\" first Spurs start at Ipswich on December 30 up front, but the Spurs manager George Graham and the Republic coach Mick McCarthy see his future in defence. </p> <p>\"To play in the Premiership as a forward you have to be a really special player,\" Doherty says. \"You have got to have a quick brain like Robbie Keane or be powerful like John Hartson or Mark Viduka, and I don't think I'm either of them at the moment. Centre-half comes easier to me and I feel I've got the attributes to become a more established Premiership player there.\" </p> <p>Strong in the air and in the tackle but also neat on the floor, Doherty has proved the worth of Spurs' policy of buying young, lower division talent. Simon Davies, Matthew Etherington and Anthony Gardner show signs of doing likewise. Doherty appreciates he has come a long way fast. </p> <p>\"There's still a wow when I look at the players I'm playing against,\" he says. \"There are no soft teams. Maybe in Division Two you go into a game against some sides and know it won't be as hard as others. </p> <p>\"In the Premiership it's a lot harder and a lot more physical but I've coped well so far and hopefully I can carry on. I think I've played 12 or 13 on the bounce now and I didn't expect to do that. I just wanted to be on the fringe of the team and maybe mount a good push next season.\" </p> <p>Having exceeded expectations he hopes to make the Ireland squad for the World Cup qualifier against Cyprus this month. Part of the Ireland team, along with Keane, that won the Under-18 European Championship, Doherty's accent may be as Irish as Andy Townsend's but he was born in Donegal and moved to Luton aged six. </p> <p>If he achieves as much as his boyhood idol Paul McGrath he will be happy. \"He was always my main hero because of the World Cup and he was such a relaxed player,\" Doherty says. \"I was lucky enough to play alongside him at centre-half in his testimonial, which was a great experience in front of 40,000 people.\" </p> <p>He hopes for another great experience in front of 25,000 tomorrow.

Was there anyone reading the reports of the new deal in the papers this week who didn't lose the will to live by the final paragraph? There seems almost a deliberate attempt to make the conclusions as hard to understand as possible. Though one or two things do emerge from the fog: that there will still be cash compensation for movements between clubs, and that bigger clubs will be better compensated. </p> <p>\"Looking at this, I can't see it having a deflationary effect on the level of transfers,\" says Taylor. \"There has been a lot of fuss for two years leading to not a lot of definition about where we are going to go. Even before the Bosman ruling we had tribunals at the end of the season deciding values, so I can't see much difference with this.\" </p> <p>And if you wonder why there has been all the obfuscation, just look at who had the most to benefit from keeping the new rules as ambiguous as possible: the big clubs.

Anxious to be seen to be doing something, the commission dressed up the same old monetary exchange in as arcane a formula as it could manage, in the hope that no-one would notice it had caved in. </p> <p>Which leaves the players no better off than they were under the old, semi-feudal system, still counted as commodities and still without the freedom of moving their labour most of us enjoy. So what is Taylor, who is also the chairman of Fifpro, the international players union, going to do about the new treaty for football? </p> <p>\"That's a very good question,\" he tells me, \"and one much easier to ask than to answer. There's so much detail here, it's far from clear. So the first thing I'm going to do about it is take the report home and study it carefully.\" Looks like a fun weekend ahead. </p> <p>And if you're wondering what ever happened to new-recipe Coke, it was abandoned after less than six months in production. No one could quite see the point of it. The old recipe might have rotted your teeth, but at least you knew where you were. </p> <p><strong>Time for Old Trafford to stand up and be counted</strong></p> <p>\"There is a serious possibility of an accident and the council cannot afford to turn a blind eye.\" So says Barry Brotherton of Stretford council, explaining why he may be forced to close parts of Old Trafford because the ground breaches health and safety regulations. </p> <p>The cause of the potential accident? Fans standing during matches. As dangerous acts go, I wasn't aware standing was up there with leaping from 20-storey tower blocks or swallowing razor blades. People seem to get by without damage, say, while standing at bus stops. Or in the queue at Stretford town hall waiting to pay their council tax. </p> <p>Standing is something most of us manage to perform several times a day without doing ourselves long term injury. Apart of course from Darren Anderton. Indeed, since Old Trafford became an all-seater stadium seven years ago, several thousand occupants of the sections behind the goals have stood throughout matches without any pain except in the necks of those who might prefer to sit down. </p> <p>As an experiment in safe terracing - light years from the fenced-in death-traps of Hillsborough - it has been clear-cut. But the local council reckons safety has been so compromised that it is prepared to close down a section accommodating as many as 5,000 season-ticket holders. </p> <p>In which case, as there is nowhere else to put them with every other seat taken, they will effectively be banned from the stadium. You wonder if Stretford council's safety officers have considered the implications of that. If I were them, I would be consulting my lawyer. </p> <p><strong> Stan, an enigma wrapped up in self parody</strong></p> <p>The most depressing thing about growing old is the way time accelerates, eventually to breakneck speed. But no one's chronology has headed off at quite the warp factor of that of Stan Collymore, who this week announced himself a pensioner at 30. </p> <p>Stan's modus operandi throughout his career was this: he would become disenchanted with his lot at a club, fall out with the manager or team mates then agitate for a move. Another team would come in, hoping they might be the ones to unlock his majestic skills. On arrival at the new club he would announce he had come home, slag off his old employers and play a blinder on his debut. </p> <p>But Stan trouble would soon reappear; before long he would be back at the beginning, disenchanted again. As he got older, the gap between the two points on the Collymore employment graph grew ever closer, from a couple of years at Liverpool to a couple of weeks at Real Oviedo. </p> <p>Magnificently, in Spain he even missed out the inconvenience of actually having to start a match, moving from making extravagant claims about the hospitality of his new employers to retiring, with only three games as a sub in between. But you couldn't accuse him of hiding his intentions. A fortnight ago he said he wanted to end his career in Spain. It was just that nobody realised he meant 10 days later. If only he could have played football with the same consistency he showed for self-parody, the man might have been an England stalwart. </p> <p>The word \"enigma\" was used more than once in the obituaries of his career that littered the papers this week. But none of the send-offs were as succinct as a comment Alan Smith, the Crystal Palace manager, once made about the player he coached in his youth. \"In the end, I don't think he was in love with football,\" said Smith. That was probably what it was about all along.</p>",

And if you're wondering what ever happened to new-recipe Coke, it was abandoned after less than six months in production. No one could quite see the point of it. The old recipe might have rotted your teeth, but at least you knew where you were. Time for Old Trafford to stand up and be counted \"There is a serious possibility of an accident and the council cannot afford to turn a blind eye.\" So says Barry Brotherton of Stretford council, explaining why he may be forced to close parts of Old Trafford because the ground breaches health and safety regulations. The cause of the potential accident? Fans standing during matches. As dangerous acts go, I wasn't aware standing was up there with leaping from 20-storey tower blocks or swallowing razor blades. People seem to get by without damage, say, while standing at bus stops. Or in the queue at Stretford town hall waiting to pay their council tax. Standing is something most of us manage to perform several times a day without doing ourselves long term injury. Apart of course from Darren Anderton. Indeed, since Old Trafford became an all-seater stadium seven years ago, several thousand occupants of the sections behind the goals have stood throughout matches without any pain except in the necks of those who might prefer to sit down. As an experiment in safe terracing - light years from the fenced-in death-traps of Hillsborough - it has been clear-cut. But the local council reckons safety has been so compromised that it is prepared to close down a section accommodating as many as 5,000 season-ticket holders. In which case, as there is nowhere else to put them with every other seat taken, they will effectively be banned from the stadium. You wonder if Stretford council's safety officers have considered the implications of that. If I were them, I would be consulting my lawyer. Stan, an enigma wrapped up in self parody The most depressing thing about growing old is the way time accelerates, eventually to breakneck speed. But no one's chronology has headed off at quite the warp factor of that of Stan Collymore, who this week announced himself a pensioner at 30. Stan's modus operandi throughout his career was this: he would become disenchanted with his lot at a club, fall out with the manager or team mates then agitate for a move. Another team would come in, hoping they might be the ones to unlock his majestic skills. On arrival at the new club he would announce he had come home, slag off his old employers and play a blinder on his debut. But Stan trouble would soon reappear; before long he would be back at the beginning, disenchanted again. As he got older, the gap between the two points on the Collymore employment graph grew ever closer, from a couple of years at Liverpool to a couple of weeks at Real Oviedo. Magnificently, in Spain he even missed out the inconvenience of actually having to start a match, moving from making extravagant claims about the hospitality of his new employers to retiring, with only three games as a sub in between. But you couldn't accuse him of hiding his intentions. A fortnight ago he said he wanted to end his career in Spain. It was just that nobody realised he meant 10 days later. If only he could have played football with the same consistency he showed for self-parody, the man might have been an England stalwart. The word \"enigma\" was used more than once in the obituaries of his career that littered the papers this week. But none of the send-offs were as succinct as a comment Alan Smith, the Crystal Palace manager, once made about the player he coached in his youth. \"In the end, I don't think he was in love with football,\" said Smith. That was probably what it was about all along.",

A year ago, the then CGU (now Norwich Union) Monthly Income Plus advertised \"a consistent monthly income to keep you going\" and a level \"which is both high and stable\". Income and capital values both fell.",

However, by the time Trittico hit the stage, 18 years later, things had changed somewhat. Hell and purgatory remained: the first of the three operas, Il Tabarro, deals with a deterministic emotional inferno played out in a setting of almost Zola-esque drabness; the second, Suor Angelica, blends torment, salvation and moral questioning. But the final opera portrays a world far from heavenly. Gianni Schicchi is a bitter comedy on the nature of human venality, populated by, arguably, the most obnoxious line-up of characters ever assembled on the operatic stage. </p> <p>Patrick Mason's ENO production, now on its first revival, doesn't quite get the ambiguous emotional balance right. Gianni Schicchi is, to a certain extent, its weak link, despite a charismatic, forceful and gleefully witty performance in the title role from Andrew Shore. Mason shies away from the opera's inherent nastiness, veering towards slapstick and gaudy caricature. His insights are only intermittently telling. Schicchi's daughter Lauretta, usually played as a romantic drip, is shown to be as manipulative as the rest of the crew. At the end of the opera she calmly prepares to consummate her passion for Rinuccio in the bed of the deceased Donati, whose lucre everyone has been intent on grabbing. </p> <p>However, the tone doesn't always cohere, and Mason seems much happier with the other two operas. Angelica's convent, a breezeblock structure stalked by stroppy wardresses, is as much a prison as a place of spiritual refuge. Mason updates Tabarro to the years following the first world war, presenting a gallery of compassionately observed, damaged people who play out their tragedy in a smoky landscape that turns a hellish red. </p> <p>Il Tabarro is very much the high point, boasting an outstanding performance from Peter Coleman-Wright as Michele. Animalistic, sexual and dangerous, he tracks Cheryl Barker's sluttish yet sympathetic Giorgetta with a painful intensity. As Giorgetta's lover, Bonaventura Bottone suggests a certain emotional vapidity, a telling weakness of will. Barker, in radiant voice throughout, returns in part two as a nerve-shredding Angelica, with a performance guaranteed to move you to tears. Anne-Marie Owens is less than ideally vicious as her implacable, persecuting aunt. </p> <p>Despite some overdone antics, the ensemble that swirls round Shore's Schicchi is exceptional. In the pit, Noel Davies gets to the heart of each opera, contrasting perfectly Tabarro's brooding darkness with Angelica's chromatic, modal mystery and Schicchi's razor-sharp clarity. It is a flawed evening, though the best of it is unquestionably tremendous. </p> <p>\u0095 In rep until April 7. Box office: 020-7632 8300. </p>",

Anne-Marie Owens is less than ideally vicious as her implacable, persecuting aunt. Despite some overdone antics, the ensemble that swirls round Shore's Schicchi is exceptional. In the pit, Noel Davies gets to the heart of each opera, contrasting perfectly Tabarro's brooding darkness with Angelica's chromatic, modal mystery and Schicchi's razor-sharp clarity. It is a flawed evening, though the best of it is unquestionably tremendous. \u0095 In rep until April 7. Box office: 020-7632 8300.",

Secondly, there will also be loans on offer for groups to take up when major work is needed on common parts, such as when a lift fails and its sinking fund won't stretch to cover the cost of the repairs. </p> <p>It will also lend money to cover financial shortfalls when there are short-term liquidity problems. The bank will look upon the ground rent and service or maintenance charges that leaseholders pay to the RMC as security for the loan. </p> <p>In addition, the bank has drawn up an insurance package to meet the needs of the RMCs and directors' liabilities. </p> <p> While there is a great deal of support for changes that pass the power from unscrupulous freeholders to leaseholders who own the flats, few see commonhold as a panacea. Residents who want to manage themselves still have to deal with problems of financial management, says Mr Walker. </p> <p>These include how to ensure transparency in the running of a block. RMCs will also have to grapple with how to ensure leaseholders don't fall into arrears with charges and how to ensure funds are available to cover running costs if some flat owners pay late. </p> <p>Leaseholders will need all the support they can get, says Mr Walker. \"For most, it will be the first time they have become involved in running a company.\" There is a danger that the neighbours who volunteer to run the RMC could be worse than the freeholder the leaseholders dumped.
